,,Never Ever Miss This,5.0,,"This temple has 5 floors. I do recommend you to visit every floor. I did plan only half and hour for this temple, but in reality I stayed there for 2 hours. Although it locates in China town which is a very busy area but this place is really tranquil.
Walls of the first floor are decorated with lots of Buddha statues. Buddha statues represent zodiacs.
A square walk way on the second floor exhibits story of Buddha in Singapore. Also many souvenirs from visitors are presented here.
There is a small but nice museum of Buddha in this region on 3rd floor. Also many Buddha relics presented here.
On 4th floor, the Buddha tooth relic is presented in golden stupa. Also floor tiles are made from gold. There are meditation area on both sides. It is really peaceful supporting meditation.
Roof top is also nice with small garden growing orchids. There is a big bell you can walk and hold a rank walking around for meditation."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This temple is quite beautiful. You walk in and they will give you a sarong to cover up for free. It is interesting to walk around and read about a different religion from my own.
,,Beautiful and tranquil,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. The temple is stunning and allows you to visit all the levels - museum, history, orchid garden and the main temple itself. Very interesting as you learn about the building and the religion."
,,Beautiful tranquil temple,5.0,,Free to walk around. 4 floors including a roof garden. Lots to look at and read (if you’re inclined).
,,Don't miss the orchid garden on the roof,5.0,,"It's easy to think that the ground floor is the only part to see. But if you go to the right you can go up in the lift to see the temple of the Tooth, orchid roof gardens, museum and I believe you can get vegetarian food in the basement.
Not to be missed.
Remember to cover knees and shoulders (although there are scarfs and sarongs available to borrow)"
,,Fascinating and beautiful,4.0,,This Buddhist temple was as magnificent as Cathedrals in Italy with really beautiful artifacts. The had thousands of mini Buddha’s lining every wall on every floor. The rooftop garden was a delightful surprise.
,,Buddist Culture,4.0,,I enjoyed seeing the architecture inside and out. There is also a museum. It is currently under construction.
,,"Hidden within China Town, you must go",5.0,,this is an amazing place. One should always make time to visit this amazing temple somewhere within China Town.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"we went to Chinatown to visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and walk around the neighborhood. The Temple is beautiful, you can really feel the peace and serenity of the religion with a brief visit."
,,Excellent must visit,5.0,,"We went to look at the temple which was very nice inside. We did not know that it was also a museum. You can catch a lift to level 4, then walk up the stairs to the roof gardens, very nice. Then there are 3 floors of museum to look at. We stayed from the roof garden and worked our way down. The people looking after the temple were very nice. This is a must visit when you go to Chinatown"
,,Amazing interior,4.0,,"The temple is filled with beautiful and interesting artifacts and architecture. Gold is used throughout and makes the temple have a glow to it. When you visit, make sure to cover your shoulders and legs - this applies to women for sure. I was given a shawl to cover my shoulders as I had a tank dress on. It was amazing to see the hundred Buddha statues on the first floor. My son and I just stared for a second as our senses were a little overwhelmed. Then there’s an elevator to the fourth floor which is where the tooth is located. It is enshrined in an enclosure and close circuit television allows you to look at the tooth. Was informed no one other than the most senior of monks are allowed into the area. I don’t know if I believe the tooth belonged to Buddha but the temple itself is amazing to visit. Because we were with a tour we didn’t have time to properly wander in the temple but our brief visit still left an impression of wonder. Will have to come again to see the things we missed."
,,Mesmerizing,4.0,,I liked the colors and the statues in this temple. It feels very serene and calm inside. There are lot of local people who come and offer prayers.
,,Don’t skip the museum,5.0,,"The museum has an over view of the Buddhist faith and a time line of the life of the Buddha. It helps understand if you are of another faith, we met a man who also helped explain concepts. There were prayers going on this visit which was good to experience."
,,Interesting temple,4.0,,Visited here off the Hop-on-hop-off bus. It is a busy temple and visitors are welcome to enter. Very interesting
,,A Real Gem,5.0,,"If touring Singapore is only about parties, rooftop vistas, and the best Singapore Sling, then PLEASE skip this temple.

This place is for non-Buddhists/Hindus who have a curiosity about other cultures, appreciation of what the Buddha and his followers have brought to the world, or genuinely desire some calm tranquility along their journey, OR for Buddhists/Hindus/followers of Dharmic philosophy that have a devotional attachment to the connection that this Temple offers.

It is amazing to think we have access to a part of the Buddha’s mortal body from 2,500 years ago, and that the Temple has been created so thoughtfully and allows for visitors to interact so deeply with everything there is truly open and generous.

It will always feature on my visits to Singapore."
,,Unforgettable experience,5.0,,Build in 2007 I came here the second time already. Beside the architecture it’s a very nice Buddhist temple. So color and peaceful. If any place would be like this! If you come to Singapore it’s a must.
,,Very nice structure,4.0,,The temple was very nice and a lot of people come by to see it. It's a must see place in Chinatown. I like how the temple was built.
,,Nice spot in Chinatown,4.0,,"If you are a Buddhist, this is a must see. Part of one of Buhha's teeth! If you are interested in Buddhism, there are 4 floors to investigate, relax and picture. Easily accessible in Chinatown."
,,Not extraordinary if you’re not Buddhist,3.0,,The temple was nice and it was interesting to go on the full moon but it if you’re not a Buddhist it’s not really extraordinary. Definitely not a highlight of our trip.
,,Beautiful Chinese temple,3.0,,One of place in Chinatown that have to check-in with beautiful structure and local people. Easy to travel with MRT or bus.
,,Popular attraction,4.0,,"Wraps are available at the entrances at either side for anyone in shorts or a short skirt. Very popular, make sure you go up to the very top floor to see the rooftop and prayer wheel there."
,,Quick visit,4.0,,Thus was a fascinating place to visit. We even saw people worshipping inside. They have a security guard to ensure respect is shown to Buddha.
,,Well worth a look,5.0,,We visited the Buddha Tooth relic temple whilst walking around Chinatown and were rewarded with a very memorable time. The main Buddha Tooth Relic room on the 4th floor is beautiful with magnificent gold tiles and solid gold stupa housing the Budda relic. The room is both very beautiful but also so calming. The roof garden is also lovely o visit. The main temple prayer room on the ground floor and the other floors explaining the Buddhist religion were also very informative and well worth a visit.
,,Majestic,5.0,,"Absolutely majestic temple with no entrance fee. Stunning architecture and design, colorful Buddha idols adorn all the walls . The temple invokes a feeling of peace and tranquility. We attended during mass on Sunday afternoon and could listen to the chanting. No photos are allowed inside the main relic temple.. Appropriate dress is required, Shoulders and legs must be covered to enter, there are scarfs and sarongs at the entrance for visitors to use free of charge."
,,Very interesting place,4.0,,Gorgeous to look at from the outside. Inside is interesting and you are able to take photo's no problem. There was a 'service' going on when we visited which just added to the experience.
,,Very beautiful temple and museum,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a Buddhist temple located in the Chinatown district of Singapore. The temple is based on Tang-styled Chinese Buddhist temple architectural style.
Shi Fa Zhao, the current president and abbot of Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, was approached by STB in 1998 to develop a proposal for a temple on the vacant site. As a result, the temple was built in 2007."
,,Chinese new year prayers,5.0,,This place reeks of all things traditional and the people at this temple are all very friendly and helpful.
,,Beautiful!!!,4.0,,It is a beautiful temple which is worth a visit if you are in Chinatown. Something not to be missed.
,,Centerpiece of Chinatown,4.0,,"This was the main attraction for the Chinatown component of out tour and it was most impressive. Erected by local Chinese, the reliquary contains the tooth of the Buddha and a whole trove of Buddhist iconography laid out across several floors. With ample information, a large temple, and several spots to rest, meditate and contemplate, it's well worth a few hours to get the flavor of local Buddhist culture."
,,Impressive and Beautiful,4.0,,A fascinating collection of art and sacred objects. Well worth your time and respect when you are in Chinatown.
,,Check out the tooth relic of Buddha!,5.0,,"Beautiful temple. It’s free, except for the top floor where the Buddha Tooth Relic resides surrounded by gold flooring. There are also sarongs to borrow to go inside. In one room, there are over 100 Buddha’s, all done by individual artists and in different poses."
,,Amazing - gutted we didnt go inside!,4.0,,We only went in an evening but it looked fantastic outside and so pretty in the heart of bustling chinatown
,,Culture and History,5.0,,Amazing architecture and serene environment! This place is a mixture of culture and history coming together!
,,Stunning.,5.0,,"This temple has so much to view. From the main hall where there were prayers being read, to the walkways around the temple showing the history, artefacts, statues, and smaller prayer/ meditation areas. There are many floors and even a roof garden where you can ring the prayer bell.
It is an incredible place. I’d highly recommend a visit if visiting Singapore.
There is a dress code but if you are not wearing appropriate clothing there is access to sarongs and scarfs to use during the visit"
,,Nicely kept temple!,4.0,,"Hello!

This temple is well kept and worth a visit! We arrived early in the morning and was able to observe morning ceremonies/prayer (I am not sure exactly what they were doing so it's a general statement). If you are in the area check it out!"
,,Wonderful temple and museum,5.0,,"A new building, beautifully decorated inside with many Buddha images and spectacularly built outside. Lots of gold used to highlight the decorations in a variety of places. Many beautiful Buddha statues, including some very large ones. Prayers of various kinds were taking place when we visited. An interesting museum upstairs and a nice roof garden further upstairs. Certainly worth a visit."
,,"Grand architecture, lovely ornamentation",4.0,,Impressive and imposing temple. Lavish decoration throughout. Must-see on a swing around Chinatown. Easily accessible from metro.
,,Nice modern Chinese temple,4.0,,"This is a recently constructed but impressive Chinese temple located on South Bridge Road in Chinatown. When I visited here I found the place quite crowded. Tourists were both inside and out. In addition, the central area of the temple has lots of seats which were occupied by mostly elderly visitors.

The interior of the temple is large and quite impressive and very ornate in mostly red and gold with lots of colourful statues of Buddha on the two side walls. Particularly of interest is the architecture which is most noticeable from the outside.

Being close to most of the attractions in Chinatown I would definitely recommend visiting this beautiful temple."
,,Serene,5.0,,"A very peaceful early morning visit. Sarongs and wraps are available for ladies to cover up before entering, men too are advised to dress up conservatively. You may light an incense at the entry. Very intricate carvings on the walls with Buddha depicted in varying mudras. Stop to read all display boards, they describe in great detail the Buddhist religion customs and traditions."
,,Nice place to visit for tourists in Singapore,4.0,,"Beautiful, calm and peaceful, strong aura and pleasant to hear the chanting and prayers that causes a positive vibration throughout the temple. The architecture is beautiful and every part of the temple has something to admire. Must also visit Level 4 for the tooth relic and level 5 at the rooftop for a complete experience."
,,All good!!!,5.0,,"It was a great experience there!!! Also,the people were nice there! The surrounding is also clean and very beautiful... Hope to go there again to pray to Buddha! I would highly recommend you to visit the temple if you are going to Singapore..."
,,"Expected more, but still nice",4.0,,I sure expected more but the temple was still nice. Best temple in the Chinatown for sure. And free admission.
,,Interesting to visit,3.0,,"Interesting to walk around, and to see all the displays. Make sure you go up to the other levels and see all the display cases. There are wraps availalbe at the entrance for ladies to cover up if wearing shorts."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,It’s beautiful temple right in China town I been here many time !! It’s so beautiful inside but can be very busy with tourists!!
,,"Very nice, its huge and well decorated",4.0,,"The temple is very nice, there are lots of beautiful statues, golden details , high ceilling it is quite worthy to visit this temple!"
,,This place is something else,4.0,,"I wonder if anyone has ever counted how many Buddhas are here. They certainly line the walls with them. It doesn't really look quite natural to me, and I had a thought that the Buddhas were suffocating. Certainly very beautiful and ornate though. Evidently they have a serious Buddha's relic here with the tooth. They won't let you photograph it or the room it's in on the third floor I think it is. On the roof is a nice little garden of sorts."
,,Absolutely Fantastic - Don't Miss this Temple!,5.0,,"Ornately decorated - a feast for the eyes. And, if you're in the right mood, one for the soul as well. As well an opportunity to learn a bit about Mahayana Buddhism - Chinese style.

Six storeys.

Ground Floor.

100 Dragons Hall (main hall) dedicated to the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya. In the middle with two Boddhisatvas on either side.

You'll notice immediately that this Buddha is not in a typical Asian posture nor in traditional Buddha garb. Rather he's in what's known as the ""European"" posture, i.e., seated on a chair or throne and wearing royal not monkly clothes. Notice the crown. Waiting his time to come to preach the dharma.

Ornate decorations. The walls are flanked with small Buddha statues in a variety of mudra poses set amongst smaller Buddha statues. An imposing and peaceful ensemble.

If you come at the right time, the main hall may be filled with worshipers reciting a sutra. When we came it was the Great Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom Practice led by a row of monks and a hall almost filled with laypersons.

Behind the main hall is the Universal Wisdom Hall where there are statues/shrines for each of the 8 protector Buddhas and Bodhisatvas of the 12 zodiac signs. Some do more than one sign (year) Find your birth year animal and your protector.. And join worshipers in making an offering to your protector.

When we were here in April, the temple was holding a blessing for the 1000 armed Avalokiteshvara Zodia protector. It appears that each month they hold a blessing for the Protector of a different zodiac sign. So there was a double ceremony.

Dominating this hall is the statue of the six-handed Boddhisatva Cintamanicakra Avalokisteshvara holding the wish fulfilling jewel (cintamani). Devotees come to pray for fulfillment of a wish. Behind the Boddhisatva is the Chinese text of the Heart Sutra - which is associated with him/her.

Mezzanine

A variety of exhibits. Famous monks. Ancestor hall (more of a shrine). Shrine of South Seas Freedom Avalokisteshvara in feminine form - Guan Yin.

Second Floor

Dedicated to Manjushri - Boddhisatva of Wisdom as is fitting he's flanked by a reproduction of the entire Maha Prajna Paramita Sutra, specially made for BTRTS.

Third Floor

Relics of the Buddha Shakyamuni and a statue of Boddhisatva Samantabhadra (associated with meditation and practice of Buddhism). In the center on the hall/ relic display is one of the iconic Buddhist trinities - Buddha Shayaymuni in the center flanked by Boddhisatva Manjushri (on the right as you look at the statues) and the Boddhisatva Samantabhadra (on the left). The trinity represents the unity of wisdom, practice and meditation with and within the dharma.

Fourth Floor

The inner and outer chambers of the Buddha Tooth Relic. Richly decorated. No pictures allowed but there are some on the BTRTS website. The inner chamber is behind glass and reserved for monks only. There are places for meditation and prayer.

Roof

Dedicated to Tibetan influenced Buddhism. A garden and pavilions. Very large Tibetan style prayer wheel (Vairocana). Statues of the five Dhyani Buddhas. A pleasant oasis.

There's a lot to see here. We've been here more than 3 times and next time we're in Singapore will go back to see what we missed. Or what we didn't see in enough detail.

One tip.

Take a look at the BTRTS website for in depth descriptions of each floor before you go. That will greatly enrich your experience.

They also provide free tours: one in Mandarin and the other in English, but you need to register beforehand. Check out their website."
,,Beautiful and ornate,4.0,,"As a former teacher of Religious Studies i found this place quite fascinating. The place is quite beautiful and ornate with vibrant colurs and thousands of statues. The main hall is very busy with people praying and being led in worship by a group of monks.
I did not have time to visit the actual 'relic' itself or to see more than the main areas on the ground floor and look around the outside of the building but it is well worth a visit, especially if you have an interest in comparitive religion."
,,Great temple,5.0,,"Came in during the holy festival of the Buddhist religion. It was very busy. Interesting to note how people from a different religion and culture pray. The tooth relic itself is located on the 4th floor and on the roof, there is more to the museum as well as some kind of garden. Great place to visit."
,,There is more to see than just the tooth.,4.0,,"We were surprised by how big this temple is and how much there is to see, when you first arrive you enter the grand hall and there are people there doing readings, teachings and chanting. You can have a look around and at the statues but you can also go up to each floor to find toher things such as the tooth and antiques."
,,Beautiful temple.,3.0,,"The temple is very beautiful. The staff who work in the temple, they cannot speak English anymore, but they have some sign in English to help you."
,,Allow plenty of time,4.0,,This is a really beautiful temple. We expected to spend 10 minutes there and were surprised at how much there is to see. There was something interesting at every turn.
,,Don't Miss,5.0,,It was pouring down rain but we headed to Chinatown anyway and wanted to hit this place and were not disappointed. Very impressive and don't miss the museum up stairs.
,,Visited in May2019,4.0,,This temple is s must see! History of Buddha; museum at the top; 3 floors of things to see and learn about Buddha; markets of souvenirs outside the temple.
,,An interesting Temple,4.0,,"My two daughters and I visited this very interesting temple which is in Chinatown. Yes, there is construction going on nearby but once you are inside the temple you forget about it, We even saw a lot of monks in their saffron robes which added interest to our visit."
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"This temple is a hidden gem in Chinatown of Singapore. Whether a believer in Buddhism or a non believer, the temple transports you into a serene world filled with soothing sights of various intricate designs, lights and the aroma of the incense sicks brings over calmness to anyone who enters here.

The ground level hosts the temple with thousands of Buddha idols, whereas the main attraction is the ""supposed to be"" one of the tooth of Buddha housed in a golden casket in the 4th floor."
,,Amazing place to spend an hour,5.0,,This temple is in China town. It is very well maintained with amazing interiors. You can offer prayer.
,,Huge building - very ornate,4.0,,"Entrance is free and scarfs are available for ladies to cover shoulders. It's very peaceful inside and interesting for all.

There are 4 floors - also go to the roof garden where there is a spinni g prayer wheel.

Very ornate inside with spaces for meditation."
,,Ensure you allow enough time for your visit,5.0,,We once again visted this amazing free atttraction in Singapore which is close to Maxwell's food court so you can go for something to eat or drink afterwards at a venue close by. Each level reveals a wealth of information and beautiful items to see and the rooftop garden is so peaceful for a time of quiet contemplation. It took us almost two hours to have a good look around the museum atrefacts and read about them. The wax replicas of the monks were amazing. The stupa that houses the tooth relic is so beautiful and the gold glimmers!
,,A lovely temple,4.0,,"This is on the corner of Chinatown and definitely worth a visit , as noted in previous review its in a area with construction so the setting may not be the best !!
That said once inside its very impressive and take in the wonderful smell of all the incense burning away"
,,Loved it!,4.0,,"I love tempels like this, I love the smell of the incense, the chants they are singing, .. There was one thing my friends and I thought was strange: that tooth is HUGE!!! :-)))"
,,Not as impressive as it looks,3.0,,"From the exterior it looks impressive, however it is built on a junction that is utterly ugly-there is some construction sites just in front and it's always dirty and noisy there and a lot of traffic just in front of the temple, it kind of ruins the beauty of the temple. Inside there isn't much to see/do, so you can just see around a bit and watch the praying session of the Buddhist monks and go. We stayed 6-7 minutes maximum and left quite disappointed."
,,A nice temple,5.0,,During our stopover to Australia we went to this temple. There was a service going on and it was very nice to see this. We enjoyed it very much.
,,Probably the best part of Chinatown,5.0,,"I was underwhelmed by this Chinatown until I visited this temple (and the Mariamman). At the time of my visit, there was a ceremony and it was quite interesting to see a living temple rather than just a ""tourist"" site. Very colorful. I could have used a guide to explain it."
,,Don't be put off by the name of this Temple,5.0,,Glad we went. Buddhist Museum on the 3rd floor I think is very interesting with nicely written information. The tooth relic is on 4th floor and there's a rooftop garden on 5th. Shawls are available for females to cover their shoulders
,,👍,4.0,,This is a great temple with a good museum. The actual building is 3 stores and realtors stands proud on the side of Chinatown I actually visited on my 1st and 3rd day to take it all in as there is s lot to see
,,A fairly modern temple in Chinatown,3.0,,"If you are in the area, it is worth walking through the area and admire the decorations and all they've done with this fairly new temple. Not worth a special visit though."
,,Interesting and informative. Didn't see the tooth.,4.0,,"Although busy with tourists the temple was peaceful, the building is great to look at and the interior lovely too. We visited in the afternoon, there wasn't anything organised going on but lots of people making their private devotions. There was a lot of really useful information (in English) about the temple and about Buddhist beliefs, which really enlightened the visit, (ooops no pun intended). we only did the temple on the ground floor, if I get back to Singapore I'll go back and do the rest."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit when you are in Singapore. Incredibly colorful with many local people and monks praying and chanting. Light incense and place your hands on the rose quartz stone
,,Peaceful oasis among the bustle,5.0,,Take some time to enjoy the peace and quiet of this beautiful temple filled with art and historic items. No photography allowed.
,,A must visit place if your planning to be in China Town,5.0,,Amazingly calm temple in the middle of a busy trade centre. The entrance is free. A lot of Buddha statues.
,,Fantastic and must visit place,5.0,,"With no fee to enter the main ground floor section of the temple this is a great place to visit while in the area. The level of ornateness is incredible against the surrounding buildings and everything both inside and outside is labelled well, explaining the history and significance of the place. Seeing and hearing the masses of people chanting as soon as you enter is an experience in itself and that’s before you start admiring the adorned walls.

Everyone is naturally friendly and there’s no pressure to take up any tours, give donations or buy souvenirs, which makes it even more welcoming. This ended up being one of my favourite cultural experiences in the city so I’d highly recommend you visit."
,,NIce to see,4.0,,"It's definitely hard to miss this giant temple in Chinatown. Free and easy to access (just no open drinks and food while walking through).
In the morning they have their service going on so you can watch from the sidelines if you want to. They also have coverings/shawls for you to cover up with if you aren't wearing long sleeves and long pants so that you can enter.
You can light an incense stick and pray at both entrances of the temple.
Random find, there's an ice cream claw machine on the side of the temple if you're feeling sweets.
And it's also right across the street from Maxwell food center!"
,,A visit worth in China town,4.0,,"One of the places to visit in Chinatown, and impressive temple, with an important relic. Remember to visit high floors, for example 4th floor to see the tooth."
,,Too good to miss,5.0,,"Visting south-east Asia you get 'over-templed' and it's tempting to skip some. You'll be missing out if you pass up the opportunity to visit Buddha Tooth.

It's a huge temple in central Singapore and it buzzes with activity.

We saw a full 'service' in progress and felt the spirituality of the participants. They were not put off by having visitors; I felt they were happy to display their devotions to us. In a way, the visitors became part of it.

Well worth a visit."
,,Beautiful Buddha,5.0,,"If visiting China town, do make it a point to visit this place. Interesting and vibrant architecture and a very soothing Buddha statue."
,,Bright and vibrant,4.0,,I didn't go inside the temple since I was in a hurry but the exterior's bright colors and well maintained design made for great pictures.
,,very peaceful,4.0,,There are a few different levels to see. Make sure you go to the rooftop garden. You need to cover up your legs & arms if you are wearing singlets or shorts. They do supply sarongs & wraps if needed at the door.
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,On the edge of China town it is a must go. So beautiful inside and serene although can be crowded at times with worshippers and tourists alike. Photos allowed.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,This temple is on the edge of Chinatown and well worth a visit. Inside it is cool and calm and a nice contrast with the heat and noise outside. It's very impressive and should definitely be on your list of things to see.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,I didn’t get the sense from reading reviews that this would be a placenta to visit. It was so beautiful. People here we’re extremely informative. Beautiful exhibit.
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"This is a beautiful temple, there are a few floors to visit so make sure you have enough time to visit them all. Also, if you're wearing a tank-top and shorts they'll ask you to cover with a shaw and long skirt. If I wasn't so hot outside I would have worn more appreciate clothing, but it was like 85. It's free to visit, but there are donations boxes around."
,,Stunning temple,5.0,,"Beautiful temple full of gold decorations, including hundreds of golden Buddhas. If you're lucky, you may see a ceremony. Well worth a stop."
,,Buddhist Temple,5.0,,Magnific Buudhist Temple is in Chinatown. The Temple of Hundred Buddha. There are hundred of different Buddha statues. Temple is open for visitors just respect the believers. In case if you close not appropriate you will be offered a special covers.
,,A Learning Buddhist Monastery,5.0,,"You will see amazing Budhha's body Relics, and different forms of Budhha sitting royally in the Temple"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Peaceful temple on the edge of Chinatown. Use the lift to see the history of the temple and read the story about Buddha, the top floor has a huge prayer wheel and garden area."
,,My first Chinese Buddhist temple ❤️,5.0,,"Exquisite ❤️ really! If you happen to visit this place, be sure to cover all the five floors. On our first day, we just visited the ground floor of the temple and left it at that. It was only on our second day at Chinatown Singapore that we explored more of it. There are five floors to this wonderful temple - each more beautiful than the last. On the ground floor, you will find the prayer hall with thousands of mini Buddha statues. On the higher level floors you will find more statues from all over the world each having a different significance. On the fourth floor is the infamous tooth of Buddha. It is kept inside a glass chamber and photography isn’t allowed at this floor. On the topmost floor, you will find the roof gardens surrounding the bell. We spent a leisurely one and a half hours here - soaking in as much serenity as possible. Came out with positive vibes - totally refreshed mind and soul. It is a lovely place to visit surely ❤️"
,,Beautiful Temple in Chinatown,4.0,,Really nice temple in Chinatown area. Not too many people and it’s fairly new. Would recommend for any visitor.
,,amazing building,4.0,,"very interesting to se, but a pitty that they insist everywhere to make a donation. the inside is really beautifull to see"
,,Lots of glitz.,3.0,,"The temple itself is unremarkable but the interior is a riot of gold. On the 4th floor the actual tooth relic is housed in a solid gold stupa in its own very ornate room behind glass where photography is forbidden. There is also an interesting garden on the floor above which contains an enormous prayer wheel inside a 10,000 minute buddhas pavilion. Worth a visit and always very busy with the devoted followers."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The museum inside is beautifully laid out and gives the story of Buddha. Although a new building, it is lovely and interesting. Plan on an hour. Surrounded by Chinese kiosks and eateries."
,,Worth seeing atleast if youre in the area,3.0,,"I popped in with a mate, its pretty kool to see but also pretty boring and had a weird vibe to it that didnt feel right to me, its pretty peaceful, if you walk in with a tanktop they make you cover up with a blanket of somesort, didnt spend to long here as its a place thats meant to be peaceful and it was peaceful but i found it too distracting"
,,A Peaceful Spot,5.0,,We visited this Temple and Museum as part of our trip to China Town. It is very beautiful inside and out. Scarfs and wrap over skirts are provided for under-dressed tourists.
,,Well worth a visit.,4.0,,"The temple is an active place of worship for the Buddhist community, and when we were there, there were a lot of worshippers, as well as monks in their red and saffron robes.
The tooth apparently is in the large golden Buddha at the centre of the altar."
,,MUST VISIT TEMPLE.,5.0,,this amazing temple is easily accessible and is worth visiting. The Buddha statues are just too beautiful. The tooth relic on the top floor is so well displayed and preserved in a serene environment that one can feel the spiritual energy emanating from that floor. Highly recommend.
,,A Treasure surrounded by Treasure,5.0,,At this beautiful serene Temple we witnessed Monks at prayer and visited the 4th floor meditation area where the actual Buddha Tooth is located - a must see. This golden room is a very sacred site - our guide David was informative and inspiring.
,,Buddha tooth reluc temple,5.0,,The buddha tooth relic room on the top floor is not to be missed as it is all.wrapped in solid gold n surrounded by hundreds of buddha.
,,Beautiful inside and out,5.0,,"Just happened to be walking round this area when we saw this beautiful temple so went inside. I had a dress on so was offered a shawl and sarong to wrap around my waist to cover my legs. Beautifully decorated inside and has a calming effect on you. We only saw the level we walked in to, didn't know about the rest of the levels so next time I go back to Singapore I will be going again to see it all. After reading the reviews I am really sorry we didn't know about the other floors and also about taking photos inside. I presumed you couldn't take photos but have read that you can. Definitely a must see."
,,Magnificent Temple & Museum,5.0,,"Built from ground up based on a bestowed Buddha Tooth relic, it rose to prominence in Chinatown, dwarfing the shophouses around it while it glows magnificently especially in the evening.Interesting place to visit to understand more about Buddha and see the many relics up close. Do respect the customs though and do not touch the relics. Air conditioned environment allow a welcome relief from the heat outside. Free entrance. Worth visiting if you are in Chinatown!"
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,"Loved this colourful, buzzing, amazing place. When I was there, it was full of people chanting and I found it mesmerising."
,,Must see in china town.,4.0,,It is a place that you must see if you are in china town. Go up to the roof top garden and enjoy quietness and calmness. The museum part is also nice to see. Wish the Buddha's tooth was bit closer to see.
,,A must visit temple in Chinatown,4.0,,"Beautifully done in red hues, the Buddha Tooth Relic temple is a must visit if in the Chinatown area. Never crowded, even during the ceremony time, I was enamoured by the gentle chanting, the facility provided by the temple of lending sarongs and scarves free of cost so that nobody is turned away for inappropriate dressing, the air conditioned respite from the outside sun and mostly the beautiful interiors, embroidered tapestries and large deity. The Hall of a Hundred Buddhas allows for photography if there is no prayer service going on. There is a museum above and the much revered tooth relic displayed there. The exit at the back opens into a nice square, with local food and coffee shops. Entry is free and I would highly recommend a visit here."
,,Must see in Chinatown,5.0,,Would recommend this place even as a short respite from the heat as it is air conditioned. There is a structured route around the first level of the place.
,,A must visit,5.0,,What a wonderful place to visit it is marvelous inside the atmosphere is unbelievable and warming make sure you go to the top floor to see the buddha.

,,House Of Buddha's Tooth,2.0,,This is a new Buddhist Temple opened in 2007 and has a museum that houses what is claimed to be a tooth relic of Buddha found in a collapsed building in Myanmar in 1980. Not being big on old teeth or understanding the significance of the relic I went for the architecture which was just OK and Tang Dynasty Style so I was advised. It is one of a number of interesting places for tourists on South Bridge Road in Chinatown.
,,meh,2.0,,"sure I'm not a buddhist so maybe I don't have the appreciation, but this was no comparison to all the 'real' temples I saw in Bangkok. Went in, walked to the top, saw all the shiny gold stuff and left."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Plan to spend an hour or so here so you can go to all the levels and really see this amazing place; it is breathe taking.

After you finish your tour, right behind the temple on the second floor (left hand back corner) is the famous 1 star Michelle Hacker ""Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice And Noodle"". Great stop before you head to your next adventure."
,,Newish feeling Temple,4.0,,"Very clean multi level temple. Pretty and worth the visit. Gives a good brief history of Buddhism and this temple's relevance. Visit early when visiting the rest of Chinatown. Recommend spending about an hour visiting each floor. Ladies, be prepared to cover your legs."
,,Worth a quick visit,4.0,,"It’s free to go. It is actually a pretty new building, as opposed to an ancient temple. It is free to walk in and look around. In all honesty, you won’t spend more than 10 minutes there, but Ms,r it a part of doing Chinatown."
,,Looks incredible from outside,3.0,,"If you arrive by MRT, head for Pagoda street exit and you arrive at chinatown, walk through stalls to end and turn right, Indian temple is 5 metres away and this temple is a five minute walk on the same side of the road. Easy to get to."
,,Beautiful when you see from far,4.0,,"It large inside, but I can not go further so I just stay here foo only 10 min. Bus to here is convenience"
,,Strange but good,4.0,,"What an odd thing to learn about, very good experience to find out about something you never knew about. I would go back to learn more."
,,More to see than just a tooth,4.0,,"We stopped by the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple expecting to breeze through an ornate hall, and then move on. Turns out, there's more to see at this multi-story temple!
There *is* an ornate hall, and it was full of people when we arrived so we didn't crowd in. If we wanted to though, there were scarves and wrap-skirts to cover up in case you're an insensitive jerk who doesn't know how to dress at a temple.
Then we took the elevator (YES the elevator) to the 4th floor to where the tooth-viewing room is (no dress code necessary). The room is ornate, and English plaques explain the temple and the tooth relic on display behind glass in a golden pagoda.
Then we went up the stairs to the rooftop garden, where you can spin a giant prayer wheel and enjoy the benches and the plants.
We took the stairs on the way down, and we should have taken the elevator because we came out on to the street instead of back in the main room where we started.

If you found this review helpful, give it a thumbs up!"
,,Heritage temple,5.0,,"This building is so great and nice, the location is near from chinatown area, you can go there by walk from pagoda street."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Lovely temple located close to Chinatown. Definitely worth a visit. We visited Chinatown first then walked to the temple. From the temple it’s then just a short walk to Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre.
,,Amazing temple that worst the visit from the bottom to top floors,5.0,,It’s a very nice temple located near Chinatown market You can visit it from on different floors You can also attend some events
,,"Despite the crowds, a place of beauty and devotion",4.0,,New to me in Singapore. The ground floor level is open without any restrictions. Very tastefully done. Worth a visit and worth taking a quiet pause.
,,Lots of bling,4.0,,Just a short stroll into Chinatown and this gem is to be found . Its always busy so allow a little extra time to go at a slower pace if you are a 'look at it all 'type person.
,,Worth Visiting While in Chinatown,5.0,,"We did not know what to expect when we stopped in here at the ended of our visit to the Chinatown Market. The building is only about 12 years old even though it looks older. Inside we saw many golden Buddha's with one large on at the alter area. Many monks were quietly praying while we respectfully walked thru. There are additional floors to visit upstairs.

BOTTOM LINE: I would not call this a ""must see"" attraction but it is interesting to see and stroll trhough. I suggest you treat this temple as you would any holy place and wear modest clothing or shawl and remove your hat. Walk thru respectfully. Worth your visit when is the Chinatown Market area. MY RATING: 8/10"
,,"Wow, fascinating!",4.0,,"We were totally clueless as to what to expect but were intrigued by the picture in the guidebook!
What a place - we entered and looked around in amazement - each level of the temple showed something different, although we were not totally sure what we were looking at some of the time.
A fascinating, beautiful place that overwhelmed us to be honest and sparked an interest in what much of it meant!"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is located in Chinatown in Singapore and was built in 2007. It houses the tooth relic of the Buddha. The relic can be viewed at the 4th floor of the temple from the public viewing area, as only monks are allowed into the relic chamber. The Buddha Tooth Relic is housed in a giant stupa that is made from 320 kilograms of gold. Beside the tooth relic of the Buddha you can visit the richly designed interiors and wide-ranging exhibits on Buddhist art and history. Some of the interesting parts of the building include the Hundred Dragons Hall, which houses a hundred Buddha statues, and the Universal Wisdom Hall, where handcrafted Bodhisattva artworks are on display. Head to the roof garden which has pagoda and Buddha prayer wheel for a tranquil hideaway.
Admission and the guided tour (2 hours) are free but donations are encouraged. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is opened Sun – Sat 7:00am - 7:00pm. Suggested duration is about an hour if doing a self-guided tour. Shoulders, back and legs should be covered to enter the temple to show respect."
,,Peace and tranquility,5.0,,"We were taken to this beautiful temple by our tour guide, and fully enjoyed the beauty, peace and tranquility in an otherwise bustling, hot and humid China Town."
,,Great Learning Experience,5.0,,"This was a recently built temple to house one of Buddha’s teeth. On the ground floor was a large altar and hundreds of Buddha statues in all sizes on each side of it. That day a large number of people were attending some formal function so we could not approach the altar.

In the back was another altar and it was more approachable. In front were a large number of offerings which included bottles of water, fruit or flowers. The water was unusual.

I then took the elevator to the top floor and climbed another set of stairs to the rooftop. I was surprised I see it filled with plants and trees. It was a beautiful garden! In the Center was a small building that housed the largest cloisonné prayer wheel in the world. It was called the Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel and inside it was a piece of scripture. I originally spun it the wrong way but a kind gentleman showed me that spinning it clockwise rang a bell after each complete turn and it helped a person with reciting the sutra.

I walked back down the stairs just as the shrine holding Buddha’s tooth opened. That was 9am which is 2 hours later than the opening time for the main temple. I had to remove my shoes before entering and they were quite strict going after people who forgot. No photos were allowed. Prayer and meditation areas were arrayed around the the glass wall that separated us from the gold plated tooth. They spared no expense in gold plating the room.

The last floor I visited contained the museum. They did a wonderful job of telling the story of Buddha through artifacts and words. Definitely spend time here if you have the time."
,,Interesting and Different,4.0,,The name Buddha tooth temple is what got our attention. It is a fairly new temple and popular with tourists. We folliwed the crowd to see the tooth.
,,Beautiful Temple and Museum,5.0,,"Not having a clue as to what to expect, we entered the Temple and were amazed at its beauty and cleanliness. We toured the ground floor for a good twenty minutes before deciding to explore upstairs. Each level offers something different, including the largest prayer wheel I have seen. One floor is set up as a typical museum with displays behind glass. The works here I found to be fascinating. There were ornate brass bells collected from all over Asia...a pair from Cambodia, a set from Thailand, and so forth. There were delicate wooden carvings colorfully painted on display. If they had not told me they were wood, I would not have known. In some cases they had the appearance of ceramic. All in all, a very interesting visit. The tooth of Buddha cannot be seen closely, but an enlarged photo of the tooth is on display. I could only guess from the several displays to choose from, which may actually be holding the tooth."
,,Thousand Buddah statues are displayed.,4.0,,Thousand buddah statues overwhelmed me. Every statue has different hands in shape. It is worth visitn there.
,,Day visit,5.0,,We had visited this temple a few years before and wanted to revisit. It’s such a beautiful temple very serene and relaxing to walk around. A place to sit and dwell.
,,Meditation,5.0,,"Living in Singapore and often visited the temple I didn't know that there is a restaurant on the 2 second floor, a garden on the top and many other things to discover. We actually had a meditation seminar. You also can buy a ""buddha"" for a year. Simply the building itself is worth a visit."
,,Great architecture,5.0,,Very nice temple. There is a shopping area inside of the Temple . Do not forget to remove your hat or cap. No need to remove your shoes.
,,holy place,3.0,,everyone is welcome to visit this holy place. try to light up an incense and pray and make a wish. it might just come true. wear modest dress and observe silence. always be respectful when visiting holy places of worship
,,Fun,5.0,,Go upstairs...elevator and stairs to top. Pretty flowers....drum thing that you walk around 3x for good luck.
,,Interesting and active temple,5.0,,When we visited the temple was relatively crowded with two musicians playing and a large mix of tourists and Buddhists in attendance. There is a lot to see
,,Modern Temple,3.0,,"So this temple is what $62 million gets you! Built in 2007 to house a supposed fragment of Buddha's tooth, this is a nice temple to visit, but given how modern it is, it quite lacks in character - very popular with tourists; free to visit but long clothes must be worn (and no shorts above knee length)."
,,A nice but new temple with ongoing prayers,4.0,,"We visited this temple during a prayer and for us, as being Orthodox, was interesting to observe the rites and rituals of the Buddhists. The temple is new, so it looks great, both architecturally and in terms of the items of adoration and worship inside."
,,One place devides by 2 different religions,3.0,,"What I found interesting about this place os that it has 2 entrances, can be passed in the middle, and it looka like the place is actually devided into 2 places with 2 different religions."
,,Solemn yet serene,5.0,,"On times if you're lucky, you will get to see ongoing prayers or rituals at the first floor. However do note that no shorts or sleeveless are allowed in this temple, so do cover up yourself with the shawl that they provide at the entrance. Don't forget to go up to to the temple, where they have an outdoor garden at the roof, and then a few small prayer rooms with the respective deities in it, and a small museum showcasing the history of Buddhism. I always bring my friends around this place whenever they visit Singapore, :)."
,,tourist attraction,4.0,,"Opposite maxwell food center, They have museum but cannot take a photo. Around there has a lot of souvenir shop."
,,Everything is VERY,3.0,,"Well, no picture is allowed, souvenir are VERY expensives and the tooth is....very very big. The are a lot of relics inside and I am not sure about the meaning as it looks like small plastic various color ball, which are supposed to represent or to be, parts of the Buddha body. Anyway, it's a nice place to visit. Just to mention, it is Chinese buddhsim."
,,Must-see-temple,5.0,,"Most interesting, beautiful temple and definitely worth a visit, even if you're not particularly religious. Right next to Chinatown."
,,"A holy place, that you could learn about Buddhism in a modern way",5.0,,"A modern Buddhist Temple, with a modern facilities.. A place to learn about Buddhism and ""The Sidharta Gautama"" A place to pray and meditation Really Amazing Place..."
,,Beautiful replication of a Tang dynasty Temple,5.0,,"This modern Buddhist temple is constructed along the lines of a Tang dynasty Buddhist temple and it is apt as Chinese Mahayana Buddhism reached a high point (if not its highest) of development during the Tang dynasty.

Visitors to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum should set aside at least 2 hours to view the various exhibits. in addition to main shrine on the ground level, visitors should go to the museum and there is a garden at the rooftop (you need to walk up a flight of stairs)."
,,Mesmerizing experience,5.0,,"From beautiful statues to sculptures they have it all here. The Buddha's tooth relic is at a higher floor. The temple also has an orchid garden. Be sure to cover up to show respect. Forgot your longs? No worries, they have free sarong and wrap around at the entrance. Some of the pathways are a bit narrow so if you go on a crowded day you might find it a bit difficult to navigate a stroller through the crowd. Take an umbrella. It can get quite sunny if you decide to walk there from the china town mrt. Peaceful experience."
,,Visited twice over the years,5.0,,Wonderful experience. Do get a dish of coins and place one in every bowl around the temple. Spend peaceful time to absorb the atmosphere. Plus - it's right there in Chinatown to get to the restaurants afterwards.
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,Having seen the temple from the bus tour we ventured back on foot. Stunning is the only way to describe it.
,,Worth a Stop on your hop On Hop Off tour,5.0,,"I took the hop On Hop Off tour as I always do but this time I took it because I was exhausted. The only thing I had the energy for was to get off and visit this Buddha Tooth Temple.

This is a magnificently maintained, and structurally awesome temple. It is also one of the most beautiful temples I have seen in all of Asia.

I went alone and just walked throughout looking at the hundreds of golden buddhas, perfectly aligned, floor to ceiling. It was mesmerizing.

Although I am of the christian faith I found it meaningful to pray and light incense for my family and friends.

God is as much in the temple as he is in a church or anywhere else."
,,Beautiful Temple In Chinatown,4.0,,"It's a beautiful temple in bustling Chinatown. Do take time to visit the different floors. Vegetarian food is available in the temple.
Do come in clothing that cover up your shoulders and avoid mini skirts or shorts.
They do have scarves to cover up if needed though."
,,Allow plenty of time to see this temple,5.0,,"If you are short of time, at least visit the main temple where you can take photos. But if you have more time, go upstairs to the museum on the next 3 or 4 levels. The museum is well laid out and has English signage. Wax figures of monks, a splendid gold room and a relic of the Buddha's tooth can all be seen. Plus from the higher levels, you get good views."
,,Must visit Temple,5.0,,If you have the time to visit only one temple in Singapore then it should be this one! Rich golden decoration inside and a nice garden on the top!
,,Must visit,5.0,,"It was wonderful experience. Serene, spiritual and having history. Beautifully depicting Bodhisatva incarnation. As it is just next to Chinatown hub, it’s very easy to commute and see. Free for all visitors. Only you need to be properly dressed."
,,"Beautiful building, lot's to learn in this Buddha Temple and Museum",5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful building, rich decoration inside, a lot to learn and see. We did particularly like the 100 buddhas and learn about the different hand signs sympolizing virtues and powers. Absolutely recommended to go. Also very nice area around to stay and have an authentic meal."
,,Buddha's Blessings,4.0,,Nice temple with very ornate prayer areas. There is also a restaurant and a museum on the upper levels. Whether you are Bhuddist or not this is a must see when you are in Singapore. It is located in Chinatown and you can combine a visit to both which takes about half a day.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Enjoyed every minute from the splendour of the architecture outside, to the soul soothing experience inside."
,,A truly calming visit,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a Buddhist temple and museum complex located in the Chinatown. It is incredibly beautiful and exudes calm. Remember to cover shoulders before entering (scarves available to borrow by entrance). Free to enter. Please leave a donation if you can. I left feeling refreshed and calm. The visit can be brief, but I felt I could stay as long as I wished, and confess to wishing I'd stayed longer."
,,In the centre of Chinatown,5.0,,"This s a relatively new temple complex, it opened in 2007 but the style is ancient.

There are multiple levels and even a rooftop courtyard but the temple itself is on the ground floor.

Visitors are very welcome and entry is free of charge, although you can make a donation if you wish.

The design is very unusual as it has two entrances or “fronts”, one off Neil Road snd the other from Kiera Ayer.

The temple itself is stunning and well worth a visit.

We visited during Chinese New Year and were treated to a line dance while we were there."
,,Good Place,4.0,,Very holy & Positive vibes. Its nearby to china town street. Good place to visit. I like this one for one of the oldest buddha temple. .
,,Good for Beginners,4.0,,"Want to learn a little more about Buddhism but don't know where to start? I think visiting this temple is a good start. Not only there are so many levels, it is also air-conditioned. What's more, it is well maintained and the temple is so beautiful. It's a great sight seeing spot and place for great photos. Personally I love the level where they display the tooth relic as there is a meditation corner. I love that and would probably be back for that meditation corner."
,,Possibly the best temple in Singapore,4.0,,Don't miss this one - it's tucked away at the bottom end of China town but highly worthy of a visit. Beautiful carvings and decorations
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I always find visiting places of worship interesting but also a little awkward as I never wish to intrude on the privacy of others and tier faith. We were very welcome even though the people were at prayer. I found an attendant willing to answer my questions and i found this illuminating. The Temple is not old, in fact quite new. There are a number of levels and we found it well worth going up to the roof courtyard and viewing the prayer wheel. There are museums on some levels and the relic tooth in its special sanctuary. The areas where visitors may go are well marked as are the areas where footwear should be removed; there are racks provided to house footwear. I found it assisted my understanding of Buddhism and that is always a good thing."
,,Fascinating,4.0,,This is well worth a visit whilst in Chinatown. Apart from seeing the Buddha Tooth you should also make a visit to the rooftop garden.
,,Cover yourself,4.0,,"If you entering this place - no skin showing please.
They have public scarfs you can use to cover your shoulder and thighs but if your too picky then dress properly.
See the Buddha that depicts your date of Birth and see the million dollar relic house in gold."
,,Spiritual,5.0,,"It put shivers down our spines listening to the soothing chants of the monks at the temple. This is beautiful and deeply spiritual place- if you are a lady with no sleeves or short skirts, you will be asked to cover up."
,,OH MEE TOE FOE,5.0,,"Hey, check out this grand old dame of a temple. You can experience Buddha's birthday here with you cousin or great grandma."
,,A must do,5.0,,"Great place to visit, really interesting small muesium, lovely rooftop garder to spend a quite moment to reflect on your visit. The tooth displayed in awesome surroundings that make you feel you are truly in a special place. Highly recommend"
,,Absolutely stunning temple,5.0,,"Wonderful temple, a real treasure to witness and to walk around. Definitely worth a visit, it’s simply stunning!"
,,One of the most beautiful temples !!!!,5.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is located at China town in Singapore and is probably one of the most beautiful ones I have seen anywhere in the world. The temple is based on the Chinese Tang dynasty architectural style. It was primarily built to house the tooth relic of Lord Buddha. The ground breaking ceremony was conducted on 13 March 2005. The temple construction cost more than S$60 million and over 2 years to complete. There is a belief that the relic of Buddha from which it gains its name was found in 1980 in a collapsed stupa in Myanmar. The relic can be viewed by the public at the 4th floor of the temple.

It is one of the most famous attraction within Chinatown for tourists. The interiors are beautiful and is strongly recommended that you keep about 2 hours to see the temple properly. They also have a museum on 3rd floor."
,,Incense galore.,5.0,,Crowded temple with tourists and locals. Incense was heavily used by the many local worshipers. The building was quite large and very nicely decorated with Buddhist figures.
,,Impressive Buddhist Temple,5.0,,Must see if you are into religious buildings. Impressive list of Buddhas and the size of the building is impressive for a small country like Singapore where land is limited.
,,Magnificent Buddhist temple,5.0,,"This isn’t a typical Buddhist temple. It is larger and much more grand than most. The exterior wooden architecture of the four-story building is amazingly beautiful, as is the prayer hall. This is a place of enlightenment, serenity, peace, and calmness."
,,Lovely temple,5.0,,I was stunned after seeing the beauty of the temple. Try to visit each fllor. There is free vegetarian lunch available from 9 am to 3 pm
,,Buddha temple.,5.0,,Very attractive temple in the middle of Singapore. beautiful architecture . lots of different posture of lord Buddha.
,,The Best Mahayana Temple in Southeast Asia,5.0,,"I am not a great fan of Singapore’s Chinatown. However, the Buddha Tooth Temple IS impressive. It’s the best Mahayana Buddhist temple I’ve seen in Southeast Asia (its closest competitor, in Medan, is huge, but modern architecture). Although less than 50 years old, this temple can bear comparison with many of the historic temples you see in China itself. The architecture is based on northern Chinese temple architecture of the Tang Dynasty (1300 years ago, and chiefly known in the West for colourful Tang ceramic horses and camels, and the infamous Empress Wu).

The building’s huge exterior may be the #1 photo-op in Chinatown: it’s only competition is the temple interior (See Temple Facade photo). The main hall is dominated by a stunning golden Maitreya, flanked by two golden Bodhisattvas. A Maitreya is a “future Buddha” who is to re-enlighten the world during a dark age when mankind has lost all sense of dharma. Bodhisattvas are holy men or women who have attained extremely high levels of dharma, and are on the cusp of total enlightenment themselves, but refrain, in order to instruct and raise up humanity. Historically, numerous rebellions have swept over China in which the rebels stirred up support by claiming that a dark age was upon us, and the Maitreya was about to come. Taoists were welcome to participate on grounds that the current emperor had lost the mandate of Heaven. The concept is not entirely unlike extreme millennialism in Christianity, and the catastrophic Taiping rebellion actually combined all three religions. Blaming any of the three religions on the carnage is unfair (see Maitreya and Boddhisatvas photo, and Maitreya Closeup photos).

A gentler side of Buddhism can be seen on the opposite, northwestern half of the ground floor, where a multi-armed compassionate deity with beautiful pastel colours is flanked by guardian Tang Dynasty warriors. For lack of positive identification, I’ll call the god Avalokiteśvara (see Compassionate Deity photo). But it might be the Chinese goddess of Mercy, Guan Yin. My Buddhist Thai partner thinks the statue is of “Phra Kuan Im”: i.e. Princess Guan Yin. Could be either. They both often have multiple arms, allowing them to reach out in half a dozen different directions to assist people who pray for help; vastly increasing the number and scope of their benevolent responses. (Kyoto has a temple with 1,001 thousand-armed Kannons—Guan Yins—which works out to 1,001,000 compassionate interventions!)

With better timing, Nok and I could have easily determined who the multi-armed deity was. We were doing a two-week whistle-stop tour of four SE Asian countries with American friends who’d never been to the Far East. Due to that schedule, we weren’t in Singapore on a Saturday. If you WILL be in Singapore on a Saturday, you can join a free two-hour English-language guided tour of the complete complex. You have to apply in advance to the temple, on-line. If you’re unfamiliar with Buddhism, I recommend you try to get into one of these free tours. And if you do, please do me a favour: ask your guide which benevolent deity this one actually is, and mention that in your TA review!

Definitely go upstairs as well. There are two museums aloft, and one relic chamber. The more interesting museum to me (and probably to you) is the Buddhist Culture Museum, which holds Buddhist artifacts from throughout Asia. Their collection of these artifacts is not as good as that of the Museum of Asian Art in San Francisco, where Asian history and culture are traced for 2500 years via Buddhist statues and images. But there’s a huge difference: in SF’s MAA, the curators and most visitors take a decidedly secular perspective of these statues—just as folks seeing the Venus de Milo don’t actually worship Greek goddesses. Here, the BCM’s emphasis is very much on the religious meaning and significance of the pieces in their collection.

The other museum tells the history of the construction of the temple itself. I understand why Singaporeans might find this interesting, just as New Yorkers might find details of the Brooklyn Bridge’s construction interesting, but I’d recommend giving it five minutes at most.

Finally, there’s the relic chamber. The most important relic here is a tooth of the Buddha. Many major Buddhist sites contain relic hairs from the Buddha, but there are far fewer teeth, so tooth relics are much rarer. This one is said to have been recovered from a ruined chedi in Burma, which I don’t doubt, but I am astonished that they got it out of the country. Such a relic, which radiates spiritual energy, would normally ensure that the holy site was rebuilt, and the Burmese go to great pains to do this at many chedis (I’ve reviewed at least half dozen of them for TA). Note that while the Buddha Tooth Temple itself is open from 0700 to 1900, the BCM and relic chamber are only open from 0900 to 1800.

Let me mention three behavioral policies here:

First, non-flash-photos are permitted in some places, but not in the relic chamber. Flash photos are strictly prohibited, as they should be, considering the damage they can do.

Second, shoes are permitted. Oddly enough, wearing shoes has been perfectly OK at every Mahayana temple I’ve ever visited in China, Japan and Tibet, but is strictly prohibited at every Theravada temple I’ve ever been to in Southeast Asia (as well as Hindu temples, Sikh gurdwaras and Moslem mosques). I suspect this has to do with the winter climate in Mahayana lands.

Third, dress appropriately for a place of worship! For men: no shorts or tank-tops. For women: conservative dress or slacks, with shoulders covered. I’ve railed about this in more than one TA review: my rogues’ gallery favourites are (#2) the drop-dead gorgeous Chinese lass in a miniskirt and spike heels, walking right past a multi-language dress code sign into a venerable wat in Chiang Mai, and (#1) the very busty Western lass jogging bra-less in a super-skimpy running outfit through a rigorous retreat in rural Thailand where young Buddhist monks are sent to spend months in speechless solitude, silently concentrating on nothing but the dharma arts and—oh yes—that hot babe that just ran past my hut, totally ruining eight weeks of meditation!

One last tip: as one of many examples of Singapore’s multi-culturalism, the Buddha Tooth Temple is literally one long block away from the most historic Hindu temple in Singapore, Sri Mariamman. I recommend seeing them both, one right after the other in either order. (There’s also a mosque right past Sri Mariamman, but the must-see one in Singapore is the Sultan Mosque over in Kampong Glam.)"

It is much like visiting many other traditional Buddha temples but also has fascinating exhibitions on some of the levels.

I was surprised to learn that it was built in 2007, yet contains the history of a culture and religion dating over centuries. The Tooth Relic is housed in a 3.5t stupa of which 320kg is gold. Visitors can only view from the public area. Many worshippers were present and the building was filled with the heady smell of incense sticks and candles. Various small ceremonies and blessings were being conducted by the monks and it was almost mesmerising to listen to the sonorous chanting. Free entry but a donation welcome. 2 hour guided tours available if you have the time, and we intend to take the tour when next in Singapore."
,,A short visit to the temple,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was a very moving experience. Anyone from any culture was embraced and invited to make offering to Buddha and to pray.

The rooms in the temple take your break away, and you have plenty of God's to choose to whom you want to pray with

But truly a revelation and it's free to go in"

The temple gets its name from what the Buddhists regard as the left canine tooth of Buddha."
,,Amazing site,5.0,,"We decided to visit the site prior to our holiday thinking a quick look was enough. We were amazed upon arrival. The ground floor level was fantastic.

,,Beautiful Temple Near Chinatown,5.0,,"Visiting this temple at 03.00 PM, just before going to Chinatown food street. My first impression was amazing when seeing a lot of Buddha statue on wall, beautiful ornament on ceiling, very artistic place and really bring peace on mind. The Buddha Relic on 4th floor, no special dress code requirement but women must wearing brown fabric (they called it Sarong) to cover up knees and shoulder (they provide it). Admission fee was free, but open for donation (You can buy a gold plated coin to make donation). Inside temple also selling souvenir like bracelet, necklace, earrings, etc. Museum close at 06.00 PM for stupa chamber, so better visiting it on afternoon so you can explore all places on this temple."
,,Must visit,5.0,,I was able to see the prayers at close quarters.the museum upstairs is really good.gave us so much information on Buddhism.there is one of the biggest prayer wheel at the topmost floor.the place is really serene.we can spend time meditating there and come out refreshed.we really loved it

,,An exquisite experience,5.0,,"The temple is fantastic. The decor is beyond expression. It is not housed as a temple, it also a museum for visitors to understand the history of Buddhism."
,,Beautiful place recommend doing Buddhism course,5.0,,"Since moving to Singapore I've visited this temple regularly. I just love it! It's not only great to walk around the temple amazed by all its beauty. But the atmosphere is really great too. It can be busy at times since it's on of the most popular temples. The museum is very informative. Don't forget to visit the rooftop.
For those starting their Asia travels in Singapore I highly recommend doing the introduction to Buddhism course. Half or full day. As I love visiting temples this course really helped me understanding more about Buddhism in general and certain rituals. Too many mistakes are made cause visitors don't know the exact etiquette. They also have workshops in different types of meditation. I can also recommend the food in the basement of the temple. Good quality vegetarian food. You will get a large plate for a low price."
,,Pretty cool,3.0,,I only stopped at this place but it's very beautiful and I wish I was their longer also the gold and red furnishing look cool

,,Most Beautiful Golden Buddhist Temple with a Hidden Roof Top Garden,5.0,,"Did you know this temple is the most expensive Buddhist temple in the world?? If you only walk around on the first floor, you'd see all the big Buddha statue and all the golden colors everywhere; if you walk around the second floor, you may be creeped out by the wax figures (I was!) and impressed by all the offerings (those Jade Buddhas). But seriously, you are missing out if you don't got check out the roof top garden and the biggest Praying Wheel in the world. Most people don't know about the roof top garden so it's quiet and relaxing up there. Also, don't miss the Buddha's Teeth Relic on the 4th floor (after all it's what's the temple is named after).

Tip:
1) Take the elevator to the 4th floor, then take the stairs to the roof top (you'll see the signs)"

An added bonus was that the monks were participating in their afternoon prayers with a number of local worshippers. Fascinating and very moving.
,,Mixed feelings,3.0,,"I really had mixed feelings about this place. Whilst I completely respect the temple and the religion I wasn’t overwhelmed. Sorry! This was for a number of reasons. Firstly I think all of the other temples that I have visited have been rambling affairs that feel loved and treasured and have felt part of the community around. This temple felt instead as if it were landed and didn’t belong. Might not have helped by the building site close by. There were also too many tourists who just walked (no, raced) through taking snaps, paying little attention to what the temple represents. At the end of the day I just didn’t feel awed."
,,Absolutely beautiful Buddhist temple!,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful Buddhist temple! The roof has a garden so don't miss that. The actual tooth relic is fascinating. Modest dress is required, but there are covers at the door. The temple is gorgeous and a fascinating stop!"

As I have never been into a Buddhist temple before, I was amazed at its size and grandeur.

,,Sacred atmosphere in a busy city,5.0,,"Opposite to the busy streets outside, the atmostphere inside the temple is holy when everyone respects and keeps silent. I saw some people were meditating, they looked so peaceful.

,,Holy Temple,4.0,,Take note that you couldn’t enter if shoulders are exposed. I didn’t read the rules and just entered. I was approached by the man in charge. It was a bit embarassing but then it’s my fault. It’s important that those rules be observed by tourists. It is a holy buddhist temple and therefore we must respect their beliefs and traditions.
,,Memorable experince,5.0,,"We visited Buddha temple during thier service or worship or how it is called. I have never seen something like this before. Although I am atheist I had goosebumps...

This is something you must see in Singapore."

You will not regret it. It is one of the holiest Buddhist temples in Singapore with a great hall for ceremonies and a museum with a great collection of artifacts as well as a great collection of wax statues of the main Buddhist high priests for many decades. Of course the main attraction here is obviously the Buddha Tooth Relic and you can find it in the magnificent golden hall in the upper floor.

,,My place to meditate,5.0,,"When I feel like meditating, I go to this place. The ambience is very nice and they provide areas where you can sit and meditate, there is also a small garden at the top, so dont miss that too. The way to it is pretty crowded though."
,,Good architecture but lacking the cultural experience,3.0,,"Easy to spot, big beautiful and well maintained building.

,,Beautiful Temple and wonderful to see,5.0,,The beauty of this temple is something to behold and it is wonderful to see so many worshipers. Don't forget to go upstairs as the tooth relic room is amazing and the roof garden is beautiful.
,,On the Heart of China Town,3.0,,"Located at the center of China Town, this is a must-visit temple while on Singapore. Reasons:
First, it is located at China Town. (Meaning you can bargain cheap souvenirs, and eat authentic Chinese food since you're already within the area).
Second, you can immerse yourself inti their culture, and learn some of their practices.
Finally, it is one of the attractions in China Town.

Things to bring/do/wear while inside the said temple:
●As far as I remember, pointed objects i.e. umbrellas, and the like are not around inside the temple.
●Picture taking is prohibited while an on-going feast/mass is being held.
●Wear dress, or long skirts, or pants if ever you plan in visiting the said place. Although, you can borrow a sarong (provided by them) which you can find before entering the said place.
●Follow their rules for a hassle-free visit.

During the time we visited the said Temple, an on-going mass/feast is being held. I must say that it was really amazing how focus all the attendees gathered during that time. You will see high respect for their Buddha."

,,The chanting/singing was interesting,4.0,,"I did not get to see the tooth but liked hearing the monks chant and sing on the first floor right inside the entrance. I have seen Buddhist monks praying in Japan and Thailand, and I found this Chinese style to be very interesting."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Bright, colourful and thought provoking. If not dressed suitably scarves are available at the door. We spent a few hours wandering through, reading most of the info, learning and watching blessings and other ceremonial activities. Donation boxes available in lieu of entry fees.

Loved it and will visit again."
,,Impressive architecture and that is all.,2.0,,"Allow 5 mins at this attraction. Dress light, take an umbrella, a bottle of water and at least SGD$40. Cash. Singapore is hot and wet at times, and the cash you will need for lunch and souvenirs, and an ice cream sandwich if you find him.
We found this Temple mostly over rated. It is an impressive building architecturally speaking, but there were so many people, we struggled to get inside, then we really saw nothing from the inside that we couldn’t have seen from the front door. Forget about using their filthy toilet at the top of the stairs, with a line of people to the ground floor.
My tip is just walk past it and poke your head inside the front door (for free) on your way to China town. The Maxwell Hawker centre next door on Maxwell rd, is well worth a visit for a meal while you are there."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,This temple is so very impressive. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. The statues are gorgeous and huge.
,,Buddha,4.0,,Well i'm not sure where to start but i could said The Buddha was the most amazing architech design i've ever seen

,,Stunning shrine!,5.0,,"This is a culturally significant and stunning temple in the heart of Singapore, very close to China town food street and the Maxwell food centre (5 minute walk from Chinatown MRT).

,,"Beautiful temple and the monks were singing, it was amazing to see",5.0,,"I would visit this temple, one thing to remember is the culture inside is very modest. I had a hat on and my shorts needed to be covered. They give you a sarong to cover your legs and you just need to remove your hat, it was no issue to me and they were very kind about telling me it is best to cover up. I respect the people and of course did so and enjoyed the beauty inside. I also have a photo of myself outside. There are gorgeous statues of lions ""guarding"" the building. A must see for the cultural part of your trip!"

Have respect and appreciate it without your cameras/phones and/or talking. You need proper clothing. Man and woman need pants/dress and a proper top. The monk at the door will provide scarves for coverage.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"If your one that loves Chinese temples this is stunning and a must on your list I would say it's the most beautiful temple in Singapore you must remove any hats and if wearing a singlet ensure your shoulders are covered prior to entering but once inside your going to be amazed at what you see. This is a active temple and people will most likely be inside involved in a ceremony, you can still walk around and film or take photos but respect the temple and the locals that use it."

Catching the lift to the top floor we climbed the stair to the rooftop garden which is lovely and peaceful The garden walls are covered in thousands of small Buddha statues and provides a spectacular sight. We then worked our way down floor by floor taking in all that there is on offer here. Do allow yourself plenty of time and check out all levels.
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"The temple is worth visiting but it is useful to be aware of expectations. I had a shirt on with exposed shoulders and needed to cover. Shorts above the knee are not allowed. They have sarong like shawls to assist.

The temple is multi level and it is worth taking time to explore each. Each level has different expectations (shoes on or off, women permitted/forbidden).

If you use the toilet remember to collect toilet paper on the way in."

The architecture is beautiful. Despite being a religious building, as a visitor, I felt welcome and didn't feel like I was intruding as I walked around. Photos are allowed except for at the sacred relic chamber. There are cloths provided for visitors requiring shoulders and knees to be covered before you enter.

I really enjoyed the 3th and 4th floors and roof top. On the rooftop there is a lovely little garden, a pagoda and a prayer wheel. Don't miss the 4th floor. Regardless of your religious beliefs, it's worth a visit. The Sacred Light Hall is visually beautiful. You can walk around the outer chamber, we saw a couple of people meditating along the sides. There is a large clear window through which you can see the golden inner chamber where the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic and it's golden stupa are centred. The Buddhist Cultural Museum is on level 3; I found it interesting learning about the life of Buddha."

,,Amazing Temple,5.0,,"We took 2 small children during the monks chanting and although loud it was interesting and amazing to see. Free entry and stay within a roped off lane, moving through temple to see the chanting. Interesting for all who see it."
,,Very striking,4.0,,"The temple was the starting point for any Tour East Tour. The temple itself is huge and colourful. It is quite serene in that the colours are striking but you must maintain a quiet demeanour while walking around the temple.

The huge statues and amazing colours are worth the time."
,,Religious place,5.0,,"Been here few times, go to the top floor to see the history of Buddha, and see the relics. Lots of knowledge shared here."
,,Enlightenment,5.0,,To the moving chant of the monks and the people’s prayer it was an honour to be allowed to view this most beautiful of temples. The ornate decorations of the Buddha’s throughout are captivating. Upstairs there is a museum with the history of Buddha that is most enlightening. This was a highlight of our week stay in Singapore.
,,Interesting but very touristy,3.0,,This is an attractive temple but does not seem like a place of reflection or calmness. It is quite commercialised and seems quite fake.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The architecture of this temple is absolutely stunning, a must see if visiting Singapore. It is a busy working temple"
,,Reverent and Beautiful,5.0,,"I really enjoyed this temple and museum. You do need to follow the dress code, but they offer free shawls and skirt wraps to cover your shoulders and knees. On floors 1 to 3 you can take pictures. But on the 4th floor where the relic of Buddha's tooth is you may not take photos or videos. There is so much art and history to look through that you could easily spend a few hours. There are also kiosks to purchase souveniers or pay for offerings. As this is a sacred temple, there are people offering their respects and spaces for meditation."
,,Very precious Chinese temple,5.0,,"We were very pleased with everything, the atmosphere, the spirit, the museum and the gardens Peaceful place in a hectic city"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,We visited this temple during our holiday in Singapore - it’s about a 10-15 minute walk from the marina area. It’s a very interesting place with a lot to see especially in the museum. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"Whether you're an avid Buddhist or just passing through you will find this temple holds a special place for everyone. So much to see and do, please don't cut your time short be sure to allow at least half a day for your visit and make sure you visit the roof top gardens and ring the bell."
,,Impressive temple in the heart of Chinatown,4.0,,"Te entrance to this beautiful and impressive modern buddhist temple is free and well worth it. It is a quiet place but always busy with people, and is a great sight. With full Air Conditioning (!) it also offers a nice respite from the street scorching heat. It is just next door to the Chinatown Complex market, the food courts and the hawker center, and is easily visited on your walk through amazing Chinatown. This building stands alone in the neighborhood's cityscape, you just cannot miss it."
,,Air conditioned refuge working temple,3.0,,"Whilst it is a working buddhist temple, a large number of visitors are purely tourists. There are life size manikins of past and present senior buddhist monks from all over the world. A basement restaurant serve authentic buddhist (vegetarian) meals at restricted times during the day."
,,Best Budda,5.0,,Beautiful temple. The sound of the monks chanting was a wonderful experience to witness. The fourth floor of the temple is where you can see the Buddha's tooth enshrined in a pure gold alter. There are also meditation areas on the fourth floor. Saw people of all ages meditating. You can also light a candle and place it on the alter for a safe passage home. Here's to a safe flight home in a couple of weeks!
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,Nice place to visit while in Chinatown. Quite crowded but worth a visit. Morning visit is probably the best. Don't miss the rooftop part as well.
,,Temple in Chinatown,4.0,,The Buddha tooth relic temple is a beautiful temple right in china town. It is free to enter but women must wear a surong if they are not properly covered. Inside you can see statues and you can read up on your Chinese zodiac signs. You can smell incense burning from inside and outside of the temple and I believe it is still used for services so it does close to the public at certain times.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The best part of Chinatown for me, was walking into this temple and seeing monks reciting text. It made for an incredible ambiance."
,,Typical Southeast Asia Pagoda,4.0,,The building is huge and architecture is very nice. But it doesn’t have any extraordinary characteristics while compare to other existing pagoda. You can plan to have a visit if you are in nearby.
,,A bit sanitized,4.0,,"It's all a bit to modern & squeaky clean but the monks chanting give a great ambience
On the rooftop, the garden is a serene place (no sleeping permitted by order)
Don't miss the mezzanine floor; the wax figures of monks are so realistic to be a bit freaky. There is also an amazing collection of bronze statues from Taiwan which surely deserve greater prominence, some are astonishing"
,,Such a beautiful temple,5.0,,The temple is so beautiful and the size is decidedly beautiful and well worth the effort to see all the floors as from the outside it is hard to see the rooftop garden but well worth going through every floor.
,,Peace,5.0,,Peaceful temple in the very busy Chinatown With the visit for Buddhists ! For non Buddhist can go there and admire the architecture of the temple
,,Interesting visit,3.0,,would have like more of a tour but I recognise this may not be possible in a Temple in which worship still takes place

There is a lot to read, to see and it offers the possibility to retreat and meditate, if wanted."

The temple was luxurious and its interesting take a walk in the museum located on the third floor of the temple - very nice statues carved and originated from different parts of the world. The tiles made of real gold and it was a very refreshing experience for me to see gold tiles made in respect of the Buddha. You can see many different relics too. The temple has a good relaxing atmosphere to do meditation too. Most important of all, the food at the basement level was nice and authentic. Food is $3 per plate with special dishes everyday and they will require you to put the money in the charity box. Yes, and admission is free though you can donate money at the donation box or buy offerings such as candles and flowers to pray."

,,"Beautiful, fascinating history, observe a ceremony",4.0,,"This impressive building of fairly recent construction in Chinatown is both a functioning Buddhist temple (we were lucky enough to observe a liturgical ceremony of chanting) and a museum which chronicles the history and culture of Buddhism. A courtyard garden houses a massive prayer wheel. Tips: Admission is free (although there are donation boxes if you are so inclined). No photography is allowed in the sacred relic chamber. Dress modestly (no bare backs or shoulders, shorts or mini-skirts)."

Beautiful temple and nice change of pace. Make sure you go upstairs to see the relic as it could be easy to miss where you go up in the lift. Orchid garden on rooftop also beautiful.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Having seen the buddha tooth relic temple in Candy, SriLanka we wanted to see this one. The temple is a beautiful building and well adorned inside. However unlike SriLanka this tooth relic is only displayed twice a year, with the Chinese new year and with Buddha's birthday."

The place has meditation spots, so maintain silence and offer your prayers."
,,enjoyable,4.0,,"Very pretty place inside, but the day we went there were many people around and was hard to get in and have a look. The coaches out side were 6 deep in this little street.
Just be weary of when to go try to avoid Saturday."

This was a great experience, and is just minutes walk away from Chinatown."

,,A beautiful ornate Temple,4.0,,"I have recently visited Singapore where I spent 5 nights. This was my first time in this lovely country.

I first saw this temple after driving past on the Hippo hop on/off bus. It wasn't until I had to exchange buses one night behind the temple on our way to the Singapore Zoo, that I actually went inside for a look.

As with all Chinese temples, this was ornate in vibrant red and gold colours. The size of the temple is huge, inviting and serene. The worshippers and temple staff certainly didn't mind us tourists taking photos either. I've visited many temples throughout Asia and I must say that is certainly up with the best.

I would certainly recommend a visit to this beautiful temple."
,,Special experience on Vesak Day,4.0,,"Interesting blend of Asian styles for this bouddhist temple with rich golden interiors. But what makes it a wonderful place to visit and a special experience is the faith of the huge, huge crowd of devotees and the special display to the public of the Buddha tooth relic with devotees ""chanting"" prayers on the 4th floor on Vesak Day"
,,must,4.0,,If in Singapore this certainly is a must. Not that it is very dofferent of other similar temples. But it is a good place in Singapore and hence you have to experience it. Something else it is then anyway.
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple And Museum!!,5.0,,"Beautiful temple showcasing Buddha life and culture.This temple is located in the vicinity of China Town so you can visit both places in one go. Walking distance from China Town MRT. You must visit the place to feel the peaceful vibes. If one is not appropriately dressed, they provide sarongs and shawls.No caps allowed inside. allowed.Photography allowed on all levels except Level 4. Place is extremely well kept and beautiful."
,,"wow... amazing, and a prayer chant in progress",5.0,,"We were lucky to catch the buddists at a prayer chant. just stood and watched, amazing. But the temple is something else. covers 4 storys, with a museum also. You can visit the tooth relic on the fourth floor, but cant take photos in the chamber. Worth going out of your way to see."
,,Normal,3.0,,"Really a normal site for visiting. Wouldn’t call it a must visit but if you’re in the Chinatown district, might be worth a visit."

,,A peaceful temple in busy Singapore,5.0,,"It is located in Chinatown, a red and 4 story temple that certainly catches attention, The main hall on the first floor is always busy and crowed by a mixture of locals and tourists. The Buddha Tooth Relic is kept in a chamber on the 4th floor. Unlike the busy first floor, the Buddha Tooth Relic hall is very quiet and religiously peaceful. The temple provides seating area in the hall for people to sit down and meditate. I really enjoyed my visit to the temple."
,,AMAZING BUILDING WHICH WE DISCOVERED BY CHANCE ONCE IN CHINATOWN !!!,5.0,,"During a 6 nights stay in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and 2 nights in Mandarin Oriental Hotel, my wife and I decided to visit Chinatown and by chance, we discovered by night this awesome chinese building which really worths to be seen, at least from the outside !

I will soon add some photos for you to see the reality.

,,Vesak Day,5.0,,Felt extremely good after the visit. I will be back again. Although it was very crowded but I felt it's all worth it.
,,Very Serene & Peaceful place,4.0,,"It is situated in China Town & is definitely worth a visit. The Golden Buddha, the basement subsidized food cafeteria all worth seeing."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Relatively new temple in the center of China Town. Having travelled around Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, it was certainly one of the most beautiful. Those who say that there is nothing to see obviously didn't go to the other floors where there are exhibitions of artifacts and Buddha's, nor did they go to the temple above or the wonderful garden on the roof.
The staff and monks were amongst the most polite, friendly and helpful that we came across.
A must see. Peace, tranquility and areas for meditation."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,A bit of cultural play when in Singapore. You can’t help but feel the love these guys have for their Budda. Something heart warming about this place.
,,Fabulous temple,5.0,,"We enjoyed an hour walking around here, just make sure you are fully covered before you enter although they do have items you can drape around yourself. Women need to be covered at least to the knees and elbows and chest covered too. Make sure you go to the very top floor there is a beautiful roof top garden that a lot of people seem to miss!"
,,Beautiful Temple!,5.0,,"We visited The Buddha Tooth Temple on Vesak Day early in the morning to avoid the crowd of devotees. It’s a beautiful temple but seems overly glitzy to us, and it could be because of the decorations for Vesak Day.
Take the side lifts to each of the upper floors and we especially enjoyed the serene rooftop gardens."
,,"More than just a temple, don’t miss out!",4.0,,"We had friends in from London and they wanted to visit a temple of each of the major religions of Singapore.

I had passed this place more times than I can remember. Was really surprised by how much there is to see.

The ground floor is a place of worship though it has obviously been designed to accommodate tourists. Now take note that the tooth relic itself is not on the ground floor.

I highly recommend you use the lift to visit the museum upstairs, yes there is a museum! It has historical pieces from across Asia and uses them to tell the story of Buddha and a digital screen will also tell you about every single piece. If you have a genuine interest in learning about the history around Buddha then this is a must!

Above that floor is where the tooth relic is housed. It is open to the public but is also a place of worship so no footwear or photography.

From there you can take the stairs to the rooftop orchid garden. A place of tranquility and peace amongst the noise of Chinatown.

Keep in mind this is still a temple, so there are some attire guidelines to dress modestly, nothing too revealing. Enjoy!"
,,Visual spectacle,5.0,,"Located in chinatown, this was the first place we visited in Singapore and it was breathtaking. Nice place for those who want to pray or just admire the beauty of this temple. Beautiful small buddha idols are lined up everywhere, a very quiet, clean, and peaceful place. Visually very beautiful."
,,Buddha Tooth Temple,3.0,,Within walking distance from Chinatown. Bustling with human activities in surrounding area. No fee to enter.
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,We visited the temple as we were in Chinatown and saw it. It has some of the most beautiful embroidered wall hangings. It has 100 buddhas-each individually made by different artisans.You are able to borrow a shawl if your arms are bare(to show respect). Well worth a half hour of your time
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"It is a huge and beautiful temple. You have 5 or 6 levels and you need to go on the top of the Temple (fewer people, more peaceful). I spend maybe 2-3hours but I feel like it wasn't enough."
,,Best Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"We took the opportunity of visiting the Buddha Tooth Relic to spend a whole day session with a Buddhist Monk, who taught us how to meditate, in a detailed and deep way.

,,Lots to See,5.0,,There is a lot to see here. Make sure you take the stairs and stop at all the floors. Lots of history on Buddhism to learn.
,,Singapore Visit,5.0,,"Must visit place. Next to Chinatown. Most venerable place for Singaporean Buddhists. After this, we visited Chinatown. Not a fancy looking place. Great foods, and pretty damn cheap for Singapore. We went to Michelin star place. It just cost just about 2 CAD per person."
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,"What a beautiful Temple inside and out! So glad I went here was such a moving experience! Highly recommended! So many beautiful Bhudda statues and actually seeing the Monks teaching was something else! Make sure you visit here when in Singapore!
A visit to the roof garden on level 4 is a must do also! A tranquil and serene place."
,,Go inside and experience the prayer,4.0,,"There is actually a Buddha Tooth relic in the top floor, which you can take a look at. Other highlights would be to experience the mass prayer at the grand hall in the first floor and the nicely maintained museum upstairs."
,,Very busy and beautiful,4.0,,We visited while they were doing spiritual readings and monks rythmicly reading. Lots of beautiful Buddha's and offerings to each. Incense in the air adds to the experience.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"I really enjoy visiting temples and places of worship for their architecture and history. I must say this temple was more beautiful than I expected. It is an active temple so please be respectful of the worshipers. The inside is absolutely stunning and you can spend a lot of time looking at the outside, but for the heat."
,,Love! Love! Love!,5.0,,"One of my favorite places to escape in Singapore is here!!

Be sure to visit every floor. There is a divine rooftop with a gorgeous peaceful garden. An incredible museum with the life history of Buddha, and a stunning temple full of gold buddhas and peaceful places to meditate.

The main temple is so peaceful and you can enjoy tge space from the balconies.

Beautiful!!"
,,Nice photo op,4.0,,"It is a beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown. Worth seeing. As for cultural value, I found it too crowded at midday so it took away the serenity. There are more peaceful temples but nothing on this scale."
,,Interesting but only worth a short visit.,3.0,,"The temple is open to the public FOC. It’s quite a tranquil place amidst the bussle of Chinatown. There is not a great deal to see but, if you are a Buddhist, it will be on interest."

,,Amazing Buddhist site,4.0,,"I have a love for all things Buddha, and stayed at a hotel in Chinatown just to be close to this attraction. It was an enjoyable place, with many floors full of buddhist art and relics. If you wear any revealing clothing or a dress at or above the knee, you'll be asked to cover up (cover ups are provided). It is a very nice place if you enjoy the Buddhist culture."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning temple, i had never been inside one before but it was absolutely breath taking

However I advise if your a woman going wear longer shorts or skirt and a tshirt. We went in vest and shorts and had to wear a long skirt and scarf that they gave us which made things very hot but obviously you have to be respectful and keep it on. So dress whisley before you go but I'd definitely recommend going."
,,A must-see! Very beautiful and LOTS to see in the building!,5.0,,"Wow is all I can say! This temple is gorgeous! If you are Buddhist or interested in Buddhism or history, this is a must! My 5 year old did well here, but after the visit to the first floor and top floor was bored. I loved seeing the artifacts on the other floors but to a child it was redundant. The ginormous prayer wheel on the roof was great for everyone and the main room was amazing. If you don't have kids, you can wander each floor and marvel at all the artifacts and educational opportunities. Loved it! Garments provided if you are not modestly dressed."
,,"Peace, Serenity and Meditation",4.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic on the 4th level is a solemn place that reminds us of history of mankind and philosophy of Buddha. The ground floor Sanctum Sanctorum exudes a mystic and spiritual environment with chanting of mantras.
,,A feast for the senses,5.0,,A partially overlooked attraction of Singapore for majority tourists. And that's a good thing. Apart from an intricately decorated temple it's located in Singapore's amazing China town.. the place is a feast for the senses. Highly recommended.

Thousands of Buddha statues lining the walls, and all representative of personal/monthly zodiac signs. On the above floors is a serene area where the tooth relic is held and displayed with room available for supplicants and those who wish to meditate (timings are limited here);

The a very peaceful rooftop garden tops off the whole place with a large prayer wheel, all deep in the heart of the city"
,,Very new temple,5.0,,"This is not the biggest temple that you will see in other Asian countries. It is very new tough, I think 10 years old. Right next to China town complex. Many budda status inside, has something to do with Chinese zodiac. I do not really understand them. Tour this temple together when you pay visit to China town, many local food stalls."
,,Serene and beautiful place,4.0,,Such a beautiful place in the middle of a busy city. Toilet facilities are also available. You are welcome to light an insincere stick even if you are not of that religion.
,,Old Singapore,5.0,,If you have bare legs they will ask you to put on one of the skirts they provide from the basket. My daughter and I were carrying shawls which do come in handy whilst visiting temples and religious sites. It’s wonderful that we are allowed to enter these sacred places to see the sear opulence of the Hindu Temples. The gold and bright colours are a sight to see. The temple is a place of worship and tourist should respect the no photo signs within which sadly was not always the case. There is a donation box at both entries.
,,The wall is full of Buddhas with various of facial expressions,4.0,,The temple is very clean and full of Buddha statues. Long skirts and scarves are ready for you in front of entrance.

,,Buddha Everywhere,5.0,,"My friend enjoyed this place and took a lot of photos. When you visit China town don’t forget to come and see this place. Dress properly as they don’t allow sleeveless and shorts but good thing is, you can barrow scarf and long fabric to cover your legs. You see hundreds or even a thousand of Buddha inside, you can also light incense and pray. No admission it’s FREE."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,"I enjoyed walking through the main temple and halls on the ground level. I did not pay to go into the upper levels. they had a service each hour that was amazing to watch. Incense sticks are free, but you can purchase candles for a reasonable cost to"

,,Extravagant and gold,4.0,,Temple filled with gold statues of Buddhas. Definitely not for spiritual seeking. But more of exhibiting the extravagant site of the Buddhist culture. Love the statues of Buddhas that were stationed in the walls. It doesn't give out a calm or spiritual feeling but it's definitely an experience I would say.
,,a real cultural experience,5.0,,My first Buddist temple and was amazed at the intricate designs. The room full of chanting monks and followers was intriguing and credit to them for allowing the constant flow of tourists.

,,Incredible structure,5.0,,"Though only built 15 years ago, the care and detail that went into this museum and temple is mind-bending. Truly worth a stop in Chinatown."
,,Definitely worth a visit..,5.0,,"The temple itself is huge with different levels, each with its own focus and flavor. The museum was also very big, well organized and informative. The highlight was the tooth relic which was really fancy and the rooftop garden with the enormous prayer wheel."
,,ITS OK,3.0,,"There are plenty of temples to visit and at this point I may be a bit templed out,worth a look, but there is better."
,,Stop over when you are in Chinatown area,3.0,,Interesting venue right in the middle of the famous Chinatown of Singapore surrounded by many shopping and dining options. Night time is better as it can get abit hot during the day
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This place is extremely peaceful and wonderful, I do recommend the visit, disregard of your religion."
,,Beautiful Pagoda,5.0,,"We stayed in China Town and easy to walk there, no entrance fee. Everyone comes here alot to pay for lucky. It is colourful and nice architecture. Everyone should not wear short or mini skirt."
,,Love,5.0,,"Loved the Buddha temple, it felt at home for me 😍 I could of spent hours here , u can light a incense before u go in , there is a wall with a hundred Buddha’s which was great 👍"
,,Cool but...,2.0,,"This massive money making machine is pretty cool to visit. Everything is for sale, every little feature on every wall has a price tag so it's a bit like a huge Buddhist shop.
The 3rd floor features a museum of Buddha's body parts. (They claim those are actual pieces of buddha's corpse: Blood, brains, heart, liver, muscle, skin etc...) Only gruesome if you believe they're not plastic beads.
The security are unnecessarily tough and unflexible. If they decide that your camera is 'too professional', you'll be summoned to their office where you will wait for an hour for someone to come talk to you and decide if you can film. (We got sick of waiting and left)."
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"Very rich and beautiful exteriors and interiors, very calm and peaceful place. Lot of colorful art work to enjoy while going around. Surrounded by lot of shops around in the street to shop gift items."
,,Free temple / museum,5.0,,"This place was a lot bigger than I expected. There's the temple and the buddha tooth floors, but also some floors with buddha artefacts and also the history of buddhism. The top floor is a lovely relaxing garden. You'll need enough time to visit everything. They give you a scarf to cover shoulders / legs."
,,Golden beauty,4.0,,"The temple itself is beautiful, with intricate golden details everywhere which are handmade. However, if you're wearing shorts or short clothing you have to put on a robe of sorts, out of respect before you enter the temple. Other than that the temple is beautiful with many statues and lovely tapestries."
,,Beautiful ad well restored,4.0,,"On a Sunday of course too full of tourists, and that's always a pity as it takes a lot of the ""sacredness"" away. You would like these places to be solely for their religious purpose, but I know that can't be. The statues are amazing and the place is well restored"
,,Must see,5.0,,"A beautiful, well maintained temple in Chinatown. Very touristy yet not packed. Beautiful garden on the rooftop. Visit is free, but you can donate if you want."
,,A place for everyone,5.0,,Eyerbody should visit this peaceful and very interesting place even if you are not a Buddist. It's amazing.
,,Not been to an attraction like this before,5.0,,Learned a lot about Buddhism by visiting this site. Interesting to explore the different levels within the building. Worth visiting the roof top for a peaceful place.
,,First time,5.0,,This is the first time I have a bit of time to explore the vicinity when on business trip. Very unique experience.
,,Very interesting and worth the time to visit.,5.0,,Our tour guide took us here and it was a highlight of the tour. It's something worth visting and understanding the history behind it.
,,Beautiful and serene place to visit. A must see.,5.0,,The temple has a majestic external appearance. As you approach you hear chanting. Inside the temple there are golden Buddhas which are beautiful. Unfortunately we didn't have time to explore the upper floors but we hope to return and do just that. There is no restriction on photos but out of respect I would suggest you don't use flash. We got plenty on our phones and they all turned out well. Uncovered shoulders are not appropriate but the temple provides free wraps. The worshippers and staff were respectful and helpful. It's a must see. Beautiful and serene.
,,Amazing building!,5.0,,"So this one was really an stunning view!
After walking all day we ended up in China town and right outside of the China town you’ll have the Buddha temple which is an amazing view specially when your in the China town!

So big and absolutely breathtaking vibration color this one is a must in Singapore!

If you want to take a great photo I oils recommend to behind the driveway to really get a full picture of the temple.

,,Mesmerising work of art!,5.0,,"You feel a sense of calm as you enter this meditative heaven. A visual sensory overload while observing the various poses of the numerous mini idols on the walls. Each floor in the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple houses awe inspising works of art. One of the floors also houses a historical timeline of the temple with artefacts. The 4th floor of the temple houses the golden abode of Buddha, where the tiles, roof and the idol itself are encased in gold(Photography is prohibited on this floor). Below are a few pictures clicked by me and my husband during our visit. It also has a roof top orchid garden and a few seats to rest and enjoy the sight and fresh air. Over all it is one of the places you must visit on your trip to Singapore!"

So there's really a tooth on the 4th floor, purportedly of buddha's , found in myanmar in 1980. It's like fort knox and no photos allowed. The other floors seem ok for photo taking

The museum about Buddha’s life was amazing and educational. Our young girls leant a lot.

The garden in the roof is an oasis of tranquility. We loved it.

One thing they need to do is to enforce the no photo taking rule. Some tourists need to learn to observe rules."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It really is beautiful. A great way to absorb some of the local culture and get a better understanding.

,,Busy but interesting temple,3.0,,"Despite it being quite busy, this was an interesting temple to visit both on the ground floor and the tooth relic floor. Doesn’t take too long to look round though, and probably not worth fighting against crowds too much if you can help it."
,,Visit temple,5.0,,"Very informative, enlightening, learning, Pearceful and beautiful. We enjoy a lots. I can be there many hours."
,,Attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"The temple has a tooth of Gautam Buddha kept on the 4th floor of the building.

On the ground floor there is a statue of Lord Buddha and provision to offer incense sticks. The overall atmosphere is very religious and relaxing."

,,Great stop,5.0,,"Really awesome temple. There are 5 floors all of which we were able to go up but I guess sometimes certain rooms are closed depending on the schedule. There are lots of really ornate beautiful areas of this temple, including the Buddha tooth part on the fourth floor. I would definitely recommend a stop by here. It's also near an excellent hawker center."
,,Night Time Colour,4.0,,We discovered the temple on our evening walk and marvelled at the illuminated architecture. This is a gem of a building in the heart of Chinatown and worth a small detour from the main shopping area just to gaze and wonder at its sheer size and magnificence beautifully illuminated at night.
,,Amazing Temple,5.0,,"We spent the day walking around this area and specifically headed for this particular temple. We were not disappointed. really enjoyed seeing all the Buddhas and the beauty of the Temple. The early history was interesting as well.. It is a short visit, really 10 minutes or so, and it's free. Be sure to dress appropriately (covered knees and covered shoulders & back, no hats)."
,,Quite a place,5.0,,We had not planned on stopping here because we have spent three months visiting temples. So glad we stopped by as this place was gorgeous. Beautifully designed temple and beautiful inside Buddha’s and layout. The outside design is also exquisite
,,Fascinating temple to visit near china town.,5.0,,Really interesting place to visit. And free! Lots of mini Buddha’s and interesting link to the zodiac. Go to the top and see the prayer wheel.
,,excellent,5.0,,"was in china town and decided to visit this, was amazing. so many things to see and just a quiet place away from the bustle of china town"
,,Well worth the visit.,5.0,,"This is a temple in the Chinatown section of Singapore. It was full of visitors and worshippers when we went. You didn't have to cover up, like in other temples we visited this day. The temple is in two distinct halves with plenty of interesting features in each. In the second half, as well as shrines, there were lots of tables and chairs for people to study - some were eating here too. The scale and magnificence of the temple has to be seen to be believed. Do go here if you are in Singapore. lt's free to visit."
,,Gorgeous and So many Buddhas,4.0,,"I really enjoyed seeing all the Buddhas and the beauty of the Temple. I feel like I needed a bit more history about the space to fully understand it all but it was great. It is a short visit, really 10 minutes or so, but it is free so why not go in. Be sure to dress appropriately (covered knees and covered shoulders & back)."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"I am not a Buddhist, however, one of my best friends is and I always make an attempt to visit a temple when I see one for her. I visited this temple during a trip to Singapore and it was a very enlightening experience for me. The environment here is so calming it could relax anyone. Another great thing about this temple is that it is very crowded with locals, so you do not feel like another out of place tourist."
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,This is a working temple as well as a museum. Very interesting look into the Buddhist community. Loved the tranquil rooftop garden. A quiet place to rake 5.
,,The usual golden buddhas with a lot of history,5.0,,"We decided to try our hand at commuting when we visited Singapore. This temple is fairly easy to locate via google maps, but good god, when you follow the fastest route to this place, google maps will make you pass back alleys and what nots. So my advice, take the cab. If you take the bus, there's still some distance you'll be walking. The temple is divine. The first floor is very elegantly and intricately decorated. A lot of buddhas to see, with the main hall housing the biggest gold buddha in the temple. Behind the temple is China town, with a lot of small local shops and restaurants."
,,Neat stop in Chinatown,4.0,,"Our tour took us to this temple which was neat both outside and within. Main level is beautiful, but the 4th floor is where you go to see the relic. Don’t miss going up the stairs from there to the rooftop."
,,"Allow time, start at the top – some tips",5.0,,"You can't miss the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, it's the large temple in Chinatown near the shopping mall, and it's huge. It's also a very impressive place inside and depending on your level of interest you can spent from 2 hours to 15 minutes. Some tips to enjoy your visit:

1. Dress appropriately. In other words, cover up…not short shorts, minis, bare backs, bare shoulders, etc. If you aren't properly dressed they won't admit you, however, if you have a problem there's a market right outside where you can buy a souvenir wrap, skirt, shawl, etc. that will also be a nice souvenir. There are some places where you need to remove your shoes. Staff are there to monitor things and let you know where this is required.

2. Start at the top. There are gardens at the top level and inside the Ten Thousand Buddhas Pavilion is a huge cloisonné enamel prayer wheel. Also on the upper floors are the Sacred Light Hall and the Inner and Outer Chamber where the Sacred Buddha Tooth is housed in an elegant surrounding. The ceiling is lit with Tang-style lanterns.

3. If your visit coincides with chanting in the main temple area on the ground floor, take some time to just walk slowly around the outer perimeter and absorb the atmosphere and the chanting. Going up to the mezzanine also provides a good view of the main area and an opportunity to take in all the lush décor.

4. They sell offerings and souvenirs, incense, etc. all on the pricey side, but there is a lot of work involved in maintaining this temple, so it's worth supporting."
,,Good if you love temple,3.0,,Busy and hot may be just because I'm not a huge fan of temple.but it look different than normal temple.Good for pictures
,,Lovely team,5.0,,"Best tour i have ever experiance thanks to Colin ,Yap,Ty lovely team and recommend every one who is travaling to Singapore to try them . Finally thanks alot for all your support team BOOM BOOM �"
,,A Shining Temple,4.0,,"A beautiful local temple in the heart of Singapore, a wonderful city of multicultural religious churches, mosques, and temples. This is newly renovated, although you would be hard pressed to tell, except for the air conditioning and underground car park. Very busy, but certainly worth a visit."
,,Buddhas Tooth,5.0,,"A truly awe inspiring place , our guide took us in as ceremony was beginning, really moving , as spiritual a place as you will ever see. you are allowed up various floors including a roof garden,"
,,"Impressive, though difficult to access",4.0,,"If you have never seen a Buddhist temple - this is just for you. Its architecture is truly inspiring and the experience will leave you feeling serene, regardless of the chaos on the streets of Singapore. Still, if you have accessibility issues, it will be hard to get to the temple and its surroundings. The gift shops in the area have good offers."
,,Busy place,5.0,,The place is nice. A lot of people inside. There is a museum upstairs so make sure you go around the place and dont be shy to go upper floors
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,5.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum was simply amazing cultural experience. The colors, the people, the Buddha's, a photographers dream."
,,Spring festival prayer,5.0,,A very auspiciois n cosy temple. The artifacts n long story about è founder buddha in buddhism was very well illustrate thru out Asia the steps of buddha's disciples n followers way far from East to West of è global earth. Legends n statues all well define n explain very clearly all about è early buddhism.More fantastic is è vegetarian restaurant below è building a ver cosy large serenity place to lunch or catch some bits n bites. Prices are very localised hawker price with wonderful peace of place to dine.Wall Design n buddha statues were very bored n gold plated. Very elegant n rich a place for worships. Well done must see to believed.

,,Very interesting visit,5.0,,"Made very welcome here - didn't realise the significance of the tooth relic. The room where the tooth is just stunning - the amount of gold there is awe inspiring - no photography allowed (saw someone shouted at and made to delete their images when they tried to take photos (despite all the signs and warnings)).

The rooftop garden and biggest prayer wheel in the world are also well worth a visit.

The temple on the ground floor is beautiful.

Do go."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,A very huge and beautiful temple. Worth for a visit and prayer if you are a buddhist. Very clean with beautiful rooftop garden.
,,Another must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Well, the title I have put says it all. Its beautiful, authentic, the staff is respectful, is in the middle of Chinatown... is simply a must see of Singapore. Some tips I would propose are: 1) be respectful and considerate, this is a temple not a night club... This means:, put the phone in silence, take your sunglasses/cap off, do not eat, talk quietly etc; 2) come here before 7 pm. They close it at that time for the public. 3) do not worry about wearing shorts or mini skirts, the temple will offer you some fabric to cover the legs which is mandatory but don't worry they lend you that fabric for free."
,,Not Worth The Trip,1.0,,"The building is very large for a ""temple"" and the design is typically Chinese. I hated the smoke pollution inside this enclosed area though, it's quite unnecessary."
,,A little piece of tranquility in buzzin Chinatown,5.0,,Modest clothing is a requirement but cover ups are available if you are dressed for the heat in shorts. Colour and thousands of tiny Buddhas to see and if you get the timing right a service to witness.. A island of meditation in busy Singapore.
,,Don't forget to see the rooftop garden,5.0,,"The temple is magnificent though bit too colorful for my taste. Our best surprise was the rooftop garden. There is lift to take you to the top. The garden on top It is not large but has many beautiful orchids, a large prayer wheel and very cool ambience even at 12:00 pm when the sun was directly overhead!"
,,Unique place,5.0,,"It is really beautiful and also it is very interesting to watch the locals praying with soo much devotion. It is definately worth the visit. They provide ""sarongs"" in the entrance in case you are not dressed appropriately. It is free."
,,Interesting and pretty,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is solemn, quiet, pretty and interesting place to visit while in China Town. Recommended !"
,,A special place,5.0,,"This is a great temple and an interresting place to learn more about Buddha. Clothes to provide cover up are lendt for free - entrance is free. Well worth a visit And Buddhas tooth is the Main reliquie, covered in a room of cold"
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,5.0,,"A relatively new Buddhist temple, in it there is a Buddha's tooth. The temple looks very good outside. There is also a museum at the temple."
,,Peace and harmony amongst tech city,5.0,,"Two feet outside the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, you know you're in one of the most modern cities in the world as you look skyward. Inside, peaceful and elegance of the Buddha Temple surround visitors. We stopped here during a bike ride of Singapore, 30 minutes was ample time for visitors to not interfere with daily prayers. Remember this is an active holy site, not a tourist stamp first and foremost. Sarongs are provided for free to cover legs, but use good judgement on attire and language inside. I have visited several Buddha Temples in the region, this did not disappoint."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,Very interesting place. Make sure you go upstairs & look at the museum & roof garden. Lots to see & free.
,,Superb Temple,4.0,,It was my first time to visit a temple that allowed to take pictures inside. Most of the temples that i visited so far does not allowed cameras inside. Be sure woman wear a modest dress when entering the temple. Explore the beauty of this temple. Respect locals when they pray inside the temple
,,Decent sized museum part to supplement visiting the temple,5.0,,"The temple is beautifully decorated with gold and the museum and the exhibits with the Buddha relics are decently sized. Everything is free. If your shorts or skirts isn't covering your knees, they give you a little cloth to wrap around yourself. You also need to cover your shoulders and make sure your top isn't too low"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,A very modern Buddhist Temple. The floor dedicated to the history of Buddhism and the historical artefacts was most interesting. Both women and men should remember to dress modestly and remember that this is a working place of worship.
,,Holy ambiance.,5.0,,A temple surrounded with very intricate carved images and fine decorations in red and gold hues. Very solace and smoothening admosphere.
,,Cover your shoulders and knees!,4.0,,They have coverups to borrow but depending on which side you come in on you may not see them. This was a cool place to see. They have a lot of history and the dedication to Buddha was quite impressive. Stop by while you’re in Chinatown!
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I recommend actually go from top to bottom! Ask for the elevator and start with a relaxing walk through the roof-top garden. Calm down and set up your mind for whats to come.

Then learn about Buddhismus and the Childhood of its creator in the Museum below, followed by the actual Temple that holds the relic. Be respectful in there, no shoes no photos.

By the time you arrive downstairs, you will have a better understanding of what you are actually looking at and it’s meaning."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"The building will definitely catch your eye, it's beautiful. It's located in Chinatown and if you are nearby have a look!"
,,Well designed temple,4.0,,I'm unsure why this temple was built in this area as it doesn't blend in well with surrounding CBD buildings. Good to step in to chill and learn something about Buddhism.
,,Must see if you're in Chinatown,4.0,,This temple is amazing and well worth a visit when you're in Singapore. It gets pretty busy not just with tourists but licals praying so try and go early or later in the day.
,,"Well worth the trip, expecially if you are in Chinatown",5.0,,Beautiful place to see and experience. Make sure you are dressed appropriately. Must see the wax figures on the second floor in the museum.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"This temple is located on the edge of ChinaTown, it is by far the largest building around the area. It is beautiful, inside and out with hundreds of tiny Buddhas and larger golden statues. There are places for worshippers to light incense sticks and to offer up thanks, open to Buddhists and tourists alike, a lovely place to visit when in Singapore, sorry I couldnt give more of a description but i am not a Buddhist.You can sponsor a statue I believe or leave a donation."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,Immaculate temple with all that you might expect at a place of worship such at this. In the heart of China Town its easy to get to and on our visit there wasn’t any wait or line. Increasingly well maintained and presented this is worth a visit if you are in the area.
,,Go Inside its free!,4.0,,I liked going inside this temple and admire their religious belief. you can take a picture inside but please observe silence and respect.
,,Worth seeing!!,5.0,,"This is a beautiful temple and worth seeing. Besides the temple, it has beautiful gardens, displays of museum like items on each floor."
,,Beautiful temple worth spending your time in.,4.0,,"If you ask me what kind of person am I, and you give me the following options ""someone that loves to see temples"", ""someone that prefers to watch something else other than a temple"" or ""someone that really hates temples"" I would have to say I am in the second group, leaning a bit towards the third if the temple transfer this message of ""You are nothing! You are less than nothing! Let me crush you with all the money we have extracted out of people! Die now, DIE!!!""

And when my missus told me we were coming to Chinatown and this was one of the attractions I hesitated but decided to give it a go. Upon your arrival, you will notice there are two entrances, one considered the front with a huge Buddha and a gazillion little Buddhas on its walls and the back that is a lot more modest and most people go there first; so we did.

The colours of the temple (almost all red and gold) give you an interesting composition difficult to photograph because of the poor light. Nevertheless, the second entrance wasn't that much on your face and I felt I wanted to move a little bit deeper into the temple, taking photos and contemplating the noisy silence in it. (Noisy silence is that silence that you got to have but it comes out of a constant whispering that accumulates enough to be part of your white background...)

At this point, you notice all the little Buddha are numbered and if you read carefully, you will read it has a ridiculous amount of it. You might not be able to imagine how many... but we are talking about statues about 12 centimetres (4 inches) tall in a box... covering every single wall from top to bottom and the walls are about 5 or 5 1/2 metres tall... maybe taller than that.

If you walk towards the main entrance, you will find to your right the entrance to the museum which tells you about the religion, relics, gives you access to some gardens and other little things. If you are already here, you better check out the museum as it is interesting."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"I'm sure for some, this is an important place. However, for the basic tourist, it was a little hard to take seriously. Easy to visit, near Chinatown."
,,New and glossy with a surprisingly informative museum,5.0,,"You get. Lot of glossy bling here, all gold and orchids, we visited just before lunar new year so was very busy downstairs but the sections upstairs comprising of the charming roof gardens, Buddha Tooth Relic Hall and very informative museum explaining Buddhism were quiet and well worth a visit."
,,Gorgeous Temple,5.0,,In a city full of architecture and wealth this was a beautiful temple that all can enter and a great break from the skyscrapers. I think this is a must see when coming to Singapore. Enjoy the shopping in Chinatown nearby when visiting.
,,"Just temple, like many others",3.0,,For non buddisth IT is just another temple. Golden Buddah inside. A lot of gifts from naive belivers ;)
,,Great,5.0,,"Great place to visit and feel the calmness of the temple. Didn't have a guide, but didn't it either. The museum is very well labelled. Expect respectful dress code. no spaghetti strap and long shorts (covering the knees) are expected"
,,Sigificant free museum,5.0,,"Located in a very striking building on Sago Street in Chinatown, it doubles as a place of worship and a museum. As such it is pleasantly quiet. A little difficult to find the entrance, we eventually found a way in on Banda Street. The building was under construction on our last visit 10 years ago so it was interesting to see how a building site turned into a traditional looking large building.

Ther are a number of floors and a roof garden. The halls are very ornate with many thousands of Buddhas on shelves, on the walls, and everywhere else.

As for the tooth relic; it's very difficult to see and not really very significant for a non Buddhist."
,,Unexpected visit!,5.0,,"Stumbled across this temple when walking around chinatown and decided to head in. If not dressed correctly, you can borrow items when entering the temple. Also, don't forget to head upstairs to see the wax dolls and also the buddah tooth and rooftop garden!"
,,An oasis of calm,5.0,,One of the most beautiful and ornate Buddhist temples I've visited! Bang in the middle of Chinatown (easily accessible by MRT) - this is a must do for visitors and those living in SG. Do take the lift upstairs to visit the rooftop garden and the museum.
,,Good visit,4.0,,"It serves both as an active temple in the Buddhist tradition, as well as a museum of Chinese history in Singapore. It is a good site to visit and, combined with the National Museum"
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"An interesting, somewhat sprawling complex, but without commentary its hard to know what its all about. Be respectful if you go and take your shoes of well outside of the front door."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The hotel was very close so it was our last spot to visit before we left to the airport. Take your time, there are so many beautiful rooms to look at."
,,"It's a tooth ""relic""",2.0,,"Only visited the first floor, so perhaps I missed where the relic is on the 4th floor? It was super busy because of the Chinese New Year and I had gone to the one in Sri Lanka a few weeks before, so I wasn't motivated and it seemed more loke a tourist attraction than a relic."
,,An Oasis of Peace in busy Chinatown.,5.0,,"We were following a walking route through Chinatown from our Lonely Planet Guide and came across this large temple in the middle of roadworks and a bus station. We went inside, respecting other visitors who were there to worship. There is a dress code but there was no requirement to take off shoes.

Having seen the Buddha at the front of the temple we walked through to a much larger than expected hall, where we admired the intricate carvings and general peaceful atmosphere."
,,One of the most beautiful temple I ever saw,5.0,,Inside as much as outside was gorgeous. Very colorful and I had space for pray even if it’s was crowded (Chinese new year). I really recommended to visit it.
,,Worth dropping in,4.0,,"If you are in Chinatown you will not be able to miss the Buddha Relic Temple. It really is quite a beautiful piece of architecture, but a pity that it is so close to some pretty down market stalls and shops. Nevertheless you can go in and see the inside, it is worth it, but remember ladies that you will need to cover your shoulders or entry will be prohibited. If you forget something to cover yourself up, scarfs are sold outside, I think for 5 Singapore Dollars."
,,Beautiful and Peaceful place,4.0,,Although this is a relatively new attraction ad it was built in thr early 2000's dont let this put you off going to see it. It is set in busy Chinatown with new building works all around it! However inside you will step into another world. The monks chanting and the smell of incense will transport you to another place. The relic room is awe inspiring and the museum is worth a look too.
,,One of its kind... mesmerizing and beautiful!,5.0,,This is one of the most beautiful temple which has a significance too. Do google and find out. Its located in China town and has specific visiting hours. I loved the feel of the temple.
,,A mystical experience!,5.0,,It was beautiful to be there during the public holiday: the atmosphere and the mysticism of the place are tangible. All the areas of the temple are beautiful and rich in details. You MUST visit this temple.
,,Ok,3.0,,"Ok , to take a photo. No need to rush there, this trip we visited & happened to be on 2nd day of Chinese New Year !!!! Omg , too too many people , worth a visit if it’s your 1st visit to singers but wouldn’t rush , but good to take a photo & then visit little India"
,,PLEASANT PLACE TO VISIT,3.0,,"Lovely artefacts and wonderful artwork. Pleasant place to visit but, in truth, not that much to see so doesn't take long to get around - particularly if it's not your real interest."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Located at chinatown, good to go if you are nearby. situated right in the center of chinatown, good for photos too."
,,Nice place,5.0,,If you have never visited a Buddhist temple this is an interesting one to begin at. It is welcome to the public and there are at least five different floors to explore on the ground level and above and there are some underground floors as well. There seems to be a lot of information on learning about Buddhism and if you have extra time in Singapore it would be a nice place to do this. Know that you do have to boil a wrap around for your lower half and she'll for your upper half if you have short sleeves or shorts or a short skirt on. There is no charge for this. There was a service being conducted there when I arrived and there was no problem to enter and watch it. It was quite fascinating
,,Magnificent Temple,5.0,,"We were there on preparation for Lunar New Year. The place was decorated beautifully. It is very good place to take picture. However there was a construction across the road which make this place so crowded and dusty.
Entering this temple is not prohibited, a lot of beautiful ornament inside the temple."
,,Stunning temple,4.0,,"Absolutely stunning temple, and not your typical temple with one or few statues, these walls are covered in them, and the details are incredible. Can get super crowded, would recommend going early to avoid the crowds."
,,Stunning Temple,5.0,,"This temple is stunning. There are thousands of Buddhas and dragons built into the walls, it was breathtaking. You must cover your shoulders to enter, so prepare accordingly."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"While you are in Chinatown please visit this big yet beautiful temple which is located within walking distance from Chinatown MRT Station and Chinatown Heritage Center.
As I too often visit any kind of temples all around places I have visited, this time I escorted a friend who is a first timer in Singapore and I convinced him this is a worth visit place."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Interesting architecture for some great photos. Doesn’t take much time to go through. Allow maybe 20 minutes.
,,Worth finding,4.0,,"A Buddhist temple in Singapore’s Chinatown area. It’s well-signposted, and it’s pretty obvious when you get there. There are a number of floors if you want to explore. Free admission to lower area, and welcomes visitors as long as they behave respectfully. Worth seeking out"
,,Best Temple,4.0,,"I like the thought of Buddhism & really wanted to pay a visit!

Out of respect cover up, they gave sarongs & scarves available for you to use & only take pictures in suitable places!

The temple is beautiful, so many buddhas & details of the Buddha that covers your Chinese both sign! There is also a gift shop on the way out!"
,,A worthy stop while in Chinatown!,4.0,,"If you opt to walk Chinatown while in Singapore, a stop at the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is worth it. Beautiful inside and out, you can take a moment to reflect on yourself and have a zen moment. A peaceful break from the chaotic streets of Chinatown!"
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"I'm not a huge fan of museums, or temples but this one was pretty good. lots of see on the different levels, the wax status were cool but creepy at the same time. Got to see the tooth, and then the garden on the roof."
,,Great family learning visit,5.0,,The inside was much more impressive than the exterior! Really appreciative of the great effort in the setup of such beautiful showcase of Buddhism! We plan to visit again & spend more time!
,,Busy place,4.0,,"Vissted this venue on a walking tour through China Town. Interesting place. Busy, with many tourists and locals paying their respect. Well worth a visit."
,,"Culture, faith and history",5.0,,"This is my first experience with a Buddhist temple and I loved every second. The place is nice from the outside, but stunning inside. And in spite of the rather large number of visitors, the atmosphere is always quiet and respectful. The place is an oasis of calm in Chinatown and also a great place for photography. No fees required, but one can make a donation. Also check our the higher levels to see a museum and the actual tooth relic (no photos in this area of the temple and also you need to remove your shoes)."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"We visited the temple while we were doing the Hippo hop on hop off. Beautiful place and you leave feeling the serenity. Ladies with bare shoulders are asked to cover up using one of the scarves they provide at the front door. Free to enter if you just want to look, I think there was also the opportunity to visit the top of the tower and there may have been a small fee for that. Worth getting off the bus to have a look."
,,"I felt at ease , calm and spiritualy connected with my self",5.0,,It was the highlight of my trip loved it. Something about the place was very spiritual and calming👌🏿
,,"Heritage of Singapore , Must visit in Singapore",5.0,,"This is one of the most iconic places to visit when in singapore, this place is in Chinatown & holds unique significance with culture & heritage of Singapore.. Must visit"
,,Interesting architecture,3.0,,A good place to walk around if you happen to be in Chinatown in Singapore. Nice to shoot pictures and watch the architecture
,,temple with caracter,4.0,,"went the week before chinese new year and there were several lanterns all over the temple and streets. lit up at night, it gave a great atmosphere. interesting architecture for me as im coming from japan. chinatown is just next door and this area can be very busy at different times of the day."
,,To visit when in Chinatown,4.0,,"Definietly a place to visit in Singapore, even though I've seen more stunning temples though this one is worth a visit for a chinese buddhism and burn an incense for a well being or world blessing."
,,good place at chinatown,3.0,,"if you feel hot or tired, it is a good place for rest and some water with air-condition. remember to bring your own bottle."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We really enjoyed going through this temple. Women must have their shoulders covered. I happened to be wearing a tank top, so I was required to wear one of their shawls during my visit. Took tons of pictures."
,,"Good, but far from the best",3.0,,"I think that there are more impressive temples to visit. This one is a combination of a massive retail outlet selling gifts and souvenirs on the ground floor, with 'the tooth' up on the fourth floor. There is no doubt that the fourth floor is beautifully decorated and if the gold is real, then absolutely dazzling. You can't get close to the tooth as it is in a sealed off, enclosed area, but there are close up pictures. Is it real? You can make your own mind up. No photography or video permitted.A few meditation areas."
,,Building work around it,3.0,,Just be warned that there are works going on around this temple and next to it which makes it feel like you are visiting something in the middle of a construction site.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Visited the beautiful temple and even prayed. It felt peaceful. There are hundreds of statues to see and everyone gets a chance ti pray if you want. Worth the visit.
,,Interesting view into a culture and religion,5.0,,During our visit a religious ceremony was occurring - priests chanting with participation from the worshipers. Interesting view into the culture and religion.
,,Very decorative but not a 'Must See',3.0,,"Perhaps I have visited to many temples but for me a Western tourist it was just another temple nothing special, a lot of gold & everything shines though I am sure for the people who worship here it is a special place but with it packed with tourists (yes me) we all just take lots of photo's & move on. Not being disrespectful but didn't do anything for me plus you don't even have to take your shoes off!

Much more interested in China town market which is nearby."
,,Beautiful Chinese Temple and Museum,5.0,,Beautiful Chinese temple in the middle of the city. Extra credit to the CNY decoration makes the view more mesmerizing and unforgetable. Went there early to avoid the crowd for better picture view.
,,Very Beautiful Buddha Temple.,5.0,,"Place is well maintained & very beautiful to visit.There are prayers going on all ways,which gives it a very serene atmosphere. The Garden on Top & The huge prayer wheel are worth seeing."
,,Enshrined in 35-ton Stupa,4.0,,"There are four stories to Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is located in Singapore’s Chinatown There are four floors plus a rooftop pagoda and prayer wheel for those who wish to escape the busyness of Chinatown. On the first floor, services and ceremonies are held. While we were there, one such ceremony was taking place. Worshippers were bringing gifts to a chanting monk at the front of the hall, and then someone else took the gift to the outside where it was burned in a vessel in an outdoor courtyard Enshrined on the walls both sides of the hall are hundreds of Buddhas. The second floor has a tea house that serves tea and has vegetarian food available for purchase. The Buddhist Culture Museum on the third floor is where artifacts of the Buddha are displayed. What most tourists come to see is located on the fourth floor in a special hall called the “Sacred Light Hall”. The Buddha tooth is in a 35-ton solid gold stupa (burial chamber). Only monks have access to the inner chamber but visitors/tourists are allowed to visit the viewing gallery two set times a day. Shows, concerts, and workshops are held in the Chinese theater located in the basement of the temple. Visitors must be appropriately dressed to enter the temple. Admission is free. A must see in Singapore. Photography is not allowed inside the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic Chamber."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Must visit this temple if you are in Chinatown, very impressive building and decour inside, very interesting."
,,Kind of hoaky but interesting,4.0,,"It was an interesting place to visit though I don't really believe that they have one of Buddha's teeth encased in a display. There was a long line to get up to the front where the ""tooth"" was displayed but not much to see when we got there. Guess it's worth seeing since Buddha's so important there."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,We visited on a 3 day trip to Singapore. Very interesting place to visit as a non-buddhist. Ideal little stop when in Chinatown.
,,First visit,5.0,,A step into the history and customs A little gem Would definitely recommend coming here Respectful of the no shows and shoulder coverings
,,Recommeded place to visit!,5.0,,Feel peaceful while visiting this stately temple. Very nice vegetarian food at basement with affordable price too. Love it!
,,Need to remember to take something to cover your shoulders.,5.0,,"You must remember to take something to cover your shoulders to enable you to go into the temple, although they do have things they can give you but you would prefer your own. Shoes have to be removed as it is the custom. This temple is not far from Chinatown so a visit can be done when visiting Chinatown. The temple is a typical type but enjoyable all the same."
,,An extravagant temple,5.0,,"Our friend brought me to this temple for the first time. It's close to Maxwell Food Centre and Chinatown. The main hall is big and in a gold theme. I could see monks chanting there. On 1st and 2nd floors, we could find lots of antiques and exhibits about Buddhism. The Buddha tooth is displayed on top floor. It's a peaceful temple and worth to visit."
,,Nice to see,4.0,,Nice to see but a little crude!! Rember to cover your legs!! Still nice and interior worth the detour!!
,,Really nice,5.0,,We like the temple. It is full of charm both inside and outside. Feel calm and peaceful. Really nice!
,,A Spiritual Experience,5.0,,"This is a large-scale temple with multiple rooms and ceremonies often taking place during one's visit. Visitors are made to feel welcome and meditation classes are open to all and offered on the third floor.

Seeing a procession going through the temple was the highlight of my visit but other parts of the temple can be very quiet and great for mediation and reflection. The rooftop garden is one of these places, and I recommend climbing op the extra floor to get there."
,,interesting but overrun,3.0,,popularity has ruined this great attraction. very interesting temple that is packed with camera welding tourists. visit a less popular temple in singapore (there are plenty of them)
,,A must see near Chinatown,5.0,,A beautiful Buddhist temple well worth the visit. Over several floors so much to see and photos allowed but be prepared to wrap exposed shoulders with shawls provided. Cool and air-conditioning in parts. An active and functioning temple with a great deal of beauty and history
,,So relaxing and peaceful,5.0,,"The temple is beautifully constructed and offers immense amount of peace to anyone who comes by. The people inside the temple were also very kind and even told us of a few traditions and what different things meant. For a great picture, come out of the complex after your tour and you can get a lot of pictures. It is situated in China town itself so after you’re done with this you can take a stroll around China Town and cover yet another great place in Singapore."
,,Must see attraction within Singapore's Chinatown,5.0,,"We visited this temple and were blown away by the amount of detail and time spent crafting this exquisite museum. Take your time walking through this temple, it was one of my favourite experiences when travelling through Singapore."
,,Stop over by Peaceful Moment,4.0,,We were on the way waking to China Town Heritage centre and found this place along the way. Thinking to just few minute stop but end up spend > 1/2 hr as we were amazed from spiritual activités activities at that time as well as impress with and beautiful design/architecture of building. Although the place is not that big but the arrangement full of detail yet neat.
,,A beautiful serene place,5.0,,Just today I have visited the serene place while I was at Chinatown. Nearest MRT was Chinatown mrt. The statue of Lord Buddha is unique and beautiful. The museums were great to see.
,,Terrific Temple,4.0,,"From the street, the temple doesn't look that big, but once you enter the gate and explore around, it is certainly very large with many intricate architecture and display. Remember to go up to the roof top floor to see the display and also the orchid garden."
,,Spritual Bliss,5.0,,"liked the aesthtic of the temple, each and every floor is well meant for different items of Lord Buddha etc"
,,What a shame the most interesting hall is under renovation.,3.0,,"Love to visit this site with visitors to Singapore, especially when it’s hot outdoor (and it’s always hot outdoor).

It’s serene and air conditioned. And the 3rd level has a very easy-to-navigate layout of the Buddha life. Too bad it was under renovation.....

Otherwise, the tooth relic and the big big bell on the roof top provide very interesting talking points...."
,,Good,5.0,,This is a must place to visit. There are robes and shawl available if you wear shorts or sleeveless tops. The walls are very decorative and the altars are colourful. You can light an incense stick outside or purchase different size candles or flowers to place on altar.
,,A Large Stately Buddhist Temple,4.0,,"This large temple is all decked out for the Chinese New Year which is approaching. It is located near China Town and the food courts. Don’t forget to see the Buddha tooth relics. If you are into temples, also check out the Hindu temple a few bliss away."
,,SUCH A PEACEFUL PLACE.,4.0,,I LOVE here feel so peace immiditely enter to temple.nice lunch have near by here.but trust me dont mis this place if you ever visit singapore.
,,If You Don't Like Taking Your Shoes and Socks Off Don't Go In,3.0,,"I enjoyed the experience of this temple, it was very busy with both tourists and worshippers. Very colourful and you are allowed to take photo's inside for a small fee $3 SGD but not of the actual prayer area as it is an active spiritual place.
To enter, you need to remove all footwear and leave with hundreds of others on the sidewalk in a designated area, or, if you have kids that were concerned by the whole scene(like ours), leave with them - lol."
,,A must see,5.0,,"My wife and I did the Monster free walking tour of Chinatown with Colin. While the whole tour was informative and interesting,for me the highlight was the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. There was a ceremony going on ,led by chanting monks and was quite busy, the temple was very beautiful and built with no nails being used."
,,Beautiful temple in the heart of China Town,4.0,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is located in the heart of China Town surrounded by great food places and souvenirs shops. The temple is an amazing place to understand more about the Buddhist culture. The average time to visit is about 1 hour.
,,A must see,5.0,,Beautiful Temple. You can spend as little or as long as you like in here. We were here for a very short while as the Singapore afternoon heat got to us
,,To find peace in the city,5.0,,"The Temple and Museum held amazing collection. It held many relics around Asia, a great way to learn buddhism. The top level garden way filled with great energy. You can also purchase small token from the shop that has been blessed by the monk."
,,stop by if you are in Chinatown,3.0,,"This temple is located in the Chinatown. However, I don't think that it's something you try to visit, so you can just stop by if you are already in Chinatown. Anyway you will visit Chinatown, so will here."
,,Best spot in Chinatown,5.0,,"I love this Temple even if is pretty turistic this place needs to be seen! It offers also a small museum at level 2 and on level 3 there is the Buddha tooth relic. Don't miss the top floor the roof with the garden is marvellous and very quiet.
For a zen journey!"
,,Authentic ceremonies,3.0,,One of the view temples where you can go in a take pictures while it’s happening. It’s got a centre piece for the monks and all who chant along. The sides of the temple are covered with mini buddhas. It’s a multi story building so you can take the elevator and go to the 4th floor. Nice to see and to take pictures.
,,Huge building,3.0,,"Can't miss the temple,right in the heart of Chinatown I did not go in but the outside had intricate designs a place you should find and visit while eating your way through Chinatown!"
,,Best Buddha Temple I have visited!,5.0,,Visited the temple during our visit to Singapore. The temple is very beautiful. The atmosphere is serene. It is one of the best maintained temples and lots of detailed intricate architecture elements. The colours are absolutely mesmerising. The volunteers and staff are very helpful. The whole experience is divine.
,,Family holidays,5.0,,"Beautiful place to visit. Interesting story behind. Was exited like a child to see it. If you are in Singapore, definitely one of the top destination!"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Spent about 20 minutes here, which was enough. We happened upon this place. There is some xplanation of the temple and displays inside. Not sure aperson needs to seek it out but certainly go in if you come across it"
,,Temple visit,4.0,,"It was a great experience there because you will get to see a lot of crafts inside the temple and the environment was very calming and beautiful!
Please do take note that you should dress appropriately such as no low V-neck, short skirt or shorts and no sleeveless. If you enter the place wearing too revealing, the in-charges will request you to wear a long cloth over provided by them.

Overall, the experience was good:)"
,,Historical interest,3.0,,"The BTRTM is a Chinese Buddhist temple in Singapore Chinatown. It is a multistory complex and is designed according to classical Chinese architecture. It serves both as an active temple in the Buddhist tradition, as well as a museum of Chinese history in Singapore. The temple area is beautifully adorned with sculptures of the Buddha in his various incarnations, as well as other deities and beings associated with Buddhistic tradition and mythology. There are depictions of crimes and punishments as is part of Chinese traditions. The museum is located on the upper levels. It describes key events in the early history of the Chinese community in Singapore, including the history of the temple itself. Photography is permitted. It is a good site to visit and, combined with the National Museum and the Peranakan Museum, gives a taste of Singapore's past. However, I did not get a feel for Buddhistic practices or teachings in this temple, as I felt that this place is fundamentally a tourist attraction."
,,Good Buddhist Temple,4.0,,"Beautiful and large temple that is easy to visit in the middle of Chinatown. Well worth the visit, do not miss the roof garden."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,Amazing gardens on the roof time with an impressive prayer wheel. Defintely worth the trip to see the gardens.
,,Incredible and for free!,5.0,,"This monster-pagoda has beautiful golden statues, a rooftop garden and interesting stories about Tibetan Budhism. A must-see!"
,,Enchanting,5.0,,Females are offered shawls if their shoulders are uncovered. Thousands of Buddha statues of varying sizes. Lots of gold. Worth a visit even if it's just for 15 minutes.
,,Interesting architecture + Accessible,5.0,,"My friend and I happened upon this temple while looking for the Chinatown Tourist Information Centre - we didn't know such a temple existed in Singapore and we certainly didn't know this temple was one of Chinatown's highlights. But we are glad we found it. Imagine our surprise when, while looking for a tourist office, we came across such a tall and grand-looking Buddhist temple instead!
It is rather easy to access, people just walked right in. If you're wearing shorts, you can grab a sarong-like garment from a designated box. We didn't go to the upper floors but we did walk around the ground floor, where we saw statues of various Buddhist deities that act as guardians for certain zodiac signs, as well as a large prayer hall.
I really like the temple building itself. Apparently it was built in the Tang dynasty architectural style, which explains why it appears a bit more subtle, minimalist and restrained compared to other Chinese-influenced temples in Southeast Asia."
,,A must see...,5.0,,"Any visit to Chinatown has to include this temple, staff very friendly and welcoming, with daily services."
,,Quick visit,3.0,,We stopped here while touring Chinatown and there is no English interpretation of what’s inside so we had no idea what we were seeing. Shoulders and knees must be covered but wraps are provided free for use. We looked inside and it is quite opulent but we left quickly not understanding what we were seeing.
,,A very peaceful experience,5.0,,"A lovely place to visit. Interesting. I do love how they have a tub out the front with scarves a skirt wraps so you can cover up and be respectful. We found ourselves there unplanned and I was wearing a tank top so I just needed to grap a scarf to wrap around my shoulders. The roof top is worth a visit, beautiful tranquil garden up there. Of course the tooth (i think from memory it is on level 4) is worth a visit too."
,,Free access,5.0,,Popped in while waiting on our transfer to go to the gardens. The men had to wear a long skirt to cover their knees. The place was busy with people reading in front of the main Buddha. A sight to behold and a lot smaller than expected. Worth a visit but you wouldn’t spend a lot of time in here.
,,Incredible words can't describe,4.0,,Words can't describe the beauty of this place. It is a must visit location. Even the kids were mesmerized.
,,WOW! Amazing!,5.0,,"I was a little apprehensive as I didn't know what to expect but I'm so glad I went in the end. This place was mind-blowing. It doesn't matter whether you're a buddhist or not, the inside of this temple is mesmerising. The detail that has gone into the decorations and figurines. Take the time to walk slowly around and admire the beauty of this place.
They are strict on what you are allowed to wear inside (particularly length of shorts and sleeves) but they do provide shawls if necessary to wrap over shoulders or wear as skirts."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,"Another must visit attraction. The temple is beautiful and is a busy temple in its own right. Its set in a busy china town area, which in itself is worth the trip here."
,,calm and peaceful place,5.0,,Very well maintained. One can enjoy the calmness of this holy place. The lift had long queue to see the tooth relic.
,,Beautiful and Enormous,5.0,,Gigantic shrine to Buddha easily located in a great part of Chinatown. I used this as my anchor and drop off point whenever I was traveling to chinatown. Inside is a beautiful Shrine which is very large and two sided. You can come in from one of two directions or just one direction to walk through and see both sides. Absolutely beautiful and a must see. Its even free!!
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to witness a service/ceremony (sorry, not sure of the correct terminology for Buddhism) and it was beautiful and fascinating to watch and listen to. The temple itself is beautiful and fascinating, just remember it IS a working temple, be respectful with the photography!"
,,One of the best Buddha temple,5.0,,"Quite a grand place and so so peaceful. It has 4 floors and small orchid garden on roof top. First floor has a huge Buddha statue and place to worship. There are around 10000 Buddha relic in this place.
There is a museum in one floor, a meditation floor
We spend 2-3 hrs here. It doesn’t really take that long ...probably an hour to seethe whole place. We just loved it so much we just stayed there"
,,Great place,5.0,,I go to this temple for solo visits especially for meditation on the 4 th floor where the tooth relic is . It’s a must visit if you are a tourist to Singapore it’s a great temple with lots of history in the museum on the 3rd floor and a great terrace garden on the roof .
,,Temple,5.0,,"Nice architecture, brilliantly carved , free entry , spent a lot of time looking at the carved statues . Excellent"
,,Stunningly Beautiful in the heart of Chinatown!!,5.0,,From the outset it looks like a Chinese temple placed in the hustle and bustle of Chinatown but nothing like that when you enter. Tens of thousands of Buddha decorations embellished the walls producing the most impressive imagery and quiet. It is also on 5 storeys with ancient artefacts and statues. Definitely not to be missed.
,,A place of respect,5.0,,"Wow, such a respectful place, the calmness and serenity as soon as you walk in. As a Buddhist I found myself so bless, such a place to meditate to calm yourself. An eye opener to a peaceful religion"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,We were fortunate to visit the temple during a ceremony. It was interesting and moving to watch. The sights and sounds were lovely.
,,Impressive inside architecture,4.0,,"Impressive temple but it is a bit overrated. If you have not seen the ones in China or India, this one could be interesting."
,,Fantastic Building,5.0,,The Buddha Temple is a great religious place for a visit. the inside is fllled with amazing artifacts and decorative Buddhas.
,,Well worth the visite,4.0,,"Calm, relaxing. Beautiful architecture, on the edge of Chinatown. Impressive introduction to Taoisme and Buddism."
,,Beautiful part of a different religion.,5.0,,"The temple is a multi story building with various floors for prayer, meditation and gaining general knowledge on the Buddhist faith in Singapore. Well worth the visit and if visiting Chinatown it should be on the list."
,,A very religious Red temple.,5.0,,"located in China town, this temple is an very good place to know abt buddhist temple rituals and Gods."
,,Amazing and a place to see!,5.0,,"Everytime that we have friends coming to Singapore, we always visit Chinatown and at the same time, it is a must to show them this beautiful and unique Temple!

We loved to see the 100 Budhas and spend time as it really transmit you peace!

Only five minutes located from Chinatown SMRT and no fee to be paid at the entrance; nevertheless it is nice to give a small donation or light a candle."
,,Fascinating Modern Temple,5.0,,"This Temple - like many others claim to have on display a tooth of Buddha. It is clearly on display in a gold clamp holder in a cased glass box. Unlike by comparison the Tooth Relic Temple in Kandy in Sri Lanka. This is on the 4th floor where all photography is prohibited.

The main entry hall is a regular temple. Second floor has lots of items related to Buddhism with especial reference to Singapore. Gives profiles of distinguished leaders - even some medals on display PBM.

Very educational. Allow at least an hour to go around here. The roof has a Tibetan prayer wheel - well worth a visit, enjoy.

As ever it is a privilege to see other religions at work. The world is grateful for the insight which leads to better understanding and increases hormone and tolerance of faiths."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,A very nice temple from the outside. Inside it is also nice but we was in and out within about 5 minutes. Worth seeing if you are in Chinatown
,,Informative,3.0,,Great information and insights into Buddha. This is a new temple of reconstruction. Well worth a visit and it’s free.
,,Very nice and relaxing place,5.0,,"Very close to China Town, this is very nice place and very relaxing, about short clothes ( you get small cloth to wear if you have come unplanned ) Very views and things to read, approx,. duration max. 30 min."
,,Beautiful architecture,4.0,,"On the edge of Chinatown, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is an impressive introduction to Taoism and Buddhism in general. Worth a few minutes stop and located next to the gathering point for many tour buses."
,,"Calm, Relaxing, Lovely building",5.0,,"A beautiful building in the heart of Chinatown. If you are wearing clothing above the knee or your shoulders are not covered you will need to wear a shawl (which they provide). What a wonderful collection of Buddha's on level 1 - we enjoyed finding the one's that related to our star sign' s. The Buddha tooth relic is on level 4 in an amazing room enshrined in gold, and don't miss the peaceful roof garden. The lift to the upper floors is hard to find - if you can't find it be sure to ask or you will definitely miss out."
,,A nice Buddhist Temple to see!,4.0,,"As I went to Chinatown with friends to show them around this part of the town. It was really nice to showed them the Sri Mariamman Temple and this one. Both of them can be shown in maximum two hours.

We did not take any tour guide but I think it is worth it to have someone who could explain you about the history of the Temples.

Very near from Chinatown SMRT and no need to pay to enter to both, only whatever you decide to donate if you wish."
,,Lovely place,4.0,,"Ladies cover your knees and shoulders, but if you haven’t there are shawls and wrap skirts you can use. It is a beautiful peaceful place no entry fee. The Buddha relic is obviously very sacred and housed in a gold alter. The roof top garden is also nice"
,,Impressive to see,5.0,,Be sure you are respectfully dressed (they will lend you a shawl) and act appropriately when you visit here. Very interesting to visit.
,,Must visit in Chinatown,5.0,,This temple and museum located right in the middle of Chinatown is the main attraction. It is definitely worth visiting to learn about Buddhism.
,,One of the best Buddhist temples in a major city,5.0,,"While certainly not a historically critical site in the way some shrines in China or Tibet or Myanmar are, for a temple in a modern city, this is a tremendous resource for Buddhism studies and history. The ground floor rooms are large and well appointed with wonderfully rich, multi-story Buddha statues as well as study tables for monks as well.

Donations are voluntary but with the security, loving care of the monks, air conditioning, and the right to burn incense and request an invocation, this is a very small price to pay.

Make sure to visit the upper fooors. Most tourists do not seem to be aware of the option to do so. The reliquary is absolutely beautiful and meditation by visitors is allowed. There are also roof gardens, prayer wheels, a small museum with various Buddhist artifact displays and some background on Buddhist deities and non deity personalities, as well as some history about Singapore.

The whole site is well maintained an appointed. A full review of the site could take 45 minutes if you move quickly or a bit longer if you linger as we did in the reliquary.

Just off Chinatown’s tourist areas, this is much more important for those seeking a more educational or cultural experience. It is also opposite a large building that serves as the wet market and also a major food hawkers site, so very easy to make a morning or afternoon of it."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The relic room is the absolute masterpiece of this building. Unfortunately, they do not permit pictures in there, but it is extremely ornate and made the visit completely worth it. If you go during a service, it is quite relaxing to hear the chanting."
,,Interesting Temple,4.0,,"Although built recently, it is well endowed with interesting artifacts, some in a small museum. Explore the temple, visit the museum and see the small roof garden"
,,Purification,5.0,,"A must visit for Buddhist & tourists. Free entrance but please be in decent outfit. There are security near the entrance to assist you to be in decent attire by offering you free 'cover-up' before you enter the temple. Five levels of Buddhism experience awaits you. See for yourself. I particularly like the meditation level where you're free to meditate, read & contemplate on your spirituality & life."
,,Gold and red and commercial,3.0,,"Located in Chinatown and admission is free. Unlike the traditional temples, it is new with lots of ornaments and statues in glittering gold colour. It felt very commercial.

We went at around 10:30 am on a weekday and although there were many people on the first floor, the other floors were relatively quiet. The roof garden was a breath of fresh air.

Spent less than half an hour there."
,,July 2017,5.0,,A must see!! Absolutely stunning and extremely peaceful on the top floor.I love this temple! Lots to see and admire. Good cheap veg food served in the basement definitely worth a try too.
,,Nice place in Singapore,5.0,,The location of this place is good. Can travel by MRT. The place very nice decorations. Recommend you to go.
,,spirtual,4.0,,"a beautiful well maintained temple in the middle of chinatown,leaves you awestruck. a must visit when in singapore.statues of various guardian angels according to buddhist belief are an opener."
,,A fascinating tour,4.0,,It's interesting to have a look at religious practices other than your own. Take the elevator up to the rooftop where you'll find worshippers walking around a prayer wheel. The temple art is detailed too. The museum was closed for renovations when i visited. The temple is air conditioned so you can always walk in to cool off on a hot day and enjoy the calm inside or the rhythmic hum of worshippers. Donations are welcomed.
,,Peaceful Place,5.0,,It is definitely worth a visit to the Temple (even if the Buddha Tooth Relic) cannot be viewed. The ornate decorations are beautiful and the gardens on the rooftop are truly peaceful. I was lucky enough to enjoy the chanting as well.
,,Tranquill with respect,5.0,,The building was beautiful with beautiful 3 big statue inside. The poeple were stopping by for short pray and the atmosphere was tranquillizing.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is such a beautiful temple. We didn't get to see it all, but it was an amazing place to visit and very moving."
,,Fascinating Buddhist temple,5.0,,A must visit when in Singapore Chinatown. This working temple is splendid in its architecture and colour. And of course visiting the Buddha Tooth is a must when at the temple.
,,A fascinating glimpse of spirituality,5.0,,"Entering the temple, the eyes feasted on beautifully grown flowering potted plants. The sounds of monks and disciples chanting drifted outdoors. Further in to the temple we were fascinated by the many statues of deities, all different, and the explanations accompanying many.
The temple had a spiritual feel about it as a living temple, despite some commercial aspects which help fund the cost of running it.
Well worth a visit."
,,Solemn place,4.0,,"Ladies must put on scarves & long dresses to cover up their shoulders & legs if you’re wearing camisole, shorts & mini skirt. This is solemn place to keep in quiet, not recommend if you have kids or infants. With lifts for elderly"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,My knowledge of Buddhism is relatively limited so I was interested to see this temple. Preferable to turn up with shoulders and legs (above the knee) covered but shawls will be provided. There are 4 floors and a rooftop area also. Plenty can be learnt about the Buddhist faith here and I would say it is well worth a visit. Quite peaceful in various parts despite being right in the centre of town.
,,A very friendly and serene place,5.0,,"We visited when the monks were chanting and I asked if I was allowed to take pictures. They said yes, of course and it was no problem. It was so beautiful to hear them and the inside of this temple is just stunningly beautiful. Well worth a visit, whatever your religious views."
,,peaceful and serene,5.0,,the guides were knowledgeable and pleasant. the surroundings are truly breath taking and very holy. We enjoyed our visit.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,Nice tranquil temple with a lot of buddhas. At the time we visited there were only few people at the same time (saturday morning).
,,Interesting temple,3.0,,One of many interesting temples in Singapore. Worth a visit if you're in the area but I wouldn't go especially.
,,amazing inside,5.0,,There is so much gold and things of interest inside. You can take photos and there are people to ask questions of.
,,You have to go here until pm 05:30,3.0,,"There opens until pm 07:00. But you can see the buddha's tooth until pm 05:30.
As you get closer to pm 06:00, they do not open the gate to there.
I have visited here at pm 05:50, they closed the gate.
It was not yet pm 06:00, but they did not open it.
Besides, shop closes at pm 06:00.
They just open 1st floor until pm 07:00.
If you go here, you have to go here until pm 05:30."
,,A very interesting visit,5.0,,"This was a good choice of an activity as I am interested in Buddism. We enjoyed this place and would recommend. I covered my shoulders and legs by wearing light scarves, you can bring your own or staff will offer these to you if you are wearing shorts, etc. You should not really take pictures of the tooth inside, but I noticed some people doing this. I felt that it was enough to see and experience it first hand. I would recommend visiting here."
,,A modern Budha temple,3.0,,"A modern Budha temple, short time stop-by is enough for look around and knew more about their history. A Garden on the rooftop can keep yr step a little. A place to come in China town for quite moment."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Not only is this a very well maintained temple with some striking architecture - it is also the gateway to Chinatown so pop along make an offering then enjoy a walk around the neighbourhood.
,,Beautiful Buddhist Temple.,5.0,,"We visited this temple having just left Chinatown. What a wonderful place. We were lucky enough to witness Buddhist monks carrying out a service.
The temple is huge & displays various icons statues of gods In the rear of the temple is a large stage which displays colourful Buddhist deities in spectacular bright colours.
Well worth a visit whilst visiting Chinatown."
,,Right in the Heart of Chinatown,4.0,,A museum that doesn’t charge. There are plenty of history here including some relics and artifacts. There was a prayer service while we were there. That was nice to experience. The temple is a must see with its location at the heart of Chinatown.
,,Recommend this place!,4.0,,"The temple which was big- many statues of Buddha and colorful place, was near Chinatown. So it was easy to go and there was may restaurant near this temple."
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,How can so many places in Singapore be free to look at? This temple was fascinating to look round and lovely that photography was allowed. Really enjoyed the visit and it was a great addition to the walk around China Town ( thanks to Lonely Planet guide book).
,,Stunning Temple,5.0,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore, peaceful, tranquil and full of meaning. The outside does not give you the impression of the beauty or splendor that you see when you enter the temple. For people of other faiths this gives a great insight into Chinese Buddism and its mystisism. The silk backdrops are beautiful as are the carvings and statues. A peaceful oasis in an otherwise chaotic setting."
,,Impressive temple that is well kept with gold everywhere,5.0,,"Most Chinese temples have a dark soot filled interior from years of burning incense, but this temple has great ceiling lighting that keeps the place well lit and makes the gold statues and wall decorations sparkle. The buddha tooth relic is located on the fourth floor inside a large gold structure. Unfortunately photos are not allowed. Above the fourth floor is the roof garden with a small temple in the middle housing the prayer wheel. On the third floor is a museum on the buddha religion. On the second floor you can get a birds eye view of the main temple below. The best way to navigate the place is to view the main hall first and then take the elevator up to the fourth floor and then walk your way down as you visit each floor. The elevator is a little bit difficult to find. It is located to the right before you enter the main hall. The temple is also quite impressive looking on the outside as well."
,,Buddha tooth relic,3.0,,"Remember that this is a sacred place. Taking photo is prohibited in some areas and proper dress code is required to go in. In case your attire is not appropriate, you can always ask for a showl at the entrance like what I did. There are souvenirs available inside."
,,Heritage walkabout,5.0,,Visited a series of temples during our walkabout and this temple was superbly constructed and stood out as one of our top temple highlights. Everything was immaculately laid out and it was so serene and peaceful on the upper level.
,,Nice building and awesome decoration inside,4.0,,We were walking by and gave ourselves the opportunity to visit this temple. It's very beautiful outside and more beautiful inside. We didnt spend too much time there though it worth it and we were happy to visit it.
,,Drive By,4.0,,We were on the Hop On Hop off bus and this is one of the bus stops. I love the contrast between the older classic and historic architecture versus the surrounding modern buildings and designs. Things have really changed over the years. In the future most of these will become and already are museums.
,,Surprising Find,4.0,,"I wasn't expecting much from this venue, but it was excellent. The sumptuous decoration, the history & the orchid gardens on the top made it an enjoyable visit."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"This place is absolutely beautiful, lots of details and I would recommend that if you are in Singapore to visit."
,,Something else,5.0,,"This temple is located in little India which is in itself a very special place. Some might find both of them kitschy but that’s what makes it so picturesque : it’s very colored, very crowded, noisy, but likable. It’s very different from all you might have seen anywhere else, unless you’ve been to India. There are always a lot of people wandering inside,outside and around the temple. It’s like entering, visiting and exiting India in 2 hours.Everything is very colorful inside the temple, all the walls are full of little Buddhas in different posture. Thousands of them ! A visit to the temple and little India,
can give you the feeling of India, without going to India. I loved it and I recommend a visit to both the temple and little India. There are a lot of restaurants, small shops,gold shops, toy shops,henna tattoo shops, it’s like a walk in a huge mall, always overcrowded but mysteriously not annoying.
I don’t think a lot of people like crowded
places but these two, worth trying, even so."
,,What an amazing Temple,5.0,,If you're planning a visit to Chinatown do not miss a visit to this Temple. There are thousands of small buddhas as well as the main temple on the 4th floor which is stunning.

,,Beautiful Temple and very visitor friendly,5.0,,The temple interior is colorful and reverent. Great photo opportunities here and restrooms. Located in the midst of Chinatown
,,Absolutely stunning detail.,5.0,,"Beyond happening upon the temple in the middle of a service (very cool to see and hear), the detail of the Buddha figures is stunning. There are hundreds, if not thousands, and each is its own work of art. No worries if you're not dressed conservatively as they offer garments to cover the necessary parts too respectfully enter the temple. Walk all the way through and you'll walk right into a huge market as well."
,,A nice temple,5.0,,"The temple is like another temples, with incense, statues, candles, prayers and all. It is relaxing to walk around the temple, not only that the building is nice but the whole ambience is calming."
,,Beautiful Temple w/ rooftop garden,5.0,,"Located @ the end of the main street in Chinatown, the temple is open to the public from 7am-7pm. If you are wearing shorts/skirts (even just a bit above the knees), you (male/female) will be asked to put on a wrap sarong-type skirt found at the entrances. Tank tops/cami exposed shoulders also under wraps.

Interesting to observe monks & followers chanting in the large conference room. Lots of gold and ornate. Take the elevator to the roof top garden to see the orchids and the giant prayer wheel."
,,Stupendously beautiful,5.0,,"When you enter the temple you are transported into another dimension, You can feel the peace and tranquility surround you. The smell of mild incense wafts thru the air giving you an elevated feeling"
,,Lots of gold,3.0,,I wouldn't go out of my way to see this but if you are interested in temples then this is quite a new one. You can go to the top and see the massive prayer wheel too. No photos allowed inside the inner sanctuary.
,,A must see in China Town,5.0,,"Loved the temple- right in the heart of China Town- free to enter, amazing history and loved walking around. There is lots of construction around so slightly hard to get to across some streets- go early and enjoy the food market across the way!"
,,Excellent temple in Chinatown!,4.0,,"Very cool architecture and roof lines on this building. The colors are amazing. We also liked the statues out front. We did not go inside, but enjoyed looking at all the detail outside."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Loved spending time here. So peaceful and informative. Easy to get to. Very large and shops etc nearby.
,,A Wonderful Site Full of History,5.0,,"If you are looking for a wonderful place to visit in Singapore, I highly recommend this Temple. It is first of all FREE and in the Chinatown District. It is full of history and the wonderful artifacts are really a site to see. Every tourist coming to Singapore must see this temple. Warning, for those female visitors, make sure that your shoulders are fully covered and no shorts. It is disrespectful to enter the temple with shorts or sleeveless shirt for male or female. This place goes all the way to the 5th floor where the garden is situated. There is a mezzanine that can be accessed via the stairs and not through the elevators. I really enjoyed visiting this temple."
,,Grand,5.0,,"A colorful sanctuary, places to meditate. Many different Buddhas inside. Great cultural experience right in Chinatown."
,,Enriching cultural experience,4.0,,"Buddhism's fusion with Chinese culture is an exciting to learn, mostly because it was amazing to see different buddha according to specific zodiac signs. The museum is spectacular in that it provides a pantheon overview of this belief. The structure and design inside are intricately detailed."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,its really worth taking a look. Unfortunately it was very busy when we were there and one needs to take your time to soak it all in.
,,"Amazing, serene location",5.0,,"This was the first time I ever visited a Buddhist Temple. The experience did not disappoint. Firstly, there is no admittance fee, which is nice - you can donate if you wish.
The place is quite big, with lots of things to see and experience. The actual temple is amazing: imposing statues and interesting architecture definitely catch your eyes. I am not familiar with Buddhist customs, however, it was really interesting to witness one of the ceremonies taking place there. There are 3 floors dedicated to Buddhism history which I believe are equally interesting for both Buddhist and Non-Buddhist individuals. The artifacts are beautiful, the atmosphere is relaxing and serene. The floor where the tooth of Buddha is held is a place of meditation and quiet introspection; monks chanting gives a sense of calmness and overall serenity. As a ""bonus"" the garden on top of the temple lets you further immerse in the calmness of this place.
Loved the experience and learned something new that day."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,Located in chinatown. Nice temple and quite compact. There were some buddhist monks chanting which added to the peacefulness of the place. We understand that there is a nice vegetarian cafe in the building.
,,A temple with air condition,4.0,,"This old temple was beautifully refurbished under a huge budget and it is fully air conditioned. Located in the heart of Chinatown. Plan at least an hour or so for the visit. Don’t forget the museum located within the temple. There is no entrance fee. There is a little nice roof garden nested on the top floor of this temple. After the visit, go to the Chinatown food center next to it and enjoy plenty of nice local food."
,,Buddha Temple,5.0,,Situated in Chinatown this is well worth a visit.You might think just another temple but this is really beautiful inside and even though it can be crowded there is a feeling of serenity and peacefulness there.

,,Calming short temple tour,4.0,,"Nice quick temple visit, Buddha and variation, Kwan Yin and other goddesses. There were monks about to start prayers during a morning visit around 10.30am on Wednesday."
,,Absolutely breathtaking,5.0,,Visited here in November 2017 whilst on holiday in Singapore. The exterior of the temple is stunning but was completely blown away by the interior! Ornate and absolutely beautiful. Whilst I visited a ceremony was being performed and it was fantastic to see the monks performing their religious services. It is my favourite place that I visited whilst in Singapore. Do not miss it.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Buddha tooth is out of this world stunning! I have visited many places of worship around the world and this by far is the most beautiful one I have ever had the pleasure of stepping into. Don't worry if you come in not the right attire as there are sarongs and shawls at the entrance (free of charge). There are also bowls of coins which you can purchase and walk around the temple putting a coin in each bowl. I am assuming each bowl is for a different god? Unfortunately I didn't see this till the end which I was a bit bummed about. They also run guided tours which is awesome if you want to learn a bit about the religion, etc. DO NOT MISS VISITING THIS PLACE"
,,STOP BY WHEN IN CHINATOWN,3.0,,"Unless you're a Buddhist, I would only visit this Temple when you're already in Chinatown

I took 3 tourists there recently and noticed their interest drop.

Not for everyone, but ok for a 30 minute visit.

Try the free (donations welcome) vegetarian meal on certain days and hours."
,,Lovely visit,5.0,,My niece and I were walking to China town where the temple is located. A gentleman offered to show us around. I personally have visited many temples in the east. This won was small full of spiritual atmosphere. We were taken around and given a very full detailed history of the temple. The person found our birth Buddhas. A lovely way to spend an hour and would recommend it.
,,Holidays,3.0,,My gosh so lovely to see spent a time there just was unreal to see look at all inside don't miss seeing
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Lovely peaceful tranquil walk around temple A very beautiful place Garments available for women to cover your knees and shoulders

Since prayer services are likely to be underway.. it's advisable to wear dresses commensurate with it.

The temple is very impressive, featuring multiple floors of buddha statues."

,,Temple,4.0,,Have a serene area within the business street of Chinatown. Show of interesting statue of the mahayana buddhiam where on the top floor.. Sometime open.. U get to see. Statue made of real gold from the donation of devotee n followers
,,Definitely recommend a stop to active and beautiful temple,5.0,,Nicely air conditioned which may not seem like much but in Singaporean weather it feels wonderful for a temporary escape the temple is awe inspiring. I got to observe a ceremony. I recommend you go up to the 2nd floor to see museum and 4th floor to see actual tooth relic which the space itself is jaw dropping but no pictures allowed. Go up to the roof to see the large Tibetan Prayer Wheel and a great view. Didn’t get a chance to but the basement is supposed to served wonderful vegetarian food. Definitely recommend a visit especially in conjunction with Chinatown or on Indie Chinatown walking tours. If wearing sleeveless or shorts they will have shawls for you to cover up.
,,Nice Buddhist temple,4.0,,A very nice Buddha temple of Maitreya Buddha - the future Buddha. Located in Chinatown. Calm serene and scenic.
,,"Serene, spiritual and very ornate",4.0,,"Quite a contrast between the simple haunting chanted “service” and opulent surroundings. Good idea to take lift/stairs to roof and see the huge prayer wheel then work your way down taking in the golden stupa containing the tooth and the mezzanine with lifelike wax images of various holy men.
Free admission and no pressure to buy anything. Well worth a 30 to 60 min visit."

,,Majestic Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"Went to Tooth Relic Temple to pray for our family good health. This is one of the most majestic furnished temple you can find in Singapore. It is situated at the heart of Chinatown just right in front of Chinatown Complex.

Even as early as 6.30am, there are Buddhist streaming into the temple to pray. When you step into the temple you will be awe by how majestic and lited it is. You feel comfortable and safe there. As you stroll into the temple you will see a huge Buddha statue and other Bodhisattvas. Each Bodhisattvas safeguard 2-3 Chinese horoscopes.

It is surely a nice place to visit while you indulge yourself in Chinatown."

,,Amazing! Simply Amazing!,5.0,,"You can't pass up an opportunity to miss this Temple.

From the moment you enter the complex until you leave you are surrounded by a huge sensory overload.

Soak it all in and don't miss the many representations of Buddah located in the far rear of the Temple as well.

Buy 100 coins and make prayers and wishes as you drop a coin into each of 100 plates located in front of various Buddahs.

Don't forget to light some incense sticks and insert them into the giant cauldron in front of the Temple.

Also interesting to see classes being taught in an open forum and prayers being sung as well."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Centrally located and easy to find. Atmospheric temple that is not only for tourists - thought there are lots of tourists. Be sure to go to the top floors fir the tooth relic and outdoor garden/terrace - lots of steps but worth it.
,,A very unique experience,5.0,,"This was one of the things I realy wanted to see for a cultural perspective. You do need to be respectful and adhere to clothing requirements (particualry females).

,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Beautiful temple to walk through, we spent less than 30 mins here but you can just walk straight in from one end to the other very easily. Free entry and no queues.

You have to step over a small step to enter and we did not see any ramps for wheelchair or push chair access, however this may be because the corridors in the temple are too narrow."
,,"Interesting, contemplative, beautiful",5.0,,"A couple of floors, 2 and 3, are dedicated to sharing knowledge and artefacts. Excellent museum. The rest of the building is dedicated to spiritual activities. Very peaceful, beautiful and spiritual. Be sure to visit the roof garden after the Buddha Tooth Relic on the 4th floor."

,,Thought Provoking,5.0,,This Buda temple is full of historical artifacts and information. It also allegedly holds a Buda's tooth. Well worth a visit. Women - take a shawl with you if you choose to wear something that doesn't wear your shoulders and they like you to also have your knees covered. They do provide sarongs and shawls but you might want to use your own. Also on the 4th for you need to remove your shoes before entering into the room.

,,Don't miss this fascinating Temple in Chinatown,5.0,,Our taxi driver in Singapore recommended we visit the Temple when in Chinatown. It was absolutely amazing. Words can't describe the experience. All I can say is we are so delighted we went. It's free to enter but for $10 you get a bowl of coins to that value which you can use to offer up prayers to the various Guardian Deities. The prayer wheel on the top floor is the biggest in the world.
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,This is perhaps the most popular landmark of Singapore. The temple is truely gorgeous. If you happen to be there during prayer time the ambience of hte temple is really beautiful It is very serene and peaceful despite the bustle around.
,,Typical Temple with a lot of buddhas,3.0,,Although this building is fairly new it is interesting. There are many buddhas here for sponsorship. This put me off a little. But the overall feel is interesting. I get that it is a cultural thing but the pressure to sponsor felt more like a marketing ploy than a religious thing. They have a clean water fountain area where you can refill your water bottle for free!
,,Amazing temple,5.0,,"WOW this is really such an amazing temple. From the outside of the facade I could see the grandeur and solemnity of the temple; stepping inside, I was more impressed not only by its spirituality but also by its subtle and unique design, which made the temple unique. This is a great place to visit."

The architecture of the building is beautiful looks like a picture from a book. We visited at a time when they were about to start some sort of special prayer and meditation. Inside is absolutely beautiful, you're not allowed to go to certain areas but you can stand and watch.

When you go please show respect if they're praying. I will recommend this place as a must see if in Signapore."
,,Wonderful temple,5.0,,A must visit place if in Chinatown. From the outside it looks like a normal Chinese Buddhist temple but once inside it is anything but ordinary. The decor and the glitter inside is mesmerizing and the statues and carvings on the wall are very detailed. The temple also has a solid gold Buddha statue inside which is the main attraction.
,,BREATHTAKING!,5.0,,"Beautiful, relatively new temple housing a 53 million dollar solid gold Buddha. It is the hub of Chinatown life and the area around it filled with great food and shopping."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,This is a beautiful temple. We lucked out and were there during the prayers. The one knock is the elevators to upper floors are slow and small.
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,Lovely detail and beautifully laid out. If you have time to spare go for a look. We enjoyed the detail and color.
,,Temple with a rooftop orchid garden,4.0,,We went to this temple one rainy morning. It's a smaller temple on several floors. Our young nephews and niece were with us and it was a good tour of a bud dish temple for them. They supplied sarongs to wrap around us ladies wearing shorts. There is a lovely orchid garden on the rooftop with one of those big prayer spinning wheels.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"It doesn’t matter whether you’re a person of faith or not this place is worth a visit just for the sheer beauty and artistry on display. Over the past couple of weeks insuring Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore, I’ve visited many temples but this is the to of the list. Simply breathtaking."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,The temple is beautiful. Its colourful and a lot of attention has gone into the details. The entry is free and you are allowed to take pictures inside.
,,Highly respected Buddha temple,4.0,,To build relic temple buddha many singaporeans offer their own personal gold to this temple for contribution.
,,Must go Budhist temple,4.0,,This place is so colorful and very picturesque. There is a orchid garden on the terrace. There are 12000 small buddha statue on on the terrace.1st floor and 4th Floor are must see. tooth relic is on 4th floor. Very beautiful
,,Buddha Temple,5.0,,"It is right inside China Town and the next street is where all the souvenir and food shops are there.

It is beautiful Buddhist temple and they allow photography which I have noticed Buddhist temples in India do not allow. The structure is beatiful and the statue grand. It is worth visiting there."
,,If in Chinatown please visit,3.0,,"If you're into temples, this is a good place to visit. Didn't take the tour, just roamed around inside quietly and made my way out without causing too much noise."
,,All things Buddha,5.0,,"We've always left this off the list but decided to visit. Luckily we were there during a prayer meeting and the atmosphere was great. The ground floor is intereresting with the deities, but upstairs, where the tooth relic is ( hard to see) is overwhelmingly ornate. Be conscious this is sacred and people are praying and meditating here; hated to see tourists doing the ugly thing of chattering"
,,Amazing temple,4.0,,Very scenografic temple...expecially in the night when lights exalt its facade..good visit and good district
,,Peaceful place in China Town,5.0,,The temple is peaceful. This place is a museum itself. On the 4th floor there's a place to do meditation. Also there's a rooftop garden which is beautiful and calm. Elevator is provided.
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,Easy to find. Really interesting inside and stunning displays on every floor. You can spend a good hour here looking at everything!
,,Nice to shoot pictures,4.0,,Nice place to visit and capture some nice pictures. A great architecture and a vibrant looking place
,,Peace in the city,5.0,,"We stumbled across this temple during a visit to Chinatown and am so glad we did. This temple is free to enter and you won't regret it, the detailed chambers and beauty throughout the temple are not to be missed, the orchid garden on the roof is also fantastic. They also have a clean restroom."
,,Quite incredible,4.0,,"This temple is so colourful, spiritual and something you don’t see everyday. You have to take your shoes off so don’t be alarmed and walk inside. Women will be given something to cover their shoulders to walk inside and there is a 3 dollar camera fee to take photos."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Its amazing to see the structure that has been built around a very small relic. It is a place of worship and very beautiful - only issue we had was that if you use the stairs instead of the lift from the fourth floor where the main relic is, you end up out on the street and no where near the box where the borrowed shawl needs to be returned so you have to make the trek all the way back to the front."
,,Worth a visit if you're in Chinatown,4.0,,"This is a really beautiful little temple, situated in the middle of Chinatown. It's free to enter and worth a visit if you're in the area. It contains hundreds of Buddha statues and sometimes you can catch a religious service or festival. Make sure to go upstairs to see the relic itself. Even further up, on the roof, is an enormous prayer wheel. If you're in shorts of tank tops, you'll need to borrow a covering and do make sure to be quiet. The staff are super friendly. I'd say the whole thing will take 20-30 minutes to see. If you're in search of food afterwards, the hawker centre in Hong Lim Complex is cheaper and more authentic than the stalls on Pagoda street. Cash only, closes around 3pm."
,,A place for worship and some selfie,5.0,,"Primarily a place of worship, but it's amazing how the wood carvings have been preserved. It's easily accessible by public transport and is near restaurants. It's a good side trip for people visiting china town as it's close by."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Very peaceful and well maintained. Find peace amid the soulful chants. If you are interested in Buddhist culture, you'll find the museum interesting and informative."
,,Small nice temple with 1000 of Buddhas around,5.0,,"It is a small, but very nice temple decorated in gold. Situated in the chinease part of town. At the entrance, in case you have dressed shorts/ mini rocks, you get a sarong. In some of the rooms it is not allowed to take pictures. Closed to the Sri Mariamman temple (the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore) and the maxwell food market. So you can combine the visit. Well we also visited in Sri Lanka another tooth relic temple, and in both temple we didn't see any teeth..."
,,I'm not a religious man but this is utterly impressive.,5.0,,"The smell of incense, the bells chiming, chanting to a rhythm, praying, offerings. The discipline just absorbed me. Being of military background this appealed to me. I was in awe of it all. What an experience. I respect all religions and visited many temples while in the far east. Just be respectful of others. Whoa, that was deep lol. Anyway, worth a visit if you are in the area and like the cultural thing."
,,A Delightful Surprise in Chinatown,5.0,,While most people head to Chinatown for the food street and shopping the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was a delightful surprise. It is beautiful and welcoming. Don't forget to go to the 4th level where the relic is kept. There is also earmarked space for meditation and prayers. Loved the Orchid garden and prayer wheel on the rooftop.
,,The Budha cult,4.0,,"We were there with a lot of respect and dignity to the religion of Budha. Very clean , nice smell. Top place."
,,It is a Destination by itself,5.0,,"This temple is more than a temple per se, there is more to it than meet the eyes. When visiting the temple, one should set aside at least 3 hours to explore all the different floors.

We arrived at the ground floor and pay our homages to the Gods, then we go straight up to the 5th floor open air garden.

5th Floor - take a lift to the 4th floor and turn left to take stairs, go straight up to the rooftop garden. It is like a sanctuary, with a central building that houses a large Tibetan scripture spinning wheel.

4th Floor - this is where the sacred tooth relic is stored in, you can't go in to the main shrine but you can view behind glass panels.

3rd Floor - Museum with a storyline of Buddha life and a gallery to show the different type of Buddha icons from all over the world.

2nd Floor - Another Buddhist Artifact Gallery showcasing Buddhism art and crafts.

M Floor - Viewing Gallery of the ground floor prayers ritual and many wax figures of important Buddhist Monks from around Asia.

Ground Floor - this is main hall with the main deities.

We enjoy the trip to this temple very much, it is definitely a must visit when in Singapore."
,,Truely amazing,5.0,,"A very quiet, beautiful, decorative place in china town. Visit the fourth floor to see the tooth stowed. Excellent place for meditation. Photos are allowed in the ground floor"
,,Stunning temple,5.0,,Great serene place to visit. Gives a good insight into culture and history. Make sure you go up to level 4 and also the orchid garden.
,,An in-depth experience of Buddhism!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, it will be great to make a trip to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum in Chinatown. What will greet you as you near the temple will be its remarkable architectural style that is reminiscent of Buddhist temples in Kyoto, Japan. The colour red (which often stands for auspiciousness within Chinese culture) also stands out. At the entrance, depending on which entrance you are at (Note: there are two), you will see Maitreya Buddha at the main entrance, and the Goddess of Mercy at the other entrance. This is a place where many tourists take photos for remembrance and one of the locations to get great photos. You can take the lift or the stairs to other floors of the temple to have a look. Other attractions on these floors include the exhibition of the Buddha tooth itself, as well as other Buddhist relics in the museum. There is also a rooftop garden where you can take photos as well. The staff and volunteers are very friendly and you can seek their kind assistance should you have any queries or questions about Buddhism and its culture. Have an enjoyable experience!

NOTE: Please note that in the event that you are not dressed appropriately (such as wearing shorts), you will be asked to cover yourself with a shawl that is available at the entrance. You can ask for assistance if you do not know how to use it."
,,"Worth a look, nice building friendly people",4.0,,"Not something that I would normally choose to see, but it was a nice experience whilst passing. Worth a quick stop."
,,Impressive temple with Buddha statue overload,4.0,,"Impressive temple; the building itself but especially the interior. The tooth relic room is beautifully decorated, but what impresses most is the enormous collection of small and large Buddha statues. Do not miss the garden with the prayer wheel. Dress appropriately."
,,Beautiful temple,3.0,,This temple can be visited while taking a walk in Chinatown. Its a beautiful attraction and has a local feel to it
,,truly memorable,5.0,,"visited during the ghost festival and lots of people were prayer time, very busy, lovely temple showing some very old artefacts"
,,Well worth a look,3.0,,Well worth a look. I spent a good couple of hours walking around the museum and temple. A lot to take in and plenty to take photos of.
,,Interesting first visit to a Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"Stopped in during services. Buddhist monks chanting and the congregants repeating their prayers. Very beautiful architecture. In the mezzanine, there are life sized wax sculptures of present and past leaders of the Temple - amazing detail, with most looking like the leaders were just resting in place. The relic is surrounded by some 300 kg of gold donated by benefactors and members of the congregation.

Not to be missed."
,,Outstanding temple,5.0,,"The most beautiful and attractive temple in Singapore. Getting here from Pagoda street is easy and takes 5 minutes walk. The temple is free to visit and it has 5 floors. Fascinating is the the museum with all the Buddha images and the meditation room; is open buttake off your shoes and be quiet! After that you can eat in Maxwell Food centre, 10 minuted away."
,,Different to what we're used to.,4.0,,Extremely long walk up a steep hill to the temple. The temple was nice but the walk made me want a greater reward for my effort. The temple is orname but I wouldn't describe it as splendid. I am glad that I did it but if you don't fancy a very long and difficult walk then perhaps find something else to do in Singapore.
,,Peaceful,5.0,,Even though there were quite a lot of people it was very peaceful. Floor after floor of information and statues. Really pretty
,,Nice to see,3.0,,Lovely temple right in the heart of the city. Nice to wander through and get an understanding of Buddhism and the history behind the temple.
,,Wonderful Buddhist Temple in Chinatown,5.0,,"This is a don't miss attraction in Chinatown to me. A short walk from the MTR as well.

Clean, vibrant, lots to see and experience. Many worshipers there and loads of tourists. Also, just two blocks from Maxwell Street Hawker center. Free admission.

Make sure to see the whole place, there are two entrances with very different appearances, both worth some photos. Also, in the main room, the altar is quite stunning.

The place is also worth walking around completely on the outside, there are some great photo ops from outside and from across the street too.

This is a new complex completed in 2007, ten years ago, so it is really modern in and of itself, and surely when contrasted with the old places nearby. The building has places for prayers of course, places to meditate, a theater, museum gift shop and even a tea house. Also checkout the peaceful rooftop garden of this five story building.

Worth the time to visit and explore, some great photo ops there also both inside and of the exterior."
,,Great Temple. A must.,5.0,,"If you don't have much time, I would recommend prioritising this Temple. Dress modestly and you should be fine and they have sarongs to borrow and so on if you need them to enter. Once you've visited the main hall, be sure to take the stairs or the lift up to the other floors. There are further rooms and a beautiful roof top garden. The actual tooth is housed above the main room as well I think, so make sure you leave around an hour or so (if you want to take in the detail, it could probably stretch into 1h30). Really amazing.

The only downside is that you do feel a little like you're intruding into someone's religious space. I didn't enter one room as it appeared that some ritual was going on, for example. Overall, definitely go and see it!"
,,Amazing and free,5.0,,"On the ground floor has some amazing hand made silk tapestries, carved Buddha's and dragons. The forth floor (elevator available) is where you can find the tooth relic but it is hidden away behind copious amounts of gold and glass that prevent you getting a good look. There is some amazing detail in the work surrounding the tooth. Apparently there are specific days where the tooth is brought closer to the glass. Also, if using the toilets here, the toilet paper needs to be collected prior to entering the stall."
,,Stunning Temple,5.0,,Visited with my son. Stunning architecture. Fortunately when we visited there was a ceremony taking place which added to the atmosphere of the place. You were able to take photos and stand and watch the service too. If you want to see an authentic part of Chinatown this is a must. Highly recommend.
,,Buddhist Temple in China Town,4.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is located in China Town and has a very nice architecture in contrast to the surrounding buildings in China Town. The entrance is free and one can experience serenity and peace once inside the temple. Also do be mindfull to keep silence in deference to the people praying here.
,,Good to visit near Chinatown,3.0,,"It's a small, cozy and beautiful temple near Chainatown. Easy walk from MRT.
Inside is very peaceful and most of the times devotees are offering prayers.
To get better photo of the temple, you need to go to other side of the road since MRT side has some cover and construction which obstructs the view :)"
,,Worth a visit when in Singapore,4.0,,"I have been several times when friends are in town. The temple is not that old, built in the 90's I think. It is beautiful inside and depending on the time of year you might see a festival."
,,Quick half-hour visit; pleasant and serene,4.0,,"This beautiful temple sits on the edge of the bustling Singapore Chinatown section. Even though it is on a busy, touristy street, once you walk through the main doors, the noise from the hustle and bustle outside fades away. If you've visited temples in other parts of the world you'll understand when I say that there's a certain feeling you get when walking through it. It truly feels like a sanctuary - peaceful, serene, special. There is no entrance fee to get in and I highly recommend popping in here for a little bit. While there it's important to remain respectful of those around you. Many people visit this temple to pray, so voices should be kept to a whisper. There is no restriction on picture taking, so snap away. The architecture is stunning."
,,Quick visit!,4.0,,Visited here as we were exploring china town! It was actually very interesting and we are glad we popped in to have a look around. Anyone wearing short shorts and have their shoulders visible will be asked to cover up with clothing provided. Staff very friendly and it is very beautiful inside. Make sure you go here.
,,You can see it from a screen,3.0,,It's a beautiful temple but the tooth relic can be better seen it from a screen. It's a very fast visit. Proper cloths are required and offered at the entrance.
,,Pretty and Quiet,4.0,,"We visited this temple with our hopes not set too high, however we were pleasantly surprised with it. From the outside the building is pretty and on the inside it's even nicer.

We arrived when there was a prayer session which was so interesting to watch. If you have your shoulders uncovered or shorts above the knee on then you have to wear a sarong to enter but they do provide for you."
,,Get a look at Budhas,4.0,,We were lucky to get at time of mass and people were singing at it was so peaceful. Recomment to visit this place if you want to discover buddhism.
,,Definitely a must while near China Town,5.0,,"Pretty impressive especially in terms of the volume of gold inside (everywhere!). Big, spacious (we have been to many others really small) well managed. Perfectly organised as everything in Singapore - we were there just before closing time and hoping we could stay a bit longer, we could only be hoping :). They asked everybody to leave and closed exactly on closing hour."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Fantastic example of a classic Chinese temple. Watch prayer sessions on the ground floor and check every floor for exquisite statues. Floor 3 has souvenirs including a beautiful $10 gold plated coin of significance. Nice souvenir stalls in the lane adjacent.
,,Peaceful and relaxing,4.0,,"The building had several levels so make extra time, it is a peaceful and quite place to get out of the heat and read about the culture and religion, the upkeep is excellent, so make sure you donate as you walk in"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"A quick visit, as was very busy. Read a lot of the history on the walls, felt a bit like we were intruding on people's prayer. Lovely temple"
,,Never know if it was a famous temple,3.0,,"Just passing by when we visit Chinatown last time. I never know if it is a temple. In outside i can see a lot of table where some stone, plate and glass was in the upper. Before knowing it's temple, I thought it was a restaurant.
And in the back side there's some people who come to pray. In this moment i just realized that it was a temple."
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,"Take the MRT to Chinatown but do get the right exit. You want Pagoda Street. I took the wrong exit and ended up on the other side of a freeway and slightly lost in a shopping centre so ended up retracing my steps which added quite a lot of footwork and time.
I was glad I had checked on Tripadviser because I would have missed the actual tooth relic, assuming it was in the main body of the temple, which it was not, it was upstairs and you need to take a lift upstairs. The top floor is the prayer wheel in a small garden - lovely.
People were given cover up material if in shorts or short skirts so you might want to have trousers or a long skirt if wanting to see the relics.
I was really grateful for this experience."
,,Modern but impressive,4.0,,One can see that this tempel was recently built. Never the less it's the visit worth. Beautifull decorated. Don't forget the the elevations 2 till 5. We were lucky to see a ceremony
,,"Beautiful place, Gives a glimpse of early days of monks",4.0,,The place is nice and beautiful. Worth visiting. The surrounding outlook and scenery also adds value to a nature lover.
,,Nice temple!,3.0,,Been there on a rainy day :) nice place to stay and taste a little bite of the chinese culture and religion. Free entrance
,,Sorry but,2.0,,"Sorry but I feel like you've seen one temple: you've seen them all. Er nice Temple, but maybe not for me. Loved the seafood in the nearby street though!"
,,Buddha Tooth Temple,3.0,,"Easy to find in china town, take a lift to the top floor to find a garden to relax and take a rest. There is a refresment kiosk on one of the floors, we found it by accident and to exit is a bit a maze.something to see when in China town."
,,"""Ninjago"" temple",4.0,,"Easy sell to young child to go visit a real life ""ninjago temple""...a good opportunity to talk about other religions and cultures. Beautiful on the inside and out."
,,A big gorgeous gold laden buddhist temple,3.0,,"Once you enter the main shrine,the aroma of the incense fill you.The peacefulness descend on you. Many beautifully crafted buddha status. Many old artifacts at the museum too. No tickets needed to visit the temple. A instagramable place."
,,Lively spiritual building,4.0,,Located at chinatown. You have to dress properly to visit. They serve praying regularly. The interior is grande with gold touch on the altar. I saw praying and meals serve for the prayers n priests. The old building interior is really nice.
,,Good Intro to Buddhist Temples,4.0,,"We chanced upon the Tooth Relic Temple as they were in the midst of preparing for the mid-autumn celebrations, and as luck would have it, there was a service taking place during our perambulation of the temple. There is a good, detailed explanation of many aspects of the temple and the levels of hell, the buddhas manifestations, and so on, so that you can learn quite a bit about what you are seeing as you walk around the hall on the first floor. Note that if you are wearing shorts or a tank top you will want to put on a sarong and wrap (provided) as is the normal custom at Buddhist temples. There are also jewelry and other mementos on sale to help support the temple, though guided tours are free. A museum, and a rooftop garden also provide peaceful places to learn and reflect."
,,Just,3.0,,Came and worship buddha.Just different other chinese buddish temple.Good for chinese.Or with guide may be good.
,,Peaceful location,4.0,,"the temple ,few minutes from china town,entrance is free.it's a peaceful temple and the tooth relic are on 4th floor.please take note that some part are not allow to take picture"
,,Dynasty is historic but temple itself is fairly new...,3.0,,"We kind of stumbled upon this with our hotel a few minutes west and Chinatown a few minutes east, this fitted great into our day without any extra cost. Very imposing structure with red/green colours from the outset, but probably better crossing the road for taking pics otherwise you'll be too close. The temple is based on the Tang Dynasty from many centuries way back, but it was actually built around 15 years ago. When looking at its furnishings and architecture, it's easy to see that modernisation and maintenance slightly overlooks character, but character can possibly be achieved over a period of time. A few levels to view with the relic on the 4th, also many Buddhas in wall openings that have it's own individual craft. 30 minutes tops is all that's needed here, overall Singapore is not famed for it's temples with this one maybe being an exception..."
,,Beautiful temple quite picturesque,4.0,,"It's a very neat and clean temple. Quite picturesque This is he only attraction in china town which impressed us. If you don't see it, useless to go to china town"
,,Grand and captivating way of understanding Chinese Buddhism Culture,5.0,,"Chinatown MRT is the nearest train station to get to this place. Be aware that this is a religious place, hence, proper attire must be worn. Grand with lots of history and culture to be learned. Statues were captivating. A must visit!"
,,Cultural :),5.0,,"Take a look if you're in the area! It is a good cultural experience and inside, there is quite a lot to see. It's free after all! There are robes and shawls at the entrances to cover up if you are showing your lower thighs or shoulders."
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,It's beautiful inside and do note that no shoes are allowed and dress appropriately (they'll give you a robe to cover if you're wearing shorts/skirts). Entrance is free.
,,Cultural experience,5.0,,"In the heart of Chinatown is this spectacular temple. Wander Quietly through as people pray, chant and practice their spiritual devotions."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Temple is a four-storey buliding that has one of Buddha's teeth on the 5th floor. It is well worth visiting to see the Buddhist religion in operation (I'm Christian, but my wife was Buddhist). A peaceful location."
,,Humbling yet powerful!,5.0,,"One of the best Buddhist Temples I have visited. The first floor offers shrines and ceremonial sites. Two monks were singing out prayers when we got there. Recommending to dress appropriately but the place offers a robe while you visit the place. Outside the temple, offering plates were on tables. When you enter, a cloud of incense smoke engulf the place. You can take pictures as long as you don't use flashes. Walking towards the back is the main ceremonial temple. Signs ""not to take photos"" while at this site were,posted. A ceremony was on-going when we got there. Chanting and drums echoed the place. Security were around making sure you re not using your camera while the ceremony is at session. On the side of the building is the elevator and stairs. You can sit on the mezzanine balcony to observe the ceremony or you can proceed to the third level where they have a museum. Different sculptures of Buddhas are displayed. Not much of the prehistoric so era but somewhat historical years were displayed. You can take pictures here without the flash. The fourth level is the sacred museum where the actual Buddha's relics are displayed. Photos are not allowed here. You can view and read the historical anecdote on the displays. The fifth floor is the garden and the bell. So solemn and peaceful. It is a nice place to reflect and meditate. The round bell can be rotated while you pray. You are recommended to go around 4 times, representing the polar directions. Each direction has a bell. Such a powerful experience. The temple is free to visit but it would be nice to donate to support the up-keep of the place."
,,A dive into the Chinese Buddhist Culture.,5.0,,To get here you have to get off at China Town MRT and find the correct exit from the map. Or else you will end up walking quite a distance. I visited this temple around mid day on a week day so it wasn't too busy. There were people worshiping there. If you are wearing clothes that reveal skin they give shawls to cover up. You don't have to take off your shoes to see the ground floor but you have to take them off if you go to see the tooth relic on the 4th floor. They have shoe racks available. The rooftop has a an orchid garden which has some beautiful flowers. This place is a must visit site in Singapore so you can see their culture. There are a lot of locals that come here to pray and meditate.
,,Worth a visit if you are in town,4.0,,"Beautiful building with nice sculptures. Well-maintained and convenient to visit by MRT, bus or taxi. Usually spend 15-30 minutes here."
,,Must go,5.0,,"Calm atmosphere inside a crowdy and noisy premises. No above knee and sleeve less permitted, though they will give a scarf to wear if smeone wants entry."
,,Visit if you are in Chinatown or near maxwell,3.0,,Whenever my friends from overseas visit Singapore they ask to see this place. The visit should take no longer than 15 mins. Recommend to visit if you are near maxwell food centre (for chicken rice) or if you are already at china town.
,,Must go to place!,5.0,,I was in a taxi driving past and saw this interesting building. To my surprise it was lovely temple with beautiful sculptures. Great place to visit while you are in Chinatown...
,,"Outstanding, live temple and museum",5.0,,"Having visited a large number of Buddhist temples recently, this one stands out, even among several exceptional others. Ground floor chanting is a ritualistic beat welcome. Entrancing. The architecture and conditions of the Buddha statues is wonderful. However there are 4 other floors with history, beauty and a connection to this religion that it would be easy, and sad, to miss. Take the lift to the top garden and walk down floor by floor."
,,"Feel good, Calm down and Comfortable.",5.0,,"I read the review this temple before i visited in TA. I came to SG and tried to find this place. I love it very much. Feel so good and make me feel calm down. I want to stay all day. This place have 4 floors included the basement floor and have about history ~~ Next time when i come to SG, i will visit again ❤️‍♀️"
,,"Fascinating, Right in the Middle of Town",5.0,,"Walked through the temple on my own. Many tourists and worshippers. Very interesting artwork, statues, gods, etc. Would have been better if I had a guide to explain what everything was and what worshippers and monks were doing."
,,A place of peace.,5.0,,"Although located at the heart of China town in Singapore, this Temple is very peaceful indeed. I visited all the levels to understand as well as sighting the wonderful mi-ni religious museum."
,,Went there by chance but enjoyed it,4.0,,We ended up visiting this place even though it was not a part of our plan because our shared sightseeing coach started near this place. We felt nice to spend a few minutes here. It is very peaceful and if you are interested in Buddhism this is a must visit.
,,Always interesting,4.0,,"I've been to this temple several times on previous visits to Singapore. In fact, it is one the places I always visit when I am in the Chinatown area of Singapore. There is always something interesting going on at this temple and the most recent trip did not disappoint."
,,Gold!,5.0,,"The moment u step in to the temple, all you see is gold. We were lucky to witness monks chanting during our visit."
,,Free to enter... Not to be missed in Chinatown,5.0,,"If are a Buddhist, it's a must, if you are not, still a must to see in Singapore's Chinatown, if only for the sake of enriching your cultural worldview.

It's a temple first and a museum second, so proper attire is required: take your hat off, cover your legs and shoulders with free of cost provided aprons and scarfs.

The main floor is reserved for ceremonies, you certainly can enter, but the access might be limited during services, just like anywhere in the world. If you are lucky and visit during the prayers, it's very spiritual and mesmerizing to hear the Buddhist chants, even without understanding words, the singing sounds are very soothing and relaxing, even to a non-Buddhist.

There three more floors above, with various exhibits of Buddhists statues, and all religious paraphernalia. The 4th floor, is the one where the Buddha tooth relic is housed. Here any photography is strictly prohibited, as well as on the main floor during religious services, out of respect to the believers. On all the other floors, non-flash photos are fine. You can even get up all the way onto the top of the temple and see a big prayer wheel. Go turn it, clockwise only, please, and say a prayer, or a wish, if you want.

Before you leave, don't forget to return the borrowed apron and watch out for staircase exits as you might find yourself outside the temple right on the street;)

And light an incense stick, make a wish, say a prayer, and don't be shy to leave a small donation, the temple and museum are FREE to visit..."
,,Interesting temple for the Buddhist religion,4.0,,"I was interested to learn about the Buddhist religion and how a temple looks like inside. It has many different things like the statues, the stones for luck the offerings to the god..."
,,Beautiful Buddhist Museum/Temple,4.0,,We visited this Temple while we were walking downtown in Singapore. The temple is stunningly beautiful inside (see picture). It also has some informational displays. It's slightly weird to have tourists gawking while people are actually worshipping though. I would recommend if you're interested in learning more about the religion and observing the religion being practiced
,,Impressive Buddhist temple,5.0,,"This temple is called Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and is placed near Chinatown in a vibrant area plenty of restaurants and bars.
It's impressive and if you are lucky, you can follow a religious service.You can get some information from Buddhism reading the panels displayed around the temple.
Be respectful."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Excellent place to visit . Very clean and professional service. Very well maintained. Recommend to visit.
,,Stunning building,5.0,,"A truly amazing building, still being used for Buddhist worship. The exterior is gorgeous while the interior is awe inspiring. Still used by many to worship, this temple is a marvellous example of the 'old east' of yesteryear."
,,If you only do one temple this should be it,5.0,,This temple is well worth spending several hours. We had time restrictions and did not manage to get through it entirely. No bare or knees and shoulders however they do provide shawls and aprons for those that need.
,,Interesting and big temple,4.0,,Interesting and big temple. One of the upperlevels has a room with gold ornaments and the alleged tooth of buddha. There is a quit extensive museum in the temple (free of charge).
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One of the best buddhist temple I have seen. Take few hours to visit the whole building (4 floors) and the interesting museum, simply awesome Thanks"
,,Surprise Excellent Attraction,5.0,,"I'd read about this place but it wasn't high on my priority list. However, we stumbled upon the temple while in Chinatown because of the beautiful chanting coming from within. It really is a wonderful place to spend an hour. The fact that we visited during morning prayers was a bonus, but do take time to visit the museum and see the incredible ""Madam Tussaud's"" monks who have been important in growing Buddism in Singapore."
,,Very impressive!,4.0,,"Free admission. Don't have to take your shoes off. Must take hats off!
Very ornate religious relics and statues throughout the entire site. Make sure you go to the rooftop. Photo opportunities allowed and in abundance.

,,Something different from shopping malls,3.0,,Need to visit location besides shopping malls in Singapore. Free to enter this temple. No problem taking photos
,,Interesting place to vist,4.0,,"We sort of chanced upon this place as we sauntered around China Town. We felt very welcomed but I felt a little concerned at how disrespectful some people were: taking photographs of people praying is disrespectful. We entered the sacred area where the Buddha Tooth can be seen. Is this really a tooth? I'll let you decide.

Highly recommended"
,,Extremely interesting visit,5.0,,Fairly easy to find in Chinatown and very interesting. We went in t-shirt and shorts and were asked to put on shawls to cover our shoulders and long apron-type things for our legs. They had a big box of these which you could dip into. You could spend as little or as long as you want there and there's plenty to see. The actual room housing Buddha's tooth had signs displayed for the removal of shoes and to speak quietly as people were meditating. Photos were also not allowed in that particular room but apart from that pictures were not prohibited.
,,Interesting architecture and magnificent artifacts on display,4.0,,"Whilst visiting Chinatown we came across this marvellous temple with so many intricate and colourful artifacts on display over 3 levels, then we went back downstairs where the monks had started chanting sutras - very humbling experience.

,,Visit,4.0,,This temple is located in Chinatown near Sago lane and South Bridge road junction. It's a huge modern temple where the relic is kept. Nearby is a famous Hindu temple as well. Around the area is the iconic Chinatown backstreets where a walk about is will make your visit worthwhile .
,,Enchanting,5.0,,I have visited Singapore a few times and this was the first time I had ventured inside and I was so glad I did. The temple is beautiful inside and we happened to be there when a service was taking place. A great experience listening to the monks reciting the sutras.

,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"We stumbled across this while there was a ceremony going on, were welcomed in to watch, at the end of this we were putting shawl etc back & were invited to look around top 3 floors which were a museum etc, Buddha Tooth Relic stored in big case & there was one floor of wax sculptures of previous leaders. This was a very humbing experience."
,,Interesting but not exceptional,3.0,,Enjoyed wandering around but not outstanding. Interesting in parts but you really need someone to explain the place. We did not unfortunately. Still well worth visiting though.
,,Fascinating Temple,4.0,,"Don't miss this temple when visiting Chinatown: during my visit there was a service in progress, with monks and worshippers reciting prayers and lovely chants. If dressed decently, you are allowed to get inside the temple and visit it even during services."

,,religious site,5.0,,dress decently good to pray fiull of visitors but calming in itself parking availabel below in chinatown free 10min grace parking next to vistor center and food etc

,,"Fascinating temple, lovely chanting",5.0,,"I really enjoyed visiting this working temple where monks, worshippers and tourists respectfully mingle. A service was in progress and it was fascinating to watch it unfold as well as listen to the lovely chants. Thank you."
,,Chinese temple,4.0,,This is a temple in chinatown! As you enter the temple you will see many buddhist people praying and practicing religious event. The interior is shining gold too.

,,This is Singapore's 62 Million $ Temple!,5.0,,"Do you like temples? Don't leave Singapore without visiting here!

This is more than just a temple. It is floors of beauty and peace!
There is a casual temple on the ground floor, and to the right there is a little stairway and elevator, that takes you to further floors..

The second floor is amazing! It is almost a museum in itself, full of stunning gold Buddhas and statues, and some exquisite pieces. Behind a glassed area, you can view the Buddha Tooth Relic whic is made with over 300kgs of pure gold. For those that like to mediate there are raised floors for prayer and meditation. Beautiful.

The third floor is one of the most incredible Buddhist museums I have ever seen, with bone and tongue relics and collectables from old worlds, photos, jewels, clothing. It has the life story of Buddha himself including his family and childhood stories that I found incredible.

The roof top is an incredible garden area. Walk the 10 Thousand Buddha pergola and view the worlds larger prayer wheel.

Allocate a good few hours to really feel the magic of the temple."
,,"""A must to visit when in Singapore""",5.0,,A breath taking temple. Hearing the monks and nuns chanting is surreal and spiritual. Whenever in Singapore I feel the need to visit this temple. This year my husband and I each made a special donation for the a monk to give us special blessings.
,,A gem of a place,5.0,,"A remarkable place, serene and fascinating. The museum on the 3rd floor has some beautiful figures and Buddhist relics. We spent 45 minutes here and it was too rushed. One and a half to two hours would have been perfect."
,,Peaceful Saturday,4.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is such an oasis of tranquility in such a vibrant city. No matter what religion one belongs to this is such a haven and enlightening experience
,,One word: Spiritual,5.0,,"This temple's historic significance is well known so I feel no need to recount it. However, I must say it is a beautiful structure, from outside as much as it's from inside. Every detail in architecture and interior decor leaves an observer spell bounded.

When we arrived the worshippers were reading some prayers in unison, the experience was truly melodic and trance like that someone who doesn't subscribe to Buddhism felt deeply.

It's an incredibly welcoming place and a must see when you're in Singapore."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"We visited during a prayer session. The main hall was completely filled with people (including some monks) reading/singing text from a book, which was very impressive. Additionally, there are lots of different things to see and read here."
,,Beautiful but busy,5.0,,"Beautiful and colorful temple but very busy with lots of tourists. I had to put a wrap over my shorts to cover my legs, but this was provided by the temple near the entrance."
,,"Beatiful, Ornate and Atmospheric Temple",4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in the heart of Chinatown is a beautiful building and well worth a visit.
Obviously it is famous for what is reputedly the tooth of Buddha but whether it is genuine or not has been the subject of much debate. Personally I don't think it actually matters when you see the sheer reverence of the faithful who visit here.
It is an absolutely resplendant building full of golden icons, altars and shrines, gold gilt stupas and gorgeous candles and burning insense.
It is such a spiritual place, I am not a buddist and know very little about the religion but I still found it a very moving experience and would recommend it to anyone."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"It's not a real pagoda, but a place for praying only. Inside is same as a bulding with many modern and convenient facilities. There's a small garden in the top, but not any view, because it locates in the street."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"If temples are your thing then thus may be for you. Lots of elaborate decor and interesting information. Across the road is a great stall centre where you can buy food, take a rest and some souvenier shopping."
,,Inspiring.,5.0,,Visited this temple on part of a cycle tour and unfortunately only had 15 minutes here. Would have spent hours wandering round if we'd have had the opportunity as it was spectacular once you went in.
,,visited during prayer session,5.0,,"I don't know how often they are, but when I visited there was a prayer session going on with the monks chanting from books and quite a few ""locals"" sat also following the readings."
,,Loved this place,5.0,,"A very peaceful, spiritual feeling here. Entry is free but there is a box for donations. They also give you free incense sticks and invite you to light them and say a prayer. The carving is beautiful and colourful."
,,First of its kind modern Chinese temple with aircon,5.0,,"Imagine a extravagant temple with plenty of Gold, deco details and most surprise of all, air condition. This temple even has lift for your visits to 4 of the 5 floors available. Roof top garden is thru stairs. There is even meditation areas on the 4th floor with aircon !
There is historical stuff available for one understanding located on 3rd floor including the 2nd."
,,stunning!!!,5.0,,beautiful and impressive. we were lucky to be there at mediation time and hear the chanting. highly recomended.
,,Nice chinese temple,5.0,,"This temple is built in chinese style to worship tooth rethlic of buddha. You are free to enter until 6PM. It is actually not so large inside but glorious and suprising since the there are hundreds of lights and candles. At night, it is lightend up outside. Just take an MRT to Chinatown and cross a street to visit this structure."
,,A lesser known beauty,4.0,,"Not something you'd come across as the top things to do, but if you're a fan of beautiful temples, then this could be in your list. With s lot of gold used, and aesthetic architecture, this temple makes for a good pleasant experience."
,,Must see Chinese Temple,5.0,,"I have been living in Singapore for a few years, but never went there...this time I was tourist and visited this important temple.

Very impressive, huge and well managed, a must see if you are visiting Singapore.

Take also time to stroll around the streets surrounding the temple...."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Love the architecture here! Stunning! It is located in Chinatown, nearby other attractions. Behind this temple is a way to a market."
,,Not just for Buddhists,5.0,,We would thoroughly recommend a visit. Lucky enough to drop by as a service was in full swing. Lovely experience for a westerner.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,A free attraction which is worth a look. Lots of interesting facts about Buddhism. Dress respectfully and enjoy taking photos. Prayers were being said when we arrived and tourists are allowed to listen and watch from sidelines. Garden at top and something on every floor to keep people entertained.
,,Calm in the midst if chaos,5.0,,Peaceful and interesting place. Came across this by chance and very happy I did. After a morning of walking in the heat and noise this place was like an oasis. No entrance fee but donations suggested. Well worth a visit.
,,A spot of serenity in a hectic city,5.0,,An impressive temple in the middle of Chinatown. Make sure you are properly dressed to enter the temple and don't forget to go upstairs for the tooth relic and the roof garden.
,,A Cultural Eye Opener,5.0,,"I was entranced. I'd read nothing about it and expected to go into an empty building. How wrong could I be!!!? Absolutely breathtaking and no charge. I only saw the ground floor so can only comment on this. You enter a large vestibule area which has large Buddhist statues on one wall. Please excuse my ignorance but I don't know their names and can't recall the information that was provided. They are beautiful. Around the room are several more Buddha-like statues. Smaller but each one surrounded by 100 even smaller statues. Each larger Buddha statue is dedicated to one or two of the Chinese zodiac characters (rooster, dragon, pig, ox etc). All exquisitely painted and carved and flanked by two protective Chinese warriors. You walk through this room to a huge hall. At one end is a large Buddha plus other statues. What I found entrancing however was a room full of priests, and others, chanting as they read from a book. An amazing experience. If you know more about Buddhism than I clearly do you'll find the experience even more rewarding. I've never experienced this before and it was amazing!"
,,Amazing sacred architecture.,5.0,,"This is a must visit temple in Singapore. The architecture and colors are incredible! Since it's a sacred place, the women will have to cover up themselves."
,,The curious question of the 3000 x 4-5 star reviews vs the 12 x 1 star reviews.,5.0,,"Let's quickly analyse the crazy 1 star outliers:

1 x ' felt uncomfortable with the ostentatious decor' and 'a bit of a rip-off'

Note: it's free buddy, but not a Protestant church, soz.

1 x 'a bit of a disappointment' ... 'if you have been to all of the temples in Beijing and HK'

Editor's side: so, probably 3 or 4 stars then, mate?

2 x 'amazing temple'

Thought: probably gave Louvre 1 star as well. This star system is tricky, eh guys!

4 x 'it's a fake' slash 'not really authentic' slash 'go to a real temple' slash 'it's a sham'

Counterpoint: practicing monks, space for laymen to actively meditate, thousands of Buddha statues, and a physical building for spiritual guidance and practice probably come close enough to the definition of a temple to appease the common man.

2 x 'waste of time' with 'nothing to see and boring'

Observation: there is probably only one other four-floored building in Singapore that has more to see. 2 men's junk is 3000 other men's treasure. Also noteworthy that this contributor gives 1 star to the MRT, which clearly has to be one of, if not the best in the world, while giving the Sultan's Mosque 5 stars as it is 'good for taking photo'.

1 x illogical argumentum ad passiones regarding posing questions to the monks concerning Tibetan monk self-immolation and that 'the temple was built with dozens of millions of dollars and kilograms of gold'

Score: 5 star review with 1 star sense, let's call it a perfect 5 out of 7.

1 x full unedited review: ""Because it's there? Scientists say this is the tooth of an animal. This place is less than a decade old. No history - so why""

Dr Zoidberg's reply: why not?

Summary: this is clearly a true gem in the heart of Singapore's downtown, with a vegetarian restaurant in the basement, an amazing opportunity to photograph monks chanting in an out-of-this-world setting, convenient location 4 minutes walk to MRT, SMRT at the door, a Buddhist museum, a true vibe space to meditate, a rooftop garden to chill, the world's largest Tibetan prayer wheel, a place of pilgrimage for those who believe the temple holds a relic of Gautama Buddha, and is totally free.

I give it 1 star."
,,A beautiful temple,5.0,,It's such a beautiful temple to visit. The rooftop gardens is small but wonderfully meditative. Must visit!
,,SO many Buddhas!,4.0,,"As you can tell from the photos, this place is HUGE and there are Buddha's everywhere - large, small and in between. AND it is a place of worship - they kindly provide wraps if you are wearing something sleeveless. When I was there, there were Buddhists chanting in the back room and it help calm your spirits to listen and watch. Then we walked to the front area and someone was leading chanting with a large number (30 or more) people joining in. So DO remember this is a place of worship and be respectful. Didn't go to the museum but still remember the feeling that I had standing in their sacred space."
,,A true gem,5.0,,This is an amazing place. I was there during a large group for prayer. Truly a place needed to visit no matter what your faith.
,,Not just a tourist attraction,4.0,,"When we walked into the temple from the hot streets outside, we were fortunate to arrive during a service. It was a very special feeling to hear the munks chanting (along with religions visitors). The temple is certainly not just a tourist trap. Well worth a stop if you are in Chinatown."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"It is possibly the most beautiful temple I have ever visited! It was stunning inside. Thus, they have sarongs especially for people whose clothes are not appropriate enough. However, I have no idea how to go upstair and there is not direction, I believe. One thing I do have to note is that the toilet can get really crowded and there is unpleasant smell as well. I actually don't mind that because that is an extra part of the temple. Overall, it was a delightful experience and everything is absolutely flawless. Yes, every single thing."
,,Nice,5.0,,"Good spot to pop in singapore, i enjoyed any temple in asia and i recommend this one as well, but you have to wear appropriate clothes"
,,Lots of lay people and tourist,5.0,,"Came here on a Sunday and saw a ceremony in session. Lots of tourist were here as well to grab some pictures and offer incense. You'll be asked to cover up if you're showing shoulders and wearing clothes above the knees. When you enter, you can walk all the way straight to exit on the opposite side."
,,A quite special pagoda,5.0,,It's not the same like other Chinese style pagodas. architecture and design are quite strange but beautiful and modern. Good to spend some time to slow down your life enjoying the atmosphere and find your inner peace.
,,Sacred Feeling,5.0,,This is one of the best things Singapore has to offer. The place is most beautiful and visiting this place is divine the feeling is sacred. great place.
,,Beautful,5.0,,"Stumbled across the Buddhist temple while exploring Chinatown. Worth it to see Buddhist monks and devotees chanting in prayer, it was very hypnotising. We were shown around by a helpful volunteer, catch the lifts up to the higher floors to the rooftop garden and to see the Buddha's tooth."
,,Only good for a brief stop,3.0,,Classes were taking place and there was a narrow 'path' each side. Note: arms and legs should be covered.
,,Temple in Chinatown,4.0,,"It has 4 levels I think (thank goodness for lifts!), and it is well ventilated with airconds. You may light an oil lamp there and may even see monks chanting at certain time of the day."
,,Quick visit,3.0,,We went in to the temple for a quick look. It's quite colourful. It felt a bit odd getting in the way of people in their devotions. Note quite enough space to be unobstrusive.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Even if there is no history related to this building if I remeber well, it is impressive and should be part of your visits during your stay. We went there at the beginning of the evening and we have been fortunate to attend a prayer session. It's not like in mosques where they shut the access while moslims are praying.
Still in Chinatown, pretty close from here, you have an indian temple which also deserve a visit. It was a nice visit there too because a lot of people were there. So you could have an idea of how they are practicing their religion. We also when there around 7 or 8 pm.
Consequently, I advise you to go there at 7 or 8 pm."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Although the temple is not old, it does have a authentic feel to it. It's beautifully made and the atmosphere is serene. It's worth the visit on your walk through China Town."
,,Solemn serene and holy,5.0,,"An amazing temple which is so full of positive vibes.
The beauty of this temple is in its blessings, the architecture, the sculptures, the ambience, the way it's managed by the polite team of Buddhists and the opportunity it gives you to have an insight into Buddhism...
A must see in every sense.."
,,Picturesque temple,4.0,,"This was a very enlightening experience, seeing a prayer service in a building with such amazing architecture. Remember to dress appropriately (respectful clothing)."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"If you are in the Chinatown area go into this beautiful building. There is no entry fee, you can make a donation,if you wish. People were friendly and happy to share their knowledge, well worth a visit"
,,Charming,5.0,,Charming temple. Beautiful interior! Conveniently located in the centre of Chinatown. What I didn't really like is that it's a bit touristy.
,,Most beautiful place I've ever seen,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore you need to visit this place! It is in the heart of Chinatown, the temple is just wonderful and spectacular. Very different from any temple I've seen in Singapore and Bangkok maybe it's the most beautiful temple I've ever seen. Highly recommend. Definitely would suggest to wear a long pare of jeans!"
,,Buddha Temple,4.0,,Was here while making walking tour around singapore city. i reach here after visiting clark quay and chinatown. temple was so good and giving cool look of the architecture and the inside view was breath taking with buddha statue. should visit here if you're around.
,,A surprise,4.0,,"I didn't know much about the temple before I arrived. I must admit I don't know much more now, but I don't care the experience was lovely.

The ground floor is a visual delight full of golds and reds and jam packed with icons. There is a vegetarian restaurant on one of the levels, a beautiful meditation level with some stunning relics and items and then at the very top is a roof top garden.

If you are wearing shorts you will be given a sarong to cover up. Also there are lifts in this ancient temple (which was an utter surprise)."
,,"Very impressive and grand temple, worth a visit",4.0,,"I quite like temples, my husband is not so keen. However, as this particular Buddhist temple was only a short walk from where we were staying in Chinatown, and it's rated #13 on TripAdvisor for things to see and do, I thought it was worth a look. Being 5-storeys high, it's a large and impressive building from a distance. Up close, you can peer straight through the open doors into the very colourful and impressive main prayer room. Visitors are most welcome and we were lucky enough to be there when the prayer room was full with monks and locals chanting, I believe it was a celebration for one of the Gods they pray to. We wandered up through the levels, one floor was a small museum with many Buddhist artefacts and valuables, another floor had life-sized figures of venerable Buddhist monks, the 4th floor is simply dazzling and incredibly ornate as it features a display of a tooth of the Buddha inside a solid gold stupa - there is so much gold on display, contrasting with the red decor, it's almost overwhelming. The rooftop garden is peaceful, there is a very large Prayer Wheel within a pavilion, surrounded by tropical plants and flowers, a small oasis. Definitely worth a look."
,,Open until 5 pm,5.0,,Go before 5 pm.after close. It is very memorable and beautiful temple. I loved it. Women must cover shoulders. At the top flor there is a cyclical wish thing.
,,Beautiful and serene,4.0,,Situated near china town and very close to train stations. The temple is artistic and beautiful. Quiet a historic place and worth visiting the roof TOP garden as well.
,,Fascinating place and culture.,5.0,,"We love visiting the religious place around the world. Buddhism has been fascinating me, maybe because of my Chinese roots. Explore this place and get surprised with each corner."
,,Special,4.0,,Very ornate and quite recent temple. Well worth a visit. Very busy but some how seems to manage crowds well.
,,Plenty of photo opportunities,4.0,,"One of the newest Buddhist temples in Singapore, this lavish building is one of the best dressed. Various ceremonies are lined up in accordance to customary practices. Back corner of the ground floor has a line up of different deities, accompanied by explanation for the un-initiated.
Recommend to venture to the upper floors to investigate various facets of Buddhism. Particularly the orchid garden on the top floor is a quaint hide-out in a busy city.
Enjoy the visit."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This is a working temple and one is impressed by the focus of the devotees. The temple is aesthetically beautiful and the museum is very informative. A very interesting, informative and enjoyable visit - free entry was a bonus."
,,Memorable experience,5.0,,"This is an amazing temple, took a while to find but got there in the end. Do not miss going to it, it has a strange, tranquil ambience to it - Undescribable"
,,So many Buddhas,4.0,,"We went on here as part of our Chinatown walking tour and had time to look around the lower floor and made the effort to go back ourselves afterwards to visit the upper levels including the museum.
One of the most impressive temples that I have visited and so glad we did."
,,Historic place,4.0,,"One of the oldest buddha temples in Singapore. In main china town, very close to pagoda street or temple street. Must visit if have a religious bend or otherwise interested in buddha/ Buddhism. All religion people welcome."
,,Buddha Relic,3.0,,Located in Chinatown. Food center near. Nice relic temple. Taxis are generally easy to get. Avoid Fridays. Too crowded. Weekdays Saturday Sunday 👌
,,Eyecandy,5.0,,"I love how this place looks like in person. I just went on a quick stroll to this place since I just live nearby and haven't really gone inside.

Remember that this is a temple so you need to wear appropriate clothing. They also have Introduction to Meditation classes there. Be sure to come early so you can check the schedule."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Went there for the first time and I was surprise how tourist friendly it is. Clothing was being prepared for those who wear mini skirt or shorts. Impressive.
,,Pretty cool.,4.0,,"Came here with my 10 year old daughter. Amazing temple, beautiful rooftop garden. Thoroughly recommend coming in to get away from the hectic Chinatown bustle and crowds."
,,Everything you wanted to learn about Buddha and more!,4.0,,"We stumbled on this because we were in Chinatown before most of the places were open. Glad we did. Sarongs are provided if you are wearing shorts, and also for covering your shoulders. Actual services are going on, with monks chanting to the Buddha on the first floor. There is something to see on every floor. I believe we started on the 4th floor and worked our way down. The 4th floor had a garden with a giant prayer wheel. The 3rd floor was like a museum about the history of Buddha. I learned a lot. The 2nd floor was a history of the temple. Interesting place."
,,One interesting cultural visit I warmly recommend,5.0,,"Fantastic and interesting temple, well preserved and located right in the middle of China Town. One of the top touristic points of interest for a complete trip to Singapore."
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,If you're in Singapore it is a must see. It's well kept and offers service viewings which is a very spiritual moment to witness.
,,Go on a Saturday morning for an experience,5.0,,"We went there on a Saturday morning as a local suggested. We were there by 11:00am and got to observe the ceremony, make it an experience and take really good photos."
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,"An enormous buddhist temple, which showcases various types of Buddha, with details of their names, what they stand for, their symbolism etc. Do read the placards placed alongside to enjoy.
Don't forget to go to level 3 and level 4 (these close by 6 pm sharp). Level 3 is entire golden, and looks magnificent. While the top floor has a garden.
Overall quite enjoyable."
,,Buddha tooth relic temple,5.0,,"My husband, 2 year old and I visited here on our first day in Singapore and really enjoyed the visit. Entry is free and there are wraps and shawls to cover knees and shoulders. The roof garden was also very nice to see."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. A beautiful sacred , tranquil place amongst the chaotic vibe of Chinatown. Make sure to go to the 4th floor where you can meditate, say prayers, honour the Buddha and say a prayer at the Oraying wheel."
,,BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,"It's really beautiful and colorful. I went there twice to take pictures. There were many tourist visiting but it was not crowded .

My nephew (12) and my niece (9 years old) from Australia loved the temple, we spent over one hour and they didn't stop making comments how beautiful is the temple."
,,beautiful temple,5.0,,"Worth spending time here. The Temple is clean, well organized and air conditioning. There's a section for you to copy the Scripture such as ""Xinjing"" if you have plenty of time, buy souvenior or just relax and enjoy a cup of hot tea.
One of the floor also provide a quiet place for meditating! It's an excellent Temple."
,,Tooth Relic Buddah Temple,3.0,,"It is close to Chinatown MRT and it is next to the main road. During certain festival the themes inside the temple will change; like the hungry ghost festival. They will show case information regarding this.

At the basement of the temple (accessible outside the temple leading down the steps), you may also visit the vegetarian shop where you can enjoy some food. Payment is in the form of donation. Otherwise you may walk across the street later to the hawker center to have you lunch. It is called the Maxwell Food court. Unfortunately it is hidden behind the construction site. So you will have to walk around that.

Once you toured around the first floor, take the lift to the upper floors. You will see a mini exhibition of certain items like mini museum. The entrance is free. After that remember to visit the rooftop area. You will see a mini garden and an extremely large Tibetian bell. You can take some photos here, where you can also see the background of the schoolhouse and skyscrapers behind you."
,,Take some time to visit,5.0,,"Even if you are not a religious person, save some time to visit this temple. Start from the top floor and keep going down until the ground. You will see a garden, a museum and the religous part. Don´t forget do dress properly an be respectful as services are held several times.."
,,Beautiful and spiritual place,5.0,,"It's a beautiful place with a very central location, so it would be a shame not to go. The decorations within and outside on the facade are amazing and the tranquility which resides indside is vary inspirering."
,,It's beautiful,5.0,,I actually don't like monuments as such I find them scary. But this is really well kept and quite stunning. A lot of people try and visit here so I would recommend doing so too
,,A must when coming to Singapore,5.0,,"We came across this temple without much of an expectation but the place is not only gorgeous, it is big and choc-ful of information on Buddhism. A service was going on and tourists were still welcomed and encouraged to walk by. Visit the temp,e and make sure to go to all floors temple. Worth your time"
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,5.0,,Visit this place with a peaceful mind. Visit the level 4 meditation corner where you will feel and experience the calm in the historical district of Singapore and yes the famous Maxwell Market just 5 minutes walk away.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Do see. It is one of the beautiful temples of Buddha. Prayer hall is marvolous. cool and calm atmosphere.
,,Amazing to see!,5.0,,Spent a good hour here - in awe of the size of the temple and Buddhas on display. The gold has to be seen to be believed. Be prepared to wear the scarves and sarongs provided for entry if attending in short summer clothing.
,,Fascinating Cultural Experience,5.0,,"In the middle of Chinatown is this beautiful temple. It has an amazing educational floor where you can learn about Buddhism in all its forms and then the actual sanctuary with the tooth is very peaceful and welcoming. Unlike tooth temples elsewhere, you can actually see the tooth. I recommend this wholeheartedly."

Shawls are provided if clothing is unsuitable."
,,Thought provoking,4.0,,"We enjoyed wandering around the temple and learning more about this fascinating religion.

,,An unusual sight,5.0,,"When we stopped here during our walk through Chinatown I was quite impressed. They had a service going on, with perhaps 100 Buddhists doing a chant. I had never seen such a thing before.

I was also surprised at the different number of icons that they have for various purposes. This is quite a colorful place and one that you should definitely experience."
,,Very magic place!,5.0,,Very magic place. Nice architecture. If you are lucky you can meet monks praying and singing. Great experience. If you want to meet real chineese culture go to eat something in front of the temple 2nd floor in the market. There is a great food court.
,,Goose bumps...!,5.0,,"I was visiting this temple by chance while the monks were singing and praying in the prayer room on at the ground floor. Witnessing this gave me goose bumps... Unforgettable!! The temple also holds a museum on two stories, a meditation hall that is open for everyone, the tooth relict as well as a nice roof garden that comes somewhat as a surprise."
,,Loved this temple.,5.0,,"There are four floors, and all are worth a visit. Loved the Artifacts on the Museum floor. Can take a little time and meditate for a few minutes in the hall on the fourth floor. They have a guided tour in English on Saturdays. Around 2.00p.m, I think. I missed it, but have heard its good."
,,Cultural visits,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was built for the veneration of the relic, to promote Buddhist culture and education and provide welfare services to the public. It is a Tang-Dynasty style building. The temple gets its name from what the Buddhists regard as the left canine tooth of Buddha, which has been recovered from his funeral pyre in Kushinagar, India and displayed in its grounds. It contains thousands of small buddha statues at wall sides and a few large statues of buddhas and bodhisattva. The interior design can be seen very costly and is built to serve a reminder to everyone about its culture and religon. The best time to go is around 9 to 10am as it wont be that crowded and filled with tourist. There will also be chnating held in there sometimes, when it is an important day for buddhsim or maybe a festival event or to follow the 8 precepts event. There is also the 12 chinese animal zodiac and their respective buddhas or bodhisattva and there will be notes of how your attitude may be like or your character

,,exceptional temple,5.0,,"remarkable temple, beautifully maintained, exceptional museum, the highlight of our tour in Singapore"

,,A spiritual experience,5.0,,Visiting the place had an unusual and still calm and soothing vibe on me. I felt something that I can't put my finger onto. The live chanting is mesmerising and the chamber where the tooth is kept is beautiful. A must visit spot for any traveller.

,,Imposing Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"Whilst walking around the Chinatown Complex and Maxwell Hawker Centre, we came out to an opening where we saw this very large imposing temple. It was very easy to spot it and on reaching it, we saw it was the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. My two colleagues was Buddhist from Sri Lanka and the one was coincidentally a Buddhist priest so he was excited at being able to explore this temple.

One can visit this interesting temple for free. Whilst the outside was bustling and inside, there was a calm and peaceful atmosphere prevailing. Various buddhas was on the walls with the different modes of Chinese calendar, ie. Year of the Rooster, the Dragon, etc. It was fund trying to find the Buddha that matched the year of myr birth and animal. The temple has 5 stories with a giant rolling prayer wheel on the top floor.

The temple is well maintained and one can see from the furnishing and appearance that it is well supported. A vegetarian restaurant on the side supports the upkeep of the temple."

,,Good experience,5.0,,You will be mesmerize how many buddhas are there. You can visit the wax statues and the roof top garden. Recommend ladies to wear long pants and top with sleeves (don't worry if you forget they provide cover-uo at the entrance. You can take photos but please do it discreetly as this is a solemn place for prayers. Make sure to check the operating hours before your visit.
,,Ornate temple in excellent condition,4.0,,Worth the visit! When we arrived the monks and visitors were chanting a long passage and then there was a brief traditional religious ritual.
,,Imposing,4.0,,"The highlight of the temple for us was the top floor which contained a beautifully maintained garden, and an impressive array of Buddha statues. It is a peaceful place in contrast to the main hall and the museum floors which tend to be crowded and noisy. This is an active temple where a huge number of locals visit, so treat it with respect and wear appropriate clothing. The chanting of the monks can be quite mesmerizing, and you can leave the place feeling quite light headed (or that could be due to the copious quantities of incense being burnt). It is different to other temples in that there are explanations in English with most statues and artworks."
,,Impressive temple!,5.0,,"This was one of the first temples we visited in Singapore, and it is indeed one of our favourites.
It is an oasis of peace and tranquility that is inviting and warm. The big halls are impressive due to their decor and attention to detail; it is simply extremely beautiful.
We were particularly impressed by the Hundred Dragons Hall - Maitreya Hall, having a hundred Buddhas enshrined on both sides of the hall. There is also a collection of Buddhist artefacts that relates on the third level of the temple, as part of the museum.
On top, on the fourth floor, you will find a lovely garden and the Ten Thousand Buddhas Pagoda, which holds a large Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel. Just take a minute and sit on a bench in this peaceful place!

You will see worshipers around the main halls. In case you are not wearing appropriate clothing (i.e. your shoulders are not covered), the temple will provide shawls.

Definitely an attraction that should not be missed!"
,,Beautiful Temple!,5.0,,"I wasn’t sure what to expect from the outside, but the temple is stunning on the inside. It is opulent, there are lots of little details and yet it feels very peaceful to be surrounded by all the Buddhas. Must visit!"
,,An oasis of peace and calm in Chinatown,5.0,,"This is well worth a visit, but make sure you cover your shoulders and legs. They have shawls and long sarongs for you to use. It was built in 2007 at a cost of S$75 mil, and apparently has a roof garden and Museum, but we couldn't see how to get there. There were people chanting whilst we wandered through the front room, I thought it was a recording until we got to the main 100 buddha room and saw them all praying. Quite an awesome sight, and very moving spiritually. We stayed quite a while just absorbing the energy and admiring the majesty of our surroundings."
,,Couldnt find upper floor access,5.0,,It's a remarkable building. I really wished it provided more information on the statues on the site. It was full of worshippers and very beautiful. Its one of the places a tour guide would have been appreciated.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Busy with worshippers. Has a good atmosphere and tourists are welcomed in. Free to enter. Shawls and long sarongs available for those not wearing respectful clothing (shoulders covered, knee length bottoms)"
,,Living museum,5.0,,"I had the opportunity to visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple while staying in Singapore during my last stay there and I had a really good time.

I went there around 8/9am and the timing was perfect as there was a ceremony on and not too many tourist around. It gives you enough time to take some photo, burn some incense and do some shopping in the temple to support their community eventually.
There is about 4 levels to have a look at and each one is a must have a look at as there is a lot to see each time.

I would go back there on my next visit."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Marvelous place, beautifully decorated. Prayers were going on during our visit, which gave it an even more special feeling. Staff very friendly and you're allowed to take pictures almost everywhere. Don't forget to visit all the floors AND roof."

,,Amazing,5.0,,"We had a look right over the temple and it was so interesting, well worth a visit. There was just so much to see and take in."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is my favourite temple in Singapore. Fascinating to be there during a ceremony and listen to the chanting from the monks while the worshippers follow the service. Upstairs, the tooth relic is fascinating and the giant revolving drum is beautifully detailed. If you do nothing else in Chinatown, visit this beautiful place"
,,Must see,5.0,,Especially during ceremonies the temple is really worth visiting if you want to get an inside into Buddhism. In my opinion the only interesting thing to see inside Chinatown.
,,Surprisingly Satisfying - GO for It,5.0,,"Admittedly, whilst living in this neighbourhood for the past few years, I did enjoy the spectacular Chinese architecture of this temple from the outside, and it did put a smile on my face (btw - I am not of the Buddhist denomination), I had never stepped a foot inside until recently.

I did go in last week, taking a visiting friend along.

It was a VERY pleasant surprise indeed!

Start from the top floor, rooftop gardens, and walk down to find out about, or to just enjoy Buddhist history, scripture, artifacts, praying areas, and memorabilia.

There is no sell, at all, just a quietly passionate religion in action, bang in the middle of the Singapore city centre!"
,,A good look into Buddhist culture.,5.0,,"The was a great temple to visit. They supply you with a cover if you are not wearing the appropriate clothing and you can take pictures on the first floor. The was a ceremony of some sort happening while we were there so we were able to get the full experience! Make sure you go upstairs to the third floor to see the Buddha Tooth, it's huge!"
,,Amazing active temple,5.0,,"This temple has 4-5 levels which you can reach by climbing the stairs or taking the lifts. It is a very busy active place with many people and monks praying and/or meditating, so be respectful of that. Also be aware that you should have your legs & arms covered, so wear a long skirt or pants - they do provide a box with coverings if you need it. There are numerous sculptures and carvings all throughout the temple, and signboards to explain everything. Some sections require you to remove your shoes. Not all sections allow photography. It is worth spending at least one hour here. Beautiful temple!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"What an amazing place to visit. So much to see in a working temple. Lifts,stairs and even stair lift available so accessible to all. Stairs to top floors not immediately visible so if like us you don't see them just ask and you'll be directed. Lovely rooftop garden area, so many things on display on the various floors. A lovely place to visit regardless of your own beliefs."
,,Not so hidden but a most beautiful treasure to experience,5.0,,"Mind blowing chanting by monks and nuns and ""normal"" people in a holy and wondrous temple. It's all just overwhelmingly spiritual experience. Make it a must on your visit."

,,Nice place with nice vegetarian restaurant at the basement,5.0,,"Nice place to visit admist the crowded Chinatown.

And do visit the lovely vegetarian restaurant at the basement, one of he best and cheapest vegetarian food for sale there. Nice cosy restaurant too."

,,A great temple for devotees and visitors alike (NOTE MY TIP HERE!),5.0,,"Buddha Tooth Temple is located opposite the Maxwell Food Centre.
This review is meant for foreign travelers/visitors.

I may be wrong, but this temple appears to be of the Mahayana tradition.
Male and Female visitors are to note that you may need to dress (cover up) to prevent revealing of knees upwards and ladies need to cover up, if you are wearing slightly revealing tops like tank tops, singlets, sleeveless.
But not to worry, as there are some donated tops and bottoms that you can borrow at the two entrances, if you wish to enter the temple.
(Loan of the tops and bottoms are free of charge).

There is a Museum at the 3rd level (fully air-conditioned) where you can look at donated/loaned statues of Buddhas/Guan Yin, as well as sacred relics.
There is English, Chinese explanations of the exhibits.
A slow and detailed view of all the items will take about 1 hour to 1.5hours.

There is also a cafe serving VEGETARIAN diet at level B1 of this temple.
The entrances are on both sides of the temple (you need to walk about 15 steps down) or you can take the lift to level B1.
But do take note that the cafe closes at around 3pm everyday.
The items are served in fixed prices of about $3 or $4, depending on what items you choose.
Different menu items and soups are served everyday also.
Coarse rice usually runs out by early afternoon.
Do note that you need to CLEAR YOUR OWN TRAY and put them back at the the cafe.

Level 4 is the meditation room (fully air-conditioned) where the relics of Buddha is displayed. Do note that they have a daily routine where they may close it for maintenance and prayers (for about 15 mins).
The routine is around 12pm or 1pm.
In the meditation room, you can sit down and do your meditation (or chant your mantra/prayers quietly) but you are not allowed to sleep there.
(The security guard will ask you to leave if you sleep there).

TIP: The ""SECRET"" for this temple, which is also a MUST-SEE feature, is at the ROOFTOP garden.
Go to level 4 (the meditation room), look to your left for the stairs, then walk up 2 flight of stairs to reach the ROOF GARDEN.
Buddhists are recommended to pay your respects to the Buddhas at each of the four corners first.
The main feature is a GIANT PRAYER WHEEL in the centre.
I think the sanskirt/tibetan words read ""OM MANI PADME HUM"", the Mantra of Guan Yin.
Take your time to spin the prayer wheel in clockwise direction 7 rounds.
You exit via the stairs you came up from.

Visitors to take note that access to the level 4 meditation room and rooftop may be closed after 5pm!
The temple itself closes at about 7pm."

,,Stunning interiors,4.0,,"Love the architecture and garden at the top. I think the temple is beautiful and the gold encased main foyer is stunning. I think it is a hidden gem in Chinatown and I highly recommend it. Make sure to light an incense stick and visit the garden on the top.

It was actually recently constructed in the last decade, with its opening in 2007. The name is based on the presence of an apparent ‘Buddha tooth relic’ which is located on the 4th floor of the temple – although it is only viewed behind glass. Shoulders are to be covered but appropriate shawls are provided at the entrance.

I visited this temple mainly to add weight to my visit to Chinatown but I am not of the faith. On the positive side it is free to enter (donations encouraged) but if you are not Buddhist you will likely not appreciate the museum aspect of the visit or most of the relics on display. It is a nice structure but I couldn’t get over the feeling I was just wandering through someone else’s place of worship and I didn’t find it too exciting. The temple certainly has brought into the commercialism of tourist dollars, with some small market stalls within the temple and various gimic donations encouraged. Overall if you have been to asian temples before, it is miss able."
,,Must vist temple,5.0,,Must visit temple as it gives history about Lord Buddha and there are n number of statues of Buddha.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"If you come to this place you will find many Buddha statues that will tell about Buddha journey and character. But the statue I like best and it takes me a while to amaze it is the statue of Judge Bao.
Here we must give respect to other visitors since some of them really come to pray. But we can still enjoy the environment. Besides this place is peaceful.
I will surely visit this place again."
,,First timer - colorful and interesting,4.0,,"I've never been in a Buddhist Temple and everything was very interesting, but I did feel like I was intruding somewhere inappropriately even though tourists are obviously very welcome."
,,Very well kept!,5.0,,"The temple is so well kept, and nice! One can spend a while looking at all the little buddha statues on the walls."
,,A must see in Chinatown.,5.0,,This is a place you have to go in Chinatown. The access is free but do not forget to cover your shoulders before entering the sacred place.
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Impressive building in the middle of chinatown - you can't miss it! Colourful lanterns all around, didn't go inside."
,,Interesting yet touristy temple,5.0,,"This must be where all the tourists congregate in Chinatown. There were loads of them, however, if you can maneuver past all the people this is actually quite a beautiful temple. There's multiple levels but I personally preferred the top level. It has a roof top garden and a big spinning prayer wheel on top. I also enjoyed the 3rd level (no one was there, I was completely alone) which has lots of artifacts and teaches you about Buddah's life. I'm not religious but it was interesting to learn about.

You must have your legs and shoulders covered to go in but if you're not dressed appropriately they will give you a shawl to cover up. Overall a very beautiful temple and definitely worth a look while you're in Chinatown."
,,Beautiful modern Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"If like me you enjoy learning about other cultures and their beliefs you couldn't ask for a more beautiful environment to learn the history of Buddhism, see relics kept in pristine environments and appreciate the tranquility of the temple. Built in 2010, not only is there the ornate space for worship on level 1 but there are three additional floors (accessible by stairs or lift, don't miss these as they're very informative with lots of historical artefacts) and a rooftop garden. All free entry, likely a requirement to dress modestly but there seems to be shawls available to cover your knees and shoulders so don't worry about not being allowed in! Shorts are ok I think"

,,Nice,3.0,,Beautiful temple in China town area. Walk in and around it. There is also an upstairs area. Worth a visit
,,Speechless,5.0,,"This temple is a must see even if you aren't Buddhist/religious.

It's free entry by you can donate a few cents to dollars here, you can't take photos in here even though some people do, I suggested (from outside there's doors) to go to the roof as there's a small green with a spinning thing where you pray and you can see outside which is an incredible view

It's continently next to Chinatown and maxwells food centre which has great hainanese chicken"
,,INTERESTING BUDDHA HISTORY- worth a visit,5.0,,"This place keep one of the Buddha tooth relic at the top floor. free entry, hence you could drop by anytime if you are in chinatown.

,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing and spiritual place, make sure you take away some of the books so you too can find inner peace.
Easy to get to and absolutely beautiful, the garden on the top floor is so tranquil considering you are bang in the middle of Singapore. Well worth the visit."
,,Beautiful but it unfortunately made me feel rather uncomfortable.,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a popular attraction and a working place of worship for Buddhists. It was free to enter but we would have happily paid to visit. The interior is a riot of colour, with a preponderance of red and gold forming the background to the numerous stations of worship. An internal separate seated area allows worship for parishioners whilst visitors walk around, taking photographs on the outskirts of the building. The temple is beautiful, and the kaleidoscope of colour makes for some excellent photo opportunities. The roof garden is worth seeing to see and spin the world's largest Buddhist prayer wheel. My discomfort was when seeing the Buddhist visitors trying to pay their respects in prayer before a particular statue of worship whilst some unthinking visitors jostle for positions to take group photos in front of sacred statues. Perhaps a modicum of consideration for those for whom the temple is a place of worship would improve the situation for all. You will love it."
,,Beautiful Buddhist Temple,5.0,,If you are in Singapore Chinatown you must go see this temple. It is beautiful no matter what religion you practice. You can walk around inside and view from all sides. And you can take pictures inside.

,,Great Building,4.0,,"I came here too late, so I just can take the picture of the exterior. Very detail sculptures guarding the gate."
,,I'm blessed with the prayer,4.0,,Convenient location as it next to the china town. You can come unprepared as all the offering are available in the shrine.

,,Very beautiful temple in the heart of the city,4.0,,It is an old Buddhist temple to house the tooth relic of Lord Buddha. The interior of the temple is excellent.

,,"Amazing,",5.0,,I didn't go to the museum just because I didn't realise it was there but just the temple itself was incredible and I was so glad I decided to pop in at the last minute. I won't say more so I don't spoil it but it really is spectacular.
,,A must,5.0,,"Spent a whole morning visiting all floors ..free entrance, encahnting and full of information regarding Budda and all dieteies"
,,Stumbled into a service as it was beginning,5.0,,My spouse and I were attracted by the exterior and went inside to check it out. Beautiful temple. But what made it special is that a service was about the begin and we had never attended a Buddhist service. We stood and watched the chanting and offerings for perhaps 20 minutes. Fascinating!
,,Nice small garden on the top,4.0,,Nice buddist temple. All floors are interesting to visit. The real surprise was the nice garden on the top with the prayer wheel temple in the middle.
,,Great temple!,5.0,,"This temple is relatively new - the construction begin in the early 2000. This is very well put together and maintained. You need to make sure you are not showing your shoulder and no shorts - however, they do provide shaws and robes to cover your legs if needed."
,,Something different for us,5.0,,"We arrived at the Buddhist Temple and were able to go right inside. No fees, no fuse. You cannot wear your hat, however. It was such an authentic experience instead of a touristy one. Stand on the side and watch the service. Monks and every day folks from the city take part.
You are also able to wander around and look at the deities and get explanations. You might even find your sign according to their calendar. Take a camera. I found lots to photograph inside. So much red."

,,Another temple,3.0,,"We may have travelled to much in South-East Asia and seen just too many beautiful temples, thus this did not come to high on the list. It was an active ceremony while there, which added a touch. Ok for a detour, but perhaps nothing more."
,,Extremely nice temple in the middle of town.,5.0,,Walk inside and the atmosphere changes. A very active temple with a lot of visitors. A mix of tourists and locals. Several floors to climb and watch. We spend about one hour here.
,,Nice Visit if you are into Buddhism,4.0,,"There are a lot of art forms and religious materials in this building which you should not miss if you are very interested in the life of buddha and/or buddhism. Otherwise, skip this one."

,,the whole complex worth the visit,5.0,,"The temple, the museum, the meditation and prayer rooms. It is a must see place for everybody who values spirituality. Beautiful and friendly place for all sort of people not only for Buddhists"
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,"This is a gem. Truly beautiful Temple with alot to see.
There is alot of people mainly tourists in Temple so it can get crowded.

Also if your a man with small shorts."
,,Amazing and peaceful temple,5.0,,once enter to the Buddha tooth temple you will feel very peaceful and his is one of the best Chinese temple at Chinatown.
,,Very ornate,3.0,,"Curious to see why so named I went inside. Didn't find out. Beautifully decorated inside, numerous worshippers but as I'm not into Idolatry didn't stay long."
,,Beautiful even if you are not an expert,5.0,,"I used to work close to this place and I went almost once every week to visit for a little while. There is peace, beauty in this temple. Several floors and Too many people visit the first floor only. It is quite discreet but you can take the elevator to go up. The roof TOP which is my Favourite has a garden and more arts to see you have to access by stairs if my memory is correct but it is worth it. You can easily spend 45 to 1 hour if you like watching buddhas. Also great location in Chinatown so it is a must see if you are in the area. Enjoy!"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,I spent several visits here to learn and soak up the traditions. Many everyday people there were more than happy to talk about the history etc but there were some 'issues' with the language barrier but it didn't detract from the experience.
,,Tranquillity in the middle of China Town market,5.0,,"It was a lovely and calm after shopping in the China Town market. Beautiful statues and small museum on one of the upper floors. It has the largest prayer wheel in the temples roof garden, even if raining must see as you are under some cover."
,,Pretty typical chinese buddhist temple,4.0,,"I've seen my fair share of buddhist temple and this looks like a clean modern version of the od historic ones I've seen. I'm not sure how old this one is, but its like the disneyland of buddhist temples."
,,Another day another temple,3.0,,"Living in Thailand, I now suffer from an overkill of available temples. So I thought we would give the Buddha Tooth Relic temple a go. In Chinatown, it is easy to find, an impressive structure. Inside it really does have more of a museum feel, than of a working temple. Guards seem listless and un-interested. It is not clear where the Buddha Tooth relic is located, there is a lack of written literature explaining the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the Tooth Relic. Overall a disappointing visit."
,,Impressive island of peace,4.0,,"Even without the knowledge that would have made us appreciate more, or the belief that we don't have, we were impressed by the beauty and serenity of this temple/museum"
,,Very nice,4.0,,This is a beautiful temple that is definitely worth a visit. Everyone was very nice. It's also right next to Chinatown.
,,Don't see what the fuss is about,2.0,,I found that many more low key temples in Singapore were more special than this one. There is a security guard there who was very rude and seemed annoyed at having to let people in. Do yourself a favour and don't bother.
,,Temple taste,4.0,,"Visually [and spiritually] stunning. A nice touch was how they handled some tourists who may not have appreciated all the sensibilities and customs of the temple (i.e. covered arms, no hats etc) as they were discreet and practical in their approach."
,,Excellent cultural experience,5.0,,"Excellent cultural experience and dose of everyday worship. I do wish it weren't so much of a tourist-spot... But then, I too probably wouldn't have known of it. Enjoyed the prayer and chanting, as well as the overall museum experience. Great location in the midst of Chinatown, with Food Street and shopping etc right there too. After having visited some of the less popular and smaller Buddhist temples in Singapore, I personally prefer the less-touristy atmosphere of those. Another beautiful temple :)"
,,Wonderful trip,5.0,,It's a great Buddhist temple there with lots of relics of the Buddha and ancient historic artifact... loved the place and feeling blessed
,,Beautiful and calm,5.0,,Four storey building located at China Town is one of the major attractions. This temple is beautifully decorated from inside and outside. On the top floor is place where one can sit and meditate. Must to visit and explore the beauty and calmness.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,There is a lot of gold and more Buddha's than you can count. Worth a quick look if passing by but otherwise just another temple.
,,Another place that you should visit,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is located in China Town. There is no entrance Fee. Very popular place among tourists.
,,Good temple to visit,5.0,,Very different from other temples I have visited. It is mesmerising to see all the little statues covering the walls. There are several floors all fillies with interesting information. They provide items for the ladies to cover up which was good as otherwise would not be able to enter. One of the best temples I have seen. Definitely worth a visit.
,,The detail in this place is mind blowing,5.0,,"I am not a religious person but a visit to this place is a must just to see the detail of what people have done. Beautiful, perfect, how do humans do this? Just do yourself a favor and go and have a look!"
,,Stunning Temple,5.0,,"Absolutely Beautiful Temple, well worth a visit, so ornate, statues guarding the doorway, our guide gave a great explanation of the significance and religious background."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Wow!! I loved this temple. It is comprised of 4 floors and a rooftop. The fourth floor is the main event and took my breath away. No photos allowed on this floor. It is a stupa made of gold that houses the Buddha tooth. I found most people did not know there was an upstairs and the main floor was packed but found almost virtually no one on the other floors. The others contain old Buddhist artifacts and relics. I found the elevator/stairs at the entrance of the temple down a small corner on the right side. Make sure you see this place!!
,,Authentic as it gets,5.0,,"Hidden away in China town is this authentic Buddha temple.
Please be sure to respect the locals attending a service by covering bare shoulders and do not wear short shorts, you will be prohibited from entering what is sure to be a highlight of your visit. We visited while a service was in progress and it was interesting to see how this takes place.
Interesting place to visit no matter what your religion as it gives an insight into Buddhism."
,,Beautiful tenple,4.0,,The temple looks newly restored as everything is bright and shiny. Only had a short time to visit so only walked around the bottom floor. There are some higher floors with exhibits that can be accessed via the lift. Worth a visit if you have the time.
,,Great choice,5.0,,"We visited this temple per suggestion of one of my teenagers. It was definitely a nice experience. From the moment we arrived in Chinatown to the little fun walk to the temple, to visiting each and every floor. There is something for everyone to see here. Gardens and prayer wheels at the top level, the tooth relic at the 4th level where people can also meditate and find moments of peace, to a museum, and temple. It was very informative / interested and very close to great local food."
,,Stunning piece of history and culture,5.0,,"A must visit in Singapore. Even better if the Monks are chanting.
A bit of a climb to the top if you are not fully mobile and please respect religious nature of the building, ladies may be asked to wear a Sarong if too much skin is showing."
,,Not worth it,2.0,,If it was up yo me I would stay with visiting actual old temples with an aura of history and spiritualism. This one was kind of... cold and lifeless...
,,Interesting,5.0,,"If you are into Temples this is a good place to have a look around the staff were very helpful, ladies you will need to cover your shoulders but they do have scarves you can borrow plus the men must cover their legs if in shorts but again they have a skirt of sorts that you can use. Make sure go to the top of the Temple as there is an amazing garden there."
,,It's everything I expected,4.0,,"The temple is magnificent and overwhelming. There are sort of robes at the entrance for ladies who wear shorts, there's no need for men with knee high shorts.
You can take pictures inside without flash. I recommend reaching the fourth floor.
Outside you can find really cheap souvenirs and gift shops"
,,Wonderful but too much tourists!,4.0,,"Unfortunately, this is one of the places that is too crowded by tourists. Otherwise it is a beautiful temple."
,,This is my all time favorite temple!,5.0,,I visit this temple every day I'm in Singapore. The locals aren't even aware of the fact that the rooftop has the world's largest prayer wheel.
,,Simply the most ornate temple I have seen period !,5.0,,If your into very ornate places of worship then you must see this place in Singapore's China town. Now I'm not religious person but you have to take your hat of to these guys. It on the WOW side and quite humbling.
,,Amazing architecture & interior design!,5.0,,"This was my second time visiting this temple - first was in Jan 2013! It's an amazing peaceful temple. Buddhist statues are beautiful - culture and tradition are exhibited throughout with monks also present on site.
I enjoyed going around all fours levels, including the museum - which displayed Buddhism with various exhibits and artifacts."
,,Must See Attraction,4.0,,"This Temple is a must see during your visit to Singapore.

Located in Chinatown, it is the first place you should go before touring the surrounding neighborhood. The sense of serenity and peace you get even before you enter the Main Hall is must be experienced to be felt. Whether you are there for 15 minutes or an hour, there is so much to see and explore. The rich history of the Buddhist religion and the accurate replica of the architecture is eye-opening.

Must visit to believe."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,The colours and spectacle of this temple and museum are well worth making the effort to visit. The sheer number of Buddhas are mind blowing.

,,Worthwhile to visit,4.0,,"A rather interesting & educational visit, watching the monks going about their prayers & followers paying their respect to the different Buddhas.

,,Most visit if you are in Chinatown,5.0,,"Beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown. Lost of people visit it. Tourists are allowed to enter and take pictures. No sleeveless shirts allowed or hats. It is amazing the amount of work that went to build it. Since you are here, after your tour of the temple, cross the street to Maxwell Hawker Center. Go to stall 10/11 and order he next chicken rice in Singapore. You won't regret it."
,,Amazing inside,3.0,,"This Temple is a nice spot to visit if you are in the area. The outside is nothing spectacular honestly, but inside (free entry) is definitely worth a look! Gold Buddha’s and relics everywhere, and nice to read all about the religion and history."
,,Culture in Singapore,4.0,,"This is a beautiful and large temple with significant historical significance to Singapore. It gets busy and so I'd suggest going early to appreciate the serenity and grandeur this temple is capable of sharing.

It's a working temple and so sections can be blocked off at times but there are multiple floors each with their own stories.

It's right next to the Chinatown market and there are plenty of Resturant's and small bars around and markets where you can buy all the usual cheap gear.

Getting there using the train is surprisingly easy ..,my first time using it in Singapore but it won't be the last."
,,Intricate detailed art work on walls and ceiling.,4.0,,House of prayer with beautiful art work. Buddha sits serene in the central hall where prayers are offered. No sleeveless dresses allowed within the temple. Women with sleeveless dresses may cover their shoulders with a shawl or scarf.

The temple itself is a work of art, colourful, decoratively painted walls and ceilings, brilliantly lighted lanterns and the highlight- thousands of miniature Buddha sculptures, each one uniquely crafted.

The divine ambience enriched by a stream of devotees and curious visitors transformed as little Buddhas (as gentle as can be) may be for a short while."

,,"Buddha tooth relic temple, Singapore",4.0,,"A well decorated four storey and mezzanine with plenty of beautiful sculptures and statues made of stone, metal and wood mainly collected from Cambodia and India along with a row of relics of Buddha. Major attraction being the tooth relic kept in a gold vessel. Inspire of the crowd one can sit and meditate there. You can spend two hours easily. No entry fee."
,,A beautiful Buddhist temple,5.0,,"A peaceful place to sit and contemplate. The rooftop garden is worth the climb up from the 4th floor, with a very large prayer wheel and 10,000 small buddhas. Located close to Chinatown this temple is worth a visit."
,,Stunning Temple,5.0,,This temple is located heart of Chinatown. Up on entrance it has a nice big main hall Very beautiful and must visit in Singapore. It is 5-7 minutes’ walk from china town MRT.
,,Amazing temple,1.0,,"Wow to see Buddha's tooth is tranquil, however the temple itself has turned in to a gift shop with racks and selfs full of merchandise and it till this really should not be in the inner sanctum off the temple what a disappointment, this should all be outside."
,,Tooth Relic Temple,4.0,,Very beautiful temple filled with worshippers praying and chanting when I visited belief this added to the atmosphere well worth a visit
,,Lovely Buddhist temple,5.0,,This is a lovely Buddhist temple said to house a broken tooth of Buddha. This is good to incorporate with more activities for the day as the visit isn't time consuming. It houses some beautiful statuary.
,,A First Timer at this Huge Buddhist Temple,5.0,,I love Buddhist pearls of wisdom as they guide my life(and the Dalai Llama's books...) but really don't know all the different branches and had never been in a Buddhist Temple. At the time we went in with our long wrap over our shorts(provided)and witnessed part of a service before we toured the museum or most of the building.So much to see...a must go back to see several times....A docent tour would have been nice but we didn't check on it.Impromptu awesome visit!
,,Worthwhile,5.0,,"Took the metro to get here, then was an easy walk. Upon entering the temple we lit incense sticks and said a prayer. We then found ourselves in a room with astrological dieties along the perimeter and large statues of deities in the front. On each side of these large statues were 2 beautiful lotus screen paintings. There were candle offerings and people were praying. We then walked into the 2nd room after looking up our astrological deity, which was interesting to read about.

The 2nd large room off of the first was very beautiful and had many intricate sculptures in the walls, and the sculptural deities in the front on a dias were spectacular.

We then took the elevator up to each floor. ON the 2nd floor, were many artifacts, quite old, of various deities. The 3rd floor had more of this type of thing, old and valuable, and this is where the real relics are located, at the back. No photography of relics. You enter the room (shoes still on at this point) and you can view beautiful glass and gold vessels which hold different parts of the crystalized remains of the Buddha. There were blood, intestines, liver, etc. It was very extraordinary. I have never seen anything like this.

ON the 4th floor, you remove your shoes. You then enter a carpeted temple area. We heard the monks singing. There was a big gold screen which lowered down and behind this was the actual tooth relic. We just missed seeing it, but they have a photo on display. No photos allowed. The room was beautiful and the monks were singing because a monk was leaving so they closed this temple area at 5:30 instead of 6.

On the roof was a beautiful garden, and then in a structure, a large prayer wheel. All in all, this was a beautiful experience."
,,Never been inside a temple before,4.0,,We have never been inside a buddhist temple and went here as part of a walking tour of the city. Our guide explained the etiquette. The inside was beautiful and a mix of tranquility and activity. Glad we went.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"My first visit to a Buddhist Temple, a working temple with scholars working amongst the tourists. Beautiful statues and alters to see, a quiet and respectful experience to have"
,,Large Temple,5.0,,"We stopped by as we saw it on the way to China Town. We were very impressed by the size and beauty of the Temple. Don't wear skimpy clothing, but longish shorts are ok. We didn't feel unwelcome at all, even though there were a lot of people worshipping at the time."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"At a recent conference a group of people wanted to go out for dinner so we decided to go to this Temple and wander around the area before dinner.
I'd never though to go to this temple before though I'm told its one of the largest.
There was some festival going on so it was very busy but that only added to the great atmosphere.
Well worth the visit if you are in the area."
,,Peaceful and Insightful,5.0,,"Set in the heart of Chinatown, this temple offers an easy and relaxing way to learn about and witness Buddhist teachings and rituals. It's also a nice oasis from the intensity of the city."
,,Working Buddist Temple delight,5.0,,"When I am in Chinatown i like to pop in and visit this temple as it is always a breath of relaxation and wonder. Everytime I visit there is something different going one, always an abudance of colour, vibrancy and incense. Orchid garden on top floor a must."
,,Buddhist temple in the town,5.0,,This temple is in the Chinatown. It's very beautiful and it has five/ four stories. There are plenty wax statues of monks available.
,,Amazing experience walked in during a prayer session and was unbelievable. Culturally enriching and visually spectacular,5.0,,"We walked in during a prayer session and were welcomed with open arms. The temple itself is devine, and the amount of work put into it and the museum is very impressive. Cost free as well which is pretty unbelievable considering what a good job is done. A hidden gem just outside of china town. A must see!!"
,,Kul,3.0,,The temple looks like the chinese museum with the attrative red coulour that explores you to see *the histories of china town with old pictures *the manific statues of boudha and chinese gods *the meditation area *the quiet chinese garden on the top roof
,,A lovely temple.,3.0,,"We started at this temple before heading out elsewhere for the day. It's lovely fresh and airey, and they are very welcoming of tourists provided that you adhere to their codes of behaviour. A lovely place to go and meditate."
,,A real live working temple,5.0,,I was so suprised I was allowed to take photographs here as there was a religious event taking place when I was there. This is a very stimulating and beautifully ornate place and must not be missed.
,,You don't actually get to see the tooth relic,3.0,,We arrived at the temple at 10.45 (more by luck than judgement) only to discover that the area containing the tooth relic is closed from 11 am to about 6.30 pm daily. We rushed in and were shoved through with the crowds until we reached the small opening where you can see through to the big silver/gold (couldn't tell as we were shoved past it so fast) container that holds the relic. No photos of the container are allowed. Overall it was a disappointing experience other than to say we've been.
,,Enchanting,4.0,,"Only a couple of minutes easy walk from Chinatown, this temple was full of monks and others doing their mesmerising chant. You don't have to take your shoes off, but there is a modest dress code - don't worry, they have scarves and other items should you need them. You can take photos. The layout, information and history is wonderful - really worth the time to see (only cost is any donation you care to make)."
,,Beatiful and fascinating Buddhist temple in Chinatown,5.0,,"The temple open to the public and is spread across 5 floors. I bumped into a friendly local who took me around the temple for free explaining the significance of the relics etc. Surprisingly the temple is only 10 years old. There are 10,000 buddhas lining the walls, each one costing SGD68. There is a 400kg solid gold Buddha on the top floor along with the Buddha tooth. The temples meditation room is also open to people of all faiths. Dress appropriately when visiting - knees and shoulders should be covered. There are shawls available at the temple to use as cover ups."
,,Great Temple!,5.0,,"This temple in chinatown, the locations is near from backpackers inn hostel, chinatown food complex, and unfortunatelly I'm late to visit here.. I've visited here at night and there's event in Sunday night :("
,,STUNNING BOOK A TOUR GUIDE,5.0,,"Buddah Tooth Relic Temple is stunning with all the sculptures of the various Buddhist gods, it is well looked after this is a must see visit all the floors an make sure to book in advance your tour guide on the website they are volunteers, we did not our mistake we missed out on the seeing the Garden upstairs an other sites we did not know where available to us.
admission is free tour guide is free it is a beautiful temple to walk through a donation for the monks keeping it so well looked after would not go astray."
,,A Buddhist temple as temple is beyond a tripadvisor review,2.0,,"but as a ""sight"" it is not, and here the spirituality becomes an issue. Now, the BTRT is decorative, but it is decorative because it is very new, it is built basically as a stage decoration, a movie setting - that is why a certain type of tourists likes this. Spiritually, I am not calm enough that the pushing and shoving hordes of Aussie tour groups and the armies of Spanish backpackers who mind if your presence disturbs their tacky selfies wouldn't annoy me. So for me, this is the opposite of a must, both touristically and spiritually, and I think avoiding it is a good idea."
,,Another interesting Temple,4.0,,"We enjoyed walking about this one with its many many Buddhas. The main hall is just so colourful and has a very 'rich' feel about it. They do ask you to cover up here, this is how it is but you just have to be respectful and they are very welcoming.

Great visit, very interesting and you get to see all the worshippers, in the middle of the hall bookbinding and praying. A reall insight into another region, loved it."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Impressively large. A modern temple that is well explained. Dress appropriately though they will lend you cover ups.
,,Great Buddhist temple,4.0,,"Make sure you visit the fourth floor . Nicest temple in Singapore, however many tourist bus drop offs. Tremendous temple to get to understand the various buddhas and the history of Buddhism. Definitely worth the visit."
,,interesting,4.0,,Visited with my son and had learned a lot from our tour guide. Nice to visit with a tour guide so you'd know about the relic and other interesting things going on.
,,Do Not Miss,5.0,,"If you only visit one of the many temples in Chinatown be sure it is this one. Spread over 5 floors it is amazing, especially the tooth relic room which is solid gold!"
,,must see,5.0,,"Must see, do go inside, and also visit more floors, then just the ground floor. One of the few impressive budhist temples outside china"
,,A nice temple for a good photo.,4.0,,A nice temple to get a photo of and look around. Hard to get excited after you have seen so many other temples.
,,Beautiful architecture with lots of details,5.0,,"Is in Chinatown and the building houses a museum about Buddhism and is also a place for worship. The building is inspired by the Tang dynasty and the detailing of the interior came mainly from China and Japan. You can also get very good vegetarian food at the basement during lunch at reasonable price. Please note that the dress code is not to have outfits that expose your shoulders and knee. Having said, they also provide scarves for visitors who wish to enter the interior. Admission is free."
,,Must visit Temple in Chinatown,5.0,,"Beautiful place of worship and appreciation for Buddhism practice. Make sure to visit the garden on the roof as well. You can also meditate in the Relic room. It is a bit chilly from the air con so bring something to keep you warm.

There are also vegetarian meals available in the dining areas below. Closes at 3 PM sharp.

Looking for tranquility during your travels in Singapore? If yes, then don't miss this lovely sight.

Cheers!"
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"Can as a tourist, and found the information on display very interesting and I learnt a lot at Buddism from the museum. The temple itself is very beautiful. It is a free entry attraction"
,,Interesting piece of culture,3.0,,"We stopped by here while on a food tour in Chinatown. On the first floor, you can walk around and find your zodiac and related god. Take the elevator up to see the tooth relic. No photography is permitted. We were there around 4 pm and it was not very crowded. However, our guide mentioned it can be very crowded in the mornings."
,,Interesting.,3.0,,We visited this around the Chinese new year period . It was busy with lots happening and there was no charge. Worth a visit if you are close by.
,,Old vintage temple,5.0,,This is one of the most beautifully done vintage temple and by default it's gonna be a part of your trip to Singapore it's beautifully done and very Chinese a must visit
,,Nice,5.0,,Free entry nice relics and Buddha's picture taking is allowed in the temple but for museum there are restricted area for photos nice experience
,,A place of serenity,3.0,,"After the crash and heat of China Town, the visit to the temple allowed the senses to recharge. The temple is free and air conditioned. The paintings and carvings were beautiful and you had something of beauty to look at all over the temple. The statues that lined the walls were calming. The flower offerings gave the temple a fresh, sweet smell. This is definitely the place to visit to find some inner calm on a busy day."
,,"Buddhas, incense and kitsch",3.0,,"The temple is a big tall and ugly building in the middle of Chinatown with a main hall all gold and red, hundreds (thousands?) of little buddha statues covering the side walls,
big incense burners at the main entrances, smaller statues in the smaller hall including warriors with Chinese zodiac hats (go and find yours), Buddha on a white elephant, Buddha on a giant lotus, the statue of a blue wise king and two very camp and angry states of wardens outside the main entrance.
Though it is worth a visit my overall impression was of an over-the-top temple of kitsch more than a place of worship.
I did not visit the museum and the upper floor rooms."
,,Peaceful Template within Chinatown,4.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a peaceful retreat from the busy nature of Chinatown. It's a lovely temple, with a dramatic red exterior that stands out."
,,Calm temple,4.0,,"Provides an opportunity to meditate and introspect. Far away from the maddening crowd. However, this place gets crowded in evenings."

,,Amazing Temple.,5.0,,"The local place you must visit in China Town Singapore, very beautiful,interesting temple and peaceful."
,,It's really beautiful,4.0,,"It's so worth going to and make sure you go to every floor. I had a few favourites here...the tapestry was magnificent, and the garden on the roof on the fourth floor was gorgeous. There's a lovely man who makes you turn the bell for good luck...here's hoping!"
,,nice place near china town,4.0,,"great to see such a wonderful architecture and temple.very near to it you will find china town market where you can buy things in cheaper rates,back side of temple you will find marline statue"
,,nice Temple but even better museum,4.0,,We live in Beijing and we went here only because we thought it was something we should do. We were surprised by what we found: a great three floors museum of Buddhism with few but very selected art pieces. The display is very good and everything is well explained. the temple itself is also worth the visit and the garden at the rooftop is another surprise. Definetly a nice choice!
,,Must see ! Highly recommended.,5.0,,"There are 4 levels to explore with very nice ambience. Take the time to explore every floor of this beautiful temple, relaxed and calm atmosphere. Please bear in mind it is a place of worship- you will be offered covering for your legs and shoulders if they are not already covered."

,,Good - quick visit on our way to the airport and nice restaurants close by,4.0,,Quick visit as was next to a Michelin star restaurant we were heading to. Quite a nice attraction/temple and worth a look about for 30 minutes or so even for non-Budhists - photos give an idea of what you will see - it's free too.
,,Must visit place on a tour of Singapore,5.0,,"We visited Buddha tooth relic temple during the morning hours. There is a dress code for the visit. Though one can get the required body cover clothing on the entrance.
How can one utilise the visit:
Start by visiting the ground floor temple. The golden statues presents a mesmerising view. After ground floor one should go straight to the rooftop garden and then climb down each floor by stairs and in this sequence one can truly understand the temple and museum.
After the visit one can really get a good insight on Buddhism and return enlightened."
,,Peaceful and Calm,4.0,,"A fantastic and calm experience. Check out the temple, it doesn't take long, but the history and information on Buddha and Buddhism is great. Also, it is right next door to some fabulous Chinatown shopping."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"We came for the photography but stayed because of the feeling whilst inside.

A serene location surrounded by the hustle and bustle of Chinatown.

If you're into photography this is a stellar location for both day and night shoots.

There are sarongs available incase you're not dressed appropriately.

It was free to enter but there is the opportunity to make donations whilst there.

Inside the temple there is an impressive display of Buddhist religious architecture.

Be mindful this is a place of worship so there will be those people attending to pay their respects.

We would definitely visit again."
,,Top Singapore attraction. Highly recommended.,5.0,,"This temple was built ten years ago to house a tooth of the Buddha found in a ruined temple in Myanmar (Burma). Please bear in mind it is a place of worship- you will be offered covering for your legs and shoulders if they are not already covered, but you may be turned away if not appropriately dressed. The building is spectacular (and air-conditioned!), and its 4 floors include a museum of buddhist artefacts and the room of the tooth relic(no shoes please). The ceremonial space on the ground floor is wonderfully atmospheric if there is a ceremony taking place. Entry is free.
Nearby is the Chinatown complex with its first floor food stalls providing a cornucopia of cheap and tasty food and drink. Highly recommended."
,,Praying and explore the museum,5.0,,"Very nice temple and museum,get to explore many .. peaceful and nice environments.. located in the heart of Chinatown .."
,,Interesting building inside and out.,5.0,,We visited during the end of the Chinese New Year and the outside of the building was decorated with beautiful silk flowers. The architecture is amazing and the inside of the Temple could take hours to closely look at everything.
,,Beautiful peaceful temple,5.0,,"Very welcoming, interesting and serene make sure you visist the 4th floor where the reliic of the tooth is kept and walk up to the roof garden and the huge prayer wheel can be found"
,,A centre of calmness in a busy city,5.0,,"Take the time to explore every floor of this beautiful temple, and relax among the plants on the top floor, watching the devotees as they spin the prayer wheel. The opulence of the shrines on display might be a surprise, but there seems to be a pervading calmness throughout the temple that is very therapeutic."
,,Place that gives you inner peace,5.0,,"There are 4 levels to explore with very nice ambience. Is air conditioned so roaming around this place is really a Breeze. Give yourself more time when planning your trip here so you could take time to appreciate each level leisurely. Explore level 4, a rooftop garden where there are seats around for you to enjoy the greens. I will plan to come again."
,,A must,5.0,,Amazing experience as we visited during a prayer session. No cost to get in and loads of interesting things to look and read about. Beautiful roof top gated with easy access for all.

,,Unexpected,5.0,,We stumbled upon this while in chinatown. Walked in to a totally amazing and restful place...was a good place to immerse in another time and culture
,,Lovely,4.0,,"Located on the edge if chinatown, this is a meeting spot for lots of tours around 9am and 6pm so it can get crowded. We were lucky enough yo be there as the monks were praying about midday.

Ladies please cover shoulders and wear a longer skirt or pants or take a sarong to cover up if you want to go in. Men please remove hats. Lots of people pray and burn incense at the entrance."
,,Peaceful Holy Place,5.0,,Excellent and Peaceful Place. Very well maintained and must visit. Go before 6 pm as the Golden Buddha on 4th floor and terrace closes at 6 pm.
,,Historical,4.0,,"Worth taking a walk through this huge temple, complete with monks and worshipers. Very intricate, and a very good example of the predominant religion"
,,"Nice stop off, it's free!",4.0,,"If you are taking in Chinatown, this is a good stop off. The building is ornately decorated and a pretty cool site. Also, it is air conditioned so if you are in Chinatown on a hot day, it is a good place to cool off."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"We felt welcomed at this temple. The displays of the history were comprehensive and educational. The temple itself is lovely - reverential, joyful and meditative."
,,Interesting,5.0,,It was interesting museum to visit right in Chinatown. Huge museums with free reading materials. Clean restrooms and A/C were a plus. There's a strict dress code -- no shorts and tanks allowed so bundle up!
,,Big temple ...,3.0,,... but not that special. New big and a little boring. You might prefer to finde a older smaller temple another place in the city.
,,Definitely a place to visit,4.0,,"Looking at this building reminds one of ancient Chinese palace which is majestic in stature and eye catching. It is very peaceful inside and lot of beautiful wooden sculptures of various Gods that are intricately hand carved.
It is very close to 'China Town' MRT. Alight here and walk through numerous stall filled street to reach this place. Overall, a wonderful experience."

This is a must see for visitors, walk around the main floor, take the lift yo the fourth floor to see the actual relic and a beautifully decorated room, no cameras allowed there, then walk up one flight if stairs to the Orchid Garden and see the huge Wheel of Fortune that spins"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"This Buddhist temple was extraordinary. It was wonderful to see the architectural design and a visit to the roof cannot be missed. Serenity, charm, authenticity and spiritualness abound in this place. Try to not go here as a tourist without understanding that this is still a place of worship and thus people must do things like remove their shoes in the sanctuary and cover up (no sleeveless shirts/dresses or shorts).
If you want a mystical experience, see this temple. It is not far from the China Town transit stop. Well worth the journey."
,,WOW,5.0,,We were staying near chinatown and came across the temple. WOW is an understatement. I felt at peace here and astonished by the monks reading. It was an extremely powerful place to be and we thoroughly enjoyed looking around and taking everything in
,,Excellent and authentic experience,5.0,,I went to see this temple on Saturday and witness the service in progress which was great. It is amazing that they can accommodate both religious attendees and countless tourists. It is easy to miss the best part of this temple if you don't find the lift of stairs leading to a few more floors. My personal highlight was the museum of Buddhism and orchid garden on the top floor. Absolutely must visit for all Singapore tourists.
,,BUDDIST TEMPLE WITH A TOOTH FROM BUDDA,5.0,,The temple is a landmark in Chinatown. It was very busy but not overcrowded. This is an active temple with several different areas to explore. The tooth relic is not on the main floor and is not easy to access. Highly recommend. Hope this helps..
,,memorizing temple,5.0,,Beautiful temple in the middle of china town humbling spiritusl place. dress modestly but wraps provided for women wander around the temple and see locals visit for a private prayer

,,It’s Worth Exploring the Whole Place!,5.0,,"We specifically set out to see this temple and are glad we did. It is large and you have access to several floors of museum and relic space. Shoes off and cover up before accessing temple areas. Besides the tooth there is a lot of information and historical background provided. We ended up staying a couple of hours, far longer than planned."

,,Mystical,5.0,,A huge Temple right in the heart of China town..very impressive. When we entered a religious ceremony was ongoing. The colours and smell of incense were amazing. Tourist were allowed to remain during the ceremony with was a great thing to see. The work on the interior decor is amazing
,,An overwhelming Experience,5.0,,"I have visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple a few times now since 2012. Although I am not a practising Buddhist, the first time I visited the temple I found it a truly overwhelming experience. The huge statues in the main hall on the ground floor are incredible, and the atmosphere is breathtaking. There are a number of floors to explore including a museum of Buddhist artifacts, but the floor housing the actual relic is absolutely a must-see in a way I really can't describe. It is a genuinely amazing place, and there are areas here that you can sit and meditate if you so wish. Also be sure to visit the roof top garden and the giant prayer wheel up there - a very beautiful and peaceful place to experience in the middle of bustling Chinatown."
,,Huge and mystical,5.0,,"Several floors accessible by elevator, many people praying, very beautiful especially the hall of the relic. Right in the heart of Chinatown."
,,"Near China Town, Worth a visit if you are already in China Town.",3.0,,"If you are visiting China Town then it's worth paying a visit to this temple. Although it's a modern temple, build in 2007, it certainly looks old and traditional. There's a dress code so make sure you cover legs down to your knees and cover your shoulders."
,,A Chinatown highlight,5.0,,We were lucky enough to arrive here during a religious ceremony which was very interesting to witness. The temple has a very generous policy allowing tourists to take photos and film without restriction. Shawls etc are provided at the entrance to allow you to cover up appropriately. We came to Chinatown specially to visit the temple and it certainly lived up to our expectations.
,,Lovely,4.0,,Nice place for a stroll around......but I'm a sucker for Chinese temples so I may be biased! Worth a visit
,,Quick visit very solemn,4.0,,We have quick visit in the temple. Relics are amazing and some are giving respect. Need to observe proper dress upstair

Then use this place as a starting point for visiting and roaming around Chinatown.
Definitely Recommend"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The inside is stunning, but you can not show shoulders or too much legs, so try not to wear shorts or skirt..however they do have covers there. I would highly recommend stopping by this place."
,,Must-visit in SG?,5.0,,"It is one of the few temples where they allow you to photograph and video-rcord even the inside of the temple. There is a dresscode but the temple provides sarongs and shawls. It is incredibly tourist friendly with touch-screen navigation and elevators. Be ready to be humbled by the live chanting on the first floor, and then head to the multi-floor museums, one of which houses the tooth relic of Buddha. While relic area is a no photgraphs zone, some floors allow no-flash photography. The entire building is PWD-friendly. Lastly, this temple is also hime to the largest cloissone Buddha Prayer Wheel in the world. No entance fees, but feel free to donate for the temple's upkeep."
,,Incredible experience,4.0,,Free admission to an active temple. Beautifully kept. Must take time to read the myriad informational plaques around the site.
,,Peace at its Best!!!,5.0,,"Budhha tooth relic temple is one of the best & must visit places if you are around Chinatown. The temple offers a unique insight into the origin of Budhha Religion & different celestial Buddhas as per the scriptures of Mahayana Buddha (apologies if any of my references are incorrect)... But visit to this temple, the prayers, offers a serene ambiance amid chaos of life. Do spend couple of hours enjoying the beauty at its best.."
,,"Beautiful Temple, great history",5.0,,"If you enjoy Temples and history, great place to visit, in Chinatown, close to lots of Activity, shops, restaurants etc"
,,Magical temple,5.0,,"It is beautiful in and out.A main attraction in Singapore.Free.No shorts or shirts without sleeves allow you can cover yourself with some skirts they offer at the entrance of the temple.Pictures allow, don't miss the upper floors with the bell and roof garden also museum.Easy a least 2 hours to enjoy.Recommended."

,,Culturally different,4.0,,Visited when there was a dedication to the monks so everywhere was in full spectacular colourful splendour.
,,Came upon by accident but worth going I'm.,4.0,,"We had read about this temple, but we were pleasantly surprised on how much detail it contains. Please note it is a active temple and please have respect for the people practicing their faith. I see a lot of people walking through without regard to people praying. You have to go through the entire temple to appreciate all of the small buddhas as well as the larger ones.
If your in the area I suggest you stop in and enjoy."
,,Unusually interesting temple-cultural center,5.0,,"I always take visiting friends here. A visit to BTRTM (whether or not one is religious) offers a variety of meaningful, engaging experiences. First, the temple area proper is impressive in size and decor, with a great hall centered on sizeable Sakyamuni Buddha, often you can witness ceremonies and chanting. It is lined with countless small Buddha figures, and offers bilingual signage. Second, the museum on the 3rd floor is well thought out, rich in sculptures especially from various countries and centuries. It is organized sequentially along the stages of Buddha's life, e.g. Sculptures depicting his youth are shown alongside passages about that stage of his life (English/Chinese). I learned a lot and felt very peaceful following this narrative journey of words and art. Third, the 5th floor with the tooth relic offers a serene and cool meditation area. A monk is often there. The tooth relic is set far behind a large glass window so it is a bit hard to view. Fourth, the orchid garden on the roof is very nice with a huge prayer wheel (mani wheel) that you can spin. Fifth, there are good vegetarian lunches served in the basement for a donation on weekdays. Sixth, the life size wax figures of famous monks on the mezzanine are sppokily fascinating. And lastly, it is air conditioned, which means something on a hot day of sightseeing in the central business district. This and the nearby URA gallery are atypical yet worthwhile visitor attractions that my visiting friends have enjoyed."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The temple and the roof gardens are beautiful. The art work and decorations inside are breathtaking. The colors, the statues, the carvings - just gorgeous. Must-visit while in Singapore."
,,Temple and museum in one!,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth is a great way to explore the Singaporean take on Buddhism, and is a sight to behold, both inside and outside. On the second floor they also have a museum explaining the religion, which is absolutely worth it if you have the time (it's also free!). The temple also gives out some really good free books on a range of different topics for those interested in learning more!"
,,must visit,5.0,,"When you get tired of the modern & vivid Singapore, drive to China Town! first - there you'll enjoy great prices for everything)) Second - there you'll find a very pearl of Singapore - Buddha's temple. I found my way there taking a HopOnHopOff. The Temple itself is ""new"", built in 2004 or something like this. But it is an extremely atmospherical place & it is a must visit, doesn't matter if you are keen on buddhism or not. Plenty of open areas to visit, very welcoming, very inspiring, very beautiful. Gives you another feeling & another side of full-of-contrasts Singapore"
,,Modern buddhist temple,5.0,,"a modern Buddhist temple that marries Buddhism, culture and life style. Worth to visit to understand Buddhism better!"
,,Very insightful- beautiful temple,5.0,,"The temple itself is very beautiful and worth a visit. However, to me, the exhibitions upstairs were the real attraction. Very well-done!! I learned a lot about the Buddhist religion, it's history and symbols. Highly recommended!"
,,amazing,5.0,,This is a must see in Chinatown even if you do not have an interest in Buddhism. Simple stunning inside and you are allowed to take photographs
,,Mandatory stop in Chinatown,4.0,,"The temple is beautiful from outside and amazing inside. Many images, good lighting and cool energy. There is a garden in the rooftop and one exhibition of objects and real size wax statues of many masters. A good stop to rest from busy Chinatown."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a remarkable four-storey temple. When entering the gate, you’ll immediately notice the stunning main hall with its high ceiling. It is located at 288 South Bridge St. It opens at 7am and closes at 7pm and is free of charge. The bell tower and drum tower are on the same floor. However, the main focus for most visitors is the solid gold two-metre stupa on the fourth floor which is the place where the sacred relic is kept.

From an exhibition on the building of the temple on the 2nd floor, a wonderful section on the life of Buddha on the third, the Buddha tooth relic on the 4th and the rooftop garden with a huge prayer wheel on the fifth. What a delightful building! We spent over an hour in there exploring.

,,Worth coming to see,5.0,,This temple in the heart of Smith st market is stunning and they are happy to let you take videos and photos. Be warned ladies need to wear clothes to cover knees.

,,Fascinating temple,4.0,,A must see attraction when in Singapore Chinatown. Beautiful architecture and an insightful into local culture. Free to visit.
,,A magnificent temple,4.0,,"Visited during a ceremony and the atmosphere inside was mesmerising.
Visitors are, it seems, always welcome and our presence did not disrupt or demean the spirituality of the occasion.
There were seemingly no restrictions on taking photos inside and I found this refreshingly different to most religious establishments.
The building is beautiful both inside and out and definitely a place to visit."
,,Exquisitly beautiful,5.0,,We were fortunate to be there for a New Year's Service. We were encouraged to take pictures everywhere except the room holding the tooth. Beautiful rooms beyond belief.

,,Drop In if Passing,3.0,,"Not worth going especially for but if you found yourself in Chinatown or you are interested in Chinese Bubhism it would be well worth visiting.

,,Good,3.0,,"It's a temple so if you haven't seen many then it's possibly a highlight But thought it was ok, we didn't stay long as it was a bit same same"
,,Only visit if you are in Chinatown!,3.0,,"If you are familiar with seeing temples then you can skip this place. However, if you are in Chinatown then you may as well visit. It's a newly built temple (2007), so there is no history behind the temple itself. Inside the temple you can find historic artefacts of the Buddha, so this is where you should explore.
In terms of location, it is convenient, but not impressive. It's located on a main road with lots of traffic, so the surroundings are not aesthetically pleasing.
It is worth a visit if you are in Chinatown, but I wouldn't plan a trip around this attraction."
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"This is a beautiful Temple and museum. There are many beautiful, gilded Buddhist images and displays. But I was expecting to see more teeth."
,,"Buddha Tooth Temple, Sout Bridge Road",3.0,,"We found it a very artificial place (although architecture was quite impressive) and it felt very commercial i.e. get your money out and donate. It's a relatively new building, so there is no history to it.
By all means go and visit, but if you are anything like us you will be leaving in 20 minutes.
However, it's a great location as you can go and get snacks in China Town (Smith Street), go to the wet market and visit the nearby Hindu Temple and Mosque, which we found far more interesting."
,,Beautiful and make sure to get to the top,4.0,,"The temple itself is well worth the visit if you are in Chinatown. Each floor offers something interesting to see, and I have to say that the roof gardens and the pray wheel on the top floor was my favorite."
,,Stunning addition to Chinatown,5.0,,"Although not as old as you would like to imagine, this Buddhist Temple is a beautiful addition to Chinatown. At CNY in particular the temple is very busy, but guided tours are held weekly all through the year. The main area is stunningly decorated with large amounts of gold. Very impressive.

Pashminas and sarongs are available for covering shoulders and legs so anyone can visit."
,,A feast to the eye with all the gold foil work and the grandness of it,5.0,,"It is located in the middle of the city but none the less it is very captivating as soon as you get inside the building, it is 3 floors and the idols are very beautiful.
All the intricate work and the grandness is amazing.
The top floor where the Buddha tooth is key is a very quiet but very peaceful and positively energized area, sacred and quiet.
Even if u are not a believer in religion u must visit to see the faith and devotion of others to appreciate that.
We got a glimpse of some chanting and prayers on the main floor which was very interesting to watch as well the beautifully decorated offerings to GOD was interesting to see as well.
U should not be wearing a sleeveless dress or shorts.
Their are sarongs or cloth to cover if u do end up going without knowing that."

,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,5.0,,"Temple is quite new, but it is give you nice impression of Buddhist Temple. There is Buddha museum on 3rd floor which require a lot of time if you want to read everything. Also there is big collection of Buddha statues and other relics.
And Temple has a nice rooftop garden.
In my opinion it is one of the beautiful temples in Singapore."
,,Quite an imposing building,4.0,,"We didnt go inside this temple, but it is a beautiful building from outside and good for photographs. It is in China town, and has lots of visitors. I believe that visitors should take this shoes off if entering the temple to show respect."

,,Carfully designed to present Buddism from past to present history and Buddha's path,5.0,,"This multi story temple is well planned. Each level is unique. Altars, statues, historic amulets, clay artifacts, library, meditation stations and pray stalls. One level traces Buddha entire life chronologically, amazing and very educational. The entire building is open to the public at no cost. Contributions are welcome. Easy to find near Chinatown and the visitors info center. All bus connections can be made in the same block. The displays are in English and Asian and very detailed. The statues and altars are of exquisite craftsmanship. A very peaceful environment for everyone to experience"

,,Nice place but crowed,3.0,,Visited during chinese new year. Difficult to appreciate because there were too many people. Maybe at another time and with a guide to explain it would be better.
,,Dr. Strange,3.0,,"I have been to a lot of temples around the world but this temple was very intricate when you step into the actual room where the buddha tooth relic is, no pictures allowed in this room but the best way I can describe this is like walking into the scene of the Marvel movie Dr. Strange when he walks into the temple to ask for help. If you haven't seen this movie just know that it is crazy beautiful and intricate! The rest of the temple is also interesting to walk through. Good to visit just so you can say you've been here!"
,,Peaceful,4.0,,"It's not like south Asian Buddha temple. It's seems as Mahayana Buddha..any way it's very peaceful. and located in China town. Admission free; photograph is allowed, Also wear gently/ long."
,,"Lovely, old temple in Chinatown",4.0,,"Well worth a visit, please note all visitors must dress respectfully, my partner had to wear one of the temples stock of old, baggy trousers ! The monks were chanting when we visited and it gave the whole place a mystical atmosphere. You are allowed to get close to many of the temple areas and sculptures and they lend themselves to many great photo opportunities"
,,Interesting to see!,5.0,,This is an active temple- there was a service going on the day we were there. Gorgeous decoration. Interesting history.
,,Another temple but well worth doing!,4.0,,"OK, on our trip we did several temples be they Muslim, Buddhism or a.n.other but this was up there as one of the best! It took the level of opulence to the next level and all the floors we visited offered stunning figurines and brocaded walls a plenty.
The main focus on the ground floor is the statue of the Buddhist god Maitreya but for us it was the multitude of mini Buddhas lining the walls. Skipping levels 2 and 3 to level 4, this is the floor of the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic - the focus of the temple! A bit underwhelming but again the floor was adorned by several statues, brocaded walls and with a number of Buddhist believers praying in earnest silence despite the continual passage of tourists.
A must do."
,,Landmark building and contents,5.0,,Fabulous inside and out. Great in day or night time. Next to Chinatown and on bus routes. Be sure to see it.
,,Well curated Buddhist temple,5.0,,English and Chinese explanations in the temple. Showcases Buddhist faith. The temple is also air conditioned and beside a food market.
,,A peaceful sanctuary,4.0,,"Buddha tooth relic temple is a place of peace and calm... I think when you feel tired or started to questioning the meaning of your life, this is a good place to meditate. Go to the uppermost floor, where they provided space for visitors' meditation. The hall was kept in total silence, so you can have a good self meditation here."
,,CNY prayers,5.0,,i go here to pray and also see the gold tooth relic. the sight is very beautiful and the priests here all chant prayers.
,,Nice place,5.0,,Will provide you a lot a knowledge abt the place.locality is nice.can spend 1-2 hrs.good food joints nearby.will give the feel of local area

,,Beautiful and interesting,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit! This is a beautiful temple! I was astounded by the elaborate decor. Be sure to go up to the garden terrace to see the prayer wheel. Also pretty gardens.
,,A Must For Buddhist,4.0,,"If you are ever in the vicinity of Chinatown, this is a must-see attraction. Not because for the photos but to enjoy a serene garden located on the top floor of the temple. Yes. You heard me right, there is a small garden at the rooftop and it's free. A place for you to meditate and enjoy a little bit of greenery. Not to mention to rest your tired feet!

My suggestion would be to take the lifts all the way to the rooftop, enjoy and rest at the garden before slowly making your way down each floor to appreciate the Buddhist culture in Singapore.

There is a Meditation Area, another floor is dedicated to the history of the temple and lastly at the ground floor is the Prayer Hall.

Exit through the back to enjoy the local Chinatown scene minus the tourists!"
,,Very Unique,4.0,,"A truly amazing temple, which varies considerably from those found in other parts of Asia. From the moment you step in, you already notice (and feel) the difference, (even if it is that you still have your shoes on). At every level, there are a number of sights to behold, from the active chanting in the main hall to the solid gold stupa on the fourth floor. Be prepared for a real taste of Buddhist culture very different to what you may experience elsewhere."
,,Very interesting and worth a visit,4.0,,"Set in Chinatown, this Temple is huge and very ornate.
It has a lovely atmosphere and is decorated in a very elaborate manner. Stunning.

,,Dress appropriately and go to the top,4.0,,"Hadn't planned on going here but came across it - free wifi in a temple as well! Don't be on your phone 24/7 but definitely use it to plan the rest of your day. Interesting and colourful as other reviews have said, just be aware to dress appropriately and be covered, follow the rules and don't touch anything. Museum is pretty interesting but my favourite part was the roof top terrace, so calm and peaceful.. spent about an hour here and then walked round the corner to the maxwell food court which was amazing (went there a few times during my stay) and then went on to the red dot design museum which was also round the corner"
,,A wonderful surprice in China Town,5.0,,"With the eve of the Chinese New year and all the hussle and bustle of the celebrations and preparations, the temple was decorated to welcome the New year.

Visit the orchid garden on the roof with its water feature and peaceful place for contemplation and meditation."
,,Colourful and interesting.,4.0,,"Easy to pop into when you are in Chinatown.Just wander in ,arms must be covered, but they offer a pashmina to borrow. There was a service on when we went and it was lovely to see.Lots of colour and an amazing thing to see."
,,Modern temple with an ancient vibe.,4.0,,This is a modern temple built in a typical Chinese pagoda style it is richly gilded on the inside and humming with activity from monks and visitors alike. For those not familiar with ornate Chinese temples this is a must see. Of particular note are the many Buddha statues and when the monks are performing their prayers you feel really in a different world.
,,Keep and eye on opening times,4.0,,"A busy, mystical place. Closed at certain times unless you are attending worship. Cover your limbs and if not , material available to use. Insence burning and useful English notes by gods to give you historical and interesting facts. Buddha tooth on upper floor."
,,A Must See at the tour embarcation point near Chinatown,5.0,,"One of the most elegant and beautiful temples I've visited anywhere. Only completed around 2008, this temple supposedly houses a tooth of Buddha. It was built to be a showplace and gathering place for Buddhists the world over and it most certainly is. Most of the tours embark from just in front of this fabulous temple, so take a few minutes to enter and enjoy the beauty and serenity."
,,Mystic,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a very different experience.This is not an experience that one would come across very often, There is a very good aura surrounding this place..!..Would be great place to visit in the morning and start off the day..!"

,,Security guard on 4th story was rude today,4.0,,"We were visiting the temple today (15 Jan 2017) at around 1:30pm and wanted to visit the orchid garden at the roof level. We took the lift to the 4th level and the security guard asked my lady friend to put on a sarong.

However, she decided not to go up anymore so I proceeded to put the sarong away. The security guard requested me to fold back the sarong first, which was fine. So I began to fold the sarong back into its original position.

Then the security guard proceeds to criticize me in a condescending matter, saying I'm not folding it the right way and asks me if I've gone through national service. Mind you, I'm a 28 year old American tourist, so I tell him I didn't go through national service because I'm not Singaporean. He continues his criticism, saying that if I were in national service, I would be dead meat (for not properly folding a sarong).

Now, I found this language very condescending and uncalled for, and as a visitor and tourist, was taken aback by such behavior. I did not feel welcomed at all, and left in a sour mood. I hope that management can take measures to address such behavior, or at the very least provide more training to staff to have a more welcoming attitude to guests and mind their words, so as not to offend future visitors."
,,Impressive Temple,5.0,,We visited the temple on a day of service which was amazing to see & listen too the chanting. Lots of people were offering money & fruits to all of the different Buddha's. There are lots of religious items to see& photograph etc. Well worth a visit if you are in the area of China town.
,,Just another temple,2.0,,"Nothing special about this temple. It took us a while to find it and when we finally did, we thought ""oh, is this it?""

It kind of looks like any other temple and it actually looks more like the Chinese restaurant in my hometown in Holland."
,,Temple Visit,5.0,,We went into the Temple and were advised to see the top levels first as they were about to close. We went to the top and walked through areas showing history of the Tooth Relic.

,,Beautiful!,5.0,,This is a beautiful temple. There are a few levels to go throughout and you can really take your time seeing all the beautiful things here. We had a great visit. There are scarfs to cover up if your shoulders or legs are showing. A great way to spend an hour or two in Singapore!
,,Excellent Temple in between China Town,4.0,,"This is situated in the heart of China Town, little aside the din & bustle of the local market. The temple has an awe-inspiring structure & looks awesome in the evenings with the light-up. A must visit for the travelers in China Town at Singapore."

,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Interesting place, good to learn about the number of different Buddhas in existence and so on. Shame it seemed a little commercialized, but hey, they need funds to survive and not unrealistic. Well kept, beautiful temple. Don't take females in that have short skirts or bare shoulders, you will be asked to cover up."
,,A MUST VISIT,4.0,,"Been here several times and thought it was due for a review. The Temple has a great museum on the 3rd floor (I believe it is the 3rd), and a great viewing from the second floor. Best of all air-conditioned and a wonderful place to spend a time quietly."
,,Absolutely amazing!!!,5.0,,This is the best buddha temple I have visited till date. It is around 5 storeys and it is amazing to see so many buddha statues which have been carved to the finest details. Colorful and amazing. This attraction should not be missed

,,Great interior - free entrance,5.0,,"Very nice temple with most wonderful statues, carvings and wall cloths of silk Highly recommendable!"
,,Tranquil Place in the heart of China town,4.0,,"Despite the hustle and bustle, this place is very zen once you enter. Occasionally, there are some monks chanting. The upper level has an open air garden which makes it very comfortable for a good rest from the shopping in Chinatown. You can also get free vegetarian food at the B1 level. Do take note to wear long sleeves or bring along a cardigan, also anything shorter than the knee is not advised. It is afterall a temple."
,,Calm & Peaceful Temple,5.0,,It's a must visit temple in Singapore. Close to Chinatown and can walk from the MRT along the shops. The street also very interesting and it will not be boring walk towards the temple.
,,A must see when in Chinatown!,5.0,,"Beautiful exterior and interior! The attention to detail in the statues and various places inside and outside the temple is amazing. Do head up to the upper levels to take a look as well, its worth your time. Do dress decently as this is a place of worship, avoid spaghetti straps and similar revealing clothing or you will be asked to wear a shawl provided free of charge at the entrance of the temple.

Great place to visit on a hot day, its a short 10 min walk from Chinatown MRT (Take exit F and walk down South Bridge Road), other station exits are fine as well and its a 2-3 minute walk all other major attractions within Chinatown like Sri Mariamman Temple and the various streets and shops as well. There are many eateries nearby too!

Additional info (food): Near the back of the temple there will most likely be street peddlers on those motorbikes with umbrellas selling ice cream, its cheap and good and $1-$2! There's also a stall selling German sausages nearby called Erich's Wuerstelstand, Blk 5 Banda Street- 01-52 stall no 5 K88 Coffee House. 3 mins walk from the temple. Decent German sausages."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This is in the heart of Chinatown, you can sit in the food hall at the Chinatown complex and look across at the temple if you ensure you sit on that side.

The monks chanting sets a great atmosphere and there are 1,000s of little Buddhas. You will need to cover your shoulders but they do provide free shawls which is great. The temple is over 5 floors and is free to access.

Plus they have some actual monks reciting and meditating, and locals praying too! Very authentic feel!"

It is a real place of worship so be respectful. Men and women need to cover their knees and shoulders, but the shawls are provided free of charge.

The reliquary and its surrounds are remarkable and well worth seeing.

The wax replicas of great monks are very life like... I was ponding if one would come to life!

The roof tops garden is also very peaceful.

Strongly recommend a visit!"
,,Neat place,5.0,,"Really neat Buddhist temple in the heart of Chinatown. The lower level consists of two major rooms - the larger one often has prayer services going on with Buddhist monks and other disciples chanting for an eternity. The whole level is filled with thousands of mini buddhas.

The 2nd floor has various Buddhist relics.

The 4th floor has the Buddha tooth - it's a neat display - the tooth sits in a sealed room which you can view - the entire room is made of gold. You can't really see the tooth - it's within part of the gold structure...and you are just too far away, but a neat thing to see. Women need to wear a long skirt in this room - they provide something you can tie on.

The rooftop consists of an outdoor garden, and a large cylindrical prayer wheel

Neat little place filled with some education on the Buddhist religion/culture"

Definitely worth a visit."

It is a modern temple being only 11 years old but is an excellent way to learn a little more about the religion. There are 5 floors to the temple which all have different areas of interest. There are many statues and sculptures with good information detailing each piece. This is a temple where people go to worship so do be mindful when taking your photos. There is a guided tour on a Saturday for 2 hours if you want more information.

The interior of the temple walls are covered in Buddha's, you can walk completely around the ground floor of the temple behind the altar then back to the main entrance, the altar area is restricted, photography is not. There is a counter near the main entrance just in case you want to purchase a religious artefact.

,,Amazing Buddhist temple in the centre of Chinatown,4.0,,"Located right in the heart of Chinatown is this amazing five storey pagoda style Buddhist temple. The temple was busy with devotees and tourists, much like the rest of Chinatown. Surprisingly it is a relatively new temple and was only built in 2007. The main entrance is on South Bridge Road where you walk through three large, heavy, red lacquered doors into a small courtyard, with a bell tower and drum tower on either side. From there you enter in the main hall, which is surrounded by hundreds of small Buddha statues, each with different mudras (hand signs) and holding different Buddhist implements or accessories. Above the Buddha statues are one hundred heavenly dragons, providing protection and vitality to all who worship in the hall. Behind the main hall is the Universal Wisdom hall, dominated by a statue of Buddha seated on a lotus flower, make sure you check out the zodiac protectors on the walls surrounding the hall. The mezzanine floor allows you to view down onto the main hall, though the surrounding walls have life sized waxworks of eminent sanghas.
It is however more than just a temple take the lift up to the fourth floor to view the Buddha tooth relic. It is reportedly the left canine tooth recovered from Buddhas funeral pyre and discovered in the remains of a collapsed stupa in Myanmar (Burma), having visited the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka, I was a bit dubious about its authenticity. The dazzlingly ornate 2.0m high solid gold stupa in which the tooth relic resides is impressive. No photos however are allowed inside the Sacred Light Hall. Then there's the museum on the third floor, with its relic chamber at the rear containing samples of Buddha's skin, blood, hair and large intestine (I kid you not).
Make sure you also visit the serene rooftop garden, far above the madding crowds. In the centre of this oasis is a pagoda housing a huge prayer wheel.
The temple is open from 7am to 7pm and is free. Just make sure that you are respectfully dressed and behaved as this is a place of worship and veneration."
,,Very impressive and beautiful,5.0,,Going to chinatown you will meet the temple. Entrence is free and there are clothes to put on if your wearing is too open.

Even the kids were fusinated and we got lucky seeing the monks playing and preying. Highly recomended.

First floor has 2 large Buddha stairs and many smaller ones on the periphery. The Buddha 'tooth' is on the 4th floor in a solid gold arrangement. Be respectful when visiting, this is a place of worship.

Free rental of sarongs is available at the lower floor (they will not let women enter without covering below the knees). The temple itself is also free entry.

We had the very good fortune to encounter a delightful elderly local man, who guided my sister and I throughout the building. Without him, We might not have seen the amazing rooftop garden and the prayer wheel. He showed us the room with the tooth relic and invited us to feel free to come meditate. Anyone is welcome. The golden Buddha was stunning, as were the assortment of Buddha figures from various countries. You can even find the Buddha that represents your astrological sign. As our guide said, the gods ""are a big family!"" Please be sure to wear knee length shorts and shirts with sleeves- however, they are very happy to provide garments to cover yourself."

The building is fully air conditioned and there are even a foodcourt that served simple and cheap vegetarian food at the basement.

Remember to see and pay your respect to the buddha tooth relic if you are there. If you see the monk at the side on that buddha tooth relic floor, do close up your palms together and pay your respect to him. The monk will bless you will holy water and chanting.

I haven't had the opportunity to visit an active temple and it was just stunning. The colors, decor and gold rival the beauty of the cathedrals of Europe. There are so many intricate details both in the decor and the architecture. There are literally thousands of Buddhas here. There are four levels to explore and a lovely rooftop garden. Hearing the monks chant was really something. Note that there is a dress code, and there are cloth wraps provided if your shoulders or legs are too exposed. They're very polite about it and we had no problems being respectful of their traditions. There are also a couple of rooms were you must remove your shoes. Don't miss this lovely little jewel in Chinatown."

They provide covers for women to wear over shorts so that that bare legs ""don't distract the monks while they're chanting"" as one of my tour guides put it. Great shopping is nearby as is the hawker square for all kinds of amazing food at cheap prices. Definitely a must do to see local culture."

Must go for first time visitors in Singapore (specially for shopping some local stuff)"

,,Absolutely Stunning!,5.0,,"Not big into temples and monuments but recognise they must be seen to take in the atmosphere of the area, how people live etc. I must say, this was one of the most stunning places I have been to for many a year! Everything was in amazing condition and of prime exhibition quality; the attention to detail in the carvings, walls, even the tiles left me amazed. They had a roof garden, there was a meditation area, used by members of the public and the monks, which I was allowed to wander around and absorb the whole feeling of the place and its peace. Good signage and descriptions, and then there was a museum; everything in one place and an absolute joy to visit."

All faiths welcome to visit as long as respect is shown for actual worshippers.

Highly recommended."

The decor and ornaments inside are spectacular. There is good information about the exhibits, the golden surroundings of the actual relic are amazing, and there is no tawdry attempt to part you from your cash. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, you do have to remove your shoes if you want to see the relic, and yes, make sure your legs are covered (they'll give you a kind of sari if not). We spent the best part of an hour inside, and I felt a great deal more relaxed when I left. Go up to the roof to see people using the prayer wheel - it's peaceful and enchanting."

Check the website for what's happening before you turn up.

The museum is on the upper floors with the tooth relic on L4 (be prepared to take off your shoes there) and a peaceful rooftop garden with a large prayer wheel in the middle. The museum has a wonderful selection of Buddhist art and artifacts, and tells the history of Buddhism beautifully.

A dress code is in place, so short shorts, minis and sleeveless will need to be covered up with sarongs or wraps. Speaking softly in keeping with the atmosphere would be nice. No photographs inside the tooth relic shrine, although non flash photography is allowed everywhere else.

Very much worth a visit, highly recommended."

A good outing nonetheless. Ladies must...More"

Many different god in there and the architecture there is amazing with it's details"
,,one place to feel prayers,4.0,,"There is so much of worshipping here, that once can feel tranquility and serenity here. lots of prayers going inside in Buddhist traditional way."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,We were amazed this was a free venue open to the public. Very colorful and full of beautiful carvings/statues. While we were there a monk was performing some type of ceremony with a local woman so that was fun to see. Located in China Town. A nice spot to stop especially on a hot day. They had several floors to view with the top floor for mediation and it houses the tooth relic. Ladies if your legs are not covered they provide sarongs to wear while you are in the temple.
,,Healing,5.0,,"Very good culture experience and informative! nice place to just sit and meditate. Please do dress appropriately, but if you're not, there's always shawls you can use and return at the door of the temple."
,,A piece of culture amid the mayhem,4.0,,"This is a large red temple just to the side of the Chinatown Market area. Inside is incredibly ornate - it's free to enter and you feel welcome whatever your religion. You do need to be modestly dressed - shorts down to knees and shoulders covered but they do offer wraps, if needed. You can get incense sticks, light and place in cauldron. As a lot of other Buddha temples - it just has a lovely, calming feel. Definitely worth visiting."
,,Devine place,5.0,,"Its a state of the art of Chinese culture. The moment I entered to the temple, I realized peace of mind. One must visit this temple. Beautiful temple with chinese culture."
,,Place to be... place to see,5.0,,"A short walk through the China's place... and a big red building in front of me. Buddha temple... and to take time to discover another culture, the hundreds of Buddha's statues... To see and read a part of this religion. Nice for the eyes and for the spirit..."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,If you are in Chinatown you must go. It is very beautiful with many Buda's on display giving you the names and meanings.
,,Great temple,5.0,,Very nice temple full of interesting information. Worth visiting and spending time roaming around the different sections of the temple / museum. The best Buddhist temple in Singapore by far.
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,"We made a brief stop here while walking through Chinatown, and took some lovely photos. There is no fee for entry but we made a donation.
As we were only here for a short amount of time, I didn't go in. The dress I was wearing (long-sleeved and knee-length, which had been acceptable at other religious sites I visited that day) was deemed too short. Since much of the inside of the building appeared to be dedicated to selling souvenirs (e.g. balloons, toys) I didn't bother to cover up and go in."
,,A must visit not only for its relic!,5.0,,"This Buddhist Temple is also a museum and as such, you will definitely learn more interesting facts about Buddhism overall, whether it's about which ""Guardian Deity"" is linked to the animal of your Chinese year of birth; or whether finding about the differences between a reading pitaka vs a turning pitaka; there are definitely a few facts to learn about.
Make sure you visit the entire temple from the basement to the roof garden, if on a tight schedule do: The main hall on the ground floor, the 4th floor for the golden tooth relic and the rooftop garden to turn the largest prayer wheel in the world."
,,Really peaceful place to visit,4.0,,"This is a modern type temple right in the heart of Chinatown. Beautiful, peaceful and serene inside and several floors to visit and read about the history of the temple. Really excellent condition, free admission and well worth a visit"
,,Blessed,4.0,,"Whether you are a Buddhist or not, this temple is worth the visit. For Buddhists, it may make your faith stronger after seeing the Buddha's relic, his tooth. Makes you believe more that the Buddha was a real human like you and I. Proof.
There is a lot of gold at this temple. And you will be in awe seeing all the statues and artifects on display.
It's also airconditioned and very comfortable on a hot afternoon sunny Sungapore day.
Pay your respects, make a donation, or simply take photos of this beautiful temple.
Worth a visit.
Plus you get Chinatown to walkabout before or after."
,,Wow simply amazing,5.0,,Really enjoyed seeing the Buddha tooth Relic Museum it's wonderful! If you want to learn about the different Buddha's and Chinese culture definitely spend time here it's free so you can check out and take pictures.
,,Peaceful and serene,5.0,,"We had wandered through Chinatown in the heat of the day and came out the other end of a long series of stalls to find the Temple on our right - I had meant to visit it that day but would have completely forgotten if we had not chanced upon it. It was a cool relief from the humidity and having not been to anything remotely similar we found it interesting and informative. Very peaceful and serene, particularly the room where the actual tooth relic is housed in a glassed off area all gold plated. People were meditating around the periphery of the room and like the other visitors we maintained a respectful hush. Very glad to have seen this on our stay, to balance up the capitalism and modernity of the city."
,,Nice,5.0,,"We visited this place is first time. Here is nice place to u come and pray about lucky in your life. I wrote my name on a coins , then i prayed and put in a box here. So interesting 😝"
,,RESPECT THIS AMAZING TRIBUTE TO BUDDHA,5.0,,"Walking into what I thought was just another temple was a big mistake.
This temple was one of the finest that I have seen in my travels around the
world.Built at the edge of Chinatown this temple is a real credit to the Buddhist
people & shows how much this means to them.Beautifully set out with wonderful
statues & prayer offerings culminating in the ""tooth relic ""display on the 4th floor.
Another must see for all people who have religious tolerance."
,,A spiritual experience,5.0,,"If you are at all spiritual or inquisitive make sure you visit the Buddhah Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. This is a lovely peaceful and spiritual experience. If you are lucky you will also be able to listen to the monk do their chanting, which may sound strange to start with but if you close your eyes and let it envelope you, it will be very soothing and comforting. This is an amazing place to visit. It is easily accessed by taxi or the MRT."
,,Temple - A Must Visit Place of Worship,4.0,,"This temple is located in a very convenient location at the heart of Chinatown area. Nearby hawker centres (Chinatown market, Maxwell market) with some nice local dishes to try at reasonable prices. Everyday, there's a place behind the temple where people gather to play Chess.

The temple has many levels, Basement - where vegetarian food are served, First level - One could pray to their guardians, please prefer to Chinese horoscopes signage before you pray, Second and Third level - More in depth to Buddhism. Before temple was built, some people even donated their gold as offerings.

Temple staff will advise you to loan their scarves FOC, in case you are in shorts or plunging necklines."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,"I last came here around 8 years ago and it still has that awe about it.

A full Buddhist prayer session was taking place when I arrived which made the visit even more amazing. Fortunately, the temple was still open to the public and it was an enjoyable experience to witness this.

Definitely worth a visit if you are nearby Chinatown."
,,Surprisingly Good,4.0,,I'm a foreigner from the West. I went here with my Chinese Buddhist in-laws and was very surprised. There is always prayer and chanting happening in the main chamber of the temple. They have a huge amount of relics and art of the Buddha from different cultures: lots of opportunity to learn. There is a secret garden with a prayer drum on the top of the roof. The family have been Buddhists all their lives and they very much enjoyed the visit.
,,The place of worship,4.0,,"The grand art of the temple. Made of gold. Peaceful and calm. If you come at the right time. (Jan or before Feb,where the locals are celebrating Chinese New year. ). The temple will also lit up in the night. The view is great. No matter what time you reach. It will be peaceful. There's also 2 hawker Aka food centre nearby the temple. Try the local food."
,,Good place to learn more about Buddhism,4.0,,"To me, it was not only a temple, but a fantastic museum where I could learn a lot more about Buddhism, its long history. The temple was located in the heart of Chinatown, about 10 minutes from Chinatown MRT and 15 minutes from Tanjong Pagar MRT."
,,interesting,4.0,,"this is a great building to see the chinese culture. they all pray for luck. in our eyes it seems like superstition, but it is very interesting to see how they worship and the sculptures are really beautiful."
,,An amazing place,5.0,,"It would be a great shame to visit Sngapore, and not go to visit this Temple. It is stunningly beautiful. A place of peacefulness despite all the tourists."
,,Very impressive inside,4.0,,"Quite ornate with lots of pottery, carvings, etc. On the edge of china town so very accessible. No charge to venture through and worth a visit."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,Great architecture and must visit location if visiting the Chinatown area of Singapore. We enjoyed the experience.
,,just ok.,3.0,,it is just ok.nothing amazing.it worths to go eat at food courts next to temple.cheap and good food.also it is clean .
,,How Many Teeth Did the Buddha Have?,3.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a large Buddhist temple on the corner of Sago Street and South Bridge Road in Singapore's Chinatown.

It is a large and ornate temple that is in daily use by local Buddhists, so if you visit please dress conservatively and be respectful.

This temple's main claim to fame is that it houses a tooth of the Lord Buddha. I mean no disrespect, but the normal adult human has 32 teeth and around the world there are hundreds of Buddhist temples that lay claim to one of those 32 teeth.

One thing that did surprise me here, as I live in Thailand and am used to visiting Buddhist temples, is that nobody, including the Buddhist monks, took off their shoes."
,,Let me entartain you,4.0,,"An unexpected nice stop in our visit through Chinatown. There was some sort of ceremony, with a lot of singing, going on while we visited which was really nice. The sculptures inside are also really well made"
,,Unexpectedly a great sidetrip,5.0,,"After eating at Chinatown food complex, this temple is a must-go for every tourist. Inside, one is able to see gold shimmering all around the place. Also, you will be inspired by the beautiful deities in the temple. You'll have fun reading the descriptions. Definitely one of the best, underrated tourist attraction in Singapore."
,,Very impressive,4.0,,One of the nicest buddistic temples I have ever been and it is so close to the city centre and the financial district. Worth a visit.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,Very Peaceful place. Very clean temple. Lovely places to eat surrounding it. You don't need a long time here maximum 20 mins
,,Rainy morning trip,4.0,,Didn't know what to expect but was amazed once inside peaceful and relaxing no charge donations only and must take shoes off certain room
,,Nirvana,5.0,,"Being a Buddhist enthusiast, this was on my to-do list in Singapore and it did not disappoint. In stark contrast to the chaotic China Town, the temple was a place of peace, awe and sanctity. As soon as you step inside you are transported to another dimension, the bright red/orange lights and shining gold carved statues make for a beautiful ambiance.

It has multiple floors and if you have time on your hands you should definitely check them all out.

Photography is permitted inside without flash."
,,Great Temple to Inspire,5.0,,Loved the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple what an awe inspiring place to spend a little time and reflect on the busy lives we lead.
,,Chance rainy day jewel,5.0,,"Visited on a rainy morning as it's indoors. So happy that we did. Beautiful beautiful temple and so nice to be in somewhere with complete peace and tranquillity. You can take pictures everywhere except the 4th floor, which is where the tooth is displayed. No bare shoulders or mini skirts for the ladies and no shorts for the gents."
,,"An unexpected, amazing highlight",5.0,,"We didn't know much about the temple prior to our visit. When we entered, a kindly gentleman advised us to inspect the temple further.....and we are so glad we did. We saw the spectacular room where the Buddha Tooth relic is held.....then we visited the tranquil rooftop garden which holds the world's largest prayer wheel.
This temple is a must-visit when in Singapore."
,,Awesome temple,5.0,,Nearly walked straight past it but decided to have a look at the last minute. So glad we did as it was simply one of the best temples we had seen in Singapore. Do not miss you will regret it if you do
,,A place of peace,5.0,,"A beautiful temple with hints of modern touches! The bottom floor has some fascinating buddha statues and beautifully decorated walls. The interior is stunning, and if you take the lift upstairs, there's a museum of artifacts, the buddha tooth itself (in a special room filled with gold!) where you must remove your shoes, and the top floor has a peaceful garden with a prayer wheel. Definitely recommend visiting the rooftop garden, not many people visit this area so it's very peaceful. Highlights include the pagoda surrounded by water features and plants, and the hundreds of buddha figures placed in the walls."
,,Beautiful piece of Culture,5.0,,The temple is extraordinary in the architecture and the decor on the inside is just breath taking. a place to observe the day to day çulture of many people who live and visit Singapore.
,,Fantastic Temple,4.0,,"A fairly new but stunning temple in china town, lovely architecture. When we were there a ceremony was just starting and a kind local advised us not to use the central door when entering."
,,Religious in the middle of China Town,4.0,,"If you like temples or want to go in for a quick look at the buddhas, this is a very nice and religious place. Very impressive to see so many small buddha figures. Is located in the middle of china town very close to the subway exit. Very nice area to visit and very good place."
,,A multifunctional modern temple in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"The temple was only completed in 2007. As it is close to the CBD, the land is precious so the architecture has four storeys with a rooftop garden. The main halls are on the 1st floor, the hall of fame for the abbots of Southeast Asia on the mezz floor, the art display on the 2nd floor, the history of Buddha on the 3rd and the tooth relic on the 4th. The temple has pretty much everything for everyone with a modern twist well balanced with the tradition."
,,Must see when in Chinatown,4.0,,It's in the Chinatown area of Singapore. The temple is very big. You have 5 floors to explore. I love the fact that it's is still a working temple. When we got there people & monks were praying. It doesn't stop people from taking photos. The only other place I have seen with so much gold is the Vatican. It's quiet opulent but really interesting. I wish I have known there are free tours of the temple as I would have liked to take one to find out more about this place. Unfortunately that's not something they advertise well.
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,Visited the Buddha Tooth relic temple during my recent visit to Singapore. Once you step into the forecourt of the temple you feel immersed in Chinese culture and you need quite some time to absorb all the visual stimuli from the ornate interior.
,,Beautiful and serene,5.0,,"This is an impressive temple located in Chinatown. If you aren't properly dressed (shoulders and knees covered), there are garments to the right of the entrance that you can wear. When we went, there were many monks chanting and praying, as well as a lot of devotees. Even if you have already seen a lot of Buddhist temples, this one is worth visiting. It's the most impressive site in the area."
,,Great place to learn about buddhism,4.0,,A great place to visit if you're interested in buddhism. The entrance is free. There are 5 floors ish with galleries where materials on the history of buddhism are exposed. The architecture is just incredible. Don't forget to visit the garden on the rooftop ;)
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Very interesting museum upstairs, don't just visit the ground floor! Lots of Buddhist history and explanations and a nice roof garden. We spent over an hour here and it was time well spent."
,,Impressive. All floors should be explored,4.0,,"There is a lot to see at the Temple as it is spread over many floors.

A service was in progress on the ground floor and food gifts had been left outside. On higher floors there is a rooftop tranquil area with wishing bell, as well as the relic. A privilege to be able to observe the worshippers and visit the Temple."
,,Don't miss this if you are in Chinatown,5.0,,A place to pray and meditate and appreciate chinese architecture. Make sure that you will not miss this landamark whenever you go in Chinatown. It's really a gem in Chinatown Singapore.
,,Lovely temple,4.0,,Impressed by this temple despite i have saw already many of them in Asia. Thousands small Budhas inside all different decorate the walls and then in the center of the temple the beautiful big Budha!
,,Pleasant,4.0,,Very nice place. We went like tourists so not for praying. It's very beautiful and peaceful if you like to meditate or pray. Also can buy the lucky charms from this temple.
,,stunning,4.0,,"A new temple, only 10 years old I believe, worth having a look around if you are in China town. Remember not to go through the middle door"
,,Peaceful Rooftop Garden,5.0,,"I really liked my visit to this temple. You can mediate in the main floor of the temple. They even let you borrow clean blankets, should you desire one to mediate. The temple itself is gorgeous! Take the steps to the roof top garden, this is where I felt more comfortable meditating, surrounded by all the plants. The main attraction here is the prayer wheel. If you walk clockwise three times with the wheel and pray, with the three chime, all your prayers are answered! Or so the legend goes, I gave it a try! :)"
,,A must see when visiting Singapore's Chinatown,4.0,,My son and I had an enjoyable tour of this temple and its history. There is no admission but donations are accepted. Access is granted for all the floors. You definitely want to give yourself 2-3 hours to tour this temple. Good walking shoes and a camera are needed too. This is great for a family and if the weather outside is too hot or rainy.
,,"Great Architecture, Nicely Preserved",5.0,,Nice place in Chinatown. Can see it all in just a few minutes. Attendant will not permit short shorts. Free.
,,Beautiful both inside and out!,5.0,,"Buddha's tooth relic and many other relics here. A temple of 4 levels, a beautiful seating place to meditate also."
,,Beautiful in its double standard,2.0,,"After a multitude of small shrines scattered across Southeast Asia, it was a great experience to once again gaze upon a giant and magnificent temple such as this one; the likes of which we had not seen since Hong Kong. We entered from the Chinatown side, and enjoyed the first room as the miniature statue and tablet museum. Upon exiting this room, an official asked my partner (wearing elbow length sleeves and a knee length skirt) to cover her arms, passing her a shawl; yet he said the test of our attire was inoffensive and therefore apparently unlikely to cause any of the monks inside the temple to become enraged with desire, which would of course have been our fault.

The second room, with its thousands of miniature Buddha statues, was actually slightly underwhelming. Compared to similar temples in Hong Kong, this one seemed slightly artificial especially given that every statue was identical. The signposting stopped entirely after the first museum room, but the two shrine rooms were still rather beautiful to look at even if no information was given.

That was, however, until we reached the end of the main shrine and another official approached us. Apparently, my partner's knee length skirt was too racy for the inanimate Buddha statue, and we were asked to leave - no offering of shawl given on this end. As we thought we had reached the end, we did not complain. Now that I have checked out the other TripAdvisor reviews and heard that there is a whole extra floor, we are naturally disappointed."
,,hours spent worth it,5.0,,We spend nearly three hours in this Temple. It really is historic and enriching one's knowledge about Buddha and Buddhism. Donations are welcome but it is free for public.
,,Faith in Evidence,5.0,,Visiting this Temple is particularly interesting near Chinese New Year where the devout are keen to seek propitious omens for the coming new year. It is very busy at that time and the devotees and officials don't mind the accompanying invasion of tourists as long as they are respectful and don't interfere or get in the way of some of the more arcane rituals. Colourful and heady with the aroma and smoke of incense this is miles away from the popular image of Singapore as a haven for shoppers and economic growth.
,,outstanding,4.0,,"This is a must the architectural which went into this temple is unbelievable all well organized ideal gentle stroll through all the floors, the contents too much to mention go take look yourselves"
,,The Best Part of Chinatown,5.0,,"I visited Singapore on business in June 2016. My wife, son and daughter joined me. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is the best part of Chinatown. On the ground floor are buddha statues and many religious artifacts. Then you take the elevator up to the museum. The first stop is a place where you can meditate. Then different relics and cultural pieces. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum used to have a very large store with a tea place, souvenirs and books but they have closed it. If you can see only one thing in Chinatown I would make it this."
,,An Opulent Temple,4.0,,Awesome! This temple is huge. Taking photo inside the temple is not prohibited. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"I've actually been here a couple of times. It's quite interesting to wander around looking at all the statues and is a great attraction if you are a tourist in Singapore. This is actually a working temple, meaning people do come here to pray so be aware of that and be considerate. What's more is it is totally free but you can give a donation in the various donation boxes. This goes towards the upkeep of the temple."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"Despite living in Singapore for 12 years, we seem to have missed this gem..tranquil and serene, it's a must visit. We spent 3 hours and could have stayed longer..."
,,WOW WOW WOW Emotional Experience,5.0,,"Visiting this Temple was on the top of our list and we were not disappointed.
when we arrived the monks were already chanting and a large group were in the service.
We spent at least 2 hours looking watching listening feeling honoured to be there.
robes are available to cover your arms or legs.
i will never forget this temple"
,,Interesting interior decoration,5.0,,"I went inside the temple. That was my first time to visit a temple. An interesting one. You can see several Buddha statues and some other details typical of a temple. However, you can't take a pic."
,,Great Temple,5.0,,"Don't miss this Temple. Its on the edge of China Town, and I'm sure you will be going there for some shopping. The temple is absolutely beautiful. Pay your respects, you wont be disapointed!"
,,Serene,4.0,,Chek timings online for the prayers etc and then go there to see and enjoy the prayers in the evening and the tooth relic. Elaborate designs and wood work inside the temple
,,Absolutely Stunning,5.0,,"When you drive past this place you simply cannot look away. Bright, clean, stunning and beautiful. If you're in Singapore, you can't leave without checking out this amazing temple that houses Buddha's tooth."
,,Worth a walk through,5.0,,This is a beautiful operating temple close to the bus stop and a must see when going through Chinatown. For women you must cover your shoulders and arms to walk through so bring a sweater/jacket. It's a quick visit and gives a good sense of history for the area.
,,Really impressive and mystic place,5.0,,Obligatory visit to your Chinatown tour Singapur. It is really a mystic place. We had the luck to assist to a ceremony and it was very spiritual.
,,Impressive Buddhist Temple,5.0,,This is a very nice place to visit. The temple is glittering inside. Don't forget to go to the top rooms and roof garden.
,,No photo,4.0,,"This is a fully functioning temple and they don't mess about, so make sure you don't either. I can't say this was the most spiritual experience, it all felt quite tensed."
,,Worth a visit if in the area,4.0,,"Much of the old Chinatown has been lost to development or has become 'theme parked' - pretty temple, worth the visit if in the area."
,,Add This To Your Chinatown tour,4.0,,Easy to get to from all areas. Be sure to dress appropriately to not offend. Could be busy and ceremonies could be occurring to add to your interest.
,,I'll remember this experience forever,5.0,,"This was the first attraction I stopped at when I got to Singapore. The outside is pretty but when you step inside, it's gorgeous. So much to see and take in, I've never experienced anything like it before - or since!

Make sure you read the website to make sure you're dressed properly. Women have to have their arms covered and they provide scarves (no cost to you) to do this but I don't think some dresses are acceptable. There was a prayer service going on when I arrived in the middle of the room but the outside was open for you to walk around quietly. The room is surrounded with 100 different Buddhas along the wall, each one so ornate and pretty.

One of the upper levels required you to take off your shoes before entering and you had to be silent in the room. Something to keep in mind if you have little children with you. The top level was a garden and had a prayer wheel where you walk around it and spin it. Again, nothing I ever experienced before and I loved every aspect of this Temple.

I took so many photos that it was hard for me to select just a few for this review, so I uploaded a bunch. :)

Without question, visit this place. You'll be disappointed if you leave Singapore and don't see it."
,,Beautiful experience!,5.0,,"I could have stayed here for hours. Well, I actually did! But I could have stayed even longer. Witnessing the actual praying by the monks was so cool! I loved the walls of ten thousand Buddhas, the tooth relic chamber upstairs where you can meditate, the prayer wheel on the roof, and then the extensive museum dedicated to Buddha with many artifacts and statues."
,,Amazing tample,4.0,,This temple is quite beautiful and interesting when seen from the outside . the inside of the buildings is also quite beautiful combined with the living room where many sculpture small statue is beautiful and interesting . This temple is also quite easy to reach by public transport is convenient
,,Magnificent and elegant temple.,5.0,,"One of the first temples where we've been to where they were conducting a service, complete with music, singing, monks and a large congregation. My husband loves visiting temples, I however don't. We have visited many temples around the world, some in Japan I was very impressed with but this one is superb. It has several levels each unique. I've never seen such elaborate Buddhas and Dharma protectors. We didn't visit some of the floors but what we saw was very elegant and beautiful. Worth a visit."
,,interesting place to visit fo,4.0,,"The best place to understand Buddhist history, the temple have huge number of item that is very interesting to the person who like the Art and history.
The temple is peaceful and don't worry you cannot understand what is the item inside, every item had the clean explanation by English and mandarin."
,,Stunning - must-visit.,5.0,,"Very ornate, beautiful, working temple. A must-visit. Located just on the edge of Chinatown so makes a lovely day out."
,,Serious Interesting,4.0,,I didn't know what to expect from its name. It was immaculately decorated and spotlessly clean. I was fascinated by the '100 Buddha's as well as all the other main shrine objects. Well worth a visit and only a short walk from Chinatown.
,,Great spot for photos,4.0,,"Only checked this out from the outside as we were very short on time, but would recommend. It is only about 50m down the road from the Indian temple which is also interesting from the outside. A good spot to take some pics."
,,Good point to stop by if in the area,4.0,,"It is small so the visit is quick. Very much for locals' use feeling. It doesn't feel like a tourist trap even when there are many ways for believers to make a donation.

In the area surrounding it there are many souvenirs shops, including ones you can try durian fruit..."
,,Impressive and beautiful,4.0,,"This temple can get a little crowded but nothing too bad. It really is beautiful, golden everywhere and so many Buddhas. Don't forget to go upstairs have a look at the exhibitions and, of course, the tooth."
,,Nice visit on rainy July day,5.0,,"Visited this Temple in late July and what a beautiful Temple. The colours are rich and vibrant and the space is quite large. I felt kind of strange taking photos as there were many people worshipping, but the results were quite please. Highly recommended if you find yourself in the Chinatoen area of Singapore."
,,Noon visit,3.0,,"During the month of August or lunar seventh month which is ghost month celebrated by the local Chinese. The temple will organise the player for the decease. You can see the monks and followers chanting in grand setting.
You are allowed to go into the temple to observe the occasion and the many Buddhas displays. Observe the rules of the temple in terms of dressing."
,,Temple located in Chinatown,3.0,,This is a relatively new temple and located at a busy junction in Chinatown. I personally find this temple not representative of the traditional temples seen in Singapore. There are many older ones around Singapore which I prefer.
,,"Nothing to see here, unless you're Buddhist.",2.0,,"Basically this is a Buddhist temple. Not one of those with historical significance, but one built just several years ago. If you're interested in places of worship with historical significance, there are other better temples to visit in Singapore."
,,Huge and different.,4.0,,"A fairly recent building of four floors and a roof-top garden.
We arrived during a service in the elaborate ground-floor temple which was interesting. On the 4th is the temple to the Buddha'stooth relic which is also colourfully exotic. On the intervening two floors are multiple Buddhist relics which would, no doubt, be of interest to students of Buddhism, but less so to the general public."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,We wandered through and were surprised by its serenity. It is very large and (on our day) was very busy. Very welcoming and open to 'just looking'.
,,Very interesting to see inside,4.0,,There was a ceremony when we were there. Nice to see how they do. Very beautiful inside. Insightful. Wish I had more time to read the different buddhas. Will visit again if given a chance.
,,Steer clear of their bookshop!,3.0,,"They sell books here at 5x of the marked price! No kidding. Yes, I understand, that the place has to generate profit for daily operations and lots of other things. But I am still uneasy about pricing policy.
IIis a beatiful place indeed, but do not buy anything here, a voluntary donation is better."
,,Beautiful yet divided,4.0,,"It is always strange when an active place of worship is also a tourist attraction, but that is just what this temple is. There are always people praying, and if you're lucky, you may even walk in when a service is about to start.

The temple obviously embraces its more commercial side, and there is also a museum that you can visit upstairs. That one isn't for free though.

The free areas are already a rare sight in themselves, as this is a truly beautiful temple, very much worth the visit. I just personally find it a little strange to wander about taking pictures while others are exercising their spirituality."
,,free museum about buddhism,5.0,,"The temple on the ground floor is so beautiful. Defenetly worth the visit. There is a rooftop temple, a museum about buddhism and the life of buddha, a display of how they made the temple and you can have a look at the inner temple from above. Off course you get to see the relic tooth in a golden stuppa."
,,Best place to visit in singapore,5.0,,"One of the more cultural things to do in Singapore. Even with people trapesing through the temple taking pictures, it was a peaceful and tranquil place due to the prayers and meditation by the monks. Really interesting to learn about buddhism."
,,Great potential but still free,3.0,,"The temple is about 10 minute walk from China town MRT (if you don't get distracted along the way by all the amazing buildings and Chinese eateries).

The temple is huge in size and very golden a pristine inside. It was unfortunate that the tours only ran on a Saturday though and I could only access grand floor on a Sunday. Make sure you plan around this - tours are 2 hours long and only run twice on a Saturday."
,,Wasnt expected too many buddha,5.0,,Visited last July during my SG trip. They provide long cloth to cover your legs or arms if you are wearing skirts and sleeveless. These are for free! Entrance is free. I never expected that one wall of the temple will be covered with little buddha. It is located in the chinatown. A must see temple in SG.
,,Buddist Temple and learning centre,3.0,,Very nice Temple. Well worth a visit to see a working learning centre in full swing. Lots of students reading and chanting. Was very nice to see. Both inside and out the temple is very impressive.
,,Nice temple in the city,4.0,,"A temple with lotta stuff in there for one to see and learn. within the temple, it was very peaceful and quiet."
,,Nice to visit with Buddhism,4.0,,The building is really outstanding in China Town. You may see the many Buddhism in the museum. Try to explore at root top garden.
,,A great place to learn about Buddhism,4.0,,"A must stop in this side of Singapore, this temple offers great views from the outside (very nice facade), as well as historical relics and interesting interior."
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,"Most locals know this temple well. But it is slightly more difficult to find for tourists - especially since currently there is a lot of construction going on. The temple is completely free to visit and all floors are open - the rooftop is a must for peace and beauty. I wish people were more respectful of the customs and a bit quieter to enjoy this, however for the most part the many people visiting are polite and courteous. Certainly a beautiful nod to Singapore's important Chinese past and in an easy to reach spot in China town. If you're hungry afterwards, the only Michelin stared chicken rice in the world is 30 seconds away in the nearby China Town hawker centre."
,,"Air-conditioned, modern take on a traditional Chinese temple",4.0,,"Located at a short 10 min walk from Chinatown MRT station, the Buddha tooth relic temple is an interesting site to visit, albeit eccentric. The temple is retains much of it's Chinese origins in it's architecture and decor, but deviates from the norm in that they do not allow the burning of candles, incense, and joss paper as offerings. Instead, the temple is air-conditioned and encases much of their statues and ornaments. Avoid going to the temple after 8pm (although you might still be able observe the prayer sessions if the security lets you pass) as that is when the Buddhist devotees will conduct their prayer.

Free books printed by the temple are available on the right of the inner entrance of the temple; covering everything from Buddhist sutras, to the Origin stories of Buddhism."
,,Lux,4.0,,"I love this place... I don't know why, but i feel luxurious when i'm inside the temple :D. Just love it."
,,Beautiful Temple in the Heart of Chinatown,4.0,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is just a few steps away from Chinatown MRT Station. There are a lot of beautiful sculptures inside with several bones of the Buddha display.
,,Well furnished temple,5.0,,"Very peaceful upon entering the temple. It is also very nicely furnished, and we are able to climb to the upper level to view the scenery around Chinatown. A peaceful and holy place in the middle of a noisy surrounding."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"If you are into immersing yourself into other cultures, then this is a must spot for you to visit. This was my first contact with Buddhist type building. Without going into the spiritual, the temple is quite big, but more importantly it is mixture of serene and breathtaking. Coming from the busy Chinatown street market it will feel like you suddenly stepped into a different time and dimension."
,,"If you like temples then visit, else skip",3.0,,While this will be part of your city tour it can be skipped. Spend more time in the shopping markets opposite. The best deals for souvenirs can be obtained there. I am saying this after checking in multiple shops and places.
,,Peace,5.0,,Visited this temple with my wife earlier this week. The temple is very peaceful and you get caught in the tranquility of the place
,,A bit fake but still worth it.......,4.0,,"This was a target of mine in Chinatown and it was a slight disappointment in some ways - it did not feel authentic but was still well done.

Good points
1. Free and easy to find on Pagoda Street
2. A used and living temple - please be respectful
3. Many floors with different things to see including the room housing the tooth of the Buddha, a roof garden and a museum

Overall, interesting and worth a visit and the roof garden is a nice free oasis in the middle of Chinatown for a quiet break if you need one."

,,Go in and explore all 5 levels!,5.0,,"There are brown sarongs at entrance for visitors to pop on if shoulders and legs are exposed. We quietly walked inside and around ground level whilst a Buddhist service was happening. We then took the lift and stopped and explored each level. There is a museum on one level. On another is an extremely ornate gold room (no photography allowed) where Buddhists were quietly praying - this is the actual Buddha Tooth Relic. What a room! Gold everywhere! Be sure to keep exploring all the floors - including the orchid rooftop garden and prayer wheel.

,,Temple in China Town,3.0,,Remember you will need to be appropriately dressed to visit this temple.

It is devoted to the Future Buddha and shows the Buddhas for each of the signs of the Chinese zodiac as well as hundreds of smaller Buddhas.
Be sure to dress appropriately though - no sleeveless tops, shorts or short skirts.
It is easy to get to from the Chinatown MRT stop."
,,Calm and relaxing,4.0,,"If you were near Chinatown, this is a place that you should visit. It's very relaxing visiting all levels in the temple. You may see the history of the building, the information and knowledge of the religion and different buddha statue. It's indoor with air conditional.

,,Curiosity of Its Architectural Took Me There,4.0,,"This is a working temple; daily activities of praying and chanting was seen. You could still walk through to look inside.Although it didn't say no pictures is allowed but out of respect i didn't take any pictures.

The building itself was relative new and yes it was quite imposing; I like it. There are lots of eatery about after your visit, which is a plus.

Now this is a functioning buddhist temple and we got lucky to see a ceremony of sorts. But if you are a female you must cover your legs and shoulders which I gladly did. They offer shawls and a wrap around skirt of sorts at the front door. My daughter who was in a tank top did not need to cover up due to her young age. This temple is beautiful and amazing and mystical... mystical you ask, yes it supposedly houses the Tooth relic which is believed to ward off evil. You can just feel the energy in the air.... so beautiful"

The history and examples of Buddhism are amazing. Although some prior reviews stated how peaceful it was, I did not find it to be so. The visitors were noisy on my visit and it was a bit crowded. I would recommend this to any and all as a great place to spend a few hours."

The Veneration plates (with fruits, garlands, flowers, sticks, etc.) were displayed in an orderly manner outside the temple.

If you visit china-town then this is a must visit attraction, especially peace seekers."
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"This was a unique experience which I enjoyed very much, but didn't rate as high as I might have if there had been signage to help me understand better what I was seeing. I am not very familiar with this religion and would have liked to have had a better understanding of what I was seeing. But it was all very beautiful, colorful and unique."

,,A Must-Stop when visiting Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,"If you're not familiar with Chinese temples, this well-known landmark in Chinatown is worth a visit. Even if you're familiar with Chinese temples, I'd still recommend a visit.... after you browse through the lower floors, head up to the 7th storey. The roof-top garden is a well kept secret (well, not so secret anymore!), and is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of touristy Chinatown. Pretty potted plants (some beautiful orchids) dot around the garden path, and you can take the time to sit in the shade of the roofed corridors, or visit the giant bell in the bell tower. This is a nice, idyllic stop."
,,Very intersting,5.0,,"Nice athmosphere. Friendly people. Bigger than you think. Also recommended for ""beginners"". The tooth Relic is only available at certain times."
,,A site to get your tooth into!,5.0,,There was a worship going on when we swung by for a visit. If your in Chinatown don't miss this cultural opportunity.
,,Free Admission,5.0,,"The outside of this active Buddha Temple combined with museum appears of a Chinese pagoda that sits in the heart of Singapore Chinatown. FREE admission!!

This temple incorporates elements of Chinese Tang Dynasty of facade structures as the roof for Chinese red is spilled in a modern structure. In the shadow of the setting sun, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum depicts very Chinese presence of Buddhist Mandala. Eminent Sangha Museum feature life stories of monks in Singapore showcasing Buddhist arts and culture. Morning chantings promptly begins at 5AM daily and resident monks adhere a strict vegetarian food diet. It immerses one deep into the Buddhism life and culture for a better understanding.

I distinctly remember from my 2010 visit... Non-flash photography is permitted in the Buddhist Culture Museum and Eminent Sangha Museum. Note: Photography or filming of any device (including mobile phones) is strictly prohibited in the sacred relic chamber. Visitors are to abide in dressing modestly and avoid obscene appearance (gentlemen pickup your pants to the waist line at the entrance!! and ladies no very low cut tops or mini skirts please.) Tranquility is important with respect to the temple and its mission where visitors who are not Buddhist, nor religious in any shape or form, are able to attain inner solace for a moment's peace from today's brutal ever-changing world. Inscriptions are written in English and traditional Chinese. I like this temple for its beautiful open-air garden atrium.

Tourist trap indeed, but worth a visit for the foreigner with an open mind."
,,Nice in the evenings,4.0,,"Free to wander in out as you please, and very interesting to see a relatively modern temple and the monks conducting their daily rituals.

As with all Buddhist temples, legs and shoulders should be covered...wraps and sarongs are provided in the entrance areas."

,,Interesting temple and good food in the neighborhood,4.0,,"The temple is clean and pleasant. It exudes a sense of peace.
The neighborhood is also worth exploring. Opposite the temple is a famous food centre/hawker centre. There are two famous chicken rice stalls, probably the best in Singapore. You can't miss it because the queue for the chicken rice is very long. Buy a whole chicken and enjoy it with the flavorful rice."
,,Glorious Buddhist Kitch,4.0,,"Not your minimalist Buddhist temple but really worth a visit. Make sure you do all the floors, if you have time. The ground floor is beautiful, the museum and the tooth relic hall is really worth a visit. Also - don't miss the roof top garden, it's blissful."

Lots of things to see, especially if you are in the Buddist Temple first time in your life."
,,Amazing site,5.0,,"Colourful and cultural. Visit early to get a real feel for the place before it gets too busy. Also try to catch the monks during one of the chanting sessions, spine tingling. Very interesting artefacts and pieces over five floors. Open to all public but make sure you respect the prayer times and dress code, no short shorts (below the knee ok) and women must cover bare shoulders. Go right up to the top and visit the roof garden, very tranquil. all free but please leave an offering and if you like (we did) say a prayer to the relic...you never know!"
,,Beautifully crafted temple.,5.0,,"After passing through the disappointment of the Sri Mariamman Temple, this is a booster to the day trip. The two are like night and day apart in terms of cleanliness and maintenance.

The soothing bhuddist chants added with the calming atmosphere makes it a must visit place in ChinaTown."
,,Well worth a visit......,4.0,,"in the midst of Chinatown is the temple which gas free entrance. Neither Mrs Vicar or I are culture vultures but it's very interesting to see the philosophies from other parts of the world.

There was a service taking place downstairs, very noisy as it was amplified. Photos are allowed everywhere except at the top floor where the gold dragon tooth is kept surrounded by various meditation areas. Visitors must have their shoulders covered and shorts should reach below the knee but large scarfs and sarongs are provided for free at the entrance so this isn't a problem.

There are a number of rooms and floors, most if the walls are covered in little Buddhas.

Even if you only spend 10 to 15 minutes there it's well worth it."
,,Big temple,4.0,,NoT so much understand about buddhist but we like the ambience there. Staff are nice and kind. My aunts love meditating there
,,Worth a quick look,4.0,,"Called past here after breakfast at the hawker center across the road. Was very interesting particularly the museum on the 3rd (maybe) floor which finally explained Buddhism in a simple manner!

There were chants going on and it was quite lively. Wear pants and a shirt to get in but I believe they lend you shalls to cover up if need be."
,,Wonderful temple,5.0,,A beautiful decorated temple. The bottom floor has a praying hall where you can attend Buddhist prayers. The 2 floors above have a small museum dedicated to the figure of Buddha with statues from various centuries and cultures. It is very nice to see how Buddha is depicted throughout history in different cultures. The top floor has the Buddha's tooth relic. The relic in itself is not visible but the room it is kept in and its container are worth the look. The roof is a small garden with thousands of miniature Buddha's on the walls with a small shrine and praying wheel in the middle. It is worth a visit.
,,Interesting and serene,3.0,,"Interesting to see inside a functioning temple and to take some time out and just reflect. The tooth relic was unable to be seen though as it is behind glass, in an elaborate altar-shrine tupe thing. Interesting display on Buddha's life."
,,Stunning interior,5.0,,"So opulent and over the top inside, it was great! Just beware to have your shoulders and knees covered. There are shawls at the entrance to use. Don't know if you had to pay for them. The whole area is fun to walk"
,,Great experience,5.0,,We were fortunate enough to go during a time of reading and payer. I enjoyed hearing the read/chant in unison. The sculptures are beautiful and the colors are amazing... it's nice to be allowed to look in to someone else's place of holiness . You must have your knees and shoulders covered to enter . A shawl or sarong is provided at the entrance if needed.
,,Blessing Buddhist style,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic temple is the very main Buddhist temple in Singapore. I guess, also in the whole South East Asia. You can treat this temple as a pure tourist attraction. There is really a lot to see there. But, you can also treat this place as spiritual recharge of your soul. Just look for one of the priests and ask him about a few minutes of talk. These are really wise people and can give you advice on many aspects of our life."
,,A must do,5.0,,Don't forget to visit the higher floors. You can get lucky and see a celebration live. Very open and friendly. Ladies will be given a blanket to cover their legs and shoulders if necessary.
,,A lot of interesting things to view,4.0,,It's a nice break to visit the temple in Chinatown. Many floors to explore. Can be nice to go when it's time for prayer!

,,Nice Temple in the middle of the city,4.0,,"This is walking distance from Chinatown. You can take the Chinatown MRT and walk towards this place. They provide sarong for the visitors who are wearing short sleeves or shorts and please practice silence especially if there's a ceremony going on. Afterwards, eat at the food stalls in Chinatown."
,,Beautiful place,3.0,,"This is located in Chinatown. Visiting the temple at prayer time was nice experience.Its a beautiful place.It has a museum too. If you are visiting Chinatown, then this should be in must visit list."
,,Amazing temple in full opperation,5.0,,"Not just one of them touristy spots but a stunning temple in full operation. Monks praying all around but still welcoming the tourists during their ceremonies. Pictures allowed, donations appreciated but not forced in any way."
,,Pearl within Chinatown,5.0,,"We usually take our foreign guests to visit this temple, showing the 12 Chinese zodiac signs and the temple downstairs, visiting the museum level, the shrine level, and taking them to the roof access with the 10,000 small Buddha statues and the roof garden with the big temple bell."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,Located in Chinatown...come early to beat the crowds of tourists. Wonderful temple and pagoda praising Buddha with numerous statues and relics. Many photo ops for the shutterbugs. Kids will enjou also.
,,I recommend it to everyone,5.0,,"I enjoyed visiting this temple, which is also a museum, a very interesting and beautiful place, I recommend it to everyone."
,,A very amazing temple inside!,4.0,,"This temple is in Chinatown about 5 minutes walk from Chinatown MRT subway station. Make sure you check Google maps for its location because it's not that easy to find once you're in Chinatown. The outside of the temple is nice but the inside is just spectacular and unlike most other Buddhist Temples I've been to, they actually let you take photos inside. Also, I believe that ladies need to wear long skirts or dresses inside but they will provide you with that. Oh and entry is free!"
,,Must visit when you're at Chinatown,5.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Chinatown, Singapore is a must visit when you're in the vicinity. I was left in awe at the gold statues."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"We walked around Chinatown in the early morning and more or less by accident stumbled onto this temple - had no idea that this is one of the big attractions with busloads of people arriving soon after us.

Found it very interesting though - we where politely asked to cover shoulders and knees with some sarongs provided and even where allowed to take some photos though in the chanting hall we did not take any out of respect (but many people did).

I don't understand enough about Buddhism to really appreciate this amazing place but it definitely had a aura of solemn contemplation."
,,Pray for Good Luck,4.0,,"This morning visited this unique temple located in Chinatown.

It's the 15th day of lunar 5th month. Many devotees praying asking for blessings. There were monks chanting in the inner temple. Beautiful bright interior with a huge altar. It was indeed very peaceful.

Slow walk to explore the temple. There's a museum within it. There's aldo a little shops selling souvenirs.

About 20 minutes to complete exploring the temple (without museum)."
,,Great way to see real Buddhist service,5.0,,"Came early morning and it was still quite busy. Gives a good insight into Buddhism, lots of artefacts, and a huge gold room where the tooth relic is held. Needs only about an hour, and is free (donations accepted)"
,,beautifu,5.0,,There is so much to take in as you walk around and if it is crowded it can feel a little rushed. The roof garden is stunning and strangely peaceful. A haven in a busy part of town
,,Peaceful,5.0,,The moment you walk in you feel the peace of this temple. Also visit the upper floors. Very interesting and quiet.
,,Calming and well maintained,5.0,,This was part of our Chinatown food tour and we later returned as we were quite impressed with the place. It is a great example of true faith and the place brought a relaxing calm to the group. We could have stayed there hours simply listening to rhythm of the songs by those who worshiped. It is a must to respect and dress appropriately for this place and would recommend for those who want to find inner peace. The building itself is excellent and also contains a museum which is well maintained.
,,Nice pagoda,5.0,,"From MRT Chinatown, exit A , go ahead on Pagoda street, and then turn right around 200 meters and the pagoda is in front of you."
,,The Temple,3.0,,There is a charge to take photos. Visit early morning. I got there around 12:00pm and couldn't walk on the tarred grounds because it was hot and remember you walk barefoot.
,,Beautiful attraction to see in Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,This is one of the most colorful and beautiful temples in Singapore to visit. We saw a line of chanting robed monks as we visited the site. A place to visit and take cool photos.
,,Interesting and informative,4.0,,"Don't know much about Buddism and stumbled across this temple when visiting Chinatown. The temple welcomes visitors and provides wrap overs/arounds so you can enter without causing offence. There are things to see and read on every floor and an elevator makes it more accessible for those with mobility difficulties. The temple also has public toilets which was much appreciated.
The temple has a calming atmosphere and you are encouraged to learn more via 'free' publications (a donation would be appropriate)."
,,A sham,1.0,,"Go ahead to visit and take pictures of the temple if you like the place, but please bear in mind that while it purports to possess a ""Buddha tooth relic"" after which the temple is named, the said relic is actually a bovine molar. I have never heard anywhere that any of the Buddhas was a buffalo or bull or cow or whatever."
,,Largest Buddha temple in Singapore,4.0,,Largest and most famous Buddha temple in Singapore. Dress up properly b4 you visit. It is located in Chinatown so Lot of eataries to enjoy local food & A good place to shop for souveniers.
,,One of the MUST VISIT temple in Singapore,5.0,,"I never fail to bring my oversea friends here and all were impressed. Sometimes you may catch up with some chanting sessions. There are a few floors... One floor is the display showing Buddha relics ... Kind of far... Cannot really see well but as a buddhist, we believed blessings will showered. If got time, you may mediate inside this hall, very peaceful and calm.
There is also a hall displaying many wall paintings with Buddha story ... Both in English and Chinese, take your time to follow through the simple yet interesting story.
There is a big turning wheel on the top floor... Turn it and Buddha will hear you and bless you...
Seeing is believing... Go..."
,,Mesmerizing Buddha temple,5.0,,The moment you enter the temple the all golden intricate art work enthrall you. It is a must see. You got to cover your legs and shoulder when you enter the temple. If you girls/women are in skirts or sleeveless you can take the stole that is kept at the entrance. Clicking is allowed. You will see yellow silk robed monks around. Its a very holy and happy atmosphere. The early morning prayers are good to watch they say but I did not get to go this time.
,,nice temple,4.0,,"Do not do many temples, but this was excellent with the info about buddha and the tooth, 4 storeys to explore with excellent items"
,,วัดพระเขี้ยวแก้ว Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,4.0,,วัดพระเขี้ยวแก้ว เป็นสถานที่ท่องเที่ยวทางวัฒนธรรม รวมถึงเป็นพิพิธภัณฑ์ทางศาสนาของชาวพุทธ ถูกสร้างขึ้นในปี พ.ศ. 2548 อยู่ในย่านไชน่าทาวน์ ใช้ทุนสร้างกว่า 62 ล้านเหรียญสิงคโปร์ เป็นสถาปัตยกรรมแบบราชวงศ์ถัง Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Cultural attractions Including a museum of Buddhist religion . Was built in 2548 in Chinatown . A budget of over 62 million US $ . Tang Dynasty architecture
,,Its a beautiful temple,4.0,,"Big temple, 5 floors and modern type. It is walking distances from outram & chinatown mrt, the temple is really beautiful inside and outside, it has story, videos, pictures and you can donate if you want or even do meditation peacefully inside. They have one small lift inside the temple, so you must be patient and queue especially during ceremony day or weekend & PH day. However, there are convenient stairs even for disable people."
,,Amazing Building and Location,4.0,,"Very beautiful temple located in the heart of china town. Travel to there very easy via subway , many shop and restaurant that you can tastes."
,,A Buddhist Temple and Tourist Place,4.0,,"The place is bustling with people especially during Lunar 1st and 15th of the month as Buddhist devotees will be following strict vegetarian.
The place is good to visit during the afternoon time from 1-5PM as it would be less crowded and the temple open quite late.
If you would like to take some photos, it is recommended to come after 7PM but the temple should be closed by then."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,Loved my experience here. It was such a beautiful temple. The Buddha tooth was really far away so only saw it on the screens outside the shrine. My husband and I took our time and visited all the floors and really enjoyed our time there. Remember to visit the roof-top garden; it is really serene!
,,Beautiful and special place,5.0,,Beautiful temple and it has Buddha tooth on the 4th floor. If you go there definitely go on the 4th floor. Temple is free for public but you can donate if you want. We donated some money because we had a really great experience and spent there cca 2 hours. Would recommend to any body.
,,Beautiful and special place,5.0,,"Big temple, special. You can feel some energy there. It's free for public and you can donate if you want. We were fortunate enough that they just started praying when we came and that was great experience because we were never in that kind of temple. Would recommend to anyone. On the forth floor is Tooth of Buddha and that floor is really amazing. If you are there don't miss 4th floor."
,,Pretty. but a strange contradiction?,2.0,,"Perhaps this is a ""living museum"" in that it is a temple in regular use. It seems strange that a religion which emphasises withdrawal from worldly things and the elimination of ""desire"" should be displaying so much gold everywhere! The upper floors have ""the tooth"" and a large prayer wheel enclosure."
,,Buddhist Church/Temple in Chinatown,4.0,,It is a beautiful temple. Vistors welcomed. Lovely art work in the temple. Gold gold gold everywhere. You need to wear a wrap for both men and women.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Our tour guide gave us great information about this enormous temple. Be sure to step inside for other great photos.
,,Pretty View!!,5.0,,"I have seen this from outside, didn't had the opportunity to visit inside the temple. Its was around 9 when i was there. People around said it's open twice a Year. Not sure of this, Although it looked very pretty."
,,Good place for worship,3.0,,"Good place for worship, this temple attracts decent amount of tourist, don't be worried about rush, it is very well managed in Singapore. Good religious place"
,,Best temple,5.0,,"Best temple we have visited. An active temple so there are people meditating, chanting, praying, and so on. You get a good view of the Temple's vision and ceremony so worth visiting."
,,Waste time. Nothing to see.,1.0,,Nothing to see and waste of time. Careful of the smokes from burning incense as they pose danger threat to health. It is 2nd smoke. Spend your time at other places better.
,,Very Old Chines Temple,5.0,,"This is place is in china town, and must see place in singapore. this temple has 100 Buddha statue. next to this temple there is colorful shopping place is there. people can buy things very cheap."
,,Great even for non-Buddhists,5.0,,"This temple is a great place to visit to feel a spiritual connection even if you're not Buddhist. They require that visitors' legs and shoulders are covered, so don't wear shorts or tank tops if you plan to visit (or, they *do* have sarongs and shawls you can borrow before entering). There are 5 levels to this temple, so plan to spend a bit of time here. Even if you just visit the lower level, it's worth the stop. There are beautiful statues everywhere and the Buddha tooth is up on the 4th level."
,,Ornate 4th-Floor Stupa,3.0,,"I'm not particularly religious, but I've been to many Buddhist temples and other religious churches during my lifetime, so I have a lot to compare it to. It's free to enter, but you'll constantly be ""subtly"" reminded to ""donate"" every few steps. The noteworthy thing to see here is the stupa that houses the tooth relic, which is on the 4th floor. You can't get close to the actual tooth, but the ornate, gold shrine that it's housed in is lavish and ground. Unfortunately, pictures can't be taken, so take it all in! They've also got a small rooftop garden that's upstairs that I found tranquil. The 2nd and 3rd floors are the museum, while the 1st floor houses many Buddhist statues and prayer worship is conducted. It's worth a trip for the devoutly Buddhist and worth a look/peek if you're not and in the immediate Chinatown area."
,,Should Go if time permits,4.0,,"Very beautiful place. Appropriate dressings please, scarves are provided for cover up if needed. Near Chinatown."
,,NIce Calming experience,5.0,,"visited during my recent Singapore trip. The temple had Nice calming impact, with so many idols of Buddha one gets transformed into a different world"
,,Quite meditation,4.0,,Interesting that this is located next too all the tourist souvenier stalls in Chinatown. Make sure you find your way to the upper floors but make sure you are dressed appropriately. There is a dress code!
,,Stunning,4.0,,"We arrived close to closing so we had to rush around a bit, and I am sure we missed out on some of the atmosphere of the place. But it is absolutely beautiful, just allow yourself more than 30 minutes!"
,,A must,5.0,,"Check it out - you will not be disappointed. Week ends can be busy, but hey join the queue, and enjoy the seights and sounds around you"
,,"Very modern, very photogenic air-conditioned temple",3.0,,"Small wonder why this temple appears all over Instagram as it is truly very photogenic, and it even house a museum with many ancient sacred relics contained inside. However, it doesn't feel like a true temple to soak in the heritage of the Buddhism and would seem more like a for-profit temple."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Visted this temple just as a service was starting, very spiritual. The decor was gold and red, statues of deities, beautiful to see and peaceful."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Definitely recommend too visit. Walking distance from Chinatown MRT, a grand temple with intricate and majestic design. Really awesome. Will need around 20-25 mins with a small museum aso upstairs."
,,Impressive both on the outside and inside,4.0,,"When you see it from the streets, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a beautiful structure. And it is just as beautiful when you go in. It is wonderfully decorated with so many buddha statues and the altars are very majestic. Definitely worth seeing when you are in Chinatown!"
,,For the spiritual ones,3.0,,"The tooth relic museum is not a great attraction for everybody. If you are spiritually inclined or just love the peace and silence of this place, it might be a good option for you to visit. There is a space to meditate in silence which is very good."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,We went in during prayer time and this was good time to see the worshipping. It was a nice experience overall. Its similar to my own cultural background. The idols are beautifully adorned. Its definitely a must do for the devout and regular tourists too.
,,My first visit to Buddha temple,5.0,,"It was a wonderful experience . An experiance to know every religion is scared and holy .They do have dress code , mostly we need to wear dress which covers the hand and legs .

when we went there were family prayers going on. Lot of tourist come in to see the temple.the architecture is beautiful with different BUDDHA meditation position.

Silence is so"
,,Fascinating look into Buddhist history,5.0,,"The first floor is the most public part of the temple, but there is so much more on the upper floors. There is a museum of the Buddha's life the 3rd floor, a wax museum on the mezzanine. The tooth relic of the Buddha is on the 4th floor and is absolutely gorgeous. My absolute favorite aspect was the rooftop orchid garden and the prayer wheel. It was a surprisingly serene place in an area that is bustling with busy lives. Free to enter, but they accept donations of course. If you have bare arms or a short skirt, you will be asked to cover up, but they provide wraps by the front door that you can borrow."
,,Heritage temple for tourists,4.0,,It is the place to go for tourists as this is a modern architecture with Chinese elements. Pretty crowded
,,Modern Chinese Temple,4.0,,Amazing building offset by modern and old architecture. Free entry requires. Wonderful experience. Be sure to make your way up to the 3rd floor to see ancient artifacts with stories too.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,This is a must see in Singapore. We were there when they were doing a family prayer service and when the awoke the gods. It was so interesting to see and learn about this religion.
,,Happy Vesok Day!!,5.0,,Absolutely stunning! A lot of people just stick to the bottom level but definitely make your way to the elevator (I had to ask.. It's not exactly visible from the main entrance) and take a trip to every floor including the beautiful gardens and temple of 10000 Buddhas on the rooftop. I was hesitant to enter the 4th floor tooth relic but staff are really nice and explain to you that you can walk around the service even when it's in full swing. Definitely a must see for every tourist.
,,Modern Chinese Buddhist temple,5.0,,"the place to see thousands of glittering gold Buddha statues lining bright red walls, accompanied by a room full of chanting monks and lay people."
,,Only Buddhist Temple in Singapore,5.0,,"I was a bit shocked when I saw only Buddhist temple at Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. However, it's not bad to see the temple and museum, especially buddha statue arts."
,,A lot of Buddha,4.0,,"This is probably the most Buddhas I've seen in one temple. It's wild. We just walked through, didn't really investigate of the meanings or use of the temple. But it's definitely impressive!"
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,I loved visiting this place. 1000 Buddha's! Women please cover up for respect or you can not go in. Beautiful statues and right next to Chinatown where there is lots of foods and ice cream :)
,,Great Temple in China Town,5.0,,"Spectacular temple in China Town, access is free with a beautiful tranquil roof garden on the to. The temple is provided with a lift."
,,Very spiritual place,4.0,,"During our visit, there was a ""service"" taking place. The chanting was nice to hear and interesting to watch. Well worth a visit."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"It is beautiful. There are 3 floors of exhibits / spiritual places in the same temple complex, with ornate artefacts. It has a clean loo. Silence needs to be observed as people may be praying / meditating."
,,A Must see (For me),5.0,,"This temple has a buddha tooth and some more relics, there is inside hundreds of different buddhas all over the place in the first floor, also you can see a ceremony when it take place. In the upper levels, you will feel some kind of mystique place, some scultures and stuff about buddism. Also, outside there are a place where everybody is playing game of checkers, it was a unique experience for me that around one game could be more than 10 viewers. (December 2013)"
,,No Toothdecay for this Buddha,4.0,,"Its a bit of an oddity - its almost a commercial temple, but its friendly (provided you do respect there rights and beliefs) and a fascinating insight.
The worshipers have there place downstairs almost boxed in by the tourist watching the proceedings taken place, but an elevator will take you to different levels within inside this complex. Obviously there the floor housing the Budhas tooth but this almost pales into the background once you see the use of goldern ornaments surrounding the room. The very top floor has a garden which is walled in to provide and sanctuary from the high speed life of Singapore which is on its doorstep."
,,A must to visit when in China Town,5.0,,It is not an old building but it is well worth the time. You will need to cover shoulders and not wear short skirt. The ground floor is only a small part of this building. All floors are worth visiting and take time to find the garden at the very top with the prayer wheel.
,,A Temple to Protect and Venerate Buddha's tooth,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple houses a relic said to be a tooth from Buddha. It is contained in a giant stupa weighing 3.5 tonnes and made from 320kg of gold. 234kg of this gold were donated by devotees.

Colourful. Lots of gold. And cool. It'll provide respite from the heat on a hot day.

And good eating places around. Check out Maxwell Hawker Centre just a couple of minutes walk away."
,,nice temple,3.0,,"stunning temple...goergous...if u have time..it is worth the visit. beside temple for praying, there is museum, gallery and library"
,,Must Visit Singaporean Site,4.0,,"Well worth a visit to see the intricate exterior, also go inside for an insight into their beliefs. When we visited a service was just starting, so a bonus. Entry is free although small donations are always welcomed. Close to Chinatown"
,,An amazing place to visit - just show respect inside the building,5.0,,"What an amazing place. The city tour bus parks just outside the temple, and if you journey inside, you will be rewarded with an amazing visit. I was there during the day, and the monks and worshipers were in a continuous chant and readings in the main room. You can explore and search for your Chinese year and astrological animal too.
Picture taking is OK, just show respect to the worshipers."
,,Stunning,5.0,,We visited the Buddha Tooth Temple as part of a day tour of Singapore and sadly missed the upper floors. The amount of Buddhas around the temple is just staggering. The mantras that where being chanted was really relaxing. Well worth a visit.
,,something traditional in the heart of modenization,5.0,,the inside of this place is gorgeous. and cool. which was a nice break from the heat outside. and right next to it are great places to eat at. which makes it more awesome
,,"You won't get ""all temples out"" from this place.",4.0,,"This was an accidental find of mine on this trip and it was definitely worth it. If it wasn't so hot when I went there I could most probably sit outside and just enjoy the stunning architecture.

Make sure you go up to the top if you are physically able."
,,So many people but fun.,5.0,,So many people both tourist and locals. Food restaurants are all over. People eat non stop from one corner to the other. Food is very reasonable.
,,a hint of culture,4.0,,"We went around 9 ish in China town because we had just brought a post card and thought whoop that looks cool but the lights weren't on when we get there otherwise I reckon I would reviewed this as excellent.
Great to see the size of it and be in China town a must do too!"
,,Didn't see the tooth,4.0,,"My husband and I visited Singapore for a medical meeting. I had more time than he did so we combined a trip to the Maxwell food center and the Temple. They are very close. We had visited Beijing a few years ago and were so impressed by the temples there and their rich history. This temple in Singapore we realized had been recently built, which was a surprise if not a disappointment. I hope not to offend, but it seemed excessively touristy. Buddhist monks performed a ceremony while we were there. It is certainly a photo opp. I have beautiful shots. There were slots to donate coins everywhere which were offered to specific ""buddhas"". Women that walk in with bare shoulders are offered shawls before entering the temple. A meaningful part of the Temple visit was lighting an insence stick and placing it in the offering outside the Temple door. I hope that my prayer was heard because I felt that it was."
,,Interesting peek into an authentic and active temple,5.0,,Wonderful experience. Be sure to make your way up to the 3rd floor to see ancient artifacts with stories too.
,,not to be confused with....,4.0,,"Not to be confused with the Sri Mariamman Temple which is just down the road and which a taxi took us to by mistake - very different. This temple is friendly and educational but is also very beautiful and awe inspiring. Regardless of beliefs or spirituality the art work itself is worth a visit - another awe inspiring aspect is the calmness of the man who sits there directing people to the roof garden and then to remove their shoes, which he must do hundreds of times. Deceptive from the outside the temple is new and on many floors accessible via a pretty lift. Free to enter donations points available but no pressures. Definitely worth a visit when in Chinatown."
,,serene and calm,5.0,,"in the middle of the madness of chinatown, this is a beautiful oasis. make sure you go to the rooftop, there is a level little garden to rest up, and a serene temple."
,,Informative and enlightening,4.0,,"Very informative, with the documented historical rundown of events. Enlightening on the life of Buddha and provides opportunity for self-reflection..."
,,Fanstastic free sight in Singapore's Chinatown,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is located on South Bridge Rd.
This is one of those free tourist gems.
This has to be one of the most ornate and amazing Buddhist Temples I have seen. The outside is rather unassuming, but once inside, the amount of red with gold leaf is absolutely amazing.
With some 10000 Buddha figurines along the walls and a many other statues throughout, this place is outstanding.
The roof garden is a small oasis in the city.
The museum is good as well with many artifacts dating back a large number of years. The statues of previous monks are brilliant and so lifelike.
This is an amazing temple and well worth a visit. It is also one of the few free things to see."
,,Stunning Temple,5.0,,"Definitely work a visit if you are in Singapore! Make sure you get the lift to the floors above, which I think could be easily missed."
,,Very beautiful temple,5.0,,Very beautiful temple and a must do when in Singapore. The place looks very nice with all the lights. Try to stay up to the time when the monks are chanting.
,,Beautiful Buddhist temple,5.0,,"Being in the dental field as a hygienist, I just had to see the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. It was built only about 10 or 11 years ago, and was truly magnificent. It is an active temple and while we there, monks and other devotees were chanting and worshipping, but it was ok for visitors to walk around and even take some pictures. The 2nd floor was a museum about the life of Buddha and was very educational, and the 3rd floor was also a Buddhist museum. The actual tooth relic was on the 4th floor, and no shoes or photos were allowed. But wow! The entire 4th floor was very beautiful and reverent and spiritual.
One could only see a photograph of the tooth relic, because the actual tooth is in an ornate gold encasement, in another ornate gold encasement, etc, in a room sealed off from the public by glass.
On the rooftop there is a garden with hundreds of very little Buddhas, that can be sponsored.
There were elevators to take you to the various floors.
In all we spent about 2 hours there because there was so much to see."
,,Large Striking Temple in China Town,4.0,,Visited as part of a tour so had limited time to visit - but impression was very of a large handsome building that will repay revisiting. The inside is a vision in Red and Gold - with many devotees praying.
,,Beautiful building,4.0,,Amazing building offset by modern and old architecture nearby. Free entry requires about 30 minutes to visit. We were there on Buddha's official birthday.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful temples I have been to. We seen many cathedrals so this was nice to see something different. It was gorgeous and very ornate. It may look simple on the outside, but it is beautiful on the inside. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Great temple,5.0,,"Found this temple by mistake as we were walking around, it is a great place to visit and see monks chanting - a very impressive temple"
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is a peaceful place in the heart of bustling Chinatown. On the ground floor there are huge statues and the walls are made of small gold Buddhas in box like structures. On the second floor there is a small museum on the walkway around the inside of the building. Where the tooth relic is displayed there is so much gold. Even the tiles are gold plated. It is necessary to remove your shoes on this floor and shawls are provided for those showing too much skin. This area is very sacred and devotees can be seen praying on the platforms on the side of this magnificent room. At the very top of the building there is a peaceful garden ( hard to believe you are in the middle of bustling Chinatown).

But I felt this feeling of holiness and felt like I am a local of Singapore. Dress code was strictly implemented-for those wear shorts while touring around, don't worry, there are few cloth-wrap for you to use for free :) This five-storey building will surely give you chills because of its sacredness all over the place.

There is no entrance fee, and it definitely worth the trip to Chinatown. Make sure you visit the upper floors of this temple, because that's where they have some amazing artifacts about Buddha in their museum. My kids liked this temple too. They loved all the dragon murals and tapestry here. Definitely a must if going to Chinatown. For all vegetarians, there is an amazing vegetarian restaurant, just steps away from the temple. It is called ""Eight Treasures,"" and it is absolutely divine. Just yelp it to find out about their signature dishes. You will not be disappointed."
,,A corner of peace,4.0,,"It was not the first time I'm visiting this temple.
It was renowned on 2007, and it immediately gathered a lot of attention.
The mix of gold and red, together with the always running ceremony helps the people to stop thinking to the buzzing life and start to be more concentrated to themselves.
Divided on several floors (the best view for me is from the mezzanine for the East part) it has also a sort of museum where people not really knowledgeable of Buddhism can start to understand the various parts of it looking at all artifacts, some of them very old, very helpful comments. The floor with the believed ;Buddha tooth is magnificent. On the fourth floor a beautiful Zen garged all done by orchids.
E really fulfilling experience if you want to cut the Singapore crazy life with sometime for yourself."
,,Galor of Holistic feel of enshrined Bhudda...,5.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic museum is a must visit attraction in Chinatown..Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is just located at a foot walk distance from the MRT Chinatown station, as I walked up the traditionally built and renovated Chinese house, I was fascinated seeing those colourful architecture that reflects the Chinese tradition and gives an authentic feel of Chinatown. This temple is 5 a story building built encompassing traditional Tibetan Chinese architecture structure and is easily one of most intriguing and elaborate Temples of Buddha. There is no entrance fee but you can do make donations generously. Every floor is decked out and adorned and decorated with thousands of glowing lanterns, Buddhist images, gilded in gold and artistic colours and decor, elaborate statues of Lord Buddha’s meditation , enlighten posture and the followers of Buddha and other religious accoutrements tablets and artefacts. Two entire floors in this temple are dedicated to the temple’s museum, which has an impressive and vast collection of Buddhist statues from all the Asian Buddhist nations including Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Japan, Sri Lanka and India, these statues were so intricate that I couldn’t take of my eyes admiring the intricate carvings of the statues ranging miniature to mega scale. There is a big prayer hall where the monks and monastery priests were making recitation of the chants, the hall itself if like a heaven on earth glittering with lights and calmness and could a feel of meditation soul and ambience in it. In the centre of the podium Large Statue of Buddha is enshrined. As I ascended to the floor i reached the center of main attraction , place where the Tooth relic of Buddha is preserved in a gold gilded chamber with exotic decoration and ornamental chamber studded with precious stones and metal, I just sat there for a moment meditating. The hall itself is very much holistic and we could feel a heavenly ambience. There is another gallery to preserve the mortal remains of the Chinese Buddhist descendants and dignitaries in tablets. As I ascended to the top fifth floor, there is a well maintained rooftop garden bursting with gorgeous colourful orchids. The centre of the roof, housed in its own room, rests the world’s largest cloisonné prayer wheel, Tibetan style. If you’re into temples, Buddhism or museums, I spent 3 hours in this temple, it’s really a spectacular and holistic evocation ambience place."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,Worth seeing when in Chinatown. Temple is beautiful and it is nice that they let the general public through to have a look.

,,"You must see, feel, smell, listen to it!",5.0,,"Chinese Buddhist temple where you can see monks and devotees chanting, praying, meditating. This is not ""just"" a temple, but also a museum where you can see lots of precious Asian Buddhist artifacts and can learn about Buddha Sakyamuni and Maitreya, the next Buddha."
,,It welcomes all,4.0,,"This is a beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown. It's quite a new temple as it was only built a couple of year back but the guiding committee had made great efforts to bring in / loan artifacts from other temples and from private collectors.

The temple is open to all and one of the key activities is to offer to light a lamp, offer flowers or food to the Dharma.

You can visit it any time of the year but during major Buddhist or Chinese festival, the temple is decorated in bright colour and ornaments (like the one from Chinese New Year I've enclosed).

At the top of the temple is a roof garden with a large prayer wheel which you can turn.

On the fourth and third floors are artifacts of Buddhist faith for viewing and sometime attendant monks would offering blessings to worshippers. There used to be a section for historical Buddhist scriptures / books but it was removed likely because conditions are not so good for the delicate artifacts.

The second floor or mezzanine level consist of a walkway that encircle the Great Hall, visitors can view the lifelike wax statues of highly ordained Buddhist monks."

If you would like to visit the place, I recommend to visit it on weekdays."
,,Go to the 4th floor for the tooth chamber,5.0,,"Downstairs is a beautiful temple, but nothing special compared to many other Buddhist temples. The tooth chamber is another story. It is one of the beautiful rooms I've ever seen. The peaceful energy emanating from the room is inexplicable. There's nothing else I can say that can do it justice so I'll say: just go!"

,,Peaceful and Beautiful,5.0,,The peace and beauty of the place gets to you. I felt strangely at peace inside this holy place. I am a Hindu. but despite that felt a kind of meditative calmness amongst rich golden idols etc. Strange thing is I found some idols similar to navagraha type inside this temple. Lotus flowers are offered for worship. Wish I could spend more time sititng inside this temple. This is in China town and right next to it there is a street full of small shops. We also have china town information centre near this temple.
,,Calm and spiritual,5.0,,"A very calm place in the middle of the China town. This place is really capable of relaxing your mind, including a place for meditation as well."
,,Learnt new things at a grand place,4.0,,"Went with a friend for the first time ever(even as a local) and was awed by L1, where the hall of statues were grand. We purchased a bowl of coins and dropped one each into the alms cup. (I need to be frank here and say the sound of coins are jarring and it echoed through the hall. Not pleasant for a place of worship) L2 is like a mini art museum for buddhism and it tells the story of Buddha. L3 is this place where some devotees meditate and it is also a place where the Buddha tooth relic is secured for viewing (far away). Lastly, they have a rooftop garden and a praying wheel there. The place is grand, but I'm not sure if I want to go back again."
,,So peaceful in a busy city,5.0,,"A great history lesson of the many Buddha's through the ages.
See if you can find your Buddha by the year of your birth, we did.
Don't limit your visit to the ground floor
First go right up to the 5th Floor roof garden, then work your way down through the many exhibits on each floor. You will soon arrive at the Tooth Relic meditation room.
Wow all the red and gold is fantastic. So peaceful in here.
On the ground floor you will find the largest Buddha statues, breathtaking.
Great place to visit and must not be missed when visiting Chinatown in Singapore."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"This temple is quite significant religiously, for the Buddhists. There is a prayer hall with the statues in the ground floor and lot of display in the 4 floors above. Buddha's tooth is kept in one of the upper floors, but is not displayed. There is a garden and prayer bell on the terrace.
The places is quite ornate and well maintained.

,,Magnificent Temple in Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,This beautiful Temple is only about a ten minute walk from the Park Royal on Pickering Hotel.

,,Modern yet traditional,4.0,,"I live in Taiwan so I've seen many similar temples, but this place is really ornate. It's very new, so everything is very clean and there is a very modern feel to each tiny little detail of the temple. The fact that it's in a really vibrant area just makes it even better."
,,Very interesting!,4.0,,This is a great place to see the Buddhist chant. While we were there they chanted nonstop. Interesting place - but we never saw Buddha's tooth (so could be just a name)..

,,This place was pure amazing. Do Not Miss!,5.0,,"If you are like me and love temples, architecture and history, this is one attraction in Singapore you do not want to miss and the best part was that it is free.

A local businessman decided he would donate a large sum of his money into building this fabulous temple. The place totally reminded me of something like right out of Big Trouble, Little China. The temple is located near the middle of China town and is not hard to spot at all.

It is a multi-level temple with the main worship area taking up the ground floor and the open ceiling taking up much of the second floor space.

There is an elevator and a set of stairs that will take you to the top. There are several floors which have a number of rooms which offer a great variety of artwork, sculptures and many other historical artifacts and items. One of my favorite rooms was the one that had the large well made placard walls that described the life of Buddha.

The top of the temple cannot be skipped. It has nice gardens and one of those large Buddhist bell devices. There are enough items in this place that you could have enough photo opportunities that would last a full day or two.

There is a gift shop near the entrance set on the China Town side. You may see some monks. As a matter of fact I could have sworn I had seen a few interspersed between life sized statues on the second level."
,,"Incredible, stunningly beautiful",5.0,,This temple is THE most beautiful temple I've ever visited. Ladies need to wear a sarong to cover your legs and also while there light an incense stock and say a prayer. This is a must do.
,,Sumptuous Buddhhist Temple,5.0,,"This is a very rich and ornate Budhhist Temple in Chinatown, It is popular with locals and tourists both. The inner shrine has a gigantic gold Budhha and the surroundings are very rich and ornate. As it has a tooth of Buddah is it a place of pilgrimage and is quite crowded with tour bus loads of Chnese and foreigners to visit it."
,,A calm buddhist place,5.0,,"Experience: Very good. We visited the china town and found this. As you walk through the place there are many idols of Buddha with many mudras. Do scan the interiors well :)

2. You do not need any guide for this place.
3. It has a roof garden. You can spend some time there if you are tired.

,,Touch to Buddhism and History,4.0,,"Situated at the center of China Town shopping area, it's 5 storeyed building/temple. If you are wearing short clothes, specially women they provide you stoles to cover you naked legs and arms. Other than that I did not find any odd thing. They allow you to walk in with slippers on, except one floor which has tooth relic kept. People can come here for meditation/ visiting the Budhha museum. The museum is full of information and describes the story of Buddhu in his own words (You have a read a lot). The top most floor has a garden and a huge turn-able cylindrical which has mantras scripted on it.

The place in front of this temple is happening too. We could see some old people performing in huge numbers. Like a flash mob."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"A beautiful temple, well worth a visit. Unoffical guides will try to snag you at the main enterance and take you thru the temple but expect to be taken to his sisters jewellery shop after the tour."
,,"Magnificent, but packed",3.0,,"If you like very grand and showy temples, then you will love this one - massive amounts of gold and red, and a zillion people jammed into the main ground floor halls. I had read that there was a peaceful meditation area and garden on the roof, but if there is its not available to tourists.
Can't fault the temple, though I believe that all that gold kinda goes directly in opposition to buddhist principles"
,,Nothing special at all!,3.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is not so special at all. You can find much more authentic temples in Thailand or Cambodia, I guess. But still culture is not the main reason why to travel to Singapore."
,,Buddhist,4.0,,This is a very good pretty Buddhist temple here.very clean and tastefully built.A good temple for a quick visit.Lots of locals.
,,Simply stunning temple,5.0,,"I only had a short period of time on a Sunday morning whilst waiting for my tour bus to arrive to quickly enter this most stunning of Buddhist temples in Singapore's Chinatown district. I was most fortunate that on this morning the Buddhist monks were conducting prayers, it was an amazing experience I feel so privileged to have seen.

Having visited many beautiful Buddhist temples in Thailand I can confidently say this temples is outstanding in its beauty. Lining its walls are miniature figures of Buddha with the hands in the various poses, I think there's in excess of 1,000. The decoration of this temple is a sight to behold, it took my breath away.

I hope you too have an opportunity to see this temple, and are also lucky enough to see a prayer session, it's rather special."

,,A treasure house of Buddhist art,5.0,,"We hadn't realised that this temple had such a rich collection of Buddhist art from 2nd century CE ( Gandharan) to the present, from countries across Asia. It's the most impressive collection I have seen, and free to enjoy when visiting the temple. It is all organised around the narrative of the Buddha's life and ideas.

The temple itself is a glorious gold and colourful place. The room that contains the stupa with the tooth can only be viewed through a window. Not surprising given the amount of gold in the room. But a close up of the tooth can be seen in a video.
I will go back. The museum shut at 6 and I hadn't given myself enough time to digest everything."
,,Peaceful and impressive temple,5.0,,"We enjoyed the visit to the temple and to museum very much.

Next floor is the museum, you will found a lot of antiques Buddha related. Third floor is where the wax statues of the monks are, very realistic, better than Madame Toussard!

It's a functioning temple located in Chinatown. There are many individal Buddha shrines in the temple and explanations of their religious significance. It's visually breathtaking and drips with gold. There were preparations for the Chinese New Year when I went and there were coloured lanterns and additional decorations in preparation for that.
It houses a museum and rooftop orchid garden on its upper floors, Admission is free though donations are accepted.
This calm and spiritual place really is unmissable and highly recommended."
,,Buddha temple,5.0,,"make sure you follow the rules on this one, i think one of the priests felt sorry for me, lending me a cotton robe to wear, but i was under strict instruction, no photographs of inside to be taken or of idols, luckily i was more interested in the art and architecture."

,,Worth seeing when visiting Chinatown ...,5.0,,"A relatively new temple (2007) and one which is pretty impressive both internally and externally. We were fortunate enough to see a big service taking place but were still able to use a camera - the lighting is bright enough inside not to need flash - to record some of our visit.

This makes a good contrast to the Hindu Sri Mariamman temple which is just a few minutes away in Chinatown."

,,Interesting temple and history in the middle of a city,4.0,,"Even though I have been to singapore a few times this is the first time going inside.
First of all make sure you have something that covers your shoulders and knees. They do provide shaws and wraps but you don't know how many people have used them.

,,Outstanding Chinese Temple,5.0,,"Located in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is an extremely interesting place to visit. It is a relatively new building, completed in 2007. On the fifth level (top floor), we found what was described as the world's largest prayer wheel. Surrounding this prayer wheel and throughout this level were 10,000 miniature Buddhas. This level also had a beautiful rooftop garden with orchids. On the fourth level was the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha encased in a transparent container. The remainder of the fourth level was devoted to places for individual prayer and meditation and part of the museum with many interesting carvings. The second and third levels were galleries with various exhibits including life-like statues of former important Buddhists and important bronzes. The mezzanine overlooked the sanctuary. At the time of our visit a service was taking place and we could observe the service without disturbing the participants. The ground level included the sanctuary and other important statues of Buddha and other important Buddhist statues. It was an extremely impressive building and collection that was well worth our time."

,,Interesting place,4.0,,"We did not realize what the significance of yhis temple was as we walked by and yhought would check it out to get out of yhe sun for a while. Despite the prayers taking place, we were made to feel welcome to witness what was happening.

,,Magnificent Buddhist temple,4.0,,"Huge and beautiful Buddhist temple near the Maxwell Food Center in Chinatown. Free to visit and you can take pictures freely with flash. The interior is simple breathtaking! The place is a bit too handicap friendly, because you can only go upstairs with an elevator but it had a long line so we didn't wait for it.

,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,I was in Singapore's Chinatown & I grew tired of the same old hawker stalls. I did a search of nearby attractions on Trip Advisor & this Buddist Temple shows up with many 5 star ratings. It is completely amazing with 4 levels of devotion & artifacts. It was not so crowded so I just wandered around taking in the reverence. Every level is different and no expense has been spared in showcasing the devotion to the deity. Level 3 has many stone & timber artifacts which date back many centuries. Level 4 is a gobsmacking shrine to the deity and a piece of his jaw. Believe it or not. It is worth the trip to the roof level where you will find a peaceful garden for some quiet contemplation.

The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was no exception and I could have taken photos there all day. Room after room of amazing statues and decorations - tributes to the enlightened one all over the place. You can even purchase a small floral wreath with a candle to leave as a token of your faith. So colorful and vivid - a do not miss in the Lion City."

This place located near chinatown. To get there, take MRT to Chinatown and then 10 minutes walk."
,,Excellent collection of artifacts related to Buddha,5.0,,"Been here 3 times, cant find it enough.
There are so many varieties of buddhas from all over the world, that I cant remember each of them. The buddha's tooth relic is a mesmerising experience.

There is a lot to photograph and enjoy looking at all the carvings and gilded objects. It is interesting too to see locals praying and paying their respects to the Buddha.

Then you can settle in one of the local restaurants and enjoy a reasonably priced meal.
,,Wonderfully decorated,5.0,,"Not sure what I was expecting but it was beautifully designed. This is a new build (finished in 2007) replacing the old temple. but WOW! very ornate inside. Not really appreciated how many 'God's' they pray to, but I do now! Very Beautiful"

Take some time to read at artifacts displayed there. They give free material promoting Buddhism.
You may club the temple visit with Chinatown market (Pagoda street) and Heritage center."
,,The Best Collection of Relics I have Seen,5.0,,"The most attractive about this temple is the collection of Buddhist artefacts and relics. Relics are said to be the remains of parts of body after cremation. It is also believed that the holier a person is, the more relics would be found after cremation. Relics of the Buddha and his disciples have been passed down until today, ended up in established temples.

Whether one believes the relics are as represented, the collection of relics in this temple is amazing!"
,,Fascinating and cool!,5.0,,"This is a fascinating Buddhist Temple. The building is modern and air-conditioned ( a real plus in steamy Singapore), but gives an impression of centuries of history. There are excellent museum and exhibit areas, and, of course, the temple areas are amazing to view. Even children would love the reverential atmosphere of chanting monks, and would enjoy finding their own particular gods by their year of birth. There are a number of storeys, served by a lift, culminating in a peaceful rooftop garden."
,,A beautiful and tranquil place,4.0,,The temple itself is incredibly beautiful and has a wonderfully tranquil feeling. The roof garden is also worth a visit. The museum and galleries are interesting and would be particularly good for anyone with a curiosity of Buddhism.
,,Humbling,5.0,,Wow a spiritual experience. Make sure you take the time to do all the floors from the garden to the museum
,,Absolutely fascinating,4.0,,We arrived at the temple just as a celebration was about to start. I was amazed that tourists were allowed to take photos but I am glad they did because I captured some very special moments on my camera. The building was very ornate & full of interest.

,,Eye opening Temple,5.0,,"Used to come Chinatown when I was young. Walk past Chinatown while I look for dinner. I was kind of wow and didn't expect to see such a big temple at Chinatown. The temple is gigantic and the view is beautiful. Walk past here twice before and after my meal, so I happen to see the view before sunset and after sunset. Both scenery of this temple Is different.

Noted that the temple is closed at night. As I walked past, I saw a chain of lantern are beautiful lit up along the pathway. The temple lights began to shine from different level as I was standing far away from the temple.

Came to tripadvisor and realise it is very famous hotspot too. Hope you enjoy!"
,,Nice temple and worth a visit,3.0,,This is a working temple so please be mindful of worshippers. It is very unlike of a buddha temple that I had imagined. My view of Buddha was simple with no pomp. This temple is exactly the opposite. Worth a visit.
,,Nice Temple,4.0,,"It is a nice, rather modern museum. On one of the upper levels you could see a few relics other than where the tooth relic is kept. You can arrange guided tours as well, especially if you travel in groups. I would recommend it as they can explain the statues, figures, and even architectural influences. Understanding this makes it more meaningful than just walking around aimlessly."
,,Great Temple,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is at the end of Chinatown, which shouldn't be missed. It has 4 floors with a lift and great views from the rooftop. The ground praying hall is richly and nicely decorated. Been there during praying time...fantastic atmosphere."
,,Peaceful & Meditative Place,5.0,,"The temple was beautiful and ornate, red and gold but extremely peaceful and meditative. We went up to the roof to enjoy the tranquil little garden with the giant bell. On the 3rd floor, they had a exhibit of the History of Buddhism and Relics and on the 2nd floor was a meditation hall. It was nice to visit, a good n educational trip for the kids, even though we are Malaysian Chinese and used to seeing temples. This temple was lovingly kept, well planned and managed."
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,"Very beautiful temple in the heart of China town. But don't expect to really see the tooth relic. It's a in a box, inside a glassroom. Impossible to see. The rooftop is amazing though, must go!"
,,"A great complex to visit. Main temple on ground floor, a museum, exhibits, a garden area, and the Buddah Tooth Shrine",4.0,,"This is a great place to see the full range of Buddhist related experiences. A very impressive temple on the first floor with many ceremonies going on, an amazing museum upstairs with an incredible collection of Buddhas, and of course the Buddha Tooth which is very interesting (there is even space on both sides of the room for Buddhists to meditate here), and a garden area on the highest floor. To appreciate all this oyu need some time so you should allow 2 hours for this at least. Very special place right on the edge of Chinatown"
,,Visiting Chinatown,5.0,,This is a must if you are into Chinese history you can easily spend a good few hours going round this museum and the exhibits in side are amazing
,,Stunning Experience!,5.0,,"We've often visited China Town and walked past admiring the lovely Buddha Tooth Relic Temple from outside. This time we decided to step in to feel the ambience and boy, what a STUNNING impact the inside had on us! Bright colourful lanterns added to the sheer grandeur of the large square hall where the majestic Buddha stands in grand style. Being a monk, Buddha is usually portrayed in somber simple fashion. Not here though. Here he is grand in every respect. Richly adorned in golden ambience, there's a golden hue to the entire temple as one walks through it admiring Bodhisattvas in various forms holding different flowers, implements etc. Freshly chosen orchids in full bloom, in multiple colours adorn the temple in breathtaking bouquets which will leave you awestruck for their sheer grandeur! While at the temple don't miss a visit to the Meditation Room on Floor No 4 where the sheer power of the 'meditative energy' will literally blow you off your mind!! It is here that the 'Tooth Relic' is presented in grand fashion in an inner sanctum not accessible for the general public. Also do not miss a visit to the very top of the Temple where the ' Prayer Wheel' is housed in a separate pagoda style chamber. Here again the calm ambience shines through.
What caught my particular attention was that footwear was barred only in the Meditation Room on Floor No4 and not anywhere else. Possibly it was to present no barrier to entry of one & all. Truly a remarkable experience! Do visit when in Singapore next."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,If someone is going to China town then he must visit this temple. It is a beautiful temple but ladies have to wear sarongs if their shoulder or knees are visible.the sarongs are kept in the temple to wear free of cost. The temple is very beautiful and there is a museum on 3rd floor which has a fine collection of Buddhism
,,Nice temple,4.0,,"Very young by temple standards but very impressive design, staff is so so friendly They have the strange rule that females have to cover their shoulders, we have not seen this anywhere before"
,,Photographer's and Art Lovers Delight!,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic temple adds to the cultural flavour of China Town and is a two in one attraction, Temple as well as Museum. Spiritual place of visit for the followers of Buddhism. And for Art lovers it is quite a delightful place with a treasure trove of artefacts, idols, statues and a lovely red and gold shade all over the place reflected by soft lights and lamps. It is an interesting place and has a calming effect with a meditative music in the background.
The temple is in the 1st and 4th floor and stairs further lead you to a roof garden with lovely Orchids in bloom. The World's largest Vairocana Buddha prayer wheel is amidst this beautiful Buddha Orchid garden. The Museum on Level 2 & 3 neatly showcases various Heavenly Gods and Buddhas and many more.
For a Museum, the space is less, yet very well maintained and neatly showcased. A must visit for the photography enthusiasts!"
,,Well-maintained and nice museum,4.0,,You would love it if you are inclined to Buddhism. There is a museum on the 3rd floor which has a fine collection of Bodhisatvas!
,,another temple in China Town,3.0,,"I have been to this temple a few times now. Located in China town in the hustle and bustle of the place you tend to come across it all of a sudden while hunting for bargins in the many stalls.
The temple has a number of interesting features that are worth taking the time to examine. However, after traipsing through Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Brunei I must confess to being a bit over temples.
The Buddah tooth is worth the vist when you go to china town but if you have done temples do not make a special trip to this one. That is unless you are deeply into temples that allege to hold a tooth from Buddha."
,,Gold everywhere!,4.0,,"Nice little temple in Chinatown.Because this place is sacred if you come here wear decent clothes but they will provide something as cover up if you came wearing short sleeve shirt & shorts.
There are lots of different buddhas inside & you see people praying.Make sure to walk around quietly so as not to disturb the people praying.A must see to spend 30 minutes of your time in Chinatown."
,,Amazing sites to see,5.0,,This was a very educational place and is located right next to Chinatown with lots of shopping and plenty of places to eat. A must see area while visiting Singapore.
,,ok - pretty building,3.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is close to Chinatown, Sri Mariamman Temple and Maxwell Food Centre. Admissions is free. We peaked inside to see the service going on but did not stay long. The building is beautiful and I would say 1/2 hour is enough time to take photos and look inside."
,,Tour of the buddah tooth relic museum,4.0,,This was a marvellous place over 4 floors with an upper garden too. Thousands of buddah surround the main hall and there is a mezzanine so you can look down. The toilets were spotless and the place caters for disabled visitors with a stair lift to the roof terrace.
,,Awe-Inspiring!,4.0,,"This is a beautiful building - and one I was fortunate to witness during a Buddhist ceremony. For the ladies, be sure to bring a shawl to wrap around your shoulders (if they're bare). However, if you forget, you can borrow one at the temple."
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"Easily one of the best temples we've seen.

Set over several floors, we explored the ground floor first as there was a ceremony with singing, music and chanting going on.
Women advised to cover shoulders - pashminas were given at the entrance.
Beautifully decorated and every inch of the place has something to look at.

We were fortunate to see the place decorated for Chinese New Year. Fantastic photo opportunities.

The roof garden with the worship cylinder was peaceful and quiet. Easy to forget you're in the city centre up there.

There are several 'museum' floors which exhibits on the buddha history and the history on the temple itself. The chamber where the tooth is kept has prohibited photography. It is a stunning feast for the eyes with gold decorations and gifts around the room.

The temple is very active with monks and prayer-goers as well as tourists.

We combined this with lunch at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre, just around the corner. Also Sago street just next to the temple."
,,My second visit and I still enjoying as much as the first time!,5.0,,Place of worship and small piece of quiet and harmony inside Singapore. Take your time and remember to dress accordingly. I think it's a good idea to stop for few minutes at the entrance and soak the atmosphere before proceeding further.
,,The Shining Monastery!,5.0,,The inside is shining and awesomely decorated. It gives one of the most awesome feelings to be inside this temple with Buddhas looking at you from all sides. And the feeling is just awesome. Very peaceful in sharp contrast to the flea market I had just left behind. It's a must visit!
,,Closed!,3.0,,We went there on the day before the Lunar New Year and its closed. Very disappointed. There's a notice that says the temple will open on midnight til the Lunar New Year.
,,Beautiful and relaxing,4.0,,Beautiful and packed with history. I learnt quite a lot about Buddhism in here and the staffs were quite helpful to explain to me too. Each floor offers different kind of history so it's nice.
,,Amazing Temple,4.0,,It is such a beautiful temple. I loved all the bodhisattvas! I strongly recommend taking time out of your visit to Chinatown to see this beautiful place and be in awe.
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,So beautiful! Very interesting to see this culture up close and personal! Thoroughly enjoyed our visit here.
,,IF YOUR GOING TO VISIT A BUDDHA TEMPLE THIS IS THE PLACE,5.0,,"This is a wonderful temple but be warned it is extremely busy. Make sure that you go up to the different floor, because each floor offers something different and beautiful."
,,Beautiful example if Buddhist temple!,5.0,,"Gorgeous inside with tons of ""gold"" and over 100 VERY nice statues of Buddha. This is a genuine temple, so you will encounter many people praying. I liked the ""zodiac"" Buddha's with a statue and description for each of the 12 signs. Be sure to wear sone thing that covers your upper arms and knees. If you forget, they have ""aprons"" for wearing while in the temple."
,,"Artistic, Beautiful, and Zen",5.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum (新加坡佛牙寺龙华院) is a four-storey Buddhist Temple located in the Central district of Singapore. It was built based on the Tang Dynasty architectural style and also to house the tooth relic of the historical Buddha - claimed that it was found in 1980 in Myanmar.

From outside, you can see the grand building, like super huge temple, and it is! When you step inside, you can see every beautiful part of the temple. It's artistic, colorful, and very Zen. It gives you warmth and peace when you are inside the temple. It's also very clean and wide. You can take elevator to go to the Sacred Light Hall (Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic Chamber) on the top floor, which is the repository of the sacred Buddha tooth.

There are a lot of Buddha statues around the temple. There's also a beautiful garden located on the top floor. I suggest you to visit this place at least once even if you’re not Buddhist. It’s worth it to see around the place and enjoy the Zen vibe.

Around the temple, it’s already the Chinatown market which sells lots of cheap things, souvenirs, of some Chinese related stuffs.

Tips :
If you want to visit this place, for ladies I recommend to wear shirt / dress that can cover up your shoulder and also long skirt / pants. But if you wear sexy shirt like me last time also don’t worry because the temple provide a scarf to cover yourbody before you enter the temple."

Not many people know that there is a Dining Hall located at the basement of this temple, accessible from the sides of the temple or via the lift near the entrance.

There are always plenty of vegetarian eateries around Chinatown in Singapore, but this hidden gem serves good tasty vegetarian rice set @ S$3 only. Noodles are also available, simply love their Wanton Mee."

Take your time and walk all the way from front to back and head upstairs if you have time for a different perspective."
,,Singapore's kingdom of deities,4.0,,"The first time I visited this temple, I was awe-struck by its elaborate interiors and the images of deities there. I was there during Wesak Day and it was most befitting as it was also the day to celebrate the birth, enlightenment and passing of the Buddha. The entire shrine hall was decorated with much pomp and grandeur. I bathed the little buddha image then. Another noteworthy experience was the big bell at the topmost level. One could set himself in motion going round the bell, practising walking meditation. Although this temple is quite new, the entire design and images makes it like a century-old temple. It's serene, perfect for greater peace of mind."

The people are friendly and there are signs and guides to assist both in behaviour and providing historical notes. There is a lift to enable people to move between floors and experience all of the building. There are some amazing sights and historical items on open display. There is a rooftop garden and a quiet pray room. It was hard to fathom at the end such a place of peace and tranquillity existing alongside the brothels and joss houses as it did in earlier times. Once you finish here you can dive into the shopping and food along the street.
,,Ohhhmmm...,5.0,,"A relaxing, cultural gem in the heart of Chinatown. Space to meditate upstairs. Be sure to visit the rooftop garden. Spiritual balance to a our cosmopolitan holiday."

There are many Buddha statues in great details in the main altar room on the ground floor. Here you can offer prayers to Buddha by lighting joss sticks or candles, and give a donation if you wish to.

There is an exhibition on the history of Buddha throughout his enlightenment, and a special room where they place relics of different parts of his body. Very interesting but no photography allowed here.

There is a meditation hall on one of the floors, where you can sit in peace and meditate. It's a very peaceful feeling being in the hall even without meditating.

Don't miss the top floor, where they have a huge spinning bell where you can make wishes, I guess."

There are locals worshiping among the visitors, it was so peaceful I visited it everyday--as it was minutes from my hotel. Upstairs, from floors 3-5 are the museum, which provide an education on the life of the Buddha and the spread of Buddhism. The top floor, however, where the tooth is kept, I will not even try and describe, you must see it with your own eyes. If you go to to Singapore, you must visit it."
,,What a fantastic temple!,5.0,,"I was struck by the exquisite features and appearance of the temple on the outside and the exquisite beauty of the temple on the inside. It was so tidy and serene... so peaceful when you enter the temple. We took the lift to the different floors of the temple, where a museum is located, and the mysterious and reverential tooth is displayed. A must see temple.

The temple is located in Chinatown."

,,Modern museum,4.0,,"As with most things in Singapore, one doesn't get a very ancient feel from visiting this museum because of its rather systematic and modern presentation; things here are beautifully presented across all floors. The congregation of various monks during prayer hour was a site to watch; maroon robes, music et al. Descriptions are also helpful to get the context."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,What a magnificent building the architecture and workmanship truly takes your breath away. We were lucky enough to visit whilst a service was in progress. Very spiritual and touching. Wonderful.

,,great that the temple has an instructive museum,4.0,,I think the closest MRT station is Chinatown and from there there is a nice walk . On the ground floor is the temple hall itself and there the monks are delivering service for the believers. From one floor to another you may take a lift. Not to miss the roof garden with its mantras rotating cylinder. The entrance is free overall.

,,very nice temple over 6 floors,5.0,,"I have been to this temple on multiple occasions: it is a really pretty temple, and the best temple during the hungry ghost festival. What I had not realised was that you can visit all the upstairs levels: there is the mezzanine walkway going around the main temple space, the shrine that holds the temple tooth it is named after, a museum with presents given to the temple, and a huge praying wheel in the middle of a well maintained garden on the roof top of the temple. Entrance is free (decent dress code), but the upstairs areas close at 6 pm- come in time if you want to visit the whole temple."
,,cool visit,3.0,,"One of the biggest here in singapore. Open to public and very welcoming. The only restriction is that you cant wear short skirts or shorts. They do provide pieces of fabric that you can cover yourself with.

tip 1 : try and go at 6pm on weekdays when they hold prayers.
tip 2 : go up to 2nd storey via the elevator just outside the prayer hall. from there you can view the prayer hall from a higher perspective
tip 3 : they have a museum on that level too.
tip 4 : you can also go all the way to the roof to visit their prayer garden."
,,"Beautiful, colorful and peaceful temple...",5.0,,"...other than the many tourists (including us!) who were walking through the temple taking pictures. Most tourists were respectful, quiet and many were praying at the temple. It is gorgeous inside and out, and is filled with exquisite sculptures, small and large. It's location near Temple and Mosque streets was also convenient, as we could explore many of Singapore's cultures adjacent to each other. Not to be missed!"
,,Nice red temple,4.0,,"of Buddha and other insight of Buddha,, the location is easy to find, in the heart of China Town. Nearby the temple, you can find the Maxwell Food Centre, the famous food court beside the Lau Pa Sat."
,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a four-storey Buddhist temple and museum complex,5.0,,".............. that rises up at the heart of the Chinatown district in Singapore. The temple is based on the Tang dynasty architectural style and built to house the tooth relic of the historical Buddha, which is claimed that was found in 1980 in a collapsed stupa in Myanmar.
From outside the temple is grand, inside it is richly ornate and colorful, but the most significant feature of the temple is the two-meter tall solid gold stupa that weighs 420 kg located at the top floor, in the Sacred Light Hall. It is the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic Chamber, which is the repository of the sacred Buddha tooth.
Only the monks have access to the inner chamber. However visitors are able to observe it from the viewing gallery twice a day, at 9:00 am to 12:00 noon and again at 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm, during the ceremonies conducted by the monks.

,,Excelkent,5.0,,"Visited one morning with kids and elderly father. Access is good and the temple is astonishing and very moving, whatever your beliefs.

It is a holy temple, not a tourist attraction and therefore not especially engaging for small children but the staff are very friendly and I would still highly recommend to learn more about the country you are visiting.

One thing to watch is the dress code, especially for women, although they do provide wraps to help people cover up."

,,One of Chinatown's centrpieces.,4.0,,"Speak to an elderly, knowledgeable local and he/she may be able to share the somewhat morbid history of Sago Street, adjacent to this landmark.

,,Great visit even for a local,5.0,,"I finally visited this temple after hearing so much about it from foreigners.
On the ground floor is the prayer room with the large statue of Buddha. Taking the elevator to the fourth floor, we visited the serene room( opened from 9 am to 6 pm) to see the Buddha tooth relic. It is a beautiful room for one to enjoy. Then we climb two flight of steps to the roof garden with the very big prayer wheel and ten thousand Buddhas. There is a peaceful garden here for one to sit in contemplation. After that we visited the museum on the third floor. There is much to read and learn here.
Finally we took the elevator to B1 where there is a clean quiet cafe selling vegetarian food and dessert at low cost. Clean toilet facilities can be found here too. There is a guided tour in English at 2 pm on Saturaday."
,,Many Levels,4.0,,This Museum has many levels and is worth taking at look at. Easy to find. I struggled to see the tooth as it was small and not close to glass however there was a TV monitor zoomed in on it.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a beautiful house of worship. Open to the public, even during services, you can marvel at the intricately carved states and delicate embroidery on the wall coverings.

I have been to a few Buddhist temples (mainly in Thailand) but this one is very impressive. 4 or 5 floors of a lot of historical artefacts and some stunning art and sculptures. Definitely worth the trip for something different and some inner reflection.

The giant prayer wheel on the roof is very impressive."
,,Amazing highlight for your Singapore trip,5.0,,"I would highly recommend visiting the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum - besides being a spiritual place where you can immerse in the atmosphere of the chimes and prayers, you should also visit the museum on third level of the temple.

If you have the time, don't hesitate to visit both the Museum on the third floor where are displayed the sacred Relics of the Buddha.

I would also recommend visiting the roof garden with Ten Thousand Buddhas Pavillion, housing the large Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel, in the center - you will love the orchid garden there and the tranquillity of the pavillion.

The admission is free and you can access the Temple every day from Mon to Sun 7:00am - 7:00pm.

There are 1½ – 2 hrs long guided tours of the Temple every Saturday / English – 2pm, Mandarin – 2.30pm/."

,,fascinating,5.0,,we just started the chinatown tour with this temple which has wonderful exterior view with its storey roofs but deefinitely the interior is much more better than the exterior view.definitely worth to see
,,This Temple Stands Out as a Singapore Landmark in Chinatown,5.0,,"You don't want to miss going inside. Take the time to go to the 4th floor to see the ""tooth relic."" Also go up one floor to the orchid garden where there is a huge prayer wheel, and lovely garden area."

,,Very nice,5.0,,A must visit place in Chinatown and very relaxing despite the crowd here. you cannot miss this temple if you are walking in Chinatown market.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Couldn't go past this place as part of our Chinatown tour in Singapore. Very ornate the generosity of the monks and the volunteer guides was impressive.
,,So colourful and fun!,5.0,,"This is really worth visiting. Even my young children loved this, although my 5 year old was little disappointed as he could'n see the tooth very well.

This is colourful and there is plenty to see. Prayer wheel on the top is really something different! The athmosphere at down was quite restless but on the top it was totally peaceful. What a wonderful contrast!"
,,S,5.0,,"tuning ist up the road from our hotel and as usual enter Chinatown is thesis beatiful building, we went inside and appreciated the structure, elegance of this wonderful building, we was very respectful as it is very busy with the locals praying."
,,Mind blowing,4.0,,"I had heard of the museum but didn't know anything about it or where it was. The name had never enticed me so I wasn't particularly interested. Now I understand the name. After spending some very hot hours perusing and shopping in Chinatown, I happened upon it by chance. All I saw was this amazing, imposing building, went up to it and realised what it was. We went in and spent the next few hours drooling over the contents of the museum. Suffice to say there are some pretty amazing artefacts, furniture, all sorts of stuff. What floored me though was the level where the tooth is kept, behind a large viewing window. So much gold!!! It's pretty over the top. Despite how interesting and beautiful everything was, it just left me with a bit of a hollow feeling about the wealth contained in that one room. I spent a month in Malaysia and visited many temples and places of worship and they all contain amazing altars and rich furnishings, but this was something else. I can't say that I'm completely knowledgable about Buddhism, and I know the Buddhas tooth is a very sacred thing, but the opulence didn't fit my overall belief of how Buddhists view wealth and ostentatiousness. Maybe my beliefs aren't accurate, I know that churches and other places of worship display wealth and grandeur, but it shocked me nevertheless. I probably would have given the museum 5 but for that lasting feeling of discomfort. I'm sure I'll get over it. Anyway, definitely worth a visit, it is a beautiful building, the exhibits are magnificent and it's a nice place to get out of the heat for a while. I am totally in love with Chinese antiques and architecture so this visit gave me plenty to admire. Didn't go to the garden unfortunately."
,,"Worth seeing, but expect it to be a bit busy",4.0,,"Inside is really beautiful, particularly downstairs. My only minor complaint would be that it almost felt overpacked and a lot of people did not observe the 'silence' policy expected at a number of temples."
,,nice to see,4.0,,found this temple near china town and went inside there was monks chanting and it was amazing well worth the trip inside
,,"Marvelous, Historical, Excellent",4.0,,"Got to learn lot of things. Great and real like statues, marvelous carvings, great exhibits. Get a peace of mind. Get a selfie and groupie outside the temple."
,,"One of the most beautiful, ornate temples around",5.0,,"Unlike most Buddhist temples which are hundreds of years old, this temple is relatively new in its construction and design, and it benefits from modern technology, while drawing on the beauty and design of ancient scriptures. There are multiple levels of worship and you could literally spend hours here. The artifacts on the museum floor were fascinating in their historical significance, and the floor where the Buddha tooth relic is kept and revered is awe-inspiring. Even the rooftop is breathtaking with the largest prayer wheel in the world sitting in the middle."
,,Luxurious Buddha temple!,5.0,,"Such a beautiful temple.
U must try it before u leave singapore otherwise u just miss the chance!
First floor is the best all the walls are filled by Buddha's statues tland it is something!

You can do some religious ritual if you believe in it
Second floor has lots of object to see
But first is the best!!!"

To me it looks kinda like temples found in Japan. A place of peace as well for those who seek for some rest in mind. However, mind your clothes when coming here because they wouldn't let you in if you're wearing improper clothes for a religious place."
,,Full of art pieces in there,5.0,,It is definitely the place you don't want to miss in China Town of Singapore. Full of Buddhism art pieces from the 1st to the 4th floor.

,,"""The Buddah to Come ...""",4.0,,"The alleged relic of the Buddha (reminiscent of saints' bones in European cathederals) is impressive but even more interesting is the image of the ""the Buddha to come."" Not being Buddhist, I know little of theology but the attendant explained at the end of the current 100,000-year-cycle, a new Buddha will come to take the place of the current one. Beautiful image ..."
,,Beautiful new temple,5.0,,Located right on the edge of Chinatown this temple is quite easy to find and a must visit for everyone who comes to Singapore.

,,Go to a real temple,1.0,,"This temple is not real for me so I would suggest that you go to a real temple, like the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple at Bencoolen Link. In our quest to see places of interests, we should aim for authenticity."
,,Something different,4.0,,"Located at the Chinatown, this tempel has a very strict rule on dress code (no mini skirts and shorts), but they provide tourists with some garments to protect body parts. Top floor is a garden and huge bell for prayer. Each floor has a theme. One floor consists of the golden heavenly setting where Buddha reigned. A lot of bling bling. Must see!"
,,Interesting place.,5.0,,We loved this place it was easy to find and fully of interesting exhibits. The roof garden at the top was so quiet you would never think of all the hustle and bustle going on below. The tooth relic room was stunning.

,,Visually Stunning Display - A Must Visit While in Singapore,5.0,,"This temple-cum-museum located in Chinatown of Singapore is definitely worth a visit.

Parts of the structure are designed as museum and parts are designed for devotees.

Though the structure looks small from the outside, one can spend a huge amount of time looking at different statues and other artifacts related to the Buddha and Buddhism.

The artifacts are different parts of the world, in different styles and spread across multiple floors. They are wonderfully arranged and labeled with appropriate lighting.

One can click photos in most places, however in some rooms, photography is not allowed.

There is a canteen / dining place in the lower floors. The food is 100% vegetarian though some dishes are made to look like fish and meat :-). I enjoyed the food here."
,,Breathtaking Temple,5.0,,"It truly is a beautiful temple, very informative with many levels to explore, we loved the little hidden roof top garden.
It also used to have a lovely little coffee shop in between the souvenir section on one of the upper floors which was like a little oasis, however sadly realised in June that it no longer exists, instead it has a canteen in the basement now where you could grab a very inexpensive meal.
Naturally your shoulders and legs have to be covered up while walking through the temple so if you don't want to use one of the ""aprons"" from the temple dress appropriately."

Notice the two buddhas out front and look at their mouths...one open and one closed giving rise to the sounds made....Ohh for the open mouthed.

,,A beautiful temple and informative museum,5.0,,"I visited early in the morning and a service was in progress, which added an ambiance to my visit. The temple itself is beautiful with deep red and gold colours, and a tranquil rooftop garden. The museum opens at 9 am and is full of Buddha statues, interesting information about history and religion and 'relics' of the organs of the original Buddha. It is definitely worth a visit but allow at least an hour/90 minutes to see it all."

There was a service going on, which added to the atmosphere. Several floors, crammed with ancient Chinese artifacts & the tooth relic is there in all its glory on the top floor, amid much gold. Nicely air conditioned, which brings relief from the heat & humidity of Singapore. Entry is free; shawls available for women to cover their shoulders."

- Please wear modestly before entering religious sites like this."
,,Nice Temple,4.0,,If time permit one should visit this temple. This temple is located in the city It is very old temple and famous among tourist.
,,"Fantastic Piece Of History, Religion and Culture",5.0,,"I'm not a religious person but I do find churches, temples, and mosques, etc very fascinating. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is the best of these in Singapore - the Temple is beautiful and its lovely when a service is on to hear the voices joined together. There is plenty to look at and then just when you think you've seen it all, there are another 3 floors housing various other parts of the temple and a huge museum. Look out for the very realistic waxworks of previous priests! Our favourite bit though had to be the shrine to the Buddha tooth itself - a room of gold hidden behind glass. You walk through a meditation chamber to look through the window. We were even blessed by a Buddhist monk in this room - a very wonderful experience.
If you visit one temple in Singapore make sure it is this one!"
,,Unexpected gem,5.0,,"We went in expecting to enjoy a lovely temple and it was beautiful. In fact, it's truly spectacular. What was unexpected were the three other floors that housed a huge prayer wheel, golden temple with the tooth, and a floor dedicated to the story of the Buddha with artifacts."

,,A very beautiful Tang style Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"I go to this temple each time I'm in Singapore. It is a very wonderful experience with so much to see.

There is prayer hall in the 1st floor which will glitter like a gigantic gold. And there are museums in the second and third floor, in which one can see the historic idols collected from India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal and many more countries. And the tooth relic temple is at the 4th floor, where Buddha's tooth relic is preserved in a gigantic golden stupa. This tooth was discovered by a monk inside a abandoned stupa in Myanmar. In 1980s, he brought that to singapore and this temple was built to worship Buddha and preserving the relic.
Photography is not allowed inside the 4th floor, apart from this you can photograph the beauty of the temple elsewhere."

,,A glimpse of Buddhism in Southe Eats Asia,5.0,,As a buddhist this is not exactly the temple type place where you would encounter in south asia. But still it has lot of things to see. Specially lot of relics. If you are first comer you will be misguided imagining that only the ground floor is there. But more interesting things to see are on the top floors.

,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"As a Buddhist I would recommend this as a must-visit place in Singapore. During my visit, it was time for monks to pray. Note that short skirts and pants are not allowed in the temple. However, they do provide cloth at the entrance so that you can just wrap it to cover up. It has museum, place for meditation, wax model of monks that took care of the temple before, and a small orchid garden on top of the temple. Cameras are not allowed in this temple as well."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,Worth a visit as it is very ornate and well kept. Enjoyable if you have a little spare time on your hands and you want to meditate. Historically it is worth a visit.

,,Beautiful Temple but commercial rip off as well,3.0,,There is no denying that this is a beautiful temple to see. Amazing inside and out. But everything in there is for sale which makes it all a bit shallow. The temple runs on donations so you can buy every piece of it to sponsor the upkeep. Nice to see if you pass by but wouldn't go out of my way to visit.
,,Interesting place,3.0,,"Beautiful architecture design. Entry is free. Full of historical sight. Although so many people and quite noisy when I visit, it's still a pleasant place."

The main sanctuary is impressive and surrounded by hundreds of Buddhas. The room next to it has beautiful textile wallpaper and statues for each character of the Chines Zodiaca. The tooth relic is upstairs in another quiet room, we here visitors are welcom to meditate and view the ornate shrine containing the tooth. Don forget to leave time to go up to the roof garden! You'll be glad you did!

Just across the street is the Maxwell Road Food Centre (hawker centre), which is a great place to stop for a meal or snack."
,,Stunning yet peaceful Temple!,5.0,,"What a gorgeous temple! No words to describe it! A must visit in Chinatown. I went there around late afternoon and they had an amazing prayer session too which was so beautiful.
Located opposite Chinatown complex,surrounded by several shops so its easy to locate.
Nearest MRT - Chinatown (around 20 mins walking)"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,The temple is a working temple and quite beautiful. We were lucky enough to be there when the monks were chanting. Do go upstairs to the museums but the real highlight is the roof garden.

,,Chinese Style,4.0,,It is located at China town. A lot of images of Buddha are here. And the top of temple has a little garden and wishing bell waiting to see you.
,,Local buddhist temple with gold and artistic design.,4.0,,There are many buddha statues in this temple (different buddhas) and sometimes you can see monks chanting too. You must wear appropriate clothes (not too short or revealing) to enter the temple or they will lend you a big piece of cloth to cover yourself. You also need to be quiet at all times. The top level is a garden and is quite unique to see. Dont forget to see the buddha tooth relic (cant remember which floor) but it has lots of gold-piece around it so pretty easy to spot.
,,Adored it!!,5.0,,"Although Orthodox Christian, I really adored this temple and the atmosphere it emits. Located in Chinatown is a definite-must-see!!!"
,,Informative and Beautiful Temple,5.0,,"If you are interested to learn basic knowledge about Buddhism, this is the place to be. The life story of Buddha was featured and presented in a simple child-like story which makes me as visitor be interested for more stories about his life. There is also a place to meditate for those practicing Buddhists. A nice place to go and visit when in Singapore. Nearby is a long street with various Singaporean/Indian/Chinese food treats be it vegetarian or not. There are also a lot of souvenir shops to choose from.My tip, go early. They open at 7am. I went there around opening time and the place is indeed serene. By the time I got out at 9, there are a lot of people already and the ceremony at the"
,,Interesting if you have the proper tour guide,3.0,,"This temple is located just outside a very good Chinese Hawker center. We visited with our tour guide, who was able to explain many of the cultural aspects of the temple. This made the visit much more enjoyable than if we had visited on our own."
,,"it is a pleasant respite from the crowd, souvenir stalls, overpriced food and beverages that is Chinatown.",4.0,,"Absolutely take your time in this attraction. There are many things to look and learn. If nothing else, it is a pleasant respite from the crowd, souvenir stalls, overpriced food and beverages that is Chinatown. You must visit."

,,Incredibly Impressive and Fascinating Museum Upstairs,5.0,,"The main temple itself is beautiful and you can walk around the ground floor and make a donation. The rest of the temple is definitely worth visiting.

,,Splendide and worth to do if you like Buddhism and temples,5.0,,"As a spiritual person with a Buddhist philosophy, I was amazed by the location. There are few Buddhas status with their meanings. There are different levels (I didn't have time to do) I went directly to the 4th floor where the tooth is. The room is beautiful, you can medidate there. To me it was very powerful!
It's free but donations are to support the community and maintain the temple."
,,Hidden Gem,4.0,,"Great place to explore and learn about Buddhism, not just a museum, if you are lucky it will be prayer time. Majestic main hall and four floors of relics and information. Added bonus it is cool and peaceful inside. Ladies just make sure your shoulders are covered. (but don't worry there are shawls available). But the best part is it is FREE !
Also next door is Sago Street Market a quieter tourist market than Pagoda street."
,,Oh waow,5.0,,I was presently surprised when I visited this place .. The main hall was breathtaking .. There was some prayers going on and it was so peaceful to listen ..the museum on the floors above was super ...definitely recommend

Very interesting insights into the Buddhist religion although I was surprised to find there were a number of branches/sects."
,,"A living, breathing Buddhist temple in a bustling area",5.0,,"Gorgeous temple to visit, real people living and chanting inside en masse, led by monks apparently oblivious to the tourist lenses upon them. The sound was mesmerising and the Buddhist statues glow. It feels like a loved place. You can just step inside (appropriately dressed) and be transported away from the bustle of the Chinatown streets."
,,Not sure it is real tooth of buddha,5.0,,nice museum with alot of gold in the top chamber. more interesting is the museum on the 3rd floor i think. they have some ghandara art pieces first buddha statues made in afghanistan influenced by the greek. early buddhism had no statue or images of lord buddha
,,Great looking temple,4.0,,A quite big temple that looks absolutely stunning! Seams likes its been renovated as well. Well worth a visit!

,,"Great area, good temple",3.0,,"The temple is good. The architecture and the inner sculptures are good. Soothing atmosphere. The best thing is the area in ehich this temple is situated. It's a happening area, especially if u r a chinese. Many souvenir shops around and overall good stuff.

Can spend 1 hour here, not more than that for me."
,,Its Okay,3.0,,"A cute place to visit. Its located in China Town, cute little drop by. Not allowed to enter with shorts, but you can hire a cloth to cover your legs. So tourists take note.

Was okay, not bad, but nothing like the temples found in Thailand. Still a nice drop by for a more relaxing and calming retreat from the busy roads of China Town.

Accessible by MRT."
,,Beautiful temple in the bustle of a busy city,5.0,,"Everything is well maintained in here. Its air conditioned as well.

Be aware that all the exhibits in the temple prohibits picture taking and loud noise. If you're wearing sleeveless clothing and short skirts or pants, you're required to wear a sarong and a scarf around your body. It is provided for free at the entrance of the temple."
,,calming,4.0,,easy to find and well worth a visit. as it is a temple where people go at all times for prayers it is respectful to not constantly take pictures - which some visitors didn't respect when we visited. The place oozes calm and charm in how well it is looked after.
,,Good Place to Visit... Heavenly,4.0,,Just drop down at China Town MRT and a 10 min walk to the temple. Awesome designs and a heavenly presences and if your lucky you could also experience the prayer
,,No better Buddhist place than this in Singapore :),5.0,,"The first floor of this four-story red-and-white building is just ""gold-glittered"" with three big golden statues on the stage, golden frames and smaller golden Buddhas (maybe not all of them golden) on both sides of the big room, and golden lantern-like lights (my personal favorite thing to see here!) on the ceiling at the back area; on the three floors above is a museum with various sculptures & artifacts of Buddhism (there's a stone slab with Buddha's footprints on them on one of those higher floors); and finally, on the rooftop above the fourth floor is a garden with a big red 'prayer wheel' and 10,000 Buddhas (yes, LITERALLY that many of the tiny figures in glass cases along the corridors around the garden) and which also has some bamboo plants with interesting red stems. Overall, this is a great temple/museum combination definitely worth checking out while in Singapore whether you're a Buddhist or not and where you might actually learn some things about the religion (on one of the museum floors, there's like a ""narration"" by Buddha himself of his beginning and the origin of the religion and such written on the info plates, and also either on the third or fourth floor, there's a meditation area for people on stages set up along the walls).

There are buses that can drop you off pretty much right in front of the temple on South Bridge Rd. (on the other side of the road from the temple), but a fun way to get here is to take the MRT to Chinatown station (blue & purple lines) and walk through Chinatown where you'll come across interesting sights like ""Food Street"" (an area under a high glass ceiling with quaint, old-styled buildings below) and numerous make-shift hawkers (I got a keychain set with souvenir keychains depicting great landmarks of Singapore like the SkyPark, 'the Durian' & the Merlion from one of those streetside hawkers at a very good bargain price!); it's only about a 10-to-15-minute walk from the MRT to the Temple or vice versa."
,,A serene spot in the middle of the city,4.0,,This is a very nice place to get away from the bustle of the city. I happened by during a ceremony and was able to spend some time relaxing there.
,,"Nice temple, museum wasn't to neutral.",4.0,,I like budhist temples and the culture. This temple is very vivid seen they do sessions you can just watch. The details on this temple inside are nice. The museum shows nice art from around different buddhist countries however the guiding text didn't really feel neutral at all times... It's a good way to learn about the start of budhism though.
,,Colorful and peaceful,5.0,,The Buddha tooth relic temple is a calm oasis in the middle of Chinatown. Make sure you go up to the top to check out the Orchid garden and the giant prayer roll. Sit a while and relax on the rooftop garden. The museum is also worth a look with collections from all over the world and Buddha's story beautifully depicted.
,,Surprisingly good,5.0,,"I'm thinking, yet another temple, but it was beautiful and there were 5 floors of things to see. If you are in Chinatown, you should stop in."

,,Beautiful Buddhist temple,5.0,,A beautiful temple set amidst the old and new houses and building in the hustle and bustle of Singapore China town. A solemn place to visit. Visitors need to be properly attired.
,,Must-See,4.0,,"If you're at all interested in the teachings of Buddha, Chinese architecture, or simply a meditative spot to pause, this is a must-see in Singapore. Be aware that clothing is must cover shoulders and knees (wraps are available for visitors wearing no sleeves or mini-skirts, but who wants to wear what hundreds of other visitors have put on?) The temple itself is beautiful and the four levels have unique features to be explored. Don't miss the rooftop garden - so tranquil - that contains a giant prayer wheel. Be aware the temple closes relatively early - on the day I visited the hours posted showed it should've been open until 7 p.m., but the lights went off and they told everyone it was closing at 6 p.m. Also, the elevators were extremely slow, so if you can't/don't do stairs, try to visit at non-peak times so you don't wait so long to visit different floors."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Probably the most impressive Buddha temple in Singapore! The place is very nice, it is very worth to spend 2 hours there."
,,Organised!,5.0,,"This Buddhist temple is place kept clean and tidy. You can go to different floors. Visit the museum, have a look at the tooth relic. Keep sufficient time for visiting the temple. We had to return without visiting some of the museum as they were closing. We may require 4-5 hours!"
,,different place showing religion,4.0,,great place to get to know about the Buddhist religion. lots of things have to keep in mind though. no shorts. certain areas you are not allowed to wear footwear.
,,Great Photo Op,5.0,,"Very interesting temple, with very bright colors (red and gold) and plenty of fascinating Buddhas. Won't see this in many places!"
,,My first Buddhist Temple Experience,5.0,,"We accidentally visit this place as we explore the cheap shops around the area. Lucky to be able to visit the place. The inside is amazing! I've only seen this kind of temples in movie and actually seeing it is just WOW!

The place is tourist friendly but the solemn atmosphere inside remains."
,,very solemn and quiet place,4.0,,If you are wearing shorts or sleeveless (women) you would be asked to wear their cloth cover. The temple/museum was a little bit creepy but its a solemn & quiet place for Buddhists.
,,Spiritual oasis in the bustle of Chinatown,4.0,,"Great temple to visit to pay your respects, or to simply witness others doing the same. Maybe I should have taken a tour, I have so many questions after visiting. What do all the numbers mean? If you are wearing a hat, make sure you take it off before stepping inside, which also means brush your hair before leaving the house or hotel."
,,Great cultural place. Remember it closes at 6,5.0,,"Firstly, it doesnt open late. So go early in the afternoon.

It is near a couple of great eating places
Smith Street (China town eating street)
Chinatown hawker (2nd floor)
Maxwell market, just across the road
Other eateries like great wall and yuppies eating places along tanjong pagar stretch

Dont forget the rooftop garden with its fake rocks speakers and the back of the temple"
,,Nice Buddhist temple,3.0,,This by all means a nice Buddhist temple but not overly impressive. The architecture is nice and so is the decoration in the temple as such. It is located in Chinatown and should be part of the tour of this area.
,,interesting place to see,5.0,,Staff helpful easy place to go to and see right in china town next to MRT and shops clean and friendly
,,Rewarding experience,5.0,,"We took a free guided walking tour of Chinatown which was one of the best things we did. We travelled with two pre teen children and it was great to get some history and perspective of life in Singapore. Our tour guide Bernard was fantastic, passionate and very knowledgeable. He was born and bred in Singapore and gave a real life account of what it was like to grow up in Singapore. It was great for our children to see and experience a different culture. We were fortunate enough to visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple which was truly magical. The ornate detail in temple was mind blowing and had I not been on the walking tour, would probably not have ventured inside for fear of disrespect. However Bernard was able to explain the cultures and religion which allowed us to experience this wonderful temple. Bernard also took us to stores which sold traditional Chinese medicines and herbs, incense and offerings, and we were able to experience the food hawkers stalls. If I only had limited time in Singapore, this is one walking tour that should not be missed. Bernard also has a walking tour in Little India (which we did not take) but I wish we had. A small tip at the end is well deserved and this is well worth the experience. Tour is approximately 2.5 hours in length but can be managed by any person as it is not fast paced with plenty of rest along the way."
,,Peaceful setting,4.0,,"Very nice temple with lots of images and paintings to see. No shorts or t-shirts allowed, but there are long cloak available to cover. Go during any of the religious ceremonies, the chant of the monks will bring you inner peace, whatever are your beliefs."
,,"Beautiful, interesting and informative",4.0,,"I found my visit to their small museum very informative about Buddha. So if you are curious in this regard, be sure to visit the museum and not just the main hall which is very stunning!! If you would like to have some quiet time, there is also a floor where you can meditate or just sit down and be quiet and look out the window. This visit made an impression on me."
,,"Beautiful building, but...",4.0,,"...it was closed due to renovations, so myself, a bunch of tourists and even a school trip missed out on the opportunity to go inside the temple when I visited in August."
,,This museum/temple gives insight into Buddhism,5.0,,"By visiting this museum, you get an understanding of the focus of the leaders who lead Buddhists in the region, as well as observe those who are worshiping there. Staff is friendly and answers questions. Visitors are welcomed and only asked to remove shoes in the upstairs worship area. Photos are permitted without charge. (We avoid photographing worshipers, however)"
,,Amazing temple,4.0,,"Situated among the scruffiness of Chinatown, this Buddhist temple is a jewel of cleanliness and neon lighting. Despite the garish deco, one gets a sense of peace and calm with a large hall where people are sitting and chanting. Worth a visit."
,,A Must-See for Tourists Visiting Singapore's Chinatown !,5.0,,"The Buddhist Temple Architecture is just unique and splendid - a perfect fusion of the ancient Chinese Great Tang Dynasty Buddhist temples and its original resources from India !

As the saying goes : Once you have seen this marvelous Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, you don't have to cover other Buddhist attractions outside the Metropolis in Singapore ...

Further, the unique Buddhist religious and cultural artefact is something one could hardly come across anywhere in this mundane world..."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Never in my life have I entered a buddhist temple so this was an interesting experience. I believe in God and I'm a Christian so the Buddhism belief system would never truly appeal to me. I do wish I was given a guided tour so I can ask questions. It's located in Chinatown (10 minute walk from the apartment I was staying at) and was curious to check it out. It's next to Chinatown Visitors Centre, souvenir shops, and Chinatown food street. When you enter in, your shoulders should not be exposed (they provide scarves if needed). Walked around the 1st floor. There were gods everywhere. Different Buddhas. Very colorful, lots of decorations, and gifts for the gods. There were descriptions of each god. I also saw people kneeling down to pray in a particular area. Took lots of pictures! Nice on the outside."
,,A modern version of a Buddhist temple,3.0,,"This temple is situated in Chinatown area surrounded by shops, stalls and great food in Smith Street. The temple itself is moderate in size with hundreds of tiny statutes. Women with sleeveless tops are provided with a shawl. The whole area is worth a visit. There are many souvenir stalls and a great variety of food in Smith Street, a few minutes from the temple. For local food at food court, visit the HDB flats at the back of the temple next to the performing stage. It is located on the first floor while the wet market where the locals do their food purchase is on the lower ground floor."
,,With history,5.0,,A great Temple with history and educational. It attracts loans of visitors from all over the world. Located in China town.
,,good place,4.0,,"Many special gods you can see . very nice decoration near Chinatown , you need take a train to Chinatown mrt"
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"This Buddha Temple is beautiful. Really enjoyed going inside and having a look around. Lovely things to see inside. Be respectful, and there are free shawls available to cover up if your clothing is not appropriate to enter (eg. Shoulders showing). Free and worth a visit."
,,Worth seeking out,4.0,,"We were approached by one of the volunteer guides who proudly took us around this impressive temple. Make sure you see the top floors and get blessed by one of monks.
Only negative was that at the end of the tour our guide lead us to a jewellery store in Chinatown where pressure salesmen weave their trade."
,,A new temple but worth a stop,4.0,,"While newly constructed, the museum inside provides a great introduction to Buddhism through displays of artifacts from all parts of Asia. And as a bonus you can see Buddha's tooth (if you believe in that sort of thing). It's free of charge and great to combine with a visit to Chinatown."
,,Very Beautiful and peaceful temple,5.0,,"In this temple, the decoration and design is very nice and make me feel calm. Each floors, has antiquities and religious stories. Recommend this place"
,,amazing tranquil place,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum complex located in the Chinatown across from Maxwell Food Centre. The Temple is 6 floors and on the top is open-air roof garden The best is everything is FREE and you can take as many photos as you want!
,,Enjoyed it,5.0,,"Great fun musuem to go in and experience, it is free of charge and cameras are allowed so it was great"
,,Beautiful Temple with plenty of Bling Bling,5.0,,"On par with the one in Kandy, Sri Lanka, this place is more gilded and modern. It costed millions of dollars. The place is well maintained and you can pray on the top floor. Free vegetarian food is provided in the basement. Chinatown is just nearby."
,,Don't miss it,4.0,,"Colors, Aromas, Faith, Contrast, a very spiritual place that is so worth it. the main altar is so impresive that you have to see it for your self. Be very resptecful"
,,the big prayer wheel on the rooftop,5.0,,"Gorgeous wheel and powerful too, get acquaintance with 10,000 Buddhas by going round it. It will be good for your present life and after lifes."
,,Buddhist Temple,4.0,,It's my first time to enter a temple where a ceremony was ongoing and I found this quite an experience. The design of the temple and the decorations plus the tour guide's information helped me understand the meaning of the statues that I saw. English translations of information were of great help.
,,Both the temple and the museum are interesting,5.0,,Interesting temple and museum. Worth a stop. Main floor temple is very accessible and the upper floors are accessible by both stairs and an elevator.
,,Clean temple,5.0,,"The buddha tooth temple is very clean. They have a giant bell where you can go around it. When i came in,i saw many small buddhas every where! I bet that there where hundreds of small buddhas!"
,,Lucky accident we came upon this place.,4.0,,"Loved our visit here. It happened by accident and we thoroughly enjoyed the visit, The museum upstairs is must see. Very informative."
,,Nice temple :),5.0,,"I liked the place for the beautiful statues. However, some aspects can be a little commercialized. Common sense to tourist to please dress decently when visiting a place of worship. However, for those ditzy tourist, they do loan you shawls to cover up before you enter as well."
,,You can leave your shoes on ...,4.0,,Beautiful 4 story pagoda with active service while tourist mull around silently. Tons of different Buddha figurines around bigger ones. Very beautiful. Optional aprons / wrap around skirts for non-ideal dressed tourists is a big plus.
,,Impressive temple and museum,4.0,,"5 min walking distancr from chinatown mrt, this temple is free and can access all 4 storey of temple including the roof."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The array of Buddhist statues and ornamentation in the first room is very attractive. Each Buddha is slightly different and there are hundreds of them.

The Dragon sculpture that adorns the wall above the Buddhas and give the room it's name 'Thousand Dragons' is amazing.

The main altar of the golden statues is the focal point of room.

The second room also has an impressive altar piece and statues representing each of the animals in the Chinese zodiac.

I may have been mistaken in some of the terms that I used, but I mean no offense to any Buddhists. I really enjoyed my visit."
,,Enjoy,5.0,,"I love this! When I explore a new country and city, I would like to pay a visit to the Temple or Pagoda in that region, and this is a wonderful Pagoda."
,,A suprise in China Town,5.0,,I was pleasantly surprised when I entered this Temple. The colours where breathtaking as was all the items on display. A must see when in Singapore visiting China Town
,,Peaceful and spiritual place,5.0,,"When we visited this temple for the second time, it was packed with people as they have a festival or celebration. But they still allow us to look around."
,,Lovely place,4.0,,"This is in Chinatown on the main road itself. I have been to many Buddhist temples hence no novelty for me but this is a impressive place since it is big. Ground floor has the traditional temple with thousands of statues. Next up is the Buddha tooth relic temple which is were many people meditate.
Then upstairs is the roof top garden which is wow! Lovely garden with a huge revolving bell.
We have to remove our shoes outside like in any temple and also dress modestly."
,,Very interesting Museum,5.0,,Large Buddhist temple which contains one of the Buddha's teeth (or at least claims too) in a massive shrine on the 3rd floor. Downstairs there is a more traditional temple. You need to be modestly dressed and remove your shoes to enter (there is a lift to 3rd floor). Be sure to visit the roof garden complete with massive bell which you can rotate.
,,First Buddhist temple,3.0,,"This is the first time I have visited a Buddhist temple and the opulence was very impressive. I was there at noon so there were monks and ordinary people chanting and praying. The rooftop garden was underwhelming for me. I initially planned to stay and enjoy the garden and the view but the garden had walls around it, so no view."
,,Great if you've never been to another Buddhist Temple before,3.0,,"One stop shop for your Buddhist crash course in Singapore. Level 1 is usually filled with people praying and chanting. You can explore other levels which have the Buddha museum, relics, and the viewing of the Tooth Relic, and the open garden on the 5th floor.

Underwhelming if you have been to Bangkok or Siem Reap, Cambodia but still worth a peek if and when in Singapore."
,,Biased review.,5.0,,I'm a Buddhist therefore this review is slightly biased. A very atmospheric temple with lots of wonderful pali chanting though to little area to pray and a few too many tourists (though they bring valuable donations). Wotlrthless a visit though whatever your beliefs.
,,Beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown in Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown in Singapore. You can visit all the floors, and at the top has a beautiful garden, has a museum and a souvenirs shops also. And when has the cerimonies all gosh it is even more magnific."
,,"A mixture of history, culture, and religion",5.0,,"This, I think, is my favorite attraction in Singapore. It has the mixture of history, culture, and religion: a perfect place for a tourist who loves places like this.

The staff are very courteous and amiable. Even their guards are very enthusiastic to answer your questions."
,,Excellent temple to take visitors,4.0,,"and there is a delightful Buddhist vegetarian meal served in the basement, you have to pay what you feel appropriate but basically it is a donation. What a wonderful temple!"
,,Lovely temple with lots to explore inside,4.0,,"This is a beautiful temple in the middle of Chinatown. It's home to a small, free of charge museum and there is a cute little garden on the roof - so be sure to check out every floor! Definitely a must-see when in Chinatown."
,,Brilliant in many respects,5.0,,"Brilliant gold icons, peaceful, visitors respectful, staff quietly efficient... all you'd expect from a Buddhist temple."
,,the must see in Singapore's Chinatown,5.0,,the must see in Singapore's Chinatown area. I had the honor to pass during the afternoon service. Very instructive for visitors are the upper floors with further decorations.
,,Not that much to see.,2.0,,"Not really that much to see. You can enter the temple doorway and watch the monks chanting monotonously. And, if you are that way inclined, you can pray. The buding itself is squashed in amongst the general urban melee, so taking good outside photographs is difficult. I really wouldn't bother unless you are particularly interested in Buddhism."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"A beautiful temple with amazing ornamentation. It consists of a large Buddha statue in the center and around hundred small Buddhas around it. This place was filled with such tranquility!
The temple has a strict dress code- shoulders and knees need to be covered ( especially for women). They provide a sarong and a scarf at the entrance so that one goes in in a proper dress code.
It is close to the Chinatown MRT station, so one can take the MRT and walk down. Also situated nearby is The Chinatown Food Street, a must visit."
,,"Bright, lively Chinese temple",4.0,,"Very active, colorful, welcoming Chinese temple. We were there just before the mid-autumn festival and they were preparing for special offerings, including the biggest moon cake I have ever seen. Even without the festival ""extras"", this is still worth visiting. Lots of gold, bright colors, lots of people running around. no problem bringing kids in and taking lots of photos. Can walk through in 15-20 mins."
,,A great temple to visit.,5.0,,A beautiful peaceful oasis in the heart of Chinatown. Well worth allocating a few hours to investigate every floor.
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,Beautiful temple which is still active and wonderful to visit when in use and here the monks chanting.
,,Modern Temple marvel,5.0,,"Modern Temple marvel. If you have never seen a temple and this will be your first, nothing will live up to it. Go to the 3rd floor. You will need to mock up if you are wearing sleeveless and shorts."
,,Must go and experience in Singapore,5.0,,Fantastic to visit. Peaceful oasis. When you spend time going through the different levels you can feel your selfe find calmness . The rooftop garden is amazing.

,,Worth spending a bit of time here.,5.0,,There is so much more to see here than just the shrine on the ground floor. Upstairs there are some really informative displays that can teach you a great deal about Buddhism. We were really glad we took the time and trouble to visit all the floors. The roof garden is particularly nice.
,,Quiet Contemplation Amid Chinatown’s Hubbub,5.0,,"The temple is definitely worth a visit, with its rich features and exhibits on Buddhist art and culture.The Buddha Tooth Relic is housed in an inner chamber that only the monks are allowed to enter. The Sacred Light Hall on the fourth floor, contains the temple’s centrepiece. Make sure to visit the roof garden, with its pagoda and Buddha prayer wheel, a good spot to enjoy the peace and tranquility."
,,Buddhist temple,5.0,,"The place in very peaceful, locals come there to meditate. Inside is AC running, has elevator to get to the top floor. The roof garden is not to be missed--unique place!"
,,"Very interesting, made to feel welcome",5.0,,"I like cultural visits and learning new things, this was no exception. The Temple is well organised and interesting to tour yourself. Head to the roof for some great garden away from the crowd and see the ""tooth"". Definitely worth a visit and to take some great pictures."
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,Recommended by the Fihour sh Spa guy so we went for a look Very colorful and beautifully maintained Good way to spend an hour after you have wandered through the usual cheap souvenirs in China Town
,,Nice Visit in Chinatown,5.0,,"Right in the middle of Chinatown, you may as well go there if you're going Chinatown anyway. Spectacularly bright red, and gigantic, it is a must to see this fantastic piece of architecture and rich history.

The interior of the temple is also extremely well presented and outstanding. Although I did not spend my time inside or attempt to go higher up the floors, it was a great visit."

,,Very Beautiful and Peaceful!,5.0,,"If you're in the Chinatown area in Singapore, make sure you check out this temple! I thought it was beautiful and peaceful, and it was amazing to see 10,000 buddhas! I didn't spot the ""tooth"" though... I would definitely check this out. (Went Summer 2012)."
,,Nice temple with lots of decoration.,4.0,,"It is amazing how much people have invested to the decoration of this temple. It gives the temple a glamorous look. In the same time, modern instruments like big loudspeakers, air conditioners are found in this place. What makes you feel bit funny."
,,Interesting,5.0,,Everything you need to know will be revealled on a visit to this temple and museum - a place of quiet in a busy city
,,Understanding Buddha through unbiased displays,5.0,,Fantastic display of Buddha statues and understanding of the Buddhism way of life. Easy access from Chinatown Mrt
,,Not really authentic,1.0,,The location of this temple is great but it is not really authentic it was built maybe 10-15 years ago. Thiam Hock Keng on Telok Ayer Street has much more history and charm.
,,Can you spot the tooth?,4.0,,Check this temple out when you are in Chinatown. Not that you can really make out much of the tooth :-)! But it's very pretty on all floors and a nice oasis after the bustle of Chinatown
,,Nice calm place,5.0,,This is a well maintained and very clean place. The people here are very helping. The museum gives you a lot of information about Budha and a great roof top garden also. You can see the world's largest prayer wheel here

,,Beautiful temple!,4.0,,"The temple is very beautiful. Located in the heart of chinatown. This temple is very accesible. You can simply reach this temple, by bus or mrt. It's just a few minutes walk from the nearest bus stop or mrt."
,,Peaceful & Intricate,5.0,,What amazing work must have gone into creating such an artistic masterpiece. The chanting of the monks during the day is quite mesmerising. The peace and tranquility of the tooth relic floor is something you have to experience to understand.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Amongst the many temples in town, this stands out as its in the middle of china town and you are allowed in to see an actual service. Photography was also allowed. Worth the visit"
,,Nice temple,5.0,,This is the place that I recommend when you visit singapore. This place is so beautiful and feel peaceful when you visit here. If you are Buddhist or any religion you shouldn't miss it.
,,Truly peaceful,3.0,,"Extremely interesting and peaceful. The roof gardens are particularly peaceful considering that this is based in busy china town. you must cover up as a sign of respect, however they do have warp around skirts and tops for those people who happen to be in shorts and vest tops. definitely worth a visit if you are in this part of the world."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This temple and museum was amazing. It is very beautiful and is right there by China town. So i was able to do both!
,,Serenity within the bustle of China Town,4.0,,"Worth a visit for the architecture, and to see a temple so very different from the one in Sri Lanka. Went on a Sunday morning when 'services' were on. Important to remember that this is a place for worship and to dress and behave accordingly."
,,One of the nicest temples I've been to,5.0,,The BTRTM is a real treasure in the middle of Chinatown and the CBD where you find immediate peace. They teach you the history of Buddha and the roof Orchid Garden is great as well.
,,No ancient style,2.0,,"No charm, it looks old only from far otherwise it is only a replica of a Chinese temple. The best part is the roof top with the orchid garden."
,,You should go there when you visit china town in Singapore,5.0,,"It is a good attraction in china town area. inside have many knowledge of Buddhism especially, in south east asia. Have wax figure of monks. Sometime people do a ceremony inside but i dont sure about the time. have air condition, clean toilett outside have the local ice-cream you should try!"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"This was an interesting place to visit. The staff were friendly. You are able to take photos but not on all levels (5 in all). There is lots to read so if you do it properly, it could take a couple of hours. Ladies need to have their shoulders covered but if you are wearing a vest top, they do supply a shawl. There is no charge for this visit.
It is easy to get to by foot. It would be suitable for all age groups"
,,Must visit,5.0,,Beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown. The temple for itself worth a visit. See how locals live their faith.
,,A really interesting place,5.0,,"It was a really interesting visit. You can meet some persons would will be very happy to explain you everything they know about this wonderful temple.
I always go for a walk in Chinatown with all our visiting friends! it is peaceful and really interesting. Better to find a singaporean who will help you to understand..."
,,Tranquility on a main road!,5.0,,"What a wonderful find, unfortunately for us, there was road works and in the immediate vicinity, but we were able to enter and view, what an amazing place, so beautiful, and ornate, they were preparing for a festival and it was wonderful to view.
It is not very accessible for an wheel chair users and it is only open until 7pm every night, but it is lovely to go and view at night, and when the road works have finished the full view will be beautiful."
,,Beautiful place with golden Buddha idols,4.0,,Beautiful place with golden Buddha idols. Great to visit once. In the middle of crowded China town this place is a small quite place worth the visit.
,,"Beautiful culture and architecture, inside and out",4.0,,"An entire temple built around a supposed tooth of Buddha! Beautiful architecture, both inside and out, and a place where you'll see Buddhists actively practicing and praying.

Quite charming and worth a quick visit inside. Note, you cannot wear a hat, and women must be modestly dressed. If you have too much bare skin showing, they will ask you to cover it with provided coverings."

,,Very strange feeling to this temple,2.0,,"It's no double that, this is a temple for tourism. It's very new, a lot of things relative to donation, maybe too much. I have visited many many Buddhism temples including in Thailand, Tibet, Nepal and Southern China. None of them is similar like this one."
,,It was a serene place to spend time.,5.0,,The most impressive Temple.The embroidery on the altar backcloths was spectacular . It was colorful and well signed explaining all you saw . Well worth a visit
,,Peaceful place and easy to go,4.0,,Location : Located near the Maxim Foodcourt (popular restaurant for Chicken rice) and easy to find this place by MRT. Peaceful place.

,,A beautiful place.,5.0,,A visit to this beautiful place would be informative and enjoyable to people of any belief. Some of the relics are quite breathtaking. It is a calm and welcoming place. Above the 4th floor is a most tranquil and lovely rooftop garden. The orchids in the garden are wonderful. You can spend as long as you want here. Just a lovely place to relax for a while.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,Very peaceful and calming. Chanting happens through out the day and the concept of over a 1000 Buddha statues is worth a look.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"The Toof Relic Temple is not only beautiful and well maintained but a functional place of worship. It is incredibly well presented and educational, and the roof top garden is an a amazing place to sit and find a moment of peace away from the busy near by city office areas. I spent over an hour wandering around on my own to fill some time and really loved exploring and learning.

The Temple is easy to find as it can be seen from most streets as you approach it, right next to the food court. It is slightly more complicated to navigate (it took me a while to locate the staircases!), and must be respected. You can take photos in most of the areas but there are signs for no flash photography.

I was surprised that there was no entry fee, and left a donation in the hopes that this place will continue at the high standard I found it in."
,,Hidden garden on the top,5.0,,"When you come to Singapore, this place must in your list to visit, if you enjoy about culture and Buddhism. On the ground floor, beautiful setting and statue, check which year you were born, then you can find out which type of Buddha is related to your year of birth.

Take the lift to level 4 (if i am not wrong), in this hall, no photo taking. great place to do meditation, monk blessing at certain day and time, usually on weekend. place your money inside red envelope for donation to monk after you being blessed

from here, climb up the stair to the roof top, small garden with beautiful orchids, and there is a Tibetan wheel on the middle for your to try and made a wish. sit down and relax, enjoy the atmosphere."

,,A must see when in Singapore.,5.0,,"A must see when in Singapore. Ladies, no short shorts, and you must cover you shoulders, they do provide shawls, however can get very hot on the walk around the temple, I would advise taking your own."
,,Should not be missed!,4.0,,"I used to live in SIngapore, but this visit was my first to enter the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum - and it is impressive! A full service was being held and it was quite a sight admist all the gold and reds of this beautiful temple. I also liked the mezzanine floor to look down upon the service from behind bamboo screens, and the lovely tranquil roof garden too. So glad I had the opportunity to explore at last."
,,Sheer Enlightenment!,5.0,,I have recently started getting inclined towards Buddhism and this place was like the best gift given to me as a beginner. Mesmerizing is the word for this place. In the midst of Chinatown lies this beautiful temple with so much calmness and peace. Most of the tourists might just walk-in and walk-out of the temple getting amazed at the huge Buddha Idol on the ground floor. But the best is on the 4th Floor - Where the actual tooth is kept. Also don't miss the Rooftop!
,,A must visit place in chinatown.,4.0,,The temple has different floors that offer different things from a garden to museum and a meditation area. I love it how the temple make you feel how rich their culture is. Plus its an added factor that you dont need to pay for anything when you enter
,,Immersion,5.0,,"You -thankfully- can't take pictures inside, yet this free experience is worth any other paid one in the city : we arrived right in the middle of a ceremony : people were singing scriptures, the monks playing music

The place is stunning and explains a tiny bit some of the beliefs behing the religion. Don't expect to learn much, though : go for the experience."
,,Beautiful building.,4.0,,"In Chinatown this is a beautiful piece of Chinese architecture. Whilst I didn't go inside, the outside is well worth a look."
,,Unreal,4.0,,The Buddha Tooth Temple was unbelievable. Everything was kept in pristine order and it is a credit to them for keeping it so clean and tidy. A must when visiting Singapore.
,,Temple,4.0,,"Lovely temple well worth seeing - an oasis in the midst of Chinatown, though it is set up for tourists to view. Some amazing buddha statues."
,,Nice to experience other cultures,5.0,,A must see location in chinatownd. Come see and experience a service eith your family. We are catgolic must not be buddist to enjoy
,,A marvellous insight into a different religion,4.0,,"The temple of the Buddha tooth relic offered a really interesting insight into buddhism.
It is located just next to Chinatown and is free of charge.
You can visit the first floor which is the general admission area, the second floor, which is a museum of sorts (with several wax statues of Dalai Lama).
The actual Buddha tooth relic temple is located on the last floor. You can take the elevator to get there. After you've that you can get on the roof it self which sports an orchid garden and a well preserved prayer wheel."
,,Enjoyed Our Visit,5.0,,"Very interesting place. Save for some loud visitors while we were there, the overall calmness and serenity of this place makes it worth the visit (as does the fact it is free to enter). Do visit the mezzanine level and question if the monks are real or not and visit the rooftop garden.

,,A fascinating and colorful temple,5.0,,This temple opens at 7:00 a.m. which makes for the perfect attraction to take in at the start of the day. The staff were friendly and helpful and the signage included English descriptions which made it easy for us to self tour the areas of the temple. This is a place of worship so respect is a requirement but photos are allowed and free - as opposed to the fee charges in other temples/shrines in Chinatown.

,,Peaceful free and informative,5.0,,We visited here when we were in china town. The downstairs section is a working temple and you can see local people singing and worshipping. The upstairs leave has a garden and it is very peaceful. You would never know you were in the middle of the city. The most interesting section was the history of Buddhism and how it come to be. I didn't know a lot about Buddhism but this was informative and interesting and was easy to understand. I learned a lot. There were then the two other floors which are museum like. Well worth the visit. Air conditioned and interesting.

,,Make sure you go all the way to the top floor.,4.0,,This is right in the middle of the Chinatown market shopping precinct and withing easy distance of the MRT station. Make sure you go all the way to top floor to see the golden room with the tooth relic. It is spectacular.
,,It's wonderful place to look around,5.0,,"It's a really awesome place to look around. There are hundreds of statues of buddha (maybe not the buddha). there is a statue skin's color like blue, it's really attracting.

when I visited the Temple, there were many buddhist, they were praying and reading scriptures enthusiastically.

If you go to the temple around lunch time, you should visit the maxwell center and try to have the chiken with rice. you can feel the heaven."

,,Buddhist temple,4.0,,This buddhist temple is locate near China Town...you can go there from China Town...nice temple in Singapore

,,Wonderful,4.0,,"There was an activity when we got there. We were just exploring the area near our hostel and found this temple here in chinatown. The building was amazing, so unique and captivating. The details of the buildings and statues were carefully designed, complicated yet beautiful. We took pictures of people praying inside and left soon so not to bother them with their prayers."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,Located near the end of china town we made a short stop for taking some pics. It can easily clubbed with the visit to china town.
,,This is the best Temple that I visited in Singapore,5.0,,"Be prepared to spend a few hours here as it is so educational and so magical. There are 4 floors & a roof garden with the most amazing prayer wheel.
Had a blessing done while there in the mediation room.
Each floor tells the story of Buddha and his passage of time. The artifacts and the statues are amazing. Used amazing twice but it was just that."
,,Peaceful and inspiring,5.0,,"PROS: Peaceful, quiet and serene. Fully air-conditioned and very cool. Simple layout and wonderful location near Chinatown if you are up for any shopping or Chinese dining afterwards. CONS: None!"
,,Impressive & informative,4.0,,"Beautiful temple - everything feels a little larger than life. Thoroughly enjoyed the museum - I found it very informative. Definitely worth a visit - there's no entrance fee, but there are a couple of donation boxes around. For comfort, it would be best to go dressed appropriately - a top with sleeves and knee length bottoms, at least. Otherwise, one could borrow the readily available brown sarongs and assorted scarves available at the entrance."
,,A good vibe Temple in the middle of Chinatown,5.0,,The Shrine is beautiful but the energy from the temple as well. Get up to the roof top terrace and replenish yourself in the middle of Chinatown!
,,Nice for a few snapshots,4.0,,"In the heart of Chinatown, it's hard to miss. So definitely worth spending 10 or 15 minutes for some photo opportunities. There was some sort of ceremony in progress, which one could watch, but no picture taking allowed. Don't know if it was because of the ceremony, or just in general. However, the front ""courtyard"" was no problem. There was a sign advertising a guided tour later on, and I would have stayed for it if I didn't have to wait. But it was a pleasant diversion, anyway."
,,Beautiful Temple!,5.0,,This temple over 5 stories has been one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore! Well worth a visit!
,,I must have been at another temple!!!,3.0,,After reading the previous comments I think I must have been somewhere else. My main memory is of being directed to take off my shoes and pay $3 for camera photos and $5 for videos. Most of the temple was roped off so there was only the foyer to wander around barefoot. Do remember thinking that one of the participants in the ceremony looked rather out of place with his skirt and full sleeve tattoo!!!
,,Interesting,3.0,,"One of the best Buddhist temple in Singapore. Location is perfect, at the heart of Chinatown. A must for the tourists of this beautiful city where I live and that I love!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Loved it. Such a beautiful building. Friendly and offer free literature. There was a festival when i went singing and chanting was relaxing and many offering.
,,"Not a ""must-see"" temple, but impressive nonetheless.",4.0,,"Located in the heart of Chinatown, the temple seemed ridden with tourists, however, it is still a very impressive building and free to visit so if you are in the area, I definitely recommend visiting. It is also within walking distance of numerous restaurants and tourists shopping alleys.

TIP: Dress modestly (long skirt and covered shoulders), or wear the the tourist clothing provided."
,,Mesmerizing!,5.0,,Great visit in Chinatown. Make it a must on your visit to Chinatown and wander inside the temple premises to see the magnificent Buddha statues. Please come dressed appropriately (shoulder covered) to enter into the premises.
,,Lovely Temple,5.0,,"A must see, pretty modern but a gem of tranquillity in the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. MRT to Chinatown and take a walk through the colourful stalls that lead you to the temple. Go to the the roof top and see the the grand prayer bell."
,,Beautiful Temple in a Great Locality,5.0,,We reached the temple just 15 mins before it was to be closed. Its a beautiful temple with amazing architecture. It is located in Chinatown which also provides a very unique experience. MUST VISIT this when in Singapore.
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,What a great temple. We were lucky enough to arrive during an all day chant by local monks & followers. It was mesmerizing to watch.
,,Exciting experience at this temple,3.0,,"A functioning Buddhist temple that apparently has a rooftop garden and a museum (though I wasn't able to find it). The artwork inside is nothing short of amazing. If you are female, do dress conservatively if you want to go inside."
,,Pray and pray,5.0,,"The most beautiful temple i have ever visit in my life. After that, you could have lunch or dinner at maxwell hawker centre. There are lots of good local food."
,,Go and be enlightened,5.0,,"This was a beautiful, colourful, informative and spiritual place to visit, it costs nothing except your time and respect. The interior houses interesting imagery and not having been to many Buddhist temple I can only imagine that others hold the Buddha in equal reverence and depict the many teachings at their temples."
,,Looks great,3.0,,At the moment there is building work going on so the view is slightly obscured with fences None the less very impressive sight
,,Great place to visit. Easy to find.,5.0,,Great place to visit. Very interesting sitghts and art work and loses of religious symbolism for the Buddhists. Close to everything in Chinatown. Very impressed so left a donation! Enjoyed it a lot.
,,Beautiful Buddhas.,5.0,,Such an amazing building. Had a singlet top on so had to put a scarf around my shoulders. But it's ok they provide them. I was lucky enough that it was full with a service. Lovely chanting. Was well worth the visit. And with the Chinese markets right next door I was able to visit 2 things in my trip advisor list.
,,Must do!,5.0,,"Been few times in Singapore, but this time I had the opportunity to see temple in Chinatown. If you had the luck to be there during ceremonial service the feeling is great, but also many Buddhist ceremonial objects and art are extraordinary to see. Best way is to use the elevator then climb stairs to Roof garden and start visit from there. You should not miss it!"
,,Very divine and charming place,5.0,,Only the ground floor was open.rest of the floors were closed.it takes less than 30 mins to visit the entire temple.very soothing and nice temple.we loved it.
,,Definitly do not miss this if you are in ChinaTown,4.0,,If you are in China Town you absolutely must stop and see the temple. Don't be shy go on inside and see the amazing interior. It definitely should not be missed.
,,An interesting Buddhist experience,4.0,,"When I was in Singapore 8 years ago I mistook this enormous temple as a shopping mall. This time I'd done my homework and recognised it for what is was.
The scantily clad female members of the family were required to don shawls and wraps to hide their nakedness but my body seems to have lost its appeal so I was allowed to enter as is.
We arrived in the middle of a service with a pair of monks leading the chanting and banging a drum and bell. It was quite an atmospheric occasion and we hung around on the periphery taking in the sights, sounds and smells some time. The Church of England could learn something from here about making their services accessible.
Jess sat on the steps outside but managed to find a local who wanted to assist her in exploring the building much further."
,,PEACEFUL,5.0,,"A really unexpected tranquility from the hustle and bustle of Singapore, with such strong Buddhist culture and heritage. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a great place to find peace within the city and wandering through the different rooms with intricate decorations. A place not to be missed!"
,,Visitor,5.0,,Beautiful temple with relics and amazing religious statues. A really great experience. A peaceful place of worship
,,A Tibetan Buddhist Temple,3.0,,"When we went there, there's people praying because it's just a couple days after the 1st of the lunar month...
The main hall is great...
There's not much to see here other than the main hall...
The area around it is full of 5 feet stalls add bargain goods...
In front of the temple there's renovation being done by the government"
,,amazing place,5.0,,"goosebumps! the temple was so solemn and amazing, all the buddhas was beautiful, it was a free entry, picture taking is also allowed inside, what a memorable visit to this temple, i really love it"
,,Loved it,4.0,,"Ornate, beautiful, interesting. It looks a bit rough and plain outside but inside is a myriad of colours filled with figurines of every form each with its own story. U could spend a couple of hours here just reading every story behind every God. Amazing."
,,a must thing to do in singapore china town,3.0,,one of the best tourist attraction in singapore china town. it's good place to make a merit and appreciate chiness architecture.
,,Love it,5.0,,"Have you ever imagined there is a nice Chinese style temple in this vibrant city? You will amazed with all the architectures, red colored lines and decorations in this lovely temple. I bet you will really amazed with wonderful ambiance of the temple as well."
,,Fold!,2.0,,"I always check out the top Trip Advisor attractions when visiting a new place and we were looking forward to seeing this temple.
The experience began outside the entrance where everyone was shouted at ... ""shoes in rack"".
Inside, everything was roped off with ""no tourists"" signs and there was quite a bit of activity that looked like setting up for something.
When returning the robe (provided to cover shoulders and legs above the knee), even though I folded it, I was shouted at again ""fold!""
Not at all a pleasant experience. If they were preparing for something it would have been much better to close the temple to visitors that day."
,,An excellent insight into Buddhism,5.0,,"This temple provides an excellent insight into Buddhist culture. Its an actual active temple (if you are lucky you may witness a service with monks chanting) with a museum and roof garden. I believe it was built in 2005 (they even have an underground car park, how often do you see those in temples?)so its not what you'd normally call 'historical', but its a very pleasant site to see anyway.
You need to be dressed decent to come inside, but they do provide you with scarves to cover bare shoulders if you happen to not wear something they find suitable.
The museum is free of charge which doesn't happen often in Singapore.
Make sure to go up and visit a roof garden.
The temple is located in Chinatown, walking distance from MRT station and is open till 7pm."
,,Good place- nearby shopping is good,3.0,,its good and near Chinatown MRT so visit it .nearby market is good for shopping you can also try local Chinese fod here in the market.
,,Another spot to see the tooth relic,5.0,,This is an interest museum in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown. I love seeing Buddha statues so this appealed to me. However I did wonder about the actual tooth reluc as there is something similar at Kandy in Sri Lanka. Good to visit you'll enjoy.
,,Just what I envisioned a chinese temple to be.,5.0,,Very ornate. Feels like I was in China. The building is very well maintained. Have to be properly attired to visit inside the temple.
,,Wonderfull Place,4.0,,"Very nice see this place, building in the central city of Singapore. This place be neighbors with mosque and market place, very tolerant."
,,See Buddha tooth and learn history of Buddha and its teachings,4.0,,"This building is located at Chinatown. I went into this building recently for a visit.

This building has several floors. At the top floor is where the Buddha tooth relic is housed. Its encased in a closed room and you can see a close-up of it on two TV screens which are connected to a live camera feed.

Its quite enlightening to see it.

On the lower floors is a section dedicated to the history of Buddha and his teachings. You can also see artefacts from throughout history displayed here.

On the ground floor are prayer halls where you can walk along its perimeter and see the many Buddha statues.

This is a good pit stop if you are visiting Chinatown. Allocate 30 minutes here."
,,"A colourful, modern, high-rise temple.",3.0,,"When in Chinatown you may as well pay a visit to this attraction. It is relatively new but offers many photo opportunities. Being within yards of the Maxwell Rd food market and the famous Smith St, you can conveniently enjoy local food at the same time."
,,Beautiful and amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful place with many artifacts to view and libraries too read, too bad for the language barriers with most books but still, amazing. Could get lost in it for days like a young monk's first time in a glorious temple."
,,Magnificent and extravagantly stylish,4.0,,"The interior of the temple gives me an extravagantly stylish impression with the many magnificently golden Buddhist artifacts and sculptures lustrously occupying every corner of the many halls. Based on the architectural model of the Tang Dynasty, I was amazed by the meticulously intrinsic design of the building structure.

The towering 75-million temple building appears to be un-proportionally clamped on a piece of land right in the core of Chinatown between the Chinatown Complex and Maxwell Food Center. Constructed in 2008, it is believed to house the left canine tooth of the Lord Buddha but controversy remains as to the authenticity of the tooth relic. The temple abbot rejected the appeal by donors for DNA verification as he argued that it was just an issue of perspective.

Nevertheless, the temple which was designed in a style like the Buddhist diagram of the universe (mandala) resembles a full blossom lotus flower splendidly attracting many devotees and visitors including many professional photographers.

The temple has four levels and a roof top. Right at the roof top is the 10,000 Buddha pavilion with a prayer wheel housed in the pavilion, believed to be the largest of its kind in the world. Unlike the heavy bronze revolving prayer wheel in the Tibetan monastery in the ancient town of Dukezong in Shangri la, Yunnan which require at least 3 men to maneuver the wheel, the praying wheel in this temple spares little physical effort to move it. The atmosphere at the roof garden is serene and tranquil.

On the first floor are two halls, the chamber for ancestral tablets and the Maitreya Hall. The Maitreya Buddha is the future Buddha. The front hall also showcased the protective deities of the 12 zodiac signs. I was born under the astrological zodiac animal of the Boar and my protective deity was the Amitabh Buddha.

On the second floor contains an exhibition hall for religious art and a depository for Buddhist texts, as well as a teahouse, reference library and shop. On the third floor is a Buddhist culture museum featuring artifacts and relating the events of the Buddha’s life and a chamber containing “sariras”, relics of the Buddha, his disciplines and eminent monks.

The fourth storey holds the centerpiece of the BTRTM, the Sacred Light Hall which contains the Buddha tooth relic

Admission into the temple is free and joss sticks are provided free for the praying and you can make donations by dropping your coins or dollars into the respective donation box or make a outright donation at the admin office on the first floor. There is also a free Buddhist publication corner where you can access to free periodicals on Buddhism. The temple is open at 7 am but the second, third and four floors are open for viewing after 9 am.

I have been to the temple on several occasions and I think it is very unique with the many Buddhist sculptures and artifacts. You can take the MRT to Chinatown station. You should not miss this attraction in Chinatown."
,,Fascinating.,5.0,,"We really were not sure about this attraction but it turned out to be jaw dropingly gorgeous. The building work outside might put you off, don't let it. Go inside, view the beautiful gold artwork, the stunning temple altar and the deep sincerity of those who worship there. Well worth it."
,,Landmark in chinatown,4.0,,Interesting visit to an interesting building in chinatown. I recommend it mainly to people not familiar with asian culture and buddhism.
,,Worth the a trip to Chinatown ....,5.0,,"I went here with a friend who had been freaked out visiting a Hindu temple earlier and she loved it. Very peaceful and welcoming. The Hall of 1000 Buddhas, the wafting insense and the relic temple up on the 3rd floor made this a great stop on our hop on hop off bus tour ( bus stop just across the road)."
,,"Very interesting and beautiful, must do for non Buddhists too",5.0,,"Stayed here for about 2 hours,peolple are friendly and explain you everything, toke some very great pictures"
,,Worth seeing,3.0,,"We are a French family currently living in Singapore.
This is a huge temple building in the city center of Singapore, in China Town. There is a nice garden on the top floor that one would not expect. The golden room where Buddha's tooth is kept is impressive. The ground floor's praying room is also impressive by the shine of gold, not common in old/ancient temples I used to visit in other parts of Asia. This is because the Temple is relatively recent."
,,Dissonance,4.0,,"You can have an interesting visit here, but somehow all the golden décor and the newness of the place don't seem to be in harmony with the teachings on simplicity of the Buddha 2500 years ago. The same comment applies to many buildings of various religions, by the way."
,,Beautiful plave to visit,5.0,,Very relaxing and interesting place. Learnt a lot and more of an understanding of their religion. Amazing statues
,,Very tranquil.....,4.0,,"Had a lovely visit here. A few floors with very interesting things to look at. Ladies make sure your shoulders are covered, although there are throws that you can borrow in a box. Also good air conditioning and lifts to the 4 floors and a rooftop garden. If you fancy learning about Buddhism there are free books for you to take. It really is visually spectacular and worth a visit if you want some photos that are more interesting than sky scrapers."
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,The temple is calm and the feeling was unique. The main attraction is the whole temple itself. Every floor has something to show us. The top floor is where the relic is kept.
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Its a little gem situated in the middle of Chinatown. The Buddha and Bodhisattva statues and the predominantly red and gold combination make for a stunningly beautiful temple. A must visit, especially if you love photography."
,,If you are in ChinaTown already...,3.0,,"You see the Buddha tooth only from a camera / microspcope view- and not via naked eye. The temple looks more like a nicely maintained building/ as compared to Buddhist places of attractions in this region (like Thailand, Nepal, India-Ladakh, etc.). Since its located bang in the middle of China town, and if you are here, may as well visit."
,,Loved the Buddha Tooth,5.0,,"Incredible incredible Temple and Museum, I loved the rooftop garden and listening to the drum at the end of the day. It's free to go in, you'll likely be greeted with smiles. Make sure you're dressed appropriately (ladies we should cover our shoulders and wear longer shorts). It will be the first place I visit next time in SG."
,,Temple.,5.0,,An interesting museum with thousands of Buddha statues beautifully arranged - for those who are curious about buddhism - and those who want to discover cultural artefacts. The building is in itself an architectural curiosity.
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,Beautiful temple both inside and out. Nothing compared to the spectacular buddhist temples of Thailand or China but it is definitely still cool. Additionally it is still a functioning buddhist temple so occasionally you can catch the monks in the midst of ceremonies or prayers.
,,holiday with so many things to do and see.,5.0,,This place is amazing like all of Singapore. My grandson Sam loved visiting his aunt and his cousins Travel here as soon as possible.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,Do remember to you need to be mindful of what you wear when you come here. No revealing clothes. Interesting place to walk about. There are plenty of shopping and food around this temple.
,,Something to see,4.0,,An amazing temple to see. They have a dress code but they do have sarongs that you can use to walk through the temple.
,,A rejuvenating experience,5.0,,Very peaceful. Love the chanting in Pali (even though we didn't understand it). The energy in the temple is really nice and rejuvenating.
,,Garish (or Disney goes wild in Singapore),2.0,,"If there's a lesson to be learned from this monstrosity, don't let a monastic with no ID qualifications decorate. Disparate elements from Tibetan, Japanese and Chinese (from every conceivable era and mannerism) are thrown together to create an incoherent assault on the senses. Skip if you value good taste."
,,The artwork is awesome,4.0,,"Well, I came here looking for some teeth displays and I must admit that I actually couldn't find any. In fact all I found was a massive, operational, Buddhist temple. However, after reading over other people's experiences I suddenly realised that there are parts of this place that I didn't actually check out (though I don't remember seeing any way that I could get to the upper levels that wasn't reserved for the monks). As I have said, it is a functioning temple, so you will see ceremonies being performed at times, and sometimes even watching the ceremony can be impressive in itself. However you should be aware that there are restrictions on entering this temple – for instance they do not like women entering with shorts or skimpy dresses, however they do provide you with aprons to wrap around. If you do wish to have a look inside, make sure you are dressed conservatively otherwise they may not allow you to enter. Oh, I should also mentioned that the artwork inside was nothing short of amazing, though so of those statues do look quite intimidating."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"No matter you are Buddhist or not, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a great venue to visit. I recommend you to visit it."
,,An amazing temple,4.0,,Make sure you have shoulders covered and full length shorts or skirts to enter. We arrived during the chanting session which took place between 9.30 and 4.30pm. Such a beautiful building inside. There are 4 floors to visit including a beautiful roof garden too. tske time to read the information provided and enjoy!
,,"Not for everyone, but it's a good place to visit while in Chinatown",4.0,,"I encounter this place while visiting Chinatown in Singapore, it's not really my thing but I went in and took a look. Many Buddha statues and traditional."
,,Calm and beautiful temple,4.0,,"We visited here on August, placed at Chinatown aslo not far from our hotel, that we can walk to be there twice in this trip. Big buddha images are inside and many small budddha images also set on all of the wall."
,,Peaceful and Beautiful,5.0,,"I prayed to Buddha for my long lasting problems and my wish was granted. In my heart, this is a peaceful and magical place to visit each time I landed in Singapore. I believe someone is there looking over me and my family and I am very thankful to have visited this temple. All I can say is I will always pay a visit to this temple when I am back Singapore. Thank you."
,,A must,5.0,,A must! New and beautifull temple that teems with atmosphere. Verey authentic and real. Great museum at the toop floor with english explanation
,,Do the free tour of the temple,5.0,,"We went to China town several times and asked at the TOurist Info center if there were any guided tours of the temple. They said none were available. When we entered the temple to our surprise a free tour was to begin at 2 pm, lasted an hour and a half, was extremely informative, not only about the temple, but also about buddhism. They provided earpieces so we could hear well. Highly recommended!"
,,Peaceful and beautiful,4.0,,"I stumbled upon this temple when walking through China Town. It's a beautiful temple and very peaceful, well worth a wander through"
,,One of the largest temples,5.0,,"One of the best temples to visit in Chinatown. Easily located on South Bridge Road. Remove shoes before entering, don't worry they won't disappear."
,,Beautiful!!!!,5.0,,"For temples around Singapore - this is one of the best to visit! The entrance courtyard hides from the out side the real view that you get from inside it. If you have to pick just one temple to visit in Singapore, this is the one that is worth that pick."
,,A must see in Singapore,4.0,,"A very interesting experience in the middle of China town! It is amazing to experience such a traditional and holistic temple in such an urban environment. An up close experience with the largest prayer wheel in the world, 10,000 Buddhas and one of Buddhas tooth in gold preserved behind glass. A must see!"
,,Beautiful Buddhist temple,5.0,,"Welcoming Buddhist temple in Chinatown, free to visit all 4 floors and roof garden with the largest cloisonné prayer wheel in the world. Interesting museum explaining the life of Buddha with relics from SE Asia, meditation areas and mesmeric chanting when a ceremony is taking place in the temple on ground level. Cover up clothing provided if needed."
,,Amazing Temple,4.0,,"There was a lot of construction work going on when we visited but it will be good once finished as a new MRT station will be right next to the Temple.
If you don't have clothes to cover up and be respectful to the Buddhist religion then they have sarongs that you can use for the duration of your visit.
It is an amazing museum with lots of artifacts and the history is really interesting.
The top level, which houses the Tooth Relic, is so ornate and the amount of gold used is astounding. There are a lot of people meditating here.
There is only one lift so we used the stairs a lot which wasn't a problem."
,,"Amazing,",4.0,,"On entering this Temple, be respectful and make sure if you are female to cover your arms and legs, otherwise you have to leave or wear the coverings offered by the guides.
Several ceremonies were being conducted when we arrived but we could still move around quietly to see all the temple."
,,peace and Tranquility,5.0,,What an amazing and peaceful place. Some of the artifacts on display are so old and yet well preserved and displayed. Peace and tranquility in a busy world
,,Impressive Commercialised Buddhism,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth temple in Singapore's Chinatown is a much-visited Buddhist site styled in the mould of the Tang Dynasty. It is a large and colourful building, relatively modern in its construction. It is a fascinating combination of traditional Buddhism with very modern commercial values.

The rich reds reflecting auspicious sentiment make it an attractive building both inside and out. The opulent golds are a reminder of the sparkle used in this region of the world to reinforce success.

Buddha Tooth is something of an entry-level Buddhist location - it is easy to follow with bright lights and plenty of space. Despite being popular and busy, the temple is more than large enough to accommodate those passing through. The pagoda style will be familiar to most, everything is easy to understand.

The statues and decor are not the most ornate, a Naga statue behind the main podium is easy to spot on the way out but not especially elaborate.

The rear entrance/exit opens directly out into Chinatown proper. The traditional culture of Buddhism in the heart of modern Singaporean Chinatown. There is something commercial about the Buddha Tooth temple all round though. It gives the impression of profit and success, there are opportunities for purchase and donation.

A commercialised version of Buddhism, perhaps not one for the purist but an impressive building and lots of bright shiny things to see."
,,Gem in Chinatown,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Temple was recommended to us as a replacement for the China Cultural Centre being temporarily closed. What a great choice. We learned so much not only from the detailed and revered temple, but from the very straightforward and easy to understand museum as well. Up top the courtyard outside and prayer wheel were delightful as well. A great education for all who visit!"
,,Fascinating regardless of your religion,5.0,,"This temple occurs on the same street as a mosque and a Hindu temple. This Buddhist centre doubles up as a working shrine and a museum, and the museum is full of beautiful statues. Admission is free, and you are allowed to take photographs everywhere except the top level Budhha relic shrine. You also need to remove your shoes on the top level. Female visitors in particular should dress conservatively."
,,The sanctuary,5.0,,"Avoid from the heat of Singapore and crowded China town, this temple is my sanctuary. There are the roof top garden that you can take a rest and the fifth floor that you can do a meditation. The toilets are free and clean. If you come at the right time, you will see the monks pray."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Definitely one of the most amazing places in Singapore. Regardless of what do you believe in and faith orientation, the whole place inspires you to stay humble and eager to learn.

Would recommend booking a guided tour in advance, we didn't and I feel we lost a lot of the value of the place. Even without a guide the narratives and explanations written on every part paints an amazing photo and guide you through a journey.

100% recommended go with an open mind good attitude and comfortable shoes... When you are finish, go across the plaza to a great food market :)"
,,PEACEFUL,5.0,,"This place is so lavish and detailed. Feasted my famished eyes! This place literally wowed me. And it's so peaceful uggh. The people were friendly as well. Unfortunately, we did not get to visit the other layers of this temple. But would visit again."
,,Excellent insight into the Buddhist religion,4.0,,"This temple stands out from it's surroundings and is easy to find. It is not as old as it looks, but a visit to every floor and the roof top will give an insight into the beliefs and history of the Buddhist religion. Free to enter, it does give the impression of a retail opportunity, the upper floors are quite different. Remember to take your shoes off entering the chamber of the tooth relic!"
,,So much detail to see,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to go in when a ceremony was taking place. There are sarongs at the front door to the left and right (brown in color), the person by the entrance will point you towards them if your wearing shorts. The main room is amazing to see all the different Buddhas with the service going on the middle.Worth stopping in to see if your walking around Chinatown"
,,You should visit this temple,5.0,,We visited this temple as part of our free China town walk. Although it looks old this is a new building. It is very impressive and I feel it is alway a privilege to be able to visit a temple while they are in full use.
,,Must experience,5.0,,"This was a wonderful place, beautiful inside - you must visit of you go to Singapore, you need to see the inside as well as the fascinating building"
,,Informative and peaceful,5.0,,"This is a venue quite literally in different layers. There is the sacred floor with the tooth of the Buddha. You need to take your shoes off here and women need to be covered. The room is quiet, bright and wonderfully decorated and despite your faith of not it is hard not to be impressed by the grander of the room.
The roof garden was peaceful and lovely. I was impressed that there was a disabled chair lift to the top floor and even into the bell tower at the top.
The museum about Buddha's life and acolytes was really interesting and the artefacts and presentation made it very accessible to the lay person.
My favourite room was the entrance, listening to the monks and others chant before the Buddha was mesmerising. As a woman you do need to have your shoulders and knees covered. If you haven't dressed appropriately they have covers for you, (Remember this is about respect for other cultures not an opportunity to assert our own!! )

We spent a good couple of hours here and entertained two children (11/17). It was all free ( donation encouraged) and disabled friendly with two sets of clean toilets."
,,It's a nice temple,4.0,,"It's free and easy to walk by, stunning views of the statues and also the are explanations of their gods and their costumes. It's like an 20min tour..."
,,Well worth visiting,4.0,,It's a beautiful building on the outside but on the inside it's quite amazing and well worth visiting if you are in the vicinity of Chinatown.
,,Lovely.,4.0,,Staying in China Town. It's free and beautiful. The tooth is available to see during the day and the temple is open in the early evening too. Check out the tapestries. Won't take long but amazing.
,,Be there in the very short opening hours,4.0,,"This is yet another must see. However, instead of seeing the relic, which is impossible as it is incased in gold, try to witness the people around praticing their religion. It is only open very few minutes twice a day, make sure that you get there at this time.

We bought a guide outside. This was great. It is ""free"", i.e. they work for tips. Expect to pay them between 500 and 2000 LKR (given that a days salary is 1200 - 1500 LKR and the tour is around 1½ hours)"
,,Cultural site,5.0,,"Worth visiting site. I went there with my family on a sunny they, luckily there was a ceremony there so we were able to see the process. Even we couldn't get inside because it was packed, we still had a great time"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"We went when there was a service which was mesmerising, beautiful building temple of a thousand Buddhas in a great area of china town."
,,Temple of Peace,5.0,,Temple with serenity especially the third floor wherein one can meditate in peaceful & silent ambiance next to the tooth relic. Great temple to visit.
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,3.0,,Liked the opulence of a temple that is still being used by worshippers. Didn't see the museum or signs pointing to it. Thought we would be able to go upstairs but couldn't find the signage to get there.
,,Fantastic temple and museum,5.0,,"We spent a while here, beautiful watching the ceremony and the museum on the upper levels is fabulous. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Gorgeous Buddhist temple,5.0,,It's a Chinese Buddhist temple with the arts of carvings and historic marks. Fully air conditioning temple which will never happen in other place. There are 4 floors with different Buddhist culture from different countries.
,,Don't miss the rooftop garden!,4.0,,A somewhat imitation of a Chinese temple but very tastefully done with a peaceful and serene atmosphere. Ladies must cover up but they can provide shawls etc for that. It's worth visiting just for the rooftop garden. Wish Singapore had more peaceful places like this.
,,A great sacred place for buddhist,5.0,,"The place is devoted for offering prayer for the upcoming buddha on ground level, level 2 and level 3 is mainly museum with various buddha statues and painting contributed from countries around the world and the top floor have the great shrine for Buddha Tooth relic...its a great soothing place and one can also stop by for meditation if desired."
,,Inviting temple,4.0,,"Did not have the chance to closely look into this temple, but I promise to visit this place, we only passed by because we were running out of time. The structure was impressive and inviting, many people were getting in and out of the place."
,,Buddha Temples are Fascinating for Me,5.0,,It's a really pretty temple and ornate. There are thousands of buddhas all over and just so many pretty things to see in the temple. The monks were chanting when we visited. There were several levels. The top level is one to be sure to visit with the plants and buddhas up there. I was there right after Lee Kuan Yew died so it was interesting to see the prayer service on floor 3 or something. There was free clothing to borrow so you can cover up if you're a girl. I was wearing shorts and a tshirt as a guy and no one said anything to me. It's easy to get there and free.
,,A gem in china town,5.0,,"Beautiful temple. Shawls available at entrance to cover shoulders etc if needed. Not very large but the statues are wonderful. Monks were chanting as we visited, if you have never visited a Buddhist temple i recommend a visit to this one. Easily accessable from MRT"

,,Very impressive building,4.0,,This amazing temple is just a couple of minutes walk from the Chinatown Metro station. One can wonder inside and look at the various statues and read the explanations. Worth a visit if you have time and never been to a temple.
,,A Must do,5.0,,This temple is so very peaceful and very interesting I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore
,,Very Interesting !,5.0,,"Great place to visit, especially as it's in Chinatown. This is a well laid out temple, clean, interesting to look at. It's spread over 4 floors, and even has a rooftop garden and prayer-wheel which you must make the effort to see.

It's not well signposted to show where the lifts are to go up to the museum floor and prayer floor etc, so of you get stuck looking, as security who will gladly help.

If you're a female, as in any Buddhist temple, you will need to be appropriately covered (shoulders, arms, chest, and knees). There are sarongs that can be borrowed."
,,Very peaceful,5.0,,"We visited the temple at 9 in the morning when it was not too busy. There was a service taking place downstairs that we were able to view. The architecture of the temple is very impressive. I found the museum very interesting as it goes through the whole history of the foundation of Buddhism. On the very top floor, there is an orchid garden and a rotating prayer wheel where you can sit and meditate. Well worth a visit."
,,Welcoming to everone,5.0,,"this is a fantastic temple, with helpful staff and a welcoming feel. the beauty of this place is amazing and mesmerising inside. If you come remember to have some change on you if you are like me and want to make sure your fortune remains. :)"

,,Amazing,4.0,,Fantastic temple located in the China town precinct of Singapore. Very interesting as were the markets located near. And other specialty shops
,,Nice for a Quick Stop,3.0,,"We didn't go to the museum but did walk through the temple. It was interesting to see the architecture and all the Buddha's, but other than that not much here."
,,"Temple, Museum, Gallery",5.0,,"Services are conducted at the temple throughout the day. There is also a museum and a gallery. All are free of charge, but donations are accepted. An architectural and religious icon not to be missed."
,,Beautiful sanctuary,5.0,,"Fascinating place - loved the myriad of Buddha statues and the garden of many different orchids on the roof. Just a reminder to keep shoes on - Buddhist temples I am accustomed to, I'm used to removing my shoes. Bare legs are not allowed inside, but there are sarongs at the front door"
,,Really cool,4.0,,"wow it was so cool
you can learn about the star sign
it was nice and air conditioned
ask where the outside bit is and spin the prayer wheel
you must cover shoulders and legs, they give you things to cover up with there
you can go the the 2nd or 3rd floor and ask for a blessing"
,,If you are exploring Chinatown,3.0,,Your enjoyment of this will depend on how many temples you have been to in the past. It is bright and lovely! I quite enjoyed two monks snapping portraits of each other and the temple on their iphones.
,,well worth a visit,4.0,,This beautiful temple is well worth a visit. It is fine to take photos but make sure you are dressed correctly as mentioned in other reviews. I believe extra wraps are provided if needed. Make sure you see the beautiful orchid roof garden and prayer wheel.
,,Bling!,4.0,,"This is honestly worth seeing just for the overwhelming goodness of it all. Make sure to check opening times, we arrived a bit late and didn't have time to do it justice. This is a place of worship so its important to be respectful, my so forgot to take off his cap and was gently asked to do so."
,,"Fantastic temple, but dress accordingly to the rules",5.0,,"We arrived in Sunday about 14.00. The service inside was on, which didn't seem to stop the tourist from taking pictures and videos. Definitely worth visiting as one of the newest temples, but be aware that a knee long dress showing partly arms is not acceptable attire. All of legs and arms must be completely covered. In other words what's ok in the Vatican is not OK here. Few meters beside there is s Hindu temple, where shoes aren't allowed either, and must be left on the busy street. Figure out how to dress for the occasion;)"
,,A must visit Place,5.0,,In Singapore being in China Town this is a must visit place for you . The old style of the temple and the holiness associated with it will envelope you with all its blessings . The relic of tooth of Budha only adds to it for the faithfuls . Do not miss being here .
,,i found peace,4.0,,I didnt expect that I would enjoy a place like this but i was wrong. the museum got lots of wonderful artifact with sufficient details to view and to read. it's close to Chinatown MRT and very easy to get to.
,,Must see,5.0,,"This was fantastic. The monks and their pupils were chanting which was very interesting. The temple is fantastic with intricate carvings and deities. This is a must see! Tip: make sure weather male or female that you are appropriately dressed, wearing shorts is not allowed, however they have aprons available which you are able to wear."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Found right beside loads of stalls and shops it seems a little out of place. Its really peaceful inside with lots to see and to get an insight to another religion.
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"Magnificent temple, a must on you stroll through Chinatown. Bring your camery. Do not miss the upper floor."
,,Interesting place,5.0,,Very interesting place with so many different Buddhas I didn't know of before. Able to walk through and watch monks during prayers

,,Relax with the chanting of the monks,5.0,,Give yourself a break from the hustle and bustle to take in the calm and peaceful atmosphere of this lovely old temple. Find your guardian deity and do try to catch the monks at prayer.
,,"Don't Ask, Just Go Already!",5.0,,This was my first time visiting a temple and it was a very good experience. Observing Chinese culture first-hand is an enthralling experience and one I’m glad I had the luxury of experiencing. The amazing miniature statues as well as the displays were amazing to see. The maintenance is also first-rate and you feel welcomed as a visitor when you arrive. I highly recommend it to anyone in the Chinatown area.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"I think its a very nice place and interesting it really is woth the visit, since everything is the same in China Town. When you visit make sure to go upstairs all the way, there is a museum and a garden."
,,Very interesting cultural visit,5.0,,"Bright, colourful and interesting place. I was lucky to be there while the monks were chanting, which was very interesting and exotic. Don't miss it - it's right in the heart of Chinatown."
,,Another must in Singapore,5.0,,Not only for buddhist. Very interesting buddhist temple. Chanting session nearly the whole day. Do not forget to go up to the 4th floor where the relic tooth is kept. Also vist the roof top garden.
,,Can't see any difference from other Chinese temple in other countries,3.0,,"I went to this place a few times. My family's wanted to go once and other one was on Chinese new year. In my opinion, it wasn't anything that unique about this place."
,,Gives you a good glimpse of Buddhism,4.0,,"If you havent seen much of South East Asia, then this sight of buddhism will really please you. If you have visited several buddhist sights across the region, then you would be very pleased to see how well maintained and organized this one is!!
Nice, pleasant place - has aircon ( to beat the heat of chinatown hawker center), and is free of charge!!"
,,Good experience,4.0,,We wanted to experience the Buddhist temple experience and so we visited this place. We visited with the entire family and everyone liked the place. It was a good experience. They gave books for free depicting principles of Buddha.
,,It's one of the free entrance in Singapore,4.0,,"You can easily spend 2 hours in the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,there is a restaurant at level 2, it's has rich historical context of Buddhism at level 3 and 4. remember to visit the rooftop garden."
,,Just Beautiful,5.0,,Tang Dynasty-style temple in Chinatown Singapore. And if you are an early riser (before 10-11am Singapore time) food is hard to find. You can eat here also knowing your charge goes to a good cause. Borders the street markets and the mall. Full of peace beauty and culture.
,,One to visit on your travels,4.0,,"Great little place at the end of China Town, an oasis out of the humidity. We had a guide to explain the temple and museum. Insightful to the Buddhist Religion. Beautiful orchid display on top floor. Dress appropriately."
,,Very pleased we went,5.0,,Easily accessible - air conditioned..huge bonus as respite from Singapore heat/humidity. Blown away by whole compact & still large display.Large colourful wall drapes looked like made yesterday. Super.
,,A great place to chill out.,4.0,,"I spent a long time in here wandering around. It is so much bigger than it looks and each floor offers something different. When I went I was lucky that there were people in prayer session chanting, so there was a beautiful hum vibrating throughout the whole building. Make sure you go up to the top level and explore the roof top garden. It's beautiful. People are very friendly, don't be afraid to explore. There are also shawls availbale to cover up shoulders and legs, use them If you wish to enter the temple."
,,Bigger than we thought...,5.0,,"We thought this was an in and out affair, but it turned out to be 4 floors of relics providing a historical context for Buddahism. Well worth a visit if you are into the museum type thing."
,,Very interesting temple,4.0,,"the colourful displays, the decorative icons around the mini- Buddahs. Took stacks of photos which I can review at my leisure."
,,Must Visit Buddhist Temple to enjoy divinity,5.0,,A very beautiful temple with awe inspiring idols of Buddha. It takes you into a different world altogether. It's not just beautiful outside but even more beautiful from inside with life size idols of Buddha in the front and back. A must visit place in Singapore to enjoy the divinity.
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Its a very interesting Temple and well worth a look, a lot of different and pretty display over the 5 levels. Really loved the Garden on the top level."
,,Interesting Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"A must see if you're in Chinatown and conveniently next to the visitors center. It is free, which is nice, and they provide sarongs and wraps if you don't have appropriate attire (arms covered and knees covered). Monks are chanting when you go inside which makes it a surreal experience."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,Very nice temple. Nice details. Whn we visited the temple the monks are praying. They were chanting. Even if I am a catholic I did'nt really understand the chanting. But I felt it was really solemn and very peaceful. I really love the place!
,,Worth a look but not spectacular,3.0,,"Lots of interesting and pretty displays, but less impressive than other Buddhist temples I've seen. It seemed to take a long time to get to the Buddha tooth, and I was a bit underwhelmed when we got there. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it"
,,wonderful,5.0,,"one of the best things i seen in singapore amazing place,spent a hour or so there,its in china town,from the smell of incense, to the astonishing decor,and the rhythmically chanting,a must do when in singapore"
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"worth a visit if you are new to these architechtural monuments.very similar to Tibetan temple in Coorg, Karnataka."
,,Rich in beauty and culture...,4.0,,"stunning temple with impressive displays. Please remember no singles or shorts, you must have your upper and lower completely covered and no photographs, it's not so hard to show respect and comply. The beauty of this temple is well worth it."
,,bestat its,4.0,,go and see it although you arent allowed to take photos this place is rich in culture and is a great place to visit
,,Wonderful place. Easy and so peaceful,5.0,,"Disregard the surroundings and go straight to inner sanctum of the temple. Or better yet, go up to the 2nd or 3rd floor, where they have buddha's tooth and you will see what I mean. All five of us sat there mesmerized for hours."
,,impressive...,5.0,,very pretty and impressive on the inside. Go if you have time to. No shoulders or knees exposed. They do provide shawls and long skirts to use whilst visiting. Also respectful to make a donation .
,,"before you pass by it, take a picture from the TV monitor",5.0,,"Be prepared to cover up before entering the Temple. Lots of shawls on hand at the front entrance. The gold finishing are inspiring. This wee tooth has a huge raised presentation platform, but I wish I had taken a photo from the TV monitor. The scale of the temple vs the actual size of the scared tooth....amazing. Before you leave, walk the grounds and even though it is hot outside (50C when I was there) take the time and energy to walk up to the roof top level. It is worth it."
,,Newish Temple in Chinatown,3.0,,"Built about 25 years ago to host part of the Buddha's tooth. I prefer older temples, so didn't do a lot for me. However, I'm not religious - others might feel very differently"
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"Well worth stopping by. Such a cool place to check out when visiting Singapore, and if your lucky may see people praying too."
,,Ok,4.0,,"The temple here is not as pretty as other temples in Singapore that i've visited. But this will be a good place to visit during chinese new year or around that period as there will be decorations around Chinatown and the whole place will be pretty, and photo worthy."
,,Family Tour at Singapore,5.0,,"Lovely place! Peace place! This is just not like temple,this is museum too for the Buddhist! I like this place."
,,A very impressive and special place.,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is worth a visit. The 10 000 Buddhas are amazing to see from a spiritual and educational point of view. The the ornateness of the gold is balanced by the tranquility of the purpose. A good place to find a spot to meditate or relax on the rooftop garden.
,,Beautiful & a must visit temple,4.0,,"From the exterior of the temple, it is quite a view on how nice and detailed the building is. When you stepped into the temple, you won't be disappointed too. It is grand with the gold designs on the walls and Buddha. It is said that the golds are donated by followers/devotees, melted down to build the gold designs that you see in the temple.

For ladies, wearing shorts or loose clothing. Sarong or cloth will be provided before you step into the temple. Do visit the museum in the upper level if you have the time, it will be worth to see the sculptures."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Well worth a visit. Easy to find. We watched some kind of ceremon,not quite sure what it was but enchanting, the only downside is that it is quite commercial but at leastyou can go in and take photos and enjoy the ambience"
,,Beautiful and intreseting place to visit,4.0,,"Singapore is a small place to go around, just put this place in your travel plan, as this place have a good value of learning history and a few minimart for you to shop and for eating place you can go near by coffee shop and have a cup of tea and so on."
,,Nirvana..!,4.0,,Having been to various Buddhist Temples in India...this was a must visit site for me personally. Went there sunday morning when about 100 followers were praying in a recital. The joy and inner peace that one gets is something to be experienced. Must visit when in Chinatown.
,,So happy,5.0,,I visited on Vesak. As a Buddhist I enjoyed the rituals but also can recommend the temple and its museums. It is an amazing plCe and I spent two very happy hours here.
,,Colourful,4.0,,"This is a 'working' temple for locals. Though you are welcome to walk through and take photographs, you will also see local worshipers making offerings so be respectful. I liked the richness of the decoration and the pragmatic feel of the place. It's set in the middle of Chinatown, right next to a market so a bustling setting rather than a serene one but very attractive."
,,More than just a pretty building,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is beautiful, yes, but it's more than that. Unlike most other temples in SE Asia, this one is also a museum. On one of the levels (I forget now, but the signs are easy to read and figure out), there are relics of the Buddha's disciples, wax figures of Buddhists, and other cool sculptures and old photographs of what Singapore (specifically Chinatown) used to look like back in the day.

There are also services you can watch (and hear), but I'm not sure the times. I'm guessing you can ask someone when you're there, as the staff members were smiley and therefore likely helpful. It's free to enter, and if you're wearing ""inappropriate"" clothing (short-sleeve shirts, shorts, short skirts, etc.), they have sarongs and scarves you can borrow (for free) while you walk around."
,,Interesting,4.0,,A huge temple with lots to see. There was a service on during our visit which added to the atmosphere of the temple. Make a trip up to the roof garden & spin the prayer wheel.
,,Business trip of husband,4.0,,This Was a great place. 1000dragon hall and several budha statues were a sight. One of a kind. Very peaceful
,,"Beautiful Place, easy quick stop in China Town",4.0,,"Beautiful building with amazing sculptures. Workers are pleasant, even during ceremonies. I always enjoy bringing my family members here when they are visiting Singapore (and China Town)."
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"The temple and museum are definitely worth a visit. I have been there twice, I will definitely visit there more often. I love everything of it."
,,Beautiful Buddhist Temple,5.0,,This was my first visit to a Buddhist temple. I must say it was the best place among all the places visited in Singapore. This is place just 4-5 mins walk from Mariamma temple in China town. Its well maintained and has rest rooms in the Museum on 3rd floor. The architecture and colors used were brilliant.
,,Stunning temple,5.0,,"This is the most beutiful Chinese temple I have ever visited in Asia. The place stunning and spotlessly clean, everything looks brand new!"
,,A Grand Entrance,3.0,,An enriching visit to this cultural and religious site - did not understand everything but the place depicts a rich grandeur of worship
,,Very very nice temple,5.0,,"Very beautiiful, clean and nice temple. It is very prepared for the visitors so they make it easy and nice to visit and be there."
,,Vibrant colours,4.0,,"Busy yet peaceful. The temple is full of ornate statues, wall plaques, flowers and filled with the smell of incense and the sound if chanting.
Shoulders must be covered as a mark of respect. There is a lift to the top floor where the relic is housed behind glass in a large room where there are comfortable areas for those who wish to meditate.
A spectacular visual attraction for which there is no charge but donations are appreciated."
,,Ornate and peaceful,4.0,,This temple is quite modern but is beautiful inside. I know next to nothing about Buddhism but I was impressed with the intricate carved figures in both the main hall and in the entrance. Well worth going to if you're in the Chinatown area.
,,A great experience - make sure you see all 5 floors,5.0,,"I came upon this following the Lonely Planet Chinatown walk and could have stayed there for hours. It's a living, breathing spiritual centre, monks and nuns chanting, many thousands of Buddhas around the walls - and that's just the ground floor. The bumper sized prayer wheel on the roof is a treat, and on 4th floor you can see the relic itself. It all felt very authentic. Plus they will lend you coverings for your legs if your hem length is above the knee in a very easy, welcoming,non-judgmental kind of a way. There are also cards with simple explanations of various things in English which help. Lots of gold and silk. Beautiful."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,"Although built in a traditional style, this is quite a modern building. However, it is a spectacular looking temple both inside and out. The interior walls are lined with thousands of miniature statues of Buddha, all slightly different. There are some amazing large statues on a raised podium. There is no charge to enter. Unfortunately, there is nothing to indicate access to the upper floors, so we did not get to see the museum or Buddha's tooth."
,,colourful and busy temple,4.0,,colourful and busy temple just off the street .. beautiful decor and a great atmosphere. not a big temple but well worth a visit
,,Trip to Asia June 2015,4.0,,Very nice temple to visit. I've been in some temples in China and Hong Kong and this one is really outstanding. The amount of budas around the room is incredible. Very peaceful and good to make a stop and think in life.
,,Humbling experience,5.0,,Beautiful temple in the heart of chinatown opposite the food market. A serene experience walking through the chambers especially when the monks and local people are at prayer. Just remember to show respect by dressing in an appropriate manner and not talking loudly
,,Amazing detail and very welcoming,4.0,,"First time to the temple, the detail of the idols was amazing, there was a large group reading in unison, unique experience"
,,fascinating,5.0,,Charming place. I went after work so i couldn't see inside. So go here before 5pm at least. I was passing here on my way to chinatown. I like the night view of out side. The architecture and lantern make a fabulous scenery amidst the city.
,,Impressive and gorgeously built,5.0,,"If you're wearing shorts or short skirts don't worry you can still go in, there are shawls to cover your arms or legs. There is no entry fee another great thing compared to most temples in Thailand. Once inside it feels like in a different world, it's quiet and peaceful compared to the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. Go all the way up by elevator and enjoy the garden at the last floor with the huge prayer wheel. It's just a great spot to run away from the craziness of the city. Also don't miss out on the room with the buddha tooth, you can just sit there and mediate for hours while resting your body from the heat outside."
,,beautiful visit,5.0,,"Second time to singapore, and second visit to the temple. Its always a clean and peaceful visit. You feel instantly welcomed and its worth checking out if you are a fan of temples in any way"
,,The must see in Chinatown,5.0,,If visitors by Singapore this place is a must see. Truly impressive. Also no entrance fee. The best collection of Buddhas anywhere. Amazing
,,impressing place which you should not miss on your china town tour,5.0,,The temple is easy to find when you walk through china town. Go inside and walk around up to the top floor. The museum is rather interesting and worth a visit.
,,Visited during festivities and got a treat!,5.0,,"The sounds, smells, visuals = all intense!!! Can't begin to relate with any true insight what was actually happening or taking place - but it was a delight!! (Ladies - there are shalls to cover your bare arms in a basket to one side at the entrance - employ and return)"
,,Excellent temple,4.0,,"The temple is very easy to find from the Chinatown MRT and close to the maxwell hawker centre.

If you want to go inside the temple you must wear bottoms below the knee otherwise you can borrow a sarong from the temple.

You get visiti the second and third floor of the temple. Not sure if you need to pay a fee for this."
,,"Fascinating, well worth a visit.",5.0,,"What an interesting place!
The outside is beautiful and while the inside with the big golden Buddha in the middle and the many smaller Buddhas on the walls is a little overwhelming at first, it is also quite beautiful.
The peace & quiet and subtle scent of burning incense inside is a stark contrast to the smells and hustle & bustle of Chinatown outside.
When we visited we saw part of a ceremony or service, with monks chanting and members of the public praying. It was very interesting to watch.
Being a place of worship do ensure that you dress respectfully with shoulders and knees covered (no shorts & singlets please). They do provide some simple wraps if required."
,,A calming place,5.0,,"A beautiful temple locate near Chinatown, with stunning architecture. Well worth a visit even if you are not a buddhist."
,,"A. It of everything - food, history, temples, culture",5.0,,Really beautiful architecture. You don't have to be Buddhist to visit. But do dress decently as they might have you put on a sarong before you enter. I am in awe of the outside and inside of the temple. Lots to learn. Take time to wonder around the top floors. Right smack in the middle of Chinatown. You can also hit the Indian temple just few hundred meters away to Duxton Hill for some drinking and good food and music in the evening after wondering around Chinatown in the afternoon. Opposite the road there is the Maxwell Food Court where overseas tourist can try all the local food that Singaporeans have on a daily basis.
,,If in Chinatown ...,4.0,,"There are a few floors, and some interesting exhibits. Prayer beads and the like can be purchased on the main floor; these are more expensive than similar items you'll see in various shops in Chinatown, but the idea is that part of this money is a donation. Possibly you're getting some better quality also.

I've dropped in to the Temple a couple of times on trips to Singapore. Mainly because I usually go to Chinatown and have some Black Pepper Crab (cheaper than in Clarke Quay, for example, but more expensive than in Little Thailand.) Then I'll sit back under an awning, have a Tiger, and wait for the rain to stop.

I don't think that I'd go out of my way if I wasn't already in Chinatown. But, if you're only going to be in Singapore once, go to Chinatown, and to the Temple."
,,Fantastic Place,5.0,,A must do in S'Pore! Take the elevator to the top and work your way down. We were very lucky - the day we went the Priests were doing a chant to bless the books of temple goers.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Great place, calming even when busy. Take the time to start at the top floor and walk down each level taking in the history of Buddishm and a relic of the Budda . Just outside is a paradise for people washing, especially the chess players by the Chinatown Visitor Centre."
,,Good for a quick drop-in while walking around China Town,3.0,,"I live around this area and have walked by this temple many times. Inside there is a mid-size golden Buddha. The center area is roped off for worshipers to practice their belief. Tourist can walk around the edges to get a closer look.

If you're travelling to Singapore, I wouldn't make this a ""go-to"" location. It is more of a quick drop-in while you tour around China Town."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Filled with thousands of Buddha figures this temple is unbelievable and has to be seen. To me it appeared to be more of a tourist attraction than a place of worship I still enjoyed the experience.
Be sure to wear appropriate clothing or you'll be asked to get a cloth to cover up. Definitely worth a visit."
,,A piece of history amongst the high rises,5.0,,The building & artwork inside is colourful & inspiring. You need to cover your knees & shoulders however they have free wraps available for use (to cover both knees & shoulders). Free entry. Friendly staff. Worth visiting while you're in Chinatown.
,,authentic and open to public,5.0,,"Visitors could see the activities of the monks and people who prays inside. It open to public at particular hours. The architecture is beautiful, oriental, and authentic. It is well-preserved and easy to reach as its location is in Chinatown"

,,Chinatown landmark,4.0,,"The temple located near Chinatown. the architecture was stunning. good location to take your picture. Because this is basically a place to pray, you need to keep quiet and dress properly (no short pants for example)"
,,Spiritual,5.0,,So beautiful. This is an incredibly spiritual place to visit. I was in AWE. I highly recommend that you make this a MUST on your visit to Singapore.
,,you may not be buddist but this this is for your sole,5.0,,"early morning and i mean early,the chanting of the monks is how can i explain it is trueley moving a feeling of peace and contentment ,you will not mind missing a late arising for the sheer feelings i know you will leave with.Not to be missed."
,,Interesting place in Chinatown,4.0,,"Just round the corner from Tanjong Pagar MTR, it is a large Buddhist temple. The ground floor has a large prayer hall but do go to the 5th Floor rooftop garden, where you have the world's largest prayer wheel."
,,A place to go!,4.0,,This is a very big temple. Entrance is free and you get to visit the 7 floors and the rooftop garden. Lots of statues and relics inside. This is a must do when in Chinatown.
,,Elegant Buddhist temple,4.0,,"A feast for the eyes & soul. Especially if you are Buddhist, but even if not, you will never forget your visit."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Loved it ... Please get a local guide out the front of the temple to show you through .. A man came up to me and asked if he could show me through .. Excellent when I asked how much after the tour he said free .... So maybe a donation to the temple for good karma.
,,Buddhist temple that is also a museum,4.0,,"Liked:
-Modern temple with interesting museum like display of Buddha's life and teaching, in a 1st person narrative.
- All free
- Nearby are Hindu Temple and Islamic Mosque worth visiting for comparison.
- Be sure to go to roof to turn the large prayer wheel
Dislike
- can be very crowded
- if you do not want to wear (on loan from the temple) hot wraps to cover your body wear clothing that covers at least your knees and your shoulders.
When in Singapore, and especially if in Chinatown, a must do."
,,peaceful,4.0,,"nice and quiet place, small but definitely worth wile visiting. note that it closes at 7pm and last admission to upper level is before 6pm"
,,Beautifully kept temple,3.0,,"Beautifully kept temple and well worth seeing, nice reprieve from the heat and traffic.The ceiling and walls are very well decorated"

,,Interesting visit,5.0,,Found this very interesting. Wanted to see some of the culture of Singapore old so visited here. Very interesting with some great commentary around the palace and loved how it is a in use temple. Many people using it.
,,Awesome Temple,5.0,,"We had no expectations on visiting the Temple as I hadn't read much on it but it was an amazingly calming and quiet place in the middle of the noise of Chinatown. It is free to enter, but you feel the need to donate to them for the brilliant displays they have there. We were also lucky enough to be blessed so this was a further donation, but we were more than happy to pay"
,,"Awesome place if you're truly spiritual, a must see!",5.0,,"Even if you're not spiritual it's worth a visit because there's so much history here about Buddhism and its origin. If you're not interested in any of those then go because you can feel the good vibe, a positive energy surrounding you. There's a place to mediate to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. If visiting this temple please be respectful and dress conservatively, no tank tops and no mini skirts. Also be prepared to take off your shoes in certain areas."
,,Great and calming place,5.0,,"Spare 10-15 minutes listening to chanting and meditating is great. It has exhibits, galleries and garden up there too."
,,In the heart of Chinatown,4.0,,A place for worship _()_ Very central location. Not to be missed if you are in Chinatown areas. Nice place to see around.
,,Beautiful and very welcoming,4.0,,"I went on Vesak Day, so it was understandably quite busy. I asked for permission to take photos first, and the people in the front office told me that it was ok except on the upper floors where there are clearly posted signs. The worshippers were fine with non-worshippers admiring their beautiful temple. The postings which explain the various gods are written in multiple languages, so you can use this visit as an opportunity to learn more. Highly recommended!"
,,A true delight,5.0,,I was on a soulful journey last month and I am glad I found his place. I sat there for hours on 3rd floor. It was extremely peaceful. Do not miss the roof top!
,,A huge Buddhist temple in Chinatown.,4.0,,"When we visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, it was festive as it was Vesak Day. There was a lion dance troupe that was performing. It was very crowded as expected on Vesak Day, but it was orderly.

Ladies whose attires did not cover their shoulders were gently reminded to cover up before entering the temple. Shawls were available for these purposes at no charge.

The building is huge, and you can spend some time exploring. Interestingly, the same stretch of road is home to a mosque and a Hindu temple, and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is more recently established, compared to Masjid Jamae which was established in back in 1826."
,,Fantastic Museum,5.0,,"Getting here, exit at Chinatown then go straight. It's located within Chinatown.

The Museum has spectacular display of their Buddha or gods. The art are so eccentric and detailed. Truly amazing. We spent more than an hour in the museum because of its art and beauty. We also had a little understanding of the religion.

At their souvenir shop, we also got some coins as souvenir or luck.. As they say.. Guys from the shop ;)

I strongly recommend a visit in this museum."
,,Number one recommendation.,5.0,,"I did not know what to expect but was completely stunned by the beauty of this temple in Chinatown. From the large community room downstairs to the room of 1000 Buddhas( more like 10,000 I believe) in the garden on the roof, my mind was blown. You must go upstairs to the actual shrine ... Magnificent. Free entrance but please give a donation ... Especially if you take some of their literature away. Dress respectfully or expect to be given a shawl and sarong, but just make time to go there. It is a MUST SEE for sure!"
,,Golden Buddha Shrine,4.0,,"The only thing to say is go and see this impressive temple and it's story. Situated in Chinatown It is easy to locate and get to. Be blessed at the shrine on the top floor after viewing the golden tooth, largest prayer wheel in the world and listen to the chanting on the ground floor. Literature to be had to study afterwards."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"its really nice, make sure that you go up too, the 4th floor garden, the 3th floor the relic and the second floor museum and the first floor the temple, very interesting, if you enjoy could spend a half day just reading and taking pictures,very nice"
,,a not to be missed temple in Singapore,5.0,,"we were touring Chinatown and had walked past the Mosque and Hindu temple, many shops, etc. until we came upon the impressive Buddha Tooth Relic temple. It is rather large. Monks were praying inside. The interior is amazing. You are allowed to take photos and look around. There is a great deal to see and take in. This is a peaceful place where you can enjoy the tranquility"
,,Worth a visit for both religious and not so religious ones!,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a treat to your eyes. The unassuming exteriors lead to a magnificent tranquilizing interior with Buddha idol and hundreds of monks chanting around it. Don't forget to pick up some great handouts on Buddhism. The other side of the temple takes you to the shopping street where all your Singapore souvenirs needs would be met with some really interesting stuff all around. The parallel street is the Chinatown food street - go for some great chicken satay, duck and a range of street food!"
,,Temple,5.0,,We had a trip to the temple which was quite a site to see the building are kept quite clean and is very quite place there is a very large statue of the Buddha but you can not go right uo close to it
,,One of its kind,4.0,,"This temple is very beautiful from outside and inside. Constant chanting in the temple is very soothing. It is near Chinatown and a small market area, so after spending a good time here, shopping can be continued.
If interested in temples and Buddhist culture, must visit."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,I really liked the solemnity of the place. It was so peaceful inside. We prayed there even if we are Catholics.

,,Brand new temple,5.0,,"Beautifully sited on the edge of Chinatown next to rows of colorful shop houses in contrast with dense modern skyscrapers of the CBD district, the temple itself is simply a magnificent work of architecture."
,,Nice Temple,5.0,,It is located in China Town and is unlike any other Buddhist temple I have been too. There were various forms of buddha on all walls of the temple. It was pretty amazing to look.
,,Magnificent Temple,4.0,,"Located in the China Town area of Singapore is the Buddah Tooth Relic Temple. It is easy to locate due to its impressive architecture and intricate architectural detail. On our visit we walked through the temple and saw many tourists and many practicing Buddhists. The religious artefacts and artistic detail were impressive. On hand were a number of temple guardians and staff to ensure appropriate behaviour. Clothing is available at entry points to ensure appropriate dress standards are maintained (clothing to cover knees at least and no uncovered shoulders, stomachs etc). The temple is well worth a visit with no entry fee charged, though donations are accepted. A small gift shop is located in one corner. If you are visiting China Town then a visit to the temple would be worthwhile. We did not take any tour and we did not visit any museum section on this occasion."
,,In Awe....,5.0,,"From an empty lot into a majestic Temple!!!
This lot used to house the dead in coffins....those were the days back in 1950s.... When the building of this temple was finished, I was totally engrossed with the majestic looks of it, how tall and how elaborately it was done. The intricate interior architecture is loud in colors, which is typical of any Chinese Temples. But I do enjoy walking through it. Several times I was there, I was able to catch the monks praying for some special occasions. It's never a dull moment there. I would definitely recommend to pay a visit."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"We visited this interesting Chinese Temple. While we were there they had a 'service' in progress which meant a lot a chanting and drum beating. It was so interesting to see! The tooth relic is quite small and behind glass and quite secure, but it is beautiful and worth seeing. Definitely recommended!"
,,Photography hotshot,5.0,,"One of my favorite photography walkaround spot. Get soak into the peaceful and holy environment, and feel your creativity soar. Once outside, the crowd is generally of the older generation. See them praying or explore the cool building and studd."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A very beautiful place with lots of Buddha sculptures, you can also enjoy the architecture of Asian temple. It took a while from the MRT."
,,A devotional centre for old and young people,4.0,,"The Buddha tooth Relic Temple was filled with devoted people chanting and praying and it was very much a living experience to watch these devotees in action. The Buddha
tooth was upstairs and we were encouraged to file past the relic . The gardens on the top story of the building were also a quiet area for reflection."
,,Very spiritual,5.0,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is just beautiful. It is a pretty big and tall building. There are two levels open to the visitors. They will ask you to cover up if you are showing too much skin. Coverups are available at both entrances. We were there when monks and other people were praying. It was a pretty amazing experience.
,,Nice,4.0,,Nice Buddhist temple easily accessible from Chinatown or the Singapore River area. Temple is nice and looks very new. Very crowded when I was there.
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,5.0,,"Rising up in the heart of Chinatown is the the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. Step inside and be humbled by the chants and prayers of the buddhist monks. Be overwhelmed by the rich, ornate details all around, the wood carving, the gold deities, the tiles on the roof. Each statue a representation of the buddhist philosophies and way of life. Engrossed you will be in the simplistic way of life. Find your way to the Garden roof top and leave a blessing at the gigantic prayer wheel - here you will find peace. Be respectful of the Culture by ensuring you follow the dress code. Shawls are provided for those that need to be covered across their arms, waist or chest."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"You were made to feel very, very welcome. You do need to be covered ladies, no legs or shoulders on show; they do provide skirt wraps and shawls though. The chanting and prayers five times a day, oh what dedication. Very helpful people to guide you through your visit."
,,A humbling experience,5.0,,"This temple is truly amazing, yet humbling at the same time. it is well worth the hour or so to explore all available floors and the Tooth relic is a must see. Be aware that a dress code applies. For men shorts must be knee length or longer and take off your hat. Ladies you can visit wearing shorts and tops but will be asked to wear a light shawl and ""sarong"".. which is loaned to you at entrance"
,,Best Buddha Temple,5.0,,We were fortunate to experience the mass prayer. It is such a beautiful template. The three temples in the main temple area are just incomparable.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"We were ""adopted"" by an ""official"" within moments of arriving and suddenly found ourselves on our own private tour. We were very wary at first and really not comfortable with how the situation left our control - having said that - we actually learnt a lot from the man who showed us around and by the end of it all we were wanting to tip him! We both got the impression at the end of the tour that he would have walked away without causing a problem if we didn't tip but he really did add to our visit and we were happy to compensate him."
,,"very atmostpheric & colourful, with opportunity to light incence & pray for loved ones",5.0,,"Visually stunning, with opportunity to meditate & pray if you wish & to feel a part of a busy & beautiful temple; Close to a delicious vegetarian restaurant & of course the colourful area of China town"
,,Divine Experience,5.0,,"Tooth relic temple is a must see for both believers as well as non-believers. Located amidst the bustling streets of China town, tooth relic temple offers a divine experience for veryone. Best time to visit is during the prayer time, when the symphonic chanting by the priests provide an out of the world experience. Ladies must avoid wearing sleeveless and men must wear trousers (avoid shorts)"
,,Loved it.,5.0,,Make sure you go to the garden on the roof - it has a massive prayer wheel that is a must see. Loved all of the history of Buddha written as you walked through. Well worth a visit.
,,Chinese temple,4.0,,"Bang in Middle of china town - Walk up through alleys between several kiosks - Don't forget to collect Roasted chest nuts, Chinese curios & also Chinese Calligraphy laminated prints of your names ( Cost us SGD 15 per piece after haggling)
Dont miss the museum/prayer hall on 4th flr & roof top garden - small but nice photo ops"
,,great art,5.0,,One should visit this place to behold art in its religious context. The colors are amazing. BE mindfully respectful as well during your visit.
,,Must visit if interested in learning about Buddha!,5.0,,"I was completely bowled over by the magnificent statues in the temple and the grandeur of it all. There are a thousand Buddha statues in little niches around the hall.

Also happened to witness the monks offering prayers which was enchanting.
We did not have time to visit all four levels but saving it for the next visit."
,,amazing,4.0,,very busy but how amazing. Very easy to get to and great to look around. Definately recommend a look.
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"I only came in the last 10 minutes and it was a real shame as I was really enjoying what was on display and wanted to read more, I managed to take a few photos but feel I missed out by not coming in earlier."
,,Better with a guide,4.0,,My guide gave me insights into the quirks and features of this fascinating place. Worth a visit with some notes or a guide!
,,Beautiful Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"Each floor of this temple had interesting displays and beautiful meditation and prayer areas, culminating with the tooth relic on the 4th floor. We really enjoyed wandering around this amazing temple."
,,"Informative, peaceful and beautiful",5.0,,"This wonderful temple is also a lovely informative museum that teaches you start to end about Buddhism. It's peaceful and unique. Had a great mediation room along with beautiful artwork and space. Definitely visit if you enjoy temples, art, spirituality or exploring. Shanti"
,,where learn about buddhism,5.0,,"This place is a gem in the city. You have to see every floor of the temple. The roof has a garden and the pagoda of the ten thousand buddhas, on the fourth floor has a museum about Buddha's life, the third floor has a gallery, on the second the view front the top of the temple and on the ground the temple itself. All Wonderful! Do not miss!"
,,Peaceful Oasis in Chinatown,4.0,,"A beautiful place to visit. Its very calm and peaceful, and a very interesting exhibitions of the life od the Buddha and Buddhism. The exquisite arts on the walls and ceilings was amazing. Definitely worth a visit. Very educational and gave me a renewed understanding of the religion."
,,"Not a ""must visit"" but quaint and easy to get to.",4.0,,"The temple is nice but not exactly awe inspiring, particularly if you have travelled around Asia. It is located on the edge of Chinatown so it is no effort to get to and the entry is free. You can purchase incense or small offerings for a small price. Women are required to cover their shoulders and above the knee with sarongs which are available at the right hand entrance to the naim temple."
,,Interesting Museum & Roof Garden,4.0,,Place is peaceful and 1000 of buddha statues. Museum is on 2nd floor. Worth giving a visit when you're in Chinatown. After that you can cross the road for food at Maxwell foodcourt!
,,Very spritual,3.0,,"This temple is beautiful and very uplifting. Girl can't wear short shorts or skirts or singlets, and boys must wear knee length shorts or longer. They do have cloths to cover up if you do come with the short clothing. Its very nice and good idea to go have a look if you are in the area"
,,Beautiful building,4.0,,"Well worth a trip to see something different and more ""local"" in Singapore. Beautiful inside and out."
,,Unusual,5.0,,This is an unusual museum and I found it very interesting to see the different Buddhas . I thought there was only one but each country has a different Buddha.
,,buddah buddah buddah,4.0,,"Worth the donation entry, may pay to get a guide if you want to understand it, otherwise just be taken in by the buddah display"
,,Pretty Buddhist Temple in China Town,4.0,,"This is a typical Buddhist temple, but some of the main large Buddha statues are the nicest I have seen. Being right on the edge of China Town, it is certainly worth a look before you roam the streets shopping for trinkets."
,,Impressive,4.0,,The temple was really fascinating. It had over 100 Buddha statues. There were so many things to see and everything seemed so shiny.
,,BRILLIANT - One of the best things we saw in Sri Lanka - Get a guide!,5.0,,It was very very busy and hot on the day we went but well worth it. As soon as you get into the temple it is much cooler - for the equivalent of around $5-6 USD a tour guide will tell you everything you need to know. It is fascinating - our tour guide was a wonderful (around 80 years old) man who had been working at the temple for years and could manage the stairs much better than us! I think it is not worth doing unless you get a guide - well worth a visit.
,,Religious but not informatic,4.0,,When I was there a prayer was happening. The order and art work there was fascinating and very sheik. Everything was great but there was not that kind of informercial system I was looking for about the nature and bases of the monuments and paintings.
,,Nicely built and maintained,4.0,,Buddha Tooth Relic temple is situated right next to China Town Market and is a marvel piece of art work.
,,A Must see in Chinatown,4.0,,"We asked a local for location as we seemed to get ourselves a little lost in the laneways of Chinatown. Lovely man who not only gave us instructions on how to get there, but made sure we visited the 4th floor. Make sure you go up to the roof top garden too, tranquility!"
,,Place of Solace,4.0,,I'm not a Buddhist but stepping inside the temple made me feel so much at peace. Find some time to visit this place and learn more about Buddhist culture and history.
,,A must see,5.0,,Beautiful temple with inviting staff . Hundreds of budhas line the perimeter with colorful ornamentation surroundings.
,,A good place for seclusion,3.0,,"An eye opener of this modern temple which includes a museum in it. Also fully air-conditioned and very well organised. A very peaceful and quiet place for meditation, chanting and doing self prayers. Even there is a security guard there to assist the tourists and devotees in case help is needed. All are welcome and no need registration. Even children accompanied by their parents are visiting the temple too. It is a four storey building. On top of that there is a roof top garden with pretty flowers blooming everywhere. I was really amazed with their giant prayer wheel. There are also temple staff acting as tourist guides to explain the history of the temple and the life of the Buddha. Its really a great quiet place for tourists, devotees and families BUT be quiet at all times to respect the place and devotees doing their prayers."
,,Beautifully made,5.0,,"A great huge temple with several floors, almost a musuem with some old relics and artefacts. Great veggie place in the basement for some light lunch. Must visit"
,,A must place to visit,5.0,,"The temple is beautifully decorated with red and gold everywhere. It has a serenity that takes over you as you walk around. Scarfs are available to borrow free of charge to follow the Buddhist way as you enter. From the moment you step in, the calmness of the temple surrounds you. It is a gallery walk way that goes around the main room where the monks are actively meditating. The sounds of their chants echo perfectly around the room. At the very top of the temple is a peaceful garden where you can sit and contemplate life for yourself. The temple houses what is thought to be siddarthas tooth. Cameras are allowed but without a flash and they ask you be discreet.
A wonderful place to visit and I highly recommend this."
,,Venerable,4.0,,"This place has fantastic architecture and is a credit to those who have preserved it throughout the ages. Also as it is a temple of worship it is real and not a symbol, rather an ongoing icon to the belief. Very definately worth the visit if you are already ib the Chinatown area. Lots to see in and around."
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum can be reached from China-Town MRT on the junction of Sago Road and South bridge road. It is a grand designed Tang-Styled Chinese Buddhist Temple. It houses the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic and some other sacred relics of the Buddha, such as bone and tongue relics.

You will also find here the Buddhist Culture Museum, Eminent Sangha Museum, Sacred Light Hall, and a Theater which holds cultural performances, talks and film screening. You should visit all the floors of the temple to know it fully. (Use elevator )

Viewing of BuddhaTooth Relic is Daily from 9am - 6pm;Buddhist Culture Museum Daily from 9am - 6pm; and Eminent Sangha Museum Daily from 7am - 7pm. Admission is free. You are required wear appropriate attire- no bare backs, off-shoulders, shorts, mini-skirts, etc. Non-vegetarian food and pets are not allowed inside the Temple. You can go with your shoes on. Photography is freely permitted. A must visit to appreciate."
,,Peaceful yet active temple with lessons in reading sciptures!,5.0,,A must see in Singapore. Beautiful articheture and design inside with nicely decorated statues. What gave it a special touch was its active use and many people from the community also visiting with some learning how to read sciptures.
,,Weird feeling on the story of Buddha told in first person prespective,3.0,,"Great vegetarian food, recommended to try.

Nice setup and world class artefacts and arts pieces on display. Hall is air conditioned and a very good respite from the heat outside. Good to visit anytime of the day during open hours.

A pleasant and beautiful small orchid and flower garden at the roof top is so pretty and photogenic.

This is also the first time that I have visited a museum that told the story of Buddha in first person perspective. This is unique is not weird as typically Buddhism teaching is not putting a high emphasis of the life story of Buddha compare to his teachings and the content of sutra.

But overall a good introduction of Buddhism for first timer. Very museum like plus some religious area. Recommended."
,,Just Amazing!,5.0,,"The people here are very knowledgeable and keen to tell you the stories of Buddha and Buddhism. We were very lucky and got to see Buddha's tooth. There are 5 in the world and this is the only one that is allowed to be viewed by the public for just 3 days in the year. Look into the dates if you'd like to see the tooth or you'll be disappointed.

The temple is very nice inside with the different gold Buddha's. Even if you're not religious or from a different religion you'll be welcome here and impressed with the inside and history. The only part I'd say and it's not absolutely clear is there are several floors to explore, I would never have known unless one of the staff had told us about Buddha's tooth on the 4th floor."
,,Great place to visit whlist in Chinatown,4.0,,"You don't have to be religious to visit, and all are welcome in this tranquil building in which I'm sure you'll show respect. Realistically it's quite stunning, and the roof garden with the ""wishing/praying wheel"" particularly soothing. To go up floors go to the right at main entrance and find lifts and stairs. Surrounded by Chinese markets which are well worthy of investigation too. Look out for Singaporian coffee (kope?) shops closeby as real good."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. Easy to reach from The China town MRT station. Talk a walk through the markets in that area too. They also have a vegetarian restaurant but we were too late to try it, as the restaurant closes at 3pm."
,,Oasis of Tranquility,5.0,,"In the middle of busy China Town ...this is a beautiful, tranquil and sacred buddhist temple that covers 5 floors with relics, statues, museum and roof garden. Nice to sit and be at peace with yourself as you listen to the monks chanting at certain times of the day. Can easily spend a couple of hours as you take in the story of Buddha and look at the relics. Light an incense stick, say a prayer and calm you mind. Make sure you are in respectful and suitable attire. A must-see on your list if ever in Singapore."
,,Great!,5.0,,"We went here twice for photoclub and Geo Investigation and both times I visited the temple. It's a lovely place, extremely modern with modern features hidden cleverly in the beautiful design."
,,Good visit,4.0,,"It is hard to visit this part of the world and not have a fair share of temples. When visiting this one, make sure you make it up to the upper floors and see the wonderful gold room. There was some free literature on Buddhism on the way out. I found it interesting read later that evening."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Gorgeous Temple filled with buddhas. We happened to be there when the monks were chanting and praying and it was very interesting. Just so much to look at in this beautiful place. They also have several books about Buddhism that are available for the taking as you leave.
,,Inspiring and insightful,5.0,,"Working Buddhist temple with lots of monks praying. Each floor has something to offer. The ground floor is often very busy, with hundreds of Buddhas lining the walls and people praying in the main room. Amazing to see all the offerings. The top floor is very peaceful and you can turn the giant wheel to gain merit. The museum is also worth viewing for the story Buddha and statues from around the world. And of course there's the tooth relic... Incased in gold. Very impressive indeed."
,,Worth the Visit,5.0,,"Very interesting view into another Religion, as a prayer session was on when I attended. Shop sells usual items which seems to me to be expensive. The Temple is the reason to be there, and Chinatown is just outside the door with all that has to offer."
,,Go upstairs,4.0,,"It's a beautiful main floor, bit it seems like nobody was bothered with seeing the upstairs galleries. Wonderful collection of artifacts and givfts to the temple, plus a history of the temple and details of the past masters."
,,Even nicer inside than outside,5.0,,"Great place, clean, even nicer inside than outside but you have to be very lucky if you want to take a picture from the outside as tourists buses are parked in front on a continuous basis (theoretically parking is not permitted but surprisingly enough, you are in Singapore, this is not enforced by the police) - Visited the area 4 times during our stay, we could not take any clean picture from the outside, always a bus :-("
,,Beautiful temple in Chinatown area,4.0,,This is one of the most important Buddhist temple on the island. Is a good break while shopping in Chinatown.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Make sure you take the time to stop by this lovely temple and see all the statues and other artefacts and savour the atmosphere. Free entry but,donations are welcome. Very welcoming."
,,More than I thought,5.0,,Interesting place for tourist and worshipper. Big massive temple with few floors to explore. Nice exhibition on the the tooth relic and stories of Buddhism. Good place to visit and good food around the areas.
,,Lots of chanting,4.0,,our visit coincided with a period of chanting which gave some real life to a very well preserved and beautiful building
,,Lots to see,5.0,,"The BTRT is located near the Chinatown MRT and shops. Its first floor consists of a large prayer room with 1000 unique Buddhas on the side walls. As non-Buddhists, we enjoyed looking for the subtle or not-so-subtle differences between the 1000. The backroom has the guardians for each Chinese zodiac (some were combined, such as dragon and snake sharing one). This was a great introduction to the protector guardians. The actual tooth relic is on the 4th floor in a pure gold stupa. You can't really see it because it is enclosed in multiple gold containers and kept behind glass (for twice a year, it is moved up to the glass). There were two cameras which showed you the tooth being held by an apparatus which should satisfy general curiosity. The museum displays on the 2rd and 3rd floors were quite impressive, although at times it was not clear whether something was antique or a contemporary reproduction. There is also a vegetarian meal served under the temple but we did not have time to go. Overall, plan on spending 2-3 hours there if you want to look at everything."
,,Lots and lots of Buddhas,4.0,,Wish I had more time to look at all the Buddhas. The art work is beautiful and it was fun trying to find your own birthstone Buddha. Many people were praying in front of their Buddha.
,,A lot of buddhas!,4.0,,"There were certainly a lot of buddhas in the temple and museum, but it was interesting and very peaceful."
,,Unexpected haven of peace.,4.0,,Nestled within the crazy and hectic life that is Singapore is this magnificent Temple. Step inside and you are transported into an entirely different world. Light an incense stick and find your inner calm.
,,Large well presented pergola with golden Buddhas inside,4.0,,Bustling temple filled with incense and activity. Go light a stick of incense and you will feel peace at once
,,Highly ornate temple ... gold everywhere ...,4.0,,"This has to be a must see when in Singapore's Chinatown. Confusing in the extreme to someone like me who knows little about the religion; but quite something to view for free. Visitors are welcome to explore several floors of the building - there is a lift, the main exhibit is on the 4th floor where you will have to remove shoes."
,,Must see attraction - Free,4.0,,Out of the few free attractions in Singapore.. Beautiful temple.. Visited with my family.. You can take the MRT and get down from China town and walk your way about 800m to the temple..
,,Interesting to see form inside,4.0,,"I got to this place by accident, but I am happy that I could see this from inside. Interesting to see, nice to walk around. Ladies have to cover the shoulders."
,,Pleasant temple,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit to this temple, we were surprised to learn that it was built in 2005.
The staff were friendly, there was no cost to visit (shorts/short skirts/bare shoulders not allowed). Beautifully decorated. multiple levels able to be visited, appeared to be a popular tourist attraction.

Right next to Chinatown shopping area (cheap souvenirs). Worth the visit."
,,Part of an organised trip,5.0,,"Beautiful, dramatic buildings with stunning dragon carvings on the hips of the roofs , well planted and tended gardens and such gentle and generous people."
,,temple to visit,3.0,,"a well kept temple, easy access for tourist. next to chinatown. i go there everytime while visiting chinatown"
,,One of the places to visit when in Chinatown!,4.0,,"Being first-timer here, I thought I can't enter the temple unless I wear a specific dress code. But I was able to roam around while taking a pic. The place is so solemn even myself a non-buddhist can claim that this is a sacred place. Drop by in this temple when you're in Chinatown!"
,,interesting and informative,4.0,,"The temple is actually very big(four stories). It was very informative. For the first time, as a non buddhist I learned about the life of Buddha. Try to visit the roof garden."
,,Budhist Temple Chinatown,5.0,,we visited the temple the week Lee Kwan Yu passed away & it was packed with people paying their respects. Although crowded it was beautifully decorated with floral tributes & the chanting of the monks made it very special. Do go up to the second floor where the displays & exhibits are excellent. No charge either!
,,Very good!,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a very charming place in the heart of the Chinese quarter, called also China Town. I had the luck of being present at a ceremony at the Temple and it was magnificient!"
,,Nice temple with full bown AC,4.0,,"We stumble upon this temple when we're visiting China town. The only reason we went in was because they have full-blown AC. As seen, this temple is very well funded, with gold and glimmer decorating the walls, and everyone in the temple enjoying the AC. It's a very pretty temple to visit if you're around the corner, and of course to escape from the heat."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A beautiful Buddhist temple in the heart of Chinatown. Note that there is a strict dress code for entering the temple. If you are a female and wearing a sleeveless top, you will be given a scarf at the entrance to cover your shoulders, but if you are wearing a short skirt or shorts that don't cover your knees, you wont be allowed inside the temple."
,,Fascinating visit,4.0,,"OK so I don't really understand Buddhism, but that's not essential as this is such an interesting place to visit. First impression is that there is only the ground floor to visit. However, there are four floors and a roof top garden that included a huge prayer wheel to visit. The whole place is immaculately cared for with open signs of devotion by those worshipping. The best part for me was I felt a sense of tranquility whilst visiting, unlike the busy streets of Chinatown surrounding the temple. The actual room where you can view the tooth relic was a very sacred place and I very much sensed that. If temples aren't for you, avoid. If you want to immerse yourself in something special in Singapore, give it a try."
,,It's worth one visit,3.0,,"A modern temple (constructions started in 2005) built in traditional Tsang dynasty-style.
The building is nice and we enjoyed exploring the 5 floors, including the roof-top small orchid ""garden"". Two of the floors feature a museum or rather a collection of Buddha relics and related artifacts. Decoration is rich and colorful (maybe a bit too rich and too colorful), descriptions are rare and not very informative.
I think it is worth one visit if you are exploring Chinatown, but probably it is not a place where you will return to."
,,Not What I Expected But good,4.0,,"The Buddha Temple is far grander than I expected. Spectacular in fact. Situated right next to China Town, it's well worth a visit but will only occupy you for less than 15minutes I think...."
,,Shiny and Glitzy for a Temple. Hundreds of Buddha's!,4.0,,"The temple is located at the end of the old Chinese Market, and it beautifully maintained - like most of Singapore. The highlight for me were the hundreds of Buddha's lining the walls.

I also appreciated that the Temple was filled with worshipers and active monks, not just tourists."
,,A quiet place in the middle of Chinatown,4.0,,Wonderful garden at the top floor with praying wheel. Peace in the middle of the Chinatown buzz. Very interesting exhibition on Buddhism as well
,,Peace,5.0,,"everything in this temple represents peace. Very historical and beautiful, regardless of your beliefs."
,,the holy place,4.0,,i think when you are upset of anything the best place that you can go is to this temple and relax your mind.i m sure you will feel much better and forgot all your problems.
,,A brilliant place to visit in Chinatown.,5.0,,"An amazing temple and museum in Chinatown.
I have visited Chinatown in Singapore many times and have always admired this building from the outside, but until now, I have never ventured inside. What a mistake. Even if you are not Buddhist you are welcome to this lovely attraction with its fabulous statues and wonderful history of the rise of Buddhism. Buddhism for Dummies if you like. Just remember to show the respect the temple and its worshippers deserve.
Incredible statues and to top it off, a beautiful roof garden with unbelievable orchids.
Oh yes, spotlessly clean toilets as well."
,,sanctuary in the bustle of the city,5.0,,"Loved the atmosphere in the temple, quite clean and beautiful. We went in the early evening, wasn't crowded - missed the top garden... would of been great. Sorry to see they are building high-rises around the temple. What a contrast!"
,,Beautiful sanctuary in the city centre,5.0,,"Typical Buddhist temple, a must see for any visit to Singapore, and don't miss the beautiful rooftop garden."
,,Passing by this Buddha Tooth Relic Temple on our visit to the China Town,3.0,,"For believers and Buddha Temple lovers, this is a clean and organized place for prayers. Non-believers like us visit the temple with respect but without much involvement."
,,"Gold, gold, gold..for real.",5.0,,"GOLD,GOLD, GOLD--FOR REAL. While there are many tourists there are also genuine worshippers, mostly Chinese. You can pickup free books and brochures about Buddha and Buddhism."
,,Blessed by a Monk,5.0,,"this temple is less crowded and more authentic than others in Singapore. The tooth relic is kinda weird, but interesting. There was a monk there that gave us a private blessing for a small donation. It was surprisingly emotional. Really quite interesting."
,,A very special place,5.0,,As much as this is not an old temple it is awe-inspiring and well worth the visit. The vibrant colours and chanting really set the ambiance. It is in the Chinatown section of Singapore. One of the City Sightseeing HOHO is close by. The Chinatown street market and Sri Mariamman Temple are also accessed from this stop.
,,Loved seeing such spendour,4.0,,"I have to admit that the 'tooth relic' passed us by and we just went in here to have a look around the temple.

I was handed a shawl as I entered in order to cover my head - no problem with that.

What a magnificent and opulent place! Not to everyone's liking maybe but you could not but be in awe of such splendour and beauty in my opinion. Great to have a different experience of a holy place.

Recommend a visit with out doubt."
,,interesting,4.0,,Try to visit this place if you're interested to see a lot of Buddha relics. This place is huge. It is good that we didnt need to pay an entrance fee. They keep the buddha tooth on the top floor. You will be much interested to know how they keep it when the security guy tells you.
,,More than just another temple,4.0,,"With the large functioning temple downstairs, the museum on the mezzanine, the ancestral tablet hall, the tooth relic and the rooftop garden, this was a great way to learn about Buddhism and see how it works. What a great way to make the temple accessible! If you want to see one temple, make it this one!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"We accidentally discovered this temple in Chinatown while escaping the heat of the midday sun, and were so very glad that we did.
Amazing chanting from all the Buddhists present, and somewhat ethereal to hear the single drum beat.
Wonderful sense of reverence and prayer.
I came away quite moved."
,,A Buddha Attraction,3.0,,"Visit this place only if you are interest to learn more about Buddha or Buddhism . The climax is at the top of this temple where there is supposed to be a Buddha Tooth. However, this temple is situation right at Chinatown, a walk around Chinatown is not a bad idea after you finished visiting the temple. Remember, the sun in Singapore is very strong, so it will be ideal if you can visit the temple at around 4pm and after that you can check out Chinatown or maybe even have your dinner there."
,,Colourful and tranquil,4.0,,Whilst this Temple is slightly on the touristy side it still has this marvellous air of tranquility. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area but I would not go there as a specific destination.
,,Tourist must,4.0,,A very touristy area of Singapore with this temple in the midst of the area a walk in this area will be a delight for any tourist even on a two day stop over this is worth a visit.
,,Classic,5.0,,We had lunch at the Maxwell Food Center so it was a quick walk across the street to this elaborately designed temple. We enjoyed touring and looking at the many objects.
,,Impressive temple with wonderful extras,5.0,,"This temple is a large new complex which is probably the most immaculate Chinese temple I have ever seen.

Huge hall inside which had the faithful chanting prayers along with a monk drumming a tune when I visited.

Lots of photo opportunities.

Tooth relic is on an upper floor where photography is not allowed but a special ambiance is created by people meditating silently.

There is a roof garden with a prayer wheel on top.

Also in the complex, there is a great museum with antique Buddhas and an explanation of Buddhism and its stories and beliefs."
,,30 minute look,3.0,,"One of those places one should visit as one comes out slightly better informed but in my case non the wiser. Very ornate and over powering. There are 10,000 miniature Buddha statues in this building. Women to cover shoulders and knees.

All part of travelling, entry is free and I am glad I went. It's in the middle of ChinaTown which is a must visit, very safe and clean and thorougly fascinating."
,,A modern Temple,4.0,,"It located in Chinatown Area. This is the 4th floor building, contain a Tooth Relic display at the top of the building, and Museum about Buddhist History. The Grund Floor is a Temple where you can have a pray. Worth to visit."
,,Beautiful and peaceful temple,5.0,,"Beautiful and peaceful temple located in the Chinatown district of Singapore. If you want to go inside the temple, you must be wearing appropriate clothing (bare shoulders and legs are not allowed), however, there are shawls by the front entrance that tourists can borrow to cover themselves before walking in the temple. There are 4 floors for you to explore; the bottom floor contains different halls for worship, and the top floor has a garden in the middle. There is no entrance fee to go in. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Very special place,4.0,,Loved this! Very well presented. Fantastic waxworks. Really glad that I spent some time here. Make sure you go all the way up to the roof garden.
,,Ornate and interesting.,5.0,,Beautiful displays. Free to visit. Safe area in China Town. Easy walk from China Town MRT station right next to the info boooth.
,,Religious & Cultural Immersion,5.0,,"This is one place I love about SG. I swear, if I'm not a Christian, I would be a Buddhist. Anyway, one should wear proper attire when going here. I was wearing shorts when I visited so they lent me a ""sarong"" or huge cloth to create a makeshift skirt. It's amazing inside. So peaceful & calming. You would be able to see thousands of buddha relics & different artifacts from old times. Don't forget to go up to the meditation garden and make a wish at the wheel of fate!:)"
,,Shopping,5.0,,There are a lot of little shops and food stalls near here. Good place to get a few things to take back home for family and friends.
,,Buddha tooth relic temple and museum,5.0,,"If you take the lift to highest level , there is historic things for you to see around. I remember there is sort of sitting place around there , it make you feel peace of mind and very relax."
,,Small but different tempel in China town,3.0,,This temple is beautiful but very smaller than longoha temple of Shanghai and if visited there I don't advise this
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,"If you are going to China Town, you must go to this Buddhist temple. Singaporean will prefer to go and pray to the big temple in Bugis. The Buddha Tooth Relic is peaceful place. The entrance is free. You would be surprised by the number of small Buddha statues offered by people in this temple. You can visit the second floor."
,,Just happened upon it,4.0,,"While shopping in Chinatown, we stopped to take pictures of the temple and noticed it was open. We were allowed in to take photos and even provided with wrap to cover shoulders. We watched the monks chanting and praying in their orange robes against the bright gold statues with the incense in the air. It felt very spiritual."
,,Arguably most famous temple in Singapore,5.0,,"The entire 1st floor are well decorated and houses thousands of Buddha Statues on the walls. Entrance is free and no pressure of being asked to pay for anything. Everything here is voluntary. Photo taking is allowed within the first floor, photographers will be in for a treat."
,,Add to your visit to Chinatown!,5.0,,Visited this wonderful temple on Chinese New Year so it was particularly festive. The inside was packed with locals making offerings and receiving blessings from monks. It was actually rather chaotic and we look forward to going on another trip when we might be able to experience a more serene version of the temple.
,,YOU MUST SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE,5.0,,"what a lovely place! so peaceful even though there were alot of people there! free entry though there are donation boxes which you should put into and youll see why when you visit!! dont worry about clothing they provide long skirts and shawls if your clothes like mine dont meet there requirments!
there are 4 levels for you to explore, each as gorgeous as the last (including one floor telling the story beautifully of buddha)!
A must see in singapore!!"
,,Fascinating and peaceful,5.0,,"An amazing traditionally built building with many levels and much to see. More like a museum but interestingly, it was also used as a meditation place and working temple where priests were doing blessings (for a donation). Lots to see and we actually ran out of time. Got there around 2.30pm and it closed around 6pm so didn't see everything. The tooth relic was most precious and housed in a room surrounded by decorations. Could sense that it was a holy place and it was very peaceful and restful walking around the place. Loved the ground floor with the thousands of hand-carved buddhas lining the walls and loved the Dharma Wheel section on the top floor which was surrounded by lush garden. Delightful surprise.
Well worth the visit. Some quiet time away from the hustle and bustle of Chinatown."
,,"One of a kind temple, must see",5.0,,"located in Chinatown, this temple is one of the most beautiful Chinese temples that I have seen, so colorful so bring your camera for some great pictures. You can see it in about 30 min free admission"
,,BTRTR,5.0,,"This temple is huge! This multi storey temple is located on south bridge road, and this temple is Mahayana-Chinese style. The main hall is a huge ( I mean it) Maitreya Buddha statue, With mastharnaprapta Boddhisattva and Avalokitesvara boddhisattva. Both chinese style.Above are Buddhist museums. I reccomend this temple. Prayers are 25 minutes long, starts from nine am and starts over every 2 hours. I reccomend this temple."
,,Lost for Words,5.0,,"Yes indeed folks, this is another not to be missed attraction for the curious tourist. It is also a truly amazing demonstration of love for and devotion to Buddha. The skills of the craftsmen and artists that designed, built and decorated this place are second to none and the reds and golds are almost blinding in intensity and never to be forgotten.

We were also surprised and delighted to find there was so much more to see than we first imagined there would be"
,,Don't miss level 4-before 6pm,4.0,,"Nearest MRT : Chinatown (Exit A) - about 5-7 mins.
The temple closes at 7pm, but level 2,3 and 4 close at 6pm

Located nearest Marriamman temple - Sungapore's oldest indian temple built in 1822, is this relatively new and impressive Buddhist temple.

There are two life size statues of muscular temple guards at the gate.

Visitors are allowed to wear footwear in this temple like most other Buddhist temples in Singapore.

The ground floor consists of giant golden statues of Buddhist Gods. There are smaller and medium size Buddha statues adorning the wall. Visitors cross and reach the back room. There are statues of other Buddhist gods and goddesses like Avalokiteshwara and guardian deities for each of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs.

Visit level 4 by lift, for glimpse of what is believed to be the tooth of Siddharth Gautama, the founder of Buddhism. Visitors need to take off their footwear before entering this temple.

There was a gentleman mediating at the platform in the temple when we visited.

You need to climb up one more level to reach the roof gardens. There are automatic chairs if you have difficulty climbing up. The garden is small and peaceful. There is a giant chakra or wheel which is used for prayers by rotating.

Chinatown visitor centre is located behind the temple."
,,MAJESTIC,4.0,,Heart of Chinatown. Great evening time visit and lovely prayer songs which I nevrr understood.. good architecture.
,,What a temple!!!,5.0,,This place must NOT be missed! I've been to many places of worship and this is by far on the top of my list! It was very impressive! Make sure you bring your camera because it is majestic. I did not realize there was more than one floor or I would have definitely gone up! I'm actually quite disappointed that I did not read about this place prior to visiting. We thought we would just walk right through and maybe take about 5 minutes but we were so mesmerized by it's beauty that we ending up staying for almost an hour.
,,Culture!,5.0,,"Beautiful temple and a great opportunity to absorb the oriental culture! In the middle of Chinatown, this is a must see in Singapore!"
,,very intersting and beautiful,5.0,,"very interesting, colorful, meditating, inspiring place. Went to the top floor and turned around the prayer wheel for half an hour, so inspired was I !"
,,A Chance Visit to Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,5.0,,"We were taken to China Town by the tour conductor, and given a brief introduction of the places to see. We wades through the market, and saw the Hindu Temple, the Mosque on the main road and just went past as there was nothing appreciably different about these from what we have seen elsewhere. Most of the fellow travelers walked back to the bus, but we happened to notice the Buddha Temple, and were almost mesmerized by its grandeur! Have seen many Budhist temples in India, especially in Ladakh, but this one was very impressive ! We ventured in too, and our appreciation kept going up !"
,,never miss this place,5.0,,A beautiful architectural place that someone who enjoys art should visit. The intricate designs are majestic!
,,Its worth a visit,4.0,,If you're in Chinatown then the Tooth Relic Temple is right there and well worth a visit. It's quite big and over 4 or 5 floors with loads of exhibits inside so you could spend a while here if you wanted. There was a ceremony going on downstairs when we went which was interesting. We explored the other floors but didn't pay to see the actual tooth relic. Some rather good ( though strange) waxworks of past monks and lots of buddhist artefacts plus plenty of explanations.
,,Don't miss seeing this temple it's worth it,4.0,,"Really enjoyed our brief visit to this temple. It's ornate, real and vibrant and gives you an in insight into the values and customs of all those who worship here. It is in Chinatown, so easy to get to when strolling around soaking up the atmosphere; would recommend combining a visit here with a wider mooch round Chinatown as it's good fun to see."
,,gorgeous temple,5.0,,Lovely temple. The walls with hundreds of Buddhas are impressive. House monks available to answer questions and provide blessings.
,,Best temple to see in singapore,5.0,,"If you only see one temple, make it this one. They hold services inside which you can view, you must be covered up or you can borrow their wraps to cover yourself. Make sure to visit the 4th floor where they mediate and the rooms are full of gold statues."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,Very beautiful Chinese temps that is hard to be seen. It's around temp streets so Muslim and Indian temp can be visited together at one time.
,,A sacred pause,3.0,,"It's not India or Tibet, but a visit to this sacred temple, crowded with worshippers and tourists alike, is a must when in Singapore. Situated in bustling Chinatown it's a great stop while combining a walking tour of the area. Lots to buy, eat and see."
,,Fun and educational temple experience,5.0,,"This temple had some very interesting museum like displays on the history of Buddhism as well as a very nice garden on the roof. The Buddha tooth room was also very nice, especially as they had areas set aside for meditation. Sarongs were available in the front entrance for free."
,,Serenely beautiful,4.0,,"Nestled in the hustle and bustle of China town stands the Buddha tooth relic and museum. the simple Chinese style structure gives no clue to the beauty within. A stunningly beautiful temple it is an oasis of calm. Every inch of the temple walls are adorned with carved, gilded or embroidered details of Buddha. The top floors have a museum as well as the tooth relic after which the temple is named. Devotees chant or meditate quietly. The museum has a wonderful and well catalogued collections of artefacts related to Buddha. A must visit!"
,,Gorgeous Temple,5.0,,"We visited many temples while on our recent trip to 6 Asian countries. But this is for sure one of the most beautiful ones. Worth the visit (even if you are not a Buddhist, which we are not)."
,,good if you are in the area,3.0,,"it is a nice temple if you have time and are in the china town area, we saw it during Chinese new year so lots of decoration, Not sure how it looks other times but the may Buddha statues (or something else I don't really know what they are called, sorry) are interesting though."
,,You shouldn't miss this temple.,5.0,,"Very unique and ornate temple ! Carvings, statues, paintings adorn it. Peaceful and elegant in its own way. I haven't seen one quite like it during my travels to Japan."
,,One of several temples in close proximity in Chinatown,5.0,,"Most temples fairly relaxed about dress but much stricter here on shorts , men and women ,and shoulder covering ."
,,"If you like Budda, you'll like this",3.0,,"Dressed up for the Chinese New Year, this place was crowded with tourists walking thru. A circular visit track was in place, allowing one to travel from front door around the outside wall of the temple, returning to the start. No charge, but not much either."
,,The Museum and the garden on the terrace are the best part!,5.0,,The Buddhist museum is really worth a visit. The best part of the museum is the gallery where no photography is allowed. The garden around the room housing the prayer wheel on the terrace is very beautiful.
,,Frenetic but fun and illuminating,4.0,,We happened to visit the temple just prior to Chinese New Year and it was alive and bustling with both worshippers and visitors. There is a great deal to take in and hence it is worth setting aside a couple of hours for a full tour.
,,Well worth a stop,5.0,,"This is an interesting temple. It covers several floors and you must visit the roof garden, it is great to enter the tranquil peace offered there after fighting your way through the China Town crowds."
,,Tooth relic and 1000s of Buddahs,5.0,,"If you are travelling in south-east Asia you may feel you have seen enough temples, but this one is worth the visit. It is very open for tourists/visitors. There are four floors to visit with various relics and museum displays. The roof top garden is rather lovely and the massive prayer wheel can be turned. The tooth relic is on a separate floor with lots of gold accessories. On the day we visited there was a guide who was happy to explain the significance of the the accessories and point out where to look for the tooth behind the glass case. We saw it!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,"This is just as impressive as any cathedral I have visited. Visiting on Chinese New Year day it was busy but not terrilbly crowded. Just glowing red and gold throughout with 1,000s of Buddhas lining the walls. On the 4th floor roof there is a prayer ""wheel"" and orchid garden and few people. Just like everywhere unsupervised kids got hold of the prayer wheel and were running around like a playground. Not entirely meditative with until they left."
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"This temple complex comprises a number of rooms and worship halls, which visitors may view. It also has a very good exhibition centre. Visitors are welcome but are expected to show respect, by dressing modestly. Photography is permitted in most parts of the temple. Overall, it is definitely worth a visit."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Enjoyable visit and could take photographs. So many statues and accessible. Did not see the tooth and only visited the ground floor due to time constraints. Located near the Chinese market and Hindu Temple, both worth a visit."
,,A Must See in China Town.,4.0,,A beautiful ornate temple on the edge of CHina Town. It is free to visit. Photos are permitted. Offerings are encouraged but not forced. It is dazzling and worth at least 30 minutes of your time. It is also educational about one of the major religions of the world. There are 100 dragons in this temple and thousands of Buddha's.
,,Chanting,5.0,,"We visited many temples while we where in Asia, but this was the only one where the monks were chanting during our visit.This made our day because of the inspiring and highly spiritual atmosphere created by their sound. This temple is very beautiful and decorated with so many details that it is almost impossible to absorb it all with only one brief visit. I wish that some day I will be able to go back."
,,Amazing Temple! Must visit!,5.0,,"You really should visit this temple if you're in Singapore! It is a tourist attraction however it's worth every min. I've been here several times and I loved it each time I visited. The staff are friendly and help you with any questions. You can take pictures inside. Usually, there is a religious prayer session or gathering in the middle area which makes it even more interesting when visiting. The budda's are massive and you can get great pics! There is also and upstairs section with various religious statues so make sure not to miss this out!

The temple is located right next to Chinatown market so plenty of things to do afterwards. Also, make sure to visit the indian temple a couple of streets away, it's outstanding!!!"
,,Never saw the tooth but the monks were chanting and playing,4.0,,A beautiful building obviously restored with lots of gilt and incense. Worth the walk in during their open hours.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"Get away from the city rush!Wonderful, calming experience. Take your time to explore this hidden gem of Singapore.A perfect place to get away from the the bustling city to recharge yourself."
,,One of the Nicest Temples in SE Asia,5.0,,"You'll get a feeling of spirituality as you walk through this temple, watch the monks pray and the followers offer sacrifices in the incense sand outside."
,,Best decorative temple,5.0,,"Yes it was one of the best decorative temple we ever had a chance to see (we tended to visit a Buddha temple wherever we visited). From its solid, proud standing posture to its golden runs of Buddhas and ornaments, they provided us with a stunning show. There were huge of amounts of those but did not make it too clustered due to, may be, its large space building.

On entering the inner main doors, you would be required to cover yourself up a bit with newly washed robe (sarong) and shoulder shawl that were lent to you free of charge if you happen to be wearing clothes that were too light! Well fair enough for a place of worshiping.

We came too close to the closing time at 5 or 6 pm and could only make the ground floor missing all other upper ones. But even that was already very impressive for us. Next time if we had another chance we would do the whole thing.

It was in heart of Chinatown and opposite is the famous Maxwell foodcourt so you can make a trip to see heap of things including this temple and feed yourselves too."
,,Good place,4.0,,"I went to this place to see nice decoration and donated. It is one of the good place to go. It has many floors. If you go up, you will see golden Buddha image."
,,"Red, Gold and Opulent",5.0,,We enjoyed seeing this temple when we were visiting Chinatown. The first floor has hundreds of little niche shrines that hold small Buddah and the main attraction is a gold Buddha altar in the middle of the main room. There is lots of gold and lots of red and the result is quite spectacular. We enjoyed seeing the other floors of the temple especially the room where the Buddah Tooth was displayed. There were many people meditating and it was quite serene. Don't miss the garden on the top floor or the beautiful prayer wheel. You must remove your shoes in certain areas. We were glad we took the time to visit.
,,Beautiful Buddha RelicTemple Near China Town.,4.0,,"I went there during Chinese new year. It is a beautiful Buddha Tooth relic Temple. As it was chinese new year, it was bit croded. Beautifuly built and Colourfully decorated very nice classic structure on the main road."
,,Very peaceful,5.0,,"This is a beautiful temple in China town. This has three levels and it closes by about 7pm. The area upstairs where the actual tooth is located closes about 6pm. You are meant to be fully clothed - longer bermudas (3/4ths) are ok but short shorts or sleeveless tops are not allowed. You can take your own shawl or u can borrow the temple sarongs n scarves that must be returned. There is a huge bell on the top most floor which is also a must see. If you want to plan a trip to this area then you could spend about 3 to 4 hours in China town around this temple, about an hour in this Buddha temple and there is another Indian temple close by where you could spend about 30 mins. In both the temples you have to be conservatively dressed and have to take off your footwear in the Indian temple (socks is allowed I think). You will find a lot of shops/ stalls around this area which sell clothing to trinkets to mementos. You could also enjoy the tender coconuts (for about $2) or have dinner n drinks in the many restaurants close by. The signs to the MRT is also very well located to take you to your next destination. Taxis are also easily available. With the Chinese New Year celebs going on, the lighting in this area is truly awesome. Don't miss this."
,,Serene experience,4.0,,"This was our third visit to the serene temple and we came back feeling rejuvenated. the many Buddha idols and decor all around and the general sense of peace was quite welcome. this is a clean, spic and span temple in Chinatown and worth a visit when there."
,,Must visit this marvellous temple,5.0,,"Buddha tooth relic temple is not an usual part of Singapore tourist itinerary but that should change. It is highly recommended that you visit this place for the sheer beauty and elegance of this temple. Give around 1 hour to visit this place.
Located in China town this temple should be a must visit place for anyone in Singapore."
,,Wonderful Temple,4.0,,"We missed seeing the actual tooth room (it closed right before we got there) but the temple itself was very beautiful and not incredibly crowded, even though it was the Chinese New Year season. :D The temple is open late, but the room with the tooth closes at 6 pm, so get there before then if you want to see it."
,,A Temple worth visiting,4.0,,"A good time to visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is in the early morning when it is slightly cooler and less people visiting. Allow about 45 minutes and you should see the Monks at prayer in their Orange Robes. Ladies and Men should take off their Shoes and Socks, and have their shoulders covered and take a shawl if you are wearing shorts. Otherwise a great place to visit and especially in February leading up to Chinese New Year with the Lanterns in the Streets leading up to the Temple"
,,Garden at the roof,5.0,,"Beautiful garden on the rooftop! It is a very quiet and serene atmosphere. Try to find out when the monks are chanting, this is very special."
,,So exotic,4.0,,Ventured in to see what was happening! Able to move around inside temple. No internal photographs allowed.
,,quick flash back to world of peace,4.0,,its a temple and museum which wont take 30-45 min to visit. if you visit before new year or lantern festival you would see lantern hung on pathway. Inside it has all the material and beautiful relic to impress. great to take pictures
,,all gold and glitter,5.0,,"A very big and glamorous temple, in the middle of Chinatown. We were there twice and both times they had service with several Buddhist monks and chanting (aprox. 3-4 p.m.) Almost every statue and depiction has an info box with interesting insight into Buddhist religion."
,,Temple of calm,5.0,,This was a great place to see. I would say it's a must. It's beautiful and has a lovely calmness about it. It's free entry and so worth seeing.
,,The materialistic face of Buddha,3.0,,"This monumental Tang Dynasty style Buddhist temple was built in 2005 to house a sacred relic of the founder of the Buddhist faith. A gaudy, gilded pagoda-like exterior conceals vast, heavily overdecorated ceremonial halls and spaces for devotional tourism. The lavish interior is full of symbolic statues of Buddha, though the religion has at its core the renunciation of worldly wealth. Not for the fainthearted or religious sceptic. Clean toilets and proximity to Chinatown's food street are a plus."
,,a great place to visit in chinatown,5.0,,a very beautiful and colored place to visit with welcome from staff of temple . i like the place and recommended to be visited
,,STELLAR!!,5.0,,"my favorite things to do while traveling are mingling with the locals, eating the local cuisine, and checking out the most interesting architecture in a new city. which usually happens to be places of worship. and this temple certainly did not disappoint.

in a word - opulent. which fits with the vibe of singapore, as it is a high-end, very well-to-do city. the first floor is really striking, and then there are some nice museum type floors with some impressive relics. but the 4th floor... WOW! one of the most impressive rooms i have ever seen, anywhere. they really spared no cost. this is right up there with the golden temple in amritsar (which i found more impressive than the taj mahal).

you can't actually walk into the room with the golden stupa, but you can view it through glass. which unfortunately has a pretty bad glare... i wonder if there is better, less reflective glass they could use. but the room you are standing in while peering through the glass is also stunning.

and the rooftop garden is really nice as well. to top it all off, the entire place smells like a cinnabon store (buy some incense from the front desk on your way out).

there are some really nice Hindu temples in singapore, as well as some other world class architecture (the marina sands mall is the most impressive mall i have ever seen), but this place stole the show for me.

it's also kitty corner from tian tian chicken and rice."
,,Authentic Buddhist temple with history,4.0,,"First and foremost this is a Buddhist Temple with all the parts, so if you are into religion or the mystic there is plenty to see, touch and wonder about. Secondly there is a great collection of Buddhist imagery and statues laid out in a well explained time line which gives a geat historical overview. Thirdly is the Buddha Tooth relic which, believe it or not, it something really special and is portrayed as such in a spectacular display. There is also a lovely, relaxing, lush garden on the top level; bit small obviously but still a great place to relax for a while and reflect all the wonders this building contains. It is well worth the effort to see this Temple. It is right next to the Chinatown information booth and of course just next to the markets and food halls of Chinatown. 5 minute walk from the metro, you will not regret the visit."
,,"Three in one - a temple, a museum and a garden",4.0,,This was my first visit to a Buddhist temple. I really enjoyed it. The temple is big - four floors. The ground floor is for worship. Nice decorations and statues. Second is museum. Artifacts from several countries are kept here. Third floor is also museum and top floor is a garden. A must see place when in Singapore.
,,beautifully renovated Buddhist temple,5.0,,"The place is a huge temple housing relics of the Buddha. There are 5 floors accessible via elevator with a rooftop garden. There is also a small museum of Buddha statues and a level dedicated to well known monks. The main attraction is the temple and all the gold buddhas big and small. It's free so if you're in the area, a nice place to spend 15 min or 1hr."
,,Try asking the monks questions,1.0,,"Asked a monk about attitudes towards Tibetan monks and nuns ' self-immolation and the controversy about the authenticity of the tooth relic, and he signaled to security for help. Was obviously more comfortable accepting money non stop from devotees before me, but not being questioned. Would highly recommend tourists to pose questions to the monks. Considering the temple was built with dozens of millions of dollars and kilograms of gold, temple seems more like a moneymaking/tourist-drawing attraction for the country's tourism board, than a real temple. Better off visiting more authentic temples in surrounding countries.

Review by a local."
,,Splendor and Incense,4.0,,"What a beautiful temple. We felt very welcome here. If your female companions come in shorts, they will be given a sarang to wear while touring. No need to leave shoes outside. The Temple is magnificent. The tenders, keepers, and monks are cordial. Of all the temples in this area, this is the only one we felt welcome in. The innocence at the entry can be a bit overwhelming if you have any respiratory issues. I suggest moving quickly thru that area and on to the interior. Your photo opps are numerous inside!!!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,This is well worth a trip around if you are in Chinatown ..... beautiful and big buddhist temple........
,,An average temple,3.0,,"It's not a large temple when compared to those in Thailand or in China, but it's situated right beside the Maxwell Food Centre. So just have a visit if you need a walk after eating too much in the hawker centre."
,,Interesting Temple-Must see,5.0,,The ceremony at the temple is interesting. I like the garden on the top and Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel.
,,Peace @ crowded Chinatown,4.0,,Whilst you are walking the crowded streets of Chinatown and haggling for souvenirs and cute kitsch you suddenly enter an oasis of peace...the Buddha Tooth Relic temple....small and serene. We prayed and lit incense sticks and felt calm envelop us.
,,wealth on display,5.0,,"i've seen a lot of buddhist temples, and this one is spectacular in the amount of gold (real gold) everywhere in its huge ornate spaces. don't miss the shrine of the tooth upstairs, where there are even comfortable cushions for those who might wish to meditate. hard to imagine that the buddha himself would enjoy this extravagent place, but it is not to be missed when in singapore."
,,Heart warming,4.0,,"Right in the midst of China Town , the Buddha Tooth Relic temple is situated. Everyone is allowed inside except those with bare uncovered legs. You can light a joss stick , given free by the temple and say your prayer."
,,Buddha tooth relic,3.0,,"This temple quite far from mrt. But when walking, the chinatown surrounding is interesting. Please use proper clothes. As I remember, short pants not allowed. Yes. This temple can't compare with Thailand temple. Try to have lunch or tea break in chinatown. Plenty nice places"
,,Well managed and spiritual,4.0,,"Amazing place with serenity at the heart of the city. With street shopping and food street around, this is a perfect place to calm your mind, stomach and shopping urge at the same time."
,,Big and beautiful,4.0,,"We've seen a lot of temples in our time but this is impressive. They were decorating for Chinese new year which was interesting. Although reviewers have commented about covering up, this is a shoes ON hats OFF temple."
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,5.0,,"A building at the entrance that has a big impact, given its size and architectural beauty.
Women have to cover at the entrance of temple. If no chance of cover, the temple is prepared to provide clothing.
It is a temple with three floors which includes the whole story of Buddha. There is also a lift so we can visit the upper floors.
The temple itself has several historical pieces of Buddhist art that is worth to visit.
I highly recommend."
,,nothing special,2.0,,"if you have been to Thailand temples, than you will not find anything interesting for yourself. in addition to that the surrounding scenary with social apartments do ot give the temple the right mood"
,,Fascinating but a little too touristy,5.0,,Worth a look at this . helps understand this form of Buddhism. Lots of tourists but an actively used temple.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We visited as part of a free walking tour with Indie Singapore. A service was being held while we were there. At the bavk you can find the buddha that is your chinese year of birth! We only visited the 1st floor. Will return if we have time.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,Very few tourist even during peak season. Visited once ealier too in June 2011. A Very nice museum on the top floor.
,,wow,5.0,,"This place was not knwn to me when i visit there but once i entered inside it was a great place amazing view, have seen so many buddha place but not like this place ..love this place"
,,Impressive,4.0,,"So many Buddhas . Very different to Myanmar Buddhas. I found it to be quite different, stunning and at the same time you knew you were present in the historical context . Worth taking your time here. 3rd floor is worth a good look

Tip - as for all temples shoes easy to take on and off, knee length and shoulder covered clothing, good camera and local guide if available"
,,interesting,3.0,,"We stumbled across the Temple accidentally and were not prepared for it, so we only had time to go inside the temple section. It was interesting to see another religion celebrating a ""mass"". Very colourful and lots to photograph."
,,So many Buddhas ...,5.0,,"So many beautiful sculptures, particularly in the museum on the third floor. If one has time, one can learn a lot about Buddha and Buddhism. Loved the roof garden with the largest praying wheel in the world. Amazing experience."
,,Same as most everybody Impressed!,5.0,,"Not a museum or temple fan but on an afternoon when the heavens opened, it provided a surreal and serene refuge for us. Most people were scurrying for other shelter so we wandered at leisure. Very aesthetically pleasing."
,,temple worth its weight in gold,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum Built in 2007 is a recent addition to the historic Chinatown district. The temple and is based on the elements of the Tang Dynasty and the Buddhist Mandala, which is a representation of the Buddhist universe.
The temple is definitely worth a visit, with its rich features of sacred artifacts of the Buddha and exhibits on Buddhist art and culture. the Buddhist Culture Museum is located on the third floor. the Sacred Light Hall on the fourth floor that contains the temple’s centerpiece
The Buddha Tooth Relic is stored in a giant stupa weighing 3.5 tonnes and made from 320kg of gold, of which 234kg were donated by devotees. this relic Can only be viewed from the public area, I believe only monks are allowed into the relic chamber.
Other highlights include the Eminent Sangha Museum, a theatre that holds cultural performances, talks and film screenings.
If you need some quiet meditation amid Chinatown’s hubbub, the roof garden, with its pagoda and Buddha prayer wheel, is a good spot."
,,Gem,5.0,,The temple is a gem to visit and worth an hour out of your day in China Town. Often there will be ceremonies in the main hall but tourists are always welcomed.
,,"""Fabulous""",4.0,,"We were lucky enough to visit when a prayer service was in progress and we found it to be enlightening to listen to the prayers and chants. The sheer beauty of the temple is just amazing with all the intricate art and decoration. A great place for those local photo opportunities, but also a very relaxing and peaceful place to visit. It is right in the middle of Chinatown on the main road and very easy to locate. I have no hesitation in suggesting a visit if you are in the area and if you want a feel of local religious customs."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The temple is beautiful. I was there when the monks were chanting, which added to the beauty. Shoulders and knees need to be covered, but I think they had some items you could borrow to cover up. There was no fee to enter, but they did have a donation box. Photography was allowed. Now that I read some of the other reviews on the temple, I realize I missed so much because I just stayed on the first floor. Apparently there are four floors and a roof garden, so if you read this in advance, you will know to check those out on your visit."
,,Very Cool Cultural Attraction,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a great free attraction in Chinatown. I've been through it several times--it is worth at least an hour. It has several levels and a rooftop terrace. Photography is allowed on all except the top floor where the Buddha tooth is kept. One floor has a cultural history on Buddha and Buddhism which provides a great overview of Buddhism for those interested.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The entire temple is filled with so many relics, statues and information on the culture and religion. I found it fascinating and it was so beautiful in there. From the second floor upwards are many statues and figures to look at. It was so calm and peaceful in there, and it was interesting to observe the people praying."
,,Service in progress.,4.0,,We came upon this temple by chance while wandering through Chinatown at night. A service was in progress but the attendants ushered us Into the back to watch and listen to the chants. Having visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy (Sri Lanka) many years ago it brought back memories. We would have gone back for a proper visit if time allowed.
,,Remarkambe temple,5.0,,"Even though you're of a different religion, this temple is one to see when you're in Chinatown. It has its own museum with loads of information and its exhibits are clearly marked. You might find yourself a witness to a religious ceremony as well."
,,Temple bliss,4.0,,"As a lover of temples, this one was worth the visit as it was air conditioned and very ornate allowing photography as well."
,,Awe Inspiring Beauty,5.0,,"In our travels through Asia we have seem many Temples, some beautiful some gaudy and some you could have not visited. This is by far one of the most beautiful and serene temples we have seen. The basic layout is traditional and simple with side alters but the decoration and statuary are breathtaking. All the pieces are hand carved and decorated with intricate detail.

There is no charge to enter the temple but there are places to leave donations that help with the upkeep etc. Visitors please note that you need to wear appropriate long sleeves and legs must be covered although wraps are available so please ensure that you respect this serene place by covering up."
,,Really worth a special trip,5.0,,Did not know what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised. Wear long clothes although if you're not you can borrow something when you get there. You could spend up to 1 hour there since there are 4 floors and the roof top garden is worth going to. Beautiful relics and an area just to be at peace for a while if you have the time on the 3rd floor. been to singapore many times don't know why I didn't discover this place before.
,,Serene place,3.0,,Easy to visit. Not crowded when I went there. There are interesting streets and markets around the temple.
,,A very peaceful temple,5.0,,I really enjoyed visiting this temple and seeing all of the relics as well as learning about the meanings behind them. A very peaceful place. Definitely worth a visit
,,Interesting Temple,4.0,,"Lovely interior, interesting location. Visit the square behind and people watch or check out the Chinatown mall. Close to others temples and the Chinatown street market."
,,worth a look,4.0,,fully functional vintage temple in operation by locals and worth a visit in Chinatown; musical prayers usually ongoing; colorful.
,,a very large pagoda,3.0,,the relic is in a very photogenic pagoda in the middle of chinatown. its probably more of a visit to take photos of the building than to see the relic. worth a look
,,Beautiful and informative,5.0,,I go the the temple every time I am in Singapore. The temple is just so beautiful. The museum on the upper floor is very informative about Buddhism. They offer free tours on Saturdays afternoon; registration on the website is required.
,,stunning but cover up,5.0,,"Visited here as part of a family group during prayers & it was stunning inside. However they are really strict with the covering up of flesh on show (& quite rightly so I hear you say) to the point that our daughter was denied access even tho she had her shoulders covered with a shall brought especially, her legs were visible below the knee.
Good toilets if your desperate."
,,Elevating Experience,5.0,,"The temple complex is very elaborate with hundreds of statues - big and small. All the statues are beautiful. There is a huge rush of devotees but all are walking around in a very organised and quiet manner.
The main statue of Lord Buddha is very impressive with a very serene expression.
A truly worthwhile experience"
,,Wow BUSY but very beautiful,4.0,,"Enjoyed our visit here, couldn't believe how busy it was though. Still able to enjoy the temple. We almost left having looked around the ground floor and on the way out we realised there were other levels that were accessible to visitors, worthwhile finding the lift and exploring the Temple.
The markets outside are great for souvenirs."
,,Can't see the tooth,2.0,,"I entered this attraction to try confirm if it really was a tooth. But it was placed in the middle of a room, too far away for anyone to see the real thing. At the same time, the place is very elaborate, with the top floor of 10,000 buddhas and the main room as well. A gallery had the life history of gautama buddha and spoke of the future (prophecy according to buddhist thought) - that was the most interesting part."
,,Peaceful and beautiful Experience,5.0,,"While working in Singapore, my family came to stay with me over the feastive season. On new years day i took them to the tooth relic temple, one of the most beatiful temples i have come across in my travels. It was a great way to celebrate the new year. Doesn't matter what religion you are its a must see when your in singapore. So much to see and learn about a beautiful religion, visit every level and the roof top. The colour and grandeur will impress."
,,Must visit Temple,5.0,,"This five story temple is located in Chinatown. It has a traditional temple gate with 3 large, heavy, red lacquered doors. The main hall on the ground floor of this temple is very big and has a breath taking view of Maitreya Trinity, with the Bodhisattva Dharma Garden Grove on the left and the Bodhisattva Great Wondrous Appearance on the right. Maitreya is a bodhisattva who will appear on Earth in the future, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma.
One gets to hear a very soothing chant and smells aroma of lighted agarbatis. The side walls are decorated with the 100 statutes of Buddha in different gestures. At the back side there was a stutute of Buddha having 6 arms.
With limited time at our disposal we could see only the ground floor of the Temple. What soever we saw may great.

,,Surprise,4.0,,Didn't expect this & actually quite a lot of things to see spanning over 5/6 floors in the middle of Chinatown. Worth a visit when you are in Chinatown.
,,Make it to the Rooftop,5.0,,This newish Temple is beautifully done with an excellent museum and the roof top terrace and prayer wheel bell the largest cloisonné bell I have ever seen. Allow an hour to an hour and a half to relax and enjoy.
,,Lovely,5.0,,"What a great Temple, the history and information was amazing. Felt very welcome to look around and learn about the history."
,,Impressive,4.0,,The location of the place is what surprised me at first. The temple is placed right in the middle of a busy street in china town and in spite of that the temple is peaceful serene and worth every time in your itinerary. The exhibits go upto five floors of the temple. It’s that vast. The place is a very good option if you are interested in learning and knowing history especially that of Buddhism. The artworks at the whole place is impressive. Be sure to be dressed properly while visiting the temple.
,,Outstanding!! and Peaceful,5.0,,"This was probably our greatest joy and surprise during our short visit to Singapore.
We were taken here by my brother-in-law who lives in Singapore. It is part of the China Town area. You need several hours to get the most out of this visit, and it is on 5 floors - but there is a lift.
The displays inform you about Buddhism, shows off the amazing craft skills associated with this religion and eventually enables one to experience the serenity of those who practise Buddhism and those who pray. Parallels to themes within Christianity and other religions are illuminating."
,,Searching for peacefulness,5.0,,"This is a great place to meditate, learn the history of Buddha and to find peace and quite in the midst of busy Chinatown area."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"you can get close to see how a Buddhist temple is and experience the culture, very beautiful temple, you can just walk from Chinatown MRT"
,,Amazing Temple,4.0,,"Really Amazing Temple, but unluckily, I'm not prepare my fashion. I wear open shoulder tshirt and short pant. So I could not enter the temple. Please prepare the fashion."
,,Outstanding relics,5.0,,"As someone who doesn't practise Buddhism, the temple was a visit for me of just aesthetic value. The detail with which the temple has been decorated and looked after is stunning, improved only by the information boards which helped me to understand the symbolism and power of the different relics."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Quite one of the biggest and most spectacular temples we have seen outside China but considerable more lavish with the gold and the gold leaf than we have seen in most places, reflecting the wealth of Singapore."
,,All Gold Everything,4.0,,Beautiful. No fee and you can get lost and wonder for hours. A lot of history and beautiful culture.
,,The highlight of any Chinatown visit,5.0,,"Situated in the heart of Chinatown, this beautiful temple is partly functional and partly museum. Spread over four floors are exhibits and thousands of Buddha statues, all topped by a tranquil roof garden. During our visit a ceremony was taking place on the ground with a number of chanting monks, which added atmosphere and authentication to the visit. Most impressive of all is the actual Buddha Tooth Relic area with its lavish gold decoration. My advice would be to start your visit at the top of the building by taking one of the lifts, and then working your way down the various floors."
,,Grandeur.,5.0,,"I haven't been to many Buddhist temples and the purpose of this note is not to compare temples. That said, the tooth relic temple in Chinatown is splendid with its myriad statues of the Buddha and other legends from the Buddhist mythology. Do not miss the chance to meditate to chants, visit the rooftop garden with orchids and a prayer wheel and walk around in the museum to trace the origins and spread of Buddhism around the world."
,,Tranquil & calming.,5.0,,"I decided to visit the temple on the first anniversary of my dads death. I was away from home & family and it seemed a fitting place to take a few minutes to remember.
I drove & had planned on parking at the temple but the car park is currently out of action. The on street parking was full but there's a multi story you can use about a block away under offices as alternative parking during the works.
Before entering the temple I covered my shoulders and knees with the complimentary shawls they offered. I made a donation (you go not need to make a donation, it's personal choice) in the big boxes at the front of the temple & lit incense.
There is also a place on the outside where you could donate food for the monks.
Inside the temple was beautiful, very ornate. We were able to walk around the edges, listening to the monks service & chanting. You can identify your deities from your birth year, it tells you about the characteristics of each & tells you your corresponding animal. You're able to donate change/cash in front of the deities should you choose to.
I chose to buy a candle with jasmine buds around it for S$10 to light (you could buy an orchid for S$2 or just a candle for S$5). The sales lady actually changed the flowers as those already left were going brown - a nice gesture. I lit my candle & placed it on the big table, reflecting on a past life. Although there were others visiting it wasn't crowded & I was in no way rushed or moved on etc. I was able to take the time I wanted/needed before joining my mil & friend again.
It was the right choice for me to visit on that day. I did take my baby with me but she didn't come inside; FIL agreed to stay outside with her but there was nothing to stop children visiting inside.
It's somewhere I'd recommend visiting & I'll be taking my mum there when she visits."
,,Pretty temple,3.0,,"We decided to take our kids on a stroll around Chinatown, although they are both still too young to really understand anything. This temple was one of our stops on the way. Interesting enough with the highlight being the 100 Buddhas in one section of the temple."
,,"Interesting place, beautiful prayer wheel on the roof",4.0,,"A great temple to have a look around, pick up some literature if you're interested, and marvel at the incredible amount of buddha figurines (10,000 I think?) lining the walls, as well as the incredibly ornate room that houses the tooth relic. Very nice place to go and take in a little serenity amongst all the tourism, and make sure you check out the prayer wheel on the roof."
,,A beautiful temple,5.0,,The Temple is worth a visit. Excellent Buddha displays. Great photo opportunities and place to chill out a bit after hectic Chinese market
,,Quite the spectacle,5.0,,"Since it is right in Chinatown, it is worth taking a peek. The walls are decorated with Buddhist iconography. People actually worship there."
,,Informative Temple,3.0,,"I don't usually go to temple except visiting them as tourist attraction. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is one of the temple I will introduce to my visitor if they are here. There are 4 storey of the exhibition cum museum for you to understand history of Buddha.
1st - Prayer section, you may have your prayer there. The temple architecture is quite good too
2nd - can't recall what is this here.
3rd - History of Buddha
4th - The place where they keep the Buddha Tooth
5th - a rooftop garden + a big buddist wheel"
,,New Year Decorated,4.0,,As others I have seen it is always a delight to view the various figurines so very detailed. The hanging lanterns and lights hung as it was New Years simply added to authenticity of being transported to another time.
,,Very colourful,3.0,,"A typical Buddha temple, very colourful. Easy access and worth a look-in. Just outside the China Town market."
,,Top Temple,5.0,,"We visited several Temples and mosques during arecent trip to Singapore, Maylasia and Thailand. This was the finest and richest of these by far. Well worth the visit."
,,First visit to a temple,5.0,,Last morning in Singapore....popped in out of interest. It is an amazing building. Its modern - you have to go to the 2nd and 3rd floors to understand the history of the building (2nd) and history of the Buddha (3rd). I was entranced. And its very informative... if you can - go!
,,Little oasis in bustling Chinatown,4.0,,"A beautiful place to visit. It's very calm and peaceful, and it's very interesting to read about the history. It is over 4 levels and the rooftop gardens and prayer wheel are worth looking at. A place of quiet meditation. Would definitely recommend a visit. Entry is free. You will need to cover your shoulders if you are wearing a sleeveless top, and also if you are wearing shorts or skirts above the knee, however they have scarves there for that purpose."
,,The roof gardens are worth a visit,5.0,,The ground floor temple is really interesting with descriptions of the different gods to choose depending on your birth year. The interior is very splendid. I would recommend a trip up to the roof garden - both my sister and I felt the calmness descend as we stepped into it.
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"Beautiful place of worship. Timing of visit depends on your preference (i.e. liking for crowd). If you would like to have a different experience, you may want to time your visit on special occasions (e.g. Wesak Day or other celebratory days) or when there are on-going prayers / service. Special occasions are also perfect opportunity for visitors to take beautiful photos. Only some areas restrict the use of cameras. After visiting the temple, take a short walk to the nearby hawker centers for awesome local hawker food! (there's one right above the market, and another across the road - Maxwell hawker center)"
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,5.0,,"wonderful place to visit, a place for quiet reflection, in a bustling and busy city, learning about the history and seeing the places of worship and historical exhibits is well worth seeing."
,,Interesting,5.0,,Pleasantly informal in centre with lots of items to view. Strict about no photography in some of the areas. Interesting and worth a visit
,,A must see when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"I always take out-of-towners to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. It's a fascinating place, and if you time it right, first thing in the morning, between 9 and 10 am, there will be less tourists AND you will might get to see a service in progress with the monks. They are very welcoming to visitors and don't mind you taking video or photos, just be respectful and quiet at all times. Remember, if you have bare shoulders and/or legs showing, you must use one of their wraps (at the front entrance) to cover up. Don't worry, if you forget, they will politely remind you."
,,Typical Chinese Temple with Exhibition Venue,4.0,,"I had been there twice. It closes to Chinatown, at city centre. Easy to go by mrt. The building have many storeys with lift access. The upper parts storey shows Buddha tooth and others part of body crystal. You will be amazed when visit."
,,Fascinating,4.0,,This is possibly the most interesting of the Temples in Singapore. Although modern its architecture size and exhibitions give an interesting insight. It is within the Chinese quarter of Singapore giving the added attraction of the bustle and food options typical of china towns. I would add it to your itinerary when next in Singapore
,,Learn About the Life of the Buddha,4.0,,"Interesting display on the life of the Buddha made this temple/museum worth the visit for me.

Some rooms have floor to celing buddhas and there are more relics than just a tooth - intestine relic, brain relic, hair relic, there's relics out the yin-yang in this joint.

Begin your vist by taking the elevator to the tranquil roof garden and work your way down."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,"This temple is very distinctive from other temples in the world. It has both ancient and modern construction. If you want to see ancient and traditional religious temple, this may make you disappointed. If you want to find the Buddha Temple with Singaporean style, you should visit this place."
,,A lovely oasis,4.0,,if you are in Chinatown take 30 mins to explore the temple. It's a welcome oasis right next the the hustle and bustle of the Chinatown markets.
,,Temple,3.0,,"Free for visit . Shorts and sleeveless are prohibited to enter the temple, but scarf and cloth are provided free."
,,One of many,3.0,,This is not the best example of a Buddhist temple we have visited. It has the typical red and gold. But it also has counters selling tourist tat inside which I found a bit distasteful. On the plus side the entrance was reasonably airy and a welcome relief from the humidity but that is not what a temple visit is about!
,,"Buddha tooth relic temple, Singapore",2.0,,Inviting when viewing from outside. But the manner of seeking donation gives me an overwhelming commercial overview. Hence the spiritual element is lost on me.
,,Beautiful and Calm,5.0,,We discovered this place while shopping in Chinatown. A very peaceful place and also we can learn about Buddhism here. Tranquillity!!!
,,Peace and calm is here.,5.0,,This is the best temple that we can do meditation at the roof top floor or in the Buddha Tooth Relic floor.
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"Tour the temple as people chant, meditate, etc. It's very interesting, esp if you have a Buddhist friend to help explain the significance of the statues & chanting. Be sure to visit the museum upstairs.

Come properly dressed w/ pants & sleeves that cover the shoulder. :)"
,,A calming moment,5.0,,"listening to the chanting of the monks for a while is a calming down moment in this busy city. The relic is housed in a bullet proof room and covered in gold, gold, gold."

,,Serene Place,4.0,,"Worth visiting. It is for both devout Buddhists as well as for visitors, especially loved the hundreds of buddhas in their own niches in the walls...."
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"We walked to this temple as we stayed in Little India. It was absolutely beautiful inside. You have to remove your shoes outside as a sign of respect but there is a shoe rack for your shoes and you must be appropriately dressed. Shoulders need to be covered as do legs but they have clothing you can borrow.

You can take pics but there are some areas you cant as its a temple where people come to pray and at times felt like i was being disrespectful by taking [pics when there was people praying but no one was offended.

The art on the walls and ceilings was amazing. I would like to have known more information about various art work though. Defo worth a visit while in Singapore and a cultural experience.

Was disappointed not to see the tooth relic as we had at Big Buddha in Singapore"
,,Spiritual and relaxing,5.0,,"It was a ornate temple with all the gold ornaments, and pergola. I found the temple relaxing and educational. Unfortnately my visit was very rushed and I will visit it again when I am next in Singapore. The toilet facilities were clean unlike some of the ones in Chinatown."
,,My first ever temple experience,4.0,,"Popped in here as it was on my list of things to do/see in Singapore. There was a ceremony going on which we were able to observe, which felt very special and spiritual. The artwork was really amazing as was the museum up on the top of the building."
,,Temples in Singapore,5.0,,"Out of some of d temples which can be of interest to Indians, Buddhas Tooth Relic Temple n Museum is a must see one.Unlike other temples u can approach the main altar with yr shoes on. The atmosphere, ambiance, fragrance and above all d Ruling Deity of Singapore , ones head automatically bows in reverence. One sacred thread that ties all the homo sapiens in this world is the thread of faith and honour for all the religions irrespective of the caste, colour or creed. Pray for the well being of your nears and dears by lightning a candle lamp for a small amount in their currency. If have more time must see the museum on first floor. Can do some souvenir shopping in d adj. market, bargain for right prices."
,,I thought it would be touristy,5.0,,"The place actually has a very spiritual feel about it, these are genuine worshippers going about their devout duties. You must dress respectfully but they will loan you clothes if yours are inappropriate. Its also next to the best china town outside china"
,,interesting and worth the visit,5.0,,"Located in China town , this temple although new is a must see. Lots of interesting artifacts . There will be some Chinese fellow to greet you at the entrance. He will walk with you as you go through the floors. You then realize he is a local not an official guide.Our 'guide' was excellent and seemed to know a lot of the history and spoke good English. He wasn't pushy and was actually very helpful . He then took us to the centre of China Town. We gave him some money for which he didn't ask but probably expected. Well worth the money. They will have shawls and sarong for women free of charge."
,,A Not-To-Be-Missed in SG,5.0,,"For those who have travelled far and wide in South East Asia, Singapore may appear to be a tad bland and sterile. There are not many places in the small island nation which cater to cultural / heritage aficionados. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is indeed a gem of an exception.

Head to Chinatown where it is well located. On the same street as the Sri Mariamman Temple. It certainly deserves to be one of the main attractions in Singapore.

It is worth spending more than a couple of hours here. Start from the roof top where the huge prayer wheel is situated amidst a well-landscaped orchid garden. Use the staircase and work your way down, floor by floor. Down to the next level where the sacred Buddha Tooth is encased and then further down to the well-presented museum which 'tells' you the story of the life of The Enlightened One. The whole building exudes a sense of tranquility and awakening, whether you are a practising Buddhist or not the case may be.

Of course, to many, the temple on the ground floor is the main highlight. But don't miss the dining hall on the basement which is run by volunteers serving simple vegetarian meals. The place is spotless and very popular with the local devotees and visitors alike. Soft drinks available at S$1.00. For the meals, if you were to ask them, you'll be told that it's S$3.00. Otherwise, just put whatever you wish into the donation box in front of the serving counter.

If vegetarian is not your preference, across the road from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple (as you step out from the main temple, it is on your right, across the main road), is the Maxwell Food Centre. There are tons of 'stalls' in there and food to be found there is known to be one of the most authentic in the whole of Singapore."
,,Magic,5.0,,"this place is magical, its very beautiful on the inside, with a lot of buddhas exposed. I was luchy to be there when chants started and it is a very spiritual feeling. A must see with time to get to know everythign in Singapore Chinatown"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This temple looked quite unassuming from the outside, however once inside I was dazzled by the beauty of the decorations.

Whilst walking around I also felt a sense of peace and calmness come over me. Local people were meditating and praying, however I never once felt as if I was intruding.

I visited the gift shop and the gentleman serving there was extremely accommodating and friendly even though I only purchased a small, inexpensive keepsake."
,,Best Buddha temple in Singapore,4.0,,Very impressive and must see attratcion. It has a nice atmosphere if you like buddhisms. You can meditate and can have a bless in the storey.
,,Mandatory visit,4.0,,Mandatory visit to go and check out the relics in this temple. The temple it self has a great design.
,,MAY BE NEW BUT EXCELLENT MUSEUM,5.0,,"We visited here on an organised tour a couple of years ago and only saw the temple on the ground floor. We went again this time on our own and could explore the whole building. It is an amazing place. From the gardens on the top floor with its huge prayer wheel, through the Buddha Tooth Relic sanctuary and the museum that relates the life of the Buddha to the first floor, I found it quite fascinating. You really need a couple of hours here to take it all in."
,,So much to see,5.0,,The Temple and museum have many floors to explore. We popped in to see the relic and were there for hours. Enjoyed it very much.
,,Very spiritual,5.0,,"Very spiritual place to visit. They have shawls and sarongs, at the door to put on, as you venture inside. The chanting of the monks is lovely to hear. The carvings are lovely."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"An impressively opulent temple - well worth a visit. Don't let all the gold blind you to the beautiful silk paintings and needlework!
I had a bit the same reaction as when visiting the Vatican - I find the austentatious wealth of some religious institutions a bit nauseating."
,,Great to learn the story of Buddhism,5.0,,"This museum was a nice surprise. There are several levels to explore, including a roof top terrace. There were ceremonies happening while we were there. One of the levels has a great history of Buddhism, that is very clear and not overly long.

They had shawls and wraps available for us to cover our shorts and tank tops.

Try Old Nanyang Coffee a block away."
,,Awesome,5.0,,don't miss this! Go to the rooftop and see the golden stupa. Really awesome vastu.Take time and go to the museum in 3rd floor to see more and also you will be able to relate to Hindu culture
,,Temple,5.0,,"Our trip included Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This temple was the best one we visited and a visit to each floor of the pagoda is critical to see all of the artifacts. It can easily take 3 hours to see it all."
,,"If you are in Chinatown in Singapore, please visit this temple",5.0,,"You will form your own ideas of the temple. But you should visit if you are in Singapore's Chinatown. There are several levels, so visit all.
If you like to meditate, this is a great place to do so, whatever your religion.
Take time to visit the museum portion to learn about the life and travels of Buddha.
Look near the entrance for the free books on Buddhism. If you take a couple, consider making a small donation to the temple, although donations are not necessary.
Buddhism is an important part of Asian history and culture. This is a great and enjoyable way to learn about it."
,,Peaceful Palce.,5.0,,"As the name suggests, its a Buddhist temple, located in the center of China Town, nice place to meditate."
,,Fascinating and inspirational,5.0,,We arrived during a period of worship and felt very privileged to experience this dedication. A most beautiful place.
,,Serene and peaceful,5.0,,"I brought my friends who visited Singapore to this temple.

Initially I thought this is a commercial temple but when i took time to visit the temple myself. I read about the history and visited the museum. It totally changed my perception.

Its a great place to go and learn about buddhist teachings, artifacts and history.

Its worth to spend time to visit."
,,Stunning how much there is to see,4.0,,"Just the temple part is a sight, add to this some incredible photos on stairs, serene rooftop garden and informative museum with many interesting Buddha and Buddha-related art pieces (mainly sculpture). Very informative if you want to learn more about Buddha and Buddhism."
,,A tranquil temple,5.0,,"We stumbled across this temple on an evening out in Chinatown. So many Buddhas inside and wraps are provided for you to cover up, if like me you arrived in a sundress. We were not rushed, were encouraged to photograph if we wanted to and were able to light our incense sticks as we left. A beautifully set out temple. One of the best Buddhist temples we have visited."
,,Serenity,5.0,,A must-go-place for both Buddhist and tourist. A very peaceful place for peace of mind while keeping a colorful sense of decoration. Make sure to have plenty of time to explore the entire place and allow yourself to spend time in the meditation room. Must go!
,,A beautiful temple but much more,5.0,,"This is a real gem in Singapore even for non-Buddhists. The main temple is gorgeous and always busy. The upstairs relic temple is a great, peaceful retreat as is the rooftop garden. Add to this a library, restaurant and quality bookstore and you will want to spend more than a short visit."
,,Visit the dining hall!,4.0,,"I'm not sure if there are clear signs leading to the dining hall at basement 1, but you may enter by going down the stairs at the side of the temple nearest to the open-air carpark.

The dining hall seats about 100 people. Pick from fried bee hoon (thin rice noodles), white rice or brown rice, and as many dishes as you'd like that's on display. All are vegetarian.

When I last visited for lunch, I was charged $3 for bee hoon, curry veg, stir fried marrow with mushroom and mock meat with lemon sauce (lemon ""chicken""). Free serving of soup and dessert of the day. It was near noon, so I also witnessed the monks having their meals. It was a ceremony of sorts, where devotees present them with food off a tray held by the temple staff, and they chant prayers before they eat.

My colleague who went on a separate occasion shared that the dining hall staff did not let him know the price of his food, but instead requested that he contribute whatever amount he wished into a donation box at the end of the counter."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"It's beautiful, so pleased we visited. It's a very impressive temple, very colourful and ornate. There are 5 floors including a roof top garden, so much to see - make sure you allow yourself plenty of time for the visit and the 4 floors above close at 6pm. Entry is free. to enter"
,,Buddhist temple,5.0,,"Very Beautiful and Well Maintained ! Very Peaceful and Traditional. Whether you would like to worship or just admire the temple, this place should not be missed !"
,,A good place for religion visit,5.0,,"A very serene place, peaceful, beautiful and have a lot of buddha statues for photo taking. On the B1, they also sell good vegetarian food like mixed vegetables rice, and Wanton noodles. If you choose to visit, do remember to wear proper attire like short sleeves shirt and long pants. But if you choose to wear sleeveless or shorts, do not worry, the temple provide sarong and scarf for you to cover up yourselves."
,,Do not miss this!,5.0,,"Fantastic, beautiful temple - the staff there were really helpful and informative and pointed lots of things that were not apparent upon first look. The walk through history museum on Buddism is a highlight - beautiful relics and artefacts and explains the origins of Budda and Buddism."
,,A Mysterious Hand Appeared in My Photograph!,4.0,,"This temple in the heart of Singapore is said to house a tooth (or rather some teeth) of Buddha. The teeth are placed on an altar on the top floor of the temple, and too far for the naked eye to see. Two TV screens on either side of the altar show the teeth - I think they are molars. Apart from the teeth, the temple has good collections of Buddhist memorabilia, and well worth patient browsing and reflections, even if you are not a Buddhist, for an understanding of a religion which has a history longer than Christianity's. I took two photographs of the altar on the ground level with an Iphone 6, and lo and behold, whilst the first photograph appears normal, the second shows a mysterious black veil-like object, with what appears to be a white arm holding it up. My devout Buddhist friend who was with me at that time, said that the mysterious object was a spirit who was there to worship Buddha. The mystery is yet unresolved!"
,,Worth going,5.0,,"This is a sacred Buddha temple. Please dress modestly. There are shawls and wraparounds available for free use and return at the entrance. The temple is gorgeous with details of each of the deities, the architecture and the ambiance is fantastic. Enjoy in peace."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"This was a very interesting foray. Loved the colour and the feel of the museum, as well as all the interesting things around the walls."
,,Good experience,4.0,,We found this place very close to our hotel and we are glad we did. We arrived in the middle of a service which was incredible to watch. Each floor offers something different including a beautiful roof top garden. Well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful and busy,5.0,,"This temple is certainly one the high lights of Singapore.. But extremely busy with tourists. Being respectful is very important here, don't wear sleeveless clothing or short dresses or shorts, as you will be asked to cover up.. It is normal for all temples for this is a sign of respect. My hubby had a quick look as he was loaded down with shopping as ""chinatown"" is right next door... I took almost an hour to view the temple.. As I love photography.. Which is allowed.. Toilets are in the basement. This temple is 5 floors above ground and 3 floors below ground... Quite amazing..security is at the door to the temple to ask any questions... This temple has two entries...just follow the flow of people in and out..."
,,Beautyful Temple,4.0,,"We hv the pleasure to visit this temple during our visit to singapore last september.Really beatyful temple.Nicely crafted.Lots of metal work n they sparkle a lot too.Outer view also very beautyful.N the location,no1 will forget to.Just infront of China town.Overall its an beautyful temple in a lovely location.Its worth visiting there"
,,Truly Amazing,5.0,,"This was really magical and wonderful to see and just spend time looking at all the Buddha's, we left feeling very cleansed and uplifted. Make sure you go to the roof garden as many people miss this."
,,What a wonderful place !,5.0,,"Passed by this temple several times before going in to have a look.
If we had missed this place then we would have been kicking ourselves, it was absolutely brilliant. Greeted by the chanting of
Buddhist monks the walls and ceilings are covered in elaborate and beautifully decorated painted images of over one hundred buddha statues and too many other deities to give an accurate number it would run into hundreds. The outside of the building
is painted red and white with many windows and individual .roofs, set off the South Bridge road , accessible from the market stalls in Chinatown. There is also a little shop attached to the temple where cd's and deity items can be purchased.
Whatever you do in Singapore visit here !"
,,Amazing look into history,5.0,,"Although fairly new this temple has lots of information, a beautiful rooftop garden, a gallery and a mini museum. You can take photos thought most of the temple and they have shawls and wrap around skirts if you aren't dressed appropriately. Great spot right in the middle of Chinatown"
,,Quite an experience ...,4.0,,I thought we would be allowed in to look around ... And we were but it was full of people chanting and praying with a full-on service in progress so not what we expected. We were even allowed to take photographs while the service was in session ... There were loads of tourists doing the same. Quite the norm! Very interesting.
,,Beautiful temple - don't miss it!,5.0,,This temple is beautiful and definitely worth visiting. It is also free! Highly decorated and well looked after in a lovely building. It doesn't take long to look around but definitely worth a visit and so is the rest of china town. You can also take photos inside.
,,good,4.0,,lots of buddha minatures and figures. from chinatown station is about 15 minutes walk along busy shops
,,Serenity and peace,5.0,,"Always return here each visit and never let down by helpful staff, atmosphere is peaceful and services a delight to watch. Very caring congregation"
,,MAGNIFICENT,5.0,,"I have seen many Buddhist Temples around the world but they all fade into insignificance when put alongside this one. There are 5 Floors of interesting things to see from the daily chantings on Level 1 through to the beautiful rooftop garden of 1000 Buddhas on Level 5.

I thought the best was on Level 4 which houses the Buddha relic. The colours and fabulous paintings are something to behold and it is so quiet and serene you feel truly at peace here.

For a non-Buddhist I found the whole experience to be something special."
,,Amazing Temple,5.0,,"It is too beautiful for words you gotta see it-all floors up to the Buddha's Tooth Gold Tomb. I like everything about the exhibits, statutes, mandalas, etc. All Buddhist paraphernalia except enlightenment."
,,So ornate,4.0,,This temple is so beautiful and has a really serine feeling to it. A great place to stop and soak up the peacefulness before the madness of the Chinese markets which are also fabulous.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,For me as a non-Buddhist was an amazing experience - lucky enough to be there during a ceremony with Buddhist monks playing music. Was surprised how welcome a stranger that is not there for religious purposes is let to walk in and move around. I was fascinated to see all the beautiful interior and Buddha statues.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,What a place !!! We were totally amazed with the beautiful design and the colours are so vibrant. There are three floors of which one is the roof terrace. The second floor details how the temple was built and the ground floor is the temple. you must to go to see this. It's in Chinatown next to the tourist information centre.
,,Delightful - and Welcoming,5.0,,Though one is not a Buddhist one still feels very welcome at this splendid shrine. It is spectacular in the extreme in aesthetic terms but there is also a joyousness about it that one carries away afterwards.Not to be missed!
,,Hello?,2.0,,"Please... Do a little research before you go. Sure the place is nice, but the ""tooth"" is of ""bovine"" origin according to scientists, so the word SCAM comes to mind..."
,,Wow!,5.0,,Absolutely gorgeous. The details and colors are beautiful. Be sure and cover up your shoulders and don't wear shorts - or learn the hard way like me and have to wear an awkward sarong and scarf provided by the temple. Must see in Singapore!
,,Rare opportunity,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Museum is a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of Buddha Tooth Relic which can be seen with the naked eye .There is also a close up video display of the relic which is very rare. The temple itself has beautiful architecture carvings and decorations. The chamber which holds the relic is very peaceful and has space for meditation. On one floor is the museum which has many artifacts with explanations. The surrounding area which is the China Town is worth a walk through to see traditional Chinese arts and crafts
,,sacred and interesting place,3.0,,"It was interesting for my friend and I, when we just crossing by this museum and slightly enter the temple. I can see how the buddhist people really respect this place, and we are allowed to watch their ritual ceremony and see the buddha tooth relic at upper level. Not just that, it was also a museum which display lots of buddha relics from other countries and other things related. There is also a big thing on top of the roof, like a huge bell as part of ritual prayer for the buddhist by pushing it around with saying sacred prayers.
For those who crossed by chinatown and interested in buddhist temple and its rituals, it is recommended place to visit."
,,Buddha Temple,3.0,,"Nice place, but I had difficulty understanding what was going on. There were four floors of display, but I was confused about where to go, or what it meant."
,,Get ready to be amazed,5.0,,"Because of limited time I only managed to do the first floor. I was stunned by the beauty of all the artefacts.
With the rich colours of red and gold.

You could simply spend hours here looking at all the offerings from fruit to candles and flowers. The smell is beautiful. They appear to allow you to take photographs in most areas. But not in the memory of the dead. It was very moving watching people remembering their loved ones.

Please make sure your knees are covered up they do provide wraps for this purpose.

I think my photos some up the pure beauty and spiritual feeling of this Temple.

I feel it's a very fine example. It's free to enter but you can make a donation.

When I return I would love to visit the other floors."
,,A must!,5.0,,"A fascinating place to visit. Start from rooftop and work your way down. The rooftop is an oasis of garden and I think ancestor wall and prayer wheel. You wouldn't realized the noise from the road below. Then there's the Sacred Buddha tooth relic room which monks pray in every month. Please observed the taking off shoes in here. The main prayer hall on first hall consist of 2 rooms. Other floor consist museum of the different sculptures Buddha, deities and artifacts of different countries. At one of the floor at the back dedicated to the ancestral room. Be observed that short and bare shoulder is disrespectful!"
,,An Excellent Buddhist Temple - Lots to see and very atmospheric.,4.0,,"This is a relatively 'new' temple as it was only completed in 2007 at a cost of about GB£25Million. Built to house the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha it is in Chinese Tang Dynasty style and is on several levels. Access to the upper levels is via stairs or elevator.

The Temple building also houses a museum with some nice artefacts and some great photographs in the corridors as well.and on the top floor there is a peaceful orchid garden and the Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel which is the biggest cloisonné prayer wheel in the world.

The main temple itself is very impressive with hundreds of individually made Buddha statues. The colours are amazing and the cultural ambience is superb... A real temple experience that should be in the top 5 of things to see when visiting Singapore."
,,A Great Buddhist temple!,5.0,,"Very well managed temple with lots of historical Buddha statue.Do have conducted tours of the temple but have to book in advance.A must visit place especially for a Buddhist,which can learn more about the teaching of Buddhism.I visit this temple every fortnight and enjoy every moment at the temple.There is always a piece of mind n feel peaceful when at the temple.Amitofu!"
,,An interesting insight,5.0,,"Well worth a visit as this temple gives you an under-the-covers view of a working Buddhist temple. We went around 11:00 and there happened to be a chanting service underway. Make sure you go to the 4th floor to see the tooth, and then go to the roof garden to admire the orchids and the largest prayer wheel in the world."
,,A highlight of Chinatown,5.0,,"This is an absolutely lovely temple right on the edge of Chinatown. The vibrant colors are wonderful and we defy anyone to count the images of Buddha inside. We were fortunate enough to be there during services, and it creates a stunning atmosphere."
,,Fits well in Singapore's Chinatown,5.0,,"After having walked for many hours through Chinatown experiencing the Chinese atmosphere with its many small shops and food places, it fits to end your tour with a visit to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. The temple is in use and attracts lots of people, locals as well as tourists. It's quite an experience to watch the praying and ceremonies."
,,Surprisingly interesting and fine temple,5.0,,"You expect to find great temples in Myanmar, Bhutan, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia. It's what they do. But Singapore....not so much.

Well....actually, go see this one. It's the full gilded Monty, big, multi-storey and gold and red everywhere. The main hall full of Buddha statues, the garden up top, the back area with the altar for the supposed tooth itself - well worth it.

In Singapore, one is so often feels nothing is genuine and everybody is just striving for the 4 Cs....come here and it's almost a mystical experience that will convince you that there is, or at least was, more to this place."
,,new temple but lot to see,5.0,,"budda's relic, tooth only air con buddish temple I have ever met"
,,Mystical place,5.0,,"Walking around the Singapur Chinatown you have to visit this Temple and museum. It is a place where people of different faiths could find time for reflection. You can find there rich collection of images of Buddha. At the ground floor there are sculptures of Buddha dedicated to all of the Chinese zodiacs signs (it’s worth to know what is your Chinese zodiac sign :-)). Each of the floors is worth to see, especially the roof where you can find beautiful garden.
After visiting the Temple you can go to Maxwell Road, where you can find a market hall with a variety of local food."
,,Magical place,5.0,,Must see. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a Buddhist temple and museum complex located in the Chinatown district of Singapore. You can very cultural experience to Buddhism. Place is beautiful. Garden on top is magical. Hop-on-Hop-off stop is right in front of the temple.
,,Awesome temple,5.0,,Huge Buddhist temple in the middle of Chinatown that houses a relic of Buddha's tooth. The interior rooms are beautiful and ornate. The staff is also very friendly and helpful and let us know about events at the temple. Don't miss the entire ground floor and the relic room. The roof garden and prayer wheel are also very cool.
,,A lot of miniature Budha Figures,3.0,,"Just located near the China town food street center. The architecture from outside may look like from ancient Chinese dynasty but actually it is a modern museum temple building. There is elevator to reach upper floors.
This pretty big temple housing a lot of historical Buddhist figures and mementos, with each detail description following, which is quite informing.
It is air conditioned room, so it is quite comfort
On the top of the floor there is zen garden which is quite beautiful."
,,Beautiful temple with a peaceful rooftop oasis,4.0,,"I really enjoyed exploring the Chinatown area of Singapore, in particular walking through the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and sitting in the gardens on the rooftop, a great place to rest your feet and just enjoy some peace away from the crowds. You can read more and view some photos here: https://travellingomnomnivore.wordpress.com/2014/10/12/singapore-chinatown/"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Not authentic concrete building. Being one of the top highlights of Singapore (Chinatown) in many guidebooks, I had expected a top ranking classic temple which was entirely not the case. The Golden Buddha tooth being exhibited on the 4th floor of a concrete kind of appratment building, that you can reach with an elevator was the top kitch experience of my trip."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"I thought this was a lovely place and a sight to see. Never seen that many Buddha's in one place! ;-). All the bigger statues being different with really nice detail.
After this a visit to the Noodle Shop is recommended and watch hin make your noodles to order."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Situated in Chinatown visiting this buddhist temple is a wonderful experience,the idols the paintings on the ceiling are something to be seen to be belived, I do not have words to describe will take help of pictures to describe the temple.The temple has two gates enter from one side of the temple and come out from the other side a better experience."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"It was an interesting visit and it broke up our visit to china town.
It was great to see and experience.

No food or drink to be consumed in here and they have sarongs at the entry for women to cover their legs if not wearing covering above the knee."
,,awesome,5.0,,"must see Buddhist Temple in Chinatown. Be quiet, show respect, and bring money for offerings. It's spectacular."
,,Speccy,5.0,,The sheer amount of colour in this temple is amazing. Be respectful and be quiet. No place for bogans.
,,magnificent new temple,5.0,,"i love this temple. every country i go to, i have to visit as many temples i can see. this temple is magnificent! clean, fragrant, beautiful colors and the energy is bright and positive."
,,Good knowledge,5.0,,The gallery on 2nd floor and the museum on 3rd floor gives you some knowledge about Buddha history. There is a little orchid garden on the rooftop.
,,Spiritual Hub,5.0,,Really loved the colour atmosphere and cultural sense this temple had including the ceremony and the drums it was very traditional. Interesting there is a gift shop inside. Overall found it an uplifting experience and good learning. The gold was very ornate.
,,Too good,4.0,,"it was pleasure going around the temple, its very beautiful..... toooo gooodddd...must visit... near China town."
,,Beautiful and Peaceful in midst of busy area,5.0,,"The temple is absolutely beautiful. The fact that this is a functioning temple and still has information and ability for tourist to learn and enjoy makes it a great find. It is very peaceful and solemn, well maintained and a wonderful find."
,,Educational and historic,4.0,,Nice to see the history and the many exhibits at this museum in the heart of the city. Easily accessed by the MRT
,,Go For The Tooth,5.0,,I missed the tooth temple the first time I came here. Kindly check up the timings and do not miss out the tooth temple upstairs. Most of the tourists miss out. You can shoot pictures downstairs but not upstairs. Check out also the rooftop garden.
,,Pretty temple - a bit of peace in busy Chinatown,4.0,,"We were lucky enough to catch a service when we visited, so we had some beautiful chanting / singing to accompany our visit. A beautiful building, that feels a lot older than it is. A lovely escape from the hectic Chinatown just outside."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Right in the centre if Chinatown, this free temple is absolutely worth the visit. It's beautiful inside and out and the peacefulness from the outside madness is refreshing. Be sure to get the lift to ever floor and walk up steps to roof garden just beautiful."
,,What a find! Made our 4th visit to Singapore worthwhile!,5.0,,"We had an entire 24 hours in Singapore before our flight back home, so we thought of staying in Chinatown and digging into some yummy chilli and pepper crabs! While loitering down the alleyways we chanced upon this beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown. Not the ones to walk away without a peek, we inched towards the temple with our baby in tow and shopping bags in hand. We gasped at the first sight of the main temple! It was ""beautiful"" and even though crowded, it was serene. Yes women need to cover up as a sign of respect. I was given a stole by a monk at the entrance to cover up my arms which was totally fine with me. Being an avid traveller I understand and respect that each country comes with its set of tradition and culture which makes it unique from the country we are born and live in. By and large, one of the most beautiful contemporary temples I have visited. It's just over a decade old but it has the charm that is typical to a Buddhist temple. Must visit!"
,,Clean and peaceful Buddha Temple,5.0,,"A must see in Singapore .....shopping, centosa and hundreds of attractions, but this is yet another one which ranks high on a must see"
,,Impressive Buddhist Temple I've ever seen,5.0,,"The temple is very well kept in very good condition. If you visit this place, make sure you have time to visit all the four floors, including basement and the roof garden on top of the temple. It is good to make some offerings when you visit temples. Flowers, food and candles are placed at the front desk in the Front or Rear Courtyard to be sold to visitors.

There are some rules you might find it useful when entering the temple. Bare backs, off-shoulders, shorts, mini-skirts, pets and non-vegetarian food are seriously not allowed inside the temple. If you are not prepared, you could borrow the long robes/cloth from the temple, which are placed at the side way near the entrance.

There are the statues of One Hundred Buddhas, which are individually handcrafted by several sculptors, sitting on the two sides of the hall. There is a staff sitting behind the cashier at the entrance corner offering coins change for visitor who would like to make offerings to each of the Buddha. The staff will hand you a bowl with 100 coins of $0.10 if you exchange a $10 SG dollar bill with him.

The stairways and lift are hidden at the corner of the entrance of the ground floor. You might not view it at first sight. It is worth to visit upstairs, as there are museum, meditation room hall and precious Buddhism relics at different floors. A roof garden is on the top of the building, also, there is vegetarian lunch set at the basement of the temple. The place is clean and comfortable. If you like greens and healthy food, this place is right for you.

I would recommend this temple and museum to everyone as this is very different from the other Buddhist Temple you see in other place."
,,Great!,5.0,,An oasis in the middle of mad Singapore! Free to get in. So clean and ordered. The roof top garden is worth a trip. Museum floor very interesting and well laid out. Tooth Relic room is serene. Worth a visit.
,,Place for peace and learning,4.0,,"Walkable from China Town MRT, Budha Tooth Relic temple is a four storey building which one cannot miss. While this looks similar to most of the common Budhist temples, this temple is based on TANG dynasty architectural style and is ornate and colorful.

The most significant feature of the temple is the two-meter tall solid gold stupa that weighs about 420 kg located at the top floor, in the Sacred Light Hall. It is the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic Chamber, which is the repository of the sacred Buddha tooth.Only the monks have access to the inner chamber. However visitors are able to observe it from the viewing gallery twice a day, at 9:00 am to 12:00 noon and again at 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm, during the ceremonies conducted by the monks.( Please check the timings)

Open from 9 AM to 6 Pm on all days, you can comfortably spend an hour there if you are interested about Budhist culture. The museum has plenty of visitors and you have to adjust yourselves for the required mental peace at some places but you have an elevator to take to various floors.

Dont miss the museum in the first floor which has lot of sculptures describing the history of Budha, the Budhist cultural museum and Sanga Museum if you are interested and could find time.

The side streets in and around the temple are the best place in china town to go for souvenirs, gifts and give always priced between $1 to you name it value. The street food corners are also famous for tasty and economic food.

Dont miss the Sri Mariamman temple adjacent to this and Layan Sidhi Vinayakar Temple at about half a km walking distance"
,,a little disappointing,3.0,,This temple is very much like any other buddist temple we have visited though it seemed to be well attended
,,Interesting cultural experience,4.0,,"As an European, you don't have that many opportunities to walk into a temple like this. It was a very interesting experience, all the more we got there during a religious service and yet we were allowed to go in. There are texts in English explaining what you see, so go for it."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,There was a service in progress when we arrived but it was still possible to move quietly around the building and take in the amazing decorations and architecture.
,,Don't miss this one when you visit Chinatown,5.0,,"Very elaborate temple - only had the chance to have a quick peek inside while waiting for Tour East bus to depart. Would like to have participated in the free tour (Saturdays? - dates/times displayed on a board inside) but had other pre-booked tours on my agenda. Having been to the Temple of the Tooth in Sri Lanka, would like to have compared the two temples."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Is one of the most amazing temples i've ever seen. Even if the outside looks quite neutral..inside is spectacular!
,,a very interesting Buddhist temple,4.0,,"I chanced upon this temple while exploring the Duxton hill, Neil road area. A very intricately-designed temple, one is free to enter it, just observe the rules posted outside. Ouside there is a big vessel(?) where one can light incense before entering the temple. Very quiet place, great place to do some meditation even if you are not a Buddhist. Excellent place to take some great pictures. A real feast for the eyes."

,,Magical,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was really amazing.
I found it really interesting touring around the temple.
Don't neglect to visit all the floors, including the roof that are the 100 Buddhas with a bit of garden. And a bit of the history also in the 3rd floor, i think, with the story of Buddha and how he come on earth. I found that really interesting to learn.
I visit during the monks where chanting. Nice.
And is at the beginning of the chinatown bazaar. Great location!"
,,Superb and friendly,5.0,,"The inside of the temple is something to behold with all the Buddhas and decoration, and the museum is a great place to read up and get started on the faith if you want to.

I caught the guards asking some girls to cover their shoulders and one girl turned away with a thigh length skirt, so ladies if you are going, they are serious about being covered up.

The staff were really helpful in guiding around, explaining everything and giving the best directions.

The streets are great to wander around as well so take some time to mooch about and get some feel outside of the skyscrapers."
,,Pleasant. instructive,5.0,,"We had booked several tours in Singapore. Some stopped at the Buddha Temple. Being Singapore. Safe.Clean,pleasant and non threatening.

,,A Hidden Gem,5.0,,"There is so much of information which you can gather about the Buddhism religion from the Temple and Museum. Starting from the basement level, the dining hall (Hall of 5 Contemplations) serves affordable vegetarian food. Level 1 is the main shrine with huge Buddha statues. Admire the great internal architecture. Mezzanine level is a corridor gallery that displays the names of Venerable who had contributed greatly to the building of the religion in Singapore. Level 2 comprises of a seminar room and a gallery explaining the process of constructing the temple. Level 3 is a museum detailing the story of Shayamuni Buddha and in the centre of the hall, you get to see the Buddha relics. Level 4 is another quiet grand hall where you can receive blessing from a Venerable. The place is used for mediation too. Taking a short walk up to Level 5, it is a roof-top garden. The key highlight is the huge Dharma wheel. The treasures are within the building. Do come and explore the temple!"
,,Only needs a quick visit,5.0,,"There was a ceremony on when we went at night time so we could not enter the temple fully, but what we did see was lovely , but it was busy and you have to remove your shoes. Worth a look when you are in a China a Town but I would not rush there."

,,Spiritual,5.0,,"It has 4 floors. There is a prayer room on the ground floor(there are timings for prayers). Then there are 2 floors of museum with sculptures depicting Buddha's journey of life.
Top floor has a meditation room which according to me is the best part of this place. Make sure you sit on one of the cushions in the corner and meditate for sometime while Buddhist chants are being played in background.
Visit the terrace to see the huge prayer wheel and walk around the garden.

The board outside mentioned that temple closes at 7pm."

,,Mesmerising!,5.0,,"This place is must visit when you are in Singapore. Its a 4 story structure with Terrace & basement. They allow you to come inside the temple even during their payer times. You are allowed to click pictures but needless to say that you must not use flash. On the terrace , they have this little orchid garden which is beautiful. You will find so much peace at this temple that you might forget to click pictures. Please don't wear half pants or sleeveless clothing since its not allowed when you are visiting this temple. Behind this temple starts the china town lane for your shopping spree...overall the place should be in your must visit list :)"
,,"peaceful breath, peaceful steps",4.0,,"Go to the 4th floor where you can sit quietly to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and feel the presence of Buddha. There is also a rooftop where there is an Orchid garden. I enjoy the museum on the history of the Buddha on the 3rd floor where there are many relics and statues. This is both a temple and a museum, so it is like a 2 in 1. Located near Chinatown, it also has air-conditioning- a good refuge on a hot day! Admission is free. You may like to make a token donation to help support the running of the temple."
,,nice place to visit,5.0,,"lots of things to see. there is a vegetarian food canteen in the basement floor.you can have a good meat there if you want,"
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is a truly beautiful place to visit . My husband had to work so I ventured into Chinatown on my own so glad I did . It's free to get into this temple and it is truly stunning . There are parts you can't take photos but for the most you can . Watching all the monks and people pray was very moving as well
,,Beautiful complex,5.0,,"There is a lot to explore at this temple and museum. Plan to spend at least an hour exploring the temple, the neighborhood and just soaking in the beauty of this building."
,,A little bit of quiet in all the crowd,5.0,,"Located in Chinatown this temple is real treasure, for a moment you can escape from Chinatown streets and admire all sculptures made with such precision. If you are lucky - you can be a part of traditional songs."
,,Sacred place in China town,5.0,,"Day 2 in Singapore travelling to China town, I was most impressed by Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. It was the most posing & outstanding construction in the area. The temple is actually quite small but has tall roof. I only spent around 20' to visit the whole place.
Note: non- Buddhist."
,,A must visit location when in Singapore,5.0,,"We have been living in Singapore for around 9 months and my wife has visited the museum on a few occasions. One weekend I decided to tag along. This place is beautiful with amazing works of arts and sculptures. A rich history and keen advisor are around to help you navigate the museum.

This is one of the ""must visit"" locations when in Singapore, remember your camera and ladies wear longer dresses or trousers."
,,Artificial temple,3.0,,This just amzing how they can build their own attractions. NIec to see that but it is built in early 2000.
,,Stunning place,5.0,,"Extraordinarily beautiful interior, with some gorgeous statues and displays, and this wonderful wall of buddhas of all different expressions and poses. A peaceful, spiritual atmosphere, one that I would return to each time I'm in Singapore."
,,Vibrant colours and sculptures,4.0,,"Its a beautiful temple with the most ornately decorated golden and red sculptures, one almost feels like they 've transcended to another world in here. The meditation centre on the upper levels makes the experience even more relaxing. Anyone can go in and meditate for a while in the midst of beautiful ambience. Short clothes and even bare arms are not allowed in here so be sure to cover up with the stoles provided at the entrance. Its a must do on your visit to chinatown."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,"Close to busy Chinatown area, you can isolate yourself in peace and quiet. Well maintained, although a bit touristy."
,,Places Of Worship,4.0,,"In Singapore we've freedom of worship. Besides visiting tourist attractions like the Esplanade, Merlion Park, Shopping, The Buddha Tooth Relics Temple is situated in Chinatown. A must visit for tourist and locals alike."
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,The most incredible place I've been to. Incredibly ornate gold plated decorations. Go and visit if you have the time!

,,Fascinating Temple,5.0,,We stumbled across the temple rather that planned to visit but so glad we did. Listened to the Monks and amazed by the colourful artifacts. Very peaceful.
,,More than just a temple,5.0,,"A very popular tourist destination besides china town heritage of Singapore, a big draw for the tourists! On the 4th floor, an ideal place to practice calm abiding meditation and unleashed your inner strength with the blessings of the supreme energy around you while practising meditation!"
,,Holy Place with Astounding Architecture,4.0,,"The entrance hall was reverberating with prayers being conducted on the morning that I visited. I would suggest that you don't wear shorts or short skirts or even singlets as it's prohibited, but don't worry, the temple custodians provide a sarong to wrap yourselves.

The main attraction is upstairs, on the fourth floor. The Buddha tooth relic is placed here. There is also an astounding museum of Buddhist art and sculpture on the 3rd floor. Incidentally, the museum also houses the other Buddha relics. It also charts the history of Buddhism over the world.

Good place to go for a meditative and peaceful visit."
,,Excellent experience.,5.0,,"We went on a Sunday right in the middle of a religious service. It was a very interesting experience. The staff at the temple were very kind and let us take a lot of pictures, they understand that the temple happens to be a touristic attraction. It is important for the ladies to not wear revealing clothes, however, if needed, you can borrow something to cover yourself properly at the entry. Really a must if you haven't been to a Buddhist temple yet."
,,"Beautiful, Very Serene atmosphere.",4.0,,"We visited on the very first day of our recent Singapore tour.

I planned in such a way that I visited it after I visited BreakOut Game, which is nearby to this temple.

We reached around 3 pm and maybe spent about 60 minutes.

As you go into the temple you will notice one hundred Buddha’s that have been individually hand sculptured on both sides of the main hall. Each Buddha is different in posture. The bright turquoise blue that emerges from behind the statue provides a very celestial view.

The mezzanine floor exhibits wax figurines monks of eminence while the second floor is an exhibition hall that houses religious art exhibitions featuring calligraphy, paintings and sculptures.

The third floor is where the Nagapuspa Buddhist Culture Museum is. Here you can learn about Buddhism from different countries namely Sri Lanka, Indonesia, China and Tibet

On the 4th floor of the temple and placed in a stupa made from 320kg of gold donated by the devotees.

We also wanted to visit the nearby, Sri Mariamman Temple, but could not due to lack of time.

Should you visit:
Yes, if you happen to visit Chinatown and if you have time. If lack of time, you can give it a skip."
,,An enormous structure in the middle of chinatown.,5.0,,We visited this temple in the middle of a cultural festival so the flower displays were beautiful. It's a large temple thats difficult to photograph in one shot.
,,centre of china town,5.0,,"We have been there accidentally. All tour operators operate from there. So, tourists are dropped here from respective hotels. I like the idea that shoes are allowed in Chinese temples unlike the Indian ones. But you cant wear shorts in there. You get something to wrap around there itself at the entrance. the outside is full of lanterns hanging with the names of people who must have donated the same.."
,,Beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown,5.0,,"Beautiful buddist architecture in this temple. Located in chinatown along a row of houses of worship (synagogue, musjid, Hindu temple), this temple was a cool and pretty sanctuary from the heat and humidity. Loved the quiet chanting in the background, the smell of incesce burning the the well decorated walls of buddha's statues.
As in all houses of worship, please remember to cover shoulders and legs (women) and no hats (men). Photos are allowed."
,,Nice Cultural Site,4.0,,"This is one of the few sites in Singapore where there isn't a charge. They allow you to take plenty of photos even while services are occurring; just be respectful and don't interrupt. Most people just walk through, which takes about 10 minutes. However, if you use the elevators/stairs found down a hallway at either end of the building, you can go to the upper floors. Three of them are museums, including the room that hold's Buddha's tooth. The roof has a nice garden and a prayer wheel. Around the temple is lots of shop stalls, with goods generally cheaper than in other parts of Singapore, though they are not air conditioned, so be prepared for the heat."
,,Excellent Temple for a Visit,5.0,,"Beautiful modern temple which often has events or services going on. What makes it stand out from many other temples in Asia (yes, the place is packed with lots of big and fantastic temples) include the 4th floor museum which holds an amazing array of artefacts from around the Buddhist world including some quite rare pieces with good descriptions - indeed all around there is good signing in English and Chinese), the peaceful roof garden with prayer wheel, and the open areas for private meditation, and a range of talks in both Mandarin and English which they advertise. With a family with two young children we spent well over an hour looking round and interacting with the place."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,We were there at 10am in time to see monks holding ceremony and it was delightful. Make sure you take lift to top and have a look at the roof-top garden when there.
,,Visit if in Chinatown,4.0,,Literally hundreds of Buddhas. This temple is a place of worship ans ceremonies are going on all the time. Very serene and peaceful.
,,1000 Buddhas,5.0,,Quite nice looking temple from the outside and inside. many many little Buddhas inside. Worth a visit since you´re in chinatown anyway!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"What a fascinating place this temple has such character to see all the monks and others praying inside was really quite special.
Inside is very beautiful a peaceful and very holy atmosphere and very interesting as well a must visit when going to China Town.
I really enjoyed my visit here and went away feeling empowered.
You must remove your shoes and have appropriate clothing on and be very quite as is respectful."
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"We stayed in Chinatown during Chinese new year and the temple was lit up with lanterns. It was a beautiful sight at night, with the entire temple cast in an orange glow."
,,Well worth a look when in Chinatown,4.0,,"The temple has always been a centre-point of my travel to Singapore. Not at all religious however I simply love the serene atmosphere this temple has to offer.

I don't know if it is the character of my little one however she was very quiet during their ceremonies that the monks even noticed and gave her a special blessing which was a surprise to us."
,,"A Nice Temple , quite and peace",4.0,,"A Temple , that you may visit, if you are going to Singapore and , must if you are going to near by of China town. A quite large , very peaceful and holy environments."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Do not just go through the temple go to all the levels upstairs all the way up to the roof and see the history of Buddha.
,,Spectacular!,4.0,,"Had a wonderful wander around this temple. Very lavish, but if you read the information provided adjacent to each statue, it is fascinating. Even though it was busy, I found the temple to be peaceful, and a photographers paradise!
Unfortunately I didn't realise you go go to the other floors, so missed them!
There are sarongs at the entrance to cover bare legs or arms."
,,Very interesting and amazing temple,4.0,,Was there on a sunday morning and walked around the beautyfull museum. 4 floors to walk around amazing collection
,,Amazing Place!,5.0,,"Many locals suggested we visit this temple whilst in Singapore's Chinatown area. Admission is free although a donation is welcome and it lets you light an incense stick for whatever you might like to wish; health, happiness love etc. While we were there, they had a mighty ceremony happening and it was spell binding. A smaller ceremony was happening at the first altar too. You could easily spend an hour or so reading about the history of the place and the Buddhist beliefs."
,,Beautiful Buddhist Temple,4.0,,The statues were beautifully set up. Colourful and bright. They allow you to take selfies and photos and do not have the usual smoky atmosphere seen in some other venues.
,,a really great temple... to walk past,2.0,,"It really is quite beautiful to look at from the outside, and its right next to Chinatown. Nothing much to see if you've been to any other temples in Asia... walk past it on your way around Chinatown."
,,Like being back in China,3.0,,Whilst walking around Chinatown we decided to visit the temple even though it says no shorts they let me in after removing my hat! But my wife was made to cover her arms with a shawl that they provide. well worth a visit and very colourful inside but some parts you are not permitted to photograph.
,,fleeting visit,3.0,,I have been to many Buddhist temples so this was nice to visit but perhaps I just added to the crowd of tourists. Could have skipped it.
,,Good for an experience,4.0,,Well...if you want to experience a Buddhist temple then this should be the place. Lots of local shopping around the area as well.
,,Very interesting,4.0,,Even if you are not a Buddist this is worth visiting as the immaculate presentation is good on the eye.
,,Grand Temple Worth Visiting,4.0,,"This is a large temple with about 4 floors if memory serves correctly. The ground floor being the actual temple which is worth popping your head in if your in a rush. The other floors are more like a museum to Buddhism one floor for artifacts and another detailing Buddhisms history, which I found most informative."
,,Not for everyone,3.0,,"This temple mainly boasts the sacred buddha on the 4th floor which is made of gold. This level also allows people a tranquil space for meditation and reflection, with the 'three refuges' chant playing in the background. Not really for me :)

If you are not religious, or have no interest in learning more about Buddhism, give this place a miss. And if you do decide to go, be reminded to be dressed in well-covered top and bottoms! Respect the religion :)"
,,Understands Buddhism a lot more,4.0,,"The architecture is grand but yet somehow managed to appear humble. Perhaps its because it does not have the usual garish adornments of a typical Taoist temple.
I didn't quite like the main prayer hall as it seems overly ostentatious with all the gold trimmings and stuff. But look deeper in the details and visit the the hidden areas.
The building has several levels. I can only say that that each level is a 'must-see'.
Start from the roof level and work your way down. The room has a Bell Tower set in lush landscaping and ponds.
My favourite is the musuem on level 4 where I spent the most time and yet leaving with the awareness of how little I understand Buddhism.
Of course, the 'star' attraction is the Buddha tooth relic which was housed in a overly decorated sealed room. It was really nothing much to look at. But I spoke with a friendly monk who happened to be there and his narration about the relic was just fascinating. Guess it helps that he was chatty and that I understand Chinese.
Don't rush through your visit. Give yourself at least 2 hours. It's worth your time if such attractions interest you. Otherwise just allow 30 minutes to just have a quick walk-through and go to the nearby food centre for some nice Singapore food."
,,Visit elsewhere please,2.0,,I have no idea what are they showcasing and there is nothing to see other than devotees and some wall display.
,,Colourful .... And free!,4.0,,"Whether or not you have leanings toward Buddhism this is a worthwhile trip...lots to see ... Colourful, interesting and close to other attractions. Top tip ... Take the lift/elevator to the top floor and work your way down... No shorts or sleepless tops ...."
,,"Stunning Temple, Fantastic Experience",5.0,,"The temple was beautiful, it was free of charge and is situated right near Chinatown close to some great stalls/shopping. It was a lot larger than I expected with many levels full of statues and relics. The museum sections were very informative with lots of information about the different relics. I enjoyed this very much, it was a very peaceful/rejuvenating experience. I highly recommend."
,,"Well Kept Up, and some Seminars",4.0,,"Had the good fortune to come during a speech that one of the monks was giving on the importance of family, with candles lit up everywhere, lights shining bright, and the artifacts on full display. From my understanding, having speakers is not a rare occurrence, so if you're around Chinatown, just stop in for a little and take a look. You might be surprised."
,,Worth a visit whatever your religion,5.0,,"Excellent traditional style Chinese Temple, looks old but was completed a few years ago, it's built in the older part of Chinatown at the end of Sago Lane, this area was where the old coffin makers and death houses were before the modernisation of Singapore.
We visited the Temple with a volunteer guide, she explained many details that would be missed without a guide, the Temple is definitely worth a visit and if you are able to arrange a tour with a Temple guide the visit will be so much better, the Museum on one of the upper floors is interesting and informative, and the colourful and spectacular ceremonies are an impressive sight, you don't have to be a Buddhist to appreciate the temple, regardless of personal beliefs or religion the Temple and it's daily religious routines was well worth the visit."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Amazing cultural experience, and for free! How amazing. Really enjoyed seeing this temple. There is lots to see in the surrounding area as well. Go at 900am and see the chanting. There is a schedule on their website."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Absolutely a must see in Singapore! The building itself was beautiful, and the museum on the 3rd floor was well presented and informative. There was a rooftop garden, that unfortunately does not have a view of Singapore, but was still quite pretty. Most certainly worth an hour or so of your time!"
,,"Wow, this was amazing!",5.0,,"I have been to many Buddhist temples around various places in Asia and a ""tooth relic"" temple and museum title sounded like it might be a small and unremarkable place. But I found this temple and museum was very impressive indeed, a working temple but so much to see and take in. It is one of the most impressive Buddhist structures I've ever been to, and I do recommend checking it out."
,,"Beautiful temple, nice ceremony",4.0,,"The outside doesn't resemble the beauty of the inside of the temple. There was a ceremony going on with Budhists 'singing' / reading. We didn't really know what they were doing, but it was a good experience. There's a nice shiny golden statue inside. For the record: you don't get to see a tooth. ;-)"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Much bigger than I expected it to be and we were lucky to be there when ceremony was taking place. Show respect and sovereign your arms and legs when you visit this very peaceful and welcoming place. Right next to China town so a good area to spend a couple of hours.
,,Next to China Town,3.0,,Big and beautiful temple. You have to cover up your shoulders and legs if you wish to enter the temple. They have a museum upstairs where they have the Buddha Relics. After that you can just walk next door to enjoy China Town.
,,The inside is more interesting than the outside,5.0,,"The temple is based on the Tang dynasty architectural style and built to house the tooth relic of the historical Buddha. The ground breaking ceremony was conducted on 13 March 2005. Costing S$62 million and 2 years later, a soft launch was held to coincide with the 2007 Vesak Day celebration. It is claimed that the relic of Buddha from which it gains its name was found in 1980 in a collapsed stupa in Myanmar. It was very interesting to visit this place of worship during an active service,"
,,Lots more than expected!,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful, donation entry, but worth every penny, we were there during the Buddhist chanting really awesome, dont miss this temple, more impressive than most others."
,,The place to go,5.0,,"Try to very a good Buddhist ,,,it will help in. Many ways with your life ,,,buy books here snd prayer bead. Very good and only a few dollars ,,,"
,,It's a fake!,1.0,,"Such a shame that the ""relic"" is fake yet they sell the attraction like the real stuff. Have they not heard of ""no fakes"" or ""originals only""?"
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,I guess it has 3 or 4 floors and extremely well maintained. Tranquil atmosphere and at once place you can even meditate and feel the silence around you amidst the buddhist chants. The Museum is very impressive and inspires you by highlighting all the aspects of the life of Buddha. A must go if you are near China Town.
,,Huge,4.0,,This place is much more extensive then I expected. Do check it out if you are in Chinatown as its well worth it.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,First time that I got inside a Buddhist Temple. The relics and design are beautiful and very fascinating. Those wearing shorts and sleeveless shirts need to wear sarongs which I understand is for respect.
,,A palace of peace.,4.0,,This temple is situated at the Chinatiwn Street. It looks massive from the outside. There are taxi and car parking station available. Plenty of street food shops to eat and shop around from he souvenir and gift shops circling the temple. Inside there is nice enchanting environment which gives you a spiritual feeling. Best time to visit is early unthe morning and evening.
,,China Town,5.0,,This beautiful Temple is worth visiting. It has 3 floor and a Beautiful roof garden. They also have a small museum very well put.
,,Simply breathtaking,5.0,,This temple is stunning. Laced with gold and red decoration all around and each wall filled with numbered statues of the deities. There were thousands of the statues and we visited during a reading which was very interesting. The smell of incense sticks add to the fabulous atmosphere. All free to visit and take pictures too.
,,Nice buddhist temple,5.0,,A new Buddhist temple but very well done. I enjoyed the free tour on Saturday at lunch time. Museum upstairs is also very interesting
,,Stunning,4.0,,"We only had a few minutes to look in this temple before being whisked off to the night zoo. The gilded dragons and statues were amazing. My wife was unable to enter the main temple room because her shoulders were uncovered. As this was a bonus on another trip that we had not expected to do, this was not a problem. They did have shoulder covers that you could borrow - but we did not have enough time. Recommended."
,,A little bit of peace in a bustling city,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a haven of tranquility amid the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. There is so much to take in, that you need to walk through it more than once to do it justice. If you're lucky, your visit may coincide with the monks chanting - I've experienced it, it's so moving and calming at the same time. There is an option to buy a candle or flowers, to make an offering for a loved one - no matter what your religion, it's a very special thing to do. There is a beautiful tranquil garden a few floors up which is well worth a visit, as well as the little gift shop on the ground floor. You are allowed to take photos in the temple - to me it somehow feels wrong though, as people are praying, but as long as you're respectful I'm sure it's ok. If you're concerned about what you're wearing, there are sarongs and scarves to cover up excess skin so as not to offend, it's also worth noting that Chinatown has free wifi."
,,Wonderful atmosphere,5.0,,"Another must do in Singapore. Soak up the atmosphere of total peace and calm, enjoy walking in the roof garden and observe those spinning the prayer wheel; a lovely place to visit."
,,Hidden marvel,5.0,,"This was a haven of tranquility in the heart of Chinatown. A huge, imposing edifice housing the hall of 100 Buddhas and a wonderfully serene place to stop and think."
,,Peaceful place in a central city,4.0,,"It's wonderful place with a quite environment. U will be like it, it seem like a heaven. Very peaceful place which I ever seen."
,,Interesting and peaceful in busy Chinatown,4.0,,"Curious about the Buddha Tooth relic we entered not expecting too much. What a great surprise. The Buddha Tooth room was fabulous and there was interesting information provided everywhere. The museum on the third floor was also great, but don't miss the top floor which is a delightful oasis in busy Chinatown. Enoy the orchids and in Prayet Drum and a little quiet reflection and a rest in a wonder place."
,,Thrilling experience,5.0,,"This is a place worth visiting!
With my husband we had goose-bumps all the time while we were inside the building. Upstairs there is a wonderful garden, and there is also a museum about Buddha's and his follower's life. The place has an amazing atmosphere and we were spiritually refilled by the time we left."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This Temple and Museum was stunning. A very busy place. The architecture of the building was amazing. Many locals visited this place and hung out outside in the grounds playing board games or enjoying a chit chat with mates. Incense is burning all the time and this does affect my eyes and allergies but otherwise it was well worth the visit
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"In Chinatown, this temple and museum is certainly beautiful and important. I must admit that even knowing we were going to a temple did not trigger that we needed to cover our shoulders and wear something to the knee. Three of our group were gently asked to wear shawls and 'skirts' which were provided free of charge. I would have preferred to have remembered to been respectful - so I hope this helps others!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This is a must visit. This is just besides the Singapore's oldest mosque and Hindu temple. All three can be covered on the same day.
In the temple, dont forget to fourth floor for the tooth relic viewing. It is open till 6 pm. If you have some more time, meditate. On third floor, the museum is very good source to learn about the life of Buddha."
,,"A must see, don't miss the upper floors!",5.0,,"Beautiful inside though how the locals meditate with all the tourists walking past I don't know. Get there early to avoid this. Upstairs is a stunning air conditioned room where the Buddha tooth relic is kept ( no photos). Also on another floor are other interesting relics of parts of the Buddhas body .. Teeth, intestines , tongue etc... Fascinating to visit!"
,,Inspiring visit,4.0,,Very inspiring visit. Very nice to find the Buddha that matches the Chinese (Lunar) year that you are born in.
,,peace and tranquility in Singapore,4.0,,"Buddha tooth relic temple is an abode of peace, tranquility and a feeling of submissiveness to the Almighty!You feel totally detached from the materialistic world as soon as you enter this temple An isolated piece of tranquility in the hustle buslte of busy Chinatown When we went in the morning, a special religious rite was being performed with a good number of Buddhist nuns in ceremonial robes along with other Buddhist priests Since the whole temple is air conditioned, no incense stick is allowed inside Near the the back entrance, there is a clean and free toilet Outside the back gate, there are shops selling good coffee and sweet breads for S$1each Buddha tooth relic is kept in the 4th floor which however is not open when we went There is also a good roof top garden If you pay a visit to this sacred place and find my observations of any help to you,please give me a helpful vote to acknowledge that my review is of any help to a fellow travller and chant' BUDDHANG SHARANAG GACCHAMI'
PS :Some dress code prevails here-you must cover your bare arms or lower legs for which they will provide covering shawls free of cost kept in big baskets which you can pick yourself"
,,Different Perspective,3.0,,A slightly different look at belief. It was a busy period when I visited and I felt I had walked into a commercial enterprise. Well maintained
,,Roof to garden,5.0,,"A must see place not many people go up there very serene and beautiful. When we visited there were prayers said in the main hall, a nice cultural experience."
,,Tranquility in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Nestled in the hustle and bustle of Chinatown, the temple is a must visit. The relic room is amazing, and getting blessed by the monk was a surreal experience. The donation of $10 was more than worth it.

Also visit the rooftop garden - many people miss it since the elevator doesn't go there but it's a beautiful place."
,,Must go,5.0,,"The place is very impressive and makes anyone want to know more about the Buddhist culture. In the upper levels you can find a cool museum telling a lot about this culture, and it's worth spending a few hours. In the last level there's a very beautiful chamber with the tooth relic (unfortunately they don't allow to take any pics of the chamber)."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Although there is not much paper information the people inside are happy to tell you what you want/need to know. On the 4th floor is the tooth relic,you can also sit in contemplation there,as many do,its very peaceful. The roof top garden is even more peaceful with a tropical garden & water features. My 10 year old daughter loved coming here & was fascinated by the chanting monks, sat in meditation & was interested in the buddhist religion. Its so colourful,relaxing & beautiful. Take the kids here for definite !"
,,Stunning Temple,5.0,,Well worth the trip. Its in the centre of China town so you can combine it with a day of stall hopping. The temple itself is wonderful and a great place to relax and chill from the noise of the city. Go after lunch and let your food digest in peace
,,impressive,4.0,,Love all the Buddha's. People looking after the temple and visitors were very polite and helpful. Plenty of shawls to cover us terrible tourists who where sleeveless tops
,,Meditation,4.0,,enjoy the atmosphere learn abt ur zodiac/astrology meditate n relax quiet big and once u are done u can go to china town or Maxwell food court for famous tian tian chicken rice.
,,Bright & busy,4.0,,Worth a short visit although don't make a long journey. The temple is bright with plenty going on. If you are wearing shorts they will provide a wrap to cover your knees prior to entry. Interesting to see but perhaps a guide in English would have given more info
,,Pleasant temple,5.0,,"The temple had many offerings for the first 3 days if chinese month and was fascinating to see varioud food delicacies as offerings. The 100 Buddhas inside and the prayer room were beautifully decorated with golden and red color miniatures. The ceilings were painted depicting chinese art and the dragon sculptures were stunning to look at.
P.S - Dress code is followed here."
,,wonderful temple,4.0,,"Is a first time that i see that chinese temple have air con inside usually is hot. free to go in with no charges. Quite peaceful when i go inside. Level 4 was the teeth relic but is close inside usually it open during vesk day.

Like here the most because it have the clear in my mind to distress myself."
,,A good place to visit if you're in China Town,4.0,,"The temple is very well decorated and maintained. The museum upstairs has a small exhibition of Buddhism, which is worth to spend some time. But don't stop there. Go to the roof where there is a big prayer wheel and a tranquil, small garden.

Also, try the vegetarian cafeteria in the basement. There is no price set for the self-service buffet; you pay as you wish (just drop the money in the box)."
,,Visually stunning,5.0,,"I love visiting temples because they're often an explosion of colors, yet inspire serenity and reflection. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple does just that - it simultaneously stimulates the visual senses and calms the spirit, especially if you venture up to the rooftop garden. While visiting Chinatown, it's well worth spending 30 -40 minutes taking it all in before heading to the Maxwell Road hawker center to stimulate your taste buds."
,,Surreal experience,4.0,,"We stumbled across this place by accident, but what luck. To experience people involved in worship and the incredible beauty of the relics was an experience I'll never forget!"
,,Peaceful and serene,4.0,,"Visited the place in the afternoon. A lovely place to visit though one can not see the tooth as such. The elephant that carried the tooth relic is now itself a relic and is venerated. The museums and the walk through the temple is invigorating. The lotus flowers outside the temple which can be bought for offering are lovely and fresh.Be reminded that there are restrictions about wearing dress that should not be above the knee.

Even the drive from Hunaa falls to reach this on the way to the airport is itself very good."
,,Amazing Get away in heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Its free!! but they encourage donations and you should do so as the museum and artifacts are worthy of the admission only

If you timing is right then you can experience prayer service and its not to be missed

and the 4 upper floors contain a garden at the top - dont expect city views but another temple - Temple of the 1000 Budda's - and then 3 floor explaining the progress of Buddism and amazing artifacts throughout

Well worth a hour or two of calming and peaceful time away from the bustle of Singapore"
,,Great visit,5.0,,This was a lovely place to visit. The people in the gift shop were very helpful and explained how the church worked.
,,Stunning experience and amazing atmosphere,5.0,,"I arrived during afternoon prayer services and it was quite something to see and experience. The building itself is beautiful, the4 staff helpful and the museum was very informative and well presented. A non- Buddist like myself found it very interesting and welcoming. Please be aware of cultural/religious customs- no shoes, bare body parts(shoulders, legs, etc) and the areas that allow photographs versus the ones that don;t. There is clear signage so it should not be a big problem......save yourself an awkward moment and dress accordingly if this is a destination for you."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"welcoming and peaceful, a calming space away from the hustle of China town. A must visit for all Buddhists and non religious persons but make sure you show respect in your dress standards, no singlets or short shorts or inappropriate slogans on clothing."
,,Such a very very very symbolic temple,5.0,,"This place caught me off-guard. I mean, i am a Buddhist myself, and i visited many temples in my life. We have a common phrase here, called as ""Chinese temples"" to indicate temples looked....Chinese. But this one, situated at the very Chinatown, it's....it's very....original. i don't know how to explain, but i was in awe when I visited here, and i was so glad that i decided to visit Chinatown that day and set foot in this temple. the interior, the monks, the temple itself, it's very...religious and offered such a peaceful feeling for me. I love this place a lot, and i want to visit this place again soon"
,,Calming experience.,5.0,,"Awesome experience. There's a free meditation space on the 2nd or 4th floor of this place, where the tooth relic is placed as well and it can only be accessible by elevator. I spent almost 2 hours just meditating here. Very calming experience.

If you visit during the weekends, you can even check out the extra-curricular activities right outside of the mall next to it. Older folks dancing in a group, etc. I recorded a short video of it which can be viewed at http://youtu.be/SaiySGSbgfY"
,,eye catching pagoda,3.0,,it's a striking pagoda and you are made welcome when you enter. as an attraction it's interesting and keeps you interested for a short while but it's not a morning or afternoon out on it's own. very photogenic building.
,,Peace!,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to visit this temple whilst a service was in 'action', but the highlight for me was going upstairs, and then onto the roof garden. Peace among the busyness of Singapore. Don't miss the pray wheel!"
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,This was my first time there. As a Buddhist I admire this place. It's interior very colourful . This is one of few Buddhist temples in Asia allowed to take photographs. I like this place & it was crowded too. It's a nice place to be..
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Visited the Temple which is absolutely beautiful. Wandering around looking at the amazing statues while the monks were chanting was a lovely and calming experience. We also had a nice (vegetarian) lunch while there.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,In the middle of a very busy road beautiful calming a joy to go inside I am not a Buddhist but love to visit their temples always feel more relaxed when I leave
,,Beautiful calming place,5.0,,Such a nice place to visit so beautiful and calming. Went and visited while the monks were praying such a spiritual place to visit.
,,Welcoming,5.0,,"We are not Buddhist but the temple was lovely and we were made to feel very welcome I had to cover my shoulders and some women had to cover their legs but they have shawls and sarongs there for this purpose, we had a lovely man tell us where we are allowed to go and what to go and see, lucky for us we arrived just on time for when the monks and local Buddhists started to chant and worship. Was educational and enjoyable experience."
,,Really pretty temple,4.0,,Lovely peaceful temple in the middle of a busy city. Absolutely amazing to see all the Buddha statues so many of them and great detail.
,,Gold and peaceful,4.0,,"in this temple you will find the typical peace of any buddhist temple, plus hundreds of golden and red statue and painting. It is spectacular for your eyes! Don't miss it!
It is in the heart of chinatown and it can give you a nice little break from the messy streets of the market.
http://nomadswind.com/chinatown-is-always-the-best/"
,,Amazing Lots of Buddhas,4.0,,I learned something about Buddhism during my visit to this place in Chinatown. I also love their upper floor of a little garden where I was able to turn 8 times their wheel. A must visit and learn some values and cultures about Buddha.
,,A beautiful pagoda,4.0,,"Cannot be missed if you are in Chinatown,free admission. Though looks ok ok from outside,its stunning inside in all its golden hues."
,,Interesting,3.0,,I was taken here by some friends. It was an interesting experience I have to say. The inside is marvellous and very colourful. The golds and reds are stunning but it was a shed overdone for my taste. Worth a visit though even if you are not a Buddhist to see what other cultures and traditions have to offer.
,,Clean restrooms... an important consideration!,5.0,,"OK, it is far more than clean restrooms. In fact, it is a beautiful temple celebrating the relics of Buddha. While we were there, a Buddhist monk was there offering to bless anyone who wished it. It was customary to provide an offering, which we gladly provided.

Don't miss the fourth floor outdoor gardens. It is easy to miss this serene getaway after the amazing visit to the third floor reliquary, covered top to bottom with gold."
,,Knowledge & Serenity,4.0,,"A visit here is a break from the busy streets of Singapore. We were lucky enough to arrive as the monks were chanting. What a difference this made to the visit. The temple is very ornately decorated and interesting to see.Garments are provided for the less modestly dressed, sarongs and shawls. We toured around on our own, so may have missed some of the more significant information, but really it has signs and information all round. Many people were meditating in the room with the ""Tooth"". The prayer wheel on the roof top and the surrounding garden were very peaceful. The whole experience left us feeling tranquil and relaxed."
,,Have to learn more detail,5.0,,The review is a bit from an older time but the basics are the same.Just have a preview of how Buddhism is and how it flourishes.There are lifts upto sixth floor and then you need to walk through a gallery.In the main hall you might not be allowed to take photos.So you could get postcards of the main hall for a price.There is a big prayer garden upstairs.All needs more time to digest.There is great incense aroma.A place to see again if you have lots time.Also before you do any visit to Buddha kingdoms just see this place first.There is a restaurant below.
,,peacefulness in heart of chinatown,5.0,,Very nice. They have saris and shawls to lend if you have bare legs or shoulders. Front part ornate. Free books on Buddhism if you want to increase your knowledge.
,,Serene,3.0,,"A rather opulently decorated temple at the ground floor is beautiful. What really stands out is the spiritual atmosphere of the hall where the tooth relic is housed...the chanting transfers one to a different realm altogether. The prayer wheel on the terrace and the peaceful atmosphere invite one to just sit down and spend some quiet moments with yourself. A lady at the ground floor temple asked me to donate SGD 10 and I did, but this somewhat put me off a bit, as I felt all donations should be voluntary,"
,,very interesting temple but hard to find on foot until you realsie it is right by the tourist bus terminal,4.0,,there are hundreds of buddah statues here .It is well worth going up the levels to view the prayer wheel
,,Amazing,5.0,,Beautiful temple with so much to see. Definitely could have spent much longer looking in the museum and bookshop
,,My favorite attraction,5.0,,"A wonderful place to visit. It is very ornate, the backdrops are beautifully embroidered and the craftsmanship throughout is exquisite. Cameras are allowed and there is a gift shop at one end. Please plan ahead if you want to actually see the tooth. Free tours are bookable to view the upper floor where I am assuming the tooth is, it may only be brought out on special occasions though. Even without seeing the tooth, the architecture is spectacular. I loved it."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"Calm and serene. You are allowed inside the temple and can watch the ceremonies at close quarters. After you see the ground floor, you can take the elevator to the 4th floor, and then work you way downwards. The garden on the 5th floor is accessible only by stairs from the fourth floor."
,,Beautiful and Culturally Rich,5.0,,"The Temple is really beautiful and culturally very rich. With the help of my tour guide I expanded my knowledge about Chinese culture and Buddhism. Do not miss out on this beautiful place.

For a little more of my experience, here is the link to my blog:

,,Lovely temple,5.0,,Offer your prayers... See the artistic work. Roam around in small market. Recommended place to visit.
,,havign a look at a touristic temple,4.0,,"If you are in singapore and you want to take a look to the Buddha Temple be aware that it seems it has been built for tourists.
On the other side it's located in one of the best spot in singapore. It's very close to china town and to other different temple."
,,A good insight into Buddhism,4.0,,"I spent an hour here on a very hot afternoon. The roof garden with the large revolving bell is worth going up stairs to see. There is a large collection of statues and articles of religious significance on the second floor.
The collection of little Buddha figures lining the walls is very impressive."
,,Cultural powerhouse,4.0,,"This is by far the most interesting and engaging temple in Singapore. Built with many floors, it incorporates a huge temple with a museum that houses some wonderful Buddhist imagery from all over Asia.

The main temple has an awe inspiring atmosphere and is filled with amazing colourful statues. The 4th floor has the Buddha Tooth Relic and is a spiritual haven that is utterly conducive to meditation and reflection. The roof garden is a tranquil spot as well and you can turn the Vairochana prayer wheel in its central shrine. The museum floors have some stunning pieces and if you want a quick education in the differences between the iconography of various Buddhist countries, then this is the place.

I highly recommend this place as it has something for everyone and is very well cared for."
,,"NIce Temple, and very interesting Museum",3.0,,This temple have a good architecture. It nice to visit here for getting a knowledge about the Buddhist rituals.
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,This beautiful Chinese Buddhist temple houses one of the Buddha's teeth along with other interesting relics. I was there during a service and found the whole thing fascinating.
,,Very much of praying,5.0,,"Located at chinatown, free of charge and the atmosphere is so nice that I have to come back 2 time for this. Just to enjoy myself, praying for goodness may come to the one that I love...
There are thousands of Buddha in many posture here, great and detail investment make it a very nice and cozy place."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Not knowing anything about Buddhism we were quite surprised on entering. Gloriously decorated and colourful with monks chanting in the centre and tourists milling around outside. The tooth relic is on an upper floor safely secured behind bullet proof glass but in a wonderful meditative room. We were with a guide from Indie Singapore Tours so we got maximum information and value from this space. A visit is recommended.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This working Temple in the heart of China town will often have a ceremony of some description going on for the benefit of the worship per sit services - fascinating to watch. In addition, on the upper floors, there is a museum explaining Buddhism and a peaceful roof garden. Pop in and don't be surprised if you end up spending longer than you had planned."
,,Always something going on,5.0,,"I visited this temple about five times and almost every time there is some celebration going on. It is a large temple, with various rooms and multiple levels. It is always an interesting and pretty place to visit."
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"As a buddhist member, i did my daily practice in this temple and got blessed from Buddha. It was a must- to-see attraction of Singapore"
,,I peaceful getaway,5.0,,"No better way to begin a morning than a peacful, spiritual encounter. This temple is a very nice place to indulge in Buddhism, or simply admire the thousand Buddha statues and the Buddha tooth. Don't forget to take the elevator to the top floor to see the orchid garden! It is also conveniently located across from Maxwell Food Centre, where you can grab a cheap, yet delicious meal!"
,,Retreat in Chinatown,4.0,,"In the past, this has seemed more like a monument than a temple, in that there was barely any apparent religious activity (unlike, for instance, at the popular Guanyin Temple on Waterloo Street). More recently, however, one is likely to come across monks chanting prayers and/or reciting sutras, which creates a lovely, peaceful atmosphere. The upper floors are worth perusing. Not to be missed is the orchid garden and gigantic Tibetan prayer wheel on the top floor. A good place to escape from the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. You have to look for the elevator on the street side, take it to the 4th floor and walk up another story. Be aware that those deemed to be unsuitably dressed will be asked to don robes that are freely provided for the purpose."
,,"The most beautiful temple I've ever seen, must visit!",5.0,,"The temple is located in China Town, in ca. 10 minutes walk from China Town MRT station. It is unfortunately forbidden to take photoes in some parts of the temple, but in general you can make them, but without flash. The temple looks like golden inside, thousands of Buddhas surround you. You can use elevator to get up on the other floors. Different exhibitions are located there, everything is for free. We spent around 40 minutes in the temple as it is rather big. It wsas definitely the most beatiful temple I have ever seen in my life."
,,Worth the Experience,4.0,,"Definitely worth the visit for all family types. English explanations, quiet and serene. A nice experience out of the harsh Singapore heat."
,,Buddah tooth relic temple,5.0,,Great example of a functioning temple with space for tourists to look through also. I enjoyed the space and history and found it contained meditative spaces too on the different floor levels. Books at entry were much appreciated and read frequently.
,,Religious,5.0,,A wonderful monument and a beautiful place to visit and linger and one of those must see and do would highly recommend it is an education of a different culture y
,,Peaceful and Devine,5.0,,Being there is Just so peaceful. Feels Devine. Excellent architecture. It's one of my memorable place I visited in Singapore
,,Must See in Chinatown,5.0,,We visit every time whilst in Singapore as the venue whilst of a religious significance is a stand out attraction for quality and interest. It is close to Pagoda Street and hardly an effort to get there on route to other sights. The Buddhist Temple houses a tooth said to be from Buddah and whilst significant it is the structure and size of the venue that astounds. If I am correct the Temple has cost some $40M so I can suggest that it is worth visiting.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,So beautiful. The brightness of the gold is unbelievable. You get a sense of peace when you visit . Light some incense and say a prayer(or good thought ) for loved ones no matter what your religion/belief.
,,One of the Most Beautiful Buddhist Temples in Asia,4.0,,"Both the Temple and Buddhist Museum offer a wonderful experience for visitors. It is highly recommended that you go to all of the floors on the upper levels to experience all that the Temple has to offer. The Museum has an exceptional collection of Buddhist history from around the world, and for those not familiar with Buddhism, is a wonderful learning experience. All of the displays are certain to awe the visitor with wonderful sights, smells, and sounds."
,,Temple,5.0,,Awesome experience. Incredible architecture. A must see in Singapore. Easy to visit this Temple and China Town in one day.
,,Very cool experience in Chinatown,5.0,,"We were not actually seaking this out, but stumbled upon it after a stroll through the Chinatown shops. Directly opposite the hawker Center, this is an active temple with recent origins but very accomodating to visitors. Be prepared for many active worshipers, on the day we stopped in they were ""chanting"", non-stop, from 10-6. This was actually very cool, led by the monks but the worshipers were welcome to grab a seat and chant along using the books provided. Sort of like a hymnal, I have no idea what the chant was about, wish I had more time to get educated. Simply put, this is a beautiful temple, museum, and attraction - don't wait to stumble upon it, seek it out and I promise you will enjoy the experience."
,,Typical Buddhist temple,4.0,,"It's a Buddhist temple. If you've never seen one, you must go. It's the nicest one in Singapore. If you've been to China and already seen your fair share, you won't miss anything if you skip it. It is an active temple, not just a tourist attraction, so you will see people praying."
,,Interesting,3.0,,I wasn't allowed in due to dress code but was able to wander the foyer and outside. Very colourful and in the historic Chinatown precinct with many shops and restaurants nearby
,,Peacefull place,3.0,,"Located right next to Chinatown Food Street (Smith Street), this temple is quite easy to find. Free of charge, you can freely enter this temple and its museum, and take some photos inside (yet there are some place that is prohibited to take picture). You are allowed to visit 1-5th floor. There are museum on the 3rd and 4th floor, and roof garden at 5th floor."
,,"For the architecture & surrounding, but not the tooth.",2.0,,"While I would not want to comment too much about the tooth relic, I do appreciate the architecture of the temple (which was built in recent times (10-15 years?) with the museum in mind first and not as a temple first.

Do check out the surrounding places, especially the hawker centre .... the new one by the street or the older one on the 2nd/3rd floor of the building behind. As a local, I’ll go for the latter anytime."
,,Beautiful Buddhist Temple & Museum,4.0,,"nice building w grand buddha, lots buddha, w history & lots of Buddha relics, statues and the valuable Buddha Tooth. the place that i always visit during vesak day n performed the bathing the buddha ceremony yearly."
,,Multi level extremely interesting,4.0,,Its very hard to see the actual relic but wow this temple is amazing all the gold and buddhas take your time through this place to enjoy take it all in.
,,Beautiful Buddhist Temple in China Town,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a Buddhist temple located in the Chinatown. It is a peaceful and silent place. I was amazed by the architectural style it was so beautiful and historical . it was a memorable experience in my life .
,,Great great history and culture,5.0,,"This is the temple that can drop your jaw. So beautiful, so historical, and peaceful. First floor is the place where people pray and you also can see lots of beautiful statues. You go to second, third, fourth, and the roof is also beautiful. They have lots of Buddha relics, statues from all over the world, and also people meditating. On the roof there were orchid garden with beautiful flowers."
,,Beautiful temple that welcomes visitors,5.0,,"I was amazed and impressed at the beauty of the relics and statues. The temple is open to visitors on all floors. Don't be shy and just walk on the first floor, take the stairs and see it all. I do feel sorry for those who are there to meditate and worship as there are more visitors than meditators. There is a good exhibit on the origin of Buddhism. I found this to be an inspirational experience."
,,A bit of tranquility in the middle of busy Chinatown,4.0,,Lovely temple with prominently Chinese architectural style. The inside is clean and quiet. Very peaceful despite the tourists visiting the temple. I enjoyed walking around inside and admiring the various artefacts inside.
,,Relics,4.0,,Full of statues and relics depicting Buddha's life..has different interesting things on display on different storeys
,,Tooth Relic,4.0,,Loved the architecture of this temple...this takes up considerable space with numerous storeys accessible through a lift and different fascinating things to see at each level. Must see!!
,,interesting,4.0,,I liked that the doors of this temple are open to all visitors and that we were allowed to wander through.
,,So interesting,5.0,,"A beautiful temple. We were fortunate to 'bump' into an English speaking Singaporean, a temple volunteer, who took us around the temple and explained the different aspects of Buddhism. It was pretty amazing and the golden Buddha's were stunning. Don't forget to turn the prayer wheel 3 times! Watch out for hawkers at the Chinese market nearby............"
,,An interesting and colourful temple,4.0,,"Chance about this temple when we were walking along Chinatown. Great for photos (as not all temples allow photography) with very beautiful tapestry and deity statues inside.

Its free entry and I would recommend if you are in the Chinatown area to pop in for photos or to pray for blessings. :)"
,,Sacred temple and importantly covered up dress code,3.0,,"Situated in Chinatown, one will not missed this sacred temple though it is not superly big. Many levels of the temple to explore but they are very particular about dresscode. No singlet or tank top or skirts/shorts especially for ladies. Good thing they provide shawl for cover-up for those who does not know like myself. Very beautiful temple to visit."
,,a beautiful temple,5.0,,"the temple is located in Chinatown.
one is allowed only in neat clothing since it's a holy place.
at the entrance, you can change 10 SG$ into 100*10 cents - for every Buddha image there is a place for donation.
worth a visit since it's v-e-r-y impressive & beautiful inside."
,,A holy place,5.0,,"I think it is a good place to go, if you are a Buddhism. It was a beautiful temple although it is not big but it's wonderful."
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,5.0,,I recommend you take your time and explore all levels of the temple. For us the unexpected highlight was meeting people on the roof garden who told us about the prayer wheel and asked us to join in turning the wheel with them while chanting 'Om Padme Um'.
,,A Peaceful Place,4.0,,"No matter what your faith or religion, this place is serene and peaceful - & a sight to behold.
A walk-through takes only 5 minutes, but take-twenty and soak in the history.
Refurbished and renovated 8 years ago in 2552 (Buddha) or 2008 A.D. and well worth a visit on a stroll thru' Chinatown.
No entrance fee - only a charitable donation."
,,A special place,5.0,,"This is a truly special place. You can see part of China, even though you are in Singapore. The gold that covers all the statues and walls its overwhelming. The atmosphere its so peaceful in spite of all the tourists. A must see if you are close to china town."
,,Include in your itinerary,4.0,,"Situated in the heart of China Town, the temple is quite amazing and peaceful. It is beautiful inside with thousands of images (~10,000) of Buddha in different avatars/ poses. Its quite a sight to see much of gold in one place but with the humming of chants in the background, its gives you more peace and contentment than a materialistic vibe. It is very near to China town where you can get cheap stuff but quality can be an issue. There isn't a lot to do in China town otherwise. So this temple is a pleasant add-on to your China Town to do list."
,,You have to come here,5.0,,"Firstly, let me confess that Temple's are not my thing, but my partner loves them and this is a very impressive Temple situated in the heart of China Town. We did not go up to the roof top garden, but that did not detract from our visit.

Please be respectful when visiting, as this is a working Temple, taking photographs and being noisy is crass behaviour."
,,Worth Doing,5.0,,"It's new and built around a questionable canine, but atmosphere is still impressive. Chanting on ground floor is hypnotic and colorful, museum is excellent quality and nicely done, rooftop garden and giant prayer wheel are impressive and the tooth itself sits in golden splendor. Didn't think it would be much, but it's worth an hour in Singapore."
,,You can feel the peace.,4.0,,"The temple looks amazing and is just so spiritual and peaceful. The roof top gardens are very pretty and the internal features stunning. The staff are helpful and friendly, differently worth a visit."
,,Beautiful don't miss it!,5.0,,When we arrived there was a lot of activity. it's beautiful inside and well worth a visit! We incorporated it into a walk around Chinatown. A must see!
,,BEAUTIFUL BUILDING,5.0,,"This amazing temple is just a couple of minutes walk from the Chinatown Metro station, very impressive building. I believe is was built not that long ago. We arrived early in the morning and listened to the chanting. During our Holiday we have visited both Hindu and Sikh temples (in Delhi) and had no idea what to expect from a Buddist temple, the chanting was obviously attended by the local people who came daily to chant, then carry on with their day. There were at least 100 people lined up on chairs saying their chant. We asked, but they don't mind you taking photos or videos, although we tried to be respectful. The museum, on the upper floors, was really interesting, the history of the Buddah is told in the first person, with some amazing statues. The roof garden, wtih the Prayer Wheel, was charming and intimate. Amazingly, everything was wheelchair accessible. I am partially sighted and found the panels and explantions fairly easy to read. Very friendly staff."
,,Signature of Chinatown,5.0,,"It shows the pretty side of Chinese traditional temple and culture around the area. Also, I make a wish and hope it come true!"
,,What an amazing experience,5.0,,"We arrived during a service and stayed nearly two hours. My six year old sons got so much out of the whole museum and temple. There are five floors, visit each. The bathrooms are super clean and modern too."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,"If you like gold then this place is a must-see for you. The area where the Buddha tooth relic is placed is surrounded by real gold. It is quite a sight to see so much gold in one place, even the floor tiles are gold. Too bad pictures aren't allowed in the relic area. Other than that, photos are allowed in the other areas of the temple."
,,When in Chinatown don't walk past this jewel,4.0,,"While having lunch in the huge food market opposite a retired policeman pointed our attention to the Tooth Relic Temple. What a busy and impressive place. Do yourself a favor and read about the history, it is related to a similar temple in Mandi/ SriLanka. Take your time."
,,interesting,4.0,,"if you've been to buddhist temples elsewhere in asia, this might not be a ""grand"" site, but as a temple in singapore, it is quite a lavish temple. on the 4th floor, it houses the tooth relic - not that you can really see, since it's enclosed in several structures & behind a glass wall... but interesting, never the less. 3rd floor explained buddha's life & philosophy, with some artifacts & photos."
,,Interesting!,3.0,,Worth a visit if you have time and never been to a temple. However I would recommend skipping this to see other sights in the city if you are travelling to other parts of Southeast Asia.
,,All that glitters is gold...,4.0,,A wonderful buddhist temple to just wander through and people watch and ideally placed a 2 minute walk away from the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre which has wonderful food!
,,More than a temple !,5.0,,"The temple itself is very nice and easily accessible ! One can wonder inside and look at the various statues and read the explanations !
I asked someone at the entrance where I could find some explanations about the temple and I was directed to a nice lady who spent some time explaining the basics of Buddhism , showing me the various `''punishments'' associated with sins and letting me discover the second floor of the temple !
It was a very interesting cultural experience ! I do not know if I was lucky or if it is common over there but it may be worth asking for assistance !"
,,buddah museum,3.0,,This is a relatively new temple and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. There is a lot of buddhist statues and some interesting asian architecture. I had a quick walk around and found that was enough for me.
,,The epitome of peace,5.0,,"Spent a peaceful morning at the temple. Right in the middle of Chinatown, very easy to find. Stunning architecture, both inside and outside. The chants and the incense sticks will transport you to a different world. For once I noticed peace on the faces of the ever-busy Singaporeans. Such is the power of this place. Must visit. The temple was the last place I visited in Singapore and I got a huge surprise. Right outside the temple I accidentally spotted a sign board reading 'Banda Street'. Banda is our family name. I felt like I was called to the temple for a reason..."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,In the heart of Chinatown. Really nice Temple and interesting history. Worth a visit if you are in Chinatown.
,,Beautiful and enlightening experience on Buddhism,5.0,,"Insect, monks, Buddhas, and the biggest prayer wheel in the world...all in air con. It was great. They have prayer ceremonies on the first floor. On the roof is an orchid garden and 10,000 Buddhas, on the lower levels they walk you through the journey of the Buddha and even have a vegetarian restaurant that donates the proceeds to the homeless...good stuff all around...enjoy!"
,,Many different Buddhas inside,4.0,,"This Buddhist temple is located just next to China Town. When we were there, the streets were decorated with horses of all shapes and sizes in honor of the Chinese Year of the Horse. The temple I s an impressive multi-storied building and an active temple open to all. Inside you will see many different Buddha statues and be impressed by the symmetry of the arrangements. You may also see people worshipping as you are free to wander around and admire the colors and smell the incense. This temple is a treat for all the senses and you are allowed to take pictures. At the back entrance, you will find a tourist information stall with maps and helpful advice about Singapore. Across the street there is a huge food court."
,,good for lover of architecture,4.0,,the temple built long ago is well maintained and a place to visit. museum is also good. prayer time it is quite peaceful and well organised. nearby for shopping lover there is chinese market. u can get cheap things but do bargain.also watch out for duplicate things in the name of original. warranty is limited to singapor only.
,,Pleasant and holy atmosphere,5.0,,"This is my second visit in a year, this is a Buddhist temple but all can visit, This place is very clean and very well maintained I love the atmosphere it makes you calm and settled. It is situated at China town and worth a visit."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,It's an active temple. People studying while we were there to visit. Have covers that you can use to cover up if you're not wearing suitable attire. Knee length shorts are acceptable. Lots of gold and beautiful decoration. Definitely worth a visit
,,The real deal!,4.0,,"We were fortunate to arrive during a Buddhist ceremony with monks chanting and devotees praying. The building is imposing and beautiful. The authenticity of this temple is obvious. Remember the dress code: all must have covered shoulders - even short sleeves are permitted. Lovely, spiritual, beautiful, authentic. A must-see in Chinatown."
,,A stunning edifice.,5.0,,Allow yourself a good couple of hours to walk around and absorb all this place has to offer. Then go and satisfy your earthly hunger at the Maxwell Food Court that is diagonally across the street.
,,Beautiful! A must place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"We have stopped in the Biddah Tooth Relic Temple and Museum a few times during visits to Singapore. Located on the edge of Chinatown, it is peaceful and calming. The decotations are incredible and that alone is worth the visit. A must see in Singapore!"
,,SPELLBINDING little GEM,5.0,,WOW..i am amazed I missed it for so long..what a temple..amazingly well kept. super artifacts..awesome way to exhibit..great. great ..don't go with small children ;-)..they wont let you enjoy this marvel that much.
,,nice one!,5.0,,"I have been here once with my chinese friend. a quiet place for people who want to pray for their families, friends,..."
,,Impressive building,3.0,,Excellent architecture. I didn't go far inside. It felt too sacrilegious to walk through gawking at the monks chanting in their religious ceremony
,,Budham saranam gacchami,4.0,,located in china town the historic place. it was a replica of calm and sincerety. and telling the lesson of PEACE.
,,Can only see tooth on TV screen,3.0,,"The temple itself was well maintained, unlike those on mainland China, and on the ground floor I liked the painting of the 10 hells of Budism. On the 4th floor, you can visit the tooth, which is contained in a gold panelled room not accessible to the public. Either side of the bullet-proof glass is a small TV, which displays an old yellow and brown tooth. Not particularly impressive site."
,,Overwhelming in its spirituality,5.0,,Not to be missed a rare treat and view into a spiritual world many would never see. A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to this temple.
,,"A beautiful temple, well worth your time.",5.0,,The temple is stunning. You walk in through an incense haze into the temple. There are countless Buddha statues lining the walls and a large dais with massive Buddha statues. This temple is really the most awe-inspiring temple in Singapore.
,,Wonderful temple,4.0,,"beautiful and sacred place, free access, you can visit on your own. on the top floor there is a large prayer wheel. is a place of prayer and meditation for Buddhists."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"This is a great temple to visit. There are a number of temples to visit in Singapore but if you have to visit one, this is the one to visit."
,,An interesting temple,5.0,,Worth visiting as a part of a sightseeing tour to Singapore as it represents one of its most remarkable temples.
,,Go to the upstairs levels,5.0,,With active prayers on the main floor many people did not venture up to the upper floors and roof which house fascinating artifacts A don't miss!
,,A surprisingly enjoyable visit; very visitor-friendly,5.0,,"I visited the Buddha Tooth Relic thinking it would be just like any other temples, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of content that I found inside - enough for a good two-hour visit. Photography enthusiasts would be excited at how camera-friendly the temple is - in fact, it felt more of a tourist attraction than a religious site. There is also a vegetarian restaurant at the basement of the temple where proceeds go to charity. Also do spend some time at the museum no the top level which tells the story of Buddha's life. You'll have an oomm-teresting day ;)"
,,"Stunning, lots of Budha statues",4.0,,I really like the architecture and vibrant color. We visited during the chanting prayer hour. Interesting experience. About 10 mins walked from Chinatown station.
,,A little bit different,4.0,,"Most Buddhist temples don't claim to have a relic of the Buddha, and i can't swear this one does. I floor, but it's quite some distance behind a glass wall, shrouded by the shrine, and you aren't allowed to take pictures. A guard explained to me that this is for security--everything behind the glass is 24 kt gold, he said. So don't tell anyone. Still, it's quite a good temple, ad has the added bonus of a rooftop garden.

Get there from the Outram Park MRT station--if you use Chinatown you may never find it..."
,,A must,5.0,,It was my first Budda temple and I was very impressed Kindly the woman working there showed us the way up so do not miss upper floors with museum(4) and a garden (5)
,,Impressive,4.0,,"The temple is a hive of activity and is easy to visit. most temples blend into each other over time when you are visiting. This temple is constantly in use and is a great visit. It is important as a repository of Buddha relics, of which there are very few in the world. As a living temp the daily chants and service is also on constant view and is well done. Very worth a visit both for relics and to see a working temple."
,,A big temple in the middle of Chinatown,3.0,,"A trip to Chinatown would not be complete without a visit to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Admission is free, but you should be prepared to dress respectfully. When I visited I saw lots of robe-cladded monks roaming the temple, but mostly it was tourists taking photos of the interiors. There are plenty of statues of Buddha littered around, and it is almost impossible to look at all of them, even if you wanted to! I didn't spend long here, as it is not really a major attraction in itself, rather an added-on visit when you are in the Chinatown vicinity."
,,More glitz than you would believe possible,3.0,,"I may be being a bit unfair giving this just three stars, but it's just not my sort of place. In the last few years we have visited many places of worship, varying in age and glitz from Chartres to the Cardboard Cathedral via the Man Mo Temple and the Blue Mosque, all of which I found interesting and inspiring to the spirit; sadly the Buddah's Tooth temple was a shade too suggestive of Disney for me. I guess I must have left my karma at home."
,,"Nice, not amazing",3.0,,"From the review score, it seemed like this was one of the major must-see attractions in Singapore. Well, if you've never seen a Buddhist temple before, sure, it's cool, but otherwise, it's not very big and not as impressive as others I've seen. It's free and easy to access though, and won't take much time to visit, so I guess it's still on the to-do list."
,,Impressive Temple and Museum,5.0,,"As Buddha remains can only be found in three locations in the WORLD, visiting this Temple and Museum was an awe inspiring experience. The outside is quite impressive, and upon entering one cannot help but be overwhelmed by the statuary and construct of the interior. When we entered, a ""service"" was being conducted with monks and participants chanting and ringing bells. As we went through, one could not help but respect the religious practices we were witnessing.

When finally we went upstairs to see the urns with various Buddha body parts, again the presentation and respect exhibited were impressive. While there, a delightful man approached us to explain some of the sights were were seeing. He was not intrusive but quite helpful. So often, the kindness of others makes travel even more special.

I noted several tour groups being hustled through; that would not have been our way to visit this Temple. One needs time for introspection.

This was a one of many highlights of our two and one half weeks spent in Singapore with our daughter and her family. Singapore is a city/country of so many exciting contrasts."
,,Colorful and numerous display,4.0,,There are many different exhibibts to look at with this museum. There are also lots of informative plates to help explain the histrory and sotry behind many of the objects and the temple itseld
,,Lovely serene temple,5.0,,My husband and I visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple as part of our tour and it was just lovely. It is incredibly peaceful with a beautiful ambience about the place. I recommend going without a tour group as we did feel a little rushed.

,,Average,3.0,,"It was near our hotel, interesting place to visit especialy because we visited during the chinese new year, but not as entertaining as the temples in thailand, would visit only once."
,,Singapore,4.0,,"A man approached us, we thought he was with the Temple, he took us around & explained everything, we were a bit wary of any charge, but no it was for free, he only wanted us to visit his jewellery factory/shop. We polite declined & he left us."
,,Impressive,5.0,,You can't miss it in a Chinatown. It is a museum and operating temple. I liked it a lot. Service took place during our visit and it was also interesting experience.
,,An interesting site,5.0,,"The Buddha Temple is located right in the middle of Chinatown near everything. Unlike the Hindu temples, you do not need to remove your shoes or cover up if you are wearing shorts. It is very ornate inside with tons of red and gold colors. It has tons of Buddha statues (the skinny Buddhas). You can also watch people worshipping without bothering them. It doesn't take long to go through and is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area."
,,A culture refuge,5.0,,"There are four stories.
The first is the largest story is the on going practice place for Buddhist practitioners and a home for large Buddha statue and a small give shop.
the second floor is a tribute to the patrons and to the Buddhist masters who influenced the creation of the temple.
The third floor is a brilliant educational experience full of replicas and original of important Buddha;s artwork and description of the people, places, and things important to Mahayana Buddhism including a nice explanation of the big belly Bhodisatwa.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, the fourth floor is a refuge for meditation and home to the Buddha tooth relic. Meditation space is available in the fourth floor which is elevated and quite comfortable spot in the presence of the relic and the beautful surrounds, quite recommended!"
,,Inspiring,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum was inspiring. The temple itself is gorgeous, it always amazes me how much work people put into expressing their faith and celebrating their God. Service was being held on the day that I visited the temple, so I felt a bit odd about ""sightseeing"" while a group was praying, but it was fascinating to listen to the Buddhist priests (monks?) while they were practicing their rituals. I did not sign up for the actual tour to see the Buddha tooth, and only stayed in the temple for a short while (30 minutes or so) because I didn't want to interrupt their service. I am definitely glad that I stopped by though, as it is a beautiful place of worship.
Photos / video okay, no sari needed (but dress respectfully) and not required to remove shoes."
,,A Beautiful Surprise,5.0,,"This was the first place I visited in Singapore, and I did not really have any expectation. Situated in the heart of Chinatown, the temple looks relatively common from the outside. Stepping in, you will be welcomed by a massive amount of Buddha statues. And I mean in hundreds. The Buddhas are unique and I did not really get to examine whether none of it was the same. If you're lucky, you get to see a monk perform a chant. If you're luckier, you might see the entire lot of them during their rituals. It was an amazing insight on Buddhist practice and the temple itself is an impressive montage of religious artistry. Really, you will want to have your camera with you when you visit."
,,Best to go in a guided tour,3.0,,"One can miss so many things in this temple if not Chinese or Buddhist unless there is a guide. Interesting to hear the monks chant, to understand why there are golden buddha figurines everywhere (and how they got there). Little known fact is that food is served free at the basement."
,,Imposing Temple,5.0,,"Across from Maxwell Centre -chicken-rice- this monument was constructed not ten years ago. It is a huge temple, classic chinese with the upturned roof to ward evil spirits off. Red and black=water and fire, the two most important elements in chinese culture. Take time to meditate and permeate your spirit with the peace that surrounds you there."
,,Blessed,4.0,,"Truly impressive! A huge amount invested in the temple, buddhas & relics. Worth a visit. even if one is not religious. Temple is in China town and there are lots to see, eat & shop."
,,Chinatown Highlight,4.0,,"Spectacular piece of architecture and beautifully maintained it did feel a little ""touristy"" but still worth a look."
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,"The sheer size of this temple is impressive enough especially when looking from the outside. Then going in and all the beautiful colours, especially the gold of the Buddha is very impressive. We were lucky to see the end of a ceremony which was interesting. And you were allowed to take photos inside."
,,From a theology student,5.0,,"This temple really encapsulates the Chinese form of Buddhism that has flowered outside of mainland China. It's decor is extravagant yet traditional whilst the vast quantity of Buddha images hints at a more universal form of Buddhist worship. Some from a western background may see the design as tacky or a few touches too flamboyant, but to me it showed a vast and deep devotional vault that the designers saw should be filled with colour and quantity. Apart from the main temple and backroom (housing bodhisattva idols and their correspondence to the Chinese calendar), the temple housed a museum. Free to enter, this museum gave you a detailed step by step account of Sakyamuni's (the historical Buddha) life that was accompanied by various statues depicting corresponding events. It was even informative for me, someone who has studied the Buddhist way of life during university. Along with this, the museum had a large section on every Chinese person's favourite buddha: Maitreya- Big Bellied Buddha. Overall- lots of written information and a place to lose yourself in for an hour or two."
,,I love this place,5.0,,"The garden on top, the relic in the middle and the main hall all is pretty impressive and nice to visit (and free!)"
,,A must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"This temple is beautiful inside and out. We were lucky enough to arrive when the buddhists were doing their chants. It is very welcoming for visitors and you don't feel like you are intruding. The temple itself is huge and the museum upstairs is very informative and has plenty to see. My favourite part however was the rooftop garden with the giant prayer wheel. You can spend hours here just walking round taking everything in. It was also not crowded at all which was great and they provide scarfs and sarongs to visitors who have forgotten to dress appropriately (like myself), just make sure knees and shoulders are covered :)"
,,Don't miss it.,5.0,,In Chinatown a place of silence and religion. Temple is worth visiting. Don't miss the rooftop garden. This Buddhist temple is unique in this city.
,,Great Temple,5.0,,I love this temple. I did the 100 coin offering and experienced the monks chanting and playing their instruments as the followers joined in. It was a warm welcoming temple community. After the ceremony I watched as they paraded out. Beautiful statues and shrines in the heart of China Town.
,,"Fabulous, and just steps away",5.0,,"This magnificent site was just steps away from our Chinatown hotel. We visited more than once. Each time, it was clear that we were very welcome. The colors, incense, and Buddhas were captivating. An intense experience not to be missed."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"One of the 3 temples we visited while in Singapore. Its interior is just stunning, full of gold and huge range of Buddha's. Staff are very friendly and love answering questions. Just remember to cover up if you are female (throws and robes are provided upon entry)"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"We spent a good two hours visiting all floors of this stunning temple (apart from level two which was being renovated). The temple itself is just beautiful, completely over the top and I dare anyone not to be blown away by the solid gold altar which holds the actual tooth relic itself.

Staff are extremely friendly and approachable, admission is free and you're allowed to take photographs in most areas of the temple. Definitely well worth a visit - followed by a trip to Food Street which us just around the corner : )"
,,Learn about the History of Buddhism,5.0,,"I wasn’t quite sure what to expect at the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and was pleasantly surprised at what I found -- Buddha’s of many sizes, from three large statues to hundreds (maybe thousands) of miniature Buddha’s adorning the walls. Amid the gold, red and glitter, there was a real sense of spirituality.

I was greeted by a staff member who offered me a sarong (because my dress was “too short”). Thank goodness shoes were allowed in most of the space, as is it humongous. We visited all the floors excepts for the 2nd, which was closed to repairs.

On the third floor, there was an exhibit retelling the life of Buddha and featured an impressive array of Buddhist artifacts, from scrolls to statues, explaining the three types of Buddhism. Photos are allowed, but no flash-photography. Plan accordingly as the room is dimly lit. The fourth floor provided space for those who want to meditate (there were monks in their golden robes when we visited). Make sure to climb up to the rooftop garden and find a spot on one of the benches for quiet reflection. A beautiful Prayer Wheel is housed in a tower right in the center, amid the gorgeous greenery.

TIP: For women, make sure your shoulders and knees are covered. This is a place of worship, so treat it as such :)"
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"interesting temple to visit, go also to upper floors (there is a lift), 4th floor roof garden peaceful and nice"
,,Girls beware,4.0,,"Girls make sure you are have covered shoulders and that your legs are also covered, but still worth the look and there is quite a few floors to check out. Right all side the markets, Smith st Markets"
,,Nice lovely place even if you are not religious,4.0,,"I always try to drop by when I am around the Chinatown area. The roof garden is lovely and I always feel serene when visiting. Take a lovely hour or so to walk each level where there's a museum, tea house, shop and temple grounds."
,,Peaceful and Serene,5.0,,"Great location, Beautiful from outside and amazing from inside. This place is a must visit in singapore"
,,Very nice,4.0,,It is a very nice place. We went on a saturday and we saw a prayer ceremony. The bulding itself is very beautiful too.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I loved this temple, it was a very sacred place. I almost felt uncomfortable taking photos in there. I felt that I was an intruder but I did take photos because it was so beautiful and as an Australian we dont see things like that in our country.Worthy of a visit"
,,Good value vegetarian food,4.0,,Good value. Clean place for vegetarian meal. There is at least variety of 3 dishes to choose from. It comes with soup and you could also order some drinks or coffee. Donation of at least $3 for each meal.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"The decor...the artifacts...the people...the garden...the prayer wheel...and it's all free! Again, this was something we chanced upon as we were checking out China town and we spotted it from the eating market across the way. Popped over the road and boy are we glad we did, there's the Dragon Room, 1000 buddahs and so much more. Another recommended visiting spot in this city of delights!"
,,best temple visit,5.0,,"We loved our trip to this temple.
It is a stunningly beautiful building, with so many architectural details. The whole place is spotlessly clean and even noisy, dunderklumpen Western tourists are made to feel welcome.
We were guided by a lovely man with a wicked sense of humour, who gave us many many details of Buddha's history, and the history of the building.
There are only a couple of areas where you can't take photos, and he was quite clear about that in a polite way.
We got to turn the prayer wheel, and pour water on a Buddha for blessing, and seeing the different art styles between Busshist countries was really interesting.
Our only regret was that we had to cut our visit short and get back to the airport.
If you can only see a couple fo things in Singapore, this should be on your short-list!"
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Been there today and it was amazing! But make sure you go there before 5 pm because after that time you cannot go to the top. Unfortunately I was a bit too late, but the good thing is I was almost alone in the temple as most of the tourists were already gone ;-)"
,,Interesting and peaceful Temple,5.0,,"My friend and I were out early and arrived here as a service was taking place. It was lovely, peaceful and serene. All the floors in the temple offered something of interest especially the Museum and Orchid Garden on the roof."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This was such an interesting place. Buddhas everywhere. If visiting China town make sure you go here.
,,A tranquil oasis,4.0,,"Lovely place to spend a few hours. The main hall was very very busy with tourists and devotees. We went up to the roof garden and had the place to ourselves very well maintained and a tranquil. Oasis in the middle of Chinatown. The main shrine is breathtaking and made of solid gold. Other floors give a history of the shrine, history of the museum..which has only been there a few years....and the history of Buddism. Well worth a visit."
,,clear symbol of spirituality,4.0,,"We really experienced peace and happiness while in this temple for sometime.The huge sculpture of Buddha is awesome and you feel like just looking at it endlessly.We were given a book titled--A Gift of Peace and Happiness, by a disciple of Buddha."
,,A pleasant surprise in Chinatown Street Market,4.0,,"As a tourist, a nice spot, if you want to cool off and see some culture. Dress code required--wraps available for those in shorts. Photos allowed inside. We visited on Chinese New Year and the place was packed--good timing for our experience."
,,Peaceful and Serene!,5.0,,"Standing in the temple, you can feel the serenity peacefully flow through your veins. Wonderful. Also, on a hot day, it is an air conditioned oasis."
,,A Chinatown Sight,5.0,,"Most travelers won't make it there because they do the Pagoda St and Mariamman Temple run only, but they are missing the best. Lots of sights and sounds, A feast for eyes and soul. Read the btrts dot org website for background info, and leave your speakers on ;-)"
,,very beautiful place,4.0,,the temple is a very nice place to visit.. it has 5 floors.. and on the top floor you have a very peaceful garden where you can rest. It feels like you are not in Chinatown anymore.
,,Sunday morning,4.0,,"Went with a friend in a quiet Sunday morning and stumbled upon a prayer session. The temple is beautiful and worth a visit and is free, just remember to dress appropriately - or they will loan you items."
,,An inspiring experience...,5.0,,"I first visited the Temple in April, 2013. It was a deeply spiritual experience. I returned in October, 2013, having by then converted to Buddhism.....even if you are not a Buddhist or even spiritual, it's a very interesting, calming, thought-provoking place. The staff are very welcoming and willing to answer questions. You can freely observe just about everything that is going on and take photos most of the time. The rooftop garden is charming too.....if you want to delve further, pop into the little shop...interesting items there, including music and books..."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,Grand grand temple! Never saw so much gold in my whole life! Many interesting religious souvenirs to buy.
,,Pleasant and Interesting,5.0,,"This is one of the cheapest trips you can include in your itinerary as there's no fee to enter this temple and museum. The place is also huge and probably one of the few major temples in Singapore. What makes this interesting is it stands in the middle of a highly-developed city, in stark contrast to the modern architecture almost everywhere in Singapore.

The intricate Chinese-inspired decoration inside the temple is just breathtaking. Bring your camera as it's possible to take pictures inside. There are plenty of photo opportunities here, but it's important to maintain proper decorum and be discreet so as not to disturb the people praying inside.

Of note, it's possible to see monks in the prayer area in deep meditation because this is an active Buddhist temple.Also, much like other Buddhist temples, appropriate clothing is required, so no short skirts or sleeveless tops are allowed. There are, however, drapes at the entrance which tourists can put on when they go inside the temple, and there's no charge for borrowing them.

For those looking for souvenirs, just outside the temple, there are some stalls selling cheap keychains, fans, purses, shirts, and magnets, so you can go straight to shopping after visiting this place. Do go to this place whenever you're visiting Chinatown in Singapore. It's worth the walk."
,,Better than we expected,5.0,,"OK, so there are Buddha relics at temples around the world, but this one is beautifully done. We enjoyed spending 30 minutes wandering and seeing the galleries inside."
,,Secret garden on the roof,4.0,,"Be sure to dress properly to enter this temple. Shorts and skirts are not allowed and they will give you something to put on (at no cost). Entry is free and photography is not allowed in the tooth room but it is quite interesting to see. It is an active temple so you should be quiet and observe the instructions.

On the way out the other side, an employee of the temple informed me that we could take the elevator up to the rooftop garden. This was worth the trip up. It is like an oasis in the middle of the city."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"One of the most likeable buddhist temples I have ever seen. You should not miss this one in the center of Chinatown next to a lot of stalls. It's already beautiful from the outside after entering you will see a praying room, lot of statues, buddhas, a small exhibition with the story of buddha, a meditation room and a garden of the roof with 10.000 tiny buddhas."
,,very uniqe,5.0,,The 5 storiesbuilding is beautiful fm the outside and thhe inside as well.when you walk around the city you don`t see many temples and those that you see are usuallysmall ones. There aresigns that explains what you see and you can take pictures as well.on the fifth floore there`s a wonderfull small garden to relex.
,,Tourist friendly site,4.0,,This free entry temple is actively used by Buddhists praying to the gods represented here. You can see the interesting exterior and interior in 15-0 min.
,,Really very interesting and enjoyable,5.0,,"Surprisingly I really enjoyed this.

Coming from a non-religious background this is not really my cup of tea but could not help but be impressed by the building and internal decoration. Quite stunning. Certainly as a place of worship it is considerably more visually enjoyable and colourful than dour European churches.

The fact that it was actively being used added extra atmosphere.

Make sure you visit the roof garden and prayer wheel.

I was heartened by the sound of dull-sounding incantations of a monk who, on closer inspection, actually turned out to be on his mobile phone. Made my day.

Go visit."
,,OK if you are Buddhist,2.0,,"Bright, garish, loud. I've seen plenty of red and gold Chinese Buddhist temples in Thailand over the last 10 years and this was no exception. To see the 'buddhist tooth' you have to pay more and yes, it's yet another rip-off.

If you are the sort of person who thinks they are in tune with all this stuff, then go. Otherwise, go and have a beer or a bite to eat."
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,I was able to visit the temple during the preparations for Chinese New Year. Beautiful place! I could have spent several hours wandering around. My shoulders were covered and I had longer pants on however wraps were available if you are not appropriately dressed. Would definitely go back if I am ever in Singapore again!
,,Relaxing and Informative,5.0,,"The temple is across the street from the Maxwell Street Food Centre, so we decided to walk through it. We happened to enter during the middle of a service and enjoyed the chanting. I was offered a shawl at the entrance to cover my shoulders. The personnel were very polite and seemed eager to have visitors explore the temple.

We then went up to the upper floors to the exhibits and enjoyed learning more about the life of Buddha.

Don't miss the roof top garden - so tranquil and beautiful. The basement cafeteria offers vegetarian food, but we didn't sample any."
,,A great Chinese temple in China Town,5.0,,"This is a great Chinese temple to visit, especially in January during Chinese New Year.

The temple is not busy inside and you can freely walk around experiencing the delights.

An essential place to visit and a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of China town!"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,My husband and I visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum in January 2014. It is extremely well done. The temple and museum is on multiple floors accessible by elevator. Lots to see and and information to discover. Entry was free and wraps available if not suitably dressed. Well worth the visit.
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"A beautiful, quiet and authentic temple at the heart of bustling Chinatown displaying impressive buddha statues."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I visited several temples in Asia. This stand apart from the other temples that I visited. There is a lot invested in the whole temple. There is history and displays and education and relics on multiple floors. There are quiet spots and busy spots. It seems like there are thousands and thousands of Buddha statues throughout.
It's appropriate to call it a ""temple and museum"". It is both -- excellent temple and excellent museum. There are relics unlike anything in temples in China. Very impressive. It is worth a visit when you are in Singapore."
,,beautiful temple,5.0,,We visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and enjoyed looking through the Temple and looking at all the relics. This place is definitely worth visiting whilst in Singapore.
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"I'm a muslim but always like a nice place to relax especially with a great and historic architectural design. This building is just one of it and I;m really surprise to see this kind of building in Singapore. I thot this kinda building or temple can be found in China or Japan only.
Nevertheless, the place is very near Chinatown and it is sooo squeaky clean. Everybody can go in and enjoy the temple. Though the burning incense smell may hurts your nose like it did to me.
Another thing is, the people working here are so friendly as they will assist in every possible way, but you may want to give some donation to the temple before you leave ;-)"
,,Relax,5.0,,"As we are Buddhist, this place is very cool for us. Nice Bhudda and Guan Imm, many historical about Buddha.

Place is very nice for relaxing and mediation, we can pray in the cool (air con whole building), we love most that garden on the roof with the life wheel."
,,Beautiful temple in Chinatown,3.0,,"I visited this temple for 2 times when I visit Chinatown. The first time I think the temple is nothing special and it is not totally Chinese style. The second time, the temple was decorated with lantern. Wow! The temple is amazing with lantern. It looks like temple in Japan. If you go to Chinatown, why not visit it!? It is just next to Chinatown Complex :D"
,,Wonderful temple,5.0,,"In my opinion the most beautiful temple of Chinatown and well maintained. I was impressed by the interior, certainly because of the wall with buddhas."
,,Busy especially during weekends,3.0,,"I'm not too keen on temples, and to me, they all look the same. But it's nice to see a sacred place right in the middle of busy Chinatown. You can often see the locals who would pay a visit at the temple then walk down the small streets of Chinatown for their market needs."
,,Beautiful temple.....,4.0,,"The building is well maintain, as if it was newly build, it was very clean, in spite the alot of people walking in and out taking picture and watching the monk praying. Due to time constrain i only walk thru the ground floor, but i didn't pass up to make a small donation (10 sg dollar) for a 100 pcs of coin to drop around on 100 pcs buddha statue for blessing"
,,A very interesting place to visit.,4.0,,We went there for a look and were most surprised by the set-up of the place. The relics and statues etc. were very beautiful as was the whole temple. Interesting to see and well worth a visit.
,,Best temple to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Out of all the temples we toured in Singapore, this was the most interesting and visually stunning. Women need to cover up to enter, but they have free shawls to borrow. There is a front and back section, souvenir sales, free Buddhist books, and lots to see. Definitely worth visiting!"
,,Overwhelming experience,5.0,,"This is one of kind temple, overwhelming to our senses. Hundreds of Buddha statues, a truly serene environment."
,,Amazing amount of gold,4.0,,"There are four floors plus the roof garden of things to see and it was well worth the visit. There is a strict dress code so no bare shoulders or skimpy mini skirts or shorts .... they do have shawls you can use to cover up. This is a holy site so we were reminded to be respectful. Each floor holds an amazing array of Buddhas from the tiny to enormous and all surrounded by an amazing array of flowers and gold. The tooth of the Buddha is housed on the 4th floor, secured behind glass, amidst the most amazing display of gold ... not least, all is placed on a gold floor. Make the walk to the roof garden where you will see an enormous Buddhist prayer wheel. Allow extra time for your visit as there is a lot to see"
,,religius place,3.0,,the place location is centre of the china town. we can go there by walking from the people's park building. it si near and many shops selling oriental handycraft.
,,very good,5.0,,"beautiful temples we need to visit, we were lucky because each time we vacation in Singapore for taking the time to visit Buddhist temples Teeth"
,,Holy Buddha,5.0,,"PEACEFUL, SERENE AND HOLY, that is how i will describe the Temple,amazing building and they really know how to keep the temple Holy and peaceful,nice cultural exchange and even in Taipei we have beautiful temples,this one is special of the organising way they explain Buddha teaching and visits."
,,Opulent!,5.0,,"An absolutely gorgeous temple for this first time Canadian visitor, recommended by a friend who visited years ago. Stunning colours, sights, sounds and smells. Immerse yourself in this wonderful cultural experience and enjoy so you too can Tell A Friend : ) So serene!"
,,Stop in if you are in Chinatown,3.0,,"This is not a destination, just have a look if you are in Chinatown already. It was not clear how to get up to the rooftop which was my primary interest."
,,Lovely cultural spot in Singapore,4.0,,Who knows that you can find such lovely cultural spot in the middle of busy Chinatown? The place is so serene that you can just be there to sit and take in the atmosphere of the temple. I suppose this place is even more lively during Chinese New Year event.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,If you are coming to Singapore..Must visit... Its a lovely temple.. I was amazed by the beauty of the temple..
,,Must see in Singapore!,5.0,,This place is surrounded by a market where you can buy souvenirs etc. I walked on it by an accident and wow! such an amazing temple! lots of statues and things to see. I enjoyed it a lot!
,,Nice to get to know a different culture,4.0,,We went there during the new years celebrations and so we got to see some interesting rituals. All in all I would recommend going there since a visit is easily combinable with a trip to china town.
,,An Excellent Place To Spend A Meditative Afternoon,4.0,,A nice temple to visit and view the Buddha Tooth Relic and Museum. It's very serene as you enter the temple and relax with the hypnotising Buddhist chants by the monks and the worshippers on the ground level. Level 4 houses the museum and Buddha relics with a raised platform area for visitors to meditate and rest the soul.
,,"In the heart of Chinatown, a place of tranquility and wonderment",5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic is actually the least exciting part of this wonderful Temple and Museum - the Buddha museum is an exhaustive but beautiful history of Buddhism, housing artefacts, statues and displays. It is worth climbing up to the top of the building too, for the enormous prayer wheel and small, perfectly formed water garden."
,,Jewel in Chinatown's crown,5.0,,"This is an amazing temple. It is very popular so be prepared to move slowly but that's the best way really as it allows you to absorb all the incredible details on all of the floors. Admission is free and photography is allowed except on the floor where the Buddha's tooth is found. No bare shoulders are allowed and shoes have to be removed to enter the Buddha's tooth room. There is a lift available to move between the floors.
Ornate is perhaps an understatement but it really is a beautiful temple. Look at the detail ...some of the craftsmanship is truly incredible.
Can be reached on the Hop on hop off bus service and is only a short walk from the bus stop."
,,Sanctuary in the middle of Chinatown,5.0,,I missed this last place during our last visit and so decided to have a look this time. It was an engaging experience to go through the temple and museum. There is so much of culture and history under one roof. Highly recommended!
,,It was a really huge and beautiful temple for me but...,3.0,,"To be honest it may be one of the most beautiful temple, it look so fancy and glamorous as a buddhist temple especially in the tooth relic room. Too bad it was too far and make me dissapointed because i didnt even can see the relic at all due too it was too far and sealed with the ornament.

They also have museum that show statues and buddhist art and that was quiet interesthing to see. You can always donate for the temple and you can even use credit card as payment method.

It located around 10 min walking from the chinatown MRT and you better ask the local where it is located since it located in the middle of chinatown.

But, I also quiet sad because this temple seems like so commercialized. I agree that this temple is really beautiful and glamorous, but I feel like it is too over as a buddhist temple and does not really show down to earth like other buddhist temple. For example in the tooth relic room, when you see the ceiling it has too many light and I feel like it is too over."
,,Interesting building,4.0,,While we were there a service was in progress which was quite amazing to watch and listen to.. Be warned you cannot go in without covered shoulders so shawls are available in the front entrance.
,,Loved chinatown and this temple,5.0,,This was a highlight of our trip ..beautiful buddha statues and relics..very informative and set out well . Be sure to cover up and respect the locals worshipping...
,,enter and be amazed,5.0,,"From the outside, one might think that this is just your ordinary Chinese temple, but once you enter this place, you will be fascinated on how beautiful everything was designed and constructed.

It has wall to wall mini-idols and a three large ones at the front center of the temple.

Picture taking and flash photography is very much allowed in the temple area, except for the museum.

Overall, it is definitely worth the trip."
,,Beautiful building,2.0,,This is a beautiful building filled with beautiful statues. The atmosphere was very soft and gentle. It was a nice break from the hostle and bustle of Chinatown outside of the building.
,,Free to the public,4.0,,"Free to the public the temple is breathtaking both in and outside. The walls are cover in gold with supposedly a tooth from Budda that was found 2000 years ago in India. No photos are allowed of the tooth, but throughout the temple feel free to take pictures. You'll even see some individuals praying in the temple. Women will have to wear a sash to cover their legs in which is provided for free. All in all can't beat the price of something free and unique."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Whether you are religious or not, a believer or not, this is, in my opinion, a must visit. It has a museum on one level and a lovely orchid garden on the roof. It's amazing with the little buddhas all around the temple and the intricate embriodery on the walls (at the 'Goddess of Mercy' hall). There has been some debate about the ""tooth relic"" but whatever it is, it is still a wonderful place to reflect and soak in peace."
,,"Great food, stunning museum",4.0,,"Vegetarian food available for donation in café on lower floor. Clean. The Temple etc is also stunning, decorations etc, and a good shop with plenty of books."
,,A Modern and Gorgeous Temple,4.0,,"The temple is free to visit and I was surprised because it must take a large sum of money to run such a huge,multiple-function and modern temple.However,you are not allowed to wear vest or shorts to enter it .You will have to wrap yourself in a piece of cloth it provides if you wear vest or shorts and want to go in.
We walked around the whole Chinatown area that day and visited two Buddhist temple.One was Thian Hock Keng Temple and the other one was Buddha Tooth Relic Temple&Museum.To me,this one was better than Thian Hock Keng Temple.
As a Chinese,I had been to several Buddhist temples in China and I found the architectural style in Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was similar to temples in China,especially Hanshan Temple in Suzhou.Actually,this temple is built with Tang Architectural style-massive and gorgeous,and I really love it because I am a big fan of Tang Dynasty.
On the first floor,there are many sculptures carved vividly.Although I am not a Buddhist,I worshiped because most Chinese grow up steeped in Buddhist culture and I am no exception.There are some articles on the wall introducing the different kinds of hells in Buddhism.Buddhism is about karma and they believe that if you do something wrong,you will end up in the hell.Actually,this is the common point of many religion which tells us to do good deeds.
On the second floor,there are gifts for this temple from all over the world and I was impressed by the traditional atmosphere there.I was happy to find some gifts from Guangdong because I am a Cantonese.
Because of the time limit,I didn't go to other floors,but I take some books from the shelves(they are free for people to take).I learnt about the five taboos that Buddhist should obey in the book.
Actually,I think the only disadvantage of this temple is also its advantage-it's too modern.It has perfect air-conditioning and elevator but personally,I think a temple should be more traditional.I know that it will be very hot and inconvenient for visitors if it doesn't provide these,but sometimes our culture makes us adamant in some issues.I think a Buddhist temple should be plain without too many decorations or too much technology elements."
,,Nice oriental building,5.0,,"An elaborate oriental building with multiple floors. The tooth is kept in the higher level where donors cover the walls,with gold effigies of Buddha. The roof top, if you go, is a lovely garden and a bit of Tibetan style pray bells. Love the architecture."
,,Architecture and relics,4.0,,"Unfortunately the large buddha in the center of the ground floor was covered and under construction, but it was still worth going to see the space. Each level of the building has its own features and exhibits, culminating in the golden room with the tooth at the top. The rooftop garden was also quite beautiful. Worth a stop if you're strolling through Chinatown."
,,BUDDHA TOOTH RELIC TEMPLE & MUSEUM,4.0,,"LIKES:
1)The wonderful collections of religious relics.
2)The displays are well done; with good clear notes in several languages. the lightings are good too.
3)The roof top garden is well done; giving one a greenery break from the busy streets around China Town area.
4)The vegetarian food is reasonable, both in price and quality
DISLIKED:
1)The prices for the artifice are too high.
2)The management of the food area can be improved.
3)The management of human flow traffic during peak session can be improved."
,,Lots of heritage significance,5.0,,Beautiful temple. We will have to cover yourself up if you are wearing anything sleeveless and anything above knee level. They do provide sarong to wrap yourself up. Entrance is free so worth the visit.
,,Cultural parts in the middle of modern Singapore,4.0,,"Located in the middle of Chinatown, in front of the Maxwell Hawker Center, this place is definitely worth to visit (it's free!). Learn full history of Buddhism in the museum, see the relics of Buddha and the golden statue inside, a lot of statue not only originated from China but also from India, Myanmar, Thailand, and other places. Wear proper clothes (no tanktops and shorts). Visit the small garden on the rooftop."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,Really work a visit. No restricted access so can see all parts of the Temple even the second with services/ceremonies ongoing. The garden on the roof is very tranquil and the museum is a great summary of Buddhism. If you're there over lunch the food hall in the basement serves great vegetarian food for donation.
,,well worth seeing,5.0,,This budha temple is found nearest China town and is the highlight of this area. All historical streets are also near by like Smyth pagoda Streets. Maxwell Road hawker food centre across the road is a must visit for its chicken an rice at Thian Thian food stall
,,Modern - but definately worth experiencing!,5.0,,"Walked by this temple a few times - but did not go in as it is a new build. However when I did I was blown away by the Buddah's, the art and the quality of workmanship inside. It is a working temple and so lots of things are happening all the time. A must visit!!!"
,,Great temple,5.0,,"This was the first temple where I saw that you had to cover your shoulder if you came in a tank top, but it didn't matter, because the air-condition was making the place too cold anyway. But the temple and the museum is nice, interesting place to visit with a lot of relics. If you come at the right time (as I did) you could also experience the monks praying, and remember to go up to the roof to see the garden there as well."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"If your in Singapore I am sure your going to Chinatown! If not your crazy, Chinatown here is as good as it gets outside China. Great food, friendly people, good shopping and great things to see like this Temple, your here and it's FREE, enjoy it."
,,Beautiful Buddhist temple,4.0,,"This temple is located in China town, very close the the night market. It has a main entrance and a rear entrance. I happened to enter from the back and thought the place was beautiful, but the main hall in the front is just magnificent. It has a high ceiling, the walls are lined with hundreds of little golden Buddha and bodhisattva statues and the ceiling has golden hanging lanterns. There are three big statues in the center and the room is all gold and red and very bright. It looked like an active place of worship, however, when I went only a few people were paying respects. The scent of burning incense filled the place and I had the pleasure of witnessing a few school girls in school uniforms enter and light incense in the big urn that is positioned at the center of the main door and pray. This temple is worth a visit if you are in the area, if you want to worship or if you would just like to visit a beautiful temple."
,,amazing collection,5.0,,"One of the must-see in Singapore. It has an amazing collection and display of Buddha statues. I'd describe it as spectacular and beautiful. Out of respect, we were required to cover up our bare arms and legs. Not to worry because shawls and ""skirts"" were provided. There were free books on Buddhism located just outside the entrance of the temple."
,,Must-see,4.0,,"The Temple in itself is a wonderful place to visit, and if you climb up to the higher floors there is much to see. Really beautiful, and an educational experience. The location of the temple makes this visit easily coupled with a great local-style meal at Maxwell Hawker Center or in Chinatown, or a drink in one of the funky bars on Club Street nearby."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Another must-see in Singapore. This is in the heart of Chinatown, near lots of other activities (shopping and eating, Maxwell Rd Hawker Center is across the street). It's one of the most beautiful temples of this type I have seen. Also a bit ""different"" in that it is air-conditioned and has an underground car park. There is a great museum on one of the upper floors; the floor where the tooth relic is housed is simply stunning; the rooftop garden has a huge prayer wheel in it's center."
,,"Extraordinary idols, peaceful place",5.0,,"Worth seeing not only for religious people, but also for anyone who would appreciate the intricate design of the idols. there are so many of them, big and miniature..

It is right in the heart of china town, which is also a tourist spot. Many souvenir shops around, many road side food joints with local food."
,,"Impressive, educational, and beautifully colorful -- worth a visit",5.0,,"Located in Singapore's bustling Chinatown, this is exactly what it sounds like: a temple and museum that houses a treasured relic purported to be the tooth of Buddha. Admission is free. The building is spacious and beautifully constructed, with each of the five floors housing lovely and educational displays -- read on to be sure you don't miss something!

The first floor is an active temple where you are likely to stumble across a live service. I know it's hot in Singapore, but are your shoulders and knees covered? If not, borrow a modesty shawl, available near the entrance, and carry on. Walk around the perimeter of the first floor and be astonished by the floor-to-ceiling stacks of red-and-gold Buddhas, hundreds of them, each in a subtly different position. You can even find your zodiac protector at the display in the far atrium.

The mezzanine has a great view of the central temple floor and is lined with the photos and histories of especially revered Buddhist monks. You can also visit the Ancestral Memorial Hall in back. The second floor was mostly closed when I visited (it is meant to have a tea room and Buddhist text library) but had a small gift shop and a visual gallery of the museum's brief history.

The third floor houses a collection of Buddhist artifacts that -- along with text in Chinese and English -- illustrates the events in the life of the Buddha. There are also holy relics worth walking past even if you're not ""into"" that sort of thing. Note: most of the relics in the temple are sarira, or ringsel — tiny pearl-like beads that allegedly form during a very holy person’s cremation. They are beautiful, glimmering and sometimes colored like gems, which makes it even more strange to read a caption like, “Big Intestine Relic” underneath. If anyone has scientific information about this phenomenon, please drop a line; I'm very curious.

The fourth floor houses the Buddha's tooth relic. You can't necessarily SEE the tooth -- you can only peer into the sealed-off room where it’s enshrined in an elaborate, stunning reliquary of pure gold and surrounded by guardian statues and gold floor tiles. I am not Buddhist but I got chills when I paused in front of the relic. Whether that is the tooth of Buddha or not, I cannot tell, but it is without doubt an artifact vested with power. People have prayed before it for centuries.

Appropriately, the viewing chamber is peaceful and quiet; there are cushions provided, strictly for meditation. See if you can sit a little while and soak in some serenity.

By now, you've probably seen a few thousand Buddhas. Can I convince you to view 10,000 more? Seriously, it's worth it. The fifth floor is a beautiful little rooftop garden with the Pagoda of Ten Thousand Buddhas in the center. Enjoy the fresh air and the abundant orchids, then give the MASSIVE prayer wheel a spin!

Well done, you. Consider making a donation, lighting some incense and wishing someone well -- and of course, don't forget to return your shawl. And remember: you're in Chinatown so whether you want more religious immersion (the beautiful Sri Mariamman temple and Jamae Mosque are just a couple blocks away) or some delicious food (um, everywhere), you're in luck!"
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,Located in Chinatown. Temple is open to the public but be reverent. There are worshippers praying there. Impressive interior and altars. One of the prettiest I've seen in this part of Asia.
,,Best of Chinatown,5.0,,"An exellent combination between a living temple and a museum, Filled with music, smells and devoted people, but also quiet corners and a lot of history. Educational and very pretty."
,,Excellent temple,5.0,,"Well worth the visit. This beautiful temple is very close to the MRT train station. The temple is absolutely stunning and serene, very informative. I learned a lot during our visit here"
,,Worth visiting,3.0,,"It wasn't breath taking for me, but since i was around chinatown a lot, and i passed by a few times, i said why not.
There was a ritual going on or something, which i think it was the best.
I think i all comes up whether you are into culture... But still i would go and have a quick look."
,,Educational,5.0,,"The main temple at ground floor is spectacular, but don't stop there. Take the lift to the 3rd floor for an educational display of the journey of Buddha, and then to the 4th floor to see the Buddha tooth relic, and finally to the roof top orchid garden with 10000 Buddha's."
,,Only real reason to go to Chinatown,4.0,,"Great temple, but relatively new. Several floors including a museum of Bhuddism. Can get crowded at times. The rest of Chinatown is pretty much the same as any other Chinatown in any city, selling tourist garbage. Maxwell hawker center across the street from the temple supposedly has the best chicken rice place in town, don't remember the name, but can't miss it, there is always a line. Bourdain raved about it so it has acheived cult like status, not the center is closed on Monday's."
,,A colourful introduction to Buddhism,4.0,,"Right in the heart of Chinatown, the temple is relatively new. It gives a fascinating insight into Buddhist worship. Local devotees don't seem to mind tourists looking or taking photos, though one should always be respectful. For English speakers there's sufficient signage to help you better understand and appreciate your visit. Well worth a look."
,,Nothing much because of renovation,3.0,,At the moment they are renovating the temple so didnt see much of it. Didnt see the famous tooth unfortunately. Happy i did see it because the walls are covered with buddha's which is something I havent seen before.
,,A peaceful break,4.0,,"This is a lovely temple complex in the middle of hectic Singapore. The museum in particular was beautiful with some exquisite examples of Buddhist art and sculpture, ancient and contemporary. It is welcoming of visitors in the temple itself as well as the other floors containing the museum, roof too garden and relic."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,We went on a Saturday so there was a service which added interest. Very calm place with lots of history. Worth a visit - no charge!
,,Hidden gem in Chinatown,5.0,,"Not many people find this Temple but it is beautiful, colourful and if you want to know about Buddhism, there is a small, cleverly put together museum upstairs. The roof garden is very spiritual and has the worlds biggest prayer wheel up there. Who would have guessed. A must for locals and tourists. Modesty shawls provided. This is a working busy temple so expect to see a service running with the saffron monks chanting. A beautiful, special place."
,,Interesting temple - lots of Buddhas,3.0,,"Nice temple in Chinatown. It's colourful and easy to navigate, with many, many different representations of Buddha lining the walls. We didn't have time to explore upstairs but well worth having a look here."
,,Worth seeing in Singapore,4.0,,"Interesting Buddhist temple in Chinatown. Nice colours, statues, Buddhist tradition and even monks. One of the interesting attractions in Singapore especially for westerns."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"So many Buddhas, so much colour...a must for anyone who likes visiting temples. One of the best we have seen."
,,Do not miss this Temple when in Chinatown,5.0,,"A visually delightful experience, if you visit just one temple in Singapore make it the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Photography is allowed in most (almost all) areas. Free entry to all of the various levels of the temple. You must wear one of the shawls provided to cover your shoulders (if bare). There is a prayer wheel at the top. Apparently there is free vegetarian food in the basement which we did not find out until after we had visited. We came back with some beautiful photos of the interior and exterior of the temple."
,,Glittering Golden Figures,5.0,,"Stepping inside this temple is almost blinding- rows and rows of golden figurines stackedg on top of each other, stories high. It was a pleasure to see something so different, and to be among the reverent worshippers. Try to wear clothes that cover upper arms and thighs, or there is a basket of wraps you may use."
,,Breathtakingly stunning in its beauty,5.0,,"I visited this temple while walking around Chinatown. When you walk inside, your breath is taken away by the opulent beauty of the temple. What is not made clear is that you need to visit each of the 5 floors (including the roof garden). The floor with the tooth relic is located on the fourth floor and is in a golden sanctuary with gold floors behind glass. There is also a very interesting Buddhist museum on the third floor. Of all of the Buddhist and Hindu temples that I visited in Singapore, this was the most impressive - it's a definite must see."
,,A Buddhist temple,4.0,,"A Buddhist temple Impressive traditional architecture. The museum is rich in exhibits recalling the history, culture and civilization of the places."
,,A visual treat,4.0,,A visual treat to see the colors inside the temple. The prayers and chanting makes it a great experience.
,,Possibly the Best Religous Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"I have been travelling to Singapore for the last 30 years and have never taken the opportunity to visit this temple. What a mistake!
We were lucky on our visit as there was a service taking place whilst all the tourist walked around the edge of the temple and observed the chanting and prayers taking place.So colourful and the monks were happy for photographs to be taken.
Best to walk in through the front entrance and out the back straight into China Town"
,,Definitely worth visiting,4.0,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a very facinating place to visit. Beautifullly designed and decorated building alone is worth visiting but once you step inside, you are greeted by number of Buddhas and makes you feel really calm. Even if you are not Buddhist, you will be able to appreciate the beauty of the place and its atmosphere."
,,Very shiny!,4.0,,"A pleasant stroll and oddly new compared to other temples I've seen in Asia. Everything was so shiny, clean and bright!"
,,Great visit,4.0,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is great part of Singapore and it let us know more about Buddha. Enjoy trips and tours in Singapore.
,,Peace and Luxurious Temple,5.0,,"After browse in China town, we visit this temple, the architecture design is religious but modern, mostly red and green, when you enter the temple, glorious of gold will amaze you, speechless with the temple interior, detail and walls filled with Buddha statue, you can feel the peace in the place."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We came across this temple while walking around Chinatown this temple is very impressive, and worth having alook at, the children could believe the size of the statues inside that are worshipped and gives them an eye opener on the different cultures. If you happen to have short sleeves or no sleeves they do supply you with a sarong you can cover your shoulders with and it's no charge (as I had to put one on) but walking in is well worth it and is well worth the look, this place is just beautiful inside."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Seen many Buddhist temples on this trip around south east Asia but they never get boring. This is a good one to visit, easy to locate in Chinatown right next door to the china town visitors centre & a good market for souvenirs. A ceremony was taking place during our visit but they were happy for us to watch which was great"
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,5.0,,"A Beautiful Beautiful Temple, with many locals stopping to light incense sticks and offer prayers. You may enter wearing shoes and the art work and numerous statues of the gods are just amazing to view. Well worth a visit."
,,"Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, Singapore",4.0,,"It looks old, being built in the style of the Tang dynasty buildings, but was only opened in 2007.

Where; Chinatown, Singapore(right next to the markets).

What's so special? Its claim to fame is that the temple houses a tooth belonging to Buddha).The tooth is housed in a display cabinet made from 320kg of gold donated by devotees.

What to see; Buddhist Culture Museum, Eminent Sangha Museum, Tripitaka Chamber, and a Theatre for cultural performances. There are also talks and films.

When; Pretty much all the museum and Tooth Viewing opportunities are daily from 9am - 6pm but there's plenty of activity from 4.30 a.m. with morning chanting etc.

The feel; inside this venue it is amazing how peaceful this place is when you walk outside the gate into the hubbub of modern day Singapore.

Well worth a visit to experience the sinple lives of the monks in one of the great financial hubs on the planet."
,,Beautiful temple with good museum,4.0,,The temple itself is beautiful and worth walking through. There didn't seem to be any restrictions on taking photos even during religious services. Upstairs on the 3rd floor there is a museum of Buddhism that explains the life and teachings of Buddha in a very accessible way in addition to displays of Buddhist art and artifacts from all over. The Buddha tooth relic is on the 4th floor in a special room with over the top gilt decor where photos can't be taken.
,,Must see,5.0,,This along with the many other amazing temples in Singapore is a must see while visiting. Amazing relics & sculptures.
,,Visit if you have nothing better to do,3.0,,"This is unimpressive, there are crowds even during the weekdays, and the place is filled with incense, you can feel it even before stepping into the temple, the staff down there are rude and cannot control the crowd, forget it, unless you have nothing better to do. I would not visit this place again."
,,Come and pray,4.0,,"The temple is great, I came here just one day before Vesak Day and it's really crowded. It has a soothing religic atmosphere and it has museums and a garden on the top floor.

After praying, you can stroll around the market at the back of the temple. There, you can find so many food stalls and souvenir shops."
,,Superb temple,4.0,,"If you want to visit only one temple in Singapore, this should be it. The temple holds a very precious relic of buddha and is very beautiful. The museum gives you an apprehensive overview of the life and teachings of Buddha. The museum shows the different styles of sculptures of buddhism throughout Asia."
,,One chinese temple that has survived in China Town,5.0,,"Interesting Chinese style temple at the side of China Town and amongst many modern buildings, quite surreal."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The sheer quantity of identical Buddha statues is astounding. There must be thousands of them. I appreciated the fact that although this is very much a working temple, tourists were encouraged to explore and to take photos."
,,Serene Place,5.0,,"Its a must visit Temple. Do not miss the wonderful experience. Though its a place of worship, and the prayer are on. Visitors are allowed to go around & take picture and learn about the temple and the culture."
,,very interesting and peaceful!,4.0,,"The roof garden was a real place for solitude! The museum is a wonderful building, full of colour and the sounds of silence and Chinese lanterns swinging in the wind really enhanced the visit. You would not have known you were in a city as busy as Singapore. It was clean and reverent, with very helpful assistants."
,,So much I don't know about Buddhism,4.0,,"But this busy temple (full of tourists and those attending a service) tries to educate as well as celebrate and worship. We were not expecting to visit a temple so were inappropriately dressed - no problem as there were lots of shawls on offer to cover our bare shoulders. Fascinating place over many levels - don't miss the enormous prayer wheel, or the peaceful roof garden with 10,000 (or more) tiny Bhuddas. So much gold! Left feeling slightly less ignorant, and strangely peaceful"
,,Free temple visit,4.0,,Being Very colourful made everything look new. lots of people using the temple not just tourists a real surprise.
,,Certainly worth a visit,4.0,,"Initially I was slightly underwhelmed by the temple - thought it a tad ""office block"" from a distance, but this is a real mistake to make.

The temple is a ""working"" temple - when we visited there was a service going on - devotees chanting in a large open area on the ground floor - yet they were very happy for visitors to file past and even take photographs. In fact the Temple staff are very welcoming and happy for photographs of everything for no fee.

The inside of the temple is very colorful, brimming with Buddha statues and other related religious insignia. Although it does have the feel of many such working temples in the likes of Lao, Japan, Sri Lanka etc it still looks and feels very new which I was not used to for a Buddhist temple - one usually admire the history and feel the sense of timelessness in these places yet this temple really felt new - which naturally it is (Just a personal thing - like old time worn temples !).

All in all it's certainly wort making the effort to get here and have a look round - quite inspiring !"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"I have now been to Singapore 7 times and I visit thus temple every time. There is always something different to see, with religious ceremonies happening all the time. There are several levels with some wonderful religious relics to see. The walls are covered in small little cupboard things where people's ashes are kept."
,,Buddhist temple in full colour,4.0,,"Upon entering this temple you are confronted with hundreds of Buddhas small and large, colourful lanterns hanging from the ceilings, ornate statues and colour, colour everywhere. This temple is used daily by worshippers and they are welcoming to tourists . A few people were turned away because of totally inappropriate dress. please be sensible no singlets for men, no revealing outfits for ladies and have your shoulders covered and be respectful . A very simple thing to do when travelling in Asia is to take a shawl in your bag ladies and you will never have a problem anywhere. Where more than a shawl is required you will be offered outfits, Photography is allowed."
,,The relic is too small and far away to see,4.0,,The real gem is the garden on top of the building. The largest enamel prayer wheel is up there too - it's a wonder to behold. You hold a brass rail and walk it around . . . the garden is beautiful.
,,Fascinating.,4.0,,"This was my first visit to a Buddhist temple and it was fascinating. Part museum/part practicing temple, there is so much to see. We had just been to Notre Dame in Paris and I had a similar sort of discomfort about being a tourist in a place of worship - but they were very welcoming, politely offering a shawl to my friend (with bare shoulders) and answering questions about photography. I guess like another reviewer has said, it is not really the right place for a religious experience - perhaps more an educational one. In saying that though, while we walked around there were monks preparing offerings, and upstairs in the garden there is a prayer drum which people were using. Overall, very interesting and such a neat contrast to the religious sites we had been to in Paris.Would recommend a visit if you are in Chinatown."
,,Very Modern Temple,5.0,,"A temple with an actual elevator.
A lot of gold had been invested in this temple.
Allowed to take pictures.
I was lucky to be able to see a service. Many locals visit it, many people take part in the service.
Very warm and clean temple.
Extreme amount of flowers, golden figures, and shiny objects.
People who work there are peaceful, and do not mind tourist, who film them.
Easy to find.
Their service is very interesting to watch. It was around 18 pm."
,,Touristy,3.0,,"Feels more like a lecture hall than a temple. If you really want a religious experience, this is probably not for you"
,,Serene and spectacular,5.0,,Beautiful and very serene! Worth a visit if you go to Chinatown! The architecture is just breathtaking and the statues are so beautiful!
,,4 Floors of Buddha History,5.0,,"Starting at the top open air floor where there is a 10,000 buddha memorial and very large prayer wheels, you work your way down to the actual Buddha Tooth Relic room with monks who will answer any questions you may have about it. Then down to the library for those who would like to study more about the subject of Buddhism. Then down to the Museum with a beautiful selection of statues and art from the past. The ground floor is a Buddhist temple with plenty of space to take pictures or just to light your joss sticks and say a prayer no matter what your religious denomination might be."
,,Colourful and crowded,4.0,,"We went there on a holiday. The huge Buddha statue was overwhelming. The monks were sitting together in rows and chanting. It was a good experience to listen to the chants.
There are a lot of small Buddha statues embedded on the walls of the temple. They look spectacular in the bright lights. There is a museum and roof garden on the floors above. The famous Buddha tooth is also displayed in one of the floors. The statues of monks and saints are also very well displayed."
,,In the heart of Chinatown,4.0,,Easy to miss but we were lucky on this our second visit to hear and see a ceremony with chanting monks Photography allowed inside enough said At the side of the Temple is an entrance to go downstairs where you can eat inexpensive vegetarian food
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"Like many temples in tourist areas, you will not find this a peaceful place. A bit of hustle and bustle going on inside with people shuffling through for a look. Interesting to see though!"
,,Worthy of a visit,4.0,,"New temple, very welcoming, great architecture. The 100 Buddha statues are impressive, photos are welcomed but not of people praying or meditating which is only polite."
,,Fulfilling experience.,5.0,,I'm Singaporean and this is my first time that I have visited the temple. Lots of Buddha and buddha relics. A peaceful place.
,,Worth a visit in China Town,3.0,,"Although there is not too much to do here, it is still a place worth visiting. The temple is really big, and exploring the streets of China Town on your way there makes it something to add to your to-do list."
,,impressive,4.0,,"there is no fee to go into the temple they only ask that you cover shoulders and knees, it's a working temple so I got to see the monks and others praying and chanting which softens the soul. The building is ornate and the attention to detail is incredible there are mini buddhas which line the walls of the ground floor. Definitely worth a visit when in China Town."
,,SG temple withs Japanese smells !,5.0,,"Building of temple make me feeel so japanese ! I never visit japan but this make me feel right that ! Temple is beautiful for internal and external , Huge Hall, This is one of the most beautiful temple I ever seen. Pray for Luck!"
,,Beautiful Buddhist temple,4.0,,"A beautiful example and comparable with many of the Buddhist temples in Bankok. Very well kept and beautiful examples of the art and artefacts for the Buddhist faith, interior especially spectacular with the wall cavities packed with hundreds of buddha statues. Worth the look while you're in Chinatown, and you won't need to spend a huge amount of time here. Free entry (you can make a donation)."
,,very cool,4.0,,"it's a spiritual place, but visitors may take photos of any/all Buddah statues. They were preparing for the annual Moon cake festival."
,,More like a museum,3.0,,"We were hoping to have a traditional monk blessing yesterday. The monks were chanting and not available. Staff quiet abrupt. Bracelets expensive. 28AUD you can buy in Chinatown for 2AUD. Roof top is lovely. Very impressive building. Enjoyed reading about the people on the 1st floor. Take the stairs when busy, faster than the lifts. It would be so much better if you could have a guide to explain things to you, instead of shuffling through."
,,Magical,5.0,,Have visited similar in Sri Lanka and this is far more superior. Amazing sight with magical decor. And free entry. A must see. A tranquil haven in a fast paced city.
,,"Beautiful, Opulent Temple - A 'Must See' in Singapore's Chinatown",5.0,,"This is the most spectacular Buddist temple I have ever seen. The exterior appearance does not do justice to the opulence of the interior. There are 4 levels and a rooftop area with an outdoor garden & a huge ornate cloisonne prayer wheel that would be several metres tall.

The level that houses the Budda Tooth relic is extremely ornate with lots of gilding and there are no photographs permitted on this level. Please remember that this is a temple and when we visited there were several worshipers at the temple.

This is a truly peaceful place and well worth a visit. Entry is free but you can make a donation. The Temple and Chinatown are easily accessed by public transport, taxis or the Hop on/ Hop off buses that run frequently."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Free to enter, first floor had a hall for worshipers, while the upper floors housed a restaurant, museum and a viewing gallery of the Buddha Relic which was beyond opulent with gold hued tiles and jewel-toned walls. Quiet and very nice atmosphere despite the tourists milling about. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This is a must for those visiting Chinatown. The multi-storeyed temple contains a wealth of information and religious artefacts with the tooth relic enshrined on the top floor. The roof contains a beautiful and peaceful orchid garden.
,,Great,5.0,,"Loved this, no admission charge but can donate. Was on several floors but had lift and was well worth a visit"
,,Very opulent,4.0,,"We visited this temple as we came across it whilst wandering around Chinatown. It's free to enter and was quite fascinating. It is over the top opulent and apparently houses 10 000 buddhas, most small, but rather larger and ornate ones as well. We didn't stay long, but would recommend a visit here if you're in the area."
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"I had not been inside a Buddhist temple before so this was all new to me. It is surprising to learn that the building is only a few years old as it looks as if it has been there for ages. Lovely atmosphere, even with all of us tourists wandering about, and beautiful colours everywhere. Well worth a visit when in this fascinating area."
,,Buddha's Tooth,5.0,,"Not sure about the relic, but the temple is well worth a visit as it is a very ornate and interesting sight, and since it is right in the middle of Singapore it is easy to get to. Just remember, as well as being interesting to tourists, it is very holy to believers. So don't show up your home country by going in there in a state of undress, talking loudly on your phone et cetera. If you want to do such things, go worship at McDonald's, they won't judge you."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,"When in Chinatown do pop into this temple. It is really stunning and very interesting, especially the museum on the 1st floor. No entrance fee and you are also allowed to take photos. No need to take off your shoes."
,,The best buddhist temple in Singapore,4.0,,"There are other monasteries and relics, but this is one has the most life and just visually is in a league of its own. Definitely worth a visit when in Chinatown."
,,Holy place with a taste of modernization,4.0,,"Well-organized temple and museum with nice Chinese decorations. The building is modern with clean elevators, halls and toilets.
There are sections in which taking photographs is allowed (without flash). There are also sections which photography is strictly prohibited. So you should check the signs often.
The place is free to visit. They also offer free books about Buddhism which you can take along with you."
,,A must see!,5.0,,We love this temple and so do every visitor we have brout here. The detail and architecture is beautiful. Definitely recommend this.
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Quite impressive temple with a lot to see - not just the Buddha tooth relic, but also the other rooms with the Buddhist guardians/protectors of the different Chinese star signs, the great temple.

They have a spare-clothes box if you turn up without your legs/shoulders covered, which is very considerate (unlike some religions that just turn you away with a look of disgust!)."
,,Interesting Place,4.0,,"For a non-Buddhist like me, I still enjoy walking around the temple as they have different displays from the rooftop garden, to the museum and to see all the relics. Its also very pretty in picture from the outside."
,,A Top-Two Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"There are definitely two places to visit in Singapore, and The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum (BTRTM) is one of them. As far as my husband and I am concerned, this is the top cultural site to see in Singapore. It is hard to believe this beautiful temple is a mere 11 years old. According to the temple’s Deputy Executive Director, Ee Tiang Hwee, it took years of planning and fundraising to build this impressive structure. The temple is based on the Tang dynasty architectural style and built to house the tooth relic of the historical Buddha, which is claimed that was found in 1980 in a collapsed stupa (a mound-like or semi-hemispherical structure containing Buddhist relics) in Myanmar.
The grand temple is richly ornate and colorful, but not over the top. The exterior screams for photos to be taken. As a matter of fact, the original designs were a lot more elaborate. Without a doubt, the most significant feature of the temple is the two-meter tall solid, pure gold stupa that weighs 420 kg / 925 pounds. It is located on the fourth floor, in the Sacred Light Hall. One can access the room via stairs or an elevator. Only the temple’s monks have access to the inner chamber, however visitors are able to observe it from the viewing gallery at three different times during the day.
This is more than just a temple as BTRTM houses a library and a museum. Unfortunately, when we visited it, the library was undergoing renovations as they are trying to improve the ambience of the library for its patrons. The museum is fantastically enlightening. It gives one a good understanding of Buddhism, especially for visitors from North America and Europe, who are not surrounded by Buddhist temples. Inside the museum are some invaluable Buddhist artifacts that BTRTM has been collecting. It is quite impressive to see them close up. None of the other temples we visited in Malaysia and Thailand had as an impressive collection of Buddhist relics.
On the roof is a surprise for many, but probably not for residents of Singapore. A very peaceful, tranquil gardens covers the top of BTRTM. It was a great place to escape the concrete jungle for a few minutes. At one end of the roof top gardens is a prayer wheel. The prayer wheels are used by the followers of Buddhism to accumulate wisdom and merit (good karma) and to purify negativities (bad karma).
Like any other religious site in Southeast Asia, dressing appropriately is mandatory. Ladies will be asked to cover up if they are wearing short shorts (knee-length is okay) or a sleeveless top. Wraps are provided free of charge if you are deemed to not be wearing the correct clothing.
If you want to understand something about Buddhism and to see a beautiful religious site, put The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum at the top of your list of things to do. This Chinatown temple is a place even kids will enjoy. It will be an unforgettable experience for you. Afterwards, go across the street to get some excellent street food at the world famous Maxwell Road Hawker Centre (Gordon Ramsey was just here)."
,,Temple worth seeing,5.0,,"You will see a lot of temples, but this one is one that stands out. It's in the heart of Chinatown, very easy to find. You will need to cover your shoulders and knees to enter!"
,,Its nice,3.0,,"Its a buddha temple. Same as what you see in Dharamshala. If you have already seen buddha temples, you can skip this. China market next to this also makes you feel you are part of tibetan market in mc leodganj"
,,great,5.0,,"fantastic place to understand the Buddha culture of chinese in Singapore, every floor is about a different experience that helps people to get more knowledge on this religion. Relic room is great for meditation"
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,Were taken through this temple by a local whilst wandering through Chinatown. An absolutely lovely place but very crowded on a Sunday morning. Taken by the fact that although its quite new there is a feeling of reverence and worship and the workmanship is quite outstanding. Well worth a visit.
,,A must stop for every tourist and local alike,5.0,,"One of my favourite places in Singapore. Even though this is a new temple it has a great feel. The best times are mornings, around 10 am, when the monks are chanting. Beautiful buddhas, wall hangings, colours. The place makes one feel better. If you need a snack, across the road a bit up the road is a very traditional and original bake house, serving the best egg custard tarts in town."
,,"10,000 buddhas and me!",4.0,,"Beautiful place, but I have to say I'm with the people who say it's over-exploited. You feel like an unwelcome intruder as the monks pray...it's too commercial and open."
,,Serenity ...at its peak,4.0,,Beautiful temple..serenity was in each and every corner. Must visit the roof garden which is a world of its own
,,Would recommend,4.0,,Beautiful temple near China Town and definitely worth a visit! Very impressive building and very peaceful! I was unfortunately not appropriately dressed in a small skirt but the staff kindly provide skirt wraps which was much appreciated!
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"This is a great temple to visit. There are a number of temples to visit in Singapore but if you have to visit one, this is the one to visit."
,,Try to visit during one of their chants,5.0,,"We just happened to stumble upon the temple (around 1pm) during our visit to Chinatown. At that time, in their main hall on the ground floor, some 100 people were chanting led by a monk. Apparently it was to be a 5hr chanting session. Have experienced nothing like that before. The Budha's tooth is housed on 4th floor and on 5th floor they have a roof top garden and a giant bell which you are supposed to turn for your wish to come true."
,,Festival of the Hungry Ghosts,5.0,,"We were expecting a nice tour of this famous temple created in the 1990s but we were unable to explore too deeply. Disappointed? Absolutely not! We stumbled across a beautiful ceremony full of singing, gestures and offerings. Being able to see such a stunning place of worship actually in use was an amazing experience. How lucky am I!"
,,If you have time and religious.,3.0,,"I didn't know anything about the temple. I just want to go to Maxwell market for food. But on the way I saw Chinese temple which I have to walk passed by, so I decided to spent time to explore before lunch. The temple situated on the main street near China town and just a couple of steps aways from Hindu temple. While walking on the ground floor, I've heard from people walking around that the Buddha relic is on the top floor, otherwise I would left the temple without notice. It's good though."
,,Much better than the Hindu Temple!,5.0,,"We had planned to go only to the Hindu temple, but I realized this was almost right next to it. I convinced my husband to go. He was NOT so excited about it. However, we spent almost an hour there (with our two little kids! One and three years old!). They gave me a wrap to put around my legs and shoulders since I had shorts and a sleeveless top, but I didn't feel awkward, as half the women in there were wearing those wraps. The museum was so interesting! We were two people who on the spur-of-the-moment decided to go to the museum, but the sights, the relics, and the information given were all really interesting! Both me and my husband were happy we went!
The elevators go up to the fourth floor to a beautiful room where Buddha's tooth is. From there, you can park your stroller and walk up to the roof where a small but beautiful and breezy garden is located. We sat up there and the kids enjoyed a snack.
When we came back down, a group of people were doing their chants. Again, this was so interesting to watch.
There were a lot of people, but it wasn't too crowded. It was a challenge keeping my kids hushed in the meditation areas, but it was definitely worth the challenge!
After this temple, we went straight to the Hindu temple. We spent about three minutes inside there and left. It was nothing compared to this Buddhist temple!"
,,Very Serene Very Colourful,4.0,,"Your mind really calms down when you are here. It is such a peaceful place - like a sanctuary. it is a very colourful place with all the statues and the decorations. if one has not seen a typical chinese / buddhist temple then this is a must visit. it is in chinatown which is there on the itinerary of all tourists. it is also a photographer's delight. please do however, keep in mind that this is a practising place of worship - so your demeanour and clothing has to be appropriately respectful."
,,the Buddha Tooth Relic temple and Museum at Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"the psirituality is at its zenith when I went to the BTRTM at Chinatown.the location add to its ethnicity and the serene atmosphere is something to be experienced by self.the building itself is so very tradional architecture.there are four floors.
at the rooftop is the prayer wheel,with explanation on the boards.
the rooftop is so well maintained with a garden and flowering trees.its a pleasure to just be there.
the third floor has a museum depicting the stages in Buddha;s life.with lovely stone statues.there's one of the Buddha being crowned also.
the main temple is on the ground floor,so huge with towering stautes of the Lord.on the walls are adorning statues of the Buddha in various forms.I can just keep on writing and writing,but please do go and see the temple.so much of discipline,cleanliness and an aura it what makes me long to go there again and again.
the documentation of the statues is immense.no need of a tourist guide at all.everything is self explanatory.Serenity thy name is the BTRTM at Chinatown.
the website on google is also so good with the actual chanting being heard."
,,Pleasant surprise...,4.0,,"We stumbled in to this Temple/Museum as we were wandering. What a pleasant surprise! A fellow was at the entrance handing out sarongs, so as to cover prior to entry. We happened in during a chanting session, and were fascinated by the monks monotonous practice. Gorgeous gardens. 10,000 budhas on the property. Enormous prayer wheel."
,,A gem,4.0,,Decided to visit purely as it was marked on the map and we were walking around ( not quite aimlessly). Welcoming and well worth spending time visiting all levels and read the story or the origins of the beliefs.
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"Go early as possible, do the full tour, take the elevator up and visit all the floors, brilliant interesting place, fantastic rich colours and if you go when the chanting and praying, if that ois what it is, is takign place it adds another dimension one of the great experiences for those with open minds"
,,Must see when visiting Chinatown!,4.0,,"This is a beautiful and interesting temple. I had been to Chinatown many times but had never been in the temple and was so happy that I finally did! Dress appropriately, ladies will be asked to cover up if wearing short shorts or a sleeveless top; wraps are provided. Very photo friendly."
,,An interesting experience.,4.0,,"Happen to come across while strolling around chinatown with my parents. A nice 4-storey air-conditioned Buddhist temple. There are 2 lifts which goes up to the 4th floor. There is a stairway that leads to the roof where there is a nice small garden with orchids. Very peaceful. It is definitely worth taking a look around if you are nearby. Each floor has its own attraction.
Shawls are provided for tourists wearing shorts/ short skirts/ sleeveless."
,,Surprising find,5.0,,"I never really bothered about this temple until I stepped in one day - I was surprised to find the place so pretty and ornately done up! The buddhas which line the wall have different expressions, and it was quite interesting observing everyone of them. It's very photo-friendly as well, and there is a museum describing the life of Buddha on one of the floors. Ladies be warned - no sleeveless or shorts allowed on the premises. Otherwise, cover up with one of the shawls provided FOC."
,,Lovely Cultural Experience,5.0,,Such a serene place. Loved watching the chanting and reading about the bodhissatva for the year I was born.
,,Overrated,4.0,,"We made the trip out to Chinatown to visit the Buddha tooth relic. A word of caution to the ladies- you need to be covered before you're allowed to enter the temple. If you're in a sleeveless top or shorts or a skirt, they will ask you to wrap up in a shawl.

The temple is big and is four storeys high. The tooth is kept locked up in an inner sanctum and you can only view it via a webcam. It was quite disappointing.

There is a museum somewhere on the 2nd or 3rd floor which provides an interesting overview of the Buddhism faith."
,,"Beautiful haven, welcoming by sound and smells",4.0,,"Beautiful, ornate and colourful building, wafts of inscence and chants. The kids and I arrived a 2 pm just as the monks were chanting. Very welcoming making suggestions of behaviour, dress code etc. Most of the shrines had explanations, but I still felt very ignorant as to what exactly was going on. One for google when we got home."
,,"Colour, colour and more colour!",4.0,,"Arriving in a downpour one of the first things I noticed was the intricate roof line and the colourful flags hanging from the Temple. Stepping inside; the riot of colour, it didn't matter where I looked something else caught my eye, the ceiling, the walls, the silk paintings, the 100 Buddhas (each of them different). The main altar (I'm sorry if this isn't the right word) just glows. Even with the amount of colour it's such a tranquil place.
It's an active temple where worshipers come with their offerings and go about their business even when tourists are wandering about. Thank you for sharing your temple with us.
A reminder that dress codes exist, please dress modestly, no minis, short shorts (knee length is OK), sleeveless tops or backless outfits. Although the temple does have sarongs and shawls you can borrow to cover up."
,,Very rich place (in all means),5.0,,"I saw in the past some temples in Singapore but none was like this. full of activities, real nice. very rich and amazing. I recomend as one must when you are in Singapores chinatown."
,,Nice cultural visit,5.0,,"Beautifull place to visit, must do if you are in chinatown area Temple is wonderfull. Go there by taxi as car park is a nightmare But i forgive because th rest is beautifill"
,,One of the best things we saw in Singapore!,5.0,,"This place wasn't even in our guidebook or on the tourist map, but it was fantastic. The inside of the temple is intricately decorated and the museum upstairs is also wonderful. We spent a few hours here just walking around. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,What an interesting place filled with beauty and culture. Felt peaceful just visiting the temple. Take water to stay hydrated as it can get hot in there.
,,Check this out!,4.0,,This place is in Chinatown across from Maxwell Hawker Centre. It's very nice with it East Asian architecture. Ladies remember to bring something to cover your shoulder and thigh if you wearing tank top and short or skirt. The temple will let you borrow a scarf if you don't have one. There's public bathroom if you need to use it and there's tons of good places to eat nearby.
,,Don't miss the 4th floor where the relic is!,5.0,,"It is a beatiful temple, we were lucky and saw the morning prayers. All gold decorated and with hundreds of buddhas. The main buddha is huge and nice ornamented. The Relic is on the 4th floor within a chapel and it is beatiful as well."
,,Beautiful look into Buddhism - but needs more info on exhibits,4.0,,"This multi-story attraction if gorgeous from the inside and out. Filled with decorative details, it isn't just a museum but you can experience the monks and faithful praying fervently - what an experience! There's an informative exhibit on the story of Buddhism for those curious and all around the building there are beautiful sculptures and altars. Be sure to visit the roof garden as that was such a pleasant surprise of a respite. My only negative comment is that there are not enough descriptions or information on the sculptures around the building. I left wondering that a lot of things were... such a pity. And those that did have descriptions (like that at the tooth relic) were in a bad state. The booklet was terribly kept with torn pages and damaged corners."
,,Modern clean temple,4.0,,"If you visit Chinatown, it is well worth popping into the BTRTM and either a short or a longer visit. It is free to enter and to visit all the floors. One of the floors has a display that tells simply about the life of Buddha for the non-buddist. It is also possible to see multiple relics which look like round polished gemstones. Visit the roof for a lovely roof top garden and massive prayer wheel."
,,Peace & Calm in a busy city,5.0,,"Went to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & it was quite spiritual. As a person trying to learn the Buddhist ways I didn't take any pictures inside & please take your shoes of when you go inside. The lower floor is dedicated to praying & offerings to Lord Buddha. Up on the forth floor is the Tooth Relic & is housed magnificently. There is a monk there & with an offering you will receive a blessing, which I did. In the roof top garden there is a large prayer wheel to turn. Great place to visit whether you are into Buddhism or not. ."
,,A beautiful temple in the heart of Chinatown,5.0,,This is an absolutely beautiful temple and a very important part of the Chinatown community. When I visited they were in the middle of prayers/puma and it was beautiful to watch. You can also go upstairs in the temple to view more parts of it. It is absolutely massive and is just beautiful inside. Very peaceful and serene. A good way to spend an hour or so in Chinatown and an experience that you really should Make the time to enjoy
,,Below expectations..,2.0,,"At first, I thought this place will give more informations to me.
Some people welcomed my family & me. I wore short pants at the moment, so i should wear something that cover my leg. (the jacket, and sleeves are provided).
Everybody seemed so quiet entering the temple.
Once i get there, I enter all the floors which is opened for public.
Not much I saw there. I even can't see the ""tooth"", so far away from sight.. But else, there's more to definition of goddess..."
,,a great Buddha museum!,4.0,,"The place is really quite, and live view to see the monk and all activity, you free to take photography inside the museum but not for the relic."
,,Very decorative Temple,4.0,,Nice and close to Chinatown so you can combine the two visits. Its very ornate and beautiful. No photos are allowed up in the top floors where the relics are. You can light an incense stick and say a wee prayer while you're there too.
,,Vibrant,4.0,,"The temple is really a full auditory and visual experience when you go at the right time. No bare shoulders or legs; don't be put off, though. They'll give you something to wrap around you."
,,In China Town? Really?,4.0,,"China Town Singapore-arguably the cleanest China Town in the world is appropriately noisy, busy, festooned with shops catering to the ""Tourist Trade""- the food street, the shopping street- but just at the periphery, is this lovely little gem.
It is bright, cheerful, respectful, interesting with many levels to experience, a little garden right at the roof to sit and enjoy peace, as well as orchids in their splendour.
It is well worth the visit and very camera friendly!"
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.,4.0,,"Intriguing glimpse inside a Chines-Buddhist temple. For the adventurous, try taking the tube of sticks, shake them and have your fortune read by the stick that you chose.
It's always full so try a not so busy period like early in the morning or a weekday."
,,Amazing Buddha,4.0,,"Red gold , small, big, giant, ... one Buddha for everybody ! Within this temple you can fell how much power and aura Buddha can have one his people- to be seen as a Christ."
,,intriguing,4.0,,"A beautiful temple with impressively detailed decor. A very spiritual and moving place, definitely worth a visit."
,,Really impressive decor.,5.0,,"I've been here many times and always impressed with the attention to detail. The rooftop is equally impressive, with a huge bell in the middle of the courtyard and there is a floor which is really quiet and allows one to relax and meditate."
,,INteresting,5.0,,"I like seeing the inside of this beautiful temple. There were monks praying during the day. They provided shawls and skirt wraps for those who have their their shoulders & legs exposed, interesting.
The praying drum was pretty neat too. I loved the orchids as well ."
,,Nice to see,3.0,,"Amazing wealth in this temple. It was astounding to see all the gold. Very impressed that photos were allowed to be taken in the majority of areas, excluding where Buddha's tooth and other body parts. Plenty wraps available to make sure shoulders and knees were covered, so no-one need miss out."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This is in China town and was worth a visit .The temple is suppose to hold the relic of the Buddha tooth .There is a lot of gold and it is very or ante inside .When we were there the monks were reciting holy verses .good loo stop too !
,,spiritual experience,4.0,,"The temple was an unforgettable experience. Although we missed the chanting, the whole experience was a very moving and spiritual one for both of us. Definitely worth a look around."
,,Divine Experience,5.0,,A very nice Buddhist temple. Amazed to see the interiors and god idols. The prayer chants were quite soothing. Must watch if you are in Singapore
,,Chanting Buddists,5.0,,"It was lovely to see a new temple, as they are usually old. We were lucky to be in there when the monks were chanting and praying. The richly decorated interior was just beautiful."
,,Remember to cover shoulders and knees when in temple,4.0,,I forgot and was quickly ushered back out to the courtyard and offered wraps to get decent. They were very kind about it. Located in the heart of Chinatown which is all tourist-ed up these days but still worth a gander. Don't forget to look up at the shutter windows and old architecture of the street houses. Hawker centre is meant to be still pretty good - I didn't get a chance to check it out but the guy at the shop that I got a foot spa ($20 for 20mins of fish nibbling action) at highly recommended it.
,,AWESOME,5.0,,"After spending 2 weeks in Thailand our friends insisted in taking us to this temple. Our first reaction was ""not another temple"" but this was very different. It was a Saturday and the ground floor of 5 floors was full of people and monks chanting. The sound was awesome and an electric atmosphere. My wife's dress had bare shoulders and she was given a nice shawl to cover. Photographs are permitted, but not on the floor where the Buddha's tooth is housed. The top floor has a beautiful garden with orchids. A nice photo opportunity. go for lunch in Chinatown then visit this beautiful temple, you won't be sorry."
,,Tranquil,5.0,,"A beautiful, tranquil space in the middle of Chinatown. It's splendour is an assault on the senses. Although very busy and touristic it still manages to present an air of serenity. The Tooth Relic is at the top of the temple (via lift) but is not clearly signed and therefore easy to miss. Nevertheless, well worth the effort."
,,Great chinese temple,4.0,,"one of the great chinese temple in singapore, locating at china town theres many tourist has visited there, have a statue of buddha and bodhisatva, we will known the history of the buddha, and so many u can find there, very near from MRT China town, easy to reach"
,,Lovely serene place.,4.0,,"Slap bang in the middle of Chinatown and all of its manic markets and traders. What a contrast this was once you stepped in off the street. Quite amazing the change from the outside world. When we were there, daily prayers were being chanted. Religions are not my thing at all, but I found this place and the people within worshipping very moving and thought provoking. Its on about 4 floors with the prayers being said on the ground floor. Go and immerse yourself in the floors above hopefully when there isnt loads of tourists and you get a taste of what Buddhism is all about."
,,A living monument in the heart of Chinatown,5.0,,"Highly recommend a trip to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum in Chinatown. This relatively new temple is built in Tang Dynasty style and houses what is believed to be a tooth of the Buddha. The temple has several storeys, with the ground floor containing the
100 Dragons Hall, a wooden statue of the the Maitreya Buddha as well as of the bodhisattva Kuan Yin (aka Goddess of Mercy).
The gold stupa that contains the sacred tooth is located on the fourth floor. Note that you cannot get very close to the stupa and that taking photos is not allowed in this room.
On the third level of the building there is an excellent museum that does not only showcase several very beautiful artefacts from different branches of Buddhism but also gives a solid overview of the history of Buddhism.
When I visited in June 2013, there were some renovations happening on the second and third floor so some areas e.g. the library seemed to be partly closed off. But there was already more than enough to keep me busy for at least 2 hours. If you get tired and need to regain energy, check out the basement for a simple vegetarian meal and 'eat for charity'. The temple also has a tranquil roofgarden with lots of orchids and the world's largest cloisonné prayer wheel.
The temple complex is open every day and admission is free. You are, however asked to dress respectfully before you enter the temple (no bare shoulders, shorts, mini-skirts etc ) and non-vegetarian food is not allowed."
,,Nice little Chinese temple in Chinatown,3.0,,"A short stroll from the Chinatown MRT exit will bring you to the Buddha Tooth Relic temple.The temple was very clean , and you can see many monks pray.Can go in and watch tre procession , or go upstairs to the garden.There's a wall full of little Buddhas, to admire.Shorts are considered not polite , so they will provide us sarongs to cover our legs.There's a little souvenir shop inside , that u can buy prayer articles ,or just souvenirs."
,,Ask for Bernard.,4.0,,"Bernard is a local guide who took us through the temple and explained all the different parts of the shrine and the meanings. There is a beautiful orchid garden on the roof and a huge bell to wish on. No pressure to spend, just a local doing what the locals do best -being nice."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I loved this place. I've often done a little reading about buddhism to try to understand what the religion is all about but always ended up none the wiser. This place finally told the story in a way that made sense in the 3rd floor museum. This is not just a working temple but also the main museum for the Buddhist religion in SE Asia so it is set up to cater for all cultures and does so brilliantly. I spent nearly 4.5 hours here! I really didn't notice the time passing. If you have questions you can ask any of the staff they will be happy to help, oh and try to remember to go in to the right hand door, otherwise you may find yourself following the exhibition in reverse..."
,,Fascinating and opulent,4.0,,We wandered upon this in Chinatown. It's an amazing place with vast rooms and thousands of Buddhas. There's a garden on the roof and exhibits on each floor
,,Fascinating,5.0,,This place located in Chinatown is not to be missed. Tourists are welcomed. It is a real contrast compared to Chinatown itself.
,,Almost too much!,4.0,,"The ultimate in Buddhist bling, the opulence of this temple is almost overwhelming. But there is a real air of reverence, and it is truly worth seeing."
,,Super visit to a unique place,4.0,,"The Temple is right in the heart of Chinatown, a stones throw from the Hindu Temple and the shops and restaurants of Chinatown. U fortunately my visit was spoiled by a chap who had decided to tag along and who always bobbed up next to me wherever I went.
The Temple and Museum is on several floors. The first floor is where there are thousands of Bhudda statues of all sizes, I read that each is unique and different. There were a group of monks chanting at the largest statue which was good to see.
A must visit when you are here."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,"This is a beautiful temple. Amazing building! Everyone there was very nice and welcoming. There is a gift shop where I felt compelled to buy something, and unfortunately it's quite expensive. More fool me!"
,,First-time to observe a Buddhist ceremony,4.0,,"It was an amazing experience. We were right on time when we arrived at the temple. A group of monks and religious were gathered at the center of the main hall. While I was viewing the 100 Buddhas a gong sounded and the chanting began.

The temple is very accessible, which is in Chinatown, a walking distance from the MRT. There are plenty of images and it's a photographer's delight to be in this temple. Please bear in mind when you visit to cover yourself up. No sleeveless and short shorts please."
,,Lavish opulence but with spiritual respect,3.0,,"This is the most ""bling"" buddhist temple yet! Perhaps it is simply a matter of cultural difference, but for me it came as a great shock to see the teachings of buddha converted into a place that seems to entice you to give them money at every opportunity."
,,china town experience,4.0,,went back twice to chinatown and the temple was great. women have to cover up shoulders if in a singlet but they provide a scarf to do this. China town itself was great fund with lots of eateries and cheap beer. shopping good if you like market shopping
,,Impressive Temple,4.0,,"Impressive temple sharply contrasted by sky-scrappers in the surrounding area. Walking distance from Smith Street food centre, which is one of my favorite hawker centers in Singapore, where you could find great and authentic local food."
,,Very impressed,5.0,,I an very thankful for having had an opportunity to visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. The interior is so rich in color and tradition. The layout was very impressive.
,,Don't Miss This,5.0,,You can take a taxi or a bus over to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and then use this spot as a point to start walking. The Temple is very interesting in its own right but it is surrounded by small booth vendors and even more charming shops serving locals and tourists alike. I always find a few hours to wander this area and end up at the temple which is also an excellent landmark from which to navigate the city
,,Just another temple,3.0,,"Nothing special. The floor of the room housing the relic is made from gold donated by the public. The so call relive is controversial, there are reports saying that is a a cow's teeth. Had seen grander temple elsewhere. The neighborhood is more interesting with lots of good food."
,,A bit of a disappointment,1.0,,If you have seen most of the temples in beijing or HK you will not be impressed by this one. if you have the time though go for it but not one of the things I would come back and do.
,,Impressive!!!!,5.0,,"I've been to many many temples and pagodas in Vietnam and Thailand but man, this one surprised me!
I don't think it's necessary to pay and visit it's upper floor, the ground floor is already amazing.
The inside is huge! There the biggest Buddha in the middle like always and gold is not the only color like usual. It reflects others as well, pretty much the color of a peacock's tail. On the side is hundreds of little Buddha statues displayed in small pigeons' holes. It looks pretty impressive.
The temple is located on Sego street of China town, just opposite to Maxwell food center. I rose MRT, North South line,and dropped off at Chinatown station, then walked there, easy enough to find because it's huge and along a big street."
,,A Solitude Visit at a Pious Place,5.0,,"Religion knows no boundaries. Even if I am a self-professed Roman Catholic, other religions interest me. While staying very near this Temple which is one of the prominent temples in Singapore, I never missed a chance to see what’s inside the temple. The temple offers solemnity and piousness. You also get to offer donations via their gold-plated coins worth SGD10. Though you have the option to keep it as a souvenir or drop it at a designated donation box. I kept mine as a souvenir though because they say it’s a lucky charm."
,,Wonderful temple,5.0,,This temple in Chinatown is full of treasures and should not be missed. A great place to visit out of the heat and/or rain. Several levels to visit.
,,Wicked,5.0,,Loved this place the entrance is like a scene from mortal combat the game. Very lovely inside & a great place to reflect & take time out
,,worth a visit,3.0,,"Buddhist temples in Singapore and Malaysia tend to be pretty small and relatively undistinguished.
This one is better than most.
Definitely worth a visit; especially as part of a Chinatown walking tour. Make sure you visit the hall with the sacred fang upstairs. The rooftop garden is quite small but nice with a terrific prayer wheel."
,,Worth a visit along with Chinatown,4.0,,"It is located in Chinatown. Very neat, clean and colorful. Very well maintained, as is the whole of Singapore. Gives a feeling of peace. Worth a visit along with Chinatown."
,,Little China - The Chinatown,4.0,,"Situated in Chinatown, this beautiful Buddhist temple is a peaceful place to just sit and relax and indulge in some meditation if time permits. I was awestruck as I entered the large hall with huge Buddha statues and monks chanting their prayers as it was prayer time when we reached. It is a miniature hall with tiny Buddha statues adorning the walls. The Buddha prayer wheel and tooth relic on the top floors are a treat to the spirit."
,,Beautiful temple!,5.0,,"It is a very beautiful and peace place. It was praying time when we visited and it was just awesome. If you go inside, all the statues and altar were really beautiful. Worth the time:)"
,,Beautiful temple in Chinatown place,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a Buddhist temple and museum complex located in the Chinatown district of Singapore.

The temple is based on the Tang dynasty architectural style and built to house the tooth relic of the historical Buddha.

Access with MRT, station Chinatown.

The temple is a popular attraction within Chinatown. Clearly recommand to visit."
,,very peaceful place,5.0,,"This temple might look a bit crowd on ground floor but it has a hidden garden on the roof top. You can even go and sit peacefully there as not many tourists would go up.

The ground floor is amazing. I totally suggest you visit this temple if you come to Singapore."
,,The mistic pray open to people,4.0,,An interesting experience on prayer time. All the monks and people reading unissunous. A very intimate time to be there and find our mystic side
,,great experience,5.0,,if you want to experience another culture this is a great way of doing it - the roof top garden is stunning and the actual temple complex is incredible. Located in China town it is also dead easy to reach via the MRT
,,A must See visit,5.0,,"I had two quick visits before, but largely stayed on the ground floor. This time my brother and I explored all four floors. The prayer wheel and garden on the the 4th floor is quite impressive and peaceful. The entire building is majestic and must be one of the better temples that is open ot the public.

Its a very active temple and if the you are there when prayers are being said then its quite moving.

Its in the middle of Chinatown and very easy to get to."
,,A good experience,4.0,,"For those who are not familiar with the Buddhist culture, this is a good introduction into the workings of a temple. Despite its commercialisation and lack of proper tradition, its grandeur is sure to please. Worth visiting on a trip to Singapore to add some culture to your itinerary."
,,Make the effort,4.0,,The history and beauty of the Temple is quite interesting so this is a spot that should not be missed. Better to come earlier in the day (I was told) because the crowd was a little overwhelming when I visited.
,,"Not the ideal spiritual retreat ""heaven"" due to its overly touristic emphasis",2.0,,"All in all, the temple is very beautiful as seen by its use of gold in every piece of its architecture. It is grandeur and splendid. However, it is not a place where one can retreat spiritually due to its overly touristic emphasis. There are other monastery which is much more peaceful and enriching for the mind such as Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery and Fo Guan Shan Monastery. Furthermore, this monastery does not housed the more popular Buddha, rather exotic ones which are not commonly worshiped by most people such as Mi Le Buddha instead of Amituofo or Medicine Buddha. Some of the deities' statues are not part of Buddhism, rather a mix of Taoism with Buddhism, which makes it not a purely Buddhist Temple. Moreover, the Chinese Zodiac were never part of Buddhism, but they mixed it and misrepresented it with the Bodhisattva, which is misleading for any beginner Buddhist follower. I do believe this temple is built with the aim of promoting Buddhism to tourist given its touristic location in the heart of Chinatown, but the ""content"" inside is not a true reflection of Buddhism, rather more of Taoism. I am hugely disappointed with the gross misrepresentation.

For your information, there is a food court in the basement, but you would have to pay for what you order. (There are many other monasteries which give free food.) Look out for the opening hours if you wish to plan your lunch there. I think they do not cater for dinner, only lunch."
,,A place for worship,4.0,,The temple is a must-see when visiting China Town. The interior is filled with carvings of ancient deities and the most significant display is the Buddha Tooth Relic housed in a golden pagoda on the forth floor.
,,Good,4.0,,I found this very colourful and interesting. It gave me an idea about what the temple was like. I didnt go in as we were on a tight time schedule but would return to it if we go again.
,,the interior awe-inspiring,5.0,,"I've not been to a Hindu temple before but it was amazing! The outside looks lovely in traditional Chinese style and is huge, but it's the inside that's a real eye-opener. When I went the monks and other worshippers were sat around the middle and reading continuously from a big book (I presume, from their version of a bible). It was quite a hypnotic sound. We were able to walk round the outside and see lots of statues of the Buddha in different positions, and mini Buddha's surrounding the bigger ones. At the front was a brilliant gold canvas backdrop and a massive statue. I can't write a better description to do it justice, but JUST GO THERE.
Cost free. Museum available upstairs but didn't go. Wrap arounds available to borrow for free to cover legs and arms."
,,Mesmerizing and beautiful,4.0,,"Upon walking into the temple a fellow stopped us as I had shorts on, he handed me a sarong to wear and guided us throughout the temple explaining everything as he went. We were there during prayer time and it was mesmerizing hearing the chant and seeing the Buddhas.
Our 'guide' proceeded to walk us through the temple, including the roof top gardens etc. during this time continued to tell us about his jewelry factory and how he had lived in Australia and trades to businesses there. He told us we would have to see his jewelry store. We walked approx 5 blocks (which was getting tiresome for my nana) to a jewelry store, where he left us. We brought nothing and proceeded to try and find our way back to the temple!
The temple itself was fantastic, our tour guide which we can now see was more of a con artist was great at walking us around the temple but obviously has other priorities. Be aware of this!"
,,worth it.,5.0,,"incredible Temple! and yes ladies no short skirts of shorts, but they have cover ups. I have sleeveless on, which is not acceptable either and they have scarves you can borrow while there."
,,Humbling view inside a Buddist temple while they were at prayer,5.0,,"Beautiful bell and garden. Worth a look inside. Ladies no shorts or sleeveless wear, but sarongs are available to use. Ability to offer prayers outside."
,,Large Tample,4.0,,"This is one of the large buddhist temples in Singapore, its worth a visit if you are visiting the Chinatown area, although it should be kept in mind that the temple closes at 6pm."
,,Chinatown in Singapore at its best,4.0,,Recommended. The temple is used by the Chinese community and its well worth visiting. The atmosphere inside is beautiful as are the Buddhas.
,,Temples,5.0,,It really amazing ! try and coincide your trip with one of the Buddhist pray time the colour and feel of this is fantastic
,,A golden wonder,5.0,,"Stumbled across this temple after visiting Chinatown. There is supposedly a Buddha tooth there but we didn't see it. The temple itself is definitely worth a visit though with statues, displays, and architectural features all dripping in gold leaf. You can combine this with a visit to the Sri Mariamman Temple just up the street. Note that if you have exposed shoulders or too short shorts, you'll have to wear a cover-up (supplied) to enter the temple."
,,Amazing Temple Near Chinatown,5.0,,"We have visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple multiple times. If you are lucky, you will wonder into the temple and witness a ceremony conducted by the monks. Stop, listen, and look!! The temple has front and back sections, so make sure to see both. If you are wearing shorts or a sleeveless top, the temple provides garments to wear while visiting."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,The garden at the top is so peaceful and tranquil. A great escape while inside the amount of gold is astoundi
,,The tooth,4.0,,Is an exceptional temple with lots of 'bling'. When we were there they were having a ceremony which was haunting with the prayer rendition. Is a spectacular site.
,,Beatifull and calm religious place,5.0,,It is situated at China town after coming out of the MRT turn you will find a Hindu temple (Mariyamman Temple) on your right pass that and walk about three minutes you will find this place. Entrance free and it is very colourfull don't miss the top floor Rooftop garden and the tooth relic. A trip to this place is really worth
,,Amazing Buddha Temple,5.0,,Extremely peaceful and divine Buddha Temple. We felt sorry for having not visited the place despite been living in Singapore for the past 3 years!! The main hall is extremely royal and divine with Maitreya Budda sitting royally on the golden throne and blessing the visitors. The meditation room is bright and little noisy as compared to such rooms in other temples. The museum is adorned with very rare items that one doesnt get to find easily. A must visit for religious enthusiasts and especially with family. The staff are very friendly and provide valuable guidance.
,,Upper floors aren't as crowded,4.0,,"The entrance and 1st floor are quite packed with people, but as I made my way up towards the top, the crowds thinned out. There was an interesting garden on top which I enjoyed. Not really a garden actually, but rather just a bunch of ivy and some concrete paths. Nevertheless, it was still nice. Some of the floors don't allow photography, I think."
,,Nice,4.0,,Visited the temple on a whim while at the end of a walk through Chinatown and glad we did. Take your time and don't leave it late as the upstairs area of the temple closes earlier than the lower area. Be sure to visit the upstairs area and then make a prayer on the way out of the temple.
,,a moving place,5.0,,This is a buddhist temple that manages to be a real place of prayer and still welcome tourists. I found it very special. Don't miss the roof garden and prayer wheel at the top.
,,What is not to like...,5.0,,"My guide book derided this temple a little and left if from their china town walk. Which is a shame as it s a really nice temple, best in Singapore so far."
,,Chinese heritage site. A must visit for cultural junkies,4.0,,The temple is one of the largest in Singapore and is very exquisiteness decorated with carvings and statues.
,,Pretty good as temples go,4.0,,"This is a huge temple, which I admit I only ducked into because it started to rain. A few monks chanting into microphones and a full house of people praying. It was atmospheric and very ornate. Nice, pop in as its adjacent to Maxwell St Hawker market."
,,Authentic experience of Buddhism in SE Asia,4.0,,"We dropped by while a service was in progress and the most enigmatic chanting filled the ceremonial hall. While not familiar with the Buddhist service, it was lively and people continued to stroll around the temple during proceedings.
The congregation seemed oblivious to the dozens of tourists wandering through and photos being taken. It was most gracious of the temple and the staff.
Women did have to cover their shoulders and there was no sitting around in the courtyard, a level of respect that visiting tourists are probably not aware of, so keep that in mind.
The interior is nothing short of opulent, and the colours and smells of incense only add to the feeling of being transported into a totally different time and place."
,,Oasis in china town,4.0,,"Tranquil place, interesting perspective of Buddhism, packed with artefacts and relics over three floors.Get there before 6 as it closes ."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"This temple gave an interesting insight into Buddhism with a variety of information boards thoughout the temple. Staff are welcoming and friendly. We were lucky enough to visit during a meet, it was quite spectacular listening to the monks chants."
,,A feast for your eyes,5.0,,"I had never been into a temple like this one, I was lucky to visit the day after a significant day of celebration, this meant that there were many people visiting adding to the appeal. There were two thousand paper lanterns hanging along the outside of the building, it looked beautiful until I went inside the temple, what a feast for the eyes, statues, offerings, colour everywhere and I only stayed on the ground floor. In saying this, there is more to explore, but I felt like an intruder as it was a special celebration time, a must see."
,,Enjoy the different cultures in Singapore,4.0,,"When you are interested in different cultures and religions, do not miss the variuos temples in Singapore. And absolutely not this one. Taking pictures is allowed. Take your time and ask for explanation."
,,Lovely chinese temple,5.0,,Vey chinese looking temple. Absolutely beautiful inside. You can wander around for a while looking at all teh different Buddha's which line all the walls. It's right in the middle of Chinatown too.
,,beautiful buddha sculpture,4.0,,Went there before vesak day to make prayers for my parents. 1st floor was crowded with tourist. But if you go upstairs there is an area with all the sculptures of different Chinese gods and buddha.. And there are written explanations about the history of the sculpture. Very educational.
,,Awesome Museum and Temple,5.0,,"Level 1 : Nice work and big statue of buddha and some many small buddha with different style and emotions. We have also given a bath to baby Buddha and it was awesome experience for me and my family. On of the must view places of Singapore.

Level 4: Beautiful, mind blowing and peaceful place, you can go inside the main place where golden buddha kept but you will get the complete view from the wall made of glass. Most of the people they use to level 1 and moves back from the attraction, might be due to lack of information hence i would request you to must see level 4. its very peaceful as well.

Level 2: Some exhibition gallery is there and it will take 10 mins only"
,,A greately revered place,4.0,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a greately revered buddhist place at the China town at Singapore. Big statues of the Buddha are placed inside and the atmosphere is absolutely religious.
,,A peaceful attraction in the middle of city,4.0,,"In my last 1 year of stay in Singapore, I have gone to Chinatown many times but was not able
be here. However last week I manage myself to be there with my roommate. Amazing! A multi
storied building in deep bright colour. We visited there on a Sunday morning. The holy mass were going on. To my most wonder, there was no restriction at all for the entry and to take photographs. Please note that you can enter all the floor. There is an Amazing museum in each floor which describes how Buddhism originate from India and how it spread to different part of the world. You can see sculptures of same deity in Chinese, Thai, Japanese versions. You are restricted to take the photographs in top most meditation floor. However you can visit and meditate in your own way. The meditation floor has many artifacts made on gold. So if you are visiting the temple. Please ensure never miss this one.
The Temple is located in middle of the city. Approx 1km, even walkable, from Clarke Quay. You can also buy souvenir from adjacent China Town Street."
,,"A must if you're Buddhist. If you're not, then go anyway.",4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum in Singapore's Chinatown is an astounding place. I never would have thought a place of worship as important as this to Buddhism is situated in this relatively new country. It was refreshing to see that a religion as old as Buddhism still has a revered place in such a modern country.

The structure itself is quite imposing, and stands tall amidst the congested area of Chinatown, just opposite Maxwell Hawker Food Centre. I liked the ground floor Buddha images area and the prayers that were going on. Though not exactly peaceful as compared to the more traditional Buddhist monasteries due to the large number of Singaporeans and tourists (like us) coursing through the building every minute, it does evoke a sense of calm just seeing the monks and devotees concentrating on the prayers. The halls on the ground floor are absolutely breathtaking, with beautiful murals and gold-laden decoration everywhere.

The top floor with the actual Buddha Tooth was similarly reverent and exquisite, but just had too many people jostling for a view of the relic. I spent only a few seconds looking and decided to escape the crowd to return downstairs.

All in all, for Buddhists I think this is a definite must-see and do for each trip to Singapore to get the required blessing for a safe and happy trip."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"It was interesting seeing a temple, a nice thing to check out while strolling the city. They had information different languages amongst English, so one could understand more of what one looked at."
,,Peace,5.0,,Nice building. Shawls are available for those wearing short. The staffs are helpful and informative. Is a peaceful place and suitable for inner peace. Just in time for the preparation for the Wesak day a week later.
,,"Beautiful, Serene & Memorable - an Oasis of Peace in the Bustling City",4.0,,"This place is at the end of Smith Street, the 3rd or 4th street adjacent to the Chinatown MRT if you exit on the Pagoda Street side. It has a lovely and large temple on the ground floor, musuems on the 3rd and 4th (or 2nd and 3rd) floors and a small roof garden on the terrace. The effect is magical if you arrive at prayer time, as it transports you to a serene world of soft chants and fragrant incense right in the centre of the Singapore's hustle-bustle. Dress as per temple regimes, or use a free shawl from the box at the entrance. They also have abundant free books and literature on living, relations, meditations and the like. No entry charges and all they seek is to keep the cameras switched off at some more venerated regions within the museum. Must see, if you are anywhere around, or, if you have some time available. Add-ons are the super shopping and eating areas all around, at Smith Street, Temple Street and Pagoda Street."
,,Nice building,3.0,,"You can visit this temple in less than one hour with free entry. On the ground floor a service was going on, which was interesting to see. Monks chanting, and surrounded with coloured buddha's. It is all very colourful. You are even allowed to take pictures. You can see the other four floors by taking the stairs or elevator. On the next floor you have a nice look on the service from above. On the second floor all explanation signs are not in English unfortunate. The tooth telic is exhibited on the third floor. Before entering you are obliged to take off your shoes. And you have to cover your shoulders and legs (they have garments which you can borrow in case you need it). The relic is hard to see but is nicely exhibited with explanation in English. On the roof you will find a garden with orchids and a small temple."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,Interesting building. While we were there a service was in progress which was quite amazing to watch and listen to.. Be warned you cannot go in without covered shoulders so shawls are available in the front entrance.
,,"A hidden gem, amidst the hustle & bustle.",5.0,,"Liked: -New building. -Good location. -Pleasing design. Tip: -There is a rooftop garden, it was featured in the press in May 2013. -Besides being a spiritual refuge for believers, it also houses Buddhist monks."
,,A Day out in Singapore,4.0,,A colorful temple on the edge of China Town and worth a visit. The giant statues in the main hall are surrounded by smaller and often more colourful ones around the side walls. A small donation is always appreciated.
,,Best Temple ever,5.0,,"So much to see - On the roof, a wonderfully tranquil garden with water features, orchids, a prayer wheel. Another floor holds an excellent museum with a wonderful array of artifacts and informative history boards. And then there is the room holding the Tooth Relic - stunning. Downstairs is the temple - we were lucky enough to watch the monks doing their thing - you can also watch from the mezzanine level. Fabulous and informative - free books on meditation and Buddhism available too!"
,,free attraction,5.0,,"free entrance.Now thats a bonus.Right in Chinatown.They have sarongs they give you on the way in.You could wander around here for easily an hour.I found the budda body parts facinating.They looked like different colored small pearls.This area was on the third floor,I Think.A must see if you are in chinatown."
,,Colourful,5.0,,"This temple was beautiful and we were fortunate enough to visit during a Buddist service. It was very welcoming and had a serene, calming atmosphere. Our taxi driver told us that around 50% of Singaporeans are Buddist so this is a must see to absorb the culture."
,,Just another temple,3.0,,"Okay if you have plenty of time, otherwise can skip this. This place is located within the Chinatown district, and it houses plenty of Buddhism statues. Some of them are quite delicate and unique.

Main attraction is the 'relic'. Well, I leave it to your judgment whether the plastic-looking beads are indeed some blood relic of Buddha. In any case, you can always view and enjoy them as beautifully arranged art displays."
,,If in Chinatown ok to see,3.0,,Out side structure was nothing exciting. The inside was very ornate and interesting to walk through. the top level where the tooth is housed reminds me of a convention center room. The tooth is behind glass and too far away to see.
,,Quiet and beautiful temple,5.0,,"I was really moved by the beauty of this temple, and the energy that could be felt there. I'm not religious in any way, but watching and listening to the monks chanting, while smelling the incense, and being surrounded with such a lovely decorated place, was definitely an experience. The plus of being able to see the room where the tooth relic is kept, all surrounded by gold in the entire place, was amazing. In a city where visits to temples are so common, this is THE temple to go to."
,,Epitome of Buddhism in Singapore,5.0,,"Even though located in the heart of the bustling Chinatown and near to Singapore's Central business district, the serenity and spirituality felt in this temple is beyond one's expectations. The ground floor has 3 big beautiful statues of Buddha surrounded by many smaller intricately decorated statues. On the 2nd floor we have a museum which shows the birth of Buddhism, its spread across Asia and the prominence it has in the present day countries. It houses several rare artifacts from India and South East Asia subcontinent. The highlight of this temple is to be found on the 4th floor which has the Tooth relic of Buddha housed in a beautiful meditation hall. The last element of surprise is the Japanese garden on the top floor where the serenity experienced is at its very best and yet one can steal views of the skyscrapers of the CBD. Definitely a must visit in Chinatown area and Singapore."
,,interesting,4.0,,"The temple and museum are located in a building that itself is worth appreciating. Its unique architecture stands out and gives you a flavour of a bye-gone era. The museum presented the history of Buddhism in a narative form, which I thought was very effective & both more logical & clear"
,,Can't miss,4.0,,"If you are visiting Chinatown you can’t miss this temple as its quite a landmark. The temple is filled with golden Buddha statues of different shapes and sizes. There are several floors, each floor housing different things. Be aware that you must be covered when entering the temple however shawls are provided."
,,WOW...Glorious!!!,4.0,,It was more than a four story building....The Buddha relics are made with details.. I witnessed a ceremony there.. and It added the glory of this place... I can't say much.. Just WOW..
,,Passed this by initially,4.0,,We initially walked past this into the lanes of China town. Only on our way back to the bus stop did we realise what the place was from our Lonely planet guide and so went in. Pretty spectacular inside with an excellent museum of Buddhist art and history on the second and third floor.
,,A must for all Buddha followers,5.0,,A very well done tribute with a slightly new twist. It was easy to access and the path to walk around is clearly defined. The temple brought me a great sense of spiritual peace and harmony.
,,A place where I would always visit everytime I go to Singapore,5.0,,"This temple is definitely a place where I would always come and come again every time I step my foot in Singapore.

On the 1st floor of the temple, you can see a ceremonial pray held in the morning.3rd floor is the special room for Buddhist history and art statues from countries like China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Myanmar, etc. 4th floor is the most interesting place where the Buddha Tooth Relic is placed in its sacred room. You could also meditate in this floor.

You could also go to the rooftop where you could spend a little time enjoying the garden."
,,Unexpectedly interesting,5.0,,"We walked by the temple's back entrance, and were not attracted. Rather, we moved straight to the stalls at Chinatown. On our way return, we passed the front entrance and had in mind just to walk in for a brief visit before we left Chinatown. Very unexpectedly, the interior ambience and decoration are very spectacular. The Buddha exhibits are very nicely crafted and keep our eye sights. It is lucky that we have not missed out this venue."
,,For all with Interest in Buddhism,5.0,,Spectacular Buddhism Temple with an excellent museum of Buddhist art and history on the second floor
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The temple was very interesting and wandering seemed to disturb no-one. The museum upstairs was well presented and gave an insight into buddhism. Both the museum and the roof garden were empty.
,,Very colourful Temple,5.0,,"Left the Husband and kids at the hotel to go shopping in the Temple street markets and came across this lovely looking Temple.
As you enter the colourful walls and statues looks amazing.
If you ladies have a sleeveless shirt on remember to take a scarf from the entry as this is required to enter.
Worth a look if you are nearby"
,,Dazzling,4.0,,"This place just dazzles! Chanting and praying with gold and red everywhere your eyes are darting from the ornate ceilings to the deities to the locals praying...fascinating even although I'm not religious.
Find your Chinese Birth year symbol and read all about it or take photos.
I found my Chinese birth year..dog/pig."
,,The jewel of Chinatown,5.0,,"Strolling from the Chinatown subway station past the rows of souvenir shops, one comes to this impressive building, the jewel of Chinatown. Luck wanted it to be, we arrived while a prayer service was in full swing with monks playing instruments, worshipers singing, and hundreds of candles lit, reflecting in the gilded walls and ceilings. Aside from the ongoing service, the beautiful temple in itself is worth a visit at any time, and is reason alone to visit Chinatown."
,,You must see,5.0,,"The temple, only a short walk from China Town MRT, is impressive. Take your time to see all there. Many tourists hurry and will not feel the spirit of this place. Go up to the 4th floor to see the golden shrine. Wait for praying time in the big hall. I have been to SG several times and will come back to this temple again and again."
,,Step Back In Time,5.0,,Unique and totally over the top temple. Lovely presence inside with so many ancient artefacts it was a delightful place in old Singapore. Make sure you get a taxi there.
,,A Temple must in Singapore,5.0,,"Take your camera, take your time and wonder the temple and surrounds. There is a second level we didn't get time to see."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Beautiful inside and out, air conditioned, interesting, great temple and museum. Best thing in Chinatown."
,,Huge Temple,4.0,,If you are visiting Chinatown you cant miss this temple as its quite a landmark. Also the markets are next to the temple so a great area to see when in Singapore.
,,"Impressive, until you realize it is only 10 years old",3.0,,"It is big, it is ostentatious, it is interesting, but it has no history. I was disappointed to find out that it is only 10 years old."
,,budha history,5.0,,"Most tours of the budha temple start at the first Museum. It provides an in-depth view of the goings-on in singapore during the king regime. As with the budha temple, make sure you have a knowledgeable guide to provide the historical context of what you are seeing. Among the more moving displays are the photographs of human.. A happy testimonial to what fellow humans can do to each other."
,,Beautiful place!,4.0,,I was staying in Chinatown and came across this temple. I was amazed by the detail and color in the place and the different stories that were behind each statue. Was a interesting place to learn and see practicing Buddhism
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"The architecture of the temple is worth appreciating. The temple is filled with golden Buddha statues of different shapes and sizes. Great place to visit and learn about Buddhism, if ever you are in Chinatown."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,We were in the Chinatown area and decided to take a look inside. This really is such a beautiful temple - each room is decorated in red with lots of gold buddha statues. Make sure you visit all the floors as it is also very educational if you want to learn about the Buddhist religion.
,,Historic and Spiritual Experience,4.0,,"The temple and museum are located in a building that itself is worth appreciating. Its unique architecture stands out and gives you a flavour of a bye-gone era. The ground floor of the temple has a prayer area, primarily for practicing buddhists. Tourists can skip this level and move directly to the 3rd and 4th floor (elevator access available). These floors hold the museum and the tooth relic. The tooth relic itself is not visible directly, since it is kept inside a small temple made of gold. The temple is cordoned off by a glass wall. One can see the temple from behind the glass wall and there are booklets kept at the side providing information about the relic and the temple in English.

There is space near the temple to sit and meditate, which many people do. The presence of the Buddha's relic should transport one to a world of peace and oneness.

Tip - Footwear is permitted in all parts of the temple except the floor having the relic itself. However, cubby holes are provided where one can remove and store footwear."
,,MEDITATIVELY PEACEFUL,5.0,,"My partner described it as a ""whiz bang temple"". It even had an elevator. The roof garden was serene. It was lovely to just sit."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Certainly worth popping in to take a look at this ornate temple if you are visiting china town,but personally I wouldn't make a special trip."
,,A different view of Singapore,4.0,,"If you want to see another Singapore (not the modern one with big building and shopping mall) take a walk to this temple.
Situated in Chinatown you can't miss it as it's a big and unique building.
Don't forget to visit inside as the decoration is worth a look."
,,"Very clean, serene and it's free!",4.0,,"Opened since 2007, it is considered as a rather new temple and houses the tooth relic of Buddha. I've been to Buddha Memorial Center {佛陀紀念館} in Taiwan that is said to a tooth relic of Buddha too and do find it interesting that quite a few exist around the world - Sri Lanka, China, Singapore, Taiwan and even Japan. I'm not a Buddhist but think it would make an exciting trip for believers to travel to all the different temples and see the relics.

The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is considered as a living monument with a design inspired by the golden age of Buddhism in China during the Tang Dynasty. The four-storey temple looks pretty grand from the outside, and the red interior architecture is simply stunning!

We only walked around on the 1st floor as we were on our way to dinner, but I'd like to go back to visit the tea house and cultural shop on the 2nd floor, the Buddhist Culture Museum on the 3rd floor {it apparently has an impressive collection of original Buddha artifacts and images from different parts of the world}, and of course, the actual tooth relic on the 4th floor.

It was an eye-opener for my daughter since it was her first time inside a Chinese temple. I'm glad we stumbled upon this place on our little family walk. Do dress conservatively i.e. no shorts or revealing tops, when you visit the temple though. If you happen to forget, they have shawls and wrap-around skirts to lend.

See my photos here: http://www.sakuraharuka.com/2012/12/bub-me-buddha-tooth-relic-temple-museum.html"
,,Take time to stop whilst in Chinatown,4.0,,"Take time whilst visiting Chinatown to make a stop at The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, this was founded in 2002 and is a Buddhist Temple and Museum not only for people to worship, but a museum for people to learn about Buddhism. The temple is open from 7.00am-7.00pm, but get there early before the tour parties start arriving. The temple is 6 storeys high with the main hall on the ground floor mainly for worship with monks chanting. The museum is located on 2/3rd floors full of buddha relics and the story of buddhism and there is a peaceful rooftop garden not to be missed. The temple highly ornate with thousands of golden Buddhas adjourning the walls, it is very impressive. It is a busy place with tourists and worshippers alike. Entrance is free although donations are welcomed. Photos are allowed but no flash photography. Please dress appropriately with legs and arms covered. There are toilets here and wheelchair access.

The closest MRT station is Chinatown, or from the city centre a taxi takes approximately 15 minutes and would be approximately $10. I would suggest combining it with a stop at the nearby Sri Mariamman hindu temple, which is total different in design and decor.

Two great temples to visit whilst in Singapore's Chinatown."
,,New and clean,4.0,,"While the name of the temple implies there's a tooth someplace, I didn't see a tooth or any sort of little box on a shrine implying the tooth was inside. Granted, almost nothing was written in English so it could have been there and I just didn't know what I was looking at. The temple requires you to cover your shoulders but they kindly provide shawls for you to borrow. The temple is a new construction and everything is squeaky clean. Beautiful shrines and statues. Free entrance. Takes about 30 mins to see."
,,Interesting and amazing,5.0,,Loved this temple. Well looked after. Very colourful and ultimately a place of prayer for people of all faiths. A lovely tranquil garden at the top of the temple nice for quite contemplation.
,,Buddha Overload!!,5.0,,"A local monk described Buddhism in Singapore as ""mixed up Buddhism."" Influenced by Theravada and Hinayana Buddhism with a little HInduism tossed in for good measure. This massive temple pays homage to the Lord Buddha with hundreds, possibly thousands of Buddha images displayed in a huge devotion hall and among the 5 floors of the building. We happened to be there during a devotion to the Maitreya Buddha (Future Buddha) and the chanting of the monks and the hundreds of devotees only made the experience more moving. If you're in I would make this a must see stop."
,,A destination for a Buddism traveler,5.0,,"If you are a Buddism and you visit Singapore, you should go to this Temple. The exterior and interior architect of the temple is really sophisticated. In addition, this temple is very special with the holy meaning. It will definitely worth your time."
,,a must see,5.0,,This was a lovely attraction to go and spend a few hours for me it was to get out of the heat but once inside I was mesmerized by the architecture and decorations that this place had to offer. There are several floors each floor housing different things. Be aware that you must be covered when entering the temple however shawls are provided. On the very top floor where the tooth relic is located shoes must be removed also be considerate to those who are praying and meditating
,,Beautiful temple & outstanding museum,5.0,,"Have not been overly impressed with Chinese temples when compared to Thai but this is an outstanding exception---it is stunning.

The museum presented the history of Buddhism in a narative form, which I thought was very effective & both more logical & clear. The ""later"" history of the non-Siddartha buddahs was fascinating & new to me, as Ihave often been confused by much of that.

The roof garden was also beautiful, and tho the library was closed for some renovations, I suspect it is an important resource for scholars.

Most of the place was free, (i think there was a small fee for the tooth section, not sure) & I spent far more time (couple of hours)than expected as it was that interesting."
,,A beautiful peaceful temple!,4.0,,On our visit to Chinatown friends took us here and it's beautiful. Go to all the floors it's very peaceful but also educational about Buddha. We went at prayer time to see the locals praying together it was lovely. The intricate decor is also worth the visit.
,,This is an excellent Buddhist Temple visit!,5.0,,"During our recent trip to Singapore we visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum (free entry) while we were in Chinatown and suggest all to add this to their list of things to do/see if they plan to spend time in this area of Singapore.

This temple reminded us of Man Fat Sze (10,000 Buddha Monastery) in Hong Kong but potentially more interesting and definitely more convenient to visit. It is built in Tang Dynasty architecture style with four levels and a rooftop, which can all visited. There are lifts that take you in between the different floors.

The ground floor prayer hall is very attractive and its outer walls are lined with 50 sitting buddha statues, each in a unique position and style along and countless other miniature buddhas. There are also various larger deity statues that are beautifully placed and all is well explained in multiple language signs found throughout.

The second floor provides an open view down into the prayer hall area, making a nice visual of the large buddha statue at the front of this room. We also liked the fourth floor Buddhism museum which offers a light and a good introduction to Buddhism and its various branches of practice as they are commonly found throughout the different areas of East, Southeast and South Asia.

On the top floor there is the Buddha Tooth relic in an elaborately decorated room with many items worth having a look at. Do note that no photography is allowed in this particular room. On the rooftop you can find a nice orchid garden as well as that is described as the largest mantra wheel in the world, similar to what you can find in the temples in Nepal and Tibet and Northern India.

Overall, visits here can be done in 20 minutes or a couple hours depending on how much time you have, how interested you are in Buddhism (if so do invest some time in the 4th floor museum) and how much you are enjoying the beauty of this place. This was a surprisingly excellent temple visit in our opinion, one we will be glad to repeat during future trips to Singapore.

Hint: Women must cover their legs below the knees and shoulders if exposed when entering the temple. This is not a problem if you are not dressed accordingly as they have sarongs you can borrow to cover yourself during your visit.

Hint: Photography is allowed throughout the temple ground and floors with the exception of the floor containing the Buddha Tooth Relic as well as a couple of holy and sacred statues on the ground floor.

Hint: Along South Bridge Road, where you find the temple, you will also easily visit the very good Sri Marimman Hindu temple as well as the Jamae Mosque which are both open to visitors."
,,It's a really interesting temple.,4.0,,"In the Chinatown district this beautiful temple is easily visible from both Sago Street that almost all of the Street Market.
The exterior facade is beautiful, the building is really nice and charming, I felt in love at first sight.
Admission is free, but above all for women is recommended to wear proper dresses for a religious place, in any case at the entrance staff will provide clothes to use during the visit.
The interior is very large and spacious, really impressive the giant statue in the center of the room and on the walls dozens cells with many statues representing different Buddhas.
The visit to the temple is more than half an hour or 40 minutes.
I think it is a very interesting spot, very charming and I highly recommend the visit through."
,,Awe,5.0,,"Loved this experience. Well worth taking time to visit here and learn/understand a bit about Buddhism (something I had sparse knowledge of). No bare legs/shoulders but sarongs are available to borrow.

No entrance fee but they do accept donations. You'll see people coming by to pray as well as all the tourists."
,,You have to visit here,5.0,,"In one word - magnificent.
We were so lucky as we were able to watch monks and their congregation chant.
This is also a terrific museum telling the Buddha story.
Definitely worth a visit and spend a hour or two before finishing on the rooftop garden - tranquility at its best."
,,"Seems very 'commercial,' but an interesting visit",4.0,,"Great architecture; peaceful rooftop garden with prayer wheel; beautiful interiors; but very commercial feel with donation boxes for incense, lamps, candles, flowers, etc. for purchase."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,A must see on your visit to China Town. Cost S$62 million and opened in 2007. No charge to get in and it was facinating listening to the monks and other buddists chanting (praying). Very colourful and recommended.
,,Impressing experience,5.0,,"A must to visit when you are in Singapore, especially if you are interested in buddhism or generally in culture. At the ground floor is a temple with ceremonies you may assist. It's possible to walk around beside (at the walls), so you don't impact the ceremony but still can watch or participate very closely. At the higher floors of the building is a wonderful museum with unique relicts of buddha. The rooftop has a little garden. A must for any culturally interested traveller."
,,Amazing temple,5.0,,"We stumbled across this temple when visiting Chinatown, it is beautiful and there is no entrance fee. It was interesting to see and hear the Buddists praying and admire the wonderful decorations. There are many floors to the temple which all should be visited especially the garden on the top floor. Worth a visit if near the area."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,It's worth a visit attraction. It's very beautiful and amazing. There are many things for admiring. It's very great both inside and outside.
,,Chinatown - Buddha tooth relic temple,5.0,,Free admission. Make sure you are covered up or use their sarongs and shawls. Amazing colours and insight to Buddhism. You are allowed to take photos and are able to watch the Buddhists read their daily prayers. Very inspiring.
,,Nice temple,5.0,,"It was a nice little temple to say your prayers as a devout Chinese. Unfortunatly it has become a tourist attraction so there is not a lot of peace and quiet inside the temple, but still it was nice to say my prayers there."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,Easy to visit as right in the centre of Chinatown - people at the entrance will give you robes to cover yourself if they think your dress is inappropriate for the temple. A wonderful feeling as you walk around - delightful and interesting.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This temple is very beautiful and right in the heart of chinatown. It's more like a museum about buddhism. Don't miss it!
,,Tranquil,4.0,,"What an amazing place! A friend took me here to see the relic and I found it fascinating! Also it was so serene up on the meditation floor that I felt completely relaxed.

I would certainly recommend people visit this place regardless of your religious inclination as it is a very interesting place indeed."
,,Spiritual Fortune,5.0,,"We visited the temple before noon, and obviously a lot of people had the same idea we had. In our case, this was a free visit.
On the ground floor there is the possibility to cover your body with long towels in case you’re not dressed in an appropriate way to visit the temple. When you enter, the Maitreya Hall is the biggest and most important in the building and literally swims in gold and red. Some monks were singing their prayers, something the impression even strengthened! Everywhere hundreds of Buddha-statues in various forms and shapes represent the fortune in this pagoda.

You can take the lift to the various floors.
There is a shop (with books, little statues, amulets, dvd’s and cd’s….) allocated on the third or fourth floor, but it is expensive. I would suggest to buy some relics around the temple in the neighborhood.
The rooftop is the most quiet part: It contains a garden with a big prayer wheel (the biggest in the world?). Take a moment to sit back and enjoy the green and leaf.

Overall, we spend more than 2 hours inside. Definitely a must for every person, religious or not!"
,,Tooth Temple is Total Tourist Trap,3.0,,"The temple is really beautiful inside. Unfortunately, everything else is aimed at taking your money. Donation slots at each of several hundred different Buddhas. Gift shop at a temple?! Please!"
,,Peaceful place in the heart of Chinatown,4.0,,Walked around Chinatown district Market area and stumble on an opening to see a nice colorful temple. Walk-in free entrance a nice place to take a short break from the long walk.
,,Interesting Temple in ChinaTown,4.0,,"A beautiful and charming place, inside there you will see a hall and everyone there is worshiping. I can feel their believe. Each floor tell a story about Buddhist and history. You can have a meditation at this temple too. It's quiet and comfortable for you. Also there is a rooftop which has a very big Buddhist style bell to pray. This is the place you can go relax and meditate your mind."
,,A wealthy temple in Chinatown!,4.0,,The Buddha Tooth at this temple has been brought over from Myanmar. The temple itself is quiet large with meditation areas on top floor. The temple is beautifully decorated and although you can't see the actual Buddha Tooth there is a screen that displays it to you. The upstairs where the Tooth is on display closes at 6 pm. Best to visit around 5 pm and then explore the night market in Chinatown.
,,Nice place to see a real relic,4.0,,"It is a buddhist temple, but within the temple houses relics of buddha's tooth. Very nice place, very colorful and the rooftop is a nice peaceful place to just go and relax."
,,Ornate,4.0,,"We briefly visited this temple on two occasions during our stay in Singapore. It is easily found adjacent to the Chinatown Visitor Centre (very helpful and friendly staff) and a fascinating ten minute walk from Chinatown MRT station (five minutes if you arrive before the stalls open and crowds arrive).

Our first visit was about 9:30am and the temple was uncrowned and peaceful. The temple staff are welcoming and visitors are freely able to use the temple toilets (good), visit all floors, take photographs etc.

There is a huge amount of golden ornamentation and it is worth visiting just in order to enjoy this spectacle even without an understanding if the Buddhist faith. We were also able to stand and watch a service of worship and experience the chanting without feeling we were intruding - always maintaining a respectful silence and attitude, of course.

On our second visit, which was later in the day, the tour groups had arrived and there was a school party visiting, so the noise and busyness detracted from the experience, so it is worth trying to arrive to arrive early."
,,Great temple,4.0,,"I like that the temple has aircond as you have walked for a long time and you need a good cond place, this is it. You get to view a lot of good buddha crafts"
,,oasis spot,5.0,,"if you like to see artifacts and buddha images, here is the place you can spend a good bit of time wandering inside the temple seeing watch buddhas on the wall."
,,Incredible temple in Chinatown,5.0,,Multi-storeyed temple is beautiful. Can't really see the tooth relic though. Behind glass and kept a few feet away. Maxwell Food Centre is across the street.
,,Best temple in town!,5.0,,"This temple was built in the style of a pagoda on several floors. The public has access to all floors, which contain rich decorations, altars and a museum. There is no entry charge and inside is air conditioned so very comfortable to look around. There are ample clean visitor toilets and ramp facilites/ lift for disabled visitors.Is located in Chinatown so close to other interesting sites."
,,21st Century Temple / Museum worth the visit.,4.0,,"We've been in many old temples. But it was great to see a 21st century one with in active use. We stumbled into a chanting service.

The museum is very good. They collect Buddha artifacts to explain the story of Buddha and philosophy. Top floor of the building offers a peaceful place and a very large prayer wheel.

Very beautiful. Best part of our Chinatown visit, and close to the Maxwell hawker food area."
,,Peace and harmony,5.0,,"...was what I felt entering. The museum is great and it was really interesting find out about Siddharta. A monk blessed me, which made me really happy. I also found out the defender of my sign (the Tiger). I found the museum 5 years ago and coming back was an enchantment (I hope that's the correct word because my English is not perfect at all...)."
,,Informative and an eye opener...,5.0,,"It's a very beautiful temple in the Chinatown, ground floor is the main place for those prayers to be done. Unfortunately, the 2nd floor was closed when I went there, 3rd floor is suitable for those who are interested to know more about the life of Buddha. This floor filled with various relic and sculpture of Buddha from all around the world and along the way, you will get to see the story and know more about Buddha. Finally fourth floor is where the tooth relic located, it's a very beautiful place for worship and definitely you will feel very peaceful inside the building. Definitely a must visit place in Singapore!! Just take the mrt to Chinatown and go out at the Exit A =)"
,,Gorgeous but small,4.0,,"A beautiful temple in Chinatown. Not only a tourist site, but also a place of worship. A bit tricky to find the Buddha tooth on the top floor, but worth the effort.
The temple was smaller than many I've been too, and thus quite crowded, so it wasn't as peaceful as I'd hoped."
,,Nice modern(renewed) buddhist temple in Singapore,4.0,,"In the middle of the Singaporean Chinatown, you can find this very nice, modern and clean buddhist temple which is supposed to keep one of Sakyamuni Buddha tooth. The temple is not so big but very nice with a lot of statues of different Buddhas and Boddhisatvas. If you are a true buddhist is a must to g, if not it is very interesting to visit a nice modern buddhist temple."
,,100 buddhas,4.0,,Well worth a visit and don't forget to go upstairs (there is a lift!) and air conditioning. They provide drinking water which is handy after a hot day of sight seeing.
,,Go for the Bling,4.0,,We just stumbled upon this place and decided to have a look. All the gold-leaf is just amazing! Didn't actually view the tooth relic on the second floor as we were satisfied with seeing the temple itself.
,,Enjoyed the experience,5.0,,This is a very nice temple with a museum on the 3rd floor. The museum gives you a good insight into the life of Buddha and has some lovely statues and quite a bit of information. This temple is in the middle of Chinatown.
,,make sure you make it to the top floor,4.0,,"I have visited on the ground floor on a number of occasions. Conveniently located in Chinatown this temple provides shawls to those who are not properly attired. There are 6 floors in total to explore. My favourite is the quiet orchid garden on the roof terrace- there is also the special bell to chime whilst praying. There are local food stalls in the basement, and a carpark."
,,Solemn.,4.0,,The temple is clean. Full of interesting things inside. The architecture is great. People are nice. Many souvenirs can buy inside the temple.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"This temple is stunning, full of gold and bright colours. Amazing detail and friendly elders to tell you the history. Recommend"
,,twice a year,4.0,,"apparently the temple is only open twice a year and we were there for one of the days. fantastic decor. but if you are not religous, dont feel obliged to donate. $20 to buy a peace candle. plus donate to upkeep, its only a few years old."
,,An encounter with Bhudda's Tooth,4.0,,"Visited the temple and museum on Chinese New Year's Eve. The downside was the sheer volume of people. The wonderful benefit was to see and get some understanding of the rites and rituals associated with the New Year.

While the temple was busy we were able to walk around freely and watch the family groups praying and leaving offerings. It was a wonderful experience. The Museum was also interesting with assorted antiquities and religious relics from around Asia. It gave a wonderful insight into an ancient and complex religion.
It is well worth a visit."
,,Peaceful Treat for the Eyes and Soul,5.0,,"Beautiful experience ! I went there with my friends just before the Chinese New Year. Although it was difficult to reach because the ChinaTown was choked with hawkers, makeshift stalls and too much of crowd, but after reaching the temple we all realized that it was worth every walking step ! The temple exteriors are usual but its the interiors that blow away the mind. The paintings, decorations and overall aura is very soothing and peaceful. I reached there in evening and a prayer session was in progress which was beautiful to listen to. A must visit place for everyone who goes to Singapore."
,,Hidden jewel,4.0,,"Behind an unassuming exterior, a stunning collection of Buddhist art, relics, and statuary on multiple floors, a tea cafe, and a roof garden. Peaceful and rewarding break from the midday crowds."
,,Tranquility in the middle of Chinatown,5.0,,"Stunning, welcoming, beautiful and really informative. This was my first visit to a Buddhist temple and I was really impressed and did not feel intimidated at all. Would thoroughly recommend."
,,Peace and Tranquility,5.0,,"This Temple has plenty to see, the largest Cloisonne Prayer wheel. The Budda's tooth, a tranquil orchid garden on top of the temple. Ideal for cooling off or quiet meditation."
,,Interesting and worth a visit,4.0,,"Visiting Chinatown was ok but what I liked the most was to see a Buddha Temple, a Hindu Temple and a Mosque on the same street. Step in another world, enjoy the colors and the smells. It's worth it. Be aware that ladies are not allowed to enter in shorts. Long skirts are provided at the entrance."
,,Visit the Third Floor First,5.0,,A must see in Chinatown. I would suggest visitng the third floor first because there is a lot of information about Budha and his teachings. It helped me appreciate the rest of the temple. Overall great cultural experience.
,,Dazzling Buddhas,4.0,,Love the colours in this building. The painting and statuary are amazing. Also the roof top garden was a tranquil space.
,,Helpful locals,4.0,,"We got off the MRT at Chinatown station and had trouble working out how to get to this temple from there. We were approached by a lovely elderly gentleman who directed us to the temple. When we arrived we looked around the ground floor which had a huge golden buddah and the walls were lined with thousands of smaller buddahs, all of which had been donated by people. We couldnt find the way up to the other floors and were just getting ready to leave when the friendly gentleman appeared again and showed us how to get up there. He took us on a guided tour all around the other floors and told us all about the history of the temple. When we were finished he refused to take any payment for helping us out and said he was retired and loved showing people the temple. We ran into another family who he had also helped out too. What a lovely local!"
,,Sublime!,5.0,,"This is a shrine combined with modernity and history. Even if you're an atheist, you'll be stunned by everything inside! Worth the visit!"
,,A modern temple with modern amenities,3.0,,"This temple is built right in the heart of Chinatown, one of the oldest sectors in Singapore. From afar, given that this a conservation area, it towers about the 2 and 3-story shophouses of the area and look s quite imposing. But actually, it is a relatively modern edifice built less than 10 years ago.

Still, the storied temple-building has traditional Chinese architecture but everything is built with mortar and steel.

The main hall where the Buddhas are placed is air-conditioned, and I must say provides a respite from the sometime overbearing humidity and heat of Singapore especially after the late morning hours till the early evening. If you are lucky, bottles of cold water are sometimes distributed free of charge.

Like most Chinese temples, removal of footwear isn't required, but people are expected not to talk too loudly, smoke inside or have children running around. Photography I believe is permitted but without use of flash.

Buddhist literature is also distributed free of charge but many of them are in Chinese.

The incense smoke may affect those with lung or breathing issues. So take precautions before entering the temple grounds.

After a visit to the temple, you can stroll in the streets of Chinatown and admire the old 19th century architecture."
,,Large Temple in Chinatown,4.0,,"Large and recently built temple with good museum and temple areas, including the roof area. We spent an hour or so going to each floor."
,,Great Vegetarian food in basement,5.0,,The temple is very ornate and multi leveled with thousands of Buddahs. A relaxing roof top garden but the best find was the vegetarian restaurant in the basement where the ladies served a wonderful daily buffet for only a few dollars.
,,Excellent visit,5.0,,"A must visit, spectacular colors, serene temple with thousands of Buddhas. No fee for taking photos,much appreciated in this town"
,,Beautiful way to start the morning,5.0,,"Took a walk into Chinatown one morning and visited the temple. Free entry. Its a beautiful place with a very serene feeling to it. there are 4 levels to explore and a beautiful garden to see on the top floor. Well worth visting. After, you can visit the chinatown markets!!"
,,Worth a look if you are nearby,3.0,,We popped in here while checking out Chinatown. Quite ornate and has an comprehensive history of Buddhism on the second floor. The relic itself is a bit difficult to see.
,,More than I expected.,5.0,,"I decided to go here one evening as it was close to my hotel, and I thought why not? I was blow away by the beauty of the place. The entire temple is adorned with what must be millions of Buddha statues (which at first appear to be wall paper but on close inspection reveal the tiny recesses with the Buddha statues). A must see if in the Chinatown area of singapore."
,,"BIG temple, very flashy",4.0,,"It's probably the flashiest temple I've ever been to, and I've been to many. Everything is gold and red and all kinds of colors, even the rooftop garden with the giant bell was flashy (if gardens can be described as flashy). I took a Japanese visitor there and she was just as impressed as I was. It's huge too, I'd recommend taking the lift to the top floor, then work your way down using the staircases (there are two sets on opposite sides of the building). Definitely a must-do for visitors to Singapore."
,,Please go,5.0,,"Loved this temple, breath taking. Photos don't do it justice. Close to chinatown. You can also walk to Duxton Hill and see the old shop houses. Great restaurants in the area too. Good for exploring."
,,Nice place to visit and lunch,5.0,,Museum is very nice. Staff was very nice and helpful in locating a CD that we wanted. We really enjoyed lunch in the cafeteria.
,,Welcoming Temple,4.0,,"This interesting temple was built in 2002. It is colourful with gold and red being the most prominent colours. The ground floor has a small hall, the Avalokitesvara Hall, and a much larger hall which is the main prayer hall, the Maitreya Hall. We were there when prayers were being said and it was a very interesting experience. The walls of the halls are lined with hundreds of Buddhas and plaques in English explain the significance of them. There is an elevator which will take you to the third floor where the museum is. The museum explains the life of Buddha very well. On the fourth floor the sacred tooth is encased in a gold stupa. If you wish to see the stupa check to make sure it will be on public view as it is unveiled only at certain times of the day. There is also a garden on the roof and a vegetarian restaurant in the basement. Allow about one hour visit this interesting temple in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown."
,,Impressive and delightful,5.0,,So much to see and wonder at. Stunning gold. Loved the roof garden and enormous prayer wheel. And the neat shop had big discounts on our visit.
,,Overwhelming place,4.0,,"very nice buddhist temple. you get to see monks pray at around noon time. no photos allowed though on the tooth relic's floor level. lots of other things to see inside. you can buy a gold coin which you will write your name on and put inside a container with gold coins from previous visitors and monks will offer prayer for you, very nice,"
,,Inviting and colourful,4.0,,"Always nice to be welcome, no matter what faith, if any. Colourful and fascinating and I am sure inspiring and comforting to Buddhists."
,,Holy Place for Budha followers,4.0,,Budha's Tooth relic Temple will make you feel the divinity as you enter. The museum is also too good and informative.
,,"The Buddha Tooth (and hair and fingernails), really?",4.0,,"Beautiful temple with a good museum upstairs. Relics of the Buddha on dislplay as well as some really great art. Visit the temple and be sure to go upstairs to the roof to walk the prayer wheel, then to the museaum and even the giftstore was good."
,,Spiritual Journey,5.0,,One feels so peaceful & Spiritual during the Visit to this Well Maintained Temple . Information On Budhism is well displayed & easily understood in four levels of the Temple .
,,Woooow!,5.0,,"Definitely a must see in Singapore! Family friendly, anyone can go. They also have facilities for disable people. A true living piece of art, peaceful and fantastic to learn about the religion, culture and architecture. One of my favorite 'attraction' if Singapore so to speak."
,,Explore it,5.0,,"This temple is huge! I didnt go to the rooftop i want to go again! its genuinly beautiful with quite a bit to see, even to buy but i think its kinda pricey, its a lovely sight in the middle of busy chinatown in bustling singapore, great location great thing to see"
,,Beautiful & Enlightning,5.0,,This was a wonderful place to visit;is is free to enter but you can made a donation . A beautiful building and full of interesting facts
,,A must see.,5.0,,"Beautiful Buddhist temple in the Chinese part of Singapore.
Stunning decoration along the 3 floors and marvelous oasis of peace and flowers on the top floor.
The temple hosts the famous tooth of Buddha (non really visible...) a museum with many interesting statues and artifacts and the main hall for gatherings and prayers.
Remember to wear long sleeves and to stop by at the temple shop to get your lucky charm to take home."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"This Temple is not far from the China Town street markets so try and squeeze in a visit if you are in the area. It is very impressive and although got quite busy it still had a serene and spiritual feeling. When you first enter, the colours, size and 100's of Buddha's have that real WOW factor. People were praying and meditating throughout the Temple which made us feel blessed to be sharing the experience. If you are short for time and unable to visit all floors do take the lift to the top floor. Remember to wear appropiate clothing (no bare shoulders or legs showing) or be prepared to wrap yourself in the shawls provided. You can keep your shoes on though. Amongst the hustle and bustle of Singapore it is a nice place to visit and contmplate life."
,,holy royal great atmosphere,5.0,,the building shows how chinese people in singapore respect the buddha and very complicated on the ceremony even more than we do in Thailand. I just love they way they offer the buddha with flower around the little candle.
,,Must Visit divine place,4.0,,"wether you belive in budhism or not you should visit this place for sheer beauty and peace.

the temple is in china town and it house temple and museum with history about Buddhism. you will feel peace and a treat to eye.

the display of hundred small buddhas in different poses and the zodiac gods and its history is enlightening. Getting an opportunity to look at THE BUDDHA's tooth is an experience. The temple is very well maintained and the architecture and Red colors make it more spiritual experience.

The china town next to the temple is a good place to shop and oriental food."
,,The interior design is amazing!,5.0,,We visited the temple during the month of Chinese New Year where all these street stalls pop out in Chinatown selling various traditional goodies. While shopping we visited the temple and was in awe! The cravings & paintings on the walls & even on the ceilings are so beautiful! It can get really crowded during festive seasons.
,,Buddhist Museum,5.0,,"My wife and I were wandering around near Singapore's Chinese District when an older Chinese gentleman approached and suggested we visit this place. It turned out he was a docent/volunteer and he gave us a free, personalized tour. He was a wealth of knowledge about the many exhibits and pieces of art. Fantastic place which he was very proud of and intent on sharing. If you have even the slightest interest in culture or beauty go and hopefully you will meet the same wonderful gentleman we did. We found Singapore to be a pretty cool place to spend a couple days and not the sterile place some say it is."
,,Feeling blessed,5.0,,"If you know a little about Buddha's contribution and his philosophy, I am sure you will feel blessed when you visit this place. Getting an opportunity to look at THE BUDDHA's tooth is an experience. The temple is very well maintained and the architecture and Red colors make it more spiritual experience. The china town next to the temple is a good place to shop."
,,Ancient modernity,4.0,,Despite an ancient look this is a very recent building in China Town. Do take the time to visit the BTRT&M. Car parking nearby or use the MRT.
,,"Beautiful, free!",5.0,,"Really easy to walk to from the station and within China Town. The building is well maintained, beautifully decorated. My boyfriend is a dentist, so he insisted on seeing the tooth, and in Cambodia, I saw ""the Buddha's single eyebrow hair."" Go up to the top floor and see the garden! If you don't dress appropriately, they offer long skirts and tops, so no stress!"
,,Temple in china town,4.0,,"The temple is situated in china town on the main road. It's beautiful from both outside and inside. The Buddha statues inside are brilliant to see in golden colors. The priests were chanting when visited and created and spiritual atmosphere. You should visit the upper floors too. In an around their is Market of china town and also the night Market.
The place is 5 min walking distance from china town MRT.
One amazing thing is you dont need to remove your shoes which is most common in other temples of Singapore."
,,tranquill,5.0,,go up to the roof to the prayer wheel.in the morning you can see the service and chanting downstairs.If you go to the mezzanine you can watch via screens and see the monks and whole ceremony
,,Peace and quiet in the middle of the city,5.0,,"The museum explains a lot about buddhism, which is helpful to understand the temple. The BTRTM website is also helpful to prepare for your visit. It is worthwhile to time your visit to prayer times, as you don't feel as an intruder, but the athmosphere changes and becomes even more spirtual. If you are interested in buddhism I highly recommend a visit."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"They were having service while I was there, and it was so beautiful. I can't believe how welcoming and tolerant they are of all of the gawkers. It is definitely worth a visit."
,,Put it on the list,4.0,,"Go to China town Singapore and there is plenty to see and do including this temple. Only in Singapore will you find an air conditioned temple! The temple is bright and pretty, full of interesting buddhist images and plenty to learn. I would make sure you get to Smith St and Mosque street, do some shopping, eat some food, go to the museum, wet market and add this temple in"
,,Buddha Temple,5.0,,"Visited temple during prey time , listening to the chants was a great experience.. Was captivated with the surroundings , very very peaceful and serene. Lighted candles and Agarbatties . Spun the wheel on the terrace.
Surrounded by thousands of Buddha's.

- R H Banka
India"
,,Must visit if you're in Chinatown,4.0,,"Liked - The whole 4th floors are airconditioning and carpeted. The displayed are new and explained in english. It is big and there is a lift for access. I like the library where you can take your time to enjoy readings and relax.

Disliked - The last level to the rooftop temple is no access by lift; which must be used by staircase."
,,great tourist spot,5.0,,I went to the temple.. it was a great experience just witnessing the temple in action and praying learning the history. I really enjoyed it. Free entry but u can donate by lighting the insence stick for respect. Great spot for tourist and situated in the heart of china town.
,,great place to visit in chinatown!,4.0,,"beautiful temple full of various sculptures and thousands and thousands of buddhas. Come for both the marvelous sites of the beautiful temple, prayer wheel, etc. as well as to learn about Buddhism, the story of Siddartha Gautama, and the spread throughout Asia. A must visit for anyone coming to china town"
,,good opportunity to see other culture,4.0,,"we donated and lit some incense, but did not go inside, because we were not comfortable that we would be respecting the customs of the people inside. I got the impression that we would have been welcome inside. It was far different than ""church"" at home"
,,It worthy seeing if you a buddhist,4.0,,"It is close to the china town night market and food street. Can shop for souvenirs before or after visiting the temple. The building is beautiful. The restaurant in the temple serve vegetarian lunch until 3pm. Reasonalbe price and taste good, plus all proceeds go to the temple."
,,Nice to visit,3.0,,"Nice to visit, a historical site. You also can proceed to china town from exit this museum. This place also near to food court that provide famous Singapore chicken rice (Tian-Tian Chicken Rice)"
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"Even though I am not a Buddhist, but I like to see how this temple is well preserved and the statues inside are really well kept. The building itself is also beautiful."
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is such a beautiful temple very close to Chinatown. It is really worth a visit. The colours and the decoration are superb.
,,Fascinating,4.0,,would have been useful to have been able to read more about Buddism and the form of worship used at the temple.
,,Fascinating temple and museum,4.0,,"I loved exploring this temple and museum in a very interesting quarter of Singapore - where else would you find an Anglican Church, a mosque and a Buddhist temple within a a block or two."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The temple is nestled in China town hence there is more to do than visiting a site. place is very clean, friendly no rush to view the tooth relic or artefacts. affords a very different experience spiritually as well as culturally. There is a museum inside the temple with lots of interesting data. one comes out to a square bustling with little shops full of souvenirs &trinckets as well as a lot of good Chinese food outlets.
A must visit as it covers China town & a Historical site"
,,Definitely worth a look at if in China Town,5.0,,Scarves and wraps are provided at the door. It is very ornate and only takes a few minutes to go through. It is massive and gorgeous! So many Buddha statues!
,,Very nice Buddha temple,4.0,,"Visited during the first day of Singapore trip. It is located in Chinatown. Very neat, clean and colorful. Very well maintained, as is the whole of Singapore. Gives a feeling of peace. Worth a visit along with Chinatown."
,,Grand!,5.0,,"Very informative about the stories of Buddha and Guan yin, not to mention the grand interior which worth a visit (for free!). And I was pretty impress by the little library, was so cozy after a long walk around China Town :) The wheelchair access at every floor is helpful."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We went to this temple expecting just to walk through on our own. A gentleman came up to us and started talking about the temple and what to see. We thought at first he was wanting to charge us for a tour but he didn't. We had been to the temple on our first visit to Singapore back in 2010. What this gentleman knew about the temple was just incredible, he explained a lot to us. After the tour he did ask us if we would like to go to his factory where they made Buddha's, we declined as we had to meet friends shortly after. Just make sure you wear something to cover your shoulders and probably knees. It was a really great experience with the gentleman explaining everything."
,,Peaceful Haven,5.0,,"This was a beautiful temple, very peaceful and we enjoyed walking around inside and seeing all the Buddah statues."
,,Pretty Cool if you are in China Town,4.0,,"Like most things in Singapore, this attraction alone does not warrant a special trip. But if you are in China Town go ahead and visit this free attraction.

It has a free restroom which is cleaner than most others in the China Town area (in the shopping outlet just behind the restrooms are awful).

I walked around the first floor and enjoyed this experience. If in the area again, I would likely skip this though."
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple - a don't miss in Singapore,5.0,,The relic is too small and far away to see but the gem is the garden on top of the building. The largest enamel prayer wheel is up there too - it's a wonder to behold. You hold a brass rail and walk it around . . . the garden is beautiful.
,,Different experience,4.0,,Very impressive...music /singing by the monks whilst we were there. No charge to visit. Worth a visit
,,A great stumble!,5.0,,"I knew OF this - but wasn't really planning on going when I stumbled across it in my 'meandering'. It was absolutely beautiful. The Buddhist museum is well worth the time - it is well done and very interesting. If you don't know much about Buddhism, it tells the story of the Buddha, then talks about the spread of Buddhism, and the different branches of the religion. There are artifacts from all over Asia to see and you can take photos of all of them. The rooftop garden is a must visit! Completely peaceful. The main hall will take your breath away. The best part is it is FREE - though I did leave a donation."
,,Embarassing moment,2.0,,I brought my overseas friends to visit the temple who found the main hall impressive. However the experience was tarnished by a rude security guard who stared angrily at one of my friends when he tried to take photos of the offerings laid out in the main hall. Is admiring not allowed in the temple? Isn't temple a place for peace and well wishing? Such negative act is least expected for us.
,,Chinatown Temple,4.0,,"Nice looking temple in the middle of Chinatown. Nice to look around but make sure your legs are covered (women, no shorts) as you have to be covered up."
,,"Free entry, near Chinatown Markets",4.0,,"Free entry, easy access from Chinatown and Chinatown markets. Ornate prayer hall. Don't miss out on the rooftop garden."
,,Nice place to spend a hot afternoon,4.0,,"Though recently constructed, this place is a nice tourist spot specially on a hot afternoon (as it is air conditioned). It is a very tourist friendly place and hence doesn't give the authentic feeling...but hey you can't have both ways :-). Visitors can take snaps - even with a flash. Though cut sleeve and shorts above knees are not allowed, they give you clothes to cover your body. All levels have something different to offer. Luckily we were there at 1:30pm for afternoon chants and prayers. It was a very peaceful and calming experience."
,,Hidden Gem,4.0,,Stop by during a Buddhist service if possible (my wife and I were lucky enough to stop by during an investiture of Buddhist nuns. The entryway elevator leads to an excellent balcony view of the interior. One block from the Maxwell Food Court and in the southern corner of Chinatown.
,,Calm and Tranquility in such a busy city,5.0,,"We visited several temples during our stay and we must admit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was the most stunning of the temples we visited,it is situated over several floors and the architecture and decoration is beautiful. well worth a visit"
,,Great visit,4.0,,This place is so beautiful and serene. It is a must to explore each and every floor to fully appreciate the marvellous statues and background stories to Buddhism and Buddhist related topics.
,,cultural experience for western visitors,4.0,,"100s of devout worshipers; giant golden figures and eye catching sacred altars, incense burning. Wonderful experience and an easily accessible during your Chinatown visit."
,,Pleasant diversion,4.0,,"We stopped to take photos and then went into the temple. It is very clean, was surprised to see a library and tea house on the upper level so we stopped for a tea. Very nice place and very peaceful. After this we were blessed by a monk and we made a offering of flowers with a candle burning. You should stop by an after shopping the stalls go inside the temple for some peace and quiet time to reflect and be a little mindful like the Buddha teaches"
,,"Wonderful, free temple",5.0,,"Beautiful Chinese Buddhist temple in Chinatown. Two large halls, one has all the different chinese zodiacs and the other hall has the tooth relic. Locals worship here and tourists are visiting. Photos are allowed! Yay! Bright red and gold is in amazing contrast the the also beautiful Hindu temple nearby. Don't just shop in Chinatown, visit the temple. There is a visitor center outside, as well."
,,Amazing History,4.0,,It was great to see all the artefacts from around the world and find out about their meaning in the teachings. It was a little weird looking around while people were meditating but I guess they are used to blocking out tourists.
,,Exotic and welcoming,4.0,,I foudn this to be quite interesting and different place to visit. I havent been to a buddhist temple before and this was intersting and tranquil in a very busy city.
,,Not on some maps yet..........,4.0,,"This wasnt on the maps we picked up at the hotel, or mentioned in our guide book, but it's a must see in Singapore. Consisting 4 floors in the heart of Chinatown, there is indeed an attributed Buddha Tooth relic, but it's a living temple too, with a roof-top garden, and a museum that is well worth an hour or two.

We stumbled upon it whilst wandering, it really was a highlight of our visit."
,,wonderful and eye openning,5.0,,really worth going lots to see and inspiring. 4 sessions a day with several floors . going again tom..
,,"Calm, quiet, and a good photo-op",4.0,,"If you'd rather spend some quiet time over shopping for cheap trinkets in Chinatown, this is a good place to go. The shrines and prayer hall on the ground floor contrast with the more quiet museum floors above, and the hall where the relic is kept and venerated."
,,Beautiful and peaceful Temple,5.0,,"Temple has 5 floors with garden on the roof. When I was there in the ground floor was ceremony so it was very crowded and loud.
In the roof is gorgeous garden, very quit so it is perfect for meditation or relaxing.
There is also room for meditation, museum with relict of Buddha and gift shop.
This temple is worth visiting."
,,alchemy,5.0,,I was there while they were celbrating the prayers and it has been a foreboding experience with their chants enrapting my usually pragmatic brain the place is a blaze of gold and colur
,,Took my breath away,5.0,,"I've been to this 4-story temple in Chinatown three times now and have loved it each time. It's beautiful from the outside but absolutely a feast for the eyes inside and it takes my breath away each time I visit. It's also a wonderful place to walk through to get out of the heat!

Also, each time I've been there, something different has been going on. Sometimes there have been monks chanting, another time there were many candles, and one time the temple was filled with offerings of fruit and food people had placed there.

You are free to walk around to view everything, and free to take photos except it's bad manners to take photos of the offerings when they're there. If you have bare arms or legs, they will loan you a wrap.

It was difficult to actually see the tooth that is the relic the temple was built to house. I looked at postcard and that helped me figure out what was actually the tooth.

There's a small garden on one floor... another floor is a museum with artifacts. And one area has the history of the Buddha.

,,VERY RELIGIOUS TEMPLE FOR BUDDHIST,4.0,,"The temple is very close to china town metro station and a hindu kovil.
The Buddhist devotees should go there and pay respect to the lord Buddha's tooth relic which was opened most of the time.
The ample space inside the temple will give the devotees the time to pray and do there pooja at there will."
,,Peaceful Temple,4.0,,"Beautiful temple with classical architecture. A different experience ...specially the surroundings, small eateries"
,,A buddhist temple with 5 stories!,5.0,,"Apart from the overflowing golden decoration, this temple surprises with his numerous stories each welcoming to a new approach to the buddhist religion: touristic floor, praying area for the worshiping, but also a museum, and a mediation garden on the roof!"
,,"gorgeous, a real must",5.0,,Definitely go here. Not only is it gorgeous (and unlike most other temples I went to in SE Asia) but it doesn't take long to visit and it's centrally located just a few blocks from the MRT station and right near Smith street for great food

,,So peaceful,4.0,,"I loved this temple. The history is very interesting and has a really calming effect. The roof garden is a must to go up to and sit and 'think.' Ladies, make sure you take a shawl to cover your shoulders."
,,Buddhism,5.0,,Take your time with this one-it has 5 floors and a roof top garden-work your way down and see each individual floor you will be dumbstruck-we went back a second time to take it all in again and to buy some lucky money so our names could be put on our donation and give us luck.
,,The Gem of China Town,5.0,,This five story building is house to Buddha's tooth reclic. First fllor is the temple with Buddha stautus and 3rd fllor onward is the museum. The top floor house the tooth relic. Interesting pplace to visit in Singapore China Town.
,,Nice temple,4.0,,"Huge temple with many collections of statues. I took a lot of pictures there with my friends. Really nice to visit when you are in Singapore, especially when you are in Chinatown."
,,nice and a very clean museum,4.0,,"you could spent a couple of hours to check the faces of buddha.. if your lucky, you might run into the middle of a buddhis ceremony.. quite nice.. and the surrounding atmosphere is also interesting"
,,A real jewel of local culture in the middle of chinatown,5.0,,"A truly fantastic experience.

Don't miss the prayer room and all the figurines at the ground floor, the Buddhist museum and the rooftop garden.

A visit is not complete if you have not turned the giant prayer wheel!!!!

(And yes, the Buddha Tooth in the temple is in gold and not in tooth :-) )"
,,"great temple, a lot of amazing buddha statue",5.0,,"It's really a great buddha temple.. there are a lot of buddha statue, some made by gold.. at the floor where the relic store, the floor made from gold.. It place at china town, everybody should come by.. dont miss it"
,,Close to China Town,3.0,,"A nice temple and museum to visit, close to China Town. The museum is very informative and has a rooftop garden. Would have been better if its walls were open and offered views of the city. Instead, its all baricaded."
,,Lovely Temple,5.0,,"It looks impressive from outside. Once inside it is clean, shiny and glitters everywhere you look at. People praying while tourist wondering around and taking pictures. An eye opener for Buddhist religion."
,,Step inside and experience something special,4.0,,"We didn't have any intention of entering the temple, except for a kindly somewhat toothless old man who said it was a special place and spoke with such reverence about it. So in we went and were fortunate to be there at a time the monks were praying and chanting. A stop and reflect moment. Well worth a trip inside if you are exploring the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. Helps to dress with respect for the environment."
,,Great to visit,4.0,,"Great to see a temple kept so clean, very peaceful. Glad we went to see it, a cultural experience.veryeasy to find, just near China Town,very colourful You need to remove your shoes and leave them out front."
,,"Temple, which looks historic",4.0,,go also to the fifth floor and see the garden. very beautiful. Besides it gives some insights culture- wise.
,,Can't miss this important site in Chinatown,4.0,,Make sure you're dressed appropriately to enter this temple (no shorts or bare shoulders). Beautiful and huge! Great for pictures from the outside.
,,A must every time I visit SG,5.0,,"I have been to the temple many times and I still enjoy it during each trip. There are several levels to visit, not just the prayer hall on the ground floor, which in itself is already awesome. On the upper floors are a great museum and an outdoor garden, all with Buddhist sculptures. The 4th floor contains the Buddha tooth relic. No shoes, no camera and as in the whole building a dress code applies."
,,An intriguing temple,3.0,,"All of the usual colours and smells of such a temple. So many little buddhas around the walls. Not as commercial as many, but please leave them some money to help them carry on their charity work"
,,Gold and even more gold,5.0,,Worth a visit just to see the solid gold tiles in the upstairs temple! Try the vegetarian restaurant across the way. Great variety of 'meats' and 'fish' to dazzle the palate. You wouldn't know you were eating bean curd!!
,,Fascinating insight into Buddhism,5.0,,"There was a ceremony in the temple at the time when we attended, but we were still able to walk around and take photographs of the stunning interior. There is a great deal else to see over four floors, each with its own interesting displays. There are many items and works of Art connected with Buddhism, from many different places, and seeing the differences and variations between objects was very interesting. The Buddha 's tooth relic was in a quiet reflective area and there were places for visitors to meditate or do yoga. Not recommended for younger children, perhaps, but very well worth visiting for everyone else."
,,You've seen one temple....,3.0,,"Not that they are all alike, but one is very similar to another. Very impressive if it's the first time, but it wasn't."
,,nothing much if u r not a budhism,3.0,,"if u have a chance to go there, get to the roof!! the roof garden is really nice also the 4th floor have a air-con"
,,Great intro to a Buddhist Temple,5.0,,We were greeted by a friendly man at the entrance. I was offered a shawl since I wore a sleeveless shirt. There was a worship service with chanting on the first floor and a wedding on the fourth floor. All very interesting to us Catholic Christians. We were surprised to learn that the temple was completed only five years ago. Go to the 5th floor for the tranquil rooftop garden. Highly recommended the Buddha Tooth Temple.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very beautiful temple, visitor friendly. While there they were chanting and it was lovely to hear. Buddhas cover the walls everywhere. I would recommend."
,,buddhists chanting,3.0,,"We were recommended to go in here by the taxi driver. I was given a shawl to cover my shoulders. Inside was really brightly couloured with lots of lantern type things hanging up and the buddhists chanting. There was to be a chinese celebration the next day so it could have been something to do with that. A quick walk round with two young boys and we were done, nice place to see but just another thing to tick off."
,,Nice surprise in Chinatown,4.0,,"This Buddhist temple in Chinatown is a good combo of functioning temple and informative museum. It is filled with Buddhist relics from various areas.

I particularly enjoyed the top floor garden and temple house. There is a room lined with small Bhudda images and a large prayer wheel."
,,Photo Op...,3.0,,"Tacky, gaudy Chinese temple right in the heart of Chinatown. No real reason to visit this temple but since you will likely already be in Chinatown, this makes a good backdrop for photos! Kind of fun to go in and poke around but nothing of any real historical or cultural value. If you do go inside, make a point of going to the top. The garden on the roof is quite cute."
,,Peaceful oasis in the middle of the bustling city,4.0,,We just stumbled across this wonderful little gem when wandering around Chinatown. Very interesting -- but mostly it was the overall feeling of the temple that impressed us. Very peaceful and calming and respectful. A lovely break and oasis in the middle f the bustling major metropolis.
,,Definitely Visit when in China Town,4.0,,"It's a nice cultural experience. We decided to visit it quick but were stuck there for almost an hour because of rains. But we were happy about that, we got a chance to watch some riligious rituals and prayers by big no. of kids. We felt tranquil and spiritual!"
,,The real deal,5.0,,"This temple is the real deal. No matter what religion you are once inside you feel the power of something greater than you. The chanting was amazing. They allow photos, some of the best of my trip."
,,"While your in Chinatown, go and see",4.0,,"If you have never seen or been to a Buddhist Temple, this is a must see. It is amazing in its beauty and preservation. I was there on a Sunday in Chinatown, and though there were many people at the markets, this the Temple was not very crowded. It was nice to go in and see all the intricate detail. I being Cathloic, have seen many cathedrals, and this temple is beyond any religious space I've ever seen. It's awe inspiring and incredible history all come together here.

There is also a Hindu temple in Chinatown that is amazing and a must see."
,,Power of religion,5.0,,"There are 4 or 5 floors in the temple. In the first (ground floor) you can see praying seats, clerics who are leading the session and a lot of relics and interesting objects. If you come during the praying time it is poweful experience to hear the sound of praying people. In the second floor is a gallery where you can see the first floor from top. In the next floors are silent meditation room, museum and a souvenir shop. Everything has spiritual inspiration and very pleasant atmosphere. There is also small garden on the roof. This place is worth to visit. Take your camera, be ready for worse light conditions. Don't forget to smile!"
,,Lovely!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,Its beautiful!!! with a royal red and golden colour throughout and its located in Chinatown if you are around you must visit this temple!
,,Nice stop in China Town,4.0,,"Went here at night and was lucky that we went at a time when the monks were holding prayer. They still let you walk through the temple during this session as long as you are quiet, respectful and dont take pictures. They have shawls outside to cover your arms and legs if your clothing isnt appropriate. Inside the temple was pretty and outside they had lanterns hanging which was a nice effect. The rest of China Town seemed a little touristy and seedy but this temple definitely stood out! I am glad that we made the stop by it."
,,Very informative,4.0,,We came accross this place as part of a self-guided walking tour that we found through a helpful poster on the forum. Although this is a relatively new temple we were very impressed. Not only was it spectacular and ornate but there was a lot of information about the history and philosophy of Buddha and his journey. Well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It is really nice, walk around Chinatown, lots of souvernirs and foot massage places, The temple is one of the most beautifu in Asia."
,,Great stop,4.0,,"We were in the Chinatown area and badly needed air condition to cool down. Stopped in here for relief but were pleasantly surprised by the information. We are not Buddhist, but were intrigued by the origins and stories presented in the museum."
,,educational tour,5.0,,"One would expect to see only Buddha statues and incense in a temple, but this particular temple offers more than just that! Apart from magnificently carved statues (including one Guardian God for each of the twelve Zodiac signs), there are tooth relics and an exhibition detailing the history and origin of Buddhism. Well-worth a trip down to the temple!"
,,Treasure within Chinatown,4.0,,"Access to the temple via MRT requires 20 minutes walk from the Outram or Chinatown station. From outside it looks like a modern building w pagoda design. If you visit during the Lunar 1st and 15th of the month, prayers and chanting starts early in main hall on ground floor and 4th floor where the Tooth Relic is kept. On the 4th floor are 2 raised platforms w cushions for meditation. The museum is worth a visit to understand the different Buddhas except that it is cluttered. Visit also the 2nd floor where the library and store is, you can purchase a Buddhist text to trace write which is said to bring many merits for the layperson. But it is available only in chinese. Scarfs are provided for ladies who wear sleeveless or shorts. Photography allowed except on the 4th floor. Signages and descriptions are in english so its easy to understand even for non Buddhists."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,This is a beautiful temple in the bustling Chinatown. Try to go during Hungry Ghost Festival or CNY when the temple is festooned with hundreds of lanterns. Great eating near by.
,,Two hours! More than i expected,3.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but two hours later and five floors down, I was calmer and more enlightened. Don't go expecting to see the tooth! Do go if you wanto learn and feel more about buddhasiml."
,,educational and cool inside!,4.0,,"We stumbled upon this place and thought it was another tourist place to check off the list, however were pleasantly surprised. It was interesting to learn how Buddhism originated. The layout was very nice and we enjoyed the gold room. Quite fantastic display. We donated at the end since we were so impressed with the upkeep."
,,"Visit if nearby, but is it a tourist trap?",3.0,,"This is a relatively new temple and takes on tones of the surrounding china town area which has been redeveloped so it looks stunning from the outside but feels a bit tacky and touristy, lacking the character the old Chinatown had. Don't get me wrong, everything is beautifully presented inside and the building is very impressive from the outside, it just lacks atmosphere and feels a bit like an exercise to extract dollars from tourists. Do visit if you are close by (especially as it is air-conned so you can escape the heat) but I think the nearby Thian Hock Keng temple is a far better example of a Buddhist religious building and from there you can go on to get some cheap, authentic Singaporean eats at the Amoy St. hawker food centre."
,,Worth a visit if you are in China Town,4.0,,"Lovely Temple and well worth a visit if you are in China Town. I have been twice now, the first time I went around on my own the next time I tagged along with an elderly man who was showing people around. It was interesting and informative and I learnt lots about the various Buddha's. I would suggest starting at the lovely roof garden at the top and gradually working down the various floors. It's not immediately obvious that you can enter the temple but there are lifts just inside on the far right. It's worth eating at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre as well which is just across the road."
,,Worth seeing,4.0,,"Small, but lovely temple - especially if monks are in prayer. Don't miss the old men playing mahjong outside. Women should be courteous cover bare arms (and legs if wearing shorts) using shawls provided to the right of the entrance."
,,Tranquille,4.0,,"A beautiful Buddhist temple, make sure that you take time to visit the 4th floor to see the relic with the golden floor"
,,Well worth going!,5.0,,"Nowadays, most of Chinatown is a tacky tourist trap. This temple is decidedly *not* a tourist trap!
If you are used to - and love - the ancient temples of South-East Asia, this one will at first strike you with it's obvious ""newness"", but it's still more than worth a visit. This is an active place of worship, and a busy one, full of opulent gold and colourful statues. Don't just wander around the ground floor - the other floors are worth it, too. The roof-top is very quiet and a great place to get some rest from the buzz of the city.
I'll definitely add this temple to my list of ""must-see places""."
,,Interesting - crowded,4.0,,In the midst of China Town. Small and crowded. Visually impressive with statues and ornaments. Pleasantly surprising temple. Information shop next door where you can book all your sightseeing.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth relic Temple and Museum is situated in the centre of Chinatown, easily accessible on foot. Take your time to go through the welcoming temple, calm and relaxing oasis in the bustling city of Singapore. Enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, singing monks and smiling people around. This was an unforgettable experience for someone who came there from the West!"
,,Enjoyed it so much we went back again,5.0,,"Our first visit we got roped in by a man we thought at first was a guide, he was in all fairness very informative and showed us around, however after we left the temple he very VERY strongly tried to coerce us in to visiting his jewellery shop.
None the less we enjoyed the Temple however felt it was rushed and also realised we hadnt seen the roof top garden so returned a few days later.
This time we wandered at our own leisure and were so pleased we had returned as the roof top garden is a beautiful peaceful place that houses a huge prayer wheel that was quite amazing, we were lucky to be there at the same time as another visitor who was familiar with the formalities of the prayer wheel and gave us an insight in to 'how & why'.
We purchased a few gold coins which you write your name (or someone elses) on and place in the box as an offering in return for health, prosperity & happiness (hope Ive explained that correctly, apologies if not).
You could describe the temple as gaudy and very over the top with the elaborate displays and abundance of gold however its certainly a sight to see. Regardless of our religeous beliefs we found the experience to be very spiritual and was a highlight of our trip.
*Women wearing shorts/short skirt must cover their legs with a sarong you can borrow at the entrance."
,,A must see Buddha's Tooth and Real Gold Tiled Floor,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth relic Temple and Museum is located in the heart of Chinatown. Take off your shoes to enter the higher level floor where the relic of Buddha's tooth was found in 1980 in a stupa in Myanmar. he gold floor - real gold - is stunning. No photos permitted but a visit to this temple and put it on your list.
,,i respect buddhism,5.0,,"i simply love to visit to the temple.The sounds of monks chanting, an enormous colorful sanctuary with devout people praying before huge statues. It's a welcoming place, and cloths are provided ,The prayer wheel and roof garden are worth and amazing . Also, be sure to stop at the floor with the actual reliquary of the Buddha's tooth--the vibrant reds and real gold tiles are powerful testaments."
,,Beautiful new Temple,5.0,,"With 10,000 Buddha statues, this temple is amazing. It contains a museum with fascinating historical pieces and a garden on top. This was the only Buddist Temple we visited in Singapore and it is spectacular. It was right across the street from our hotel, The Scarlet, just on the edge of China Town"
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is absolutely beautiful temple with several floors and garden at the top. Very impressive yet peaceful. Nice quiet coffee shop. Local food court nearby for the real hawker centre experience.
,,Modern Chinese temple with awesome collections!,4.0,,"This is definitely a modern style Chinese temple. It is pretty comfortable inside and it's mind-boggling to see those buddha tooth relic at the top floor.

For ladies, try not to wear shorts when entering the temple. They will provide a piece of cloth to cover your leg though.

Nearby there is a food court with huge number of choice, so you can grab some food before going to this temple."
,,A Peaceful Oasis,5.0,,"You really step into a different world ,away from the mad rush of China town. The relics in the upper floors are not to be missed as is the small but beautiful roof top garden.You can wander about peacefully in air conditioned comfort. The elevator makes access easier.Definitely worth a visit."
,,Peaceful space,4.0,,"Really worth a visit if only to see the crazy amount of gold around the tooth relic. Also, make sure you go upstairs to the garden."
,,Amazing religious place,4.0,,it's amazing to have a sight of buddha tooth relic inside which is such a amazing spiritual experience. the place itself is well preserved until now. It was a worthy place to come over! :D
,,Huge collection of Buddhist art!,5.0,,I never would have known going in what a wonderful collection of buddhist art that this museum has... there were pieces from around the world and across many cultures. Very interesting piece of history and insight further into Buddhism and its practices. Must see!
,,Missing the charm of the older temples,3.0,,"Don't think you are visiting a traditional temple. This is a very large and well planned tourist attraction (with investor support given the real estate location on the boundary of Chinatown).

Unfortunately it is lacking a certain zen that you expect from Buddhist temples anywhere in Asia.

Clean and stylised. If you are already in Chinatown then it's worth a 10 min flyby. However many other lovely temples that merit your attention in Singers."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,"The temple atsmophere was stunning, and make good photo object, if youre lucky enough you should see the monk ceremony , for please bring youre wide lense if you visit this place, it will made a worthed picture"
,,A must to visit,5.0,,"The temple is beautiful. One should not miss out. Do not eat or dine at the restaurant near by, Lee Tong Kee Restaurant. It is overpriced and the food is nasty."
,,It really gets you in a religious mood,5.0,,"Although it doesn't look much on the outside, on the inside it is trully amazing. We got there while they were performing a buddhist service and the atmosphere was that of pure reverence. You can get in from the front door and go out from the back door; that way you can look at the whole temple."
,,Great place for a peace of mind,5.0,,"It's amazing, for both religious and non-religious people. Reach the temple after a walk through the crowded and great Chinatown, you will soon find a peace of mind at this temple. Rumour that it is the richest temple and town and believe me, it may be right with the air-conditioned temple with elevator. You will be able to see the Buddha tooth relic and pray for your family members."
,,"Interesting, if biased perspective of Buddhist history",3.0,,"This museum was interesting, but not quite what I expected. The temple was extremely flashy, with price tags on everything allowing you to sponsor items to enable upkeep of the place. Even so it was an interesting experience.

The museum contained an impressive collection of Buddhist artefacts from around the world all with slightly baffling and predictably one-eyed historical commentary. The artefacts are fantastic and the relics interesting to see, though the sceptic in me would guess that these relics are not quite what they are claimed to be.

Really worth a visit if you're curious but for me it was a little too flashy and jarred slightly with Buddhist monks vow of poverty."
,,A piece of Chinatow and Buddhist culture you won't find elsewhere!,5.0,,"We were in awe of this place, and I had no idea we would spend as much time as we did roaming around! There was a service going on when we visited, and they proceeded as if none of the hundreds of people were watching. Anyone who wanted to meditate or pray along the way was welcome. There were plenty of written narratives to help the rest of us understand a bit about what was going on.

There are several floors that include a museum and a rooftop orchid garden. Don't skip the upper levels! If you happen t oarrive in shorts or sleeveless shirt, they will ask you to cover with a scarf that they provide, out of respect. And while you cannot take photos in the museum, you may during the service. There is also a vegetarian cafe in the basement for a meal or snack during your visit."
,,Interesting ornaments,4.0,,"This is a very big temple and it has so many Buddhas inside.
It was an interesting cultural experience to see Chinese people and monks praying and not being bothered by the tourists taking photos so close to them.
Worth paying a visit.

Tip: Remember to cover your shoulders and dress adequately!"
,,A humbling and intriguing experience.,5.0,,"I wanted to sample Chinese culture in Singapore and decided to get lost in Chinatown, which led me to this gem. This temple is an ornate and magnificent glimpse into not only Chinese, but Mahayana Buddhist culture. This 5 story temple is open to the public, perhaps to a faulty. I felt a bit guilty at how easy it was to walk around and snap photos of people while they were in the middle of a sermon. The people were very friendly and helpful though which was nice. On the upper floors the temple feels more like a museum and it's there where camera usage is not as open. The main alter which supposedly holds the tooth relic is an ornate and interesting experience. For a small donation, you are able to be blessed by a Buddhist monk (a truly humbling and interesting experience). The rooftop mezzanine has a garden and is a nice place to stop and catch your breath.

Overall I highly recommend this for not just a Chinese cultural experience, but for a Buddhist, and Asian cultural experience as well. It truly is a nice gateway experience that will leave you hungry to learn more about Buddhism and Asia as a whole."
,,Nice temple and museum,4.0,,"I love the temple as it not only gives visitors a good tour of the temple, but the musuem is also an interesting place to visit. The only thing that I did not like was the security staff - they were a little uptight about keeping everything in perfect order."
,,real experience,5.0,,Great way to explore new cultures and religions. Amazing temple. In the middle of Chinatown and close to the souvenirs shops. Nearby local restauraqnts at good price and good food
,,Amazing temple!,5.0,,Beautiful temple! Check out the top floor and you get to see some of the section cover with gold. There are alot of sutra and statues around.
,,"Vibrant, colourful, awesome",5.0,,"Just at the end of Chinatown, loved the sculptures and the thousand details inside. Nice area too, with locals mixing with tourists at Chinatown Complex Food Centre."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"The temple was big and looked nice. If you follow the religion, for sure you should visit it. If you do not, you still should visit it anyway, as there are nice view and nice place for tourists to know more of the religion.
I was impressed by many statues with different positions of buddha.
For short, nice place, you should visit it."
,,Another treat,5.0,,"What a treat to be able to walk through a working temple and watch the worshippers from a respectful distance. Regardless of your religious beliefs, this is a moving experience. A place of colour and calm."
,,"Sights, Sounds and Smells Provide an Immersive Experience",5.0,,"The sounds of monks chanting, an enormous colorful sanctuary with devout people praying before huge statues, and the smell of wafting incense create an experience that will transport you spiritually, no matter what your beliefs. It's a welcoming place, and sarongs are provided if your garb is deemed inappropriate. The prayer wheel and roof garden are worth the trip up. Also, be sure to stop at the floor with the actual reliquary of the Buddha's tooth--the vibrant reds and real gold tiles are powerful testaments to demonstrative worship."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Entrance is free. If you go when the monks are chanting, you will get a true sense of this Buddhist temple. The prayer wheel on the top floor was amazing."
,,Brilliant find - explore all the floors,5.0,,"I personally found this to be the most interesting temple of all that I visited in Singapore.
The artefacts are amazing. There is a room up on the roof full of very small Buddha statues. Each one must have taken so much work and there are 10,000 of them!
Upstairs in the temple is a museum of Buddhist artefacts and it is a fascinating insight into Buddhism.
The spine-tingling moment was when we were up on the balcony and some monks came in to pray. To observe this felt such a privilege.
We stumbled across this temple and is probably one of the most memorable places I went while in Asia."
,,I love Singapore,5.0,,We visited Chinatown with no real expectations. That changed as soon as we sighted the Bhuddas tooth temple. It may not be hundreds of years old but sooo impressive.
,,"If you want to visit a Buddhist temple in Singapore, pick this one.",5.0,,"Visited during the day and was impressed by both sight and sound. Not an old historic-looking temple, but definitely quite grand because of its size and decorations. Walls are adorned with hundreds of smaller buddhas and rich wood panelling. Gold glimmers from the giant statues in the middle of the hall. The monks happened to be leading a meditation at the time of my visit and this was quite a treat to witness. Their recitations could be heard from outside the hall and inside, devout Singaporean followers young and old sat quietly at tables and followed along. Nice that this temple allows for photos unlike some others. Scarves are available at the entrance for people to cover their bare arms and shoulders before entering."
,,Buddha’s Middle Way or Singapore’s extravagant way?,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple unashamedly promotes the Singaporean-Chinese community’s vast wealth over the Malay & Indians communities. Its large, decadent, free & welcomes people of all faiths to visit & drool over.

The thousands of gold statues & idols in this temple would make many Muslim fundamentalists nervous at standing anywhere near an explosive vest. The temple interior is richly decorated in generous red & gold colors & thousands of golden Buddha statues of various sizes. The interior has a feng shui layout giving worshippers & guests alike a very pleasant vibe. Like a zoo, tourists can stand around the sides & take pictures of monks chanting in their rich robes, they seem pretty calm about all this, just don’t feed them peanuts.

The tooth apparently originated from a collapsed Burmese temple, but I wouldn’t be surprised if those Burmese sold them a tall story & some other old guy’s teeth. Super rich Singapore needing a religious tourist attraction & there just happened to be a spare Buddha tooth lying around? All these temples claiming to have the Buddha’s teeth, some must surely be fake or Buddha must've really been a crocodile.

Located in Chinatown, a 10 min walk from the MRT station surrounded by food & market stalls, restaurants & lots of locals & tourists make for a lively atmosphere & a great place for people watching."
,,Quite an impressive structure,4.0,,"On our travels around around the city, we came across the Temple when we reaches Chinatown. It is well maintained and sits well within its environment. Unfortunately we didn't have time to enter inside and visit the museum, but would ensure we would if we return to Singapore."
,,This is a lovely temple,5.0,,Amazing display of what seems to be several thousand statues of Buddha. Right in Chinatown so easy to explore both.
,,Very Clean and well maintained temple,5.0,,"this temple is great place for tourist..especially on the top floor you can find very nice garden. i was amazed on the floor where the ""tooth relic"" saved...it's really amazing"
,,A must see,5.0,,A lovely place to get some peace and quiet whilst visiting china town. There is an interesting museum on the top floor. Deffinately a must do if in Chinatown .
,,China Town Buddha Toothchinese temple,5.0,,.This temple in the heart of ChinaTown.There are 4 storey high.Inside the temple there are different types of Buddha Statues and it explain the difference of different type of buddha.On the 4th floor we can do meditation and there is also anice garden. can also try the vegetarian food is super
,,Amazing,5.0,,I was at Chinatown and stumbled upon this temple. It was on the list of things I wanted to see. So glad I did. The best experience I personally had in Singapore. The different floors are incredible. The top floor with the largest prayer roll in the world is gorgeous. I was able to meditate on the 4th floor. It was so peaceful and quiet. Great spiritual moment and I'm not even Buddhist.
,,Temple relic and Visit,5.0,,Located in Chinatown a must visit temple.Felt peace when in the temple compound. Friendly and helpful temple staff ready at any time to answer your inquires. Must visit and feel the experiences yourself.
,,Wonderful Temple in China Town,5.0,,"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in the fact that I arrived at the temple 15 minutes prior to closing time. But the temple itself was quite amazing. Wonderful architecture, the interior was breath taking. The contracting red tapestries and the gold shrines are incredible. I will certainly plan to return with more time so I can get to the upper levels."
,,Impressive building !,3.0,,"Impressive building an beautiful garden on the roof, but everything seems to be artificial. Probably the price to pay for such a recent building."
,,I was in AWE!,4.0,,"You'll be amazed with the 10,000 Golden Buddhas surrounding the temple. And you may also find which Buddha is protecting you based on your birth year/ Chinese astrology!"
,,Inspiring,5.0,,I was blown away by the chanting. Be sure to cover all five floors including the museums and the rooftop garden. Very serene in such a city setting.
,,pleased,5.0,,"Found this very interesting, better than other temples we looked at. It was easy to get to and many food and drink vendors near by"
,,Impressive Temple - go to the roof!,4.0,,"A quick visit is all that this temple needs, but it is very impressive. Make sure to go right to the top of the temple, to the roof, to see the prayer wheel and the 10,000 buddhas."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"My family and I visited the temple during the afternoon. There were many tourists around but fortunately it wasn't too packed. The temple is decorated with statues of all sizes of Chinese deities. The middle of the hall at the first hall was cordoned off for prayer chants. We are able to walk around the area. There is a backyard-like area towards the back. On the second floor, there is a museum with relics and descriptions. Really interesting. The main attraction is the buddha tooth relic on the third floor. The environment is calm and the hall was decorated with gold ornaments. There are also corners for meditation. Very very beautiful. On the top floor, there is a japanese garden. Serene and relaxing. Overall, an interesting place to visit."
,,Excellent Temple and Museum,5.0,,Spent an hour walking around this beautiful Temple...free entry into it...stunning...peaceful and utterly quiet and respectful.
,,Inspiring,4.0,,a good place to find your inner peace...... the articles are well preserved and worth visiting....
,,"Not just a landmark, but an actively used temple",5.0,,"It was so nice too see a Buddhist ceremony taking place. A wee bit of culture in a busy metropolis. I was v surprised that tourists were allowed to go in and watch, and even take photos. This was a gr8 eye opener for our kids. We stayed and watched for ages. The temple itself was also acing, so much gold & so ornate. Don't miss the roof top garden, there is a hidden surprise up there."
,,A tranquil place,4.0,,"I find this a tranquil place, even though there are many people visiting. The staff are very helpful, We saw a ceremony taking place, the chanting was mesmorising, it was very beautiful."
,,Eye opening,5.0,,Having never seen a Buddhist Temple before we found this visually stunning.
,,Speaking as a Westerner...This was AMAZING!,5.0,,"Plan to spend about two hours visiting all 5 floors of this temple. So beautiful..and in most areas, photos are welcomed. The staff was friendly and courteous to we ""ignorant"" westerners. I am so glad we stumbled across this gem. A highlight of our trip to Singapore!"
,,Perfect Respite from Rain and/or Strong Sun,5.0,,"Beautiful architecture and lovely atmosphere. Well worth a visit if you are in Chinatown. Do bring a camera and be modestly attired (though they do lend shawls to cover up). There are lots of information on Buddhism as well as many different Buddha sculptures. Interior is very ornately decorated. On the top floor, there is a peaceful garden filled with orchids and small water pools. Also, there is a large pagoda which houses a Buddha Prayer Wheel which looks amazing to me."
,,impressive but gaudy,2.0,,"The place is large and really impressive. The building is filled with amazing statuary on the lower level, a golden sanctuary on the upper floor, and a wonderful garden on the roof. At some point the amount of gold--tiles, statues, outfits, etc--becomes almost impressive, and many of the items are labeled with the names of corporate sponsors and such. It feels a bit like a Nascar version of Buddhism. Personally I prefer a more classic, neighborhood-like feel such as the Thian Hock Keng Temple"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"A massive temple in China Town, suurounded by narrow streets, hawkers and small shops, overlooked by high rise apartments. Painted bright red and gold, this Chinese building stands out. The incense and chanting of the monks and budhist is calming and soothing. The granduer of the decor with its statues and shrines & altar make this an impressive place of worship. You are allowed to take photos. Mine can out OK without a flash."
,,free,5.0,,"free, lovely temple, of Buddha, easy go to chinatown station and walk striaght like 3 blocks then left , ask them , many ways to find it"
,,The garden with 10000 Buddha's is the perfect rest stop in the heat,4.0,,"Beautiful temple and very informative. My shorts were on so l needed to cover my legs these are provided for free, it was an impressive temple with dedication to the buddha.
I loved the escape of the rooftop garden it was so peaceful. If you are in chinatown this is a must stop."
,,Colorful temple,4.0,,A large buddhistic temple on the edge of Chinatown. Contructed in 2007. Very colorful. You can take an elevator to the top floor (which has a garden) and walk down from there. Ladies can get clothes to cover legs and shoulders at the entrance .
,,So much information,5.0,,"Love the idea of Bhuddism, but didn't know too much about it until went through this exhibition"
,,Recent construction,5.0,,"Most visitors will realise this is not ancient heritage but you should still go for the insight. Great atmosphere although some of the nearby trader's stalls are selling such kitsc material.

Our guide stated that the temple cost sixty million Singapore dollars to build. He seemed impressed by that. Do note that the tooth relic is not usually on view."
,,full of serenity,5.0,,it was quite amazing to see all the floor. It is well thought and well explained. I liked the garden roof and the little musee and to try the vegeterian food.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"This place is awesome and well worth a visit. Very ornate with hundreds of Buddhas on the walls. Both men and women need to be ""modestly"" attired. If not they will lend you cover-ups. The interior is very ornate with gold leaf everywhere. Check each Buddha carefully and you will see small differences between them. There is a set that are wearing representations of the Chinese years, pigs, cocks, etc."
,,Countless Buddha Statues,5.0,,"Magnificent temple.. Beautiful architectural, well maintained, there are a looott of Buddha Statues from small size to Large size in every wall.
Don't miss the rooftop garden, you can reach by an elevator on the right side of the entrance and then looking for the exit door- walk up through 2 level stairs and open the door.. Voila, you're welcome by serenity Orchid Garden, with statues all over the wall. There is chamber there with a big tube which circulate by pushing it, every 1 cycle there's a bell ring on top of the tube.. (am not sure what is the meaning of this ritual)

On the 4th floor there's a Hall which is prohibited to took pictures. Here you can see the chamber with gold details from statues to the tiles, it's secured by the glass wall only Monks can get in."
,,must visit,5.0,,"Great temple, the chanting monks and congregation were atmospheric. Worth a visit, be prepared to be asked to wear a sarong to cover your legs if your shorts or skirt is above your knees and a shawl if your shoulders are showing."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,Such a beautiful place of worship. Amazing architecture and the detail inside is fantastic.
,,Blessed by a monk,5.0,,It was rainy that day and it was the must do thng while n China town. We were blessed by a monk in the tooth room.
,,Serene and Peaceful,5.0,,"We simply love the place. It is a must visit place for Buddhist and non Buddhist alike. The temple is modern, clean, serene and the people there are just excellently friendly. Go to the roof top garden and experience the peaceful atmosphere."
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,5.0,,"I come fom Sri Lanka where we have the Buddha Tooth Relic temple in Kandy, and so thought I must visit the temple in Singapore. There are similarities and differences, but the feeling inside the temple was very peaceful."
,,Nice temple in Chinatown,4.0,,Big temple with beautiful statues in Chinatown. New building.
,,"Stunningly beautiful, serene!",5.0,,"The temple is very well kept, in very good condition. If you visit this place, make sure you walk on all the 4 floors and the roof garden.
The meditation room on the 3rd (or 4th?) floor is the amazing-est of them all. So peaceful and relaxing.

another great thing about this place is that it's located at Chinatown, which is an attraction in itself!

please keep at least an hour for this place, and do visit all the floors. ="
,,Very nice chinese Buddha temple with Indian names of varoius idols of Buddha,4.0,,"The temple is excellent with interiors well treated dominated with innovative lighting schemes. In ground floor, there were people chanting mantras etc. Lot of small buddha idols with Indian names. I was pleasently surprised. This temple is in China town in singapore. It has floors too."
,,A must see,5.0,,"Take a trip to China Town to this delightful temple. Every floor is filled with wonder. The main downstairs area is resplendant in gold, red and giant buddha statues. If you're very lucky the monks may be having a little chant. Whilst the roof garden with its' giant prayer wheel and orchids makes for a great place to reflect and unwind in a busy city."
,,A pleasant surprise.,4.0,,"Throughout Asia there are countless temples and it is easy to get a little blasé. This temple is modest in size,but beautifully maintained. It is bright and serene with a lovely rooftop garden surrounding the prayer wheel. The centerpiece surrounding the relic is a riot of golden splendor."
,,Impressive temple,5.0,,A busy but inpressive temple housing the budda. A service taking place was very interesting and tourists welcome to observe and wander.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Having lived in Asia for about 6 years, I thought I would be templed out, but this place is right up there. Looks stunning on the outside and just as beautiful as you travel up the different floors. I could spend all afternoon reading the statues and stories of the different buddhas. Very crowded on the inside, especially the ground floor."
,,Beautiful and peaceful temple!,4.0,,"We visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple based on positive reviews here on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. The pagoda was architecturally stunning and it's easily accessible being located in Chinatown. Admission is free of charge but any amount of donation is appreciated.

There was a chanting ceremony going on at the time when we visited and so we decided not to go inside the main (1st) floor. Each floor has it's own exhibit. We especially enjoyed seeing the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic Chamber located on the 4th floor. It was a serene and quiet chamber, where many devotees meditate. It was beautifully decorated especially the ceiling - really stunning chamber!

As this is a sacred place where people meditate, there are several policies/rules that one must observe such as wearing appropriate attire (no bare backs, off-shoulders, shorts, mini-skirts, etc.), removing footwear before entering certain areas of the temple, no food and beverage allowed within the museum premises, flash photography is not allowed on certain areas, no photography is allowed at the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic Chamber,etc.. Detailed info can be found at the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple website."
,,reverential,4.0,,This is a very respectful place. The workers were very friendly and inviting and encouraged us to explore the 4 levels of this temple. It is well organised with great explanation of many buddist ideas.
,,interesting but i felt like i was intruding,3.0,,I found it really interesting and peaceful but i was made to feel like i was an annoying intruder by the way i was treated. I get that some people are disrespectful in these places but i am not and it was a shame that something i have a genuine interest in and respect for was almost ruined for me. But i am glad i went!
,,Beautiful Pagoda,5.0,,It was the 2nd time I'd been here. Just had to come back and visiit again. This is my favorite site to see in Singapore.
,,Stunning,4.0,,The inner areas of this temple are magnificent and wonderful to have had the opportunity to appreciate
,,Stunning temple to visit,4.0,,This temple is truly lush with it's rich & evocative golden & red interior decorations but I couldn't quite get to grips with the many artifacts that were on show & available to buy at a price! I came out thinking you could buy your way to Buddhism!!
,,To see different types of cultures,5.0,,"The place is very different. Specially for me, who is from other type of culture. We can see how the Buddhist is... how they pray.. It's a very interesting thing to do."
,,Go there and feel the mistyc of Buddism.,5.0,,Great experience to visit the temple during cerimony.
,,"Really pretty temple, definately worth a visit!",5.0,,"We went in when they were actually doing prayers. All the seats were full and everyone was reciting the sutra in the middle, and we were able to walk past along the sides & even take pictures. And in one area there were different statues for each animal of the Chinese calander & you can buy little books to learn about your animal/god."
,,Wear appropriate clothes,4.0,,"I wore a singlet and shorts and thet initially refused me entry. They have a box full of scarves and other material to cover up, but I would hate to think how many sweaty bodies they have been on during the day, or if they get washed.
When I went there was a 'service' occuring, so it was beautiful to see, but i felt as though I was intruding on their spirital trek."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,Very impressive temples and location are good so its easy to find.
,,Great Addition to the Chinatown Scene,5.0,,"The Tooth Temple opened in 2008 and is a great addition to Chinatown. The main floor features a big prayer hall on the South Bridge St. side, dominated by a huge staute of Maitreya -- the Buddha to Come -- attended by two bodhisatvas. When we visited some monks were chanting prayers while a number of devotees sat at tables behind the monks, following along in their prayer books. The chanting was quite hyptonic. The innumerable Buddha statues set in niches along the walls were beautifully illuminated.

Up on the 3rd floor is a museum featuring images, mostly sculptural, of the Buddha, Maitreya and Avalokiteswara (the Buddha of Compassion, aka Guan Yin) from all over Asia. The 4th floor holds the shrine to the Tooth Relic. The Tooth is in a gold reliquary in a room floored in gold tiles, which can be viewed through a window. The area visitors enter to view the Tooth has platforms with cushions for meditation and 12,300 tiny Buddha statues in niches along the wall.

Up on the roof is a pretty garden and in its center is a pavilion with a huge prayer wheel.

Definitely worth a visit, or two or three."
,,A Singaporean Treasure,5.0,,"I enjoyed visiting the floor where the Buddha Tooth Relic is displayed and it was definitely worth the visit, but my favorite attractions were the museum of Buddhism on the 3rd floor and the fifth floor garden which featured the largest cloisenne prayer wheel in the world. The museum featured Buddha and Bodhisattva images from many countries, annotated with the Buddha's story. The garden was a surprise place of peace and tranquility - and I just really liked being able to turn a prayer wheel that large."
,,Morning chants,4.0,,Beautiful temple great to experience the morning chanting service
,,impressive collection of statue!,4.0,,"I didn't have time to look around and appreciate this place. But for my short walk around the museum, it made me shiver! especially for Kan-non statues. I'd like to find sometimes go there again to slowly walk around and meditate for few miniutes!"
,,great,5.0,,feel tranquility inside and the display of Buddhas is amazing
,,Peaceful place in Chinatown,4.0,,"Whether you are a devotee, a tourist or a local (regardless of religion), you are free to enter the place. There are no admission charges. Pictures are allowed on certain floors but definitely not allowed on the floor which houses the tooth relic. Footwear is required at all places but not allowed when viewing the tooth relic.

There are also prayer sessions within the temple.

At the roof level, it is very serene with lots of orchids known as the Dendrobium Buddha Tooth orchid plants. There is also the Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel which was originally a book shelf for the sutras. It has a central shaft so that it can rotate, making it easier to search for sutras.

Dress code to be observed is no shorts/mini skirts or sleeveless. But even if you do wear those in, there are sarongs and shawls provided so just put them on to show respect.

This place is no doubt beautiful, peaceful with greenery at the rooftop and adorned with gold at the fourth floor. At the third floor, there is also a museum if you are interested in knowing more about Buddhism. But if you would like to visit a temple where many Singaporeans go to, it is the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple located in Bugis."
,,A temple of peace,5.0,,"In the outskirts of Chinatown this temple of peace can be found. The history about Buddhism and local tradition is explained thoroughly on different levels. Don't miss the roof garden it is amazing. Meditation is possible in the inside and very very enjoyable.

If you can be there for a ceremony you will be amazed by the monotone choruses.

In the library there are plenty of books for sell, but also interesting introductions to Buddhism for free.

Great place will be back this year!"
,,A Temple different from the rest,5.0,,"One of the temples I frequent very often when I was working in town. This temple is not only a place for Buddhist to make their prayers, it’s like a museum, temple and garden all in one.

Remember to visit the museums at the upper level where you can learn more about the history of Buddhism, and appreciate some of the fantastic Buddhist artwork.

Not to forget, the rooftop garden at the top of the temple, one of the quietest place in the temple. You can relax and enjoy the scenery while getting some peace in town. Don’t forget to walk around the big bell in the garden, they say that walking around the bell is also a representation of reciting the sutra.

After leaving the temple, try the vegetarian at eight treasure vegetarian restaurant just beside the temple’s back entrance (facing the road), for those with a budget in mind, try the organic food along the food street, something equally delicious."
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,5.0,,This temple is one of the oldest in the city. Its bang in the heart of Chinatown and is beautifully preserved. Monks and locals chant hymns all day long and just sitting there fills one with peace and quiet. Its beautiful!
,,Couldn't find the relic,2.0,,But worth checking out the numerous Buddhas. It is close to Chinatown so worth visiting
,,Interesting place,5.0,,Worth visiting this place. There is a huge collection of artifacts from all over Asia
,,To see,5.0,,Very interesting. A ceremony was involved ewith many peoples and very colorfull. Very nice music too.
,,"""Something New""",3.0,,It isn't everyday that we get the chance to enter a Buddhist Temple and I really find the experience quite enjoyable especially I was with my grandson and he somehow imitated what the buddhists are doing when we entered the temple..Nice place to visit!
,,Lovely place to visit,4.0,,"We too were approached by an man wanting to take us around the temple. We were concerned that he was going to ask us for money. He took us to all the areas and was a wealth of information about all of the Buddha's that are there. At the end of the tour he asked us to go with him to his jewellery shop! We just politely told him we had to get to the airport, and he accepted that.
Beautiful temple, well worth a visit."
,,Buddha's Tooth Covered by Pounds of Gold,5.0,,"Great temple, with many beautiful renditions of Buddha. Beware of the Chinese man who comes up to you and gives you a free tour of the temple. After the tour he will steer you to a jade shop,."
,,peaceful atmosphere- a nice contrast to Pagoda street,4.0,,"I enjoyed my visit here. The atmosphere is peaceful and contrasts nicely with other parts of Chinatown. Admission is free although donations are welcome. Photography is allowed, but I felt a little uncomfortable taking pictures in the midst of people worshipping."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,We were 'adopted' by an elderly chinese man outside this temple & from being worried that we were going to be ripped off we went to a real appreciation of this lovely temple & saw a lot more than we probably would have had we gone in by ourselves. It's well worth a visit
,,A challenging experience,5.0,,"Not a place just to go and look, give it the respect it deserves. We met a man outside who was probably an unofficial guide. He took us through every part and we came away very satisfied with the experience."
,,Beautiful and spiritual,5.0,,"I really enjoyed visiting the Buddha Tooth Relic temple and went there on several occasions. As a temple, I found it a peaceful place to reflect, meditate, or simply pause from a hectic day. The museum is fantastic with a nice balance of art, history, and review of Buddhism and its history."
,,His birthday when there !,4.0,,"Great part of China Town, be respectful in these places,clothing cameras etc etc"
,,A standard stop for visitors to Singapore,3.0,,"it is easy to take a seen one seen them all view, but I found it un-remarkable."
,,Nice Temple for a quick visit,5.0,,Impressive new temple with hundreds of gold covered buddha statues
,,"Calm, serene and soothing",4.0,,Learn all about Buddha at the Museum. Wonderful place
,,Well I quite liked it!,3.0,,"Maybe not got the spiritual vibe of Sri Lankan temple of the tooth in Kandy , but if you want a sanitised version less based on religion more based on shopping this maybe it. That maybe completely unfair but that's what it seemed. Beautiful, but new, hardworking and maybe a bit brash......isn't that Singapore all over."
,,"Beautifull outside, boring inside",2.0,,Its is free entrance and it is just a very new temple with some buddhas inside and a very big shop for buying.
,,Good... but a bit on the commercial side for Buddhism??,4.0,,"The building makes you appreciate the art and beauty of buddhism. This whole place is like an art museum with a lot of beautiful colors and histories. However I keep asking myself... isn't one of the key fundamentals about the religion about ""nothing-ness""? The second floor of the temple is also a library / museum with built-in shops offering books as well as souviners."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The day we went there was a chanting ceremony. It was beautiful with about twenty monks chanting and it was such an experience to view the ceremony. Gorgeous colours and rituals.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A visit here is worthwhile,its visually stunning and exudes a feeling of peacefullness. Go up to the roof to see the prayer wheel and enjoy the garden."
,,interesting place in a modern city,5.0,,inside is a very nice atmosphere and on the top of the temple you can find fabulous garden.
,,"fascinating, functioning Buddhist temple",5.0,,"Four stories tall, each full of interesting people and artifacts, with active worship in progress, makes a visit here very worthwhile."
,,Magical,5.0,,Felt so peaceful. was a sunday and many worshipers singing. Girls you need to cover your shoulders but shawls are provided.
,,Stunning,5.0,,A stunning temple that is a must see. They have robes and foot wear that must be worn when entering the temple.
,,Nice Architecture,3.0,,"I have been to a number of Buddhist temples throughout Asia, but this one shows more like a theater than an actual temple. It is quite evident that the worshipers have put a lot of money into this particular temple. To me, it doesn't feel like a temple, but more of a show piece.

Most people will take a walk through Chinatown anyways, so it is worth the visit as entrance is free. You only need 15 minutes to go in and take a look. I think the most interesting draw to this place is the building itself."
,,A bit of a disappointment,3.0,,"After visiting many other temples and enjoying them greatly, this one felt too slick, and wealthy. The ""keepers"" for want of a better word, were not welcoming, and were specially bossy. Thats tolerable if what you end up seeing and experiencing is special, but this did not strike us as special"
,,Amazing Interior and Exterior,4.0,,"Though it gets a bit crowded towards noon and no flash photography is allowed inside the temple, the sights of Buddha images, offerings and the smell of incense inside are enough to feel my senses...the architecture of the building especially the red-tiled roof is equally amazing..I went there twice during my visit to Chinatown"
,,Must see,5.0,,"Singapore is a modern city and like most modern asian cities, there is very few cultural sites in singapore. This is one of the few remaining ones and a total must see. We read about it in our travel guide, but you have to see it to believe it. There are a 1000 golden buddhas in this temple. Each in a different position. Amazing!"
,,Chinese Heritage in a truly multicultrual city,4.0,,Puts you back in time of old Singapore. Also give us a sens of the harmony achieved between the different cultures living in Singapore
,,a must to see.,5.0,,"wonderful and mystic, to be in singapore whitout a visit is a loss."
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple-Singapore,5.0,,"Try and book a tour with a guide who can shed light on Buddhism and the Temple and how it evolved. Well worth a visit, particularly during an actual ceremony involving monks, nuns and local lay persons at the temple."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Service was in progress when we stopped and it was very interesting.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Do not miss this temple, the museum on four flours and the roof garden. This was a highlight of our trip."
,,A Haven of peace in bustiling Singapore,4.0,,"I liked the roof garden and the hall where the relic is sheltered, quiet, peaceful"
,,All that glitters is gold,4.0,,"This is an astonishingly 'rich' temple. We met a chap who was proud to show us around and explain things. We went to the top of the temple where we wlked through a beautiful, peaceful orchid garden and turned the prayer wheel. We also paid to have monks send prayers for us - for a very small fee we wrote our names on paper and popped them into a special box from which the monks then withdraw them and chant prayers. So many Buddha statues including those for each ""Chinese New Year Animal""."
,,Great buddha temple,5.0,,"It located in China town, the temple is very big. they have a lot of buddha statue in there.
if you are a girl and wearing tank top, you must use scarf to cover your body, they have the scarf, just asked them before you go in the temple.

I must say it is a beautiful temple."
,,good place to visit in china town,4.0,,we spent a lot of time here during our afternoon visit to chinatown. was much better than we expected. the main hall view with the buddha statue was breath-taking! they allow photography except on the 4th floor. there is no entry fee. it is located at a stone's throw distance from the hindu temple.
,,Rip-off for Unsuspecting Tourists,2.0,,"This temple was set up by business-minded people to tempt tourists into visiting (and donating) Built a few years ago, it is neither a historical building nor under the auspices of authentic Buddhist organisations. As a true believer myself, I am ashamed of such initiatives."
,,Serene atmosphere,4.0,,The temple has good reviews & had no regrets. You have to experience this place. I will go again when I am in Singapore
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This temple was not mentioned in our guide book, I believe it is newly built, so when we drove by it on the hop on hop off bus we just had to take a closer look. It is amazing. Take the lift to the top floor then walk up to the roof garden and see the giant prayer wheel, working your way down each floor is a marvel. Note that ladies need to have shoulders covered to enter. The area round the temple is bustling and there is a great food court just opposite"
,,A Must Visit,4.0,,"Located in the center of the busy Chinatown area. The temple is absolutely stunning and a must visit for any tourist visiting Singapore. Then best option to get to the temple, I believe, would be to take the MRT to Chinatown station and then a short walk to the temple."
,,great place to go,5.0,,in there have some of Buddha relics.Only holly person can have the relics when they died.So im very greatfull n happy can see the relics
,,Interesting aspect of Buddhism,3.0,,I enjoyed the many different statues of the Buddha and Quanyin but did not understand the apparent contradiction between Buddha's teachings and the luxuriousness of this building???
,,Visit early morning,4.0,,Very open and visitor friendly atosphere. I was alone at 9 in the morning except for a ceremony with participants. Exiting.
,,Stunning.,5.0,,"Amazing temple right in the centre of shopping malls. The Buddhist community are so faithful to this temple, it really is a sight to behold. Don't leave singapore without a visit."
,,No photos allowed,4.0,,"I still wonder what were the wax made food figures on the long tables infront of the temple-some sort of offerings for the Great Buddha I assume. Nice interior,loads of beautiful ornamentations to be seen,and one can attend a prayer as well,if it happens to be there at the right time. The garden on the top of the temple is very pretty too."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Mind boggling amount of imagery. Needs to be seen.
,,What a great collections! Must seen!,5.0,,What a great collections! Lovely garden on the top of the roof! Must seen!
,,Touristy feel.,3.0,,"Okay I should not use touristy feel to describe a temple. Temples are suppose to be holy, spiritually uplifting places. Maybe cos this temple is pretty ""new"" so it does not have the erm atmosphere that you get in really old temples. And I felt the buy this holy candle etc counters pushing you to buy stuff for praying for luck etcetera etcetera is too commercial for my soulful bone. Prayers and donations should be from the heart and as what the devotee can and willing to give. Definitely no zen like feel for me and the tourist clicking their cameras away at the statues was albeit distracting and downright irritating. This is a temple for God's sake not the empire state building. So if you are those tourist that are looking for a temple where they can sit and meditate, there are others where the peace and serenity overwhelms you. But if you just want to understand about Buddha and take good pictures for your album, can't go wrong here."
,,Visit if in Chinatown,3.0,,If you've never seen a temple then this is as good a place as any to start. Not as impressive as some in Thailand but if your in Chinatown then you shouldn't skip it.
,,So many Buddhas,5.0,,one of the best maintained Buddhist temple I have seen in Asia - even had people chanting The Geat Compassion chant - seems to be active.
,,Preview to Chinese Buddhism and history,5.0,,This new Chinese Buddhist temple in China Town is very grand. It is big and very butiful. There are a lot golden Buddha Statues and a golden pagoda which houses a tooth of the Buddha. There are a lot ancient ruins and antiques on display on the 3rd and 4th floors. Great place to understand the chinese culture and history. Be prepare to spend about 3 hours.
,,Beautiful building,5.0,,The building is beautiful. Closest thing to China you will find in SIngapore. It is in the middle of the China town. This is a must visit for western visitors.
,,interesting place in chinatown,4.0,,"While wandering in Chinatown, I stumbled over this place, a small temple but quite impressive. It was worth to be seen, especially because it was the first budhist temple I have ever seen. Don`t expect smth spectacular, but it`s an original place in the all so modern and polished Singapore."
,,a spectacular temple in chinatown,5.0,,"this temple is a 15min walk from my house. i think it is very photogenic and very interesting both inside and outside check out the hundreds of small budhas, these are handpainted and have to be touched up continuously, fabulous"
,,Awesome,4.0,,This is a very serious place and demands reverence. Well worth a visit.
,,Amazing history lesson,4.0,,Really enjoyed learning about the history of Buddhism and seeing these beautiful altars. Such reverence from all who visited.
,,Amazing Temple,4.0,,There was a service taking place whilst we were there but we were still allowed to watch and take photos. Quite stunning.
,,A bit of a rip-off,1.0,,"I thought this was a bit over-the-top, gaudy and too lavish. Felt uncomfortable with the ostentatious decor. Not well sign-posted and explanatory notes were few. Step in if you're curious but it's not worth a repeat visit."
,,Absolutely Marvelous!!,5.0,,"How can I describe this temple? Absolutely marvelous!!!
It was free for tourist.
Its a 4 storey building + roof top rich with Chinese culture.
Beware: Inappropriate clothings are not allowed inside the temple sleeveless, skirts, and shorts (for men). There are sarongs available near the entrance for guest to cover some of the exposed skin.
Must do in Singapore!!"
,,nice,5.0,,"very nice, it is very intresting too see things from another culture"
,,Nice!,4.0,,Good temple near markets. Very popular. Remember to cover your shoulders.
,,"Ladies, make sure to have your shoulders and legs covered!",4.0,,"It's so cool because there is just a Buddhist temple in the middle of a modern metropolis! No one would think in the hot temperatures in Singapore that there is any place where you would need your shoulders and legs covered, alas, this is the place! The first time I went I didn't go in the temple because I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts and was told I needed my legs covered. Meanwhile, if I had known, I could've gone in the first time I visited because they provide complimentary wraps for shoulders and legs. It's cool to hear and see the monk's chanting and to see the awesome Buddhas all over the place (like the wall of 1000 Buddhas!). The actually ""tooth"" is hard to see (2nd or 3rd floor, can't remember) because it's behind glass several yards away. There's a nice book store/ library/ gift shop where you can get more info or pick up some prayer beads. The whole place is very peaceful. On the way out, when you're returning your borrowed shawls, make sure to take the free book entitled ""Anyone Can Go to Heaven, You Just Have to be Good!"""
,,must visit,4.0,,This is situated in chinatown and is free to enter. Very spirtual atmosphere and you can learn all about your spirtual deaity based on the chinese horoscope. Don't forget a shawl or cardigan to cover your shoulders to be allowed entry.
,,Impressive golden temple,4.0,,"It is new, but very impressive temple, which includes section with biography of Buddha, and a place to rest and pray. You don't have to be a buddhist or dresses somehow to get in. A peacefull place for a breal while downtown."

,,A real insight into Buddhism,5.0,,Not only is this brilliantly decorated but the museum upstais provides a lot of historical information about Buddhism. Well worth the visit.
,,This is a little gem of a temple,5.0,,A gentleman asked us if we wanted a tour and took us through all four floors of the temple and museum. He was very informative and gave us information that we would not otherwise have known. The temple and museum are a must see in Chinatown.
,,Nice place to Visit,5.0,,There is a huge golden Buddha statue in 1st floor with a lot small statues. 2nd and 3rd floors are more educational. There are a lot ancient artifacts from different Asian regions. Worth visiting
,,Fascinating insight,5.0,,"This is a busy, bustling working temple that is fun and interesting to explore. The museum is very well-laid out."
,,Excellent FREE site,5.0,,"If you're in Chinatown, this is a great break from the shopping. The temple is huge and beautiful inside and out. You can easily spend an hour here taking photographs and walking around. The best part is that this is free and open to the public."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Well worth the $3 to walk around and take pictures of all the beautiful murals :)
,,Magnificent and serene,4.0,,"We only had time to visit the entrance level unfortunately, as we've heard that there is a lot more to explore in this magnificent building, so we will return at a later date. Although apparently it is not very old it feels like it has been there forever.
The architecture is truly stunning - imposing in that part of Singapore's China Town that has so many small buildings and little laneways.
Inside the main ""hall"" is the large gold Buddah. The atmosphere was hushed, reverent and it felt like being in a beautiful cathedral, which I suppose it is. Thousands of small Buddahs line the walls, representing the Chinese zodiac. The entrance on both sides of the building house Smaller Buddah forms as well.
There is no cost to entering the building, and there does not seem to be limitations on camera use but I felt a bit uncomfortable taking photos inside where people were praying so I have only photos of the outside.
You are asked to dress respectfully and speak quietly while people are at prayer.
It is a beautiful, cool and serene place where the peace seems to wash over you like a huge soft blanket.
We loved it and will return to spend more time in this magnificent place."
,,Grandiose temple,5.0,,"Superb and very grandiose temple smack in Chinatown. I am not a Buddhist, but I love the whole peaceful feel of the place. The whole donation thing is a little over-the-top, but it's worth visiting overall."

,,An Insight to Buddhism,5.0,,The peaceful temple had gave a great insight of what Buddhism is all about. I love the serenity of the place.
,,"Beautiful, not to be missed when visiting Singapore",4.0,,"If you are into photography, this place is amazing but take a tripod. Flashing is no use, it is to big. First floor is the worship area with few golden Buddha's and 1000s of small Buddha's in shrines. First floor is the Buddha tooth relic are (no pictures!), 3rd floor a very nice museum about Buddhism (English and Chinese explanations) and what most people forget is the roof top orchid garden whit an immense prayer wheel. All areas can be freely visited. A must see and do when in Singapore. The temple is built in Tang style which is also very beautiful with its red wood structure and curved roofs."
,,Worth to see,5.0,,"This temple is in China Town. It is quite a beautiful architecture design. Chinese typical red color and roof. We visited it on New Year day and was able to see the religious ceremonial. Solemn process.

Appropriate wear is required to show respect. No shorts, short skirt, slings is allowed. However, the temple have available sarongs at the gate and you can use it to wrap around :) I like this service as it always helps visitors approach to the attractions with proper respects.

You can take photos but only non-flash photography is accepted."
,,Average,3.0,,"Personally find this place just average. It has nice architecture and very clean for a temple and that is just about it. For a place of worsip, I find that it is rather too commercial."

,,Spiritual!,5.0,,You are enveloped in a cocoon of peace and tranquility the moment you enter the tooth relic temple. You can enter from Chinatown or from South Bridge Road (my preferred entrance). The garden on the top floor is worth a visit.

,,Beautiful,4.0,,"New temple, but beautiful. Free and a nice place to spend half an hour wandering around."
,,"History Museum, Cultural Exploration, Beautiful View!",5.0,,"From the outside, the entire building looked impressive but standoffish, however inside there is an entire floor dedicated to art, meditation, and even a floor discussing the history of Buddhism as well as it's future! Access is available for handy-capable individuals, and the roof-top garden/prayer wheel is a must see for a beautiful view. Would love to go back!"
,,Holy place to visit,4.0,,"Demonstrates the contirubution Chinese Buddhists have made to Singapore culture, it is a must see"
,,Golden beauty!,5.0,,"The temple may not be that old, but the splendour they have achieved is timeless. I only wish my photo skills had been up to the challenge."

,,"Strange, exotic, welcoming, and colourful",4.0,,"You have a sense of peace as soon as you enter the Temple. The range of Buddha figures is bewildering, but once you marry up your birthdate with the Buddhist calendar, you really find out who is batting for you in Nivarna!"
,,amazing,5.0,,temple in Chinatown that is an amazing bit of buddist culture. antone can enter and see the buddahs and the exhibits
,,Impresse don' forget to visit the museum on the second floor,5.0,,"A beautifull temple. We had the luck that when we arrived the monks where praiing. This was very impressive.

When you visit don't forget to visit the museum on the second floor. A small but very nice museum that tells you the history of boudisme. The museum is a little bit hidden in the temple and is easily over looked by most of tourists visit the temple. Take the elavator near the entrance to the second floor for a worthwhile visit"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,Love all the coors and the figures there. The smell is something you won´t forget easily specially when you are not living in Asia so you are not use to it. Worth a visit
,,Impressive,4.0,,only years ago it was a clear patch of nothingness. Then they erected a temple and called it the Buddha Tooth. The architectural effort alone is worth commending.
,,Beautiful busy temple in China Town,5.0,,"Beautiful temple, of course lots of other tourists but inclusive and not too uptight. They seem to ""allow"" photography"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Interesting temple, took us a little time to find but worth it."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Beautiful temple, inside and out. Free entry. If the monks are chanting it is surprisingly relaxing and hypnotic. You are allowed to take photographs on most floors except where the relics are kept. On the rooftop there is a peaceful garden with lovely orchids and an enormous prayer wheel.There is a lift available. We visited the temple in 2009 and again in Feb 2012. If we ever go to Singapore again it will be on our list of things to see once more."
,,Nice visit with good history on Buddha,4.0,,"Liked: Free entry, good history lesson on the Buddha; nice artifacts, very clean and cool in museum.
Disliked: Did not see the tooth (it was encased), seems a little commercialized.
Overall: Nice visit to do in Chinatown; will likely take about 1-2 hours if you like history and museums."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The whole place is very well maintained and clean with free entry! So many things to look around and you can get lots of knowledge. Lifts provided and convenient for elderly and disables. Full with rare statues and religious displays. Enjoyed every second of it.
,,Very Impressive,4.0,,"In the middle of China Town there is this big red Buddha Tooth relic temple. ( actually it is also next to Mosque, an HIndu Temple as well as Catholic church,all within 500 meters from each other !!!
Today I was in this Buddha temple where there was a service ongoing with al lot of monks chanting, scents we lit and novices had to walk around the chanting monks. Very impressive atmosphere to be part of."
,,Get to know more about Buddha!,5.0,,"Living in Asia, you are surrounded by Buddhist temples, Buddha iconography and Buddhist monks so I wanted to know more about the religion and history. The Buddha Relic Tooth Museum is not only a temple where you can pay your respects, but you can walk around taking in the incense, atmosphere and history of the temple. My tip would be travel upstairs on the elevator and read about the history of Buddha and Buddhism. I came out knowing a lot more than I did when I went in. In the heart of Chinatown this is a must see place to visit when travelling around Singapore."
,,quiet & peaceful place,4.0,,nice place to have a short break and have a peace of mind. there is a cafe in the temple where you can browse through some of the available books collection there.
,,a temple both for praying and as a tourist attraction,4.0,,"this temple is alwasy very crowded especially during festivals like CNY. alot of people like to go there for worship as there is the buddha's tooth relic inside.

they are rather strict on the dress code that you have to be reasonably covered up (no sleeveless/ shorts).

it is also rather hard to get blessings as it is so crowded and there is a long queue formed."
,,Pretty Temple!,4.0,,"Not sure if it's okay to describe a temple as pretty but it was, especially when decked out for New Year. Just a five-minute walk from Chinatown station, this temple attracts quite a number of tourists even in the early morning. It's near Maxwell food park so it's not the sort of place that you go to and just leave after because there's nothing else to see. Explore the surrounds while you're at it."
,,A must see,5.0,,You definitely should go check this out. Especially if there is a service going on. It really is quite interesting and beautiful. You're not supposed to wear shorts but I always see people doing it and not stopped. Just be forewarned.
,,Very big,5.0,,The temple is very clean and very well-maintained. It is not too hard to go there as where.
,,Check it out in Chinatown,5.0,,"The Buddha Relic Temple is another must do while in Singapore. The building itself is in the Chinatown district just next to the Hindu temple - pick up any map of the area and you will be able to find it no problem.

On the first floor of the temple you will find monks and locals praying. Quite an amazing experience to sit and watch off to the side. Clothing is available for women to borrow for free off to the side if they don't have appropriate dress. After, I recommend taking the lift or stairs up to the 4th floor where to relic itself is. No pictures but it is incredible to look upon the golden stupa within. Quite incredible. The roof is also accessible and holds the 10,000 Buddhas lining the walls as well as a central prayer wheel.

I definitely recommend this to anyone in Singapore and best of all - it's free!"
,,"New building, old relic. Worthwhile visit !",5.0,,"Great overall exposure to the history. There are several floors with various items: pictures of venerable leaders in Singapore, the tooth relic, etc."
,,Buddha Tooth Relic,5.0,,Well kept and presented. Atmosphere was authentic and calming after the bustle outside.
,,In China Town and a Do-Not-Miss Experience,5.0,,"This temple and museum was amazing. I have seen a lot of Temples but nothing like this. Gorgeous, inspiring, calm, great volunteer staff, wonder views from the roof, excellent museum. You can not go wrong scheduling a visit here - but allow plenty of time."
,,Every time I go to Singapore I go to the temple,5.0,,"Wonderful temple, very friendly towards people of all faiths and nationalities.
Everyone must go, very beautifully designed
There is a restaurant downstairs where the poor are fed for free every day
Don't forget to visit the top floor, the orchids are exquisite.
You can have tea and a biscuit in the bookshop area"
,,Peace and Tranquility,5.0,,The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is amazing. Set in the middle of China Town its an oasis from the noise and bustle outside. The downstairs is a 'working' temple with monks and devotees chanting and offering prayers but visitors are welcome to come in and look and take photographs. If you are female then you need to have your shoulders covered and shorts for women are not acceptable. There are sarongs provided though. When you have had your fill of the downstairs area then proceed to level 3. You will be asked to remove your shoes and you enter the room where the relic (in a separate sealed room) is on display. There is a tv screen which gives you a close up view. Remember to look at the tiles on the floor as they are made from gold. Leave the 3rd floor and walk the flight of stairs to the roof where there is a rooftop garden and a large cloisonne prayer wheel. An absolutely beautiful place to visit.
,,Very Beautiful,5.0,,I arrived the temple around 6.30-7.00 PM. The temple is closed. I just take a look at the outside. The temple is very beautiful with the lighting at night.
,,Gets better the more stairs you climb!,5.0,,"The temple is new however it is very impressive and has looks just like the older temples in other parts of Singapore.

The best parts to this temple are on the top floor - the garden and room of 1,000 buddha's is really lovely AND noone goes there so it's very peaceful and serene.

One of my favourite areas in Singapore"
,,Multimillion pound temple complex,4.0,,A huge Buddhist temple complex. Peaceful roof gardens various areas and shrines to be explored
,,Absolutely Fabulous,5.0,,The entire temple was fabulous from the roof to the lowest floors. Very very beautiful. I felt welcome and serene. The prayer wheel and thousands of little Buddhas were very cool. Such a great atmosphere.
,,authentic,5.0,,"It located next to the mosque and hindu temple, in the Chinatown. It has ice garden with wheel of fortune."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Unfortunately we arrived at 8pm and upstairs closes at 7pm, so we only got to see the ground floor. From what we saw of the temple, though, it's stunning and intricately decorated. The staff are friendly and helpful; I had to borrow a shawl to cover my shoulders as I was wearing a strappy dress and the lady who gave me directions to the box was very nice.

We arrived during some sort of ceremony and the whole thing was incredible! Wish we bad time to go back and see the rest of it!"
,,Pretty brash and gaudy but worth a look!,4.0,,A new temple filled with bright colours and gold statues. You need to cover your shoulders and knees but you can borrow sarongs and scarfs at the entrance of the temple if you need to. Definitely worth a look during a wander around Chinatown.
,,A must,5.0,,"Don't miss it. And go to all floors, there is a lift at the side not very visible. In each of the floors you find very interesting things"
,,Great for photography,4.0,,"Very photogenic temple, try and avoid the helpful locals wanting to show you around, take your time and soak up the atmosphere. You can take some great photos, and there are also framed prints dotted around by professional photographers to give you inspiration."
,,a heavenly place,5.0,,"I went so many times to this temple and I will come back again and again, it's a perfect place for mind and soul and you can visit all the impressive museums inside, you can also have a vegetarian meal and don't miss the rooftop garden, it's really beautiful"
,,Magnificient building!,4.0,,"Whether you are Buddhist or not, the building is awesome and you should visit it if you are in the Chinatown area."
,,good place,4.0,,just around the corner from china town well worth a look must place for a camera
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Only had a few minutes here, but a very interesting temple."
,,Can't see the tooth,3.0,,"The temple itself is very beautiful. As like many temples you will be asked to cover yourself if you are wearing shorts or tank tops.

The museum is located on the 4th floor. You cannot see the tooth relic at all since it's behind a glass sitting on a stupper. The fourth floor itself is quite beautiful."
,,Heavenly,5.0,,The temple is one of the things that any traveller must have on their visit list. 4 floors are worth the visit. Plus a view of entire chinatown. tip- Guys and girls in shorts are not allowed and asked to cover up.
,,Amazing...,5.0,,"this temple is so amazing... very beautiful temple, beautiful museum... this is one of the must visited place in spore..."
,,What an experience,5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relix Temple is right in the middle of Chinatown. What an amazing place. No fee to enter, it only takes 10-15 minutes, but it is absolutely worth your while and many photo opportunities. Do not miss out."
,,"Corporate Buddhism, cold and gold-plated",3.0,,"Well, there certainly is a great deal of gold involved in the main shrine. Lonely Planet says 420kg worth and I believe them. And that Tibetan prayer wheel is enormous.

But overall this feels like corporate Buddhism, cold and gold-plated.

I'm am not questioning the piety of the worshipers - how would I know hat's in their heads. It's more the feel of the place. It's a brand-new, multi-story temple that feels like a the office of a large international bank. I guess that's appropriate for Singapore.

But I preferthe atmosphere in Singapore's smaller temples."
,,Lovely Temple,4.0,,"we visited as part of a city tour,great to be able to see an authentic temple."
,,temple visit,4.0,,Very well maintained Buddhist temple .Spent over an hour walking aroudn and reading the the literature on display .Very peaceful setting.Gave a complete insight into the origins of buddhisim and teh values they preach .
,,A must see site in Singapore's Chinatown.,5.0,,I have visited quite a few Chinese temples in Asia but Iwas gobsmacked by the beauty of this Singapore attraction. I spent quite a bit of time here just taking it all in.
,,Authentic Buddhist Experience,5.0,,"Well done, impressive temple with Buddhist museum whit a large number of original documents and artistic artifacts.
Beautiful giant Tibetan Pray Wheel on the top along with ten thousand small Buddha statues and a peaceful orchid garden.
The area is very lively with Chinatown stalls selling anything from souvenirs to durians."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Beautiful temple, lots of interesting history and information. Covered knees and shoulders required.

Well worth a visit, although don't be disappointed that it is a modern building (it has a car park underneath), as it is very beautiful and we found it very calming, especially the highest level in the roof garden. Nice and cool inside the building also as is air conditioned!"
,,A feast for your eyes and senses,5.0,,Visited Dec 2011. What a glorious feast for your eyes and senses. Rich incense offerings by the devout. Soothing rhythmic chanting by the monks. A beautiful rooftop garden and prayer wheel. Go. Learn. Take pictures. You'll like it.
,,Interesting and beautiful statues,4.0,,"Very interesting,however touristy and busy. We went during the middle of the day and so pretty packed.

Wasnt possible to see the Tooth Relic as only open at certain times. Worth a visit to see the lovely statues but be prepared for the busy atmosphere and not that calming"
,,Nice,4.0,,"Nice temple, worth visiting once during your stay at Singapore. Though no sleeveless shirts/tops and skirts allowed."
,,must do,5.0,,"Easy to enter and walk around, so calming, and yet visually stunning. A wonderful experience right in Chinatown. Go right up to the garden also."
,,Very Spititual,4.0,,"A fully working temple that is popular with tourists due to the fact it is so beautiful inside.

Singapore is a great city for both business and culture and I was lucky enough to experience both on my trip there. The tooth relic temple was one of many spitual places I visited and it is well worth spending some time here regardless of your reason to visit Singapore."
,,It was a nice place just to spend some hours,5.0,,"Everytime we go Singapore, BTRT is always a must for our visit. The 3rd and 4th floor are my favorites if you like some quiteness.Full AC on the whole builing was another reason that this can be a stop by for the whole family on a whole day tour"
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"Built in 2008, this massive temple has many impressive rooms. Tourists should not forget to take the elevator to the upper floor since the biggest relic is set in the 4th floor."
,,Simply WOW!,5.0,,"I quite hesitate at first as I don't feel comfortable with places of religious worship as I am afraid to offend anybody. But they had a clear sign that invites people to come in and they also mentioned the do's and don'ts.
Inside, the decoration was just amazing. You must see it to believe it! :)"
,,Peace in the cacophony of Chinatown,5.0,,"One of the most revered places to visit while in Singapore, The Buddha Tooth relic temple takes you into a state of calm and peace beyond the day to day existence. While most people go around the ground floor only trying to cram as many tourist spots as they can, I strongly recommend going up the floors and experience the knowledge and the variety that the museum has to offer. The garden on top is peaceful and tranquil and the entire structure is beautiful to look at.

The best part of the visit was the continuous soothing chants of the devoted which reminds you of your connection to the One above. But if you don't believe, you don;t have to. Even for the inquisitive mind there is enough fodder in the museums to ponder upon."
,,Just a Buddhist temple,3.0,,"If that's your first Buddhist temple, go for it. Otherwise, it has nothing special about it"
,,Was amazing,5.0,,I couldn't believe had huge the Buddha was. I had a picture taken in front of it and you can't see me until pointed out!
,,Must see while in China town!,5.0,,"The temple is beautiful, and the best time to go visit is during service, the chanting with the music will transform you to a different world. If you want to meditate they have a roof garden, as well as on the 5th floor their is an elevated platform where you can sit and meditate. The temple museum is a great add, and displays some old relics related to Buddhism. The book store/library has a diverse collection, and they also serve some great teas and fruit drinks."
,,Buddah Visit,5.0,,Temple was great and although a service was going they allowed us in and even could take photos which was a surprise. Very accomodating religion.
,,Worth seeing as part of your Chinatown walk.,4.0,,"It is an impressive Temple with an amazing golden statue of Buddha. It is open till 7pm each day and has a roof garden, museum, beautiful interior and .... underground parking (as probably the only Buddha temple in the world) ;-))"
,,incredible & amazing place,4.0,,"Outside at a distance, this ppace look just like the ordinary Chinese Temple but if you look closely, you will see the quality, wood work & carving are of magnificently created. All the priceless relics inside the temple are of superb and rare. you have to exprerience yourself, i hardly explain it. It worth to visit."
,,Never seen so many buddhas!,4.0,,"This opulent temple in the middle of Chinatown is well worth a visit, if only to see all the buddhas. The temple is very much operational, but you are free to walk amongst the worshippers in the temple and view some amazingly old relics in the museum sections. The temple is so named because it holds relics of the buddha's tooth.

On the roof is an exquisite garden, and the cafe/shop is well stocked with gifts and books. It also houses a Buddhist library. The choice of teas is also commendable."
,,Truly worth a visit!,5.0,,"Our hostel is near the area so its one of the places we visited first and we were really astonished by the whole place, its architecture, its nice maintenance, solemnity despite of many visitors inside, very nice relics."
,,Amazing !!,5.0,,Simply Amazing... The vibes tat you get from this place is out of this world... be sure to visit the 5ht floor to the gardens..
,,"Temple with beautiful ceremonies, informative museum, and rooftop garden",5.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum was an unexpected find in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown: a five-storey pagoda that's breath-taking both outside and inside. The exterior is colorful and photogenic, like any Westerner's dream of what a pagoda should look like. The interior has 10,000 Buddha statues of all sizes, from enormous golden statues to rows of ceramic miniatures. Tourists are welcome on all five storeys of the pagoda, with free admission throughout; donations are accepted but not solicited.

The first floor has a large, active worship hall where Buddhist monks and followers hold ceremonies throughout the day, with chanting, drums, and incense; tourists are welcome to observe. Another floor is a more intimate worship hall where a relic of Buddha’s tooth is on display, though the tooth itself isn’t much to see; tourists are welcome to observe the ceremonies in that hall as well, and that’s the one room where tourists are required to remove their shoes. Another floor consists of a museum, with excellent English-language signs, describing the life and philosophy of Buddha; the museum is both informative and enthralling due to the collection of statues, reliquaries, and other works of art. The rooftop garden is a serene, hidden getaway with well-maintained trees, shrubs, and flowers surrounding a chamber with a chiming prayer wheel that tourists are invited to spin. Another floor is a souvenir store and bookstore (one of the few places in Singapore that sold English-language guidebooks) with a small café.

Surprisingly, all points of interest in the pagoda are wheelchair-accessible. All floors are reachable by elevator with the exception of the rooftop garden, which can be reached by a stair-chair lift. There are free public bathrooms on the rear side of the first floor.

Most guidebooks rave about the Thian Hock Keng temple, an older Taoist temple nearby, and some guidebooks fail to mention the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum at all. But in comparison, the Buddhist temple has far more to do and see, is better maintained, and is a welcoming place with lively ceremonies and gorgeous art and architecture."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Very interesting and intriguing - visitors made to feel welcome
,,"Beautiful temple, interesting museum",5.0,,"Enjoyed a lot the Museum (free of Charge) where you can get an overview about the history of buddha and visit different statues. Detailed explanations in chinese and english. Temple itself is also worth seeing, go up to the Top for the small roof Garden with orchideas. It also contains a huge praying Wheel. Access via Lift."
,,Very exotic buddhist temple,5.0,,As Theravada buddhist you will be surprised by the chinese style of buddhism. In the middle of Chinatown you will discover a lot of new aspects of the chinese buddhism.
,,Just beautiful! Dont miss the cheap vegetarian meals downstairs!,5.0,,As our hostel was very close to the temple we went twice. The museum is really interesting and the roof top garden beautiful. In the basement the kitchen serves great veggie food until 3 pm. For 3 SGD you get a big plate of rice/noodles and 3 different vegetables of you choice.
,,Very enlightening,4.0,,"If you're wearing a tank top, you need to cover your shoulders. Scarves are available by the door from the front entrance.

We spent a good deal of time here looking at the exhibit on the third floor. Captions of every exhibit is provided in English and simplified Chinese. A concise history of the Buddha is provided.

Photography is allowed everywhere except where the sacred tooth exhibit is located. You also have to remove your shoes in that exhibit area.

On the top-most level is a beautiful and tranquil orchid garden with a large prayer wheel.

Vegetarian food is available for 3 SGD in the basement."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"A beautiful temple with lots of colour, the deep reds and golds were stunning. The ornamentation of this temple is the best I've seen."
,,Simply beauiful,5.0,,"I didn't manage to spend as much time here as I would have liked, and didn't explore the upper floors, but it's a spectacular temple. The decoration is amazing, and I loved going round to find ""my"" deity (based on Chinese birth signs - I'm a monkey). I'd love to go back another time when I have more time to spend exploring and really understanding the temple."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,A very interesting location to come and see. The trip to the roof is the highlight
,,just stumbled upon a peaceful place,5.0,,"Like many other reviewers I didn't go looking for this but just found it on my wanderings.
It is beautiful, in particular the roof top orchid garden. you'll find a beautiful cool peaceful orchid garden with water flowing over stones and fragrant deep red frangipani and a rooftop temple with a giant prayer wheel. Spectacular.
The temple itself is huge and bright. There are several floors and all offer something different. The lower floor is bustling. There are Monks leading prayer and the faithful praying,
and many onlookers. On the upper floors there are more quiet prayer space and the relics and displays….. and don't forget that roof garden. Absolutely worth a visit."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"A lovely temple, very beautiful and inspiring. Worth a visit if you are in china town."
,,Do not miss the chance to catch a glimpse of the rare Buddha Relics!,5.0,,"As I walked in, I could not help being awed by such magnificent splendour. The workmanship is very intricate and beautiful. And the hall is bright with Buddha and Bodhisattva statues of big and small. Going further up, you can see displays and statues and learn more about Buddhism. There is also a small garden on the top floor. Most importantly, I felt very honoured and fortunate to be able to witness for myself the rare Relics of the Buddha. These Relics are actually the remains of the Buddha after His body was cremated."
,,A modern bright temple.,5.0,,"I came across this temple on a walk through The surrounding area. I was looking for something else but as with most things, it's those little accidents that often give us the most surprises.

The temple is open to all. Enter, explore, visit the different floors and learn some of it's history. Enjoy the sights, sounds and smells.

Make sure to visit the shop on one of the upper floors. I know it's a temple and such but it does need money to run (as does anything in Singapore). Looking for something unusual then you can buy ""gold"" coins for your birth year. Ok it's maybe a little commercial but is also something fun and a little bit different.

Of the many temples and such like in the area this is the one that I have been back to. Why? Because I like the atmosphere.

As with all things like this be open minded and give it a go. It won't disappoint."
,,Definitely worth the visit in Chinatown,5.0,,"We were walking around Chinatown when we suddenly ran into this temple. We had no glue what it was, but it seemed impressive, so we decided to check it out. They provide sarongs in case you are not dressed properly. There is no entrance fee, and there is a lot to see.

On the ground floor is the main hall for praying. And the upper levels have a really good museum of various Buddha related artifacts. And the tooth Relic itself is on the fifth floor. On the roof there is a garden with a gigantic prayer wheel. You can easily spend quite a few hours just browsing through it. It really is a beautiful temple, and an impressive museum.

Definitely worth the visit in Chinatown"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"I didn't know about this place before. I was in China Town at that day and still have time before dinner time. So after asking local people about a temple nearby, He told me about this temple. It was so easy to find this temple. My jaw was dropped when I saw this temple first time. It's so beautiful and huge. I was breathless more when entering this place. Luckily, there was a praying activities starting ,too.
I was so blessed with this place and feel this is a highly recommended place to visit!"
,,a stunningly gorgeous oasis,5.0,,"You have to see this place, an oasis in frantic Chinatown. It's huge, it's full of exquisite statuary, it's air conditioned, it's free, it's inviting but most of all it is genuinely calm and meditative. A place to restore the soul and a glory of red blue and gold."
,,One of the finest attractions @ Singapore,5.0,,"We bumped at this temple by luck, and fortunately we saw it. With several floors and a lot of status (and I mean a lot!) with many different sizes and many more to see at this Buddhist temple. (and with no fee to enter).
This is a must-see at Singapore because you can just watch, take some pictures and learn about Buddhism."
,,Absolutely jaw dropping,4.0,,"I had not planned to visit this place intially, but then I just had a couple of free hours and decided to pay it a visit. And believe me, this temple makes for an amazing spectacle. Ornately decorated huge temple, with intricate art all over the place combined with gold plated surfaces and brilliant lighting is very impressive. spread over 5 floors, captures the essence and history of buddhism pretty well. A must see in singapore."
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,3.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum (BTRTM) is a worship place of Buddhist devotees and a Buddhist culture museum as well, located in the heart of Chinatown, Singapore housing the Sacred Buddha Tooth Relic. The architecture, interiors and statuary, are inspired by the Tang Dynasty, an era where Buddhism flourished in China in a golden age of artistic and cultural vibrancy.

If you want to learn about Buddhism history and culture in Asia, this is a right place to come. There are not entry fee to enjoy the museum.

Once I came to here, they held a Buddhist services or ceremony and a lot of Buddhist devotees came to worship for their health, career, or family. Some foreigners also came here to take a look or just take a photo and of course to have experience viewing the Buddha tooth relic."
