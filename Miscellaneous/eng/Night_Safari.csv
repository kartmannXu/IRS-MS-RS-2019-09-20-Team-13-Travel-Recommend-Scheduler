,,Nice experience,3.0,,"Nice experience You can see deers and antilopes eating in one meter distance Also lions, African elephants, rhinos and hippos About 30 minutes Could be much better anyway"
,,Night Safari - Singapore Zoo,5.0,,"It was a amazing experience. without walking on a Tram ride you get to see the animals. The services provided by them is great. I have my disabled dad with us, they took good care of him, one person was with full time and assisted us with the wheelchair and we were given first chance. ."
,,Excellent zoo,5.0,,"Very long day and night at the zoo so many things to do and so many things to see, but the night safari was expensive but nice to see the food and the workers were very helpful as it is a very large zoo"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We opted to do the night safari tour with dinner. We booked through a Tour service and if you don’t want to be stuck for hours waiting in line to board one of the trains at the zoo, you need to do this as tour participants get priority. The views of the animals on the safari was up close and amazing. After wards you can also walk around to view more animals or see one of the shows. Dress lightly as it is even more humid at the zoo than other areas of Singapore. A terrific experience."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,We were amazed by the experience we got through the visit. The walkabout really brings us close to the animals followed by the tram ride and the animal show was amazing. We had fun and my little ones keeps talking about their experience at the safari until today! We will surely come again in future!
,,OMG!!,1.0,,Clearly overbooked. We waited 40 minutes to hop on one of the trams. Trams were leaving with empty seats while I kid you not hundreds of people were waiting. Not very well organised. The show before the tram ride left a lot to be desired... Wouldn’t do this again.
,,NOT WORTH IT,1.0,,we were looking forward to doing this but we waiting for an hour just to get on the tram ride. couldn’t see the animals and the children kept screaming in your ears while people were doing flash photography when it clearly said to be quiet and no flash. For the amount of money paid for a 15 minute tram ride... definitely wanted a refund after it ended
,,"Nice well-maintained zoo, very poor queue management",3.0,,"I want to give this place a higher rating but they definitely need to improve their queue management. We bought tickets via Klook but it took us almost an hour to enter after they've opened the gates - the queue was very long (our tickets were for the 8:15 PM entry). We were supposed to line up for the tram but after being in line for several minutes and seeing how long the queue was, my husband decided that we should just do the walking trail. This turned out to be a good decision. This allowed us to go around the park and see the animals up close. The zoo seems well maintained and has a good selection of animals - very enjoyable particularly for young kids. We brought a stroller for our 5 year old son, so we were able to move him around quickly when he would tire from walking. While we enjoyed the walking trail, I was also concerned during this time if we will be able to catch the tram and see the show before the night was over. After going around for almost an hour to complete the walking trail, we were able to line up fairly quickly for the tram ride. At this time though, we had already missed the creatures of the night show (930 PM show) and the park was nearing closing time (already past 10 PM). From our experience, if you enter at 815 PM, you will not be able to see all the attractions - in our case, we just did the walking trail and tram but missed the show. The zoo needs to manage their queues better, maybe limit the tickets sold so their guests can still get a good solid experience and not feel like they need to be rushing to cover the entire place and enjoy all the attractions. Or maybe they can also adjust the timings so the park closes at a slightly later time and people can enjoy the place better. In terms of customer service, I didn't find the attendants very friendly, some were unsmiling or curt when you ask them questions. Suggest better training for them as well - they are part of the experience."
,,Night zoo priority ticket,5.0,,We took advice and booked a tour with the priority tram ticket and pickup from our hotel. It was great to not to have to wait. The queues were long! We enjoyed the commentary and the ease of getting there and back. Our guide was fun. Would recommend paying extra if you can.
,,Great Experience !,5.0,,"After hearing so much about the night safari in Singapore, I finally have the chance to visit (with friends), and will definitely come back and visit again with my (teens) children.

A night experience that indeed show you a lot about the wildlife, and what they do at night. Taking the tour bus (included) was great seeing all the (nocturnal) animals. We also walked all the trails and got closer look at the animals.

Remember to get there early, as the queues are always long. Do online booking if possible & you can go straight to the gate.

Highly recommended to families."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,I told myself that I should not expect a real wildlife in this small island. But the night safari made me impressed. Very nice place for educating children.
,,A different approach,4.0,,"We visited the night safari as a group of 9. We got tickets on line through a 3rd party which worked as quite a bit cheaper. The safari was good fun, the highlight was the tram ride. Below a quick summary.
Getting there- difficult, give yourself plenty of time. NS is quite a bit out of town and involves MRT and bus (we went for the safari shuttle which is super confusing about how to pay/whether your MRT is valid etc) in the end the nice driver just let us on. getting home... if you can afford it I would advise taxi, bit ques lots of people, general chaos late at night. Once inside we opted to do the tram ride, it was a big que but it went down quickly, good opportunity to see lots of animal up close. After this you have the opportunity to do some walks which were nice and see some shows, which we didn’t see due to time. Overall good experience, well worth doing but be prepared for lots of people."
,,Long wait for not much to see.,2.0,,"Won't be recommending this for a fun night out. Waited for 25 minutes in the line to take a tram around the park only to have the many people behind us directed to another area where they had immediate access to trams while we waited another 25 minutes to get a tram. We finally start our journey through the park and saw a lion, a tiger, some elephants and a few pigs and antilope type. They recorded audio explaining all the time the animals we should be seeing but because of their camoflauge and dislike of light and noise, we might find it difficult to spot them. Really! That would have been good to know before hand. Once the tram ride of about 33 minutes finished, we walked the various tracks to see more of the displays. Again we were disappointed by not being able to see most of the animals. There is also a show where they bring out some animals. This is short but ok.
Won't be coming back or recommending this activity as it is a long hot night without much reward. Also, I found it funny that where there were no signs of animals the tram stopped, and where there were animals in view the tram continued past and it was difficult to take a photo. Hmm."
,,Brilliant experience,5.0,,Feels like a real safari! No visible fences makes it feel like you are really in the animals homes however all still very safe. Bit of a wait for the cars but worth it!
,,"A good zoo but over hyped, not worth the queuing.",3.0,,"Our expectations were very high for the Night Safari, we had been told by travel agents back home what a unique experience it was and many of the reviews on here really hype it up too.

We found the experience to be quite different in reality.

Firstly if you have booked online tickets you need to queue when you arrive to collect these tickets, this was over 20 minutes of queuing for us.

We were then advised to start queuing for the entrance which I was surprised by as we had timed entrance tickets, so we queued for another 30 minutes to get in.

Once we were in we queued for nearly an hour to get onto the train that takes you around to see the animals.

So that was nearly 2 hours stood queuing before we saw any animals. We did have the opportunity to walk around parts first, but the trains stop at a certain time and there were so many people there that we were concerned that we would not get a ride on the train.

The ride was shorter than I expected and we found after that you get a better chance to view the animals by walking around. A lot of the animals, lions, tigers, elephants etc you do see in most zoos in the days time, but there are some when you are walking around such as the sugar gliders that you don't.

When leaving we found that there was a massive queue for the taxis and it was impossible to get a grab taxi to pick is up, but getting a bus a little way from the zoo and getting off we were easiily able to get a grab taxi to pick us up."
,,Iconic Zoo Away fr USA,5.0,,"Great place to visit. Recommend the Night-Safari Get to see many animals with limited light. It's another when you see I'm film or television, you will perk up, and say I have been there"
,,Hmm for me not worth it,2.0,,"Just came back from the night safari, to be honest it’s not all that, I would of rather spend my money on some where else. There wasn’t much animal to be seen, so for me a complete ware of time, money and effort. I won’t recommend this but that is my experience."
,,"A different, and enjoyable, zoo experience",5.0,,"My family loves zoos. We have been to zoos all over the world, and this experience was unique. We have been living in Singapore, so asked around for tips before going. We opted for the 8:15 tickets, which meant we were not in the first wave crowd. It made for a late night, but we went on a weekend evening so no one was sleepwalking through the next day. If you are on vacation, then I think the 8:15 is the best slot. We also did not do the tram first, but instead walked around the entire park first. We took water bottles, and the park has chilled water dispensers for free refills. The whole walk is about 2.5 km, with some up and down hills, but we took about 2 hours to do it. It is crowded at first, but the further you walk from the entrance the more sparse the crowds. We took time at each exhibit, and found the animals in most. It is important to realize that a lot of the animals can only be seen on foot, and there are others, like the elephants, that can only be seen from the tram. A docent, Ziyi, started talking to us at the owl exhibit and really engaged our girls in discussions about the animals. He ended up walking (leading) with us the rest of the zoo, and this really enriched our experience! He was knowledgeable about the animals, and also expert at finding them, and explaining what they were doing.

After the walking tour, we went to the tram, which had no line and was not crowded at all. This allowed us to take pictures in all directions, and really enjoy the tour. I would definitely recommend walking first (even if only part of the whole trail) to avoid the lines - it makes the Tram experience so much easier and better."
,,Animals at night,4.0,,It was interesting to see animals at night - not doing a lot to be fair but there was a range of wildlife to see. Couldn’t get into the Creatures of the Night show as all performances fully booked. Tram ride was a good way to see the zoo but recommend doing the walking trails.
,,Fun!,4.0,,Wasnt sure what to expect if this due to the mixed reviews however I’m glad we went. There was a long wait in the queue for the tram- however it wasn’t too hot and the long queue was moving steadily along. We enjoyed the tram ride and saw most of the animals. The walking trails were really enjoyable- something different for us. Skip the rainforest lumina!
,,Disappointing,2.0,,Be prepared to spend long times in queues when you arrive. Even though this is a timed entry they do not cater for the amount of people arriving. We had to stand in a queue for over 30 + minutes before getting onto the tram.
,,Not worth the admission price,1.0,,Unfortunately we didn't see many animals on the tram tour. Most of them stayed away from the tram path.
,,Great tour - lots of waiting,4.0,,"The night tour is really a good experience as soon as you are aboard their coaches (although they could think about electrifying those - less noise and smell... - but that is a different topic); nevertheless the waiting time until you are able to board one of the coaches is VERY long, thus reducing the fun of the overall action."
,,Fun but expensive,3.0,,"Did the night safari. It was fun, but at the end of the day it was just a regular zoo and not worth the exorbitant price. The descriptions of the animals/exhibits are also much more lackluster than I expected."
,,Fascinating Experience,5.0,,"My traveling companion in Southeast Asia was a zoologist, so we went to just about every zoo in the region. I definitely recommend this one. The focus on nocturnal animals is unique and interesting. You can take the walking trails, which are heavily landscaped and feel like walking through an actual jungle, and/or ride the tram, which gets you closer to some of the habitats. A great experience -- highly recommended."
,,"As far as zoos go, it's a 4",4.0,,"So this is one of the more interesting things to do in Singapore. The lines are long and it is worth paying the $10 for the short line express pass. There is an ok amount of animals, and they put them in areas that that makes it easier to see them. It is however hard to see them. Also, you want to definitely get out and walk so you can get closer to some animals."
,,Unhappy Animals-don't fund animal abuse,1.0,,"I was excited to go on this with my friend Jayne Yeow from KL, Malaysia but I was horrified by the animals depressed, angry demeanour, I'm highly sensitive to animals & children, a spiritual person and I picked up huge anger & abuse-especially The Elephants, it might be exciting to pass an elephant in a train but do you want to fund these intelligent, magical, beautiful creatures being abused/ drugged up/ beaten up as babies & separated from their mothers & made to stand in humiliating manner like a clown on a plastic bucket? The show was so sad I cried.Fund Animal Sanctuaries not Animal Abuse, Zoos that do research to protect nature not exploit it for money.Would you treat your pet like this or your children? Karma, it's going to come back to you.Thank-you.Katie Mabbett"
,,Relaxing romantic attraction,5.0,,"There were Long queues to entry but well controlled and efficient. Staff were alert and professional . The queue moved fast, so no worries. Just be a little patient. Recommended to walk the trails before taking tram to see the rest of the safari. Last tram ride at 1120pm. Do wear comfortable shoes. Recommended for adults, dating couples, teenagers. Not suitable for young kids, as place is quite dark and late, so they will be tired, craggy, which might spoil the experience. Overall, it’s a relaxing romantic experience."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Reading other reviews made it sound like you saw all kinds of interesting animals and sounded all very exciting. However, upon arrival the enclosures appeared very small for the animals inside and the lighting made it near impossible to see most. Whilst the experience was okay and I'm sure kids would enjoy, I cant help but feel the cost doesn't justify the experience."
,,Disappointing,1.0,,Went for the night safari and I think the signs were the most interesting thing we saw. The animals are in very small enclosures and most look very sad to be there. May be fun with kids but not worth the reasonably price entry fee
,,A long wait for a 20 minute safari,3.0,,"We booked the hop on hop off bus service to take us to the zoo for this activity. I was greatly surprised that there were so many people here. From queue up to finish it took us and hour and a half for a twenty minute ride through the zoo! Also there is the hour and a half return trip from town to the zoo. I would recommend if you don't mind queuing but otherwise forget it. Some of the animals were not visible or present and the ones that were were hard to see as they use white light instead of red so your eyes can never get adjusted to the darkness. On a good note, they say your attendance costs go towards preservation."
,,Amazing night zoo experience from Rachel,5.0,,"We arrived late due to mother and children in tow and Rachel at the entrance gates made the whole experience a dream come true! She went over and above.

We were shown straight to the tram and then off the tram to the animal show! This woman is seriously sorted."
,,Not to our expectation,3.0,,"We though the night safari will be a good choice, but we were disappointed. Big crowd and long queue to enter the facility. Are we there too early (7:30 pm) to see more animals as they are more active later at night? Most we saw were deer species, other interesting species were not to be seen. Some places the lighting were too dim to see anything."
,,Hyped attraction and management of large inflow of tourists on weekend is poor!,2.0,,"We visited recently on Saturday night. We had booked the tickets in advance, reached ahead of time, however entry wasn't allowed until 6:45PM for a 7PM slot. After entry, we were guided to Nocturnal animals of the wild show, which didnt start till 7:15 and finished by 7:45pm.
Post that, when we came back to join for the tram ride for the actual Night Safari tour, we saw that there was huge line of tourists in front of us. We felt cheated that in spite of coming well in time, we had to stand so far behind in the queue for the tram ride.
The tram queue attendants were clearly not equipped to handle such large influx of tourist. There was lot of heated exchanges between the irate tourists, who had to wait for 2 hours in the queue and the staff. In between few trams broke down and that resulted in further delay.
Finally, we were able to board the tram at 9:15pm. The concept to see the wild animals in the night in natural like habitat is good, however, the light is dim, the animals aren't always in near vicinity for the people sitting in tram to see and as such it didnt give much satisfaction apart from the nigh time experience of going thru' a man made forest and see some animals in dark at a distance.
If one has seen wild animals on a regular day time safari in open jeep, i would recommend to give this a miss..."
,,PLAN AHEAD for a great visit,5.0,,"With a bit of research and planning, a visit to Singapore's Zoo Night Safari is worth it for a close up encounter to many animals you will likely never see in the wild.

We arrived at the zoo after a long MRT ride during rush hour to the Ang Mo Kio stop, transferring to bus # 138 opposite the MRT station in the AMK (Ang Mo Kio) Hub. This process took about an hour and 1/2. Once we arrived at the zoo we followed the signs for ticketing since I had ordered and paid for the tickets on-line. The zoo was complete chaos. So many people!!! Once we were in the tram line for an 815 pm departure, an employee instructed the crowd to skip the tram line and do the walking trails. He stated that the tram ride was available until 11pm and the crowds would be lighter the later we went. We REALLY should have listened to this advice. The queue for the tram took us 45 minutes to go through in the sticky heat and humidity, surrounded by chattering crowds. Once we got on the tram, the chattering didn't stop until I started saying ""shhhh"" and others caught on. However, we were unfortunate to have one young woman sitting behind us who just couldn't seem to stay silent during the tram ride :-(. BUT, overall the tram ride was amazing, and we saw some exceptional animals, full of activity. After the tram ride, we walked back through the zoo on the trails and this was very special. I do wish that the zoo would do the following:

1) Have written instructions on how to get the most out of the experience, instead of just having an employee shouting instructions into a microphone;
2) Encourage patrons to be more respectful by limiting loud voices and conversations. The animals don't like it and many of us human beings do not care for it either.
3) Increase the message of conservation. The time for casual conversation is over. Our planet is in a climate crisis and human beings are the largest contributing factor.

On a side note, I really appreciated the many water filling stations available by the restrooms. Bring your refillable water bottles to stay hydrated in the sticky heat and try and do your part to not contribute to increase plastic consumption."
,,Disappointed,1.0,,"We booked through online for 8:15pm and arrived half an hour earlier. After getting our tickets at the kiosk machine, we started to queue. It took us around 45 mins in a humid and boring queue before our turn to ride the tram. Each ride is around 20 mins. We were also unfortunate to have some tourists who didn't understand English sitting behind us who kept talking and talking. The ride was going through a dimly lit trail (I totally understand it as this is night safari). But at many spots we can't even see the animals when the guided announcement was talking about that animal. Bottomline is, I don't recommend this visit. They need many more improvements before it is acceptable attraction, like how to manage a more pleasant queue and waiting time, maybe installing some night vision screens in the tram and spread out the booking timing into 3-4 segments per hour so that all the visitors dont have to cramp in at the same time."
,,Loved it!,4.0,,"After waiting so long to get on a tram, we weren’t sure what to expect. But it was fantastic. A great experience. If you don’t have young children, I would recommend walking as this looked even better than the tram. Best part of all the zoo experiences!"
,,Night safari private tour,4.0,,"Before even entrering crowds were mulling and loud and big
We thanked the Gods wed paid extra for the adventure safari
Was worth it just to avoid huge crowds
Huge
Our own guide who was a charming gent whos name started with J kind and informative
Made sure my 70yo mum was ok and plenty of rest
We had priority seating for night show- fun and some cute critters
Then our own private buggy stopping very close to displays and getting personal insight whilst the crowds trundled by
Most animals out and i wonder are they like shift workers
We even got to feed elephants
I do think for the price they could include entry tickets and some chilled water but there are water fueling stations through out
Not amazing
But decent treat yourself fun"
,,"Great concept, but...",3.0,,"Great concept. Good tram ride, but the line was terrible (over 1hr wait, & a lot of people behind us got to go first), crowd control needs some work. Should of walked the trails, then take the tram ride later in the evening."
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"Our family of 4 visited the night safari tonight and were underwhelmed. Our experience is probably in part due to our visiting many amazing animal attractions in Australia. The reaction from some visitors In the crowd was like they had never seen an animal before ...

So in summary it is crowded, you wil que for everything, it is a hike from the city (taxi approx $30 and 30-40 mins each way) and the cost is substantial, if I had my time again I’d give it a miss."
,,"Nice Cool and Safe, wonderful Experience.",5.0,,Worth a visit after the day at the Zoo. Nice Ambience. Nice ride and cool performance and music. I would like to go again.
,,Worth doing,5.0,,"We went to the Night safari on a Wednesday night. We were there early after visiting the river safari, so were at the front of the line when the gates opened. Miss 8 was unwell and didn’t want to go on the tram, so we went straight to see the creatures of the night show. It was very entertaining. We then walked the trails. It was fantastic. There were not many animals that we couldn’t see. We hadn’t originally planned on going but I’m so glad we did. It was worth it."
,,Horrendous queues!,1.0,,The queues for the safari train are ridiculous. Be prepared to stay in a queue for 2 to 3 hours be fore you get on the train.
,,Nope,1.0,,"Massively oversold the number of tickets for the available places!

Been here for over an hour waiting for a tram just to start the tour and still waiting

Definitely one to miss ... in comparison to pretty much everything else in Singapore which has been great."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"An interesting concept where you take a 30-min bus drive with an audio guide to see the nocturnal animals. We couldn't see all the animals, because it was dark and some of them were hiding.
We didn't do the night walk as we were extremely tired after spending the entire day at the park.
The animal show was quite entertaining.
I would not suggest doing both the main ZOO and the night safari on the same day as it might be a bit too much and you will mostly see the same animals."
,,"Natural, calm and peaceful.",5.0,,I had no much expectations with night Safari as i have been to so many national parks and safari's. But my experience with Singapore Night Safari was a little exquisite. We took a tram ride to go through the safari park and see animals. I could spot many animals by luck and all were engaged in their natural behavior. It was peaceful. Fire show was amazing. Rainforest Lumina is a special treat to eyes and shows how beautifully you can play with water and lights.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,Heard it was good. And it was. Unique experience in the hot tropical Singapore heat of evening. Saw lots of unusual animals in a fabulous setting and the walking trails are worth doing. Go for the 8.15 onwards tram entry times...later the time the lesser the crowds. You can do this without an arranged tour. Easy to get to and back to Singapore centre in a cab - 20 mins approx $40. Better than endless hotel pick up and drop off points on a tour that takes you 1.5 hrs to get there...plus your not stuck with a tour departure timetable which frees you up for trial walking or seeing a late show after the tram ride.
,,Good fun.,4.0,,"We had a good night out at the Night Safari. It was poorly organised through the the hotel, and was thus very rushed, but we still had fun. I would recommend going on a bus tour, as they get priority boarding in the tour buses. So it saves you waiting in line for hours. There is no flash photography, so not much use taking your camera."
,,Night Safari Singapore,1.0,,"This was my 2nd visit to Night Safari, it’s was very disappointing experience,
The tram was full of people chatting loudly, The commentating was pre recorded and could not be heard with all the noise, on my first visit some years ago we had a guide
On the tram explaining & showing us the wonderful animals."
,,Animals in Dark,4.0,,"An amazing experience to see the animals at close after the sun sets. When I went the sun didn't set until 7:15 so I couldn't experience the night views from the tram. But went around on foot and could catch the sights of many animals. I went there on a Sunday, so it was super busy. Try to go on weekdays."
,,Many kind of animal that i never seen,4.0,,"I went to this zoo with 3 of my friends. Its a night safari zoo so its open at night. We book the ticket by online and because we dont know after bought the ticket we still need to choose the time, then finally we can go in at 9.15. At 9.30 there was a place for us too see some kind of animal, after that we surrounded the zoo by using the zoo car and after that we went by walk. It was nice experience for us!"
,,Night safari Singapore,1.0,,Way over priced . Ordinary tram ride in a zoo at night showing 2 lions a rhino and 10 herbivores. Totally not worth the money.
,,loved the night time safari,4.0,,"this is a huge and well maintained zoo.
You do need to leave some time to get around the zoo.
The night safari is busy but also an excellent way to see some of the great animals we live with.
The zoo is a distance from the city"
,,Just like an African Safari,5.0,,"Night safari was amazing, I had the best time here. I went on the tram ride, this was just like a real African Safari, this is a definite on your visit and is the best way to see all the animals up close. I also went on some walks which were good, they were well lit and clearly signposted and I got to see even more animals. The only thing I’d say is it was a very hot night and there just weren’t enough places to cool down. I can’t wait to come here again on my next visit to Singapore. I spent about 2hours here so is good to do this with river safari."
,,Good to experience,3.0,,It was extremely bad weather we went to visit so it was very unfortunate that the show was cancelled but overall it was a good visit. We didn't walk around either as the rain was so heavy but got on the little tram around and it was good overall.
,,Different but still a zoo!,4.0,,Got tickets for 8:15 and went straight in to get seats for show at 8:30. (They let you in about 8am). After the show we avoided the tram queue and went and walked the 4 trails (takes about 60-80 mins) and then got on the tram for the tram tour about 10pm. Need to keep in mind that last shuttle from Zoo->Khatib MRT is 10:40pm if you want to use that one. We got tickets for the rainforest Lumina but ran out of time to do this as well this visit. Was a bit of queuing but was worth the trip. Quite a bit of walking and a late night of taking young kids!
,,Night safari,3.0,,"We (family of four) went on the night safari recently. Would not recommend it at this time of year. Upwards of 3,500 people did the night safari that evening and it was very crowded. Saw more from using the walking tracks than riding on the tram. Allowing less numbers in at one time would benefit the experience greatly."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"a new way of visiting a zoo, nice experience. Only problem was the heavy rush & long waiting time. Overall great."
,,Very enjoyable,5.0,,"Probably our favourite of all the zoo experiences in Singapore. Make sure you go for a walk after doing the Tram tour, as there is a few animals that you won’t see from the tram."
,,Night of Incredibles,5.0,,"If you are thinking that the night is lonely n dark, then are you in for a surprise. Come visit the night safari here and you can be marvelled by the lively activities here. From the exciting shows put up by the performers to taking a pee at the activities of all these nocturnal animals, you'd definitely be amazed n mesmerised by them.
Better still start the day at the zoo then visit the rest of the other two amazing parks side by side to it.
You can be assured that it'd be a meaningful n exciting day for you n your loved ones."
,,Singapore- Night Safari,5.0,,One of it's kind... Safari.. must visit for people visiting Singapore..!! Excellent collection of animals altogether in their wild surroundings.
,,Not that great!,1.0,,"So everyone was raving about the night Safari & thought of visiting it myself to check it out. So the first show of animals starts at 7:15pm & gets over in about half an hour. Once u get out to go towards the tram ride, which takes you around to see the other animals at night. The line was so huge that it took us nearly an hour to get on this tram & to our surprise we hardly saw any animals at night. Except for buffaloes, wild pigs & one hyena. So, my suggestion is to skip this tram & walk instead as you can then atleast wait for the animal or look good enough as the tram waits only for a little bit & goes away further so u miss the fun."
,,Long lines not worth the effort,2.0,,"I went to the Night Safari on a Friday night and spent most of the visit waiting in lines. We had a ticket for 9:15pm and got in line to enter the park at 8:30pm. We entered the park at around 8:45pm and waited in line for another 40 minutes to see the Creatures of the Night show. The show was quite engaging, but it only lasted about 20 minutes.

After the show, we sprinted to the tram line, which by then was much, much shorter than when we first entered the park. We saw a good number of animals on the tram ride, but the visibility was somewhat limited since it was night time.

All in all, I did not think the Night Safari attraction was worth all the time spent waiting in lines. I would not go again."
,,Online ticketing problems,1.0,,Tried to save a few dollars by buying the ticket online. Took a while to download the tickets. When we downloaded the tickets which said night safari they didn’t except them at the ticket booth.
,,A bit disappointed,4.0,,"I was thrilled when my boyfriend told me that we are going to night safari. I guess I expect too much about it. Honestly speaking, I did not really enjoyed it. But I was happy seeing those animals that are new to me. If you are planning to visit night safari, it’s better to go on a group tour because they have the priority pass which is less hassle and not going to stay on the queue."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Saw lots of animals on the tram ride - the queue for the tram was however very long - a trial for a children and adults alike
,,Night safari,3.0,,"Very busy and hot, long lines for the tram and a little disappointed with the amount of animals seen. (We had an older family member so chose this mode of transport).On leaving ,the shuttle bus signs in wrong spot so quite a few people missed the next available bus back to MRT , they needed more buses at the end of evening/ closing time. Other family members who walked around the night safari enjoyed though."
,,Had A Great Time!,5.0,,"Wish we had arrived a couple hours earlier, as we didn’t have time to tour the whole zoo. We saw many different species of animals. Several were very interesting to watch. Can’t wait to visit again!"
,,Not too much to see.,4.0,,"Little disappointing. Not too many animals to see - they were either hiding or asleep.
The whole tram ride was very dark. But the commentary in English was good.
Always very busy, so pay the extra for a priority tram ride or you will be cueing behind hundreds of others."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was one of our highlights to Singapore. An amazing place to visit. One of the best zoos I have been to combined with an ability to observe animals at night
,,Did not see much,3.0,,Rained that night. Creatures of the Night show was canceled. Tram tour quite dark and most animals except deer were asleep. Hot dog was good though.
,,Enjoyable!,4.0,,Friends and I went to 9:15pm time slot and it the wait time wasn't too bad at all. The staff were friendly and helpful. The safari was really enjoyable and informative. They care about the animals and the environment. We also saw the show which was entertaining.
,,Good and friendly staff,4.0,,Staff is friendly. There is enough signboard to direct you when to go. There is a lot of taxi around for transportation back after closing.
,,Too crowded,3.0,,Too crowded with many many indian tourists. Super long queue for the only show available. We have to queue up more than 30minutes in order to watch the show. Should increase the show frequency n reduce waiting time as young children cannot wait so long.
,,Could have been amazing,3.0,,We were so looking forward to this. It was spoilt by a really noisy family on our buggy ride. Screaming kids people on there phones. Wish we could have done it again and could hear the narrative about the animals. We recommend people are told to turn off there phones and please be quiet so all guests can enjoy the experience. We did complain when we got off. No one seemed to care.
,,Amazing experience! Highly recommend it,5.0,,"Great experience for kids and adults, seeing animals at night is something that can’t be missed out on."
,,Night safari visit,4.0,,Overall was a great tour n great show. Tram queue too long - we were not told of expectation of how long we are going to wait n what will be ahead of us. Staff quite helpful. Tram tour is good.
,,Choose the time,3.0,,"Our experience was very much affected by the huge crowds, particularly near the entrance. Only saved by diving out of the hordes, thanks to helpful staff, and doing the walking trails first. Unless you have children in tow we would avoid the shows. It was school holidays but research and choose your visit time carefully. The staff were great and helped us several times. So it is not a wild experience but could be fun at the right time."
,,Good experience!!!,5.0,,"Crowded but the staff manage to handle the crowd well. Despite the huge crowd, waiting time for tram ride was not too bad. The experience itself was once in a lifetime!!!"
,,"Waiting, waiting, waiting.",3.0,,"We arrived around 7pm for the 8:15 show. When we arrived, there weren’t any staff to show where the line started, and were wandering around the entrance for about 10 minutes.

We waited in the line for an hour and a half. The line was long because they mixed both 7pm and 8pm groups. When that was done, we went to another line for another hour. By the time we got inside the tour car, we were already tired, and sweating.

That being said, the attractions and animals we saw were amazing and I was able to see new animals I’d never seen before.

I hope to be back as soon as the problem is fixed."
,,Okish and not worth it,2.0,,Day time zoo is better and you see more animals there. The concept of night safari is good but you see few animals only. It's a bit crowded in terms of the people coming here. You might end up waiting for long for the tram. You can just visit the zoo during day time and that's good enough.
,,"Sherin Nafie, Cairo, Egypt",3.0,,"It is a nice experience, but the place was busy & congested. I expected to see more animals though. I believe the regular zoo visit would be more fun."
,,Ok but so so busy,3.0,,"So when I bought the tickets online as part of the 4 parks in 1 deal I chose a time slot. Little did I know the the rest of Singapore would be in at that time aswell !!!

It was so busy it was quite overwhelming. We headed to the night show creatures of the night.. which is cute. But really we should have gone for a walk around first (which I recommend), then head to the show (8.30) then tram ride.

We did show then stood in the tram queue for an hour and still hadn’t got on. So decided to walk... but you don’t see everything on the walk so need to do both! When we got back the queues were smaller.

Nice to see Animals at night but this has a real zoo feeling and money making .. just mobbed with people.
the leopards are in a tiny area and we’re pacing back and forth and looked really sad. People were banging on windows and shouting loudly. But no staff around the trails to keep an eye out.

We headed to the Illumination rainforest walk after this in the zoo part which we absolutely loved !"
,,Don’t bother,2.0,,"We booked our tickets in advance, including two way transfers from our hotel. We had 2 1/2 hours at the zoo, however when we arrived at our designated time the queue for the trams was about an hour wait. So we went off on foot to complete the walking parts. We did it as fast as we could in order to get the team ride in before we had to leave, however the queue was just as long an hour later. So, the walk was nice and we saw a few things but the tram was not possible. The animals at night show was cute, some clever animals there but far too much chatting and not enough animals/information (although what was there was, was good).

I’d say, don’t bother. Just do the zoo in the day, we saw so much more there and did not feel disappointed at all. Such a shame, the night safari is a great concept, but they let way too many people in causing chaos and huge queues, not my idea of a family night out."
,,Great experience for any age,5.0,,We thought we were going for a couple of hours but spent the whole evening. Lots to see and do in unique night experience. Take the tram and go to the show - all worthwhile.
,,Unique and must-do,4.0,,"Definitely a very unique experience of combining a safari experience, with the safety of a zoo and the thrill of the night! The tram ride lasts about 45 minutes and takes you through a series of animals including lions, tiger, hyenas, wolfs, multiple types of deers, elephants and rhinos! We were lucky to see almost all of them, except maybe one. The animals are pretty close to you but some have smaller fences around them or a water stream between you and them.

There are 2 shows that happen, one fire show outside and another interactive animal show inside. The tricky part with these shows is that they are dependent on the weather. At the slightest of rains they can be cancelled. We were not able to see the shows as it was drizzling when we were there.

The safari is very far away from the main part of the city and you will need to dedicate a full evening to do this (a full day if you do the other zoo attractions as well). Also, the price seemed a bit too much keeping in mind that it was more than any other attraction we had gone to in Singapore, except Universal Studios which is a full day attraction! Also, if the shows don't happen, your ticket price still deosn't change.

Worth attending for sure but definitely seems expensive!"
,,absolutely loved the night safari. well worth the trip,5.0,,"The night safari was an excellent way to spend an evening in Singapore . lots of animal to see, staff were friendly and you can do it on foot or on on their open bus."
,,Pulchritudinous. ostentatious,5.0,,It is unlike any zoo experience you will have. especially the moonlight safari . The day is filled with too many exciting things that make you want to spend at the zoo the whole day and more and still want more of it. Live animal shows are equally creapy and exciting
,,"Awful chaos, huge price",1.0,,"It was awful experience. Me and my daughter came to the night safari. It was huge throng there and nobody controlled this. People like crazy animals ran to the huge queue, and after 15-20 minutes they aware that... it's queue to the entrance! First we need to but tickets! Oh my god... Where to find tickets? We asked some manager, she just waved somewhere as if he don't care. Finally we found a ticket counter. $65 ... it's really overpriced.
Then some managers started to drag a queue to different directions, like we are a herd of sheeps. It was really rude, non-professional. Nobody organized the queue, people sometimes just lost they place in queue... so we left without visiting.
People - there are many nice places in the world. You must compete, not just take money"
,,Don’t bother,1.0,,"We went to the river safari and night safari with our 3 kids under 10 and two grandparents. A number of exhibits on the river safari were closed (all the walk through ones) and the giant pandas which were highly advertised were barely visible. We bought tickets to the amazon river cruise which upon arrival at the start of the ride (a one minute walk from the ticket counter) we were informed it would not go ahead due to the incoming storm. It seems pretty clear when selling the tickets a storm was imminent! We were then told we could not get a refund on the boat ride but could get a credit for the gift store. Upon complaining we were allowed to use it towards food. The river safari was largely fish in tanks with a few varieties of alligator and Turtles thrown in. The manatees were enjoyable.
We were booked on the 7.15pm Night Safari which also included a live show. We went through the gate at 7pm and were told the 7.15pm live show was now full but we could see the 8.15pm after our safari - all good. We then got ushered into an enormous queue which we stood in for 45min with our kids and elderly parents. We finally got into the tour at 7.45pm. The tour was 30min long and underwhelming. Upon finishing the safari we were told the 8.30pm live show was full and we could wait for the 9.30pm show. We could not wait around that long with 3 small kids.
It feel as though the zoo has simply sectioned off parts of the zoo which has enabled them to charge 3 entry fees. The much anticipated night tour was disorganised and extremely underwhelming. Spend your money doing something else."
,,Crowds galore,1.0,,"The crowds during the night safari are unbearable. Combined with poor queue management, you've got a recipe for disaster.

You basically book your time, ours was 8:15. I highly recommend you get in line 30 minutes before your time. Then you get in and queue another 45 minutes for the tram.

It's a nightmare, especially when you consider Singapore is known for logistics."
,,Once in a lifetime Experience,4.0,,"An enjoyable experience for all as they have a variety of animals you can view in their natural habitat. We took the 45 minute tram ride around the rainforest and also got a ticket to the Creatures of Night Show which is an interactive experience with the animals. Spoiler alert— they walk across the seating area with owls, for example. They’re pretty punctual with timings too."
,,A private family safari for 13,5.0,,"We decided on a private evening safari after a review on TripAdvisor and friends experience. the cost is extra, but the experience for 8 adults and 5 grand kids was un measurable.Some of the feeding up close was something the children will never forget and the gradparents had never seen. Our escorts we so great it made our night for all."
,,Fantastic,4.0,,A must visit place in Singapore specially when you visit with your family. Nicely managed zoo and informative.
,,Nice tour but long waiting time,3.0,,"The night Safari itself is amazing. It takes 32 minutes, not 40min. The tour is highly recommend, but the waiting time NOT. We didn't expect such a long queue. We booked the safari on a Wednesday at 8.15pm. After the entry was a very long queue for the tram ride. We waited for 45 minutes. This is even longer then the tram ride. You can also walk through the zoo by night. You have 4 walking trails, each takes about 20 minutes. Last entry is at 10.15pm and at 11.45pm they start to kick you out because the zoo closes at midnight."
,,Fantastic Experience,5.0,,"Incredible experience to see the animals up so close in the evening, some of them I could even hear them breath and make noises. Staff very friendly and helpful, for an extra 10 dollars each we got the VIP treatment, skipped the long queues and got straight on a tram."
,,Busy,4.0,,We came with our 2 kids (6 and 12). We bought discounted tickets online the same day and weren't able to pick an entry time until we got up to the zoo at 6.30pm. By then the 7.15pm and 8.15pm entry times were gone so we chose 9.15pm. We hadn't realised at the kiosk that we were selecting entry times and thought it was tour times. When we then tried to enter figuring we'd walk some trails first we were surprised to find out we'd have to wait 2 hours. I think they felt sorry for us and our genuine shock so let us in anyway. There was a huge queue for the tram ride and the show was full so we got a stamp on our hands and came out to get some food. Not the best food but ok. We went back in at 8pm and just got a seat at the creatures of the night show as people had already been queuing and everyone coming off the earlier trans heads straight for the show. The show was ok but nothing great. We did some of the trails and the got the tram at 9ish. By this time there was no queue so if you can wait. Most of the animals are on the right hand side so sit there for best views. We got grab there and back S$22 and S$16. Worth it as it only takes 20 mins and no queuing.
,,"Quite good, but Probably not worth the huge effort",3.0,,"We did this 10 years ago and i remember it being great.
Not so great any more. Crowded, expensive food, the added cost of taxis to and from, but worst of all the chaos to queue and get on the safari itself. Total chaos and an hour of wasted time. I would not be advising friends to bother. The night is just too hard."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,We enjoyed our visit. As expected it was busy but this didn't dampen the enjoyment. We caught the Tram first and then walked the whole zoo. Not many people seem to walk it so it lets you linger longer at the enclosures with less people. The animal show was worth seeing as well. Unfortunately some animal feeding only happens on weekends. The only thing we found that was disappointing was the food on offer. Not that enjoyable. That aside it's a must visit.
,,One Loop on Tram Goes by Fast,4.0,,"Did a night safari with my kids. The lobby area is nice and has a sit down restaurant as well as fast food and some gift shops and an ice cream shop.
The actual tram loop goes by pretty fast. I think we were only on the tram for about 40-45 mins. The rest of the time we walked 2 of the trails. The trails were good and offered better views of some of the animals.
We caught a bit of the fire show at the end just before closing. People seemed to enjoy it and the performers stayed behind to take pictures with anyone who wanted one."
,,Excellent tour of an excellent zoo.,5.0,,The night safari is excellent. The tram drives around at night and the animals are close and clear. We followed up with a leisurely work around after the tram tour and followed it up with a dinner there (many options) and then caught the bus back to the MRT station (only $1 each - tickets at the Zoo ticket counter) then the MRT back to the city for a night cap. If you have kids (and it is great for kids) a taxi back may be a better option (about $35 SGD depending on the size of the taxi - be aware some only take cash!).
,,Don't take the night safari!!!!!,1.0,,"I'm sure this is a fabulous zoo, but unfortunately for the money and time it cost us, we wouldn't have a clue. I would love to actually go back during the day and just walk around at our leisure - my mistake in booking the night safari. It was recommended to us - never again! We pre-purchased our tickets, so we wouldn't have to line up - WRONG! We still had to line up for nearly an hour!!! I thought we were going to miss our start time. We actually had to run when the gate opened. Shouldn't have bothered. The gate opening time, is nowhere near the time you will leave. Add on about an hour and a half of standing in line. There were SO many people, and the line was ridiculously long, by the time you actually get up to boarding, it's a crap shoot where you get. Of course we got the very front row, which is right behind the driver and guide, so hence you see nothing. Most of the animals were nowhere to be seen, or the lightning was so poor you couldn't see anything if they were there. This was the worst experience of an otherwise fabulous trip. On the way out, we thought we'd make it worthwhile by buying an ice-cream. OMG! Lined up forever and paid a fortune. Not at all value for money. I hope our hard-earned dollars went to these animals we never got to see, or I'd really be annoyed."
,,"not the usual zoo trip, for sure",4.0,,"the queue for the tram itself is more arduous than the actual safari. Fast lane people taking their time did not help. Overall it was an enlightening (pun intended) experience-had no idea Singapore had its own elephants!

the inability to take flash photography (understandable) meant I had no pictures to take back with me other than the really overpriced photo taken by the staff. The Creatures of the Night performance later was a good addition (and free) to the Night Safari!"
,,Great for children,3.0,,"We were a family of adults so this wasnt really the star of our holiday. Its ok for kids though. Fire show was was probably the fantastic! Animal show aimed at young kids as they have animals like owls etc. Theres also a very large crowd and queue to the animal show so you have to be quick to grab a seat. Tram ride was average, some animals were too far to see or capture on camera."
,,More than expected,4.0,,"Before I signed up, I was wondering that any animals would show up at night and bug bites in the zoo. We took direct bus from Suntec city for SG $12 round trip. Arrived before 8pm. We were luckily to jump right on the tram ride. To my surprise, many animals showed up and my teenage boys enjoyed the whole ride. Then we continued to see 9:15 animal show. After that, we already ran out of time to take walk in the zoo because we had to catch last bus back to city. For the whole night, it was fun for my family and only one to two bug bites."
,,Don't count on the animal show unless you like to line up,4.0,,"Today my family and I visited the Night Safari. We were very disappointed that both animal shows (8:30 and 9:30pm) were full. We lined up for the first show right after the fire show outside and for the second show at 9:10pm. By that time both shows were full and we left the facilities without having the opportunity of enjoying the shows. I find this very frustrating because it is a non-sense that you pay a ticket, get to the entrance and then need to line-up for at least 45 minutes to get a chance to come into a show. Please take into account that we were there 20 minutes before each of the shows and they were already full.

The rest of the experience was very good. However my kids and I are disappointed from our visit, as were other visitors that could not get into the shows."
,,Little Over Rated,3.0,,"We recently visited the Night Safari . If you imagine Safari to be like Nepal or South Africa then just stop dreaming . It’s a zoo Maintained nicely for the inside tour in Tram to watch the animals having their food . The food timings are Maintained such that all the animals can be visible . The quantity of the animals is not huge . Some countable in small numbers each breed .
We had an iternary of Night Safari after checking out from the Universal Studio .

I would suggest ‘’ This is not at all Must Visit Place’’ Compared to Thailand Zoo this place needs lots of improvement .
You can visit if you have spare time in the evening . Otherwise no need to leave from the Universal Studio early in the evening .
Travel agents have convenient pickup and drop accordingly so they would set this iternary but it’s ok if not visited .
The light show in the beginning and the night life animals show in the last was nice to watch . Full marks to them .
One good thing ... they allow outside food with you .
Tram ride has all the time waiting of 30-40 minutes so keep patience . No need to hurry . All the times mostly same waiting is there .

Hope it’s helpful .

Thanks"
,,Fun,4.0,,"Night safari was quite enjoyable and the kids loved it especially. It is a different experience compared to the morning zoo. It can get too hot though and the mosquitoes are not helping. But overall, was a great experience!"
,,Horrendous,1.0,,This was such a major disappointment. We heard from many people how wonderful this would be. The night safari mostly made me feel sad and angry. I know it is a zoo so the animals are going to be in confined spaces but at night you would think you would have a hard time seeing them. That was not the case as you could see how small each area was for the animals. The animals also appeared to be drugged. I left with a genuine feeling of anger towards how they must treat the animals. Zoos may do some good for animals around the world but it needs to be a thing of the past.
,,Over hyped,3.0,,"Nothing great about it. It's over hyped. It has been marketed well. Animal show was decent and the presenter was good. If knew before, would have given it a pass."
,,Great experience but extremely busy,4.0,,"Reached at the venue on time. Printed off ticket from kiosk. But then there were long queues which takes more than 30 minutes. Finally the cart came and we were on board.

It's a great experience to see animals right close. Don't use mobile or camera flash as it distracts the animals.

Very nice trip which lasts around 30 minutes. The best part is you don't have to walk but long queues spoil the experience to some extent. Otherwise it's a must try with young kids!!"
,,Fun alternative way to observe animals,4.0,,"The night safari is an interesting way to see animals in a nocturnal setting. Very popular, so expect long lines. Singapore in general has quite poor directional signage and attractions do not understand line/crowd management basics, so be prepared for that. The zoo is very far from downtown and transit gets you close but there is final shuttle you need with its own ticket which is challenging to figure out."
,,Not worth the effort,1.0,,My wife and I did the Night Safari visit 2 nights ago... and found it almost a total waste of time. It was a long drawn out night with not particularly interesting animals to view. Ie in our part of the world (New Zealand) we get to see lots of animals... so maybe we were expecting too much. The safari is different to the zoo... I understand the zoo is excellent. But don’t get the 2 confused...
,,Night Zoo way too busy,2.0,,"My wife and I visited the night zoo and was very disappointed by the crowds, the long wait for the tram and the very poor presentation of the exhibits - would not recommend."
,,left after 20 minutes. won't do again,1.0,,"don't waste your money.
we got the night safari as part of the 4 parks deal. there needs to be a cut off for the tickets sold as there is WAYYYYY too many people. we arrived at 6pm from the bird park for the 7.15pm show and line was already huge to just get in and line up again!!!!!
had no time to eat, had to line up, to line up again, to then have people push in front of you anyway? what's the point of the line?
because there is so many people the workers push half the crowd to the trams and half to the show. show was packed to the brim, animals were seen for about 5 seconds each except for the owls and the snake. we had one lady in front of us, who after told many times to remain seated, still stood and filmed the entire show, was told to sit 3 times including from one of the keepers in the show, while doing the show, who had an owl on her arm at the time!!!!! unbelievable.
after the disappointing show (not the fault of the animals whatsoevet), we made our way towards the humongous lines to the trams to get around the zoo. last straw was people pushing, to the point my partner had someone literally put their hands on his back and push him out the way to get infront of him.
stinky, smelly, sweaty people.
so disappointed.
we waited in line for near on 2 hours, spent 20 minutes at the show, and left. had had enough.
don't bother unless you're an NFL player and will tackle and push people out the way to get to the front."
,,Average,3.0,,"Our group of 7 attended the night safari. With plenty of food options available we all had Dinner before our 8.15pm entry. The fire show just before entry was very good and entertaining. After finally entering the zoo we decided to walk around the zoo for a while before jumping on the bus tour as the wait was 45minutes long!! We headed back to the bus after a while when the line was still 35mins long. As the wait was so long we missed a couple of shows. The bus tour was really very good and the highlight was passing the wolf enclosure to have them howling to our hearts content!! After the bus tour we finished up with the night encounter show which was o.k. I’m only giving the night safari 3 stars because there were too many people which meant waiting times were too long and therefore not possible to attend everything on offer. I must disclose that we went during Singapore School Holidays, but a cutoff should still be applied in my opinion."
,,Awesome Experience !,5.0,,"Fantastic ! Awesome ! Super !
A must visit.
Good Place for all age groups.
Now when you plan the visit...remember that the place is always over subscribed. Be it tourist season or not.
So ensure that you do not plan this on a weekend including Friday.
Reach the location early if you have just booked the tickets and not a time slot . Its restaurants and surroundings open by 5:30 pm.
Be the early bird and book yourself a a entry in 7:00 pm show. Other shows are equally good....its just that if you go into the later shows...the public transport on your way back would not be available....although taxis are available all time.

In the park..
Make a foot trip first as most people will gather for the tram trail.
Then do the tram trail.
Now there is an exciting Animal show ... i think there are three shows on week ends and 2 on week days....8:30, 9:30 & 10:30 pm. Walking trail will take an hour and tram trail will take 45-50 mins.
So plan accordingly."
,,Interesting but very busy,3.0,,There are two parts to this activity - a ride that takes you round enclosures and then the opportunity to walk on paths taking you past other animals. If you can it’s worth getting priority boarding for the tram ride as it lets you skip the queues which can be very long. The tram does not stop so you don’t have the opportunity to stop and observe those animals and the continual movement makes any photography in dark conditions impractical. Having said that there is a fair chance of seeing some great animals like tapir fairly close up. Just ditch the camera for this part. More interesting are the paths where you can take your time and watch the animals. The high point for me was going into a large enclosure and seeing fruit bats just inches away - with no glass or barrier - eating and active. If you want to observe the animals at leisure the paths are less crowded and much more interesting than the “safari” ride.
,,Good for kids and young children,3.0,,A thrilling experience for kids and young kids.Very well organised night ride.But the ques can be long so the earlier the better.The animal shows at the end of the ride was awesome. Worth the visit
,,A little bit boring for a solo traveller,3.0,,"I was originally visiting with a friend but plans changed so I ventured alone.
Being a solo visitor I was directed to take the walk and not access the vehicle that drives around the zoo. This means there is an area that’s not accessible.
Although the walk was pleasant and not so crowded. Many of the viewing areas were too dark to see the animals.
I would recommend to families as lots of children there seemed to be loving it."
,,Great experience!,4.0,,We arrived by the shuttle bus from Khatib at 8pm. We had to queue for around 20 minutes before getting on to a tram but it wasn't that bad. it got a lot quieter soon after so we arrived at the tail end of the peak time. The tour was really good and got very close to a lot of the animals which we didn't expect. It was nice to see so many of the animals so active and there was a great variety. We then took the walking trails after the tram which were also good and got us close to a lot of the animals. Overall great experience and would highly recommend!
,,I love the nightlife!,5.0,,Wow what a great night out. For our final night of holidays we thought we would do something different and decided to do the Night Safari. The rain was beating down as we boarded the bus for the drive out to the Zoo. By the time we arrived and boarded the night safari train (the train will keep you dry should it rain) the rains had all but stopped . During the train portion of our visit we saw many animals enjoying the night air. After the tour we walked all four of the trails and enjoyed seeing many more animals up close. The evening live show had to be cancelled due to the wet weather but this did not effect our evening as we were happy to walk the trails. A great way to finish our holiday.
,,Great to travel at night,5.0,,"The zoo has a night trail that runs for about 1.4KM. You are on a buggy with about 30 other people and are towed past the various night exhibits to see the animals. The white lions are the high light. The great atmosphere gets ruined by flogs use use the flash lights on their cameras.
IF I was running the place, I would be selling a small series of night time photos at the end of the trip so that people would be able to take away a memory of each animal in the night time exhibit.
We had trouble with the maps and the walking trails, especially trying to find the lion lookout, and we were tight for time on a tour, so had to give up on the lookout."
,,Night safari Singapore,5.0,,The Night safari was amazing so much to see and educational. Riding the train is the best part. Make sure you sit near the back at the night show as several times I have seen the extremely large possum on the vines overhead poop into the crowd.
,,Great to see the animals,3.0,,"I found the night Safari a little confusing.
I had to ask for a map when I got my ticket and glad I did.
When you enter you get out on a train for a tour around the gardens. I feel like the right side get most of the higher profile animals.
When that is over, we arrived to hear the 8.30 night creature show was full, which meant I could not see the show, due to my departure time.
There are two walks that they refer to but what you don't realise is you can walk behind those areas. I'm glad I found out (although a little late as I had wandered slowly in first area). Managed to see Tigers before having to rush back to the bus."
,,Enjoyed the night Safari,4.0,,Despite the weather being awful with a torrential downpour when we arrived the Night safari was very enjoyable. The animals seemed more active at night than when we visited later in the week in the day. We spent around hours in total walking the trails and then on the guided tram ride.
,,Too busy,3.0,,Night Safari was good but its too busy. Dont do it with a tour group as you dont get long enough to do any of the walks. It would have been great a few years ago but now there are just too many people and the queues are unbelievable. Theres not much seating unless you are in one of the restaurants. We did a combined tour of River and Night Safari but they dont tell you that you have a couple of hours to kill between safaris where there is nothing to do but sit in the heat. It was a very long day and we wouldnt do it again.
,,Save your money!,1.0,,"The write up makes it sound great, but the reality is something else! We couldn’t see hardly anything and the ones we did see you can see at any zoo! Very disappointed."
,,Excellent and novel animal experience,5.0,,"Don't be put off by crowds- when you are on your tram (~45 minutes) driving through the animals you will be scrambling to spot the next animals on left or right while the English announcement explains the scene. Lots of animals, delicately illuminated in a very natural scene. You don't feel like the animals are caged and trapped.

And after our tram ride we walked around for another hour or two. We would have liked to have also seen one of the animal shows but they seem to fill up 15- 30 minutes before starting and we were too busy walking and seeing."
,,Waiting time,1.0,,"Worst experience in Singapore so far. Chaotic organisation. Extreme waiting times. Do not come here, it is not worth it for that money."
,,A different zoo experience,5.0,,"We have been to zoo's all over the world but decided to give the Night Safari a go, and we weren't disappointed. We travelled with our 4 yr old who loved seeing the different kind of ""night"" animals and we even saw Elepahnts and Rino's.
It took around 30 mins to get a cab from Clark Quay to the zoo and cost 30AUD each way (depending on traffic).

The zoo has a trail you can walk, this is stroller and wheelchair friendly as well as a train that goes to other parts of the zoo you can't walk. Even through there was a large rain storm while we visited we still really enjoyed ourselves and will be back!"
,,Well worth the queue,5.0,,"It wasn’t exactly cheap (but isn’t OTT either), and there was a bit of queuing, but what an experience. The whole layout is designed to maximise the chances of seeing the animals at close quarters, and it works fantastically. Take the tram to orientate yourself and then get off and walk to spend more time seeing your favourite animals. We got up close to the hyenas in particular, and the keeper who looked after them and the servals (whose name, sadly, we didn’t get) was excellent - enthusiastic, very knowledgeable and endlessly patient in telling us all about the animals in his care. Not to be missed."
,,Take a night ride with the wildlife...,5.0,,"This was a fab trip to take at night in Singapore.
The Safari was brilliant and gave us a totally different experience of seeing the animals in captivity. The Safari is laid out over a vast area creating authentic habitats. Taking the small train ride through the different zones is a must and very exciting in the dark with low lighting. We then walked through various zones that gave us the opportinity to quietly wait for sightngs.... There are a variety of food places at the main gate and we finished with a hot snack watching a tribal dance show. A brilliant 5* trip!"
,,"""good""",4.0,,Here you have enough animals. Deers are common. Well maintained. You can see all the animals that they say.
,,Not worth.,2.0,,"We waited in line for a long time for a short tram ride, where most of the animals could not be seen. Not worth for the money you pay. Better to visit the Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"This place opens up around 7.30 pm and finishes around 11 pm.
There are massive queues so important to book on line the time in advance.
You first go see a night show in an arena of various animals / Birds coming out to the Rangers .
After that you queue up for the tramride which takes you through the Jungle type atmospgete and you get to see the animals in their natural environment. Its a unique tramride and you enjoy the appox 30 minutes ride through the Jungle trail.
Would recommend this place.
There are restaurants around to tuck in and have drinks."
,,Up and close to wildlife on the night safari,5.0,,"Had a great time on the night safari getting that close to some of these animals was a great experience especially in a nocturnal scene deffiantly worth checking it out.
I had mine booked via buffalo tours which made it easier to get there with courtesy shuttle bus to and from the hotel.
I had the pleasure of having linda chan as my host who made the trip alot more fum with her comedy and knowledge of the zoo and the singapore area.if you get linda your deffiantly going to like the whole trip alot more!"
,,Nocturnal zoo,4.0,,"Singapore Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo. It is an entire open-air night zoo. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram. The naturalistic enclosures simulate the animals' native habitat. Animals are separated from visitors with natural barriers, rather than caged. Flash photography was strictly not allowed. Cultural performances are a regular feature at the safari, and include tribal dances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. Creatures of the Night Show is a performance presented by the animals in the Night Safari. Found this to be an awesome experience."
,,No so great,2.0,,"After a long long queue it not at all worth for a night safari, we did on tram dont know about the walking trail experience, that was an option too. We don't find any difference between the day nd night one. Actually the day was better with lot to view."
,,"Amazing Zoo, river safari and Night safari",5.0,,"Zoo is very big and it’s not very difficult to cover all Zoo, river safari and night safari in one day. We did it with a kid (7 years old). Since it is very hot and humid during day time in Singapore, We first went to River safari. It is covered with AC so it’s not tiring. We completed River safari till 2pm. Panda was very cute and it was the main attraction of river safari.
Then we went to Zoo which is just next door. Don’t forget to purchase Tram ticket. It’s worth every penny you spend. You can take multiple rides. First we took complete tram ride and saw the entire zoo. Then we got down at every stop and explored nearby area. We could also managed to attend 2-3 shows which was really good. By 6pm we saw almost all animals in the zoo and got 1 hour to relaxed/refreshed for night safari.
At 7 pm we went to night safari. Important note here is, don’t rush for tram ride. First enjoy the show in front of the gate and then go to “Creatures of the Night” show. It’s starting at 7.30 but if you go late, you might not get place to sit. After that you can take tram ride. We took tram ride 2-3 times and finished Zoo+River safari+Night Safari by 9.30pm."
,,A must if you love animals,5.0,,"Took the train and then walked a few trails to see lots of animals up close and enjoyed the show as well. Even went into the bat enclosure to take a look at them up close!

Note that while on the train, some of the enclosures might be a little challenging to see some of the animals, but overall, you can see many of them and even get up close to a few tapirs.

Totally worth a visit at least once if you're in Singapore!"
,,It was good but not as its hyped,4.0,,Its definitely better than any other zoo I have been to. But it didn't amaze me. Probably it didn't live up to the hype.
,,Zoo,5.0,,"This place has a great atmosphere and lively place to come as a couple, with a bunch of friends or your family."
,,Busy,4.0,,"We thought this place was hectic. Everyone clearly arrives at the same time. They need to work out a better glow, as it’s a great product offering."
,,Very mixed feelings about this.,2.0,,"I wish i could give more stars, my lowest review ever.
We booked our tram ride/night safari through a third party and thats where the confusion started. On arrival we were amazed at how busy the entrance was (forgot it was a Saturday night).
The QR code does not give you entry, you still need to get a ticket. Booking time was also nit what we thought.
Waiting in line was unpleasant, super crowded.
Our patience finally ran out and we skipped the tram ride and did our own thing walking the pathways.
Viewing the animals was amazing though i am sure the Tram Ride would only provide a much more limited sample.
As i said, i would love to give a better review but by Singapore standards this was very disappointing."
,,Poor advice from telephone agent,2.0,,"Far too crowded. They need to either increase the ticket price or cap the number of tourists. I have no idea why they don’t offer a discounted ticket to arrive after 8:30pm. Instead we just choose 7:15 like everyone else as it was the earliest - we choose to arrive as we were advised that there is a free ‘fire’ show at 6:45.......are you kidding me?! I was side entertainment (if that) fir a total of five minutes. The person on the phone never once recommended the river safari, which could have easily done in the late afternoon. Instead, we arrived an hourly for the much anticipated fire show! Waste of time! St least the tram ride was good although we still queued for an hour for this. We couldn’t watch the animal show as it was sold out each time we tried to enter."
,,Quite fine,3.0,,"Long queue although there are time slots and rather dark atmosphere, so good for the animals I guess but hard to experience the animals bit better. Chinese people are ridiculous, after 10 times saying not to use flashlight they still do the whole ride."
,,Chaotic line up,3.0,,The trip around the zoo was great and we saw lots of lovely animals however the line up to get on the vehicles was like being at Disneyland. I thought pre-booking would help but no. Go to later sessions if you can.
,,It has changed over the years and I preferred it 10 years ago,4.0,,"It seems like the Night safari is busy no matter whenever you visit. I have visited many times since its opening and I don't think it's as good as it used to be. The Creatures of the Night show featured lots of animals but the one I saw didn't feature the surprise snake which was a shame. The automated voice now on the tram is a real disappointment because other guests don't respect and listen to it like they used to when it was a human speaking and sharing their knowledge. The walking trails have changed as well and I miss the Bridge of Suspense. The Night Safari is still a great evening out, but some small changes I think have meant it's not as good as it used to be."
,,they fool you,1.0,,many problems but to start the place is extremely crowded and the lines are not managed well extreme chaos and confusion .it is impractical to wait so much.if you spend 10 hours there then 9 hours are for waiting.then there is nothing worth your buck and your time if you want to see animals go for a proper safari I would rather search up animals on google than go here extremely disappointing
,,Unique,4.0,,"This is good fun and well worth seeing although it's expensive and over-run with tourists! If only they would keep the numbers down, we wouldn't all be trampled by mainlanders."
,,Excellent Wildlife Viewing - But Go With a Tour!,5.0,,"Book a Skip-The-Line tour - it’s worth every cent! Ours was about $75 pp.
We were collected at our hotel, had an entertaining guide for our approx 45 minute drive to the zoo, and priority at the head of the queue for the tram. The lines to board the trams were horrendous, people must’ve been there for well over an hour at least and were still waiting.
On the tram itself, DON'T sit in the very front seats - much of your view is blocked by the driver.
Views of the animals were pretty good, considering you’re seeing them from a tram at night. The commentary was helpful.
Tip - Don’t waste time & effort trying to take photos unless you’ve got really good camera gear & you know what you’re doing, just put your phone away & enjoy the animals.
However, the nature trails afterwards were the absolute highlight! You have the choice of buying dinner, seeing a show, or walking the trails - I’m so glad we chose the latter!
I had a leg injury from the day before, so I was slow and very careful of my footing, but we did it easily in about an hour. There are four trails, and our guide said each one took about 15 minutes, but they lead into each other, so it was easy to do them all in a circuit.
We got wonderful views of lions, hyenas, fishing cats, cloud leopards, others, porcupines and many more - much better than the view from the tram.
Had a bit of time to spare afterwards to buy food, but we waited and ate back in the city - our bus dropped us off before 11pm, but if I did it again, I’d eat beforehand.
We booked our tour with Viator but there were so many available.
This was my second favourite activity in Singapore, after the Gardens by the Bay.
Well worth a visit, but book a tour!"
,,"Busier then city centre, excessive queuing and no guarantee you will get on the actual safari",2.0,,"I went with my Mum and Step-dad when they came to visit expecting a relaxing drive around the zoo seeing the wild animals. Instead we got a horrendously busy zoo with tons of screaming children and hour long queues to get on the cars driving around.

In the end we just decided to walk because after queuing for an hour to get in we'd have to queue another hour to get on the safari ride. Walking round wasn't great either as most of the animals were scared off by screaming children.

We went on a Saturday so maybe it was a bad time but the safari is sold to you as well a SAFARI which is driving round looking at animals which we literally did not get a chance to do because the park seemed more interested in selling more tickets to make more money than to actually provide a good experience."
,,Fun Night,4.0,,Enjoyed night safari more than normal zoo because it was more animal orientated. Loved the interactive activities
,,A world renowned safari under the stars!,5.0,,"The tram ride was an exhilarating experience as there were animals at both side of the track.
The 4 walking trails around the park provide a different perspective to the safari as there was even a walk, through a huge metal cage where the enormous (bigger than a toddler) fruit bats were enjoying their upside down sleep. It was both frightening yet exciting at the same time.
Very educational and good for people who can walk/trek as there are hilly terrains."
,,A Memorable Experience Not To be Forgotten,5.0,,"I take the liberty to highlight my recent most memorable experience I had at the Night Safari. It was my first day in Singapore and my first ever visit to your beautiful country. I along my brother decided to visit the Night Safari park.

Upon arrival at around 6pm, we were approached by the charismatic Park Manager Mr. Chand who happily informed us that we are selected for a special customer experience. Mr. Chand then very systematically designed our itinerary to suit our convenience, offered us complimentary tickets, applied staff discounts on F&B, presented us a photo frame as a souvenir, reserved our seats at the shows, ushered us through the lines to the front and also arranged a taxi back to our hotel.

I wish we had our families with us as they would be so happy to experience the special customer service. However, I will surely bring them next time we are in Singapore.

Our host, Mr. Chand is an amazing, patient, humble, caring and a great human being. In all honestly, we do not have words to thank him and the park management for such an excellence in customer service. We were delighted to be selected for such an experience that exemplifies your culture of great hospitality.

I have already shared my amazing memories with my family and friends about the great hospitality we were blessed to be chosen for at your Night Safari and likewise in the whole Singapore. I will not forget this beautiful experience for many years to come."
,,Too busy,2.0,,Very disappointed with this visit. We waited 40 minutes for the transfer bus at the train station. On arrival the queue for the safari bus was 45 minutes and never got any shorter. We did the walking safari instead which was OK but missed out the the big animals which can only be seen from the safari bus. Overall the visit was not worth the money and was ridiculously busy to be enjoyable.
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"If you can afford it, book the private tour. Children were so well looked after and we were given special treatment all the way. Got to feed the elephants and had the most amazing night."
,,Enjoyable adventure,3.0,,"The trip was enjoyable. Better than our expectations.

The queues were very long and my young kids were restless. The staffs handle the crowd well.

The parking however is troublesome, non-friendly especially the payment part. The Zoo staffs expect that the visitors who parked are locals and have ready access to the card payment system.

That really spoils the otherwise excellent Night Safari adventure for my family.

Make the parking payment system more (foreign) visitor friendly. Thanks."
,,Very hot weather,3.0,,"The place is over crowded which did not make it easy to travel with kids. The night show is always full, you have to queue 30-45mins in advance before the show. Plus the humid weather.. it wasn’t the best experience. The staff try to be accommodating . The queue for tram ride was at least 20mins, which is also not so fantastic . But when riding the tram ride , it was enjoyable to look at the animals at their natural habitat."
,,Singapore Night Safari,4.0,,"Overall an interesting experience. You do get to see a couple of animals, but, the tram moves and it doesn't stop near the enclosures. we just get a glimpse of the animals. Moreover, its dark, hence one has to really focus your eyes. Secondly, enclosures are on both sides of the road , hence we don't get any clear view on the other side .
Its an enjoyment trip for kids . So, if not doing anything in the evening, take this night safari. Do wear comfortable clothes . There are eateries there , so you can eat after the trip . They do click your photos with an interesting background and sell it for $20 hardcopy."
,,Unique evening experience,5.0,,"Ended up in Singapore as a solo business traveller. Decided to spend an evening at the zoo and very glad I did. Much more comfortable in the evening than the heat of the day and truly unique experience to see the animals at night. The enclosures are so well designed, I often found myself trying to work out how the animals were contained. Well worth the visit!"
,,Not what we expected,2.0,,"We found the experience was not what we expected. Appreciate that bright lighting has the potential to frighten or startle the animals but there needs to be some sort of lighting that allows you to see the animals that the commentary on the tram is referring to. In most cases we felt we were looking at empty spaces. Also my husband injured his leg on a protruding hinge on the tram, which was also hard to see when boarding the tram."
,,Good,4.0,,Good but have to wait in long que to board there cart wait time more than 2 hours strange could have been organised by organizers in better way
,,Beyond expectations,5.0,,"One of the best experiences I have had. The animals were easy to see and suggest that you do the walk around first then jump on the tram.
If you can afford it def go for the private guide tour. We didn’t but will def so that next time."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"A great night time experience, from the animals of the night show, to the exhibits and the walk through enclosures. Well worth a visit with or without children."
,,Night safari,3.0,,Night Safari is very nice. Lines are very very long even with appointment times. The driving tour is a bit strange as sometimes the driver stops at some places and drives through at others. Not very many shows or dining options available but over all quite nice.
,,Nothing much,2.0,,Nothing much to see the animals at the night Safari. I have been to the night Safari some years ago in comparison now the most animals are hidden. It also take a long walk to see them
,,Too many people,2.0,,"We arrived at the 8.15 session on a Sunday night. We thought this would be a quiet night but it seemed to be the busiest night of the week for families! We spent the majority of our time queuing for the show, then getting straight on the train. By the time we got off all the bars and restaurants were closed. So no food or drink and a really long bus ride home. Overall, not great."
,,Very entertaining and great customer service!,5.0,,"It was my daughter's birthday, one of the staff overheard that, gave us VIP access for the shows, tram ride and her very own special Night Safari badge. Have been repeated customers to the Night Safari for more than 10 years, this was very impressive showing how they value their customers. Thank you!"
,,night zoo visit with kids,4.0,,"very nice experience , certainly the walk around in the night is very special and it's great to see the animals in the dark, however some are just sleeping, but overall it's great"
,,Overpriced!,1.0,,"Everything is overpriced with only limited animals but charged with an overpriced entry ticket, even the meals are so overpriced!"
,,My yearly visit,4.0,,I do this at least once or twice a year and my daughter and myself enjoy ourselves all the time. The place remains very well kept and the environment and atmosphere is fantastic. I love the selection of animals and the very natural setting. My only disappointment this time is that some of the enclosures seems to be empty.
,,Happy to visit. Always exciting,5.0,,"Always exciting to visit.
Although, I felt that young children, I had a 4 yr and 6 yr felt bored after a while.
I think that's because they couldn't see the animals in the dark since the trailer taking us is a bit low for young kids to see if an animal is lying down."
,,"Excellent, near perfect",4.0,,"The night safari was excellent. My wife, 4 year old son, 7 year old daughter and I were not disappointed by the animals large and small that were actively walking and eating during our tram ride. Since my kids were rested through the day they could walk the trails to see the other animals like the leopards etc. The only criticism I will give is that the food available outside the park is terribly expensive and of small portions and is a poor reflection on the park. I suggest you look at improving the price, portions and options available."
,,Best in Asia,5.0,,"A must visit park , when you in Singapore . Thank you to Riyan and Chand for the tour and your hospitality. Highly recommended and will definitely come back . Keep up the good work"
,,You could spend several days here,5.0,,We spent several hours and only managed to do two of the safaris without seeing any part of the main zoo. I would highly recommend the River Safari and also the Night Safari. Singapore can be very proud of their world class zoo.
,,"It was heavenly experience , thoroughly enjoyed, loved animals were free and we were in tram",5.0,,"Must for anyone visiting first time with or without children . Well organized, systematic Animals looked happy and healthy"
,,Great,3.0,,"Was a a bit too dark, would be great if it was brighter a little bit more as some of the animal was hard to see. But overall it was great, everyone need to take the tram ride to see more animal =)"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Visited one Saturday night. Went by taxi which cost S$23. We were a bit shocked by the number of people. There was a huge queue waiting to get on to the night trams. Imagine the airport and then quadruple that.
However once we finally got our ride there was a pre recorded audio as we travelled around. It was interesting to see the animals unperturbed being on view in the dim light. We did enjoy this aspect of the visit.
You are also able to walk around some areas. There are lots of food options when hungry.
Plenty of taxis available when you exit."
,,Animals at night,4.0,,A different take from your normal zoo. Our kids had a wonderful time though visually challenging at times when they have trouble seeing the animals but amazed when a tiger suddenly jumps out.
,,Interesting,4.0,,Very interesting trip. We really had the impression of a night safary somewhere in the wilderness. You should plan to have enough time to walk around.
,,"Fantastic night seeing the animals, especially the lions and tiger feeding.",5.0,,"It was a great night visiting the Night Safari. For all our visits to the Night Safari, we usually took the tram in the dark. This time we managed to catch the trim during sunset, watching the animals under the soft sunset, which made the experience much more special.
This is the first time we watched the lions and tiger feeding, getting to see the animals so alert unlike their usual lazy self. The highlight must be during the tiger feeding, the tiger was standing right before our eyes.
The keepers shared many interesting information during the feeding, and they are very friendly to answer any questions. We highly recommend to see the feeding, it only available on Friday, Saturday and eve of public holiday.
Also if you are keen to catch the trim ride, do try to reach the park early and ahead for the tram ride right after entrance. Cause the queue only gets longer."
,,The Highlight of Highlights,5.0,,This place is a must.. there are zoos all over the world...but no other attraction does it the way Singapore does. I've never seen such animals in this type of habit / enclosure. skip the tram ride if you must but the trails are mind blowing. a must for every visitor .. money well spent..and avoid the gift shops if you got kids...the soft toys are irresistible !
,,Night Safari nightmare.,1.0,,"We had high hopes for the night safari. The initial fire dancer show was ok. The night animal show was even alright. The problem is to get into the night safari you must stand around in hours long queue after queue. The lines are so unorganized and unclear that people just cut the lines, plus your packed like sardines the whole time. Utter chaos and frustration. Looking back, we should have gone to just the zoo and skipped the night safari. Not worth it."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,Took the walking trail and saw some cute fishing cats. Took the tram and brought us to some areas only accessible by the Tram. Overall is good. I would really appreciate the tram vehicle could stop for a while for us to take photograph when any animal spotted.
,,A Singapore must!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the night safari. While the line was long for the tram, we were ready to go at the scheduled time. The narration was informative. While staying in the tram we were fairly close to the animals. Saw some interesting species. We did this after a zoo visit where we purchased the tickets together. While we waited for the night safari we ate just outside the zoo. Easy to get there by bus. Unique experience!"
,,Good to do,4.0,,"We did the night safari on our second night in singapore, and booked it through our travel agent which we were glad we did as we got a priority pass for the tram passing a very long queue. This also ment we got dinner before the tram which was OK but we didn't feel too great a few hours after, be wary of the spicy foods. Its a good set up in all, the tram takes you through sections of the park you can't walk through and it's lovely to see animals that you wouldn't in a regular zoo. The tram was also very informative and we got very close to some free roaming animals which was unexpected and lovely to experience. All the animals seem to be well looked after and have relitively good size enclosures from what we could see. The walking bits were also very good, however it did feel a bit crowded at times as some of the pathways were quite narrow and a lot of people were pushing and shoving past. The gift shops were also good, large selection of goods to choose from so it was easy to pick a momento."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,It was Awsome experience to see the wild life. Great place to visit by kids and family. Very thrilling and exciting journey awaiting you if you are planing to go to Singapore
,,Skip night safari,1.0,,We visited the zoo . It was ok. In night safari there was hardly anything new than what we had already seen. Waste of time money and energy. If you visit the zoo skip the safari and go for the cool drink.
,,Different experience,5.0,,"Zoo is always exciting to visit for people of all ages. especially when you can visit the animals walking freely without enclosure in the night, it's d best. You can book on your tickets online or over d counter. It's a tram ride, where you'll be taken to around the zoo. There will be recorded message explaining about the animals as we pass through them. There is no getting down of the train. Entire ride takes about 20-30 minutes. It's an unique experience and kids love it."
,,A wonderful attraction,5.0,,"A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to the Night Safari. The zoo reopens at 7pm, after closing at 5pm daily to prepare for the night safari. Upon arrival we took a 45 minute tram ride around the zoo, viewing the animals at a time when they are naturally most active. Enjoy seeing the animals with the naked eye rather than through a view finder as camera flashes are not permitted and the tram driver does not slow down long enough for your camera to focus. I wasted the first 20 minutes of the ride trying to sort out cameras but it is not worth the hassle. Enjoy the view on the tram as there is plenty of time later on, while walking through the trails, to take photos of the amazing animals. After the tram ride is a show in the amphitheater, showcasing some of the animals in the zoo. The staff continually ask everyone present to not use camera flashes and to not touch or attempt to touch the animals. People still tried to touch the animals but thankfully no one used a camera flash. After the show you will get the opportunity to walk the trails, at your own pace, to view the animals. Here, you can take your time, watch the animals at your leisure and take photos of these animals. This walk is the best part of the Night Safari and is a must if you want a better view.
There are a number of food outlets at the entrance of the zoo and it's best to eat prior to entering.
Enjoy your visit."
,,Well maintained Zoo....,5.0,,A very beautiful Zoo in which you can observe animals during night with their Night Safari...love to be there in future too
,,Totally unmissable - but orgganise yourself to enjoy it most,4.0,,"We absolutely loved the Night Safari! It's an experience like no other - and totally, definitely unmissable if you're visiting Singapore - whether you have kids with you or not. The only disappointing factor was that we didn't realise there are really 3 parts to the Night Safari : A self walking tour, a show, as well as the little bus/tram that takes you around on a tour. We booked our tour time (as we were, & do recommend). We filled in time at the River Safari until the gates opened & then went & had dinner at the night safari (as all food outlets at the River Safari had closed by the time we finished) while we waited for our allocated time slot. What we didn't realise was - we could have been doing our walking tour during this time. Consequently, we wasted time having dinner, then did our bus tour at allocated time, went to show, then had to really rush around our walking tour before the park closed. I would recommend eating before the Night Safari opens, do the walking tour first, then either bus tour or show."
,,Short tireless trip,4.0,,"Best place to go if you are an animal lover who wants a night time experience.
Pros: escape singapore heat
Not much walking(if you choose tram ride)
Short trip ( can be done below 3 hrs)
Creatures of night show a must
Cons:
Short tram ride
You can't always find animals awake or active
There might be long queue for the tram ride,avoid trip during weekends."
,,Incredible!!,5.0,,You buy a packet with the zoo and night Safari. Worths a lot!!! You begin in an open theatre where they do introduction and make a small but interesting performance with the animals!!! There are two passages one by foot and one by train. You have the opportunity to see rare kinds of animals you can't find easily. You should visit it!!
,,Not as good as I remembered it to be,4.0,,I took my visitors there last month and was quite disappointed with the high entrance fee and the downsizing in number of animals on display. The tram ride had done away with the midway stop for visitors to walk among the exhibits. The only pleasant surprise was the addition of the animal show. It’s worth making time to watch.
,,Great. But not as good as I remember.,4.0,,Where the Zoo was even greater than in the past. The Night Safari disappointed somewhat. Al lot of animals could just not be seen. Pity.
,,Animals in charge.,5.0,,"All animals seen tip top and active without any harm by them or any one.
The last show of animals were been great n you can feel them if you can have the courage to touch them. Nature will teach you have to keep nature clean n clear.
Do enjoy the dinner in Ullu ullU Restaurant."
,,Wonderful idea.,5.0,,"First a train ride exploring the whole park with a commentary. Then the opportunity to walk everywhere on dimly lit paths, revisiting the animals you may or may not have seen the first time.
Great experience! Lions roaring, owls hooting, not toooo many screaming kids.
Go for the walk first! The queues for the train are 20 min wait . Walk and come back or train walk and retrain. Every time is different.
Need to tell people to be quiet to help hear the noises of the night."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Great attraction, spoiled to a degree by the pace of the safari itself. Unfortunately, the photo opportunities I'd hoped to experience dissipated because the safari tram traveled too quickly around the circuit, preventing my camera from focusing on the animals in a relative, low light situation. None-the-less, an experience not to be missed."
,,Enjoyable and unusual trip,4.0,,"Unlike many out reviewers we didn't experience long queues or indeed any queues at all. We visited on a Monday evening arriving at about 8pm which may have made all the difference.
Thus we watched the fire show , had a choice of seats at Creatures of the Night ,which was really well done got straight on a tram. I enjoyed seeing animals that are nocturnal up and about.
We didn't go round on foot but that looked amazing. You don't need to be on a tour for this as far as I could see and I expect that you would get a lot out of the night zoo if you did both the foot trails and the tram
I know feelings are mixed about zoos but I believe they play an important role in conservation and education
Worth a visit but seriously consider doing on a week day evening"
,,A totally different experience in the evening,5.0,,"We went to the zoo using our Big Bus two day pass and the bus service is very convenient. We came back on the last bus from the zoo and they compile a list of where people are staying and dropped us off at a convenient location for our hotel. Having visited the zoo in the day, we were surprised at how different an expetience the zoo is at night. We did the tram ride first on the timed zoo entrance ticket and had to queue for about 30 minutes for this ride. We saw quite a lot of animals from the tram ride. Then we walked around the zoo ourselves in twilight which was very enjoyable. There are lots of staff on hand to direct you to the right pathway to see the various animals. A highlight for us was seeing the Pangolin. There are lots of food outlets so you can easily dine there in the evening. Not cheap but worth the money. We were surprised how busy the night safari was."
,,Good for Kids,3.0,,"My rating is average due to earlier I was visited Disneyland Animal Kingdom at Florida USA and Safari World at Thailand. Comparing to both Night safari is little diappointed, but If you not visit Disney or Safari Thailand than its ok."
,,too loud and too short,1.0,,"It looks like a good idea to avoid the daytime heat and visit the zoo at night for a safari ride. The tickets are not cheap, but neither is running a zoo, so it is understandable they want to cash in on their popular attractions.

The train ride itself was shorter than our time spent waiting in line to get on. During the ride, you see various animals that apparently don't need any sleep and are not bothered be the light or the sound of the train. But even if the light seems a bit bright, it is still not enough to take good photos from the train (crazy idea, I know). The fact that the train rarely stops doesn't help, either. Throughout the ride, we saw people walking nearby, perhaps on some guided night tour. These are a lot more expensive, but give you an actual opportunity to see something and take pictures, maybe using a tripod.

I can understand that in order to meet demand, they can not make the train rides longer. Letting people hop on/off also wouldn't work since they would just linger at the most popular spots like they do during daytime. At the end, a hurried train ride like this may be the best thing one can hope for, but that doesn't mean it's good."
,,Cool experience,5.0,,"Night safari was a great experience and was great to see some of the animals up so close. It is very busy but they do a great job of managing the crowds, wait times for the team and entrance were pretty considering how popular the safari was"
,,Great idea,4.0,,We went on a tour pick up to and from hotel. As it was a Sunday night it was packed. Being on a tour put you on the tram ride ahead of the masses. The tram seats 4 across so sometimes difficult to see things. Walk trails were quite good. Saw a lot of different animals.
,,Fun for kids,4.0,,"Night safari is one of those must-do attractions that people all around the world know about. My 13-year-old daughter loved it but it did not blow my mind. It's very well organised - even though it's packed with people - and you do see fantastic wildlife. It just had an air of sterility and fakeness about it. The creepiness of a nighttime tour was fun - a touch of Jurassic Park, we were just waiting for the electricals to fail and the animals to run riot."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Brilliant amount of animals seen considering how dark and late it was. Massive line for the tram ride but was well worth the wait! We had a great evening would 100% recommend if your in Singapore
,,Nice!,4.0,,"An unique experience which Singapore offers! Very crowded on a Saturday night. Filled with tourists from all over the world. You will be expected to take a tram ride, watch show and walk some trails."
,,Do not waste your time going here - we queued for 2 hours 30 minutes before we even saw anything,1.0,,"I bought etickets beforehand - dont bother, you still have to queue to change them into paper tickets! That took forty minutes. We had bough tickets for 7.15 but by the time we had queued to convert them the first two sessions were sold out so we got the 9.15 tram slot.
You are then forced to wait in the ""holding area"" where basically you either go into the gift shops or buy some of the poor quality food. When we were eventually let in, we thought we would watch the night show first but, having queued for 30 minutes a tourguide told us it would be a minimum of a further 45 minutes. So we went to get in the queue for the tram - 1 hour 10 minutes later we got on a tram!!! We went around the enclosures - most of the animals werent there - I would say I had one good view of a lion and that was it - total rip off and the staff are awful"
,,Sad place,1.0,,"Very sad to see the animals in such small enclosures. There was a dead flamingo in one enclosure that no staff were paying any attention to, just ignoring it. Pacing bears..... Please do not spend your money here."
,,Average at best,3.0,,"This attraction has become a conveyor belt, churning hundreds of people through every night on trucks that don't even stop at each enclosure to allow you a good look. You'd be better off walking the trails rather than waiting in the obscenely long queues for the trucks. The only positive part of the experience was the show which was informative and entertaining. If you've been to other zoos around the world eg Taronga, Western Plains etc I wouldn't bother, especially considering the distance from the city and the cost."
,,A NIGHT TO REMEMBER,3.0,,"If you're looking for a thrilling adventure, then you should visit this place. The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram.

THE GOOD PART:
Up close and personal with the wild animals like lions, we actually saw giraffes, monkeys, zebras, and tigers almost a 100 meters away from our tram. But we are not allowed to touch or be near them even if the other animals come near us.

THE BAD PART:
Before we rode the tram we were told not to do flash photography or make inappropriate noise. The wild animals might be disturbed if they hear us if we make some noise, and prowl unto us. I was so scared and nervous the whole time during the ride, because the other guests inside the tram doesn't follow what the instructor told us to do.They were talking so loud and calling the animals by whistle.
It was a fright night for me, an unforgettable experience Indeed!"
,,Highlight of our visit,5.0,,"A must do when in Singapore. The Night Safari is the World's first nocturnal wildlife park. The concept is truly unique. The night safari is next to the Singapore zoo and the tickets are be bought separately as well. WRS runs the Singapore zoo, jurong bird park, river safari and the night safari. U can buy combo tickets for all four or any two/three depending on time available and budget/ interest. We choose the night safari and river safari. The night safari starts at 7.15 , followed by a show at 8.15 till 12 midnight. The Singapore zoo is located away from the main Singapore and takes an hour each way to reach. We stood in line for the 7.15 show at around 6.30 and it was already crowded. The thumbuarkar fire show started at 7.pm( happens at 7,8 and 9 pm except Wednesday and at 10 pm on weekends) but we were unable to enjoy it standing in the queue. The safari is divided in two parts - the creatures of the night show and the English tram ride. We did the creatures of night show first. Had to wait in queues again and did the tram ride later. I suggest u do the tram ride first and go for the show later. There are 4 trails which u can do on foot. The tram is great experience with a commentary on all animals. They also spoke about their wildlife conservation efforts. We definitely learned the lot that day. It is a good idea to buy your tickets online as they are cheaper. U need to print the vouchers and exchange them on the singapore zoo counters for the tickets ."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Great and well-maintained site, fun tram with a nice proximity with the animals, but still you do not see the animals that much in the evening, some are sleeping or hidden in the dark. The major negative point is that you’re paying for waiting in lines. It took almost one hour to get in the tramway. And even when it’s finished, you still need to wait in lines to take a taxi or bus, about 30min of waiting.

Also the taxi to get there doesn’t cost 15-20$, as I heard and read everywhere. It cost us 30$ to get there and 45$ to get back (same place). It is disappointing that public transportation is not very well adapted to get there."
,,Prepare for crowds but still a must-do for animal lovers,4.0,,We arrived at around 7.45 with a 7.15 slot ticket so entrance into park was very quick as we could go to front ahead of 8.15 visitors already queuing. We chose to do walking routes first and they were very atmospheric and we were delighted to be just at the right place at the right time for many of the beautiful animals including the leopard which was a real honour with just the 2 of us at its enclosure at the time. Once we had walked round them all we headed to one of the restaurants at the entrance to eat before the tram and the food was a lot better than we would expect with so many people to feed so that was brilliant. We chose to queue for trams when one of the creature shows was on so it was not as crowded. Tram was a very welcoming seat and commentary was very interesting. Again we lucked out and all of the animals were out and about and viewing them from the tram was excellent. A very well run park with admirable cheery staff - no wonder it’s so busy!
,,Don't expect to see anything if you're seated at the back,2.0,,"We were seated close to the back of the tram. As the tram approached the exhibit the driver would slow down to allow those at the front to get a good long look; for those near the back we stared into bush and trees as the exhibit would not have come into view for us yet. Then, just as those seated at the back finally reached the exhibit viewing opening, the driver sped up and drove off. This was the biggest waste of time and money ever.

In addition, everything felt really staged, as you drive down a single road with a show animals on parade to the left and to the right. I enjoyed the day zoo a whole lot more.

The Night Safari gets one star. The additional star goes to the creatures of the night show, which was charming and highly entertaining.

Some of my blurry photos are attached. The tram was moving too fast to take any proper ones."
,,The tamed animals show,3.0,,"To be frank,I was confused about what they are going to show when they are talking about a night safari (in the midst of a busy crowded city).

To each his/her own,some people may like the place as well,but just sitting in an open bus and looking at those highly trained animals who are standing there,just for visitors to have a look at them ,was not a very pleasing sight for me but again,it's different for different people.

Also,the first show starts at 7 pm,so reach their an hour early if you don't want to end up in a long queue.

There is one more show,where they show the animals running n jumping on the stage, didn't find that entertaining at all."
,,Magical,5.0,,"Impeccably run, maintained park. A genuinely unique and very special way of interacting with wildlife. Take the tram tour by all means, but nothing compares to the magical experience of walking the trails on foot at night, surrounded by lush forest and observing wild creatures up close under moonlight."
,,Unique experience - beware of the timing in the ticket,4.0,,"Night safari is a very unique experience. There are a bundle of things to be done as long as you are prepared to stay late and explore on foot. To start with make sure you are there at the entrance at 6:45 for the Fire show - The fire show was amazing and is free to everyone even without a ticket

Now comes the confusing part. You need to buy a ticket for a specific time. Times available are 7:15, 8:15 etc. We purchased the 8:15 ticket thinking that is for the actual safari ride in the tram and planned to spend 7-8 attending the ""Creatures of the night show"". However, they have a ridiculous policy that they wont even allow you to enter until 8:15. After a lot of haggling, they did allow at 7:30, but we lost precious 30 minutes in this process.

Once inside, a tram takes you around the night safari area and you can see the night creatures (some were not to be seen) After the ride, there are night trails to walk around and you need a minimum of 1.5 hours to walk and explore the jungle night life which is very unique and a must do

The other highlight is the Creatures of the night show - there are some really interesting creatures to be seen and the seats are limited, so make sure that you queue before hand to see this 20 minute show.

Plan to spend around 4 hours (7-11pm). There are plenty of travel options back to Singapore and Grab worked very well for us."
,,I’ve been here three times this was the worst time ever!,1.0,,"Arriving early to attempt to get the 7:15pm tickets
And unfortunately all tickets were booked
So our party of 3 booked the 8:15 show tickets. The most crowded I have ever seen this attraction, 4 hours later done and in cab although the 40
Minutes through the animals habitat was Interesting definitely not worth my time or money."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"A must for singapore, you can not visit Singapore without stopping by the night safari. It’s cheaper to buy the Zoo ticket and the night safari at the same time “however take note” you must select a date that you wish to complete the night safari, once you select the date it is locked in."
,,Something Different?,4.0,,This a different experience visiting a zoo at night. Lucky for us the weather was warm and perfect as you ride in a open tram. We saw most of the animals though with it being so dark some were hiding and some had to be pointed out to me otherwise I would not have noticed them. For a first time night watcher I found the experience exciting and could have touched a deer or two they were that close. My teen also thoroughly enjoyed. We also attended the show afterwards with the animals as we have seen fire shows before. Our ticket included pick up and drop off from our accommodation which was made life easy. Its a late attraction as obviously it has to be dark.. Glad we did it.
,,Overhyped and not worth the trip,1.0,,You won't be able to see alot of the animals as it is dark and these animals are hiding in their habitat.
,,Not to be missed!!!,5.0,,"The night safari is something you may never get to experience anywhere else and is definitely a 'must do'.

We flew from England and arrived in Singapore early evening but this was the only time that we would be able to visit the safari so we booked a taxi and off we went and so very glad that we did! Not only was this the best time to go, approx 8 pm - 9 pm at night, but it was quiet and we managed to do everything.

We did see most of the animals, the key to this is going later at night, when it is quiet, patience, a good eye and most of all keeping very quiet, and if needs be asking other tourist to be quiet, it really does affect what you will see!

After doing the 'walk through' section of the safari we boarded the tram again, no ques just straight on. There is a huge waiting area for people to wait for the trams so I imagine at busy times this could be quite a problem.

The tram safari again did not disappoint it was absolutely brilliant!

I would go back in a heartbeat.

One last thing avoid weekends, unless getting there late as locals often take their children and we were told this is the worst time to visit. I also recommend visiting at night as most of the animals in the 'walk through' section are nocturnal and of course will not be seen during the day. During the night special 'moon lights' are on throughout the walking area so you can actually see the animals, it is not pitch black!

We visited September 2017"
,,An Experience of a Lifetime,5.0,,"The ride in the tram was exhilarating, the night atmosphere was exciting, fortunately there was very pleasant weather and not overcrowded. We saw many and varied wild animals from a fairly close distance which we had not experienced before. There were no scares and took about 40 minutes. The night show after did not stand upto our expectations. We did not walk the trails as it was too late. The tour was very well organised, picked up by a shuttle bus from Khatib MRT station and also dropped back immediately after quite efficiently for $2 pax. Overall fantastic experience."
,,Pointless,5.0,,Couldn't see anything except a few grainy images. Go during the day Nice people though but not really worth the effort to get there
,,Best zoo experience ever!,5.0,,By far the most up close and amazing zoo experience I have ever had. The tram ride through the zoo with an audio guide was great. All of the animals were around and they were so close it was incredible. The walking trails were also good. the show at the beginning was really well presented. Well worth the money we loved it!
,,Great experience!,5.0,,It's amazing how the night safari offers an insight into the animals lifes without putting them in danger.
,,An amazing night for young and old,5.0,,Fantastic experience the bats were fun as was the creatures of the night show. Should be at the top of anyone’s list when in Singapore.
,,Amazing experience!!!,5.0,,Much more than we expected! The staff was kind and recommended best routes/seating for cart ride. We saw animals we usually don't see in other zoos. Indeed a wonderful experience to see animals in their normal habitats - a must see. We will be back!!!
,,Nice experience,4.0,,Everything is nice and detailed guided tour. The atmosphere is great. The guided tour and the show lasted about two hours. May be that’s all? Or I missed something?
,,ONLY FOR KIDS,2.0,,Did not enjoy it much. Mostly for kids and there is a high possibility of you not seeing the main animals.
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"I really love the Night Safari.
The tram can take a while to get on but the line moves quick and it is a great little guide around the park. There's commentary and some sections the animals are free to roam so the deers are sometimes right next to you. The animals are more active during the cooler nights and there's something magical about going through at night. It's just gorgeous!"
,,A bit expensive for the experience,4.0,,If your short on Time or Budget you can skip this park. The best thing about this place is the Fire Show (Thumbuakar Performance) which is held at the entrance so you can just walk in and see it for free. The Creatures of the Night show was decent but the tram ride was a bit boring. Maybe the kids were tired but that didn't enjoy this park.
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,"We went to the 815pm session which was quite busy.
We lined up at 730pm and took until about 840pm until we got on a viewing tram but it was worth the wait.
We were able to see the majority of the animals on display during the tram ride which went for about 40 minutes.
We then walked around the paths to get another look at the animals but the tram ride was better for viewing.
Would definitely recommend this attraction."
,,Lovely evening for all the family,5.0,,"Slightly chaotic at the entrance even though we had timed tickets, but the queues turned out not to be anywhere near as bad as they first appeared. We began the evening with the main show which had audience participation (don't volunteer as an adult unless you like reptiles). We followed up with the tram tour which gave us a good overview of the animals at night - you can go back and walk the route if you wish to spend more time with the residents. We then had supper from a good choice of food court type eateries whilst watching more shows.
Do plan your travel as, although you can easily get there using public transport, it is not a short journey. Taxis are readily available on leaving together with expensive private limousines."
,,Unique zoo experience,4.0,,"As the only night time zoo in the world, we found this to be a unique and enjoyable experience. We took our two children, aged 4 and 6, and they enjoyed it a lot. We started the evening with a tram ride and got to see lions, sun bears, tapirs and deers all roaming at night. We then walked the trails (there are 4 of them) and caught the Creatures of the Night show, which was great. The keepers walk through the crowd with some of the animals (like a binturong) but despite repeating that you are not allowed to touch the animals, some people did which was disappointing.
Whilst it was enjoyable, it was also very busy. We went on a Monday night thinking it would be quieter but it was still packed. We bought tickets via Duck Boat Tours as they included return bus tickets - this was a mistake. They give you only around 2.5 hours at the zoo which is no where near enough. Despite running for the bus we missed it and had to get a taxi back to our hotel. Save yourself the trouble and organise your own transport; there are plenty of options.
Overall this was a unique and enjoyable experience."
,,Not worth the money,1.0,,"Absolute money trap! Masses of people shoving towards the night creature show, but you aren't even guaranteed admission due to the huge crowd they let in. Meaning you have to wait around for half an hour or more in order to get in. That show is the only little bit interesting in the night safari. Tram ride was boring, not much to see. The price is ridiculously high for what you get. The zoo entry durlng the day didn't even count for a reduction."
,,Overall experience,4.0,,"Shows were interesting and eye-catching, however my trip was kind of ruined by other visitors. Will definitely visit again"
,,Great time at the night safari,5.0,,Went with 2 kids 14 and 11. It was well organised and we saw more animals than we had expected contributing to another amazing experience in Singapore.
,,very crowded tourist trap,1.0,,"just not worth the one and a half hours (if youre lucky) waiting in line to get on a tram. ridiculous. they do offer priority boarding but you have to pay lots more. while the audio is very informative, most of the animals cant be seen in the dark. so even if you have priority tickets you will only see a handful of the animals. such a waste of time. and money. and energy. best to skip this tourist trap."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Very interesting and exciting. Night safari is my favourite place in Singapore.
I went there twice, with my son, 19 years old and with my daughter, 22 years old. They came from Japan and I joined to them. They also like Night safari. They went to JBP, Zoo and RS, but I haven't. I must go there also."
,,Moonlight Adventures,5.0,,"The Zoo is beautifully kept, the gardens are gorgeous and the animal enclosures are exceptional driving around in the train and then walking through the zoo at night is a totally different experience to the daytime visit. Everything is quiet and peaceful. its also beautiful and mild as opposed to the hot daytime temperatures"
,,A little disappointed.,3.0,,"After seeing the show, riding the tram and walking around, there was little food available and very unfriendly and unhelpful bus transit staff. Great animal experience, the passion is awesome, lacking in customer service."
,,Evening at Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"We were a couple who wanted to have a different experience. After researching what was on offer we decided to simplify our time down to:
1. Buy a ticket online for 8:15pm to avoid the busy 7:00pm time.
2. Eat beforehand.
3. Did not need to see the show, join the crowds or ride the train. We wanted to walk and explore independently plus more time to take photos and idle at the enclosures that interested us.
4. Wonder around for 2 hours and catch a taxi back to our hotel.

We had a great time and well worth the experience."
,,A great surprise,5.0,,"It was meant to be a birthday surprise for my husband who was a fan of the tiger and sure it was. From the last time I was here when I was 9 till today, it has improved a lot. We chose to go on a Friday night because of the tiger feeding. We enjoyed the talk too.

We ate at the Jungle Rotisserie and was good. However I was hoping for more safari/ African themed restaurants.

The tram was such a delightful ride. It was a good 45 mins that brought you to areas you wouldn’t see by foot - which means there is only about 3 more hours to cover all the shows and every other enclosure. Everything was fast paced even when we entered at 7.15pm (earliest slot). We only wished there was more time to see everything on the walking trails. But that also meant we were enjoying it."
,,Plan your visit to make the most of the park - walk first!,5.0,,"My husband and I went to the night safari at the end of March. We read lots of mixed reviews but had heard good things in person and had the time so decided to go. We both love animals so it was something that appealed anyway.
We booked on the 7pm and arrived around 7.50pm due to work, but this ended up working very well. With 7pm tickets we were able to go straight in. A member of staff advised us to go straight to 'The creatures of the night' show and so we joined the queue. The show started at 8.30 so we queued for 15mins or so before being allowed in. They do prioritise group bookings so you may find that the arena is already quite full when you're let in. As there were only the two of us, we still had a few options to sit together and we ended up being right at the front on the left. Wherever you sit, you will get a good view but being closer does mean that you see some of the animals up close. Others come down the aisles. There were a couple of queue cutters before we got into the arena but on the whole people were polite and orderly which makes the queuing less stressful.
The show itself was great - lots of different animals and delivered confidently by the staff.

After the show make sure to walk around the park. There was a queue for the tram and we had been advised to use it later. As you are standing with your back to the entrance, take a left and walk the park that way. It is much quieter as most people with families try to do the tram early. The signs are very easy to follow and we saw a great deal and even had time alone by some of the enclosures. We went on a Tuesday evening during school holidays!

We probably took about 2 hours to walk around although you could do it faster if you're not too worried about watching the animals for long. There were a couple of areas where you even get to walk through the cages like with the bats.
We got back to the entrance around 10.50/11 and then walked straight onto a waiting tram. We were the only people in our whole carriage and 2 of about 10 on the entire tram. This meant that we heard the commentary fully and had no distractions. The tram journey was longer than I expected and stopped by some of the enclosures so you had time to look for the animals. We were fortunate that we saw lots.
I am always concerned for the animals whenever I go to a zoo as I worry about the space they have and how they are kept. It was reassuring to see that, in general, they had more room and the educational side was strong."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"The guides at the gate and along the tram are kind. However, the warm and humid weather make us sweat quite a bit. Maybe install more cooler fan along the trek."
,,Average,3.0,,Park layout is fine but not many animals were out. We didn't ride the tram and after a few hours my companion was tired. Crowds were not to bad and no wait time to get in.
,,Wow ... impressive,4.0,,"I have grown tired of zoos over the years, especially when the ‘big ticket’ animals seem more interested in sleeping and avoiding the heat of the day.
The night safari delivered male lions prowling, hyenas, elephants, hippo, rhinos, a myriad of deer and other animals ... with the perception that they were all close enough to touch from the comfort of the tram.
Although the tram felt a little rushed and would have been good to be able to ‘hop on, hop off’
Awesome family experience ... even though we were all tired and cranky after a long day of sightseeing."
,,Fantastic Experience,5.0,,Fantastic Experience to visit a ZOO in the dark hours. Must visit place to have an unbelievable experience !!!
,,Night Safari review,3.0,,It was mostly too dark and it was impossible to see some of the animals. Most of them were probably in hiding or asleep. But overall was an okay experience.
,,It’s fully commercialised. I feel terrible.,1.0,,"One entry to night safari is considered as mistake and should not be repeated again. In next 10 year, one will not see trees but will see Super trees - concrete jungle. Horrible."
,,Not up to the expection an hype created.,2.0,,You can not see the animals from tram . Not worth . The other show was also ok as only very small animals were there in the show. Fire show was good.
,,Commercialised,2.0,,The night safari gets such great reviews I think our expectations were too high. It was very Disneyland like and production line processes... “very staged” as our 12 year old put it...
,,Fun for family,5.0,,"Beautiful restaurants, shops and animals. Wear comfortable shoes if you plan to walk. It's hot outside. Bring water bottles or purchase it. Grab is a good transportation to get there."
,,Surreal Experiences,5.0,,Great experience and up close with all animals. Definitely a place you must visit when your in Singapore.
,,Different Experience,5.0,,"This was the first time we visited night safari.
Must say that it was an awesome and a very different experience altogether.
Usually we go to zoo in the day time but seeing animals in the night is totally different especially when there are areas of open zoo where animals are very near to your vehicle.
A must visit place while in Singapore. Kids would love it and so would adults."
,,The shows and the experience were better than expected.,4.0,,When we arrived the fire dancers were just beginning their show. Shortly after they finished the Creatures of the Night show was beginning. After enjoying these shows we felt that we got our money’s worth and we hadn’t even been on the safari yet.
,,"Hyped place, nothing exciting",3.0,,"We went to Night Safari after 12 years and were surprised to see that nothing has changed. Singapore as a country keeps changing, keep adding new excitements and fun activities BUT nothing new in night safari.

There are other better things to do in Singapore at night rather than visiting night safari.

Avoidable place."
,,Great zoo,5.0,,Have to say this is a Singapore ‘must do’ like the flyer and Marina Bay Sands. The night safari showcased the animals in a much more active state then regular zoo visits and the lighting was enough to see most of the exhibits really well. Also have additional benefit of walking through the zoo at night also which was great for the kids with the otters all out and active they loved it!!!
,,Amazing to watch the animals so active,5.0,,Our family of four loved the night safari - the animals were extremely active and the tram makes it feel that you are right in amongst them all. Was an incredible experience and one we will not forget
,,Too busy and didn't manage to do much,2.0,,"So I contemplated booking a visit to the Night Safari online which was a smooth transaction. Not an easy place to get to though but once I got there I stood in line like everyone else for 1.5 hrs to get to the Night safari. This already ate into the time to see anything else. The night safari ride was ok, probably best for the kids and saw possibly 45% of the animals. By the time I got back most if not all shows were booked or not running anymore so I headed back to the bus. Very expensive night that proved not worth it. Very dissapointed. Tickets should be limited as the attraction cannot cope with the volume of tickets sold in its current state."
,,So fun! Recommended,5.0,,So fun! I actually got to ride the troll twice and I saw more animals at the second time. I think the darker the better.
,,To recommend,5.0,,"Me and my son (6 years old) enjoyed it. We recommend to come after 8pm. Many visitors accessing the Night Safari at 7pm, when most of the ZOO visitors finish their tour in ZOO. We came at 8.15pm. We waited ca 5 min for the bus and enjoyed the ca 40 min tour through the Night Safari.

Fire show: nice.
Well organized by the staff, many thx for your assistance!
Food / drinks: food courd available: nice choice!"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,We especially liked the opportunity to go through the zoo by ourselves at the night time. It is just so great to see the animals at the night hours. As for the animals we absolutely loved fruit bats!
,,"Neat Experience, Expensive",4.0,,"The Night Safari is very neat and unique experience that is fun. The car ride is informative and the walks let you see some of the animals up close. It's unfortunate that some of the animals can only be seen on the car ride portion, like the elephants or the rhino. The enclosures that you can walk through are quite fun a unique, like the parma wallaby and the birds/bats enclosures. While I think the Night Safari is a unique place to visit, I do think it's overpriced for what you get. They offer a live show and a lion feeding that I didn't get to see, but I would suggest making it to those as well if you want to feel like you got your money's worth."
,,Better than a zoo,3.0,,"It was better than going to a zoo. The animals are somewhat free ranging, but somehow they are on display as the trams drive by. If you don't mind the Disney -like line ups for the trams and crowds, you will enjoy the experience. As we tend to shy away from the crowds, we preferred using the hiking trails, although you couldn't see everything."
,,Excellent night for me,5.0,,"First I was scary.Because,Tram didn't have window.But it's was very exciting.I have never seen animals from near distance. I want to go one more time."
,,Fun Evening,4.0,,Hi. We did the night safari. The staff were very helpful in resolving a booking error on our part. The small animal display was not great but the tram journey was good and the view of animals so consistent that it did make you wonder if the animals were real - although we did of course know they were!! We finished the evening with a bite to eat in one of the restaurants and it was very good value. Worth the money.
,,Unhappy animals and screaming children.,1.0,,"We did the night safari at about 9pm. The place was packed mainly with very young children screaming and crying, probably as they aren’t used to being up this late. The tour felt very artificial. It was like the universal studios tour, but with the addition of bothering some poor animals. I’ve been to a few zoos, but the animals seemed very unhappy here. Several pacing back and forth looking so agitated as our large bus with blaring commentary drove though. The tickets weren’t cheap and I really wished I’d just sent the money to an actual rescue reserve rather waste time and money on an overcrowded attraction which seems fairly cruel."
,,Such a great experience - exceeded expectations,5.0,,"What a great experience this was - up closer to the animals than I expected to get. Our package included pick up, drop off and a buffet dinner. The dinner was delicious - more than you could eat and delicious. Our tour guide was great, provided all essential information and info you didn't realise you needed. The proximity to the animals surprised me and actually how many are nocturnal was also surprising. They were active and interested by our presence too. The kids and bid kids will love it."
,,Good but many animals were not be seen,4.0,,"The ride in tramp was awesome. Some animals like lions, baison and elephants were clearly visible.
Tiger was amazing
But few animals like leopard, sloth bear, rhino we're not visible in the enclosure
Walk was definitely good to see few of them closely
Animals show was average, not worth waiting so long as they have shows in intervals and not running back to back"
,,My favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,My friend's and I love the vibe of the place..Staff is really nice and queues are well managed. Overall management enhance the Safari experience.. Keep up the good work
,,Loud safari,3.0,,"Food was expensive there although ambience was nice. The night safari itself was too crowded and noisy. The exhibits were crowded, difficult to see the animals. The tourists visiting talked loudly all the way through every exhibit. It was not a pleasant experience."
,,A fresh and exciting new look of the zoo.,5.0,,"The tapir was | | <--- this close to me when I rode the tram. It was lovely to see some of these beautiful creatures at night. It's much more cooling and enjoyable to explore the zoo then, especially with loved ones~"
,,Missing animals,2.0,,"We went on 8.15 PM show on last Sunday where half of the animals were missing from the habitat. Few deers, hyenas, elephant alone was there. Not worth the entrance money paid"
,,Night Safari,2.0,,We had been recommended to do this but we were underwhelmed by this. The trip around the park was short and whilst we saw some animals as it was night there were some you couldn’t see.Not worth the time or money.
,,Night Safari Singapore,4.0,,Did the Night Safari with family. 8 and 10 year old kids in April 2019. Great experience in one of the best Zoo’s in the world. Well priced. Well organized. Don’t be late as very popular.
,,The night safari is a must.,5.0,,"We have been here several times. Day and night. The night safari is the best. You can choose to walk or take the little train. Walking gives you a better feeling of the dark envirement with animals around you, hearing the noises when night animals are fed. But it is a bit scary walking in the poor lighted up areas. But I think it is the best option. Be sure to stand on the cottect line when buying tickets."
,,Slightly old,3.0,,"The trams need a major overhaul, wonder how the animals sleep with so much noise around them. Worth visiting though and don't miss the show."
,,Unforgettable night !!,4.0,,"The first thing that we did was the shuttle i nside the safari which is informative and interesting wherein we can see how the animals live at night. After the tour, luckily we were able to catch the show with the talented zoo keepers and the fantastic animals. The zoo was really clean and well maintained. Recommended for children and family."
,,Disappointed!,1.0,,"There was a lot of hype on this and my son (15 months) loves animals. So as it’s very hot during the day we decided on the night safari. It was a massive waste of time, here’s why:
1. Too dark so you can barely see
2. Loooong queues and staff not helpful with stroller. As a place marketed for kids, this should be a basic
3. I read on here some animals might be fake and I was thinking ppl were crazy to say that. But you know what - I think they are right!!!!!! Especially the lion and hippo ‍♀️
Well that’s $66 NOT well spent"
,,comfy tram views animals,5.0,,"the tram is an easy, comfy and safe option to the walking at night [from 730pm]. close visits to seemingly unfenced lions, wolves, red dogs, hippo, rhino, buffaloes, elephants and more smaller like goats, deer, all alert, active in gloaming; quite unnerving but safe."
,,Cool concept but dubious about authenticity,3.0,,"I visited the Night Safari with my family in December 2018. Whilst it is a very cool concept, we were dubious about the authencity of it. As mentioned by other visitors, some of the animals do not appear to be real. Still, as aforementioned, it was a cool concept especially for the younger children."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I wouldnt bother to write a review but saw all the crazy 1 and 2 star reviews so decided I better add my voice!
It's a night zoo...so the animals are different from a normal zoo (nocturnal animals).
The absolute best part is walking around (tram is nice but too fast and far from the enclosurea). Get there...get on the tram and then spend the rest if the evening on a nice stroll through the zoo.
If you dont like walking, have poor night vision or expect to see all the same animals in a normal daytime focused zoo maybe give this a miss"
,,Enjoyable experience!,4.0,,Enjoyable experience! Will advise you to board the tram ride immediately when you enter Night Safari. Sun hasn't set thus you will be able to see the animals.
,,Over-hyped,2.0,,"It’s supposed to be the worlds first nocturnal wildlife park and one of the most important sightseeing place if you are visiting Singapore. Sadly and very frankly it’s an over-hyped place which the local administration has very cleverly succeeded in putting it on the global map. There is a tram ride which takes you around the park in 35 min. The wildlife enclosures are very poorly lit, you can hardly see the animals. The recorded voice in tram, for example, will tell you about the spotted deer, but what you can see barely is a silhouette of an animal in dark. You can hardly make out whether it is spotted or not. Thereafter, you can walk around the park on foot, that’s going to take another 1 Hr, but that’s equally terrible since you hardly get to see any animals, they are either sleeping in hideouts or barely visible in poor light. The walk path takes you to places where the tram does not go, but it’s of no use either. A total waste of time and a very expensive one too. I was very disappointed, expected it to be much better. Give it a miss and you will be happy. Nicely managed though, people around to guide you everywhere. Do carry an umbrella during the walk. If it rains there is hardly anywhere you can go. Very few rain enclosure options. There is also a show ‘Creatures of the earth’, but if you cannot see it due to some reason, don’t worry, you have not missed anything. This is an open air auditorium. Better to do something else. Lots of eating joints inside. Atleast you will not go hungry, however, very limited vegetarian options."
,,Awesome Night safari,5.0,,"For the Spring break i went to a ZOO called RAINFOREST LUMINA. I thought that it was a dramatic place to visit.
Here are my top 5 reasons/examples about why you should visit RAINFOREST Lumina. Firstly, you can view a lot of astonishing animals that hunt for prey or give birth at night. Additionally, you can also ride a power car that takes you around the Rainforest. since then, the animals are free to walk on the road. Fourthly, there are a lot of yummy restaurants to eat in. Also, there are always shows put on for people to watch. In conclusion, RAINFOREST LUMINA is a tremendous place go for vacation or just for fun. If you haven’t been there yet, then I highly recommend you to go there. RAINFOREST LUMINA is amazing! (and you might even see tons of stars)"
,,The night safari was amazing!,5.0,,"The night safari was fantastic! Loads to see and a great atmosphere being in the zoo at night, totally different from the day visit.

The highlight was by far the bat enclosure and being able to walk through and watch them up close feeding on fruit.

Also, the free tour on the safari bus was well worth doing!

Be prepared to wait in a queue at the start for entry but this is deceiving as the safari itself isn't busy once inside."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,"An attraction that everyone, regardless whether you’re a local or tourist; you need to go at least once.
There’s so much interesting nocturnal animals that you learn about. Start off with an overview of the place on a tram ride and followed by walking trail that will take you round the entire attraction.
Transportation is easy and convenient. Enjoy!"
,,A different zoo experience,5.0,,"We were surprised how much we enjoyed our visit. Having seen some reviews we wondered how many animals we'd actually see and if it was worth the entrance fee but it really was.

We purchased tickets in advance and was able to walk straight in, and there was no queues for the term so got straight on. It was a Monday evening at 8:!5pm.

We saw pretty much all of the animals there. Unfortunately you can't really take photographs as its pretty dark and obviously you can't use flash. But we saw lots.

We also mamboed to get straight into the show with good seats. This was fun and we enjoyed seeing the animals on stage, though also pleased they weren't made to perform silly tricks, etc like some places.

We did do some of the walks but it was very hot and humid, so didn't finish them.

Overall a good night and a very different zoo experience."
,,Night safari,4.0,,A very interesting and enjoyable experience if a little disneyesque. Very well organised and several animals were seen . Not completely comfortable with animals being kept in captivity but I understand the need for breeding programmes to re-wild areas and to further our understanding of wider environmental issues. Easy to get to and many taxis and busses available to get back into the city .
,,Don't see much as its dark and tourists noisy,4.0,,"We decided to do night tour at zoo as we fgured it would be much cooler than walking around zoo during the day.
It was a long wait to get on to a train, and we got stuck with men that were so loud behind us. Nice cool breeze as you are driving along and good commentary. Wish they had told everyone to be quiet throughout so we could see more animals.
There are small lights lighting up areas in each section, but the animals don't always sit in it so photos are difficult.
You can walk around tracks which would be a better way to watch the animals in silence without people talking.
Overall a good way to see the Zoo in cooler conditions.

Good restaurants at the gate of the zoo with yummy quick meals."
,,Really Cool Experience,4.0,,"Friend recommended this so we got tickets through Klook last minute and were very happy we did!

Booked the 815 PM time and got in a fairly long line to ride the Night Safari Trolley. Cool experience on the ride. Seemed a bit unreal that we were this close to these nocturnal animals that didn't seem bothered at all by our presence. Trolley ride lasted about 45 minutes and well worth it.

Spent the rest of our time on foot doing three different walking trails where we were able to see other animals.

Great evening spent there and would highly recommend!"
,,Stuart,5.0,,"We booked the private tour on the Night Safari. It was fantastic. Our guide Fahmi was the best and our children loved it - the highlight was feeding the elephants. Definitely worth the money as you see the animals close up!

Fahmi is the best guide ever!"
,,Avoidable,2.0,,This is one part of Singapore that I did not enjoy.This wasn't a real safari.It was just like us visiting any zoo.The animal show was also very basic.
,,Walk in the cool of the night.,4.0,,Clean as the animals are well active in the night. A long journey by bus nest take a tour bus. Forget about day visit unless the weather is cool. You wouldn't want to sweat under the weather here. If don't mind the heat take public bus to and back to enjoy the ride.
,,Really Good,5.0,,"Could see Lions and many animals enjoying , took trip at 7:15pm. Show was good. All family members impressed by the trip."
,,Amazing time at Night Safari,5.0,,"We got to the zoo earlier, sorted our tickets. Then got some food, there is a great selection around. We did the tram ride it's a great way to go round the safari and see the animals. Of course there may be some animals that aren't always around when you go by. It is definitely a good attraction to see. Night safari is part of the zoo. If you were up to doing a whole day you could do the zoo by day and then night safari. The night safari does a Creatures of the night show. That was very good. Its covered with your ticket. The showing I saw was at 9.30pm. If you're lucky they do ask for volunteers during the show!"
,,Amazing to see animals at night,5.0,,"My Travel agent had arrange a coach pick up to the Night Safari which was great. We has a guide help use and explain things to us. The tram is great and you past so many different animals. I then walked the track around the safari and even saw part of the animal show.
A great site and well worth visiting. I think getting a pick up and drop off from you hotel is the best way of getting there."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Brilliant and worth the time to visit open 7pm to midnight there are also river safari and zoo at the same location
,,Really Nice (Night) safari,5.0,,"Been first time here with family and kids, all are enjoyed. Zoos are well maintained all the animals can seen very nearer via tram service available frequently."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"One of the highlights of our short stay in Singapore, never been to anything like this before so expectations low, got there via MRT + bus (bus ride alone was 40 mins) so arrived around 20:30, a bit concerned we wouldn't get monies worth before having to get last bus/MRT back but the zoo provided a shuttle bus ($6 pp) back to the centre of Singapore dropping off at several key areas including Clarkes Quay so we could relax and enjoy the visit. The place is huge with the usual gift shops and food outlets, fairly quiet when we arrived and no queues for anything - you actually get your entrance ticket at the zoo (across the road from the night safari) cost £55 for 2. A shuttle runs every 10 mins and we didn't have to queue at all. The route takes you past numerous open areas where the animals are relaxing - they are not at all bothered by the tram and we saw lions, elephants, bears, flamingos + many more, some (not dangerous) animals are roaming free so came very close to the tram carriages - it really was a great experience. We stayed for the last animal show - again plenty of empty seats and a very small queue but to be honest it wasn't our thing - prob aimed more at young children. I would deff recommend a visit"
,,"Too crowded, more hype than fun !!!",3.0,,"We had already experienced the Zoo, bird park and Amazon river safari before we came for the Night safari. Our experience was that the place was over crowded, with long queues to get in and than there were lots of tourists all around and the worst part was the mosquitoes biting while watching the shows. The tram ride was decent and it gave us glimpse of some of the rare nocturnal creatures.

We saw the tribal dance performances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. They were quite good. The best one was Creatures of the Night Show where there was a performance presented by the animals in the Night Safari.

There are a few food outlets in the Night Safari like Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant, Casa Italia, Bongo Burgers, etc. One can also dine in the ""Evening in the Wild"" at Night Safari's only Tepee tent. The food was strictly okay, nothing great to write about for the price we paid.

I would say if you are pressed for time, it can be avoided to visit the Night Safari."
,,very interesting ride,5.0,,It's very nice to go around the zoo at night. the trip drives you around diverse animals and its a great experience. To avoid the long queue (more than 30min wainting) you can buy a fast track. But it worth the waiting.
,,Highly Disappointing,2.0,,"Three words to define the experience: Over-hyped, over-priced and mismanaged.
We took the first slot for safari which starts from 7.30 pm, we reached there at 6.30 and stand in queue for 1 hr then the officials asked us to go for a theater play which was an hour long. It was not at all entertaining.
Then we waited in queue to get into the cart for like 2.5 hrs. Finally we got into a cart and safari started.
Poor visibility and very less number of animals to display. They showed buffaloes and deer which are commonly seen on some streets in India :/ .
Total journey was only 35 to 40 mins. We totally wasted our evening and while exiting we couldn't find a cab and had to go by bus.
Very bad experience, we recommend not to go."
,,A different experience,4.0,,"We have seen so many zoos, but seeing the animals at night in their natural habitat was a different story.
It was very crowded .We managed to reach the tram spot and got into it. As it seats 4 in a row, we had a good view as it rolled silently from enclosure to enclosure.
Very interesting to see the animals at night with the help of the concealed lights.
We also saw the Creatures of the night show. It was very educational.
Only problem was the stifling heat and the crowd."
,,My second visit,4.0,,I have been here before a long long time and today I came and everything the same as it was. Nice to be here with your kids.
,,Shell out for the “Safari Adventure Tour”,5.0,,"It was our first visit to the night safari (despite being long time residents of Singapore) and we decided to take up the Safari Adventure Tour. This was well worth the money! The group is kept small, we had a fun, outgoing and knowledgeable staff (Elena) as a guide, a buggy ride, elephant feeding, and reserved seats at the Creatures of the Night show. The nearly three hour tour helped us appreciate the Night Safari far more than we ever could had we done this on our own. We also visited on a Saturday and the Safari Adventure Tour made for a very comfortable visit on what was an extremely popular day for visitors."
,,"Fantastic, don't let the distance deter you.",5.0,,"Previous reviews citing the sheer distance of the Night Safari from town should note that the Mandai area is in part a nature reserve, away from the city's noise pollution, and part of a larger project for conservation separate from the city. If you're looking for the likes of Central Park's zoo, this isn't for you!

We came here during the March school holidays which was a little poorly timed. However, if you arrive early and have a walk before the show, you can still get a lot in and have time to spare for the tram ride and more exploring afterwards. After 9pm, it starts getting quieter as the families with children leave.

It's a dimly lit place as well so just be careful, but I really appreciated this because it created a conducive environment for the animals. The tram ride was very enjoyable as well as it passed through free-range areas for some animals, that are allowed to roam in a spacious area.

We stayed until closing time and loved the experience, especially the reserve's focus on conservation. Our only concern was the leopard's and bear's pacing, which bothered me quite a bit...but all the animals in general looked well-taken care of, happy, and safe."
,,Only one in the world!,5.0,,"We loved it! By try to buy tkts in advance, we got there for the 7:15 entrance and was sold out, got to wait until 8:15, but loved it and enjoyed it very much!"
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"Perhaps the only night safari in the world.So when in Singapore its not to be missed.
Combine it with the animal show and the fire show.Also has nice food and drinks options.They have different time slots.I think the 7.15pm slot is the best and tends to fill up pretty fast."
,,No excitement,2.0,,The night safari was too far away form where we live and it was not interesting at all. The whole experience was nothing much for what for pay for.
,,"Okay, but not worth the hype",3.0,,Difficult to actually see the animals. Photos are near impossible. And ridiculously long lines to wait for the teams. The idea is very cool though!
,,Night safari,5.0,,I enjoyed this trip. Its very popular ao be prepared to get there early and queue. There are fire eater shows to help with waiting. The show was good and informative and the food courts offer a wide variet of foods at reasonable prices. Take water and mosquito repellent.
,,Good ride and not so much to see,3.0,,"This is good way how to finsh zoo day after visiting main zoo and river safari, but not worth to pay extra or visit only alone. This was the most haotic park and least organized - people must wait around one hour before opening and when thay open then they start fire performance which you can not see but must stand ir another queue while they deside to allow people get in arena where some kind of show later is performed (weak). After show you get a ride along park - oportunity to see animals, but if you spent already whole day in zoo then this will not impress. No flash so pictures will not be good as during day."
,,Night dragon awakes,5.0,,No words to explain it... Again must to do while in Singapore.... Dont be scared is the mamtra... Enjoy
,,The Unorthodox Zoo,4.0,,It's far off from city and for a wildlife and safari enthusiast it can be hell of an attraction. The toy train that gave us a ride through the jungle was a good touch. Being there on a rainy night was an add-on to the attraction because it made the wilderness wilder (albeit rains made us miss few of the special shows). In order to be able to watch all the shows you have to invest a lot of time since few of these shows start very late in the night. All in all it was a fresh way to observe the fauna and a wonderful tourist attraction.
,,This part of the Zoo which shows off its animals at night was not one that is nothing with nothing event!,3.0,,Large crowds all shuffling around and queuing to get onto the trams that go round for 45 mins. Animals are obviously fed and therefore have no need to go hunting for food.
,,Crowded but worth it,4.0,,"We arrived for our 8:15booking early ; however there was a massive queue- this moved quickly, then we moved on to the trams and saw so many many creature! It was beautiful . We then went to see the creature of the night show! This is a must watch! The presentation lady was awesome! She engaged and did a perfect job!
Then we walked round on the walking trail and again this was good as you were closer to the animals! We did not eat here as we were told by friends that it wasn’t worth it!
For the animals and the general animals it is s was great!"
,,Well worth doing,5.0,,"Simply for ease we took an organised trip and actually it was worth it. We were collected from outside our hotel and returned to the door step. We chose one that included dinner - which was surprisingly good - a multi ethnic buffet and as much as you could eat. It was all good quality. We simply had to buy the beer to go with it.
Then because we were on an arranged tour we got to jump the queue for the train that takes you around the park. And so you leap on this train/tram and head out on the night safari. There's no guarantee that you will actually see any animals because to all intent and purpose they are wild animals and the humans are the captives - and of course the aim is to see their nocturnal habits. Well we did see a whole range of animals who seemed oblivious to the train in the dark - it was great fun - but my photos were pretty rubbish sadly! At the end of the ride we were free to walk some areas of the park as well, which was excellent. It was a very enjoyable evening and great to be able to step on a coach and the end to take us right back to the hotel. I guess it would be pretty easy to arrange it for yourself and cheaper but we were being lazy and I'm glad we did."
,,The Best Zoo I Have Ever Been To,5.0,,"Entertaining, beautiful and facilities to keep everyone in our group happy. Night Safari a must. Take a drink bottle as you can fill it up as you go around the park. Stay hydrated."
,,"Okay, rather visit the Singapore zoo",4.0,,"Night safari is for people who don't have better things to do at night. While we saw unique animals that were more active at night, but frankly I found the zoo and river safari to be more enjoyable."
,,Interesting but possibly over rated,3.0,,"I was rather disappointed with this visit, given the glossy advertising. The information regarding how the train system worked was not clear until we got there. We ended up doing the walk around the zoo first, but had to get all the way back to the start to get the tram/train, whereas we'd have preferred to have had a rest and been able to get on part way. I was also concerned about the limited space that the animals had - to ensure they would be ""in the spot light"" for tourists."
,,A Bit Disappointing,3.0,,"I preface this by saying I have been to some truly impressive wildlife parks and shows so perhaps I’ve been spoiled. But, my overall impression of the Night Safari is....meh!
The park itself is out of Singapore proper, but a Grabcar was only $18 to get there from downtown and a taxi back was about $25. $48 for park entrance seemed high. The park reminded me a little of a Disney park - very crowded, bad overpriced food and a bit hokey. It just seemed more like an amusement park than a wildlife or nature park. Included with admission was the Creatures of the Night Show. Lame. A good portion of the audience left half way through. I think there were 5 creatures that they managed to stretch out for what seemed like an hour. Simply overplayed, not particularly informative. The “audience interaction” was painful. Also included was a tram ride through the park. Again, my beef is that many of the animals are the same as you would see during the daytime. The problem is that , obviously it is dark, and many were out of site despite the also-painful canned narration that would describe them whether they were there or not. Most of the enclosures were lighted, so if you could see them, it was the same as viewing them in the daytime just a bit harder to make out. They were not active. You can also walk through the park which at least gives you adequate time at each enclosure, but again, nothing I would say that was extraordinary or noteworthy. At least there were not a lot of biting bugs. If you’ve never been to a zoo, or had little experience with nature parks, maybe this would be interesting for you. If you frequent such places, don’t bother adding this to your list."
,,Night safari is a complete waste of time and money,2.0,,"After spending quite a large Grab fare to get there and paying the not small admission fee, we waited in line for approximately 30 minutes before boarding a tram for a 30 minute ride on which we saw maybe 4-5 animals. Then the night show was full so we waited around for another 45 minutes — with nothing to do but shop in the gift shops — for what ended up being a very lame “fire” show. Maybe the venue would be good during the day but don’t waste your time going at night."
,,Night safari great but poorly organised,2.0,,"We bought tickets for night safari for the first slot available (19.15) to ensure we could enjoy the night safari with our 4 year old before bedtime. Arriving at 7PM and long queues a head of us. We decided to watch the night-show first but we were informed 19.15 show was full.... come back for the 20.30 show was the message. We queued up for the tram ride for some 20-30 minutes, got on the ride and enjoyed it very much.
Very much worth the effort and we could even see most of the animals, great experience. What was less great was that when we returned to “station” some 8.10 PM we were told the 20.30 show was already full and we were asked to return 21.30! Really annoying to have ticket for 19.15 and still no guarantee to get into the show. Bad organised and planned by night safari!!!
There are also 5(?) different walks where you can see the animals by foot. This is a well worth to do. We did some of the walks and then we returned home to put our son to bed and therefore we missed the show and I cannot comment what it was about. Night Safari is great but the poorly organised and lack of information of how it works gave a bitter taste to us and our 4 year old.
Hint of advice, try to avoid the weekend as that is even more crowded."
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,"I booked for the night safari online before we went to Singapore and just printed the tickets at home. I was a bit put off by some of the negative reviews but actually it turned out to be a very enjoyable visit.

We travelled to the Night Safari by one of the coaches’ that come to the hotels. Ours was with SAE and it cost us $10 return to be picked up at the hotel around 6pm to get to the Night Safari for about 7pm and we took the last coach back at 11.15pm.

When we got there people were queuing but this is because they were watching the fire show at the entrance and not walking into the zoo. We walked straight in as we picked the furthest lane from the fire show so no queuing for us. We asked the man that checked our ticket for a map as we had decided to walk round first. There were some people queuing for the tram ride as I think coach parties come here and must be pushed for time so they go on the tram first. As we went at 7.15 it was just turning dusk and there were lots of bats flying round and squirrels which can be a bit scary. We did see lots of animals as we walked round. Obviously in a zoo there is no guarantee to see an animal you just have to be in the right spot at the right time. We timed it right to see the leopard and one of the tigers as they appeared just as we walked up to their enclosures. We hardly saw anyone else as we were walking round which was a bit surreal. The walking routes cover some of the same area of as the tram but the tram also has its own section as well.

When we had finished walking round we got the tram which didn’t have any queue at this point and was more than half empty. Your ticket time is for the entrance to the park, not when you have to get a tram. The only animals we didn’t see were the wolves. We saw the hippos as we were walking round but they had gone by the time we went past on the tram. After the tram ride we popped outside to one of the eating places. You can have your hand stamped so you can get back in to the park. We then went back in to watch the last animal show. I enjoyed the show. It was suitable for both kids and adults. We didn’t queue for the show but did have to sit in the side wings rather the centre.

We had wanted to see some flying squirrels in their walkthrough enclosure so walked back to that but didn’t see any, however when we were on the tram I had seen a wild one fly through the air and land on a tree so at least I did get to see one."
,,Animal lovers,4.0,,"I had never been to a night zoo, so this was on my list. Booked tickets online and asked at our hotel and they had a SAEX bus that you could get there and back for $6 a person each way. Bear in mind the traffic at this time of day, this was an easy option. Zoo is lovely, fire show was good, creatures of night show was good too, though some people ruin it by not listening and using flash on their cameras. We were lucky as it wasn't crowded and we didnt have to queue for anything. Tram ride was nice and again ruined by idiots who don't listen and used flash and talked so loud you couldn't hear the commentary - got told to shut up! Was great to see animals up close and walk on trails and have bat fly over your head - creepy but fun. Well looked after place would definitely go again."
,,Bit disappointed,3.0,,"We were so looking forward to the safari having had great feedback from friends who had done it. Unfortunately we left a little disappointed. We had taken time to have camera set up to take photos (without flash) but tram moved far too quickly to capture a lot of the animals...we also had no help when tram ride finished to guide us to the walking areas on the site..instead we were just left at food court area and exit.
Day trip to the zoo would have been better ...."
,,Enjoyable Evening,4.0,,Evening we visited was very busy with a number of large tour bus groups pays to get there early.Enjoyed the tour around the zoo.Ee took the train / bus from Singapore CBD took about 1 hour 20 minutes cost approx S$6 per person return
,,Boring and over hyped.,1.0,,The rats were the most interesting animals we saw. The show at the start was aimed at small children and too Disney-like.
,,"OK, but maybe overrated",3.0,,The night safari tram does take you past a number of habitats but the animals for several are not where they can be seen and others may be difficult to see well in the low light. Not sure this is worth the cost and trip from the central city.
,,Wonderful Night Safari,5.0,,"This was my first ever night safari. It is a must watch for kids. We took the Night safari in the Tram with English announcements. The 45 min trip was very memorable, we could see many animals in the night and kids enjoyed the most."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Unfortunately arrived late as we travelled by MRT and didn't realise how far out of the city the zoo was. The staff were very helpful and put us on the next tram. The animals were all out, we saw Lions, Tigers, Deer and sun bears. We didn't have time to explore any of the walks but did have time to see the Creatures of the Night Show. The show was ok but if you are short of time we would recommend missing that and walk around the zoo"
,,Don’t miss the shuttle bus!,4.0,,"The night safari was an enjoyable experience but you should make sure you get there early. The park opens at 7pm and we made the mistake of booking a ticket for 9:15pm thinking that we were getting on a special tram ride at that time. NO... it is actually just your admission time to the park. You still need to line up for the tram ride. Line up to see the special informative animal shows they put on and walk around the park yourself. As there are exhibits that you won’t be able to see from the tram.
Lots of animals to see and most of them you’ll probably see on your own rather than from the tram. The show was good as they brought out some animals that you wouldn’t usually get to see on your own.
Lots of eating venues and shops there too which we didn’t know about.

We travelled to the night safari via a $1 Mandai Khatib shuttle bus from Khatib MRT station. It was very convenient except for the fact that it stops running at around 10:45pm yet the night safari park is open until 12 midnight. We made the mistake of waiting at the wrong bus stop and missed this bus. The next alternative transport from the park to the city is via a $6 shuttle running until around 11:30pm. These were unfortunately sold out so our only other option was to hire a taxi. This only cost $25 which wasn’t too bad."
,,Entertainment,3.0,,"Kind of boring compared to day tour in zoo. Cant really see much in the night. Therefore, not worth the money."
,,great time,5.0,,Loved all the animals we saw it was amazing how close we were to all of them! The tiger was my favorite :)
,,Well Worth a Visit,4.0,,"My wife and I went to night safari at Singapore Zoo 14th March 2019. There is a little pre-show which takes 15 minutes and this was very enjoyable. We then boarded the tram for the actual night safari which was informative and enjoyable. Lovely atmosphere in the food and shop area after, where we enjoyed a fire show with dancers. We combined this with an earlier river safari and this is a good combination. Recommend."
,,"Not very many animals visible when we went at 10:30, the ride was very bumpy and fast.",3.0,,"Not as spectacular as I've heard. The ride was fast and bumpy. Seemed like the driver just wanted to finish the trip fast. There were very few animals visible, and most of the ones that were visible were different species of deer."
,,Waste of time and expensive,1.0,,"As a Singaporean I heard so much about the night safari and so I thought I would pay a visit. Bought ticket online and was asked what time is my visit and I choose 7.15pm. Enter the night safari there was a long queue for the tram ride we waited almost 30 minutes before getting into the tram ride. To be honest we cannot see much animals along the route but we thought we can just go and see more by foot. The tram ride took about 30 minutes and we were back around 8.15pm and found out there was an animal show at 9pm but we need to start queuing at 8.30pm. Why do we need to keep wasting time queuing when in the first place we have a timing for our ticket? And we thought we could just go to the trail by foot to see more animals. It took us about an hour to complete the trail and I must say it is a complete waste of time and we found most animal enclosure are empty or poorly lit, there was basically nothing for us to see except that there are many deer type animals and some cat family animals. In the end we missed the 9pm show and was told there is a 10.15pm show but it might already be full because there was some prebooking done. I was puzzled and asked why are there pre booking and in the first place I was told to queue half an hour before the show and the staff told me it was a tourist group. This is a very bad experience and a waste of money. Avoid it at all cost"
,,night safari,2.0,,"I didn't see much of the animals described by the ""voice guide"". Little bit dissapointed. Will not visit again."
,,train commentary too lood and too much,3.0,,expected more - did not know before that there are two parks - one for the night safari is different...
,,A bit different!,5.0,,The night safari had been recommended to us and we were not disappointed. It was an excellent evening and seeing animals in a totally different environment was magical.
,,It's a bit of a gimmick and you cannot see much anyway,3.0,,"I can appreciate that some animals are more active at night and would thus be better observed at night, but the problems are 1) A human cannot see that well at night and coupled with the zoo's (correct) use of less intense lights, even less is visible; 2) Photos don't turn out that well; 3) There are more mosquitoes than during the day; 4) It is more humid at night(?); 5) It is relatively more inconvenient to get there in the evenings; and 6) You can fall asleep due to the lateness of the activity. I would advise visitors to just go to the Singapore Zoo and skip the Night Safari, or skip all of those shows and secure the earliest trams to be able to see the animals before it is truly dark. I would advise the zoo to concentrate on animals that are only active at night (hence, not elephants), including marine life, thus making this zoo truly unique and worthwhile for visitors. I'm not sure if that would be financially successful though!"
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,Growing up in South Africa I have experienced many night drives in the games parks. I was a bit hesitant to do the Night Safari because I thought it might be a disappointment. I can report back that it was highly entertaining and worth every cent. A must-do if you visit Singapore.
,,"Fun evening out, but let me preface this by saying I am from East Africa where the real Safaris are...",4.0,,"So read a lot of reviews about this and seemed like a fun thing to do. We were excited and went. Now note that we were born in East Africa, where the Serengeti and the Masai Mara are at our doorstep, so our rating is a little bit unfair considering. Although with that in mind we were open minded when going. The whole setup/organization/service, etc was amazing. But that was also a bit of the downside in itself. Felt too perfect and choreographed. Nothing Wild about it, all in Captivity. It was as if the animals were stuffed and moving from far with motors or at minimum, sedated. How does a female Lion not eat the other animals less than 50 metres away from it? That's not nature! Let's be honest. Unless there are invisible electric fences around, some of it all didn't make sense. But nevertheless a good outing and especially fun for the unsuspecting kids who won't tie logic to the goings on of this ride...otherwise be ready to answer some hard questions!! :)"
,,TERRIBLE,1.0,,"It was highly under our expectations. Very boring ! Hinnestly, it's a real waste of time and money !"
,,More flexibility,3.0,,"We found that there could have been more flexibility of the safari entrance. There is a counter set up near the entrance, however we can’t buy our tickets there. We were told that we need to walk all the way back to the zoo entrance to collect our online booking tickets from a foreign website. I hope more flexibility could be given so that we will not waste time"
,,Night safari walk,5.0,,"great place , animals are closer to view ,it'll be much much better if able to have a session where u can touch the animals n be more educated abt them."
,,Highly recommend.,5.0,,The highlight of our visit to Singapore. Well organised with excellent staff. Very informative tour.
,,A beautiful zoo and an amazing night safari...,5.0,,"I am sure everyone as a kid ( at least me for sure) always wondered how a zoo looked at night.... The answer to it is Singapore zoo and it's amazing night safari.
The zoo houses a variety of animals and beautifully maintained...
The boat ride is beautiful..

And the Amazon rain forest section is an unique experience... Must see...
The best part is the night safari... Starting after dark, tourists are taken in a tram all around the zoo with a commentary going on... One can get to see all the animals in the night time...

One can even take a walking trail in the zoo and get up close to the animal enclosures- bats, leopards etc... You can even see them being fed...

A must visit at Singapore"
,,Skip the queues - take the private tour,5.0,,"We booked the private night safari prior to visiting the zoo and we were really happy that we had. To book I emailed the zoo months in advance of our trip and they were quick with their responses. I paid in advance, we opted not to include dinner but you do have to purchase an entry ticket as well. On arrival the lady on the customer service desk knew it was us before even saying. I thought this odd but it turned out that there were only 4 people on the tour that night. The tour can accommodate a maximum of seven people, we were all adults which was good. We were met by Nua our superb and knowledgeable guide. We were escorted to the show for the first one of the night and seated in reserved seating area with a super view. Afterwards we were taken to a golf buggy and away we went. The advantage of this option is that you can ‘loiter’ round the enclosures and get a good view of the animals whilst listening to really informative details about the animals, the zoo etc. Joining the throngs on the tram does not allow this and they pass the private tour regularly. It included a walk in the leopard area, this was the only animal we didn’t manage to see! We were treated to seeing some of the smaller cats being fed. The tour included feeding the elephants and this in itself was fantastic. I felt very privileged to do so and meet these creatures. You were able to touch one of them the others were just over the fence. Our tour started about 7pm and we left at 11pm so it was well worth it. This is not a place to take photos because you can’t use a flash but actually you can enjoy the animals without the pressure to photograph them. The zoo is about an hour from the centre, we took a taxi each way at reasonable cost for the duration at about $30spd from garden Bay Area. Buses do run to the zoo but take in excess of an hour. There are plenty of taxis for the return.
All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our evening."
,,"Sorry, Not Up to its Hype. Not Recommended",2.0,,"Boy, I had really high hopes when we came to the Singapore Night Safari. It looks cool and I liked the idea but the reality that many of the animals do not co-operate and come out at night to be seen or seen easily. Those that do seem to be on the other side of the tram. The lighting is poor and it is difficult to see at times. I love to take photos wherever I travel but this venue was a bust for photo taking. Between the low night lighting and the constant moving of the tram it is nearly impossible to get any clear photos.

BOTTOM LINE: So disappointed in this excursion. With 4 people on a seat bench on the tram, it is hard to see both sides. The night show is ok. Overall I did not think it was worth the time and money to see this hyped up ""night safari"". I was bored. Save your money and pass! MY RATING: 4/10."
,,Wow wow wow - loved it,5.0,,"As mentioned we had combined tickets for all four parks - the zoo, the bird park, the river safari and the night safari.

We booked our tickets for the night safari for 7.15 as they opened - due to traffic queues we arrived at 7.45. The queues for the tram ride were massive, so we set off walking around the rest of the zoo. It was dusk but amazing. The lighting is very cleverly done and we saw animals that are nocturnal and that we have never seen out before in other zoos. It was simply amazing and as most people were queuing for the tram ride we had front row views of all of the animals.

We did then go on the tram - it goes through areas of the zoo that you cannot walk around so you see other animals.

SO SO worth it and thoroughly enjoyed by both of us. We sprayed ourselves with insect repellent and survived our nearly four hour visit with no bites!"
,,One of a king tour,5.0,,"The Night Safari is an open-air zoo and is opened in May 1994 and is set in a rainforest environment on 35-hectare of land.
The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo. There are different exhibits, shows and zones. At the Night Safari you can find more than 130 species of animals and some of the animals are on the Endangered List. Some of the animals you can see in the Night Safari include Oryx, Flamingo, Asian lions, White African lion, Spotted hyena, Sloth bear, Nile Hippo, Malayan tiger, Clouded leopards, Hog, Barking deer, red deer, Asian elephants and American bison. The animals are visible by using a light that resembles moonlight which doesn’t disturb the animals.
The tour is operated on a guided tram with audio commentary in English. The tram tour lasts about 20 min. Don’t miss out Creatures of the Night show which is about half an hour long. It occurs at the Amphitheatre at 7:15pm, 8:30pm, 9:30pm and 10:30pm. You see otters that do recycling and so many other animals showing their learned or natural talent.
Night Safari is opened 7:15pm - 12am (Last entry at 11:15pm). Entry fee for adult is S$47 and Child $31 and there are many discounts available like buying tickets online and buying multi-park ticket (for Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari, Singapore Zoo). Try to arrive early or buy your entry ticket early, the 7:15pm entry will be sold out. There are several dining options: Ulu Ulu Asian Buffet, Ulu Ulu Indian Buffet/ Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant, Ben & Jerry's, Safari Sizzles and Jungle Rotisserie."
,,"Big queues, do Tram ride first.",4.0,,"Overall it was a good experience. We had tickets for the 7.15 show and they encourage you to see the show before the tram ride which we did. But I wish we had done the tram first and then the show. If you do the tram first, their is still some light - so you can see some of the animals better, plus if you want to take pictures you will get better shots as their is limited light and flashes are not allowed."
,,Up close and person with the animals (fed bats from hand!),5.0,,"Amazing experience -
The night safari brings you close to the animals, with the minimum required barriers. The fact that it's dark brings a whole new mood to the zoo. If you need photos of zoo animals, they're not going to turn out well. Better to search online.
1. I happened to enter the bat area while a scientist was feeding the bats bananas from her hands, and she let me feed them too. Amazing experience. Made me feel more comfortable with bats. Glad it helps habituate bats to humans, so the workers can better monitor them.

2. The tram was nice. It's around a half hour - 45 mins, and it goes around part of the park. It's a nice intro, but walking the park is better.

3. The night show was fun. If you take kids here, you _need_ to bring them to the night show."
,,Brilliant,4.0,,"What a fantastic way to see animals that are in captivity, but not in a cage...went via a guided tour, which was OK, but with traffic issues left us with less time at the Safari than we’d hoped. Saw elephants, lions, tigers, bears, various deers and a leopard to name a few. Great for all ages and any animal lovers."
,,Disappointing tourist trap,2.0,,"Although my wife enjoyed the experience I thought it was deeply disappointing. One saw very few animals and instead there were long queues. We got there quite late, so avoided most of the crowds. We went to the creatures of the night show which was quite entertaining and then the tram trip (with deeply annoying Hollywood style narration). Because of the time we missed the walks which might have been more interesting.
It is also a long way out of the centre - allow an hour if you are going by public transport from the CBD.
At the end of the day it is a victim of its own success. The vast numbers of visitors means that it can't really deliver. And I suppose we all expect to see nature as seen on TV, but of course the reality is very different."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"If you’re visiting Singapore, you shouldn’t miss the Night Safari.

You would be advised to follow certain rules. Kindly ensure you follow it.

This includes being silent as the noise would disturb the animals. It would be a thrill ride but a safe one. I’m sure you would enjoy it as they are the pioneer in the world to have introduced such an experience"
,,Overrated ...,3.0,,"Took the boys who were really looking forward to it. We started with the live show, which was poor in my mind and the boys. Most seats had restricted vision and it was just not good.
We then went on to the train ride, which was the best bit. It lasted around 40min (so did the queue for it, however it did move very quickly, they are soooo efficient!) we then embarked on the walk...which was OK but the boys wanted to see the lion fern and tiger feed and we really struggled to follow the signs as they weren’t very well sign posted and not many rangers on site to ask for directions :( so we ended up missing both so boys were disappointed.
We didn’t try the food there because we were rushing to get to the transport back to city as it is about an hour away.
Final note? We enjoyed it but will not repeat a visit.
Sorry - no pictures"
,,Average visit to Night Safari,3.0,,"I visited the Night Safari in January 2019 after it was recommended to me. While it was a good visit, I found for the price paid it was slightly lacking and rushed in the time available between my Safari booking and when the last bus left to connect with the SMRT to the city, more frequent shuttles would be welcomed."
,,Very unique but over crowded,4.0,,We enjoyed the park. It is a unique opportunity to see nocturnal animals that you won’t see elsewhere. Drawback is it can be very crowded. We went on a Saturday night so I suggest going on a weekday.
,,Best Experience,5.0,,"Go out for the night safari here is a must, we spend couple hours here and saw a lot of animals stayed very closed to us. These animals well trained. Super fantastic."
,,Great night out,5.0,,"Had a fantastic night here, a great tip was to book a later time as it gets very crowded. We booked a 8.15pm entry, we got through gates at 8 and walked straight to the night show that was ready for 8.30, it was already crowded but we got space up the back and enjoyed the show. The lines for the trams were huge so we did all the walking trails first. The trails were great and it was fun seeing a lot of the animals. We headed back to the tram station for 10pm the lines were nothing and we had a relaxing informative trip around the safari. All the small kids had gone by then, so a good tip wait until later to do tram as it was chaotic earlier with young families. We enjoyed the tram and went on the final trip of the evening finishing up at 11.30pm ready to head out the gates straight into a taxi home. Fantastic evening out for young and old. Be prepared for the crowds."
,,"Don't pay for the tour, just go to the Night Safari",1.0,,"We thought it would be good to avoid lines for the tram everyone talked about, and get a meal with the package deal. The former reviewers who stated that it is a cumbersome process to get picked up at a variety of hotels and dropped off after were spot on. Don't do it unless you have a lot of patience. Taxi is best, you can go get a variety of food that you choose there, and wait a bit for the tram lines to dissipate. The best part, anyway, is walking around the entire park to see the animals without the tram noises. We ended up walking at about 9:15PM, lions were being fed, we got a ton of great pics we couldn't snap on the tram (it doesn't stop most of the time in front of animals or close enough for pics). Had to be back at the bus by 10:05, so it was also rushed. Waited so long for the bus connection back to hotel, left and got a taxi anyway. ""Tour guide"" never even introduced himself and did a minimal job showing us around before letting us go on our own.
Do it on your own, just make a plan!"
,,Night safari,1.0,,"This was the biggest rip off in our whole month in SE Asia!! There were barely any animals to see, it’s too far out of town, poorly managed! Basically it’s a minimalist zoo. If anyone saw it in the daytime, they would be out of business."
,,Must visit in singapre,5.0,,Really great place to be at night.Saw most of animal right beside main road.Animals are so we’ll trained.they just move around road and you pass through.best experience
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Done the night tsafari which was ok, didn't get to see all the animals though as some were out of site. They had a limited time for the lumina forest walk which was really good and I really enjoyed it.As we went late didn't get a chance to do other things there, maybe next time i go."
,,Want to go again!,5.0,,"My only regret was that I ran short of time! There was so much to take in.

There is a narrated boat ride, during which we were able to see most of the animals mentioned. Visitors are welcone to take the boat ride a second time. Next time I will!

There are some great live exhibits and so much interesting information posted along the hallways leading to and from the boat ride, including various kinds of fish and large water animals.

Allow a full day if you want to see this and the zoo right next door. I strongly recommend purchasing the ParkHopper Plus pass if you want to this and the zoo plus the beautiful Jurong Bird Park."
,,Not worth the time or money,1.0,,"I really expected a lot more from this attraction- it had good ratings. But it was pricey, and expensive to get to by taxi. The lines to get on the tram were extremely long- just when you think you have reached the front, there is another roped off area with another line to wait in. We were in line longer than the tram ride took. Save your money and time and do something else in Singapore"
,,"Very interesting, but some tourists.....",4.0,,"Some interesting animals we saw during the night safari, not every habitat was ‘active’. Reasonably priced evening for the duration. The Asian tiger was really cool, so were the rhinos. The lineup to get on the train was efficient. We brought our tickets online instead of at the zoo, very easy to do as well.

Just watch out for obnoxious tourists that won’t turn off their flashes for pictures.

We liked it. A good night out!"
,,Great nighttime activity,4.0,,Loved this place and great opportunity to see animals active in a zoo setting. If you are making your own way via public transport go for earlier ticket as last shuttle back to MRT station is 10.40.
,,"LOVE THE NIGHT TIME, EVEN BETTER IF THERE WERE ANIMALS TO SEE!",3.0,,"The Night Safari tour overall was a bit of a bust for me. With all the hyped about this being one of the top zoos in the world I was set for a world class experience. The concept is brilliant, the atmosphere at night is amazing but getting to see the animals,, i.e. the reason one goes to a zoo, was pretty weak.
The tram ride was horrible. You get schooled over and over about the importance of not using flash photography, both for the animals and fellow visitors’ experience, and to not make any noises that might startle the animals. We get on the tram and get blinded right away as the staff are going around taking flash photos of you sitting there so they can get more money out of your pocket. Then the tram we were on squealed like a banshee every time our non-attentive driver hit the brakes. You could not hear yourself think as the noise of the brakes was so loud. Additionally, if our driver had of spent 25% as much time focusing on his job of driving instead of flirting with the female staff member he would have been more effective at slowing down so we could actually see a few of the animals that were out. Glad I did it but v pressed to say I would go again, this coming from a true zoo aficionado."
,,Slightly disappointed,2.0,,Had been advised that the Night Safari was a Must Do..... liked the concept and in parts the trip was quite good but overall wouldn’t rush back
,,so crowded,4.0,,"i really enjoyed it but it was so crowded. You'll be waiting in lines no matter what. You can purchase a priority ticket but I couldn't justify the extra cost so went with the crowd.
The animal might show was cancelled due to rain and it was only light.
The safari tour is really great but the trolley doesn't slow down so its hard to get your pictires and have time to take it in. zbut you can walk around after to certain areas.
Head for the bus terminal afterwards and you can get back to the city for $ 6 per person near your hotel"
,,don;t go too late,3.0,,"It was an OK experience but expensive for what it was. The cost of tours run out of the city centre were very high so we took a cab and arrived at about 20.45 with a $30 cab ride. There was poor sinage for tickets and we were directed back and forth for 30 minutes until we found somewhere to buy tickets..

We were told to run as the last ""show"" was 21.30. If you don't like seeing animals perform for human pleasure then don't go to this.

We didn't have to queue for the tram and saw quite a few animals that were clearly very tame and not phased by us going very close
We decided to get a drink before getting a bus back but by 23.15 everything was shut (the attraction is advertised as begin open to midnight) A bit disappointed we went to get a bus only to be told last transport expect taxis leave around 23.00. So a pricey cab home.

The other issue was that when buying our entry tickets we were asked if we had flown with Singapore Airlines. When i said yes I was asked for our boarding cards. I explained that I tend to chick these away and not just keep them in my pockets. R+That error cost me $20 and it would have been nice to know in advance"
,,Singapore Night Safari,5.0,,"On our recent trip to Singapore, we spent a full day visiting the Singapore Zoo and River Safari during the daytime and did the Night Safari at night! Highly recommend all 3! We booked the 7:15 p.m. night safari tour (book ahead as it does sell out) and it was about 45minutes! This time is good as it's dusk in the beginning and fully dark by the end. Ride was very cool, going through and seeing nocturnal animals in their natural habitat, many of them free range just like if you were on a real safari! Only thing I would have done differently is bring by digital camera for pictures---my iPhone didn't do much with either pictures or video at night. And they don't allow any flash photography on the Night Safari so you have to have a nighttime photo capability on a digital camera if you want to capture it. It just doesn't get any better than seeing Asiatic lions, elephants, rhinos and many others in action at night!"
,,We were expecting more...,3.0,,"Being rated as a must-see attraction in Singapore, we were looking forward to a great venue. Probably our expectations were too high, particularly fueled by the price. At the end we had some fun, but it wasn't great.
On the day we visited, there were definitely too many people (entry at 8:15 pm). After the long queue the show was hard to follow from a corner seat. Once in the main attraction, the safari train, the visibility of the animals was limited. Later we were tired, and it was time to return to the city."
,,Night Safari at Singapore,2.0,,Not worth to go. Almost alll animals are hiding. Long line up for tram. Hard to see anything in a dark. I wouldn't recommend.
,,Good one off experience,3.0,,"If you have not been to Night Safari, it is good to experience it. But I personally would not go there for second times. I went there with my parents and my two kids, 4 and 8 years. The queue was super long. We booked the ticket online. We have to queue for around an hour. The safari itself was less than an hour. There are no food vendor in the queue, only drinks. Our kids were hungry. They were excited when they can see the animals. But they felt that it was too short. They preferred to go to the zoo in the day time so that they can see the animals longer. We had a dinner afterward. As usual, it is overpriced."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We enjoyed visiting the zoo at night to see what the nocturnal animals were up to. The tiger is frightening and the otters are a hoot! Loved the natural enclosures.
,,Bad choice,1.0,,"Bad organisation, bad sign, bad communication, worst zoo in my whole life... I’m sorry to say that, I don’t like this Way, but we waste one night for nothing."
,,No worth it,2.0,,"After a long line, the safary experience is too short. It was hard to see animals. Just a waste of money"
,,Great place to take friends,5.0,,I had a friend who was in Singapore recently and we went to the Night Safari. He really enjoyed himself as there was nothing like this back in Sydney. The park staff were very friendly and helpful when we got lost and even recommended sights to see.
,,Lots of walking,3.0,,"Overall we enjoyed it, 3 adults, 6&3 yr olds. The tram is a must ,takes about 40 minutes and you go all over the zoo. There are lots of animals you don't get to see but that's the nature of zoos."
,,Very crowded,1.0,,"I understand that day was Saturday.
But even though I took so long quote for tram about 40mins,but almost all animals were sleeping.
We couldn’t see show cause taking time for long quote.
We can’t understand by map which routes is better for looking around the Safari.
Very much disappointed:("
,,Not a fan anymore,3.0,,"I did the night safari a few years back and hence went for it with my visitors but it was by far not as nice as in the past. I it felt very mechanical, and brief and less heart."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,We didn’t see a lot of animals because they’re were hidden... The price is too high compare to the zoo.
,,Disappointing,1.0,,Way too crowded and the people on the team were extremely loud even after being told to keep quiet. Hardly saw any animals
,,Always love the Night Zoo!,5.0,,We love going to the night zoo....the animals are always so active at night. If you time it right you can almost wander around by yourself!
,,Too crowded,2.0,,"We brought along my 70 year old parents as they have not been to the Night Safari for over 20 years now. It was a terrible experience for them. Though they were seated elsewhere while we stood in line, the queue was just too long - it was about an hour before we boarded the tram. And the staff was not helpful either. Not friendly. I would not recommend this as a family outing. It was a waste of $40!"
,,Well maintained park,5.0,,Must say this a unique experience. I suggest people to choose a working to so that the crowds are low and you get to experience a spooky walk in the wild.
,,Such a beautiful Tiger,5.0,,"Overall has been a relaxing and beautiful experience. It’s the first safari in my life where you can understand the animals are treated very well. Safe, clean, impressive."
,,Good but the flow of the crowd not smooth,3.0,,"Animation while waiting to enter could be available during the entire waiting time and not hide from trees.
Split queue of people who wants to take train vs people who wants to walk first.
Make pavement more reflective to light to ensure where we put our steps at all time to avood injuries. Put light at the pavement height instead of street type of lighting which create a lighting pollution and reduce night type of night safari experience.
Hand out brochures or inform people to keep their voice down and avoid shouting while visiting. Also explain to them in Singapore we walk on the left side instead of the right side.
Add signs like coloured lines of the section on the pavement to indicate direction and next station to visit. May be developed an Apps/QR code where people people can get and read information about animal ststion or zoo history and add/share pictures to it to zoo websites, social media.
Display QR codes related to each animal station in the train and encourage to use headphones to reduce noise pollution and handle devices to listen which let people to decide if they want to listen or enjoy quiet visit.
Replace your petrol/diesel train with electrical or hydrogen one to reduce air+noise pollution."
,,Lovely after 9pm,4.0,,"We booked online for the 7.15 entry. It was mayhem when we arrived at 7.30pm. What seemed like thousands of noisy visitors with queue snaking everywhere. We queued for the 7.15 entry only to find that the queue had gone in and the queue was for 8.15 entry but the 7.15 sign was still being used. There were ushers shouting here and there to herd visitors into queues. We weren’t given any programme or guide and was somehow led to an animal show. We queued and waited from 7.45 till 8.30 for the show to start. It was a 30 min show, interesting enough with various animals appearing briefly to do its stint. After the show, there was another queue for the tram to get around the park. When the tram ride ended, the park seemed to have emptied itself and we had a wonderful time wandering around on foot. My advice would be to show up after 9pm for a lovey time at a wonderful zoo which probably could not cope well with the deluge at 7.15pm."
,,Night Safari is an over-hyped recommendation,1.0,,"We went to the Night Safari based on reviews and recommendations from various web sites and travel videos. After our visit, we decided that Night Safari is an over-hyped recommendation. We visited on a Saturday night and there was a large crowd during the early evening. The Creatures of the Night show was mediocre because it was cheesy and not very informative. In the Creatures of the Night Show theater, need to sit close to the middle as possible to be able to get a good view of the animals. For the tram ride through the zoo, the waiting time in line was longer than the actual ride through the zoo. The beginning of the tram boarding line is not clearly marked and was changing while we watched in line. We observed that the boarding process could also be more efficient. The tram moves relatively quickly through the zoo which made the sighting animals hard. Suggest walking through the zoo instead of the tram to allow better viewing of the animals. There is an Express Tram option (added cost) that offers guides alternative languages to English but it looked like all the trams moved relatively quickly through the zoo. We would not recommend this attraction to family and friends."
,,Brilliant activity in singapore,4.0,,"Myself and my husband visited the night safari on our last evening in Singapore following a couple of recommendations.
The park and experience were both fab and we had so much fun!

A few things to note; we would suggest eating before you travel over to the park, the food on offer is (as expected) theme park food.
The park can get quite busy so be prepared for lots of excited adults dragging their children around
Public transport is not as easy as you would hope - download the Grab taxi app and get a private car, it's cost and time efficient.

Lots of fun and definitely a recommended activity in Singapore!"
,,Must do,5.0,,A must do when in Singapore. Did the walking trails first then the tram ride and then watched the show. Loved the whole experience. You feel as if you are visiting a jungle at night. Forget the cameras as light is not good enough for taking pictures. Enjoy the experience.
,,"Unique Attraction, Long Ques And Stupid tourists but worth it.",4.0,,"Such a great and unique spin on going
to the zoo. You get a choice of time slot, but you end up to queuing for almost an hour to get onboard the tram safari ride. The ride last for around 30 mins with animal facts given from a prerecorded track, seen alot of animals. Once finished you can take a walk around the park on different walking trails which get you real upclose with the animals, you just have to be patient and let your eyes adjust to the dark. All animals seemed more active and awake under the moonlight! There are some shows, a fire dance that I missed because of queuing and trying to shove everything into the small window, as I managed to rush and get to the animal show, which was well presented and is great for the little ones, maybe a tad short and it did seemed very unorganised when trying to find a seat amongst the crowds of people, it was literally just horde and hope for the best. Unfortunately many people would push and shove, and on the tram ride and whilst in the show, were shining torches, and using flash photography and standing up and ruining the experience for others, staff need to intervene and make them stop, staff did not seem bothered. Great experience, get there early and you will have a good time, just prepare for crowds of people! Just idiotic guests that ruin in."
,,"Purchasing tickets in advance doesn't seem possible, so waiting in a long queue to get one is the only advisable option.",4.0,,"We did the River Safari during the day and wanted to the do the night safari in the evening. We were told that we could not purchase Night Safari tickets in advance, but would have to join a queue that would open at 5.30pm for that evening's ticket sales even though the earliest show started on that day at 8.15pm.

This may present a problem if you have a young family since you will have to occupy them between queuing and purchasing your tickets and then starting your safari. Note that early shows tend to sell out fast, so if the queue is long when you join it, don't expect there to be any spaces on the earlier shows."
,,Where is the giraffe,2.0,,I can't see any giraffe and zebra as what I saw in 2014...and feel that the ride is a bit shorter now.. I guess maybe it is due to the CNY? Very disappointed. I have been longed for visiting these animals again for several years already.....and my family also feels that there were only very few species of animals they can see after waiting for the ride for 20-30 mins
,,Great outdoor in the night,5.0,,My teen nephews and I decided to visit the night safari for a different activity to do in the evenings. Pleasantly surprised with the whole thing from the train ride to the show. Great evening and we were very impressed with the whole thing. Night safari gave us that experience of being in the wilderness at night. Good one Night Safari ! Well done and kudos
,,Night Time Fun,4.0,,"Fun time and affordable! The complimentary tram was a pleasant way to see the animals NOT in cages. After the tram ride, I was able to walk a variety of well marked trails to get a better look at the animals. I was disappoint not to see the shows, so I will have to return."
,,great experience,5.0,,the safari is good. very interesting for the kids or even the adults. very far from the city. worth the visit
,,Busy,4.0,,"Worth a visit if only for the fact you're helping conservation. But it's a busy place. The queue was so long, waited in line for about 40 mins to board the Safari tram. Saw a lot of the animals, some no shows but only to be expected. Saw the lions and the elephants so made my night! The creatures of the night show was well hosted, but I thought a little short. All in all give it a go, but be prepared to queue."
,,Wonderful night with animals......,5.0,,It was a ride with full of excitement.... Enjoyed a lot in the natural like environment in dark night..
,,Great animal experience,5.0,,"AS we arrived, it had just rained heavily, but fortunately it stopped as I would not want to have done this in the rain. Getting in was somewhat chaotic and the place was very busy as it was Chinese New Year, but the tram ride was an efficient way of seeing plenty of the animals efficiently. After that we walked around the trails for more leisurely viewing and were rewarded with some excellent sightings. Away from the start, the trails weren't crowded so getting around was easy. The animals were also fairly active, in contrast to the day time when most of them are sleeping or avoiding the sun."
,,Okay,3.0,,Was quite expensive getting here in a taxi. Public transport cheaper but was 2 trains and a bus probably best to book tickets with a transfer. We took the tram ride it was over quite quickly and as busy the creatures of the night show was full
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,We visited in November and it wasn't as busy as we expected. We had booked our tickets online but there didn't seem to be long queues at the entrance and we managed to get on the first tram that we saw. We enjoyed the tram ride and managed to see most of the animals on show. The walking trails were very good too although it was very humid that night. You have to have a little patience as the animals are not always easy to find. Only complaint was that the taxi fare from the zoo was fixed and it was so much more than the fare from our hotel on the way in.
,,Fun and,3.0,,We went for the night safari. Overall a good experience but had a very long wait time at the tram. They asked us to cross the road and they let about 4 batches of people go ahead of us. We wasted so much time until we got mad and remembered we should have gone ahead.
,,Exciting,5.0,,"We have visited quite a few zoo till date. This one was one of its kind. We had a sumptuous dinner to start with... I loved the variety of sushi served. There are two options... either you cover the zoo on foot or take the train... The ride , I found quite beneficial as we had a lot of area to go around. The train moves slowly allowing you to enjoy the surroundings and watch the animals as well. There is a part you get to cover on foot. We had goosebumps going around in the dark looking at the nocturnal creatures. Quite an exciting trip overall."
,,Total waste of time (5 hours for 30mins),2.0,,"As seasoned travellers we occasionally get things wrong and this was one of them, not sure why because I dislike zoos in principal although do recognise the job that they do with endangered species.
Anyhow it had been recommended by a few friends and so without reading up about we bought a ""tour"" through the hotel conceige including collection and return to our hotel.
The ""collector"" arrived 30 minutes than we were expecting, a total of two coach changes and we were on our way.
Our tickets were ""priority"" boarding so no lines to board the tram which promised a 40 minute tour. Now admitantly I did not time the tour but but on the basis of when we left and the time left to kill afterwards I would guess at around 30 minutes was nearer the truth.
It could have well been short due to the fact that we saw very few animals and those that we did see were so far away, the tram stops for very short periods to view and then moves on whether we are ready or not.
The only real viewing was of the tiger which of course is behind glass and acting very stressed pacing across the enclosure as they do when stressed. Did not enjoy.
There are walks to be taken through some of the enclosures and again due to my wifes walking issues we were unable to avail ourselves of these so cannot comment.
The only other thing to pass the time until your return coach arrives is either eat or queue for a 800 seat theater with no guarantee of a seat when you get to the end!
As far we could establish they make no concessions for disabled people to attend the show.
They do not allow coaches to park on the drop off zone and for unkown reasons we managed to miss our planned return coach, thankfully their is a 6SS$ option to get back which departs on the hour to town hotel drop offs.
Believe me there are a lot more things to do in Singapore than waste your money and more importantly time on this."
,,Great Nightlife experience!,4.0,,"Had good time experiencing the Zoo at night time. Tram rides were good, it was close to animals display zone. waiting time is long."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Such fun. Trundled around on an open road train. Saw lions tigers and lots more. A little chap was furtively throwing them food to lure them out. Don’t miss it.
,,Really great experience,4.0,,"What an experience!

The night safari is a must do while you are in Singapore - there are a couple of ways to get there as it's not close to the city a) taxi b) HOP on Hop off bus has a route that heads to and from the zoo (but the times are limited)

We got a taxi from the CBD and the trip took about 30 minutes.

There are a few activities on offer on the night: 1. firedance show 2. meet some of the animals show 3. night safari ride 4. walking around the zoo on foot

We experienced all of them and our favourite was the night safari ride itself - there is a guide who commentates along the way as it is dark and the animals can be hard to see - obviously it's random luck if you see all the animals.

Walking around it was hot and humid and we left this as our last activity. There were a few queues at each activity but didn't have to wait for too long - but people seem to know to go from the performance straight to the bus line for the safari."
,,Safari tips!,4.0,,"Truly a victim of its own success but worth visiting- a couple of helpful tips:
Get there early if you prebook (though you don’t have to) and whilst queuing there is a fire performance to pass the time which is excellent. We booked the 9.15pm entry and we finished the whole experience at 11.30pm.
Once through the entrance gates turn right and head to watch the show (most people go for the tram ride at this point). There will probably be another queue but the amphitheatre is huge. The Creatures of the Night Show is great fun!
After the show do not follow the hordes again for the tram ride but go one of the trails (the Wallaby Trail is nearest) and walk around the trails. This has the added advantage of giving you your bearings on the tram ride and, more importantly, avoiding the screaming children mentioned in other posts because just 40 minutes later there will probably be no queue at all! Also we had a peaceful tram ride and saw lots of animals and it was very special.
We also used public transport to get there (Citymapper app is excellent for routings) because we’d bought a 3 day tourist pass for $20 and wanted to make best use of it. The journey took less than an hour from Clarke Quay.
On the way back there was a long queue for taxis (apparently about $30+ per trip downtown) so we paid just $6 each for the two of us for a minibus ride at midnight to Orchard Road (Hyatt Hotel), then there are plenty of night buses to get wherever you want to go."
,,Good experience for kids,5.0,,1st Tips to enter Night Safari must go to watch the shows and 2nd must go experience take tram to visit their tram available English/Chinese version and after you can walk into the walk way after took tram. Just take 2-3 hours ends
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"We had visited the place 10 years ago. The previous Animal Show left us very impressed. The recent revisit, we were very disappointed with the Show. Many performances were missing.Btw, where's the giraffes (silhouette)!"
,,Really fun experience,5.0,,The night safari is good fun to visit at night in Singapore. Something slightly different than visiting the zoo in the day time. Also the shows that are provided are good!
,,Looking forward to visit again!,5.0,,"Place is well kept. Staff are all very friendly and polite. I feel welcomed. Signages are well in place, wont feel lost. A little disappointed that i dont get to see some of the animals. But i guess that's all depending on luck. Overall experience is good. Well done team!"
,,"A unique, educational and fun evening",4.0,,"Unless you have e-tickets, you will have to purchase them at the central ticket office some 250m away down adjacent to the zoo entrance. The queue for the tram ride actually moves q fast so don't be put off by the long lines as you enter. one of the helpful staff will give you an estimate of the wait time. Taking the tram for animal viewing always seems better earlier rather than later. The show was a little more style than substance but worth sitting in on nevertheless. Plenty of F&B after that."
,,Too crowded. Long time waiting.,2.0,,Booked at 8.15 and it took an hour almost to get on the train. I had planned to see the fireworks at the esplanade at 10.00 and almost missed it. Had no time to walk around the zoo after the safari because of all the delays. I used to live in Singapore and it wasn't like this before.
,,A Wonderful and Lovely Experience at the Night Safari,5.0,,"Thank you! It was a lovely experience! I especially love the animal show. Your animals, MC and zookeepers were hilarious and fun and kept us in suspense and laughter with their theatrics. I loved the open range. It was an experience seeing some of these animals close up and realise how big and curious they really were. And the hyenas, though scary, were fascinating. Brought the Lion King to life for me. It was unreal! I feel the need to have a special mention about the lions as well. I usually try to visit the Zoo at least once a year. However, this was my first visit to the Night Safari. Despite this, it is actually the first time that i've seen how majestic the male lion looked. Usually at the Zoo, the lionesses are in full view and seem to be more majestic than the male lion. Maybe cuz they were always sleeping? Haha, anyways, this was the first time that i actually witnessed a male lion sitting up at full attention and looking all majestic like in the documentaries that i watch. :-) Lovely! And the fake buffalo in their den is an excellent attempt to be as true to their natural ways as possible. It was an interesting and wonderful feature. Thank you.I visited with my family consisting of 4 adults and 3 senior citizens (i can only select the category below as Family with teens as there are no other choices), hence though we could not walk much, we enjoyed the tram ride. Just to note, the tram did squeak a bit too much at times that the noise overode the commentary. Other than that tiny, tiny glitch, everything else was lovely."
,,Not worth for time and money,1.0,,There very less animals and the journey is not worth for money and time.This is not my first visit to night safari. I had been there years back. This time though felt it's not worth spending money.
,,Great place to go and enjoyable experience,4.0,,Memorable experience as you walk around in the dark. Place well kept and water cooler available for refills.
,,Save yourself the money and time,1.0,,The concept is cool but...long lines and you can’t see much in darkness. Staff seemed incompetent and didn’t know how to handle large crowds.
,,An unusual and enchanting night zoo experience,5.0,,"As newcomers to Singapore we figured we'd be visiting the zoo a lot, our daughter is mad keen on animals and we expect visitors will want to go so we have bought the annual pass which covers all four of the Singapore Zoo attractions; The Zoo, The River Safari, The Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park. This review covers the Night Safari only.

The night safari opens at 7:15 pm each evening and is open till midnight. It offers the visitor the choice of a tram ride through the park or a walk through the park. Be aware that you need to book your tram ride time slot in advance.

The tram ride is a good opening gambit as the ride quietly guides you past each of the enclosures with a slowdown or a stop at each to get a look at the animals, with the driver giving a running commentary about the animals, their behaviour and their habitat. There is dim lighting available at each location to enable you to see the animals but photography is pretty much a lost cause and flash photography is completely forbidden. That said there is always some dipstick who will attempt to “sneak” a flash photo in.

The tram ride does allow you to alight at a couple of intermediate stops to get a closer look at the animal enclosures adjacent to the tram stop. You can then try to join the next available tram or walk back.

The walk through the night safari takes you through distinct zones and allows you to see exhibits and enclosures you cannot see from the tram as well as take a closer look at the enclosures you can see from the tram. The Lion feeding is particularly good to watch.

The main tram station also has a wide selection of food and beverage options and as with the main zoo, the local cuisine is excellent."
,,Can be ignored or avoided,2.0,,People from India can easily ignore this place. Animals shown here is seen in all Indian zoos and is not a treat to watch.
,,Nothing much,2.0,,"Visited this place during our Singapore trip. I found it is a waste trip, there are not many animals visible. We happened to stand for several hors in the queue. There is a show but is was also just average. It need to be improved a lot. They can add more interesting things."
,,Must Visit place,5.0,,I would love to go here again and again!! This was one of the best experience of my visit to Singapore. This is like open Tram ride across Jungle with all the Animals on your left and Right roaming openly(mostof them) including Lion and Leopard. We saw white Lion & Lioness. This was lifetime experience and you cannot miss it!!!
,,Amazing expereince,5.0,,Had an amazing experience.It was fun to see the animal habitat during the night time.Almost saw all the animals in the zoo
,,My idea of Hell,1.0,,"Worst attraction in Singapore. Bought 8:15 tickets. Queued for over an hour with about three thousand people whilst listening to non-stop Chinese New Year music belting out of speakers the entire time. Finally got on a vehicle only to have the entire 40min experience ruined by non-compliant, ignorant and stupid people who ignored the instructions to be quiet and not use flash photography. Staff did nothing to address this. Saw hardly any animals and then had to wait an hour in the taxi rank because Grab had no drivers. If you want my advice, stay in your hotel, have a cold beer and watch National Geographic Channel."
,,Dissappointing,3.0,,"Was over too quickly. no time to appreciate the animals moving around. Then the night show, well took far too long to seat hundreds of people. Then idots who don't know how to turn of flashes spoit the show. Arena is too big for such a show, ban cameras!"
,,Singapore Zoo,4.0,,We did the night Safari. It was really nice experience. You can’t compare it to Massai Mara but still you will have an idea. I will definitely do it again but this time day safari.
,,Great night life at night safari,4.0,,"Truly a spectacular views of the nocturnal animals where they r mostly resting or sleeping during the day at the zoo, u can see them come alife at the night version.

Tram rides are a must as certain trails are prohibited by foot.bettee off taking the tram rides for the 1st round. Than u can enjoy the trails on foot especially if u like to see the leopards, wild cats, crocs, etc.
Snacks n food are aplenty at the entrances and there are some small eateries along the trails.
Animal shows are usually super crowded with long queues so be early if u like to catch the shows."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"I had a great time at the night Safari. I booked my ticket online in advance. I got there using the shuttle bus from the MRT station which was easy.

Once in I started queueing for the tram but it was taking ages, so decided to do the walking trail first. This was great, I saw a great variety of animals and most were active. You can go in enclosures with bats and flying squirrels.

After I had done the walking trail I took the tram ride. This time there was barely anyone queuing. The tram takes a different route so you see different animals.

I really enjoyed my visit, the animals were well cared for and seemed happy. There were gift shops and restaurants on site too.
Definitely do the walking tour first and then come back to the tram when the queues have died down.

It’s a good idea to book your taxi in advance. I left the Safari at 11pm and there were no grabs, I had missed the shuttle bus and the queue for taxis was awfully long. I was lucky to get a taxi, as after the next one to mine there was a wait of 45 mins."
,,A lifetime experience,4.0,,"Visited the night safari with my husband and kids. It was a wonderful experience. Probably we went in the peak season so there was wait in each attraction but was well organized by the staff. Lots of restaurants, cafes , souvenir shops so you really can’t get bored here. This place has so much to offer.

I was very excited about the show but it was nothing amazing! Can be a lot better! I mean make it worth the wait for people.

The tramp ride was awesome and a lifetime experience for every age group. The place is so well maintained and you get to see the animals in their own natural habitat for good 45 minutes.

If you are in Singapore this place is a must visit with your kids, parents and even grand parents."
,,Great time,5.0,,I has a great time. Was one of the last activities I did whilst In Singapore. Great Zoo great place!
,,Loved it,4.0,,My husband and I had a great time here and it was really really efficient. Saw loads of animals and it was well worth it.
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"Well worth the effort. Go early to see the attraction show. Be patient, follow the rules and keep Singapore clean and beautiful."
,,It's ok,3.0,,"It's ok, it's the most popular attraction so it's very busy. It's a hassle to get to however you do it. Taxi was easiest for us as a family of 4. Pay extra for the tram and jump the queue, we didn't it was quite a queue. The Tram goes quickly because so many people are waiting. Good place, huge enclosures for animals. Just not brilliant."
,,bad,2.0,,"This lines were way to long we waited for over 2 hours. The place was over crowded, highly disappointed."
,,Over-rated,1.0,,"Expensive, a few poor and bored animals and a long way between exhibits. Not easy to see anything from the “train” and numerous stupid people who kept using flash with their cameras and phones even when told not to for the umpteenth time"
,,Poor content,2.0,,"47$ is too much to see the structured process of handling things. As the main attraction was soo poor, also the nightshow was also not attractive. The only show in Singapore which was not value for money so far I have seen."
,,Great customer service!,5.0,,"Was there on an evening with a friend and unfortunately it started pouring, resulting in cancellation of all shows. The reception lady (Ogy) was very friendly and helped us revalidate the ticket for another date. She was verty passionate in delivering great service to us and we were very satisfied with her service. Thank you!"
,,New experience to see animals by night,3.0,,"Overall interesting, but very crowded and not much guidance about where to go or what to do. Hard to do with young kids.

Went on Sunday night. Used a Grab car from Chinatown for about $20. Booked tickets via Klook app. 7.15pm booked out. Went at 8.15pm.

Very crowded. My recommendation is to do a self-guided walk or watch a show first. Avoid the massive queue for the tram which we did first. Took about 1 hour waiting, so after the tram tour, our young kids were very tired, the shows were pretty much finished and we just got to stroll around a bit.

By 10pm the queue to the tram is very short.

It is very dark. You'll struggle with a smartphone to take any good pictures. Forget about it from the tram which is moving and rarely stops completely. You'll need an SLR, fast lens and a tripod as you walk around.

A long queue at 10.30pm for taxis. We made a poor choice and took the shuttle bus to the MRT station Khatib (last one leaves at 10.40pm). The trip to nearest MRT station is actually about 20 minutes by this bus, and we did not make it back to the city until 11.50pm. Suffice it to say kids exhausted. Should have just used taxi.

Definitely get absolute earliest tickets (7.15pm) if you have young kids and make tram trip last thing you do (after 9.30pm)."
,,It was ok,3.0,,"The safari itself was ok. Its hard to see the animals depending where you sit and after the long lines, it feel very anticlimactic. The lines are also very very long, we stood in line for almost an hour, even after having tickets for a specific time"
,,Super helpful staff,5.0,,"Great concept, friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend to anyone to visit. Well laid out, informative, easy to get transport afterwards. A special thanks to Armiz? for helping my daughter out"
,,Fantastic Safari,5.0,,Don't take the tram! Walk...you'll see much more and avoid the crowds! A great experience with some cute animals!
,,ENTERTAINMENT AND RESTAURANT,3.0,,"Ticket is expensive. No much entertainment, a few animal unseen during the tram ride. The most shocking part is the food,price is killing!!Lucky me it's a 7yrs one time visit.The total amount spent there is equivalent to Batam3d2n staycation."
,,Fantastic Family Night,5.0,,Great organisation. The tour was amazing and great for small children. We had a child in a wheel chair and accessibility was great.
,,Excellent with lots of animals to see,4.0,,Great fun for all with lots of food and beverage outlets. The audio on the tram ride needs improving and people need to LISTEN to the no flash photography requests...!!!
,,Great for a walk,5.0,,"Fun, easy-going trail through the Night Safari. Don't expect to see all the animals but it was a great change of pace from the adjacent Singapore Zoo. Restaurants served fancy versions of local fare -- fancy prices too but at least they tasted good. Bring breathable clothing but don't forget the mozzie repellent."
,,Review of night safari,5.0,,"Its an awesome Zoo. One should experience watching wildlife at Night. There are two options either folks can go for a zoo visit by oneself after entering the zoo premises or can opt for a tram which takes u around the zoo for about 40 -50 mins approximately. My suggestion is to opt for a tram ride which covers all the places where in one can sit back, relax and enjoy the wildlife. You can also encounter the trained wildlife show which is good. Its a thorough entertainment package, though it appears to be scary it's extremely safe!!"
,,Mesmerizing,4.0,,It was a unique experience to see the animals so close. They were barely a few feet away and you never get to see them in their natural habitat like these animals were living.
,,Great experience,5.0,,We did this as part of 4 Park option ticket. You MUST do this if you can. It is a really different experience to be in a zoo at night rather than the daytime. Very special thing to do.
,,Great idea. Excellent execution,5.0,,"What a way to experience wildlife. Relaxed tram ride through the night zoo, and saw some amazing animals. My kids had a blast. Highly recommended."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Joined a tour of the Night Safari. Heard a lot about it but slightly disappointed at the tour. A bit short
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"We went to the night zoo for my daughters 13th Birthday treat. It was everything we could have wanted. The team made it easy to negotiate the zoo, however I’d suggest skipping the tram when you first arrive and walk round, the trams run until 11:20pm and are much quieter (and more animals had come out) later in the night. The creatures of the night show was great fun and the keeper who hosted it was fantastic. It’s a tiring night we stayed to closing so make sure children are well rested before you go as you’ll not want to leave early!"
,,Night time safari,5.0,,"Really looked foward to this night out however the crowds where unbelievable ,better managed would have been great .
Going to the auditorium was chaos .but the presentation was great and a delight for the younger children .seats are hard .
Onto the train OMG .once again chaos pushing and shoving .
Once seated it was well done and informative
Worth doing but try and figure out when to go and miss the crowds"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,We had an amazing time at the Night Safari. First we went on a 40 minute tram ride around the zoo & then went on a walk around all 4 trails.
,,Well done Singapore,4.0,,"For such a small country they have done a lot of good hsrd work to preserve nature. The night tour guides were well informed and made the trip wonderfull experience. Due to ban on flash fotography we took no foto's on the drive. The animals have ""open"" areas without normal fences that makes the interaction a novel experience. The night ride took about 45 minutes and was followed with an animal demonstration."
,,A great night out,5.0,,"A must try, get the priority ticket to avoid long queues. Fire show was amazing at the end. Expect delay of up to 20 minutes for pickup."
,,Not bad,4.0,,I am not sure what I expected but the night safari didn't exactly rattle my cage. Traipsing around in the dark down trails in the rain wasn't my idea of a great night out but the kids liked it. The bus is very informative and the entertainment in the eating area was great
,,This is a wet jungle,5.0,,"We had such a great time on the little train going around, looking at all the cute animals who were locked up in their jail cells"
,,Always enlarging and getting bigger,4.0,,"Significantly expanded since our last visit. 10 yrs ago. A lot more trails and walking now. Trams don’t seem to make any stops along the way any more. So you can’t hop on/off like you used to. Ie if you walk to the other side of the park, you have to walk back. That said, still a good experience.
Lines are huge by 630 ( for 715 entry) and gates actually opened at 655 on our day. We were inside the “creatures of the night shoe by just after 7.
Multitude of food options outside zoo so can have dinner between day zoo/ river safari and night safari."
,,"Great way to see the animals, the tram ride the highlight. Expected more of the show, but overall a fun experience.",4.0,,"The tram ride around the Singapore Night Safari was excellent - guided by a useful and interesting narration, the 30-40 min trip covers a range of interesting exhibits. My favourites were the Asian elephants, the pride of lions and the sloth bear. The low light adds to a sense of surprise as you can't really see which animals will come next. It's a different way to explore a zoo, and I really liked it. On the downside, the low light can make it hard to see some of the creatures, and makes photography very difficult.
We also saw the 'Creatures of the Night' show which was, unfortunately, a little underwhelming. The host was funny and engaging, but I was expecting a little more in terms of the number of type animals featured.
Like most major attractions in Singapore, it was very crowded. The show was at full capacity at least 15-20 min before it started and lines to ride the tram were long. Recommend you get there early and do the tram ride first.
Overall, it's well worth a visit. The tram ride was the clear highlight."
,,Avoid weekend!,2.0,,"Please be aware that when you are entering the park you are assigned a time for the tour by bus. We arrived at 7 pm on a Saturday and we could only take the bus tour at 9.15 pm. We could not entered the park and do the foot trails before! You can jump the queue by paying extra 10. Tour bus last 40 minutes. You have also 3 other trails by foot. Of course it is dark with low light so pictures are difficult to take. Yes animals are quite close to you. Saw a male white lion, tigger, elephants ...For me the male elephant looked stressed as he was was balancing from side to side. What did I expect? At the end It is just a zoo in a beautiful surroundings but in the dark!"
,,"Great animals, bad tourists",3.0,,"I LOVE the concept of this place. They have some fantastic animals and I do believe conservation is top of the agenda, although they obviously have to make a profit.

The tram is cool, but it's dark and you have to accept you're not going to see everything, but most animals are visible and there is low level lighting. We were part of a tour so we got straight on the tram, but the queues were long for most.

We also caught the fire show, which I thought was great, and the night time critters show too. More aimed at kids, but the host (Friday 25th Jan) did a great job under the circumstances, which I'll get to.

The place is far busier than I thought it would be, but given the aim of what they're doing that's a good thing, and it's pretty easy to get to and good value.

Here's my issue; stupid, horrible, ignorant tourists. How many times to people need to be told not to use flash photography? Apparently it doesn't matter how many times. It ruins it for others who are being respectful and considerate of the animals, and can have harmful consequences.

The fire show was brilliant and had a decent sized crowd. But despite the efforts of the performers, the audience just doesn't seem to care. May be a tough audience for that particular show, but I would have thought on a Friday evening people who be a bit more up for it! A real shame I thought as they were great but I ended up feeling a bit bad for them.

Same thing with the critters show. It's a great idea, great bunch of colleagues and great animals. But it's the humans that ruin it. No flash photography, please stay seated and stay until the end as animals appear from everywhere - very simple rules that people just can't follow. Particularly ignorant when people are getting up and walking out when it's only a 25 minute show anyway.

TLDR: great concept, great staff, great animals, great shows. Ignorant tourists who will gladly do their best to ruin it."
,,Night Safari Tour,5.0,,"the trip was really good - worth itgreat seeing the animals in the dark, but not all were active. think we should have done the train trip on arrival and then do the shows, feel dusk would have given us a better view than the dark. Didn't feel confident walking around the park in the dark so didn't do view the extra animals that were not on the train track.only downfall was was queuing up with hundreds of others waiting for the gates to open in the heat. No place to sit for those not 100%"
,,Exceeded expectations,5.0,,"Everyone who had done this safari recommended it so off we went. What we had been told did not really prepare us for the actual experience. We went as extended family (family aged from 9 - 75) on New Year's Eve. None of us ended up doing the 'shows': we did tr for the latest show but missed a seat as we did not expect we would need to be early to get one! We had no trouble spending 2-3 hours just walking the trail which was well designed. We met animals we had never seen before and learnt so much about their natural habitat, preservation status etc. It was really well done! Thank you Singapore Zoo for both educating and entertaining us! The only down side was arriving at the exit very hungry and with lots of food at the eateries sold out!"
,,Great time at Night Safari,5.0,,"Had such a great time ,enjoyed every minute of it, the tour guides where so helpful and gave great information on the animals. feeding the elephants was such a great experience , now back home have told everyone on how good it was. worth paying the extra money so you do not have to wait in the queue and have an up close and personal tour with the animals."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,Unique close encounters with the nocturnal animals rarely experienced elsewhere in modern big cities! My highlight was lion feeding frenzy and otter show!
,,Always a highlight,5.0,,The Night Safari is a unique Singapore experience. I have been several times over the year with visiting friends and family. It’s always well done and an enjoyable experience.
,,Not all animals out and about,4.0,,"We went along to the Night Safari following recommendations from quite a few of our friends who had been along before. For the most part it was a great experience. The automated commentary was interesting and relevant, and some of the species on show are very unique animals. The 2 male lions in particular were absolutely breath taking. They were sat perched over their estate watching the world go by and were just stunning.The only criticism we have is that with it being a night event, it's difficult for the zoo to ensure you see everything, so there were a few displays that looked empty. If you only have time for one zoo visit, I'd recommend doing the Orangutan breakfast over the Night Safari. You get to see more, it's more interactive, and you have the opportunity to explore the zoo afterwards"
,,Singapore Night Safair,5.0,,"Loved this plate, well organised, big queues flowed smoothly, whipped around in a very organised way, got to see lots. Very helpful smiley people."
,,Just ok!,3.0,,We were very excited about the night safari but was a bit disappointed not to see so many animals as expected but as it’s night time and maybe our luck we didn’t get to see most of the animals as they were either sleeping or hiding somewhere in the bush. Not worth the visit and the time invested.
,,Amazing Experience!,5.0,,"No words, was something else, never seen anything like this before. I would recommend a mist see if your in Singapore."
,,A different experience,5.0,,"It was a totally new experience for me. Even couldn't imagine to go a zoo into the night. A must visit during your Singapore trip. Battery operated car will take you to close to the animals. Deer are just a hands away. Roaming tiger (glass barrier exist) , Lion , Rhino are making the atmosphere really adventurous.
I want to specially mention the starting animal show which will run for 1 hour. It is really an amazing event."
,,Close encounter to the animals,5.0,,"Nice Zoo open during the dark hours. Exciting walking aorund the area in the dark - feels you are very close to animals and in some areas there is no fence at all. You can go with a ""train"" around the park with some guideing. Also the show was very nice to watch. Afterwards there is time to take a photo with the owls. I missed the feeding of the tigers since it was at the same time as the show."
,,Amazing evening at the Night Safari,5.0,,We had a fantastic time at the Night Safari with our 2 young boys - they loved the tram and the show that we went too.
,,"Skip this attraction, not worth the time or money. So disappointing!",1.0,,"This was the most disappointing attraction we saw in Singapore. Not only is it a little out of the way to get there from the city center but since you are going at night you also have to deal with rush-hour traffic on weeknights. The Night Safari tram ride itself lasted only 25-30 minutes and you only see a few animals, nothing extraordinary, it's also fairly dark so it's hard to see much. I was hoping after the tram ride you would have to opportunity to see other animals like at the zoo but unfortunately, there's nothing else to do there besides eat at the food court or catch a small show with performers twirling fire torches. I think you're better off visiting the regular zoo in the day time. I would definitely recommend skipping this attraction and saving your money to do something else."
,,Night Safari every visit,5.0,,"I love the zoo but love night safari every time I visit Singapore.

We have done the 7.15 tour the last two visits and think it is the best time because the animals were all eating and visible during our visits. The show can be ‘corny’ but it is enjoyable.

We find the food good as any food market. Yes maybe more expensive but, so is food at any entertainment venue.

If you have smaller kids, give them a long nap in the day so you aren’t carrying sleeping babies."
,,Really glad we did this,4.0,,"With a 5 year old in tow, this night time activity had me wondering whether the experience would be picturesque or painful.
Thankfully, family reviews on TripAdvisor steered me the right way. We organised a bus tour from our hotel which meant no queues or late night return taxi concerns . I believe the extra $10 skip the Line fee is an essential option for families with young kids . The night Safari was a very peaceful experience. The tram ride was relaxing and most animals were active and very visible. Rain stopped our walking trail adventures but this was still a recommended experience. My tip is to come later if possible as lines were very quiet and you avoid the shocking peak hour traffic."
,,Adelaide Australia,3.0,,Night Safari was mentioned to us as a must to see by a previous visitor to Singapore. The meet n greet of animals at dusk was very good but then we felt let down by the train ride around complex that only half the animals were out to see. Staff were helpful.
,,Excellent Night Out,5.0,,"Came here as it recommended to us. Was not disappointed, it's like nothing on earth. Great commentary and view of the nocturnal animals. Highly recommended!"
,,Nice place..,5.0,,Fantastic place...love it every time I visit. Animals were great..and the tram ride was eventful. Will make another visit soon.
,,Night safari,4.0,,"The show in the evening was amazing, great people giving us a taste of the animals, who were well behaved. The safari itself was OK, good to see animals in the night and get a glimpse"
,,Good entertainment,4.0,,The night safari is good way of seeing a variety of nocturnal animals up close and in a more natural environment rather than a cage.A good place to take the kids or go on your own.We also caught the Creatures of the night show and the Thumbuakar warrior fire show.All up it made for a very entertaining experience.
,,Good place for kids,4.0,,This is nice place specially for kids. You have opportunity to see animals in night but sometimes it is difficult to see all. Also they have show also which is worth watching. We had dinner at ulu ulu restaurant which is not great. I will suggest you have dinner some where else.
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,It was a different experience for us seeing nocturnal animals. We surely want to get back. My daughter enjoyed the tour
,,Should be renamed The Night Zoo,2.0,,Having booked both the zoo and the night safari we felt a little disappointed by the night safari. We opted for the 7:15 show first which is more aimed at children than adults... we rushed to watch the lion feed to find out it was only on Friday’s and Saturday’s which was also disappointing.If this was every night it would increase the customers satisfaction and might encourage the lions to wake up... i would advise only do one of this or the zoo and i think i would pick the zoo
,,Poor - not worth it,2.0,,"We attended the 8pm slot and the night safari started off well, there wasn't much of a queue and we were able to get seats on the tram tour within minutes. The tram ride around the safari was nice despite the annoying couple sat behind who were repeatedly taking flash photography despite being asked not to do so by the guide sat upfront.The issue started as soon as we got off the tram. The staff were loudly advertising and encouraging everyone to start queuing for the night show else we would miss out. We did exactly that, queuing for 45mins and when we sat down and waited a further 15mins, we were told the show was cancelled due to rain which caused safety issues. By this point it was 10pm and the experience was starting to turn a little flat.To make it worse, the guides were doing exactly the same with the new set of tourists who had just come off the tram and encouraging them to queue for the next show. To make the most of the time left, we went on some of the walking routes which again was pleasant but nothing to get excited about. Overall a very disappointing experience and not worth the SGD 250 paid for all of us."
,,Interesting but Not Exceptional,3.0,,"A must see on many tourist guides. Definitely fun and interesting but you share with the masses. Standing in line for about an hour before boarding the Tram for a 40 minute ride. Not well controlled, as some passengers were using flashes to blind other passengers and animals alike. It’s supposed to come with a show but that was going to another hour wait so we skipped. If you’re from the west. You will see many new species."
,,Nothing like the photo advertisements,3.0,,"We did the night Safari tour, however being between Christmas and New year it was so busy, and I believe they over sold the tickets! The lines to get on the tram to take you around would have taken over an hr standing to get on which meant you would miss the show and the other animals in the park. We opted for the show which was really well done and then walked around the park and although there are 2500 animals in the park, we only seen a few as was too dark to see them or they weren’t out. I was disappointed even though I think the work that has gone into the Singapore zoo and still i unbelievable I do feel that if we had done the tram and seen the other animals it may have been better, what we experienced was nothing like the photos that are advertised of the park., should be a limit on tickets sold to allow everyone to be able to enjoy the park. Even the lines to get tickets and get in were over the top."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Although it was extremely busy (we went on boxing day) everything was really well organised.
We started with the tram tour and were amazed by how up close you actually get to some of the animals (the tapirs were just over an inch away from the tram).
The tram tour was in English and it was rather informative and not boring at all.
We also went for a walk around the zoo and were really impressed by the giant flying squirrels!
The elephants could have done with a larger enclosure but they seemed well looked after.
Plenty of shops and restaurants on site."
,,Disastrous,1.0,,It was very very bad not liked it at all because the lion was so lethargic that when we visited the safari the lion was sleeping and the other one was yawning.The tiger was good but it was kept in a cage.There were everywhere deer roaming around .
,,Thrilling experience with all the nocturnal animals.,5.0,,"Tram ride at night when all the animals are out in the dark. They can't see you but you can. Different animals from across the globe which I had seen for the first time. elephants, hyenas, white elephant, lions, tigers, armadillos etc were moving around without a cage. You can also move around on feet and check them out from a distance. After that you can enjoy your dinner and relax."
,,Good Visit but spoilt by South Asian tourists,3.0,,"The experience at the Night Safari has always been good and it is a great place to bring friends from overseas. The visit this time round was no different when I brought my Indian Friends there.

There were however a couple of negatives that marred the experience - it was Nov and it poured the afternoon before we visited. Thus the humidity was a tat uncomfortable. Also, there was too many visitors from South Asia who cannot seemed to take heed of the repeated advisories not to use flash photography until the Safari ranger had to “threaten” to ask them to leave."
,,Night Safari Experience,4.0,,"It’s worth trying it, yet the trailer trip not so many animals to see, and the night vision of the animals is not so clear due to being a night experience and it’s a bit dark. The seated show got delayed due to rain, and the animals showed are not of that big variety or quality ( a snake, baby bear, and couple if birds and squirrels, as I remember)."
,,Great family activity!,4.0,,"We took 3 jetlagged kids to Night Safari and it started to pour just as we left the hotel. Even our Grab driver chuckled and queried why we were still going. I was expecting it to be a dud and had prepared myself to watch our AUD180 go (literally) down the drain. It actually turned out to be an amazing night.

We bought tickets online to avoid the queues and arrived just before 8.15pm. The lines for the tram was massive. We were also devastated to find that the Creatures of the Night Show was cancelled due to the downpour. But we were determined to make the most of it and we put on our ponchos and headed out to do the trails. We had read other reviews which suggested to come back later to the trams as the lines will be better later in the night.

My kids were exhausted but we had a good time. There were some exhibits we couldnt see (or couldnt find the animals) as a result of the rain but we did see a few good ones. We waited around for the lion, bear and hyena feeding times. It was great and the guide was very enthusiastic and informative. By then the rain had slowed down and to our delight we found out that the Creatures of the NIght show MAY be on as long as the rain stayed away.

We watched the show. For adults - it was ok but it was amazing for the kids. We then caught one of the last trams around the park and it was actually a really pleasant surprise! We saw a lot more animals (up close) in the other parts of the zoo we didn't have access to through the trails. It ended up being a lovely night for us and the rain actually meant there were less mozzies.

Great experience for kids (and adults) so highly recommend it. Don't be put off by bad weather. Bring a raincoat and play it by the ear. Definitely do the trails first and show and then the tram last.

Taxi or Grab is the best way to get there but hard to get a grab going back."
,,Something very Different,5.0,,I have been on several Safaris in National Parks world over but this Night Safari is unique. Its managed extremely well - conducted professionally and you get to see familiar animals in a completely different perspective. Most Safaris do not allow you to enter the Game Reserves during the night but here you get to see the animals during the night time in their natural habitat. Not to be missed - strongly recommended for all visitors to Singapore.
,,A lovely experience,4.0,,"We went with a big family group, there were 14 of us. One elderly couple, three younger couples and six teenagers.We had a evening. I would just like to comment that it is not clear from the website how the time slots work. This would have been helpful.We were lucky enough to meet Mr. Wong Choon Da mien who looked after us extremely well. Thank you."
,,Highlight of my trip to Asia,5.0,,"We did the Zoo, River Safari, and Night Safari in one day. The Zoo was great, the River Safari was okay, but the Night Safari was awesome!! Yes--It's crowded and as Americans, we are used to our personal space, which you will not get there. For the Night Safari, you have to select a time for your ticket entry and they will not let you in until you designated time. First ticket time is 7 p.m., but we had 8 p.m. They lined us up about 30 minutes before our designated time. You wait to go through the first part to then be held in a second line where you also wait. Then at your designated time, they open the second gate and you can either walk the path, get in the line for the tram (which for us still had people in line from the 7 p.m. entrants), or you can go to the Night Show. There were two shows. We decided to do the show first at 8:30 p.m., which meant we waiting in another line. It is first come, first serve so you need to decide which thing you are going to do so you can go straight there. The Night Show was about 25 minutes and pretty cute. The guy was great. The animals were interesting and were not forced to do anything. They have been trained to do tricks. One of the animals chose not to do his trick, which was cute in itself. After the show, we go in the line for the tram, which at this point moved pretty quickly. We took the 45 minute tour around the park listening to the automated recording as you passed by each animals enclosure. Lots of animals were out at night. It was great. Then my husband and I decided to walk the trail. At first we were only going to do a little bit of it, but after we started walking, we ending up walking the entire place. I liked riding the tram, then walking it. You saw a lot of the same things, but since the tram is on a road and the walking is on a path, you don't see everything on both. The only unfortunate part was since it was dark, our pictures did not come out well. That was kind of okay as it forced us to just enjoy the animals. My only complaint was with the tiger. He paced A LOT. I don't know if it was because people we taking pictures (with flash--which they told everyone not to do A LOT), if his enclosure didn't allow for enough space or whether that was his normal behavior. He paced and walked in the same circular path. None of the other animals did that. The rest seemed very relaxed and enjoying life. Overall though, it was absolutely a favorite of mine. That and an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. Highly recommend this, but either get your ticket for the earliest time or later when there are less people."
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,I found the queues for the train to go around the park were extremely large and slow. There seemed to be very little organisation in the queuing system.
,,Too Short,2.0,,The Night Safari was very short and the trolley barely stopped. very hard to get a good look at the animals. Not work the price for a 20 min ride.
,,Entertaining and Educational Experiance,3.0,,"Had higher expectations. I felt that tourists are exploited in that it's more of a process to get the crowd in and out with a weak live presentation. Very crowded with long ques. They could have done so much more considering the infrastructure in place and the general ambiance... Also it felt like some of the animals were not real.. Only where the enclosures were sponsored had live animals.. Its simply another tourist attraction that lacks the long lasting ""got to do"" feeling"
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"We have been able to see all animals.It took some time waiting in the queue, however it is globally well managed.We would be pleased to come again."
,,Below expectations,3.0,,The performance was quite fast - about 10 secs per viewing point. Closer to the end our bus was broken.
,,Good fun for kinds but would have been better to see more animals,3.0,,"We had booked the Night Safari tickets online & the booking was very convenient. Once we reached there, there was a long queue which got shortened quickly (they have number of vehicles & therefore it doesn't take too much time for the queue to get over). Once we were in the night safari (it is a big open bus), we went into the zoo/safari with a predefined running commentary telling us what were the animals that we were looking at. It was almost 40-45 minute Safari in that open bus. Now, let me tell you the pros & cons:Pros:1. New experience which we don't get to see at many places2. Very well managed even after heavy crowd (we were there in last week of December)Cons:1. Too few animals & therefore I felt the safari is overpriced.2. They try to make money from the photographs & photos are just too expensive.3. Apart from 1 tiger, no other wild cats were seen.4. Most of the time, the visibility levels were very very low.5. If possible, they should merge Night Safari & River Safari and have combined tickets for them."
,,Impressive wild animals,5.0,,"The place offers great opportunity to see wild animals like lions, bears, elephants, hyenas, buffalos very close and in the nature. The downside was that even with pre-booked tickets we had to queue for 1 hour to seat on the safari bus and more than 1 hours in the taxi queue to get back to the hotel. There are nice cafes there also"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"General layout of safari was good, however the lighting of the individual habitat was a little too dark.Clever illumination system might be enhancing the whole experiences to the next level."
,,Dont waste time or money,1.0,,"Was really looking forward to this experience. It was an utter waste of time and money. We had the 830 session, after waiting 50 mins we finally got on a tram. This was 920pm... we sat on it for 40 mins to see pure darkness and a few animals here and there. Couldnt get any decent photos due to the darkness and unability to use flashes. Wont recommend this to anyone"
,,Different experience,4.0,,"Interesting attraction for kids for sure as I have seen them excited during the visit.
Place is good with restaurants and shopping areas which good to spend sometime after the visit.

It is very important to listen to information during the ride in terms of following which helped to spot the animals in the night. Some of them were very close to trail while others are difficult to see (wild animals) which is normal.

It was an opportunity to see few animals I did not see before.

On the other side, location is quite far hence booking a round trip transportation was really convenient and comfortable for us to be picked up from nearest location of our hotel and drop back.

Outside there are areas to take some pictures, during the attraction taking a picture might distract the focus of vision in the night. Hence, I would say just enjoy it."
,,A bit less than anticipated,3.0,,"The night safari is very popular in Singapore and with tourists. We got our tickets online and made it there by taxi as with the MRT and bus it's a bit complicated. The taxi costs us about 30 SD from the Marina Sands. Driving along witht the trams, à la Jurassic world, is okay although because of the darkness it's not always easy to see the animals which can be lying far away from the track. You can't force these animals to pose for pictures so you will just need some luck. The tram takes about 20 minutes. Afterwards you can go on 4 hiking trails which all together will take you about an hour and a half and will take you again past the same animals which you already saw with the tram plus a couple of extra animals they throw in. It's okay but there are sooooo many people it feels really touristy and to our opinion it's a bit overrated. The smaller kids will probably love it though."
,,Short and compact,3.0,,I was expecting to see animals that are more coomonly found at night rather than animals that we could see during the day like the ones in Singapore Zoo. Even so the tram ride was interesting as we covered area that’s beyond walking path. Advisable to walk through the park and end your visit with a tram ride.
,,"Crowded, but worthwhile",4.0,,"A good activity for the evening, I'd recommend to any families or couples, quite a few places to eat there. A lot of queuing up, but I think that's normal for tourist attractions in Singapore. Easy access to to venue using ride share services."
,,Hard to see,3.0,,"The concept to see nocturnal animals at night is nice but physically hard to see animals in the dark. The tram is open and easy to look around. Lights in the animal area are not bright enough, providing animals natural environment.
Animal show is exactly opposite to the tram tour. Animals on the show would have been trained, seemed disturbed by audience. Tram routes are dark to protect animals from disturbance, then what about the animals on the show? Don't they deserve protection from audience?"
,,over crowed,2.0,,"30 minutes wait to get the pre-purchased tickets, 45 minutes wait to enter the show, an hour wait to get to the train ride."
,,Be prepared for a lot of queueing!,2.0,,"For the amount of waiting that you do, the tram wasnt as great as I'd thought it would be. If you have little kids, be prepared to wait to get tickets, then queue again to get through the gate then queue agin to get on the tram - worse than queueing for Disney! We arrived about 7.15 and got on the tram at 10.30pm. But once on the tram (about 1/2 hr ride) we saw a few cool animals like the white lion and the tigers."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,Too expensive 47 Singapore dollars Did not see too may different animalsI would not recommend itThe animals were in the dark also
,,Long waiting time for tram,2.0,,We went on Christmas Eve. Very crowded with locals and tourists alike. Long wait time to board trams. Trams seem frequent but waiting in the humidity was not enjoyable. Singapore Zoo was more fascinating.
,,Humid park but well maintained,5.0,,It doesn’t seem to get any cooler in the evening but the park is easy to navigate. It is definitely worth the extra $10 for the priority boarding for the tram if you have young children who can’t tolerate the humidity and crowd well.
,,We love you too protect animals,5.0,,"We love you too protect animals, we love the experience in the night, thats different,very thank you"
,,Fun different experience,5.0,,"Think lion country safari at night. Definitely commercial however also supporting animal preservation, the environment and its fun."
,,Very enjoyable,5.0,,This is our 2nd time visiting the Night Safari and everyone loved it. Parking was easy and staff are always helpful and friendly.
,,Hope can spend more time,3.0,,Hope can spend more time due too many tourist in weekday. Everything need queue waste lots of time and i bring along child not that easy with the crowd and queue
,,great memories,4.0,,"we're really glad we've done this night safari, many good memories for the kids & us.just bare in mind that the waiting time to get on the train can be very long, and some visitors can be very loudy once on the train, making it very difficult for you to catch the explanation if you are seated next to them"
,,"Impressive in the ad, but nothing special in reality",3.0,,"Dont expect too much. Unless you havent been to any other zoo or night safari. Otherwise, skip this visit."
,,Madness,1.0,,"Overwhelming number of people, systems were not clear and the que went for miles and hours.The experience once in the park was delightful. Would I do it again .. no. The negative of trying to get in and Que with thousands of people outwayed the positive experience."
,,Nice place,3.0,,The safari time was very short in compare with time been spent in queue beforahead. Most probably due to many people were attending the zoo during Mew Year Holliday. But any how the establishment is amazing generally.
,,Busy but enjoyable,4.0,,"Although the process of getting tickets was not as smooth, and there were a lot of people when we visited, the variety of animals was very enjoyable, and the park seems to be optimised for letting large groups of people walk around. Furthermore, the staff in the park was very helpful and abundant throughout the park. I think the 'party beach'-like shows with loud music and flamethrowers where a bit off, for a zoo."
,,A must see if visiting Singapore,5.0,,"My wife and I visited the this attraction on 29th December. When booking you have to choose a slot, the 7:15 was very busy so we chose the 8:15. There was a very cheap and convenient bus that picked us up directly from our hotel which cost roughly £5 for a return ticket. On arrival we were greeted with the usual long queue, souvenir shops, and food and drink stands. It didn’t take too long to get in, maybe 15 minutes. Once in you then have a choice to take the tram tour first, or head out on foot. I recommend you do both as there are some things you won’t see if you only take one or the other. We decided to walk first, where it becomes a lot less busy. Attractions include giant bats, flying foxes, insects, hyenas, and much more. Don’t be surprised if you don’t see all the animals, as it’s dark, it’s incredibly hard to see some of them if they are hiding. The tram ride is very entertaining depending on the tour guide you get. I recommend you sit at the front, our driver seemed to do his own commentary for those on the front, and he was very entertaining. On the tram ride you see elephants, many types of Deer, rhino, and much more.It was a lovely trip out, however as with any trip in Asia, be prepared to be surrounded by loud Chinese people snorting and spitting everywhere. Ive lived in Hong Kong before, but I still never got used to it. Also it’s a shame tourists thought it necessary to bring very young kids and babies to this attraction. We had screaming kids that the parents couldn’t control which was frustrating - I recommend you go as late as possible to avoid this.All in all - it’s lovely to see the animals at night, and it’s also great that the Night Safari invest of lot of their profits into animal conservation. They make it very clear on the tour the destruction humans have caused to natural habitats, and mention the evils of poaching (but stop short of actually blaming the Chinese and Africans for the their use of “traditional medicines” and Ivory which feeds this disgusting business).Definitely go and see this if you have time. Top tip - take mosquito repellent!"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"This was my third visit to the zoo over the last few years and to be honest I was very disappointed. As per usual the staff were fantastic and supportive. But due to the high number of people at the park on the night we waited for 30 to 40 minutes for both the show and the tram tour. After waiting in line for such a long time we only saw seven different types of animals for the show, and on the actual Safari tour, our tram suffered a breakdown and because it was quite late most the animals were tucked up and sound asleep. For for this trip I felt the price of the ticket we certainly did not get value at all. I was there with a couple of first timers and they were very disappointed."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"If you've never been, then you should try it. It's pretty interesting that you should experience once since you can't find it elsewhere. Avoid the holiday season or you will pay the price! You have been warned!PS: some of the animals are hard to see in the dark, you can't even be sure they are inside. But overall most can be seen at good distance."
,,Not enough time.,5.0,,"We missed seeing NS 4 years ago so wanted to make sure we went this time. Booked through our hotel but paid the tour operator when we arrived at the 2nd bus to transport us there. It took over an hr to get there, so much traffic around 7pm.
It left us only 2 hrs to do the tram ride and explore by ourselves and get something to eat. We felt a bit rushed. We were picked up at the hotel at 6.15 and after 2 buses and waiting in between we arrived at NS at 8pm and the bus picked us up at 10.00.
The commentary from the tour bus guide was excellent and the park itself was very well done."
,,Visit to Night Safari in Singapore,1.0,,The visit to the night safari was not good. Long queues to get into the tram. There were very few animals. It was not even a joy ride.
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,We visited the Singapore night safari in late December 2018 and we should’ve saved our money.Early sessions at 7pm booked outWent to the 8 pm- was crazy busy- couldn’t go into shows or take the buses due to very long waiting times. Left at 11pm and had to wait for over 1.5 hours for a taxi- buses had finished- transportation poorly organised by Singapore zoo or poorly advertised- before you go check to see if it’s a busy period- if it is- save your money and see something else
,,Loved it!,4.0,,"New experience to us all ,The kids loved it so much.well organized and very clean.We book our tickets online and this saved us time."
,,Way too crowded,1.0,,"My experience was really terrible as I pre-booked online and when we arrived 20 mins before our booked time the whole Night Safari was so crowded... We had to wait several hours to get into the tram.And while waiting they played Christmas songs in endless loop - no mercy.Please don't let more people in than fit in, otherwise this nice attraction will loose it's magic very quickly!"
,,"Great Experience, Fantastic Team",4.0,,"The whole experience at the Night Safari is great. The only gripe I have is over people who can't listen to the request to not use flash photography. I feel so sorry for the guides as they have to keep requesting no flash over and over again, and can't do anything about it. Next time, confiscate the phones/cameras!"
,,"Terrible queue for tram, designated hours enter",1.0,,"Entrance took 1hrs to get in, another hr to get onto the tram. Limited path to explore by the time kiddos done with tram ride. Super packed to get into the show, twice!"
,,Peak Crowds Not Handled Well,2.0,,"I’ve always recommended the Night Safari to visitors because my previous trips have been good but that was many years ago. This recent trip was on a weekend (because the shows are only on weekends) and during the December peak holiday period. The creature of the night show was full and entry closed 45 minutes before show times for the 2 consecutive shows I tried to get into. The queues for the tram rides were half an hour long wait. I only did the walking trail (not complete because I had to track back to try to get into the show) and then went home. I managed to watched the fire performance because I got there early for dinner. But then again you don’t have to pay for entry to watch the fire performance since it’s outside the entrance. Why doesn’t the management include weekday performances on peak periods to thin out the crowds? Does it make sense to queue more 1 hour for a 25 min show? The whole experience felt like a mad jostle with crowds. Very disappointing. I probably won’t recommend visitors to visit the Night Safari again for fear of them having as bad an experience as I had. The queues for our timed entries started one hour before entry time. Is this logical? The park has 7.15pm, 8.15pm, 9.15pm & 10.15pm entry times. You spend 30min-1hr in the queue for entry. Then you spend 1 hour in the queue for the creature of the night shows which are at 7.15pm, 8.30pm, 9.30pm & 10.30pm. The park closes at 12 midnight. So if you are lucky enough to secure the 7.15pm tickets you need to do a mad dash to get into the first creatures of the night show before it fills up. If you are unlucky and can’t get to enter you have to dash back to join the queue of people taking the tram. If you heed the park rangers advice to take the walking trail first you will end up even worse because the 2nd entry would have entered by then and you would be stuck either again at the Long tram queue or waiting for the 8.30pm or worse 9.30pm show. Good luck."
,,Super fun!,5.0,,We went after a thunderstorm. The Night Safari was cool and the animals active. The Laughing Hyenas were the best. The show host was also superb.
,,Good attraction but simply too crowded,2.0,,This is a unique attraction with some very well arranged and thought out ways of presenting the animals but still maintaining a comfortable habitat for them. The downside is that most of the time it is simply too crowded to be enjoyable.

,,Overrated.,1.0,,"I wouldn’t spend an evening waiting in long lines, cramped to see a staged tour of a zoo. Not even close to being a safari. So much other stuff to see in Singapore. Especially at night. Unless u r there for a long time. Don’t waste your time."
,,Great concept has become a victim of its success,3.0,,This was my fourth night visit in the last 10 years. While the organisation and throughput of the hordes of visitors is impressive I cannot help but notice that the night safari is becoming more and more of a commercial money spinner for the Singapore Zoo. Insufficient consideration is given to saturation levels. The train now hardly stops at the various enclosures. If an animal can’t be seen at first glimpse the carriage doesn’t even bother to stop due to the pressure from the trains behind.I highly recommend you walk the circuits after the train ride. You’ll see more animals there!
,,Must do if Visiting Singapore,5.0,,"We had a wonderful experience with the Guided Tour Night Safari. Our guide was very friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful as were the keeprs we met when we visited several of the animal yards and displays. The highlights were when we were able to interact with several of the animals with the assistance of our guide and the keepers. Visit the Singapore zoo Night Safari website to see what you can see and o, well worth for individuals, couples and families."
,,Deception,3.0,,Dissapointed. Small enclosures. Train hardly slows down. We regret having chosen to spend one of our evenings in Singapore there.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Very good, but a few animals aren't clearly visible. The tram ride could have fans to make the journey more pleasant."
,,Highly recommended activity in Singapore,5.0,,"The night safari is fantastic, all the animals are cleverly lit so they it’s not too bright for them yet you can still see the animals quite clearly. We were told to book ahead as it would be busy but it wasn’t overcrowded at all, we took the latest slot and still had time for the tram ride and then a stroll on the trails too. The bat enclosure was a highlight as well as watching the fishing cats in action."
,,Well treated animals,5.0,,"This was a great experience and would definitely recommend. Use GRAB at to get there, this well get you a well priced taxi, normal taxis will screw you. The animals were so much more at ease and curious at night, and the zoo was all about the animals well being and lively hood."
,,So much better than just going to the zoo,5.0,,"I used to live in Singapore as a child and always used to go to the Night Safari, i went back when i was there on holiday recently. I absolutely loved it, they've not changed a whole lot and I think that's for the best. The tram ride is great, gives you a view of all the animals (if you want to make sure all of them are awake, i'd wait until about 8-8:30 to do the tram) and then i highly highly recommend walking the fishing cat trail and going to see the leopards, clouded leopard and lions (you see them on the tram but worth going back) by walking. This is a great thing to do, i think that people miss this out and just do the tram but i really think it's worth walking the trail too. LOVEEEE the night safari - and if you get a person who is doing live commentary on the tram, that's the best, they do have recorded ones but live is always better as the people who do this have so much personality and passion"
,,Singapore Night Zoo,4.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari is a brilliant and unique experience. However, take the walking trails first, and then do the tram as late as you possibly can. Otherwise the zoo is the people and the queues to get on the tram. The management of the tram loading could be improved. We were at the front of the queue (persons 3&4 at the time window opening). However, it took us an hour and a quarter to get on a tram. We saw people we recognised as way behind us sent through to station 2. Once on the tram, people to need to turn of their flash and keep QUIET! The people on the tram detracted from what was an amazing experience seeing the animals at night. Well done zoo keepers, not so well done tram loaders and fellow tourists."
,,"Night Safari, Singapore: overpriced and disappointing",1.0,,"We went to the Night Safari last night with our two daughters, aged 10 and 11 (entry time 8.15pm). It was pretty disapointing. Very overpriced ($150 for 2 adults, 2 kids), long queues, half an hour tram ride where you could see some animals for a few seconds each....and a condescending creatures of the night show. The kids were pretty tired by that time so we skipped the wallaby walk. The night safari is definitely one tourist attraction to avoid. On the plus side, always nice to see a lion. And have a photo taken with an owl."
,,Night safari was fun,4.0,,Night safari was fun. We visited in peak time and the line for the tram was way too long to wait. We walked around the zoo collecting stamps and got a free badge on the way out.
,,Night Zoo Safari well worth the travel time,5.0,,"This is an amazing experience but despite many reminders and announcements about being quiet so as to not spook the animals as the Trams meander thru the Zoo, a group of Indian tourists whose kids were a nightmare, out of control with zero discipline, made so much noise that I finally had to turn around and remind them the lions were coming up and if they did not shut up, the lions might get an additional meal! Except for some Aussies responding “here, here…go girl” they did not shut up, nor did the parents attempt to quieten then and, yes, they spoke English.
I would suggest that children be banned from this event after 8pm. If they can’t behave and shut up, they should not be allowed to ruin the experience for everyone else.
The time it takes to do the Tram ride, the Walk on the Wild Side, take in the Creatures of the Night Show and the Fire Show means you should start the experience no later than 5pm, do the Walk first. Sadly, I was with a group and all we had time for was dinner, the Tram ride and, I chose the Creatures of the Night Show which was entertaining and clearly involved much training of the animals participating and included audience participation as well. I had no time for the Fire Show.
There is a huge eating area with a buffet covering every food taste there is – too many choices perhaps! The Zoo is a quarantine area so no pets or plants permitted.
TIP: Singapore’s Zoo is actually quite a drive from downtown where most tourists stay; it is also accessed by the road which leads to Kuala Lumpur so heavy traffic is frequent with the many KL workers returning to their homes – Fridays are the worst. Allow plenty of time to get there."
,,"A unique opportunity to see animals ""in a new light""....moonlight",4.0,,"This was my daughter's favorite activity in Singapore. She loved that some of the animals were very close to the tram, and that you could see animals that may not normally be visible in the day at the zoo. Walking the Wallaby trail was the other highlight of the evening. Definitely a must do when in Singapore, especially with Kids!
We were on the 7:15 pm entry, and by the time we made it onto the tram (roughly 7:35 pm) dusk had given way to night and the viewing was perfect.
Bring bug spray and use it!
Note that the ticketing can be tricky if trying to buy on the website in advance, due to the use of a special security system (one time password) for credit card purchases. I ended up calling the WRS ticketing office and putting our tickets on hold, and paid for them when we arrived at site. I had specifically asked them to reserve the earliest entry time for us (since my daughter would not last long in the evening) and they honored the 7:15 entry time slot reservation. (entry to the park is quantity limited by time slots to avoid overcrowding in the park)"
,,Great Time with Family!,5.0,,We have been celebrating New Year at Night Safari for the past three years! We really enjoyed ushering the new year in the wildlife atmosphere here.
,,Excellent way to see Asian wildlife,5.0,,"The zoo is a half an hour from downtown, but the experience is worth the taxi ride. Four shows nightly allow for lots of people to participate in this event. Admission is controlled for each show. A short wait is required before being allowed into the outdoor auditorium. Our hostess had a great personality and kept the event moving nicely. We were introduced to several Asian animals that had been trained to do some things—like the owls doing a flyover or the blond raccoon appearing on stage. After the show, we left for the tram ride which showed other animals in a more or less natural habitat. Many of these animals are endangered, and this zoo has worked to help preserve them with breeding programs. Only the tiger was sequestered, but he was active as we went by. Excellent organization and execution of this event made it worth its price. The only difficulty was that foreigners cannot book this event online, but the website tells which performances have room."
,,A worthwhile attraction but ...,4.0,,"Singapore zoo was the first to create a night zoo experience. It was a must see attraction for many years but I think the formula is a little tired now. Don't get me wrong, it is a very slick operation and everything runs like clockwork. There are still large crowds every evening and paying for express tram ride is recommended unless you have a lot of time on your hand.
I suppose my review is based on the fact that this is my second visit and I come to realise there are limits to what you can do with animal displays in the dark. Most of the time they are just standing there not doing much while you ride past enclosures on the tram. You can do walking trails after the tram ride but it is only marginally better. There are a couple of shows but seatings are limited. So if you have never been to a zoo after dark and want to experience that then this is as painless as it gets but value for money will vary widely depending on your interests and expectations."
,,Loved it! And do the personal tour,5.0,,"we went all in for the experience. Heard about the rave reviews of the night safari. We took it a step further and did the personal adventure tour. While the price is high - the value is outstanding. We had a personal guide (Fahmi) who gave us a really up close experience with the animals. You can also avoid the lines and get to know the zoo from a much different perspective. for a family of 5 - this was expensive. But if we decided - if we are going to do it - let's do it right. No regrets. Just more great memories.

Fahmi was tops!!!

A must experience in Singapore"
,,Mr Purnell,1.0,,"Was told to go by a friend, what a disappointment seen plenty of deer’s one lion and a few pigs and couple elephants paid for two taxis at $20 each way. Not just a waste of money but a waste of time and effort getting ready."
,,Very busy but a nice easy way to see animals at night,4.0,,"After spending 8 hours walking around the zoo, getting on a tram to see the Night Zoo was a WELCOME relief. The commentary was good and the show was fun. VERY busy so you need to be prepared to stand in line a lot. I recommend doing the first entry and going straight to the show, then on the tram. We did not do any of the walking trails and don't feel like we missed out on anything."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,Night Zoo Safari - a must visit in Singapore. One of the best in the world. Indeed a unique experience to see animals come alive at night.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"We visited this venue with such high expectations but the whole experience was truly disappointing.
The length of que time was over an hour to get onto the tram ride for the 915 entry. Animals were difficult to spot and to be honest I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel. Just not worth the effort."
,,Just okay,3.0,,"The zoo is fantastic during the day but the night safari is a disappointment in comparison.

You don’t see a large number of animals although the lions and elephants are impressive at night.

Eat before you go as the food, which is pretty decent, costs a little over double what it does in town.

If you do go, a taxi will only cost you $20.00 to $25.00 and is the best option."
,,Great zoo experience,4.0,,"A must do in my opinion. Animals were so much more active than at the day zoo. We took the 915pm admission time and the queue for the tram moved through quickly. Tran tour was good although it would be better to have slightly longer stops at the clearings. The animals were quite active during our tour lucky enough. We followed the 30min tram tour with the walking trail which took just under an hour. Make sure you take water with you on the walk as it’s a bit warm.

Great fun for adults and kids."
,,A different experience,4.0,,"The Night Safari was rather interesting and I would certainly recommend it to families, particularly young families. We did enjoy the experience but for two seniors it is a long taxi ride from the marina area of Singapore. We apparently missed some signage but we did a lot of walking before we got our tickets and got to the tram. Two Senior Travelers"
,,Animals are awake,4.0,,"Our Grab driver scared us by saying all the animals are asleep and there is nothing to see at the Night Safari. We went on the 9:15 pm tram and all the animals except like 2 were awake and wondering around. We even heard a lion roar. Its a little pricey, but definitely worth it. If you're taking a Grab to the Night Safari, be prepared to take the taxi back out to the city as it is hard to find Grab to come out at that hour."
,,Great place,4.0,,"It was a great place to spend the night with kids. Ticket kiosk for online booking redemption is available and the queue is not long. The tram ride is very organized, didn't take long for our turn. We came just in time for the show at 8pm an the nocturnal animal show right after that. The tram ride across the safari is wonderful."
,,What a treat!,5.0,,"I have been lucky to visit some of the worlds best zoos, but doing the night safari took things to a whole new level! We first walked the park and got up close to many exhibits you don’t see on the tram. Then we took the last tram and were amazed at seeing all of the big feature animals active! It was our kids holiday highlight in Singapore!"
,,Very nice over all but little improvements can make it great,4.0,,It was worth going for night safari saw live animals at night moving through tram amazing atmosphere the only lop side would be there was show before we got into the tram big que for the show but honestly nothing too special about the show the lady hosting it was funny and great but over all nothing much to see having said that I’ll reccomend night safari to everyone if they can stand in a que
,,Great night but book on a tour to save lots of time,4.0,,"We booked through the mobile phone app that hotel supplied .
Coach picked us up at 6 at hotel . Good bus but long ride in very busy traffic took about 80 minutes to arrive .
Very bossy tour guide who was overpowering .
Night safari was very busy and we we’re placed on train straight away.
It’s very spooky but amazing how close you get to lions tigers and many other animals.
The noises were amazing.
After tour you can walk round certain enclosures but directions need more signs.
Journey back on coach was much quicker due to no traffic .
It’s very hot and humid so make sure you take water and dress lightly.
Well worth the package ."
,,Night Safari Visit,4.0,,"The line towards the night safari trolley (ride) was well organised and managed well. Staff was friendly and guided visitors well. There were some people that disobeyed rules wrt to camera flash lights after being briefed not to use flash lights from the cameras. How annoying!The Safari show after the Trolley ride was not organised at all!!!!! People were rushing and cutting previously waiting visitors especially the one's with young children. People did not know personal space distance and kept bumping into other visitors. Once the door to the show was opened people ran into the out door theater. Unorganized! After being seated staff members tried to cram more people into the theater like sardines in a can (this part of the Safari Show, was not a good experience).The show turned out to be interesting and good (with a good commentator, she knew her animals well) but the prior unorganized way of entering and cramming of visitors into the theater will be an experience which i do not want to encounter again."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"I am pretty sure most of the people have been in a zoo before but visiting a zoo at Night in animals' natural habitat? It was an amazing experience. The biggest problem was the queue. We needed to wait more than 2 hours to get the ticket and wait the tram to go around zoo. If you are planning to go, do not forget to buy your tickets online. Night safari is a must if you are in Singapore but the place is little bit far from city so check your options (taxi, bus) before you go there."
,,Night Safari experience 2018,4.0,,It was a great experience for the children's. Except that it was raining so we did not get to watch the show.Overall it was great!!
,,Spooky,5.0,,"Dont miss the aborginal fire show which starts at 8 pm on the entrance gate. Its awesome. For a more better experience, walk the trail which gives an awesome view of the animals at night."
,,Very long queue,1.0,,Pl avoid if you do not like long queue. You can go for walking trail. The long queue will make the whole experience worse. You can talk a bus while coming back as taxi are less.
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"Over crowded , outside Singapore, really dark, no animal variety. Very boring. Waist of money! Better visit the day zoo"
,,Just WOW!,5.0,,"I wasn’t keen to visit but my son convinced me. It’s a must see in Singapore for anyone of any age.

The cost is $47. Buy your ticket there. There are 4 entry times: 7:15, 8:15, 9:15 and 10:15. We entered at 9:15. It took under 2 hours to walk around then 40 minutes on the tram. Don’t line up for the tram when you first go in as the queues are long. We went after we walked and there was no queue.

Take a bottle of water and mosquito repellent. The tram is well worth it as you get to see animals you can’t see on the walking trail and do enter the bat cave no matter how quickly you zoom through it!"
,,Alert Alert Tourist Trap….. Not Recommended,1.0,,"I see some of the recent reviews are in line with my review. Highly disappointed and waste of our time. Where do I begin with this tour….. Family of 8 visited with 2 small children ages 4 and 7 yo.

First of all, zoo is a ways outside city limits of Singapore and no direct MRT/Metro to get there. It will take an hour or longer if traveling by MRT. One could take a direct taxi/grab there but more expensive but don't waste your time on this one.

Arrived on a Tuesday which we thought was an off day but during Holidays. There were masses and masses of people. Very crowded. We arrived and got tickets to the night safari and had dinner. Dinner was very crowded with multiple restaurants but food was ok. Expensive. From the start a tourist trap with selling of toys, stuffed animals.

Our tour/tram started at 7:45 pm but had a animal show prior with long lines of people waiting to get in. There was absolutely no crowd control from the management and people were pushing-shoving their way in for seats. I have never experienced anything like this. Felt like a mob……. finally got seated outside and the show was 30 minutes. I have to say one of the worst animal shows I've ever seen. Had a few animals come out but nothing spectacular. One of the acts they couldn't get the animal to do what they wanted. It was in my opinion a waste of time. We then got up along with more pushing and people trying to get in line for the night safari. We got in line for a 30 minute ride that had to be the most disappointing. Many of the animals were not in view. Some comments were made if this was real or a hologram such as in the Tiger exhibit. I left the safari thinking what a waste of time and money!

Please take my advice and avoid this tourist trap, not worth your time!!"
,,Doesn't live up to hype,3.0,,Went to night safari with high expectations. Most of the animals are difficult to see and take my tip go during the day it will be more relaxed and you will see more.
,,"Disorganized, poor management",1.0,,"We were booked for the 9.15 show, waited in the queue for one and a half hour for our tram ride, missed out on the show and walking tour. They had oversold the tickets and so because of the large crowds you could only do one of the three activities! Not worth the money you pay for it! Tune into discovery channel for cheaper and better option!"
,,Night safari,1.0,,"Waste of time and money would notvrecomend. We pre purchassed tickets from a visitor centre and was told we could collect tickets from the zoo. We got there in what we thought was plenty of time for the 8.15 tour, only to find we had to Queue for 40 mins buy which time the 8.15 & 9.15 shows were sold out so we had to go for the 10.15.
Then we had to hang around and QUEUE again from 8.45-10.15.
We EVENTUALY got on a tram at 10.35, didnt get the
Chance to see the show or wlalk around. Tram ride lasted 35 mins didnt see very much.
When we left to go back to our hotel it was a NIGHTMARE QUEUE again for taxi but there was not enough so had to get a bus the the nearest MRT. Then find a taxi got back to our hotel at 1.15 in the morning.
Cant express our DISAPOINTMENT ENOUGH."
,,Something different,4.0,,"I was visiting Singapore in November this year and it had been recommended to me to go on the night safari at the zoo. I was able to book this through the hotel concierge which was great as it meant I was picked up and dropped off again before & after.

On arrival at the zoo, the entrance can have really long queues but as I was booked with a tour group we got straight through ( I would definatley recommend booking prior to the visit). The safari takes you on a tour round the zoo at night which is exciting as you have no idea what you are going to see lurking in the dark! However, the reason I am not giving it the 5 stars is that it can be hit or miss whether the animals will make an appearance. Various factors such as noise and light can affect what you may or may not see so so one group may have a better experience than the next.

Once the guided tour is complete there is plenty of time for you to go and explore on your own by foot. The routes are well signposted and there are plenty of staff about so you won't get lost and is completely safe.

There are also various shows on offer such as a fire show and a show where some of the animals are introduced to the audience. There can be some audience participation too which adds to the fun. Overall, worth a visit and a great experience and a fun night out for all ages."
,,Dark Night Wildlife,4.0,,"Night Safari had various varieties of animals and showcased their habitat while people watch them from the tram. The tram ride is a must as it really covers most of the park and gives so much information about them. The best animals were the Malayan Tiger, Kangaroos and the Asian Elephants. After the Tram do visit the Creatures of the night show as it has excellent anchors and the animals are so much fun to watch. Do volunteer in that show to get a chance to feed a black fox or touch a python and hold it. After that you can even walk to the trails. The two best trails are Wallaby and Fishing Cat trail. Do spend a night there and get amazed. That's why I give it FOUR STARS."
,,We commend the admin at the night safari show,5.0,,"Thanks to the admin at the night safari at the Singapore zoo, they quickly responded to our complaint re invalid vouchers especially Emmey who looked after us until we were refunded and got to see the night safari on time."
,,Super busy!!,3.0,,"Booked for 8.15pm tour and not sure if we got it. Was extremely busy (which we were not expecting) with very long queues. I don't recommend going in school holidays. Walking tracks were good but dissapointing to see children banging on glass and people using flash photography (which is not allowed) and lights on phones to try attract and wake up animals. Would benefit from having staff and every enclosure to ensure this doesn't happens as animals do not deserve this. Recommend you do both tram and walking tracks as you see different animals on these. We booked tour online and were not sure if we got appropriate tram as there was tram with multiple carriages and a smaller tram, this was not clearly marked so we ended up on big tram. Also to be noted that it is about a 40 minute taxi ride from city. Queues for taxi were long when leaving, had to wait approximately 30 minutes. Would recommend this tour possibly outside of holiday period to avoid crowds."
,,Not much to see!!,1.0,,An amusement park like facility with thousands of people very disorganized !Not recommended at all overpriced !
,,Family visit to singapore,5.0,,"Did this night safari - and was amazing , great atmosphere and lots for the kids to see and do ! Very clean - good for older couples and the staff at the night tour - mainly Sarah was fantastic in helping us out ! Clean toilets , food well priced and cool at night . Note we used grab to get there and back as is a 35 min drive from town"
,,"Great night safari, terrible organisation",3.0,,"I really can't fault the night safari your tour. It was fantastic to see all the animals and so close up. The show was really well put together as well, beware if you don't like snakes, they do bring one onstage.

The only issue was the organisation or, complete lack if it. There were not enough staff to help explain the order. The times were all messed up when calling for the pre-booked tickets there is no e plantation that you need to collect from a reception desk. The website is truly awful, one section says you can do the trails before the booked tour, we arrived early to find this is not the case and you have to wait until after. The waiting area is absolute chaos!

Aprt from this, if they get the website and organisation sorted it will be brilliant"
,,Magical and memorable!,5.0,,"We loved our visit to the Night Safari! We arrived at 8:15 and queued for the tram (cars that take you around), which didn’t take too long even though it looked very busy. In the queue, the restaurants and cafes looked really good, but we never got a chance to go to them. We didn’t leave the park until 11:45 and we were busy throughout! So if you fancy some food, I recommend getting there a little earlier and eat before you start.

Once on the tram safari, we listened to information about the animals and got to see a huge array of animals. They were all where you could see them and relatively well-lit but not enough for clear photos, so put your camera phones away and just enjoy the eerie but amazing feeling of being in the wild amongst these animals! Our favourite moment was seeing the wolves howling stood upon a rock! It was like a scene from The Jungle Book!

After the tram part of the tour, you’ll be able to take yourself along the walking route, which is split into 4 parts, but very simple to follow. This part was really nice as you could go at your own pace and read all the information labels that tell you about the animals and their habitats. As it got later, at times we felt alone in the jungle - a really memorable feeling. Staff were positioned mainly to guide you in the right directions, but whenever we spoke to any of them, they knew lots of details about their animals.

We left the park at midnight absolutely buzzing! We arrived in Singapore that morning, travelling from Thailand, so to still feel so awake says a lot about how exciting the Night Safari was. It is a must see!"
,,"Honestly, average",3.0,,"It could be smart if the Night Safari offered options for adults only after 10pm. Each and every exhibit was ruined by a screaming child. If they must, any children alllowed in should not be able to talk or wear light up shoes. No flash photography... logic would dictate no flashing shoes. For the animals"
,,Not bad,4.0,,The animal was in a close distance m. Elephant was a bit pity as it was making some crying noise i guess.. another elephant was so huge. Some harmless animals was standing nearby the vehicle we traveled. It was fun overall..
,,Amazing experience thanks to Ng Jia Wei Leslie and Sumailah,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore then a visit to the night Safari is a MUST. What makes it special is not just the arrangement but the people who are managing it. A special shout to Leslie and sumailah (apologies if I have spelt it wrong).

You made our evening so special, especially for our 6 year old that we will always cherish it for life and we promise that whenever we come to Singapore we will come to the night Safari. Thank you for creating beautiful memories for life for us."
,,Overcrowded expensive tourist trap - avoid,2.0,,Went to the Night Safari with my kids with high expectations; what I encountered was a huge crowd and very long queues. Even though I bought my ticket in advance and it was at a specific time slot I had to stand in queue for 40 minutes to get on a tram. The tram ride takes you through a trail with several animal exhibits on either side; several animals were not visible. Given the ticket prices the whole experience seemed like a giant rip off.
,,On Your Own or Tour Group is a Toss Up?,4.0,,"Night Safari is a nice experience for those who have not experienced a wild African safari. The downside is people ... who can’t figure out how to turn off their flash and phone brightness. We took a tour; downside is waiting being heard like cats, but the benefit was completely skipping the hour long entry line with priority pass! Either way, it takes far more time than one might expect, like 4+ hours."
,,Terrific & Unique experience,5.0,,"Truly surreal and unique experience. One of the more popular attractions and can get quite crowded. So plan to reach early before 7 pm for the first slot which starts at 7:15 pm . On entering , we found a huge line for the tram ride & so we quickly made our way to the Creatures of the Night show which was good , liked the interactive nature of the show :)
After that we went for the tram ride and then the 4 trails . It can get quite scary walking the trails at night but that i think is the USP of this place ; to get to see nocturnal animals up close ."
,,Spectacular! Must see!,5.0,,"Out Visit to Night Safari Singapore was filled with breathtaking exhibits that really did make you smile, definitely going to this place again!"
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Was very busy, lots of people and waiting in lines but was well worth it. We did the tram ride first then we went walking through the zoo (this was the best part). We got to see loads of different animals and loved it. We took a taxi from town was $20 Singapore dollars and the line for taxi after moved quickly."
,,A must d in Singapore if somewhat $$$,4.0,,"If your looking for a unique experience with animals at night dont miss this one. You need to pick your times as it does get very very busy on occasions, in fact I cant remember a time it was quiet !. Generally earlier the better, aim for the first show then explore the rest of the facility including the Tram ride with live encounter of animals fairly close in a natural forest environment. Food and Drinks available for a price !. Bus, Taxi no problem."
,,Very different (in a good way) zoo experience,5.0,,"Close ups to many different animals, laid out in a way that makes one feel in communion with the wildlife. After the tram ride make sure to walk the different paths, as many animals are only visible by walking. It is Singapore, so be prepared for a muggy evening, but one you won't forget."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"After hearing rave reviews of this attraction, I thought it was a must do thing during our time in Singapore. We unfortunately wasted our last night here and wish we hadn’t bothered.

Firstly, please don’t waste you time going to the “Creatures of the Night” show, it really isn’t worth it. You catch a glimpse of a few animals that are so far away you can barely see them. The owl didn’t want to fly and a couple of the animals wouldn’t come out at all.

The queue for the tram is the most disorganised chaos I’ve ever experienced. Super busy and people that work there just shouting at everyone to try and herd them into the right place. When we finally got going the tour was very disappointing, as you can’t see a lot because the light is so dim.

All in all, I wish I hadn’t bothered. Lovely idea but doesn’t really work in practice. We had been to the “day” zoo before thisand if you want to see actual animals I’d suggest you do that rather than the night safari."
,,Don’t go,1.0,,"1. Lighting is too dark to see any of the animals
2. Long line for the tram ride
3. Most of the animals are asleep during the night
4. It is not a safari! Its a zoo that is in the dark with very dim lighting.

Please visit the zoo during the day!"
,,Night Zoo in the rainy evening,4.0,,"Visited the night zoo with children on a rainy evening. It is a rainy season and so we are prepared with umbrella for the walk in the dark. Mostly led lights everywhere and along the path. It can be quite scary as certain stretch is without anyone in sight. There are some activities that the children and adults to ""jump"" on the prepared platform to make the animated animals to jump on the screen. A show about the animals and a few others. At the end of the adventure there is photo taking session by oneself at the booth, using the bracelet that was given at the beginning of the tour, which one can download after getting home. Overall it is a good one time experience."
,,Better to visit the zoo in morning,3.0,,"Personally, found Night Safari to be a hype created. Most of the animals are hardly there to be seen, and the ones which are, it's too dark to notice nicely.

Carriage ride to the Safari had speakers which made of the noises and one longs for them to shut it off in order to notice real noises made by the animals which are visible.

It's too dark to notice almost anything. Thus, plan a visit in the morning for the zoo and actually see all the animals instead of just hearing that there are USUALLY TIGERS AND BEARS AROUND HERE, which one ""MIGHT"" come across (but never do).

The creatures of the night show was good and the anchors were funny. Well presented show, but that's all there is to night Safari.

Repeating my suggestion, visit the zoo in morning instead.

Thanks

Aneja"
,,It wasn't upto the expectations,3.0,,"Night Safari is indeed a unique experience if you are interested in the spotting the nocturnal animals in a zoo. It's definitely enjoyable for some but wasn't something that was worth the effort. Since Singapore Zoo is located a bit far out, it takes quite a while to reach here through public transport. The safari lasts between 30-45 minutes followed by an animal show. Though it definitely seems that the animals are very well taken care of, I was slightly skeptic of spotting them all in a particular zone which was light up and wasn't very happy with them having to sense the presence of humans in trains and constant voices playing through the speakers. I am not well aware of how the animals are looked after in this zoo, but it wasn't something that I enjoyed well. It seemed a bit overrated though surely a fun experience for kids and someone who hasn't seen much of similar stuff. So even if you miss it, you haven't missed much."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"We were given as a present, if we had paid for it I would have been disappointed, too dark to see most of the animals and most of them were deers. Photos were not allowed, lasted about 40 minutes"
,,Intresting concept,5.0,,"Allowing viewing of animals in night provides different experience. However, some more animals can be included. "
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,Best thing is that they have kept all the animals in very good condition. Kids have enjoyed a lot. Show was also very informative.
,,Great place to closely encounter the nature,5.0,,"We have been to Singapore zoo previously and found that the Night Safari was much more exciting. We took the hiking trails to discover the night zoo before going back to queue for the tram (which was less than crowded at 9.30pm and afterwards) to closely encounter the nocturnal creatures. Such a great place to enjoy, and more importantly, to learn more about the nature!"
,,Christmas Safari,4.0,,"Visited the safari on Friday, just few days before the Christmas and it was quite crowded as there were few tour groups.

It was great experience to witnessed the Malayan Tiger feeding.

Suggest to arrive at 6.30pm as to purchase the ticket, and proceed to the entrance as there is a fire show at 6.45pm.

Following you may go to amphitheater animal show and after that walk around the park.

Last but not least, go for a tram ride as certain animals like giant elephant not able to view by crossing the walking trail."
,,Cute and amazing,5.0,,"I can't believe that the night safari saved so many beautiful animals and
I got to see them. I had a great time on the tram ride and the Creatures of the Night show. We missed most of the fire show but we saw a little bit of the end and it was really cool. Highly recommended for animal lovers and children."
,,Night and River Safari,5.0,,"We didn't have time for the zoo but did the River and Night Safari. The River included many different tanks with under water views of many different fish including Manatees. There was also pandas, one of which put on quite a show. The price included a boat ride but the only thing we saw were the giraffes at the zoo. The night safari was also great. You had a choice of riding the tram or walking. We did the tram but I think walking would have given a much better and longer view of the animals.There were many animals including, lions, tigers, rhinos, hippos, deer, oxen and many others. Both were very enjoyable and were included in our hop on hop off ticket. Enjoy"
,,Charming and thrilling place,5.0,,"This is another must see place in Singapore, the safari starts with a bus ride around the park where you see the animals being active at night.
The place also offers a nice animals show that, beside being informative, is very funny and nice.
The park opens at 7:00pm and you should be prepared for a long queue at the outset to ride the bus. Shows are played at 8:30pm, 9:30pm and 10:30pm (I think)."
,,Fair experience,3.0,,"Experience was shorter than I expected- half hour on train.
Understandably you can’t take photos of the animals.
To take a taxi from the city it will cost $35 Australian dollars plus you need to return. Probably wouldn’t do it again if I had researched it a bit more before hand.
Take the aero guard."
,,night zoo,5.0,,went for the night zoo visit and the experience was amazing! it was nice to the see the nocturnal animals being active and the feel of the zoo at night had somewhat of a magical feel to it. loved it and would visit again
,,Good experience for the kids,5.0,,The torrential rain could have ruined everything but thankfully cleared and cooled things down before the visit. Huge crowds but you can avoid by going for a walk through the many trails first.
,,A place to spend a night out,4.0,,"We had a last minute trip to Night Safari, just because we did not plan any night activities yet on the day. It was a good experience seeing how close we are to the animals and even though some are far away (maybe cause they are wild), we were also mesmerized. However, some of the animals were not there and those are the ones that we wanna see so bad. Overall, we enjoyed our trip there and surely want to visit other parks too."
,,Visit to NIght Safari,5.0,,"The visit was pleasant. Purchase of tickets was a breeze as it can be easily done online. One just have to download the entry pass to your mobile and show them to the entrance staff and it is done. Creatures of the night show was entertaining as well. However, I felt that the queue to the show could be better managed as i was initially the second family in the queue when suddenly a group of tour appear in front of me claiming they are of the same group ahead and we were being automatically pushed back. Tram ride was smooth, with stops along the way to let visitors view the animals accompanied with detailed explanation by the staff. It's a pity that some visitors still use flash lights to take their pictures despite the several warnings by the staff. Nevertheless, kudos to the staff for constantly reminding the visitors to refrain from doing so. The shops and restaurants located at the exit were also strategically positioned. When one's tour has ended, we can just chill at the bar or restaurants and subsequently take a stroll to enjoy the exhibit for sale at the shops. Taxi are plenty at the waiting/drop off point, hence transportation is something not to worry on. Overall, Excellent!"
,,Eating places,3.0,,"We have visited night safari about 4 times with my family, attractions, set up and cleanliness is very good. The only draw back is not much of eating places (Resturents). For the past 4 years it has been the same food variety I see there. Specially when u come with small children it’s better if you could have much variety of food. Eg. Burgers,hot dogs, western meals, Asian etc."
,,Surprisingly thrilling,5.0,,"We weren’t overly confident on the value of this excursion - looking for animals at night - but what a thrill it was. From our jeep, we were navigated through the zoo in virtual darkness and silence. The first few exhibits showed no sign of life and we tittered to ourselves that we’d wasted our money, but then after that, in dim lights were were able to see so many wonderful creatures. They felt tantalisingly close. Not having visited in the day, I am unsure how this is achieved. Maybe moats separating people from the animals? No cages or bars. It was great. Oh, apart from the tigers who were behind glass... Thoroughly recommend the Indian food outlet too. Delicious. All in all, a great experience. Just be prepared that the zoo is a bit out of the way. We used the MRT and a bus to get there and a taxi back. Maybe something to do when the jet lag has settled ?!"
,,Rainy day spoilt the Night Safari Experience,3.0,,"The day we visited, it had poured heavily and was still when our Night Safari was on. Many of the animals had taken shelter and some we could just see in fraction of minutes. Overall, had too much expectations from Night safari, the pictures that were advertised, but the weather spoilt all of that. The live shows were cancelled to."
,,Fabulous place. Must do!,5.0,,"It's a fabulous place. It's a must visit,Beautiful done up. The walking trail is just as good. I would totally recommend doing both the walking trail and the tram."
,,"Limited animals, light is too dark.",1.0,,The lighting is way too dark. Can't even see the animals clearly. Singapore night Safari should go and learn from chiangmai night safari... lighting a clearer and visible to look at animals.The other problem is there just Not many animals available. There is not even a Giraffe or zebra in this night Safari. All I kept seeing is deer and wild boar.
,,Wonderful opportunity,4.0,,"We could have used a bit more time here. We had no time for the show(s) at all. We took the tram ride first, then did the walks. We were only in Singapore for a few days and were using the Night Safari bus ride from the Hop on Bus. Using other transportation would have given us a longer visit. I would suggest checking out the show time(s) ahead of time and perhaps going there before the tram ride. Upon arrival at the opening time, the tram lines were long. Later there was no line. Also, if you buy your tkt online ahead of time, you do not need to walk across the park entry area -- we lost about 8 minutes just walking to the tkt booth that we did not need to. The Night Safari itself is a great idea -- how special to see these animals in their natural environment."
,,a bit disappoiting,3.0,,lots of very good reviews on this and it seems that it was a must see/do in Singapore. I have marked this as average as there are 2 parts in the visit: 1 on a (Diesel) train which last around 45min.. this is quite bad.. one cant see the animals and the train does make lots of noise and fumes!!! (felt sorry for the animals and for my asthmatic wife too) - 2 the walking part where one does the zoo at night by oneself.. this part is very good as without noise one can see much more... price overall is ok but I will go back to the zoo for the river safari and day zoo never again for the night one
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"Any experience to the zoo needs to be considered in context. Whatever animal rescue/protection aspirations they may claim to have, this is still bored wild animals in very confined captivity 'on show' in the dark, with food being thrown at them to make sure they stay in position, in view of passing buses of tourists. I felt deeply sad for them, uncomfortable with my choice to have attended, unconvinced that these were animals 'in need of rescue' versus commodities to keep the business going, and I think morally these institutions should come to an end."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Visiting the Night Safari was an amazing experience and highly recommended. It is a totally different experience seeing the animals at night. You are taken on the safari through parts of the view where you can see the animals up close. After the safari you can then wandering around the zoo looking at the various animals. Remember the last bus back to the MRT is at 10:40pm!!!!! if you miss it you will have to get another bus or taxi!!!
,,Fun night,4.0,,"The staffs were friendly, paths are easy to walk as it was well lit. Some enclosures don’t have visible animals though"
,,One of my favourites,5.0,,"A must do in Singapore. recommend going as soon as the night safari opens, as you'll need a couple of hours. Also be mindful if you are catching the train the last one departs at 10.40pm. Do not miss this or you will need to get either a bus or a taxi home. As for the safari itself. it was amazing getting up close to the animals in a natural environment. Walking the trails afterward was well worth it too. There are plenty of eating options at the zoo so don't worry about eating first. Its a completely different experience to the day time one."
,,Great experience with animal’s comfort a priority.,5.0,,"Definitely worth the visit, the night safari showed a unique perspective on quite a few of the animals rarely seen so up close in any ordinary zoo. The open air enclosures in particular were note worthy for just how close the animals wandered towards you and the tram. This attraction seems very dependent on the attitude of the creatures per the night you visit. So keep expectations in check. And despite numerous warnings about flash photography guests still took flash photos of the critters potentially sending them into a panic.
Whilst it is no fault of the park it certainly detracted overall from the experience. Cameras might need to be removed from guests altogether if they cannot control themselves.

The focus on conservation and respecting species habitats, especially those at risk, was of particular note and I am greatly thankful we were able to see the animals on the safari and thank the staff for the experience."
,,Outstanding way to See these Nocturnal Creatures,5.0,,With mixed reviews on trip advisor I wasn’t sure what to expect with this attraction and I would have to say I wasn’t disappointed. We had an early dinner in Singapore and headed out to the night safari in a taxi. We chose the 8.15pm tram to avoid the young families and did the four walking trails ahead of the tram ride. Going mid week and a bit later made for almost no queues and while there were a few tired young ones generally everyone was enjoying the experience. We saw lots of wildlife really quite close to either the walking trail or the train and the night show was well worth the fifteen minute wait. I can see why this might be a bit much for a young family in the heat but I can’t recommend this attraction enough.
,,Forest ride experience,4.0,,"Tram ride with live encounter of animals to close experience ture forest atmosphere, one of the costly ride compare to zoo and river safari, must see place in Singapore don't miss it"
,,The trails were excellent but the tram was just Ok,4.0,,"Overall the night Safari at singapore zoo was a good experience. I found the tram ride quite disappointing most of the more exciting animals were just on one side of the tram so if you picked the wrong side you didn't get to see as much and even on the 2nd time slot the tram was extremely busy.

The trails however were a breath of fresh air you got away from the crowds and you could go round most of animals at your own pace so you got to see a lot more and get some ok photos as well."
,,Rip off!,2.0,,The lower review was mainly for twilight encounters...its super rip off...we paid so much for just light shows which were not even impressive!!!
,,go to the zoo where you can pace yourself,2.0,,This trip was nearly $50 CAD while the zoo was $33 CAD. The tram went quickly and the lighting was inadequate to see the animals well. The narration on the tram was gimmicky and not helpful. The whole experience felt overly manufactured and not a strong learning experience. I wish I had gone to the zoo where I could pace myself and watch animals longer when I chose.
,,Very pleasant experience,5.0,,"Staff was very helpful, animals were very impressive in natural environment. Tram ride was well worth lining up for."
,,world's first nocturnal zoo,5.0,,Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore when we visited. Great place & highly recommended.
,,Nothing like this,5.0,,"This is a must do. Drink coffee if you must, but when you see the first animals, your body can no longer fall asleep. Even though we left when the zoo staff sent us away, we easily found a taxi and got to our hotel safely. I gave up trying to take pictures and just enjoyed seeing the animals in their natural habitat.

There are tons of animals, and after the tram ride you can walk really up close to all the animals. We saw the most amazing things. This truly was an awesome activity and I would totally for everyone visiting Singapore."
,,The Night Zoo,4.0,,We went on guided tour from the Marina Mandarin Hotel to the Zoo. This took about 30 mins. The Zoo was quite an experience to see some of the nocturnal animalsas opposed to the daylight viewing. To get the best experience it is best to see both
,,Night safari worth while,4.0,,"The night safari at the zoo is something to concider. Not breathtaking, but you get to see several rare and impressive animals from the tram ride. Safe and secure. Friendly staff. We had the dinner combination. Buffet dinner was just OK, but you don’t expect gourmet at a place like this."
,,"Not bad, try if it is new to you",4.0,,"We booked our tickets through the Concierge and did not have to wait in line. We chose not to do any walking as there is a baby in the group but just took the train. Lucky enough to be able to see all the wild animals including tigers, lions, elephants, hyenas....and more. There may be more areas that we haven't explored yet. Overall, would say this place is still worth visiting unless you have done something similar before."
,,Worth visiting but do not expect much,3.0,,"Properly guided to walk around with the lights and pathway. However, i personally find it too dark to see anything much. Take the train to save much walking. Wear comfortable shoes and tight pants to prevent bites"
,,Save your miney,1.0,,"We felt that this trip was somewhat miss-represented.
The pitch was all about animals roaming free through the jungle and getting up close to them in their natural habitat....
It was just like going to a zoo with the lights off!
It’s a commendable venture to raise money for protected animals but it has turned into a tourist trap, coach after coach put into trams to drive around for 40 minutes looking at the few animals you can actually see....then if course dropped off at the obligatory gift shop to view the photo of you on the tram!
Save your money and just go to the zoo during the day."
,,It was ok,3.0,,We found the animal show the best part not the actual safari. The safari doesn’t stop so you can have a good look at animals. The range of animals is also quite limited. Expect long ques and waits of 20mins plus to get into everything. It’s also quite a long taxi ride out of the city so a taxi there and back costs more than the actual attraction. It wasn’t awesome but it wasn’t bad just kind of ok.
,,Good Experience,4.0,,"Staff were helpful and attentive to our needs, especially when we have an elder person with us. Kudos!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Creatures of the night show is quite interesting.Walked through the walking trails before hopping on the free tram, but not much to see.All in all, still worth the visit if never been there before."
,,Excursion,4.0,,"Night safari is operated by Singapore zoo, on the simple premise that it is a good way to see nocturnal animals.
We went with a tour operator that picked us up from a nearby hotel but not ours. They did the now tedious thing of minibuses picking up from separate locations and feeding in to coach.
Night safari operates to midnight but we had to be back on bus for ten. The shuttle takes you round the main animals, but it is all pot luck if you see anything."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,It was not that interesting as what was posted on the comments and places to visit in Singapore. We was expecting better.
,,It’s a must,5.0,,If you visit Singapore then a visit to the night safari is a must! You get to see the animals (more than you do at a daytime zoo) and they are so close too.
,,Safari,5.0,,"Very interesting and informative! Well organized but long lineups for the tram. The line does move very quickly, however. Great place to bring the family"
,,don't go there,1.0,,Litlle to see. A lot of big words about saving nature. They donate 50 cents per visitor. May be fun with small children and don't listen to the speaker.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"This time was my 10th visit to night safari. Always here is very nice place. I could not took English tram from middle station this time, it is just negative point."
,,Excellent and unique experience,5.0,,This was a great way to view the Singapore zoo. The night visit includes a night show of nocturnal animals and also a safari like guided drive through the zoo. It was unlike anything I had experienced at other zoos and was incredibly well organised!
,,An unexpected night at the zoo,5.0,,"What turn out to be a routine walk around the park, turned out to be the BEST trip by far during this visit. My family and I was very fortunate to have met Gladys on the Leopard Trail. We learn a lot trough our conversation with her and i must commend her knowledge and patience."
,,Great experience - but needs some planning,5.0,,"There are very mixed reviews for this attraction. This is due to the many people joining and the very short time you have for everything. If you have small children you might have to come at the earliest timeslot - in that case I would urge you to (a) bring water & food and (b) skip the shows at the beginning and go directly for the train (or the walk if your kinds can handle the distances). The shows can be watched afterwards as well when there are less people.
If you have the option to go at the last possible timeslot (which is what we did) it is not that crowded anymore. We went for the fire show (for like 2 minutes), the animal show (which was very well done and interesting) and then we went for the full hike through the park which gives you much more time to see the animals. After that was finished we went for another round through the park with the train (which was already completely empty except for 3 more people in another wagon).
TLDR: Make sure you know what you're getting into - then it is a great experience."
,,Night Safari visit,3.0,,"1. Missing the ""Fire Show"" that you previously had. That show gave very exciting introduction to the Night Safari.2. The Animal Show was simply too short. If I can recall, the show was very similar to the one I saw some 10 years ago except the previous one was much longer."
,,Night safari experience,5.0,,The night safari was great! It was my first experience with a 'zoo' type setting where I actually saw almost all of the animals.
,,Poor,1.0,,"What a disappointment! Went with two adults and three young kids. Paid nearly $200 for a 40 minute ride on a train but could barely see the few animals in the dark. The food was extortionately priced.
There was also another $80 to get out there and back."
,,Awesome after dark must do,5.0,,Worth everything. The tour is absolutely wonderful and the wildlife show one of the most funny and best once’s I have ever seen. I loved how close I could get to the animals and how relaxed they looked
,,Great!!!,4.0,,"other than the tram ride, there’s lots of walking which i only manage to walk half of it because it was all ups and downs and it was really tiring !!"
,,Unique Experience......A Must See,5.0,,"For those who have visited a zoo during the day and were unable to really see the animals, especially when it is hot and they, naturally, are sitting in the shade, this experience provides the unique opportunity to see the animals eating, playing, and active at night. Also, since many animals are nocturnal, after dark is the only time to see them.This is a very nice zoo, with friendly, helpful staff, and an impressive selection of wildlife. I recommend both the tram ride and also walking the trails, to fully enjoy the experience."
,,Wonderfull evening event,4.0,,Night safari was wonderful. Loved every moment. Plenty of restaurants with many variety of food. Highly recommended
,,Night Safari with RMG Tours,5.0,,"One of the highlights of our Singapore holiday. RMG Tours picked us up right on time from our hotel and the tour commenced, as always, at Gardens by the Bay. We had buckets of time to spend at the night zoo (which is completely separate to the Singapore Zoo). The zoo is actually a wildlife reserve with the animals free to roam in expansive enclosures.

First we did the tram ride (included in tour cost). My first impression was that there were so many active animals to see. Not just the odd one or two but whole groups (hard to pick the correct collective noun to use here!!) of animals. Easy to see and quite close and the variety of fauna was quite diverse. After the tram ride there is a maze of walks to take which covers a lot of territory. The reserve is quite big and the maze of walks are split into four sections which are all connected: Fishing Cat Trail, Leopard Trail, East Lodge Trail and Wallaby Trail. Easy walking and we went at a leisurely pace and still finished all trails with half an hour to spare. Thoroughly recommend that you do the full four walks. We started with the Fishing Cat Trail.

The Night Safari is NOT to be missed and I congratulate RMG Tours for making it an easy and leisurely experience. The Tour guide explained in detail all we needed to know on the tour bus on the way to the safari and then we were left completely to our own devices to make 'choices' about what we wanted to do and how we wanted to plan our time. Our choice was to do the full walks and therefore skip the fire show and creatures of the night show. In fact our tour guide told us that he thought the creatures of the night show was a waste of time!! VERY happy with our choice!!"
,,London Visitor,5.0,,An excellent place to visit. Great commentary. Would highly recommend it. Easy to get to. Took train then the very cheap shuttle.
,,Awesome time in Singapore,5.0,,My bro and I had a blast walking through the park and seeing these beautiful beasts. There was an eerie feeling to seeing the big cats in the mist since it had been raining a lot that day.
,,A date with the animals!,4.0,,"The Night Safari is a different experience from a day trip to the zoo and its popularity was evident from the throngs of tourists there, only second to the Universal Studios.
Buy your tickets beforehand to avoid queues, although there are many more queues to encounter in the Night safari. There is a queue at the entrance but you can see the fire show while you wait and do not rush, as you will not be permitted to enter before your stipulated time. After the entry, you again queue up for the tram.
The tram takes you around the park, with commentary on all the animals - we did see quite a few animals but since the tram did not stop and it was dark, we could hardly get good pictures. Don't bother clicking pictures of animals while you are on the tram. After you disembark, do witness the creatures of the night show - which is presented beautifully.
We went walking along the trails after the show, and managed to see quite a few more animals up close. The trails should not be missed even if you are tired for they give you the actual feel of being on a night safari.
Be sure to carry water and mosquito repellant. Do not talk aloud or the animals shy away."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"We arrived just after the zoo opened for the evening and the queue for tickets was very long, we then had to requeue for the actual train, which took ages. The actual trip was very pleasant and the commentary in english was informative. It was very expensive, but if you like animals then it was a lovely evening out."
,,fantastic,5.0,,"Really special tour, watch the show first with the little night animals and a huge snake and then take the safari train around to see all the animals, as it is at night you cant reallly take photos as it is difficult to see the animals on camera, so just sit back and enjoy the tour"
,,Felt like Jurassic park,5.0,,We decided to take a tour to the night safari at the zoo. Personally I wouldn’t want to walk around but others did. We enjoyed the trolley ride around the zoo and seeing the animals up close at night was a Great experience.
,,Special tour in Night Safari,5.0,,"Very special experience for the tour - Night Safari in the night and you can see lot of animal's activities in te nigt, quite interesting and impressed!"
,,Good attraction to visit,4.0,,"It just rained when we got there so going around was a little bit challenging. Good thing that there’s a tram tour, it will already take you around the main attractions of the night zoo. But if you want to see the whole night zoo, walking around is recommended."
,,We went for the night safari,4.0,,We did the night safari here. It was okay. Didn’t get to see as many animals as we thought we would see.
,,Always spectacular but this time very crowded,4.0,,"ATTENTION: Hotels are selling tickets for Zoo/NightSafari/Jurong Bird Park/River Safari which are more expensive then buying directly on the Zoo's website!

Disappointing: you can see some animals only from the (free) ""train"", not on foot.
Fantastic: everything else! It's great to see nocturnal animals during their most active time."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Great experience, used the suggested public transport to get there, although it was very busy, very organised and not much waiting around. Great to see all the animals, it was a shame they didn’t provide binoculars."
,,Absolute genius!,5.0,,"Ever wanted to feel like you'd been locked in the zoo after close? Well, now you have! This night safari (which is separate to the zoo itself although located nearby) is absolutely brilliant. Start off with a brilliant tram ride of the park which has excellent commentary. You'll see loads of animals, despite the dark! Its like a scene out of Jurassic Park (only without the dinosaurs). Very cleverly designed to be rid of any fences or barriers, you will still feel completely safe admiring the lions! Take a stroll with the wallabies and give them a hug, or get up close and personal with an alligator... If you attend one of the many shows, you'll be blown away by how many visitors there are actually in the park, as the rest of the time it feels like you're the only ones there as you stroll around in the dark. It took us about three and a half hours to leisurely cover the entire park. Exhilarating - I've never done or seen anything quite like it before!"
,,Great experience!,4.0,,"Very very busy but worth a visit!!

Connects to the zoo and river safari so we did this as part of the same trip.

Saw so many animals up close and being able to walk around parts of the exhibit in your own time is a nice touch. Plenty of well lit paths too!

The evening show was ok.. but free so worth it if you time it right

Would recommend taking bite cream / insect repellent."
,,"Is no way thrill or exciting trip, is just ride at dim light on wheels",3.0,,"A group of people’s traveling for a 30 mins in battery fitted vehicle, you are allowed to take snaps without flash. It’s not to be called as a safari, is an organised tour at dim light, the animals kept at respective places / restricted area. The children’s between 5 to 15 worth to watch this trip"
,,Cool to see the animals. Buffet was good.,3.0,,"We did the option w/ the buffet dinner. It was nice to have transportation from the hotel to the location. We did not realize this meant that we were part of a tour group and had to stay with the group and eat at a table with the group.The best part of this option was being able to skip the tram lines, though. This was key because those lines looked really long. Also our guide gave us info on where to go for the fire show and the animal demonstration. It was nice to have a bus to go back to the hotel and not have to figure out transportation since it was a long drive.

The animals were all out and very interesting to look at. It was dark so hard to see some of them. The people on our trolley were being very loud so we couldn't hear the guide and it also ruined the nice ""atmosphere"" with their loud talking and laughing and constant photos. We are told no flash photography but of course many people don't listen."
,,Definitely worth it!!,5.0,,"Well this a good experience, definitely worth it. the place also has an indian restaurant. The animals you see during the safari may not be very rare but with the slow-moving tram in the darkness of the jungle makes it all very exciting. overall a must-do!! Also dont miss the creatures of the shadow show after the night safari.."
,,Enjoyable night,4.0,,It’s a wonderful and enjoyable nite. It’s fun to be on the tram going thru the forest looking at animals.
,,Waste of money,1.0,,Do not waste your time and money. Some animals not in viewing area. Some walking back and forth in a crazed state. Hippopotamus and Elephants looked underweight.
,,Best and Most Enjoyable Night as Always!!,5.0,,"I come to Singapore every year in November for an international conference and part of our trip package is a trip to the Singapore Night Safari.
This place never fails to make us happy and enjoy it as an experience like no other. Overall, I have been here 4 times and there is always something new to see and learn. The tram ride is deffinetly worth the trip as it takes you to animal sectors all over the world, as well as the fishing cat trail and leopard trail.
Night safari is very well kept, very clean as always, very family and kid friendly and one that is by far the most worth attraction within Singapore. The staff in the Night Safari are always the most helpful people you will encounter and one that love cracking jokes and educating the visitors about something new. Animals there are beautiful, well kept and have a happy home for themselves and for everyone else.
Thank you Night Safari!! Its been an experience like no other every year, and see you again next November."
,,Night Safari Review,4.0,,The guides were not very friendly and were abrupt and authoritarian in their communication. The Creatures of the night had fewer animals than when we came 3 years ago
,,Great time!,5.0,,"Informational, well organized and ran, well staffed, a great variety of animals and an overall wonderful time had by all!"
,,Tourist rip off,1.0,,I've been to REAL safaris in Africa. This is just a show of some animals (good is that the zoo sustaines some nature). The most important thing are the souvenir shops.
,,Night Safari Adventure Tour,5.0,,Two Thumbs Up! Captain Xithee is the best! Information and entertaining. A must join program which my kids love most
,,Never fails to be magical,5.0,,Night safari combines magic and education in one attraction. Despite being busy it is so well organised that queues for tram move quickly. As before elephant is star if the show for me.
,,night visit,5.0,,The overall experience was good and the kids loved it. However the Luminaire forest wasn't to my expectation. But the kids still liked it.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"This is a great experience with my guests.Especially, there are interactive games for visitors.Pls keep up the good work."
,,A night of expectations,3.0,,"Haven’t been to the night zoo for past many years since my children have grown up. Surprised to see many changes to the place; it’s much livelier with many shops opening till midnight; the staff there are all super friendly and helpful even though I can see how tired they may be.
The commentary on the tram ride was really informative but unfortunately some of the animals were too shy to come out; so didn’t get to see many of the night creatures; that is disappointing.
The night show was interesting with very cute creatures like the otters; bringing laughter and a joy to watch."
,,Great experience,5.0,,It was awesome to see all those nocturnal creatures in their natural habitats. The night show was also funny and interesting. Indian food available easily.
,,Needed more time,5.0,,"We used the mrt and shuttle bus to get to the night safari. The bus was slightly difficult to find, and very busy (don't let anyone push in front of you). We went on the walking trails, intending to take the tram later. It was really interesting and enjoyable and not at all crowded - maybe we were just lucky though. Our tickets were for 8.15 and they let us in early because there were no queues, but we still ran out of time to take the tram. Getting back was easier although the bus stop was still a bit confusing. The staff were really helpful and friendly. Definitely worth a visit."
,,A place to hangout with kids,5.0,,"This is the place where the kids enjoy the most, here they have a wide variety of wildlife brought here from around the world"
,,WOW...Amazing,5.0,,"I was not expecting too much from this, however I was gladly proved wrong, this was a fantastic night from start to finish and there were plenty of animals to see on the tour. I would also recommend the walk that you can do after the tour as you can see more and interact more with the smaller animals."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,A must when visitng Singapore. Dont bother taking photos because of near complete darkness unless you have a very good camera and enjoy the ride.
,,Beautiful zoo,5.0,,"Unfortunately we only managed to see the night safari which was great, an absolute delight for families with kids.
Don't forget to check the fire show before or after the night safari.
At the night safari: dont bother with your camera because its really dark, and using your flash is not allowed. Unless you have a very good camera to capture photos and videos at near complete darkness dont bother with it and enjoy the ride."
,,What a great and unique experience,5.0,,"Singapore Night Safari, the first in the world, immerses you into the nocturnal world while it is actually nighttime. First thing to know is to buy your tickets at Singapore Zoo (or, if you buy them from an app, pick them up at Singapore Zoo).

Once you've entered, you essentially have 3 choices - walk the zoo, take the tram, or get in line for the Creatures of the Night show. I would recommend doing the show to ensure you get a seat. The night show was not only good entertainment but it really focused on education of animals and the environment. It is well worth the time to attend.

The tram takes you through most of the zoo, slowing down at spots where the animals are likely to be. No pictures with flash as it startles the animals. The tram is set to a recorded track (which can be skipped, advanced, or rewinded by the driver). Not all animals will be in view (they are animals, after all) but we were able to see almost all of them. The tram ride takes about 40 minutes in total.

You can also walk the zoo. There are 4 ""sections"" but it is basically a big circle. Once you get half way through, you might as well finish. You see many of the same animals but you can stop to appreciate them (or search for them if you didn't see them before). There are also a lot of education displays about each animal. I would definitely recommend walking. The four trails are Fishing Cat Trail (you can see a fishing cat), Leopard Trail (leopards, lions, golden cats, as well as flying foxes), East Lodge Trail Malayan tigers, babirusas, bongos, and hyenas), and Wallaby Trail (Wallabies).

There are some feeding sessions (we didnt see them) for lions (8 and 9pm on Lion Lookout along Leopard Trail) and tigers at 8:30pm and 9:30pm at the Malayan Tiger exhibit (along East Lodge Trail).

A few other notes:

It will likely be busy (the trails weren't too busy but the line for the tram can be a bit of a wait)

There is food but most of it is immediately outside the park

Everything is expensive - it is a zoo, I think it is kind of expected"
,,Time well spent. A great activity.,5.0,,"Went with friends. Night safari is the bomb!
Great ride. Animals were all out and it was really awesome.

Many different language options. Food court is great and the lines while they seemed long moved quite quickly.

Highly recommended. I will be back if in the area."
,,Night Safari magic,5.0,,"The night safari at the Singapore is well worth a visit, you travel on the back of a ''train' through the open rang zoo and get to see lions, hyenas, hippos, tigers, rhinos,leopards and so much more. Well worth it and great value $65 SGD per person including transport to and from the Zoo. We also did the walking tour which showcased the local animals in their native habitat."
,,Really excited to try this but overpriced for what it is,3.0,,"The Night Safari was massively hyped as something really fun and exciting to do. I was completely sold on the idea and really excited that we were 'booked' in for the 1915 start. Only, you're not booked on it at all, you still have to get there early (really early, like half 6 latest) to ensure you enter. I had read it was first come first serve but when the cashier said we were booked on at 1915 I thought we were sorted for that time. Thankfully we had just finished eating about half 6 and thought we best join the queue. (Being British can help sometimes, we do love a queue.)
Queued from half 6 until 7 when the scrum moved forward and we were allowed in. We went straight to the 'Creatures of the Night' Show, where we had to wait again another 10 minutes before we could go in to the amphitheatre. (Outdoors and shows are weather permitting). The show itself is brilliant and Yamini is very funny and extremely engaging. It was well worth the wait.
To the team next for a night ride through the safari with commentary. Don't expect to take photos of this as there's not enough light. It was pretty amazing to see some of the animals up and about behaving close to there normal routine. It wasn't as great as we hoped but that's because we had spent 8 hours of the day in the zoo so we were very tired. Had we have had more energy, we would've enjoyed it even more and explored the walking trails. The fire show near the food area is pretty impressive. I'd stay and watch that. Having said that, it was significantly more than the zoo tickets and I don't think it's worth all the extra."
,,Just okay,3.0,,"I booked our tour through Viator and found their agent in Singapore excellent especially our tour leader Keef, he was very informative and kept a very close eye on his flock in the crowded environment. As for the park itself being our second visit I guess it had lost the wow factor for us. We had to que up for approx 20 minutes even though we had priority boarding and I was told later it was a quiet night. Once we boarded the tram I was unlucky enough to be directed to the front row of our tram where directly in front of you is a screen/window which obstructed my view and made it difficult to video the animals which I had been looking forward to this trip so avoid sitting up front if you can. Seeing the animals in that environment is lovely although I thought the tiger at the end of the trip around looked quite agitated. Not a lot more to do after the tram trip and don t think I would bother again finding the crowds a bit much at my age. The park is very clean and has a big variety of food outlets."
,,Unique night out,5.0,,"Not your typical zoos. In Singapore, night safari would be the preferred choice. Animals are more active. Weather is more pleasant."
,,Night safari disappointment,1.0,,"We were so looking forward to this on our trip but what a waste of time and money. The park was way too full. Queues for the jeep safari were horrendous and with one of the walking trails closed suddenly due to maintenance, it forced even more people into an already overcrowded area. Walking with my cane, I got so scared after having been bumped and jostled several times, we left, utterly disappointed. What has started as such a wonderful evening, ended with increased pain levels and frustration. I get it that you can’t control how people behave but if you put so many together in such a small area, you don’t give them much choice either."
,,Night Safari - a good experience,5.0,,"We went to Night safari on 20th Nov,2018.Night Safari starts after 7pm.Tickets can be booked in advance.Its an altogether different experience.From the MRT or bus stop there are shuttle services that will take to the zoo(fare 1SGD).

Its a tram tour with audio guide. We can see the night life of the animals. Kids get a bit scared as it is night time. But there is nothing to get scared."
,,Night Safari is different,4.0,,"The night safari is why I visited so can’t talk about the rest. It is well managed as an event, we went on a Thursday and I got the impression it was relatively quiet. I would imagine busy to hectic at weekends but their management systems seemed designed to cope.
The safari itself is good and then being able to wander is great.
The enclosures are quite well laid out making it relatively easy to spot animals.
Rated very good not excellent as I find zoos more difficult to handle as an idea."
,,Great idea. Shame about the idiots.,4.0,,"I went here one night after work and was really impressed by the whole set-up. The pick up was on time and smooth, instructions were clear, entry and tram-ride was well done, plus the walking trails and show at the end were fun. I really enjoyed seeing all the animals and how the organisers had managed to ensure guests safety. So, what really put a dampening on the whole thing was the stupid tourists alongside and around me that couldn’t or didn’t listen to the basic instruction of turning the flash off on their phones. I guess what I wanted was the organisers to say “sorry guys, we wanted you and you failed to heed that warning....so now you have to leave [and then escort these people off the premises]."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"The programme was attractive, the staff were friendly and the environment was conducive. Parking was easy and public transport was easily available. There were also many outlets selling drinks and nice food. It was certainly a very good venue for a very enjoyable night outing. My guests were very happy that I bright them there. They said they definitfly would highly recommend the venue to their friends as an excellent tourist attraction when they went back to their country. They said visiting the venue was really a very memorable event for them. I shared their view. I would certainly visit the venue again and bring my other guests there whenever opportunities arise."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Great trip but was hoping to be able to see even more animals. :) eg. More GREAT BIG Cats will be great!
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"It’s very family friendly venue to visit. However, the pathway is slightly tight should 2 pram be push even if from opposite direction."
,,2nd visit since 2012,3.0,,1st visit in 2012. Decided to visit with my mother. It was great experience. Will visit again next year to do River Safari as well. Live Singapore!
,,DISAPPOINTED visit.,1.0,,"Most animals were hiding in dark..... I only saw A lot of deer... Different type of Wild boar...., rather go during day time where u can see the animals clearly.Not worth. Waste time."
,,"Crowded, but smooth experience",4.0,,"We read all the advice before we left, so we were prepared for the crowds. We’d bought tickets in advance, for 8.15 entry. Food options are very limited, and quite expensive for the ‘hawker’ dishes available. The waiting staff noticed that we’re finished our dinner by 7.30, and they offered to organise early entry for us. This meant that we missed the worst of the crowds. The queue for the tram was still very long, but there are resting places all along the queue line, so we were able to cope with the wait. We are both seniors (63 and 74 years old) but nobody told us until the end of the queue that there is a priority line for older guests, or those with special needs. On boarding the tram, we remembered the advice to sit in the second carriage, in the right hand side. This was very useful advice, as we were able to see nearly all the animals. The commentary was in a English, and it was very informative. The tram driver stopped longer at some points, to enable everyone to get a good look at certain animals.One suggestion for improvement: the brochure could have more specific information about the tram route, and which animals might be seen in each location.We were too hot and tired to do any of the walking trails, but apparently you can see different animals that way.Signage regarding return to the city could be clearer. The $1 shuttle bus to the nearest MRT station is great value, and very convenient, but there is no warning that you must pay by MRT card. They won’t accept cash, and 2 people were turned away, without clear ideas of how to get back home.Overall - a unique experience that is very well-organised and moves crowds of people through very efficiently. All the staff were friendly and accommodating."
,,One of the best zoo adventures I have ever done.,5.0,,Fantastic tour at night looking at the animals. Not to be missed. Make sure you sign up for an early time as it does take 3 hours at least to see it all.
,,Night Safari Tour in familly,3.0,,The price is quite expensive for the activity. You do not see well animals during the night.I would recommend to visit the Zoo during days
,,Really fun!,4.0,,"The night safari was really fun but don't do it with jet lag. The darkness and the lulling of the tram put me right to sleepWe say Lions, Hyenas, Tigers, Hippos and many more active and awake. It was really cool before I dozed off!"
,,A night out,4.0,,"The night Safari was not bad at all. Aside from the queue lines which had guide posts that were too narrow for people with prams. The guides were helpful and even helped us with the stowing of prams when we got into the trams.Despite having a lot of Muslim visitors though, not much emphasis was put into having halal restaurants. They should improve further on this.The animals available for the nocturnal tour were of course limited to that particular segment thus many local and smaller animals were not included. Despite that, it was good"
,,great experience,5.0,,"had great time, may I suggest if you find your own way there ie via taxi which is not too expensive cost me $17 - 20 SD from Grand Hyatt Hotel , you skip the time of picking up other guests from hotels ie via a tour group and also the long queue standing in line at the venue of tour groups. There is a taxi stand which you can also catch a taxi back to your hotel. If you arrive on your own make sure you line up in the ticket queue, you will sometimes see a long line and it's actually a tour group waiting for other members. take an umbrella as it may rain. Book online definitely as you then only need it to be scanned by ticket office."
,,Night safari with the twins,2.0,,This is my sixth visit. I find there’s no innovation. The queue was long... there is no personal touch unlike before. There was a voice recording being played when we were on the train instead of a guide who explains the place when I went there years ago. The show was not as fantastic as before too.
,,"Good experience, but overrated a bit",4.0,,"Night Safari is a long-established attraction of Singapore. My family and me had visited it during the previous trip to Singapore 12 years ago, and believe me, it hasn't changed - the tram ride, the show, everything.

However, it is not the best of attractions of Singapore. It may be called thus, a bit overrated.

For one, the queuing. In spite of having booked with a travel agent who told us that the queue is a priority one, it took quite a time to be onboard a tram. The show that succeeds the tram ride is not that attractive.

Nevertheless, seeing the wildlife is a nice experience and enjoyable too. Otherwise, the attraction is not like a must see one of Singapore. Other attractions of Wildlife Reserves Singapore like the Jurong Bird Park are much better."
,,Don't bother,1.0,,Just don't waste your time. Go in the day time instead which was worthwhile. See nothing at night. We were late being collected from our hotel and then made the butt of jokes for staying at Marina Bay Sands. We ended up leaving in a taxi back to our hotel.
,,Worst line,1.0,,We booked our tickets through our hotel. We have a voucher to be changed as tickets at the venue. The line to get the tickets are long and disorganized. There were no staff to usher in the the line. It was a nightmare. We won't suggest this.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"I expected this to be the normal zoo at night time. Instead it is its own zoo, seperate to the day time. With animals active at night time.

The zoo had shows and a train that takes you around the zoo and into certain animal enclosures, allowing you to get close to animals. The train ride is great and had commentary talking you through the animals.

Definitely recommended are feeding times for the animals and the show"
,,raining but good,5.0,,"rain didnt dampen our spirits, the rides was well organised, we caught glimpse of lots of animals and the zoo was well maintained"
,,Interesting concept but hard to see animals,3.0,,The animals were hard to see since it was very dark and the safari bus didn’t stop for long enough. Price for the safari is fairly high given the amount you can see.
,,Good. But be prepared to queue,5.0,,"Great experience once you are actually on the safari. It’s about an hour long and goes so quickly because it’s so good.
We booked 8.15pm slot online. Turned up at 7.45 and it was so busy we didn’t get on a tram until 8.30
We used the bus service called safari gate to get there. Which was great. Open top bus and a tour of the city at night. We got on it at Suntec city shopping centre

Great experience. Saw lots of animals"
,,Nice!!,5.0,,Only place I have been where you can see animals at night time! Tram ride was about half hour and better the later you go as not busy at that time so better views of the animals!
,,Amazing night time zoo visit,5.0,,"On a recent family visit to Singapore, on a 4 Park ticket we visited here mid week. When purchasing the ticket you specify and book what evening slot you want. The Night Zoo begins at 715pm and the lighting is softened. There is also a road train ride around the park and it provides a great opportunity to see animals that are nocturnal and so wouldnt get the chance always during the day, The sound of a lion roaring and hyenas crunching on bones in the dark is eerie. A must do if in Singapore and get the chance. Well worth a visit, a unique experience."
,,Excellent family trip,5.0,,Very interesting experience for the whole family. Adults can have as much fun sa kids. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
,,Inside animals world at night ....Gimmick ?,3.0,,It is just ok. The marketing gimmick is quite high here. You basically see the animals at night in a zoo while you are driven in a vehicle. The only difference is daylight and night . The charges are quite high $42 per person and I somehow felt it is not worth.
,,well organised,3.0,,good show keep it up good time pass one time we can see children will enjoy good staffs nicely trained staffs
,,Timed ticket system needs some work,2.0,,"The Night Safari itself is a great concept. We really enjoyed seeing the animals a bit more active at night. We thought the lighting had been placed quite strategically by the park and made it a lot easier than expected to view the animals. To get the most out of the park you should get the tram around but also walk each of the trails individually - you see some animals on the trails that you don't see from the tram and vice versa.

However we had an unpleasant experience with the timed ticketing system which makes it hard to leave a positive review. We had bought the 4 park pass with a timed entry for 7:15pm for the Night Safari. The Night Safari opens at 7:15pm so we lined up with everyone else at opening. However shortly after 7pm they started letting people in early, by the time we made it to the front of the queue it was ~7:10pm. The staff member at the gate told us off for arriving early on our timed tickets (even though it was only 5 minutes early and with a long queue it would be difficult to get to the front of the line at 7:15 on the dot), and confiscated our tickets, putting them in a basket with a bunch of other tickets from another group who had the same problem and telling us we needed to wait at the gate until 7:15pm.

When 7:15pm rolled around the staff member started distributing tickets from the basket at random. This was a big problem as we had 4 park tickets and we hadn't used all the parks on our pass yet, so our tickets were still valuable, while a lot of the other tickets in the basket were for people who had other varieties of the multi park ticket / had already visited all the parks on their pass. The staff member gave one of our tickets out to another group of people and we had to go chasing after them to get it back. Even after we explained the problem with the process to her, she didn't seem to comprehend that there were multi-park tickets, or that anyone might want to visit anything other than the Night Safari! Not sure if this is how the process is supposed to work or if the staff just need some more training, but it seemed very odd."
,,Great,5.0,,"Very nice experience, better than what we imagine We can easily see the animals, I like better the night safari than the singapore zoo"
,,Night safari,5.0,,Great ride but avoid last ride of the day as they rush the ride a bit and you cannot get midway to walk around
,,great experience with Night Safari,5.0,,night tour was just right especialy with kids like us! great experience for all! it was a convenient and fun at theie Night Safari
,,Just Ok,3.0,,We felt it was over Hyped tourist attraction. I don't thing this place is in must visit list. Kids also get bored over a period of time.
,,Ok,4.0,,"It was at night and so it’s dark, difficult to see the animals. Not really active and pls buy mosquito repellent. If u dont have small kids or doesnt mind staying out late, it is advisable to go in ard 9pm above. It is really crowded for the 7:30 tram. We went for rainforest lumina first and we took the 9:15 tram. We board the tram as soon as we enter, no long queue! But we’re too tired to try the walking trail aftr spending the whole day exploring singapore. So I cant comment on tht."
,,Chaos,2.0,,"We booked a time slot and arrived 15 minutes in advance as suggested. On entering the zoo we were told that if we wanted to tour by tram that the wait time was 45 minutes but we could go by foot, which is the option we chose as the queue was crazy! We walked around the tracks and saw a few animals but not as many as we expected. For £25 per person this was terrible value for money.I would not recommend this at all. We were two adults but I know for sure that my children would not have enjoyed this. The zoo is about an hour's journey from downtown."
,,Night Safari visit,3.0,,Not much to see for the night. Not really recommend but if for night experience still worth to have a visit to the place.
,,Good one,5.0,,can make it more lively with half walk and half van so that people can spend some more time if needed
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"A very well organised set up, a brilliant walk around through each of the sections and really interesting animals. It was one of the best things we did in Singapore and I highly recommend a visit. It took us about 2 hours to walk, we preferred this to the tram tour."
,,Too Many People,2.0,,"My sister and I turned up at the Night Safari with hundreds of people ahead of us in the queue for the train ride around the zoo. Even though it was raining we decided to walk through the zoo rather than spend an hour (estimated waiting time from the staff) in the queue. We walked for at least 15 minutes before we actually saw an animal. In the end we figured that we made the right choice as we were usually closer to some of the animals than the train was and we were able to stop for as long as we wanted (or not, if the animals weren't in sight). After reading the brochure it appears that we would have spent more time in the queue than we would have spent on the train! I expected to see staff at some of the exhibits talking about the animals and making sure we were heading in the right direction as the lighting was quite poor."
,,Only very average.,3.0,,"Not great to be honest. Lots of people, so a great money earner for the zoo. But the tour itself left me somewhat underwhelmed."
,,Well time spent,5.0,,We could enjoy the most with the team ride. Animals were visible from a safe distance and it was quite a nice experience to visit a zoo at night
,,Terrible queues and unfair seating,1.0,,"We waited in a long queue for over 1 and a 1/2 hours to board a tram. As we neared the top of the queue, we noticed many people being given priority entry for no apparent reason ( I exempt the few wheelchair guests and their friends from this comment). Also other trams passed through partly full and apparently filled at other places. Also each tram has 3 carriages and stops regularly; if you are in carriage 3, you usually cannot see the animals when you stop; when you then pass the animals you cannot take reasonable photos (no flashes are allowed and tram is now moving) and have to try to remember what was said about these animals about 30 seconds ago. We paid over $40 each for a 20-minute tram ride which is very poor if you are in the back tram carriage. We were so disgusted we did not walk the other 2 trails that were available"
,,It's been years but Night Safari is still an adventure for all ages.,4.0,,Our girl scout troop had a lovely time at the night safari. We took the tram at 8:30 after completing the walking tour and it turned out to be an excellent decision because all the nocturnal animals were fully awake. My only suggestion is time your visit in order to see the show. We didn't make it to the 8:30 or 9:30 shows because it was full even when we arrived to the theatre 20 minutes ahead.
,,Very Disappointing Experience,1.0,,"This was a total waste of time and money. To appreciate the zoo you must do it in the day time. The night safari really has nothing special to offer and was boring. Few interesting animals were to be seen, mainly herds of deers. Save your money and put it towards going during the day."
,,Fantastic.. but a little scary!,5.0,,Apart from the creatures of the night show having to be cancelled due to weather this was a fabulous experience! Loved seeing the animals at night! Think only 1 was hiding due to the lightning! So many little creatures hiding but if you looked hard enough you could see them. Bat enclosure was so fun with them flying around! Animals certainly do make a lot of strange noises at night! In the pitch black was a little scary but loved it!! Xx
,,Expect big crowds,4.0,,"The night safari is a great night out in Singapore but expect massive crowds as it is a big tourist attraction.
Highly recommend getting public transport here. Catch the train to Khatib station on the North South line and they have a shuttle bus to the zoo for $1 each way from here.
The wait to go onto the tram car tour which is the highlight of the night can take up to and over an hour some times so paying the extra $10 to go in the express lane to get on is a great idea as you may not have time to do all the walking trails otherwise.
Plenty of animals to see and so many different options for food and entertainment.
Overall a great place for some nightly fun."
,,Not quite as good as expected,4.0,,"Don’t get me wrong, the experience was enjoyable and unique. I just didn’t expect such crowds (a line like Disneyland) to catch the tram. I also didn’t expect a recorded narration during the ride. Made it seem very artificial. Maybe going on Sunday night was the mistake. I would put this lower down on the list of must see attractions in Singapore."
,,Amazing super duper experience,5.0,,"First after reading reviews we thought of avoiding night safari. But word of mouth from friends made us to take it. We booked a package through zoo site. Its worth it.
1. It was heavily raining, so there was mad rush in tram, it was a blessing in disguise.. We took a walking trail. Thrilling beautiful experience.. It was as if walking in rainforest.
Small groups were there so it was good to see animals in peace. You have to have patience..if so u will get the best of it. Tiger feeding session and explanation given by Mr.sheik was excellent. Leopards hyena, bats, Asian lion..etc etc.
Too good. I recommend walking trail. Once done watch 20 mins show at the entrance cool show.
Only disappointment is connectivity to city by public transport is too less..taxi's r expensive at that time"
,,Lovely,4.0,,You get to see the animals in the natural habitat...many rare animals can also be seen...the tram has a audio in english which tells about the animals as we pass by..
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,"I visited the night safari while in a business trip and with a spare evening. It’s a jog out of Singapore, so plan on using Grab or taking public transportation to deal with the delays of rush hour traffic. Book your start time in advance so that you can get on the trolley easily. Large food court and lots of souvenirs at the entrance, but they’re on the expensive side. As for the zoo itself, make sure that you have a good camera that operates without flash, because no external lighting is allowed. Do the trolley for general orientation and then walk to areas that are of greatest interest. The otters had kits and were the most fun to observe. The park is very humid because of the dense tree canopy, so light layers are helpful."
,,It was ok.,3.0,,"Bit disappointed this time. We went about 25 years ago and loved it, so it was top of our list on our return to Singapore. We did enjoy the dinner in the restaurant, but the trip around in the tram was very uncomfortable as they make sure 4 people are squeezed into every seat. Walked the fishing cat trail, but didn’t see much of interest."
,,Family visit,5.0,,"Nice experience. Short motor tramp ride of around 30 minutes, showing how animals live in their natural habitat. You will see lions, tigers, Hippos, & other big animals sitting & relaxing.
No flash photography is allowed, so don’t expect much photos to be taken.
The lady presenting the show makes it very lively & interesting."
,,Night tour,4.0,,Had the evening tour package including dinner in the tiki tent. It was an amazing evening. Food was great. Wine was average.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,many animals failed to come out. lighting poor - from earlier raining. Tram is hell of noisy and smell of diesel!!!!!!! horrible smell. Should electric operated tram as it is also ideal for the environment!!
,,Amazing! Must See! Book Now!,5.0,,"What an amazing show and trip around the Zoo; I'm so glad I did the night safari - something you don't see everyday. Friendly staff, great atmosphere."
,,Weekend in singapore,4.0,,"This is my first time to visit night safari, its quite far to go there, 45mins using grab from vivo city. I got a cheaper ticket, 40$ because i bought from a sales counter like a ""tourism center"" in explanade underpass.. I took the forest lumina also as a one package.
I went for:
- trem car
This is very big area, we can saw a ""night animal"" near without any fences, we got an super dupper clwar explanation when we ride the trem car.. but, i can't see clearly the animal.. because there was ""evening to night"" time, and the animal is very sensitive with the light
- leopard show
This is very interesting, very creative, interactive, thanks to the host.. she could handle the atmosphere, she could speak (dont turn on flash light) in hindi, bahasa, tamil, mandarin, korea, japanese, and english. And the show is packed nicely.
- fishing cat
I can't see anything because it night already, i took the wrong sequence..
And the other two i forgot..
Lol"
,,Nice to do it once,3.0,,Something different to do once. Some paths are a bit too dark and poor signage. Sitting at the back trolley was not good coz the tram stops at animal exhibit at the front but the rear car can’t even see the animal enclosure yet. Then the tram starts to leave and the people in the rear cars don’t get a chance to take good still photos.
,,Something Different,5.0,,"If you’ve got a few spare hours in the evening this is a good place to go visit, it’s different from you’re normal Zoos due to the night time influence, and whilst some of the animals may be hard to see in the evening there are plenty that you do see great for families as well!"
,,Too dark,2.0,,Can’t see much. Too dark. Expected to have a clearer view of animals. Though most of the animals are well fed.
,,Night Safari - private tour,5.0,,"Excellent, expensive but well worth the money, a private tour makes all the difference with great staff, priority access and feeding the elephants a great bonus."
,,"Beautiful night safari, terrible queues!",3.0,,Beautiful night safari but the over an hour wait in massive queues beforehand dampened the experience. Had booked and paid online and expected to be starting in the time slot booked.
,,Cup weekend away,2.0,,"Biggest waste of time. Don't bother! All you saw were a lot of deers. Highly recommend the zoo during the day, but don't waste your time and money with the night safari."
,,"Went animal show, was looking forward to see the snake under the seat but not anymore, (perhaps safety reason).",4.0,,"Not much to see, just the trail n tram, the ticket pricing I felt a bit expensive for local. The restaurant priced is still very expensive but we ate. Staffs were polite n friendly."
,,Night safari,5.0,,It was a sudden visit due to my kid’s insistence but we enjoyed a lot. The tiger could be seen close. The voice guide was informative. Food was yummy.
,,Last 10 years same attractions :( Disappointing,3.0,,"Have visited night safari 3 times, they have not upgraded themselves/park at all. was feeling money wasted for sure since have not seen or experienced something new. Shows quality has gone down more preaching than entertainment. Que system during shows was completely missing. Please give your audience value for money, Zoo was much better than the Safari. You are charging Bomb to enter the park. Some of your volunteers don't understand children's feelings as well and came across rude (will not mention though I have recorded his name), vast difference when I visited first time to now. Surely a disaster."
,,Night safari,5.0,,"Although you could spend a good day here with the kids for adults I recommend you wait until dark.
Look up shows so you don’t miss any. The tram ride at night through the jungle is a must!
You can’t take flash pictures but the memories are so worth the while, Elephants, tigers and many more. There is a food court and being a veggi like moi you are spoilt for choice.
Don’t worry It’s safe at night ..... go enjoy! Xx"
,,Fun and Knowledge,5.0,,A place where you get connected with real time Jungle Safari a close view of various animals from all across world.Very Informative for Kids and well managed.
,,Slightly disappointed :(,3.0,,I was geared up to see something special here but was slightly disappointed with the value for money. Price for an adult ticket was nearly $50 and the train ride through the park only went for about half an hour. The weather was not kind with a massive downpour as we arrived (not much you can do about that) but the safari itself seemed rushed with no time taken to stop and watch the animals or take photos. Can’t say I’d recommend a visit.
,,General,5.0,,In the night Safari tour we in And the animals are free that is reverse of the zoo .it the told that Singapore Night Safari is one of its kind in the world.He in Bus an hour tour is Safari. We can see the animals like lion tiger are moving and many more animals are seen it is memorable visit specily for children and annimai lover
,,Great evening of zooing,5.0,,"One must definitely make the effort to go to the night Safari
Taking the safari tram through the forest gives a guided narrated tour through the park and get up close with the animals that are exclusive to nighttime activity
You can then take the walking paths through the park and spend more time learning about the animals
Definitely well worth the uniqui experience"
,,Amazing experience but big crowds,4.0,,"Having read the mixed reviews and now been myself I can totally understand why!

Seeing two leopards within touching distance except for a pane of glass and watching a cloud leopard jump into the trees in front of me...amazing! Being jostled in amongst huge crowds...not so good!

I arrived at 7pm, initially queued in the wrong place, then when I got to the ticket booth found the 7.15pm tickets had sold out and had to wait for 8.15pm entry (not sure why they do timed slots as it just seems to make the crowds worse). I then had to hang around for an hour, there's no seating unless you want to eat in very touristy restaurants (think theme parks), among lots of jostling crowds. I understand why people would want to go early if you have young children, but if you don't have this factor to consider here are my top tips for a more pleasurable experience!

- Buy your tickets on-line which will give you a guaranteed time entry (and discount)
- I think the 9.15pm slot would be the best entry time (some of the earlier crowds have then left and you would have enough time to see everything)
- When you get into the park head straight for the walking trails, there are four and they take about 20 min each (my experience was that the masses that you queue with then just head straight to the tram and queue all over again!) the trails were really quiet and I had the first one to myself
- You could then do the tram ride around the park after this (from 10pm onwards the queues for the trams seemed non existent), these run constantly throughout the evening leaving every 5-10mins. You don't book a time slot for these just wait to get on.
- Creatures of the Night show gets very busy, again try and go for a late slot. It's a bit gimmicky so I would prioritise doing the walking trails.
- And don't forget to wear bug spray!"
,,Night stroll with wildlife,4.0,,"A great little zoo and good way to see the animals more active than usual. Yes there are 'bad' reviews about not seeing the animals move, or the animals hiding etc, but what do you expect them to do.....dance and sing a song for everyone who walks by? I am all for animal welfare and believe they are looked after at the zoo, but they are in a closed habitat, what would you do if you were confined to your room for the rest of your life? I am sure you would have a favourite spot to sit. Anyway, enough ranting.

It is great to be able to walk at night, much cooler and pleasant, plus you get to see some really amazing animals. Our favourite was the Tigers and the pangolin.

We actually went there twice as my 4yo couldn't stop talking about it.

Plenty of taxis around at closing time so easy to get back to the hotel, not sure if the shuttle to the MRT still runs that late but the public buses do if you prefer.

Some tips:
1. Buy your tickets before hand online and save a few dollars;
2. Don't queue up for the trams straight away, everyone does and you might be waiting 30-45 minutes, study the map and go for a walk along the trails first;
3. Take your own water bottles, there are re-filling stations;
4. Get to the wildlife show early as it can become full fast;
5. The tram is the only way to see some of the animals like the Bengal tiger and elephants and hippos;
6. If you have young kids maybe take a pram or stroller, there can be lots of uphill walking, you can hire them but only if your kids are less than 3yo;
7. The park is open until midnight, make sure the kids are well rested beforehand;
8. There are fire dancers at the ticketing area, can't remember what time, maybe 10pm, ask one of the staff if you want to see this;
9. Bring umbrellas if it rains, there is not much cover."
,,Ok opportunity to see animals at night,4.0,,"Went to the night Safari as I was intrigued by the opportunity to see animals after dark, I was expecting more, perhaps it is sheer luck, it was late and there were not too many people so the wait for the tram was not bad at all. Dis not see much and had even less pictures, nothing to share. It was expensive to get there and to come back to town"
,,Good one time experience,4.0,,"I visited this place with family. Over all i woukd rate this as worth one time experience. The safari is well managed. There was long queue when we reached but they were well managed and we got our turn in 30 mins. The dafari was nice with commentary. It will also depend on the weather. When we visited the weather was relatively cool whichmade overall experience even better. Good to see those animals during night.
There was also a stunt show with some performers doing some dance and stunt with fireballs. It was nice
The animal show was average. Nothing great about it.
Overall i rate this as good. But moat other attra ctions in Singapore i.e. flyer, sentosa, gardens by the bay are much better.
Tips : beware of animal show timings and plane to reach there so that you can cover safari as well as the show."
,,Seeing animals is pure luck,3.0,,"Night safari is a good experience. However, the animals you see in dark is based on pure luck. They take you in a tram to view the wild nocturnal animals in their natural habitat. And along with it they announce what kind of animals you'll see on which side. It is highly recommended to sit on the right side of the tram. I did not see much animals. Also, the fellow passengers in my tram were noisy which spoils the experience further more. However, the clubbed ticket to zoo, river safari and night safari is always a good deal and it's nearby so you can definitely consider visiting it together as it's a new concept"
,,A unique glimpse into the tropical rainforest habitat .,5.0,,"The night Safari at Singapore is a unique and interesting experience ...a glimpse into the habitat of nocturnal animals of the rainforest ecosystem.
However it is steeply priced, if one decides to buy at the counter : SD 138 (adults) and SD 85 (child) ...it is advisable to check online offers and book beforehand for discount.

Safari started at 7 :15 pm...the queue was long but fast moving as the vehicles were arriving at a regular frequency.
There was a commentary going on in the bus which was open at both sides, and it was stopping at important points to enable a better view.
We could spot deers ,elephants ,
hynea, hippopotamus ,lion , bear etc .
There are various trails as well, like Fishing Cat Trail which one can follow if one wants to watch the animals closely.

Outside there are eating joints and shops for buying souvenirs etc."
,,Slightly above Average,3.0,,"The rating is based on the other wildlife parks that we visited, while it is good and a novelty to see animals by night the train ride would be better if they stopped at each animal for photos, they do slow the train however taking photos at night and moving tends to be difficult. It is however informative and the sit down animal display was good and fun for kids."
,,Don’t miss it,5.0,,"We visit the night safari and we were really exited! We recommend! All the animals,the trip in the night,the walk in the zoo was absolutely perfect!!! You got try it!"
,,Very popular attraction,4.0,,After spending the day at the Singapore Zoo I visited the Night Safari. The queues are long and waiting time for me was 15 minutes. The tram takes you around the park and if you are lucky you can see most animals while passing the enclosures.
,,Disappointing visit,2.0,,Disappointed with this attraction. Anyone who cannot walk a long way should not attempt to visit. The walk from the Zoo to the entrance of night safari is considerable and has nowhere to rest on the way. The staff on arrival at the queue area gave us priority boarding the train which was appreciated. Saw very few animals & hard to see as they are dimly lit. Impossibly long walk again to taxi rank
,,The White Lions Are Fake?,3.0,,Myself and partner are not convinced these lions are real at all. After looking into it; On your website you have a female and a male but in our pics you have 2 males? All of the pics/videos online and we have they are sitting the exact same spot (or slightly altered) and not moving (bar occasional blinks). Yes I know lions can be dosile but it looked so staged. Can anyone spread some light
,,Reach early to enjoy the night safari!,5.0,,"Night Safari at Singapore Zoo can be reached easily by public transport. There is a free shuttle from Khatib MRT. If you are travelling to SIngapore Zoo only for the Night Safari, try and reach by 7.30PM. This gives you time to watch the Creatures of the Night show, the tram ride and also explore some of the walking trails and catch some dinner before leaving."
,,In the dark,5.0,,"Nice place to go.Start with the show then hop on the train and then walk the zoo. You see a lot of animals very close, it feels like they are free.I liked the fruit bat the most.There are buses outside for returning to the city."
,,feedback on request from tripadvisor,4.0,,"It is a nice place to visit with the family. Though chose to take only the 40 minutes tram ride, we enjoyed seeing most of the animals. It was a bit dark and drizzling we were unable to walk around. It was crowded for first entry at 6.45 pm but it was less later entries. Restaurants outside the entrance had a good variety and thus you will go hungry."
,,Terrible experience,1.0,,"It is definitely NOT a safari... a zoo would be more appropriate but still terrible!! The lion is always in the same position (there are photos of only 2 different poses) which are totally fake lions because every time a tram passes by, the lion “yawns”. Also the staff at the noctural creatures show wasn’t friendly at all. DO NOT GO, IF YOU HAVE A FREE NIGHT, GO TO MARINA BAY AND SEE THE SHOW FROM THE SKY DECK AND THE OTHER NIGHT FROM BELOW IN THE GARDEN. This terrible zoo is only good for 5 year old kids or less."
,,We spent a week in singapore and this was one of the highlights,5.0,,The whole experience is great. The tram trip gives you a great introduction but walking around in the dark is a novel expand the teenagers loved it.
,,"Very good Safari, my son enjoyed it.",4.0,,"We enjoyed this very much. My son was very excited to see the animals around. Just one suggestion though I found that the directions by the staff were not great, causing us to wait in a longer line due to miscommunication, for families with kids this does get annoying because the little ones have less patience usually, but overall a good experience."
,,Very good experience for the kids!,5.0,,Very good experience especially when the keepers explain about the animals to the public.Convert the trams to electronic. The animals are breathing in the exhaust gasses.
,,Amazing Night Time Safari,5.0,,We had Linda Chan as our tour guide. She is simply the best! Very informative and entertaining. Somebody described her as enchanting. She is indeed!! We visited the nighttime zoo and had a dinner buffet before the ride. Everything was great. The tram took us around the zoo and there was plenty of animals to see in their natural habitat.
,,Spooky adventure !,5.0,,Great experience to see nocturnal animals at the night as the behavior is very different.Creatures of night is surreal and just can't be missed ! My wife got chosen to hold to a 10 foot python on the stage - along with experts obviously ;) The past of tram is fairly ok for one to see everything.Too costly photographs like the other sister parks - who pays 35$ for a pic in a frame !Think of reducing prices to normal levels and you can still make very decent money and people will definitely go back home more happy and content. You can do a much better job here with even better branding for yourself at the offer
,,A Different View,5.0,,Night Safari was an awesome way to experience the nocturnal animals that are so often sleeping when you visit during the day. More zoos should provide this natural adventure.
,,One of the BEST things to do in Singapore...NEVER MISS,5.0,,"It was my second time and I felt like I have never seen this before. Let me tell you one thing in case you are not much familiar with the wildlife. Majority of the animals are awake and active during the night and sleep during the day time. The best time to see the animals in their natural habitat is during the night.
Night safari is the best way to experience these animals in their natural habitat with utmost safety standards maintained by Singapore Zoo. You will have to never worry about them attacking you including the cat family. Some of the cat family animals are behind the glass like Leopard, etc.

I am an avid wildlife explorer and have traveled across the globe. Here are my recommendations for having the BEST experience during night safari.
(1) DO NOT visit during the weekends
(2) Go as LATE as possible. The last tram stops at 11.15 pm so plan to take 10.15 pm tram. Do check the changes in schedule though.
This way you will have less number of people in the park and especially less children. Children make lot of noise and scare the animals away. Lesser the people better is the animal viewing experience.
(3) Take the Tram ride first and complete it. Then DO NOT MISS out to go by the Trails.
You should be ready to walk around 3 Kms (about 2 miles). Wear good walking/running shoes for comfort and they make almost no sound. Try to keep a sizeable distance from the group ahead of you and behind you. Lesser the noise better is the animal viewing experience. Be calm and quiet within your group. COVER the ENTIRE Trail, do not miss anything. There is a lot to explore than what you see during the Tram ride.
The Park remains open till 12 mid night so you will have ample time. Don't worry and do not rush.
(4) NEVER EVER tease the animals or take flash photographs. DO NOT venture away from the designated trails.
(5) Last but not the least...enjoy the nature rather than concentrating on taking pictures and selfies. You will see some of the rarest breeds (very much active) in a very close proximity for unlimited amount of time.

This is an opportunity of lifetime so make sure you enjoy it thoroughly. Many travelers do not know that there are walking trails within the park. Walking trail is the best ever experience you can have than a Tram ride.

I hope you have a wonderful time there. If you follow my guidelines above you will see something you would have never expected for. So do not forget to thank me :)"
,,Fun,4.0,,Enjoyed the night safari and staff who are working there are definitely helpful and friendly. Will definitely come back
,,Animals in their natural habitat,5.0,,"We went to night safari on the first session, the queuing, while long, moved quickly and we were soon on the safari. The commentary was helpful and we saw most of the animals. My elderly parents enjoyed it also"
,,Very enjoyable evening,5.0,,"We decided to book excursions day by day while we were in Singapore due to the weather changing every couple of hours from a heat wave to a thunderstorm. The day we planned to go to the zoo we waited till about 3pm before booking our tickets online as we got news it would be a clear evening. Low and behold 45 mins after booking we experienced the biggest thunderstorm we had in Singapore! Come 6pm it was still raining and we thought shall we bother even going all that way. My app was telling me it wasn't raining in the area of the zoo though so we thought lets just chance it. The app was right and it wasn't raining and we had a great evening. All the animals were visible on the tram ride and the walking trail. We saw the tiger feeding as well which was nice. The last show which we were planning to watch was cancelled as the thunderstorm reached the zoo around 10.30pm but bar that we had a great time. A night safari is very unique so it was good to see, even for someone who is not the biggest fan of zoos."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Loved it. All the animals were out and visible. No really a uniquely Singaporean thing to see, but great fun"
,,Club it with the zoo,5.0,,Buy a combo ticket and it will be a good deal. It’s a half an hour night tram ride Where u can see animals in their natural habitat during a time when they are active. Although some of the animals may not be visible but it’s a different experience of looking at wildlife during the night.
,,Wonderful hosts,5.0,,"We had bought tickets for the night safari four days ahead, but when we got there, even having been charged, our tickets were never filled by viator, so the zoo had no record of us having admission tickets. Despite this, the wonderful manager at Reception really took care of us. They found us discounted tickets and ensured we got onto the tram and caught the last Creatures of the Night Show. It’s important to note that the zoo had no responsibility to do this for us at all. The team ride was great - the animals look healthy and you could see them easily unless they didn’t want to be seen with made me feel good about the size of their enclosures. The Night Show was awesome - definitely go to this!!! Afterwards we walked the trails to see more of the enclosures on our own time and this was well worth it. The place is really well organized and there are personnel all along the trail to make sure you’re safe. Highly recommend (and I am usually NOT a zoo fan). Thanks again Singapore Zoo for looking after your should-have-been customers"
,,Great stuff..,5.0,,Went with kids under 10. Everyone loved it. The train ride takes you through the safari experience after nocturnal show is over. Kids love spotting animals sitting on either side of the train. Keep water handy.
,,First Time At Night Safari,4.0,,"You should experience the night safari no matter what age you are. It’s a calming open tram ride that takes you st a leisurely pace along the path, the animals are in their natural habitat without any boundaries. Strongly suggest being a part of the Creatures Of The Night Show post the tram ride & try to take the 2030hrs ride."
,,Relaxing tram ride,4.0,,"The Safari consists of three parts:

1. Animal Show: Quite interesting.
2. Tram Ride: Very relaxing. There is enough light to see the animals at night. The collection of animals is also decent.
3. Walking Trails: Peaceful walk between trees with close encounters with animals.

Unlike the zoo, we didn't feel tired after finishing the whole place. I guess not having a sun on top of your head prevents exhaustion.

The price also felt a bit steep."
,,Not much to see,3.0,,"There are 7-8 trails for different animals like the leopard, fishing cat, lions, otters and a few others. Its dark and difficult to see much. Each trail takes only around 5-10 mins to cover on foot. There is a tram service, but there is a long queue and it docent look like it is needed. It is just like a zoo where they have provided a habitat similar to every animal's natural one. The show 'creatures of the night' is good and kids enjoy it. Worth a trip, overall."
,,A trip to Night Safari,3.0,,"Happily took my grandkids to Night Safari as requested. I was not expecting there to be a long wait for the ride and they began to show tantrums. It took us about 40 minutes to get on the ride. The ride was good with clear explanations of each station. While queuing up for the Animal show, my little grand kid needed to pee and we were not allowed to us the washroom which is nearer to the show area and the staff directed me to use the washroom next to the canteen. It was quite a bit of walking to do especially when the kid needed it. We managed to have good seats but the show was a little bit boring. We enjoyed the dance with the light fully displayed their skills & techniques. Grand kids enjoyed it so much."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Night Safari is brilliant! For most of the animals you walk along well signposted, fenced-in paths through the woodland from enclosure to enclosure. The lighting is enough to see the animals but very subtle so it feels like very bright moonlight. The animals are active as it is cooler and a natural time of the day for them to be moving around. It is also possible to ride the “train” around the safari with useful commentary on the animals you pass. Worth every penny, but a late night if you have very little ones."
,,Great for Children,5.0,,"The zoo in a different perspective especially for children. They were excited to see the animals, especially when they’re active."
,,Great concept with obvious flaws,3.0,,"The idea is great and we generally had a good time, but everything is packed with people so that you're likely not going to do more than 2 or 3 things. A 20 minute bus ride and a 20 minute animal show. In between 1-2 hours of waiting."
,,Interesting safari,4.0,,"This safari is good for kids above 8 years. We find that we need to focus hard to see the animals in the dark and feels kids too young will not enjoy that. The park spreads with walks. A word of caution, the walks has certain stops with roof cover, but mind you the pillar of the roof is exactly at the walkway. As the entire walk is the dark, one child in our group actually walk right into the pillar and hurt his nose badly. So be mind of that.

Tickets, we made mistake of getting from Headout which claims to offer slightly cheaper tickets. Realized it is scam. Actual amount charged is higher. Be warn of this.

A good pair of walking shoes needless to say as the park do not have seats around to rest at all.

Depending on your visit day, allocated half hour queue time for show.

Our children really enjoyed the park especially bats section."
,,Review,4.0,,Good adventure. But it’s should have been a bit more exciting if the stop was a bit longer to see some of the animals. Other wise it’s was good.
,,Good one for children,5.0,,This is good attraction for children. Because they enjoy a lot than adults. But it’s one of the most watchable attractions. Don’t accept too much
,,Nice end to a visit with the Zoo,4.0,,The tram ride is fairly short around 35 minutes but it is informative with plenty of big animals at close proximity- if you love tigers and lions - this is the place to come
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"The Night Safari was a great experience.

We enjoyed the walking paths, show and the tram ride as all provide different aspects that the other doesn’t.

Easy to get to via public transport. If you catch the train to Khatib, the zoo has a shuttle service directly from there every 15-20 minutes for $1."
,,Excellent Safari...!!,5.0,,"Went there was my family. The night safari is extremely good. The Safari is there every hour. Though we had the 8.15 pm entry tickets we were allowed to get in once the 7.15 pm batch of people were inside. Would strongly recommend that the moment you arrive at the Safari, pls take the tickets quickly (basis which you get the time slot). Inside everything is managed pretty systematically. We had selected the tram ride option for viewing the entire park which turned out to be a good decision. The park is awesome. You can see the animals with close proximity. Great experience.

Inside there are lot of restaurants. Would recommend that one buys the food tickets (buffet) online rather than coming to the park and buying the same. One can save good amount of money. Saw quite a few people taking this option...!"
,,Nice experience,5.0,,"Its a nice experience in the night, and the kids get very existed. However, after the tramp ride the shows get full fast, so if you are not early in the line, you could do the safari, but miss seeing the shows."
,,A New Experience,4.0,,"Loved the experience of seeing animals up close in the dark, being able to interact with them. Sometimes they are hiding but if we wait long enough, they will surprise us!"
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"If your in Singapore, then a visit to the Night Safari is a MUST!! A word of advice, if you get there for opening hours at 7.15pm then I highly recommend having some dinner first and skipping the mad rush to get through the doors with the other 100 people! The best time to go would be around 8.30pm when the mad rush has disappeared, and your able to get on the tram a lot faster."
,,Novel Idea,4.0,,"This place opens when others are shutting. Next door to the River Safari and the zoo.

The night safari takes place when it gets dark. You can take the road train around the park which takes around 40 mins. You can also walk around the park on various trails. There is also a 'animals of the night show'

First of all let me talk about the crowds. These are large when the park opens. Everyone heads to the road train or the show. A little tip. Don't do either initially. Go on one of the self guided trails and let the mad rush die down.

Another thing on queuing. Please just take your turn. Don't just try and push your way through as several older males did as we were queuing. The queues are well organised.. be patient.

The animals in the night show was not very impressive. In fact training what are wild animals to perform goes against the grain for me. The show maybe lasts for 15-20 mins and they bring on various nocturnal animals. As usual there is a conservation message.

The safari is on a road train consisting of about 4 carriages. The queue to board the carriages is well organised. As you are driven around you are told no flash photography but do people listen?? No!!
There is a running commentary on the vehicle as you are transported around but I found at times it was inaudible and at other times the commentary was either ahead of or behind the point we were at! Frustrating.
There are a number of animals you see along the way. Why they stay next to the road and don't wander off I presume is down to the food they have close to the road.
We didn't do any of the walking trails but there are more animals to see along these trails.
There are a number of eateries and gift shops as you would expect mostly based around the central courtyard. Overall an interesting visit but take my advice and let the crowds die down first."
,,Nice Experience,4.0,,Night Safari is a nice experience for young and old. Besides the train ride you can do several walking tours and see a lot of animals in their natural habitat.
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"A fun place to visit.Advice: try to see the animal show first (in the theatre area, this takes approx 15 minutes), then get the caravan/cart around the park (they leave every 15 minutes), this takes approx. 30 minutes. After this you have the option of dining at the place, they have some restaurants there. Alternatively, you can walk around the park as well to see the animals at your own pace (we did this after the show, then the caravan, then the trails) - you also see some animals that the caravan route does not show.Hope this helps!"
,,Visit to night safari,3.0,,the visit was good we had visited night safari on 17 Oct 2018. I had visited along with my spouse and children
,,fantastic place for family,5.0,,love it. best place for young and old family. will be going back there soon. very crowded on Sat. better visit during weekdays.
,,Night Safari,2.0,,Not many animals to see. Most animals are either asleep or hiding. suggest to have more different animals in Night Safari.
,,A must see!,5.0,,"I was initially skeptical about visiting a zoo while traveling, but I’m very glad I did the night safari. It was great being out in the cool evening night and exploring without the sweltering heat. The tram ride was comfortable and it was great to learn about the animals and see how well they’re housed. Thanks!"
,,Impromptu visit,5.0,,"It was very crowded being a weekend even though it was just a random usual weekend, no special holidays. Good surprise for my kid where we decided to visit the night safari when he asked for the zoo."
,,Great night out,4.0,,Second time at the night safari and our children as delighted as the first time! Seeing the lions being fed was a highlight.
,,Must visit for thrilling walk safari,5.0,,very much enjoyed walking and looking at animals in their natural habitat. tram ride was excellent showcasing and detailing every animal en-route.
,,Worth the money,5.0,,Great fun at night safari. We did the tour and all the walking trails. Remember insect repellant! Great way to see the animals.
,,Enjoy the park,5.0,,"We enjoyed the park . Especially the night creature show and the Flying Fruit Bat house. We walked around the park around 10:30 and was told that there is no more tram from the station near the bat house back to main station. We need to walk back. I suggested This tram should run until the park closed , as many guests would already feel tired walking all the way to the bat house , but no tram back, especially for people with young kids and elderly."
,,"lovely trails, ride not very good",3.0,,"Nightsafari has very nice trails. When you spend enough time you're able to see most of the animals. Sometimes you can even ""interact"" with them. Nice atmosphere when walking around. The later it gets the less people are in the park.The ride around the park at the beginning wasn't very good. Some interesting information but only short stops to see the animals."
,,Proud Singaporean for night safari,5.0,,Experience was great for each and every time we’re here. Will be better if there’re more shows though as creatures of the night is always the main show available.
,,Need to innovate,2.0,,"I will strongly recommend Night Safari to introduce new shows and performances, if it is to attract patronage from existing and new customers. I must be visiting Night Safari the umpteenth time over the last 15 years, but it does not seem there have been much changes to the format and structure. The ‘Creatures of the Night’ show has in fact got shorter and worse, specially not worth standing in a long queue late at night.I would suggest more guided walks, with shorter performances at various stations. It will also entice the crowd to walk more than taking the train."
,,Nothing similar,4.0,,"A must do, but need to be longer and better arranged. I haven't seen the white tiger cause it was sitting at the end of the tram and driver stepped on it as soon as the narration finished."
,,2018 Mar - Night Safari Outing,5.0,,"It's our Saturday night outing. I and my 2 wheelchair elderly had a good time and experience sighting these nocturnal animals, just like when the sun sets, it's party time for them. The animal show was great but ended up too soon. The staff were friendly and accommodating and assisted us throughout our adventures in this wheelchair friendly park."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Excellent, our 6 & 8 year olds loved it, and the grandies - seeing the animals at dusk was really calm and magical, and you don't get a sense there are any cages - which considering there are lions and tigers...."
,,A different experience,5.0,,"Its a different way to experience the animals and the jungle
Book tickets online - get the 7:45 pm show - do the tram ride - watch the creatures of the night show and then walk to the entrance to watch the fire show...thats the best way to experience all the things that the attraction offers
Would definitely recommend"
,,try once with no expectations,4.0,,"with lots of hype my expectations were little higher. The entry is crowded as people Q up 45 minutes before the time slot. reception was good. The fire show at the entrance is good. There are restaurants at the entrance including two Indian ones. The one near the reception sells some indian snacks. The one near the exit is expensive.
immediately after the entrance you have the long Q for the tram which takes you around the Zoo with a commentry which is well timed. The animals are trained to stay at the clearing with a small information and story about these animals. The authorities have done a great job taming the wide animals which are seen not to make any noise and stay at one place for the entire show. Even the hyenas stay put.
The duration of the tram ride is about 20-25 minutes and each tram has three carts with a seating capacity of around 50-60 people per ride. The frequency of the ride is 7-10minutes. Yes the ride will give a satisfaction of seeing many animals which is a great success for the show.
there are 4 trails around the park which will be thrilling.
The creatures of the night shows was not a good one but you see some animals coming and going, but you can see people lining for it even 30 minutes before the show time which is at 7 15, 8 30, 9 30pm and the show lasts for 20-25 minutes.
Only one toilet facility available inside the campus.
overall it was not upto the expectations but a nice show put up by the authorities.
transport facilities after the show is available outside the arena."
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"A nice place but there is so many people, you have to wait in line for at least half an hour. The tour by bus is good and there are some trails you can follow by foot"
,,A trip to the Animal kingdom,4.0,,"Best time to visit night safari is evening 4:30 . There is a fire show at 5 pm , after that attend animal show at 5:45 pm after that have a tram ride round the park . These are the 3 things to do here . There are few rare animals like tiger, lion , rhinoceros, hippopotamus etc... it's a long way from city , literally takes 1 hr to reach . The fire show and tram ride are best out of 3."
,,Even if you don’t like zoos you’ll like this one!,5.0,,What a fantastic experience. I usually avoid zoos as I don’t like animals being caged but this one came so highly recommended I went with my 11 year old son. We both loved it. The enclosures are very natural and you get a good close look at the animals without bothering them. After travelling around on the vehicle we did the walking tour. This took over an hour so best to start the evening early if you have young ones with you.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Myself, hubby and two boys 5&9 went. It was very very busy, but well organized. They had so many mini busses ready so waiting time was not to bad.We also enjoyed fire show just as we walked in.The train ride in no more than 30min. So bit steep price, but kids enjoyed it. We saw Rhino, bear, tigers, lions, and other animals like Zebras, Kudu etcAt the end of train ride you are invited to another animal show. I was good again, talked about Owls, snakes, parrot It was good evening out with kids, but once is probably enough."
,,Awesome Night.,5.0,,Went to the Night Safari after the zoo. It was awesome. I have read other reviews that said the animals were hard to see. We didn’t have that problem. We could see just about every animal we looked for. The bats were a lot of fun - they get very close to you. We found it best to walk around the tracks at the start and ignore the tram. We walked the whole park and then at the end jumped on the tram for the guided tour. There was no line and no waiting then. When the park opened at 7:15pm everybody ran for the trans and the lines were huge.
,,Overall good,4.0,,"Pretty crowded even when we visited it on a weekday night, lots of tourists. The complimentary tram ride queue is long but move fast. The staffs are friendly and helpful. The trail walks path are pram friendly. Apply lots of insect repellent and wear a pair of good walking shoes. The only con is that some animals are so well camouflage that you can see nothing."
,,A bucket list experience,4.0,,"Who would have thought there was such an animal as a bearded pig! After viewing the show we boarded a jungle vehicle for a tour of the zoo viewing predominantly the nocturnal animals. The tour was informative but the audio wasn’t always working so we missed some information about the animals. After our tour we walked the vehicle circuit stopping at each animal enclosure and got much more out of the experience. This took just under two hours but was very enjoyable, educational and highly recommended."
,,Night safari with varieties of animal,5.0,,"Basically as it should be for night safari but the outstanding here is that there are many type and species of animal to observe. Both interesting for tram and walking. Not an idea on rainy day because most of the activities and shows are outdoor. Spend about an hour, more or less up to each person. Suitable for every age. Nearby the Singapore Zoo so you can put it into one day tour for both if you are not too tried lol."
,,Singapore Night safari a unique experience not to miss !!,5.0,,"Well organized park, quickly managed ques for the tram rides, walking trails are well designed and gives a feeling of walking in a forest. Creatures of the night show was ok - can be better in terms of animal acts but having them trained for night show with so many people is a BIG challenge I guess. Don't be anxious about walking the trails it is safe and you will find park attendants on the way."
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Our very first time visiting Night Safari, ticket includes tram ride (40mins rides).

We had our dinner at Jungle Rotisserie, the foods was good! Especially the mushroom soup

Be there early, so that you could catch the Thumbuakar Performance (Fire show) while having dinner at Jungle Rotisseries. This is the fire show at the entrance courtyard (located at the outdoor siting of Jungle Rotisseries) which is performed at 07.00pm, 8.00pm, 9.00pm and 10.00pm.

Take note that you will have to queue at least 30mins prior to start of Creatures of the Night Show. The seat are limited, hence be there early to grab a good seat. It is a 20-minute Creatures of the Night Show Performed in the big outdoor amphitheatre amidst the rainforest, this show is weather permitting and is performed at 7.30pm, 8.30pm, 9.30pm and 10.30pm.

Go for tram ride after the show, usually once the night safari open, the tram queue are really long. You can play around with your route. We love the tram ride, as it is really close to the animals and very much different from day time. Trust me, you dont just see their eyes!

Proposed itinerary*:-
6pm Dinner at Jungle Rotisseries
7pm Thumbuakar Performance
7.15pm Queue for Creatures of the Night Show
7.30pm Creatures of the Night Show
8.00pm Queue for Tram ride
9.00pm Own leisure
*For reference only*

Hope the above tips help to smoothen your journey.

Happy holiday!"
,,All the animals were out!,4.0,,The animals did not disappoint! The long lines after the rain stopped did disappoint. And they let the next group in early too. Eventually they opened more lanes and all was good.
,,Excellent,5.0,,We are Singaporean and my children have never visited night safari.This is their first time visit night safari. They like it so much!!!Thank you!
,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,"It’s an amazing place to visit. Great walking trails, impressive lighting effects in the enclosures, awesome shows. Great place for young children and adults! Pride of Singapore!"
,,Too long to wait for tram,3.0,,"This is my second visit to the Night Safari and this time I was disappointed. After having a wonderful afternoon at the River Safari we went to the Night Safari. The show has good but then we were told to wait for the tram and it would be only a 20 minute wait but instead we waited in line over one hour. I feel the staff should have suggested we walk around the Night zoo first and then come back to the tram. We were all tired and cranky after waiting an hour for the tram. On a positive note, the food at the restaurants was really nice."
,,Must visit,5.0,,This was a great evening in Singapore. The zoo does some really amazing conservation work and the safari itself was remarkable. We saw loads of stunning animals up close and the commentary was really informative. Great way to spend part of an evening.
,,Not much to see. Long lines,3.0,,We waited for ages and to be truthful this was not an up close and personal experience. Saw only a few animals. Quite disappointed.
,,"Great experience, organisation could be improved",4.0,,"We had a great experience at the Night Safari, but suggest there could be some improvements made to the organisation at the venue. Ordering our tickets online was a breeze, but when we arrived it was unclear what we were required to do. Some improved signage or information in the confirmation material would be helpful."
,,New experience,3.0,,Overall ok. Should show more animals. Very less animals. The timing is very short. Even the show duration is short not many animals.
,,Indian buffet,3.0,,"Variety was limited at indian buffet. However, service by staff was excellent. Attractions at safari could be more robust."
,,Great evening,4.0,,"Lovely experience for our friends from overseas. Only complaint is ""try buying tickets on your mobile phone in dim lighting and ridiculously small font size"". The app needs help!"
,,Average idea executed well,3.0,,"If you have seen a good quality zoo, the night safari will sound like a compromise. It is a fast paced tour of some limited animals, stopping for a few seconds at some spots and not stopping at all at many. The entire tour takes about 20 min. I was shocked to see so many people lined up for the night safari, perhaps one of the reasons they had to rush up things.What we loved more than the safari is the Fishing Cat Trail. I feel they have used a wrong name - the trail leads to a bunch of interesting animal sightings - one trail after the other. It is more like a night zoo. We spent about 45 min going through all the trails."
,,Was good but....,3.0,,The night safari was quite crowded and we had to wait a long time in a queue to get on the tram that took us around. The safari was quite short and although you did see some animals it lacked the wow factor for us. Nice but not amazing.
,,Great,5.0,,"Outstanding visit, a must see, easy to navigate the park, great layout, ideal time to see the animals."
,,A Unique Experience,4.0,,"The staff were very friendly at Night Safari. I bought my tickets online starting at 2015. I arrived probably 25 minutes late and walked right in and got on a tram 10 minutes later. The tram ride has several free range exhibits and lots of deer. They do have some other unique animals to see. Some of them were sleeping which cannot be helped. I did not do the jungle walk but I would recommend taking the time to do it as there are many other animals on it. I watched the Creatures of the Night show which was entertaining. The animals seemed happy and well cared for. This was a really fun experience and I wish other places had something like this. Night Safari is an entirely separate park from the Singapore Zoo, so you should do both!"
,,OK visit,4.0,,"Had been to the Night Safari 3 times previously but was the first time with Kids. We had booked for the 715pm session as we were all still struggling with jetlag. Unfortunately a lot of the animals were still waking up so missed lots of them. In hindsight we should have done a later booking and done it later in the week once adjusted.
There were lots of queues but the lines all moved fast.
Of the 4 parks we visited with the parkhopper plus cards we ranked this 4th."
,,The night safari is a must do experience.,5.0,,"Friends, who had lived in singapore, recommended the evening safari and we were not disappointed. There was a really good comentary on the train and we were close up to the animals. After the train tour we walked two of the routes. There are plenty of helpful staff on hand. There is also a variety of food outlets."
,,Beware of ‘night safari with entrance’ tours,4.0,,Night safari itself is incredible- you see the most amazing sights (flamingos at night can’t be beaten). But there will be queues... don’t pay extra thinking you’ll get through faster. Buy Night Safari entrance and transfers!
,,Disappointing,3.0,,It is very crowded for the Safari. I was not happy when we got in line at 730pm for an 815 reservation and people that came after us with 915 reservations were moved around us and boarded the tram after we stood in line for almost an hour. Not worth the time or wait. Go to the zoo instead during the day
,,Cousins visting Singapore,5.0,,A Night zoo like no other. Great layout set up for animals and tourist alike. Enjoyable commentary throughout the ride.
,,Good Experience Terrible Transportation,2.0,,"Distance from ticketing booths to entrance is inconveniently and annoyingly far, this is very punishing for family wih young children.

Staffs at ticketing booth could use extra training in hospitality service and manners.

This is a unique and thoroughly enjoyable experience for family.

Return transportation need to be improved. Taxis were scarce with long lines, shuttle bus to Khatib was far and few in between. Public bus were available but no clear destination explanation for non locals."
,,Good but could be better,3.0,,"It is definitely an attraction to visit (for first timer) but little has changed over the years, still very much the same old things. After entering the park, most visitors have a choice of 3 main activities, catch the wildlife show, take a tram ride, or go for a trail walk to see the animals. Nothing really wrong about it, just felt jaded. Be prepared to spend 2-3 hours at the place.

Logistics definitely needs to improve. These include
- Shifting the ticket booth closer to the main entrance
- Having something to keep the crowd ‘entertained’ while waiting in the queue area for the “Creatures of the Night”show. Does the crowded really need to stand about in semi darkness too?
- Better lighted park’s trail especially at the edges.
- Placing some seat along the trail near the animals enclosure for rest break and viewing the display.

Staff are mostly friendly and helpful. Tram ride was informative and a good way to see the whole park. The whole eco theme being weave into the “Creature of the Night” show was also a nice touch and interesting.

If you are lucky, you may even catch the feeding of the animals while exploring the trails.

The park has lots of potential to improve the overall visitor’s experiences and encourage repeat visits just need more attention to details."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Wow! Such a nice experience, we loved it! We enjoyed the creatures of the night show starting at 7:15 pm. I totally recommend you NOT to queue for the tram after the shows, because you’ll waste your time and leave in a crowded tram. Choose to walk on dedicated trails and take the tram later, when the crowd leaves. Concept is really lovely, we had a great time. Definitely will visit again!"
,,Excellent trip,5.0,,"The night safari at the zoo is definitely one of the highlights of our trip - I can't recommend it enough. It is dark and they use lights that the animals think is moonlight. You go round on a little ""train"" first and see the animals close up in their ""natural"" surroundings and behaviours. Once this part is finished you are free to walk the walks at your own pace - I would thoroughly recommend doing this - you see so much. The whole this is very well organised and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. I'd suggest trying to sit in the back row of the front ""carriage"" for the views. I'd also suggest booking in advance to avoid the queues."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Straightforward and what you see is what you get. The Creatures of the Night Show was an excellent starting point for this safari. The host was brilliant. Very fun and humorous, with a lot of knowledge and really captures the crowd and kept their attention. The safari itself was amazing, and probably the closes you may get to wild animals without a fence between you and them. Lasted for around 45 mins under a moonlit night sky. At the end of it, you can walk on some of the trails in the park, away from the wild animals. An excellent idea and definitely worth the money and the experience"
,,Great Night Out,5.0,,"My mother and I recently visited the Night Safari as part of an organised tour (dinner and priority tram package). The buffet dinner was tasty although a bit rushed and relatively expensive for what was on offer. The included priority tram ride was also a positive as we didn't have to queue- we boarded the tram straight after dinner. The tram ride itself was fun and we were lucky to see nearly all the animals. After the tram ride we had approximately 1 hour to explore the rest of the activities. With such a short time we opted not to watch the fireshow or Creatures of the Night show, instead choosing to explore the trails. We went on two of the trails and were lucky to see nearly all the animals close up. I found them to be much more active at night. A word of warning, the trails are very dark and not well lit and although signposted it's quite easy to lose your way (this all adds to the experience). Some helpful staff had to direct us back to the exit and we arrived just in time to catch our bus back to the city. All in all a fun night out and highly recommended."
,,Shades of Grey,3.0,,"The Night Safari seems to be more popular than a day trip to the zoo. I guess most people visit because it is a different experience.

I think that the management need to consider putting a ticket booth by the night safari entrance - otherwise you have to walk to the zoo ticket booth to get your night safari tickets and back track all the back to the night safari entrance.

The waiting time to board the trams that take you through the park was about 40 minutes. The excitement built up - but in reality the tour felt like we were watching everything in shades of grey. You are not allowed to take flash photography - and so it is not possible to take good photos of the animals.

It was interesting to see the animals in their natural habitat - although I guess most were used to tourists passing by on the trams.

All in all - I felt that it was an expensive tour for what was on offer. I would have preferred to go to the zoo during the day time.

To get to the night safari, we took the bus - but thankful that as it was late at night when we finished our tour - buses were still running.

There is a dining area where there is a choice of some eating stations serving different cuisines. I found the prices to be on the high side and did not think that it represented value for money."
,,A great different experience!,5.0,,"We've had visited the day Zoo earlier and find the night safari to be a different experience! It was a very wonderful experience as it was the first for my 7yrs old daughter. During the whole night safari tram ride, she was very excited as she gets to learn first hand experience in identifying the different types of nocturnal animals, which is fantastic!

We've got the 7:15pm ticket entry (English tram ride) booked in-advance through klook.com, but we paid additional for VIP ride at the counter, for that, we don't have to que as long as the others and had a shorter entrance path to the tram, also, we were each given a free headset for the trip too (though you can use your own headset). The narrator recorded for the ride are very clear and had made the trip pleasantly interesting. We also have ample time to have our early dinner and rest before the tram ride.

The whole tram ride was perfect! it had been raining earlier during the day so by night, it was cooler and the animals actually came out to play so we were lucky to see the animals clearly in the dark. Though we didn't get to do the walking trail as our daughter were getting tired after the tram ride but as the whole visit is very much worthwhile! We will surely come back again in the future!"
,,Tag it on to the zoo!,3.0,,"We visited the night safari. After arriving on public transport (get a taxi!) we spent a couple of hours on the land train & walking around. To be honest it was just like a zoo but you can’t take photos as you can’t use flash & it’s too dark. An interesting experience but wouldn’t rush back (unlike the zoo which is really good!). If we were to do it again, I’d manage the day differently & add it on to the end of a visit to the zoo/river safari which are next door. If you haven’t purchased tickets in advance, you have to walk to the zoo entrance to buy them.
Definitely recommend getting a taxi here though if you’re staying in the tourist areas - much easier & really reasonably priced."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"The first thing that hit me was the fact that Night safari seems to be a lot more popular than day trip to zoo. It was crowded than any mother place I visited in Singapore.

There are walking trails and an interactive tram trail(40 minutes). We chose the later as we travelled with a couple of kids.

Tram service is quite pleasant and informative. Spotting animals is not a problem at all. Much like the day zoo, most of the animals were in open area with natural formations separating them from us.

Flash photography is prohibited. So not much to capture the experience.

Creatures of the night show is good. Yet another unique aspect of the night safari.

Dinner in ulu ulu was good. Loved the fact that Indian food was available and good to taste."
,,great night,5.0,,"paid for the dinner and safari the dinner was ok not I would do that again 45 dollars per head not really worth it.

but the tram ride and walking tours were great a different world at night. so close to the animals and to see some great animals sleeping was just a treat.

well recommend."
,,Not what we were expecting!,3.0,,"We trundled around the Park on a 'noddy' train only to find the animals in dim pools of light some of whom looked very sad and fed up. We have experienced Zoo's when the animals looked lively and happy but not in the night safari here.
We would not recommend this as a value for money visit as we just seemed part of an endless procession of trains full of people and it was so commercial not to be worthwhile."
,,Great experience.,4.0,,It was a great experience to get in night safari. Please check in in the early evening show that there is some activities like feeding to lions and by the staffs
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The night safari started in the gardens for the light show then to the Marina Bay Complex for a trip to the 56th floor for a spectacular view of Singapore by night from there a boat ride past many of Singapore's may water side venues and then return to the hotel by 10.30pm.
,,great experience,5.0,,We spent great three hours in the park and enjoyed the unusual proximity to the wild animals. The park is well maintained and organized. We appreciated the promotion of sustainability. The only downside was the use of diesel trucks. We suggest changing to electrical engines.
,,Super Nice,5.0,,"Nice trip and exotic experience. At night so quiet, can enjoy family time. Interesting animals and night feeling, different from the day time."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Great experience to end our time at the zoo. A lot of the animals were still hiding and the kids and tourists were so loud that I wouldn't come out either! Could have been better in that regard, but glad we stuck around to do it."
,,Enjoyed Night,2.0,,My family (4 of us) visited Night Safari 2 days ago. We expected active wild animals but we could not see many but just a few small animals different from advertisement. I would rather recommend to visit Singapore Zoo at daytime if you have children.
,,very artifical,2.0,,"Visited few days back, was expecting something better, but found everything to be so artifical. Animals were so much not like wild but tamed pets, dont think they were the way they naturally are. Zoos in Delhi are way better or may be the national parks and wildlife safaris anywhere in India. You get to see the wild animals in their natural form , being wild. Singapore night safari was basically for people's entertainment and to earn money , nothing to preserve the animals in their natural form or habitat. The Creatures of the night show was good though thanks to the hostess. Fire show was again nothing extraordinary. I think just to give people the count of inclusions."
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,"I decided to do the Night Safari thinking most animals would be inactive during a day time zoo visit. The safari has three segments a vehicular tour, animal shows and an unaccompanied walking tour.

Everyone arrives for the 7.30 tour so to avoid the queues I did the walk first. The animals I saw were very underwhelming, most were just silhouettes. It was raining so this may have had an impact.

By the time I finished there was no queue for the tour. In fact I got a seat to myself so could easily see both sides. The tour was the highlight with the animals fed to encourage them into viewable positions.

The Creatures of the Night show was also enjoyable.

Overall though, I usually enjoy zoos, but I found this underwhelming. Perhaps I should have visited the zoo in daylight."
,,"Over all, ...a very good experience",4.0,,"Wa a good experience even though I was a little sceptical because I am not a big fan of zoo, that cage animals,..but this zoo was different, and really enjoyed the bus ride through the different areas...got to see lots of the animals. The walking trails where good, was lit up well and signs everywhere to let you know what direction you where going. The show was pretty good to, wasn’t sure what to expect, again with animals coming out on stage in cages...but they didn’t they where free to roam the stage,...where a little encouraged by treats,..but all in all a really good experience."
,,Colourful night time light display,5.0,,A new installation of lights and laser displays has provided a beautiful opportunity to walk through the gardens. Some interactive light displays are good for children and adults as well. The tram ride past a range of animals was informative and very popular with local and overseas visitors.
,,It was a wild night!,5.0,,The experience was awesome! My kids enjoyed it a lot especially some new animals that was added like rhino & elephant
,,Different,4.0,,"Did this trip as it seemed different to normal trips. We really enjoyed it. Only downside is that the low light, and moving vehicle, means it’s tricky to get decent photos. Sadly didn’t get to do any walks.

If you want to try this go for one of the organised tours as you get to jump the queues, and can add a meal.

In case you’re worried the tram is just a road train and there is only one trip so no chopping and changing"
,,Overrated,1.0,,I’ve been to many zoos around the world and this was one experienced to be missed. It was promoted as a chance to see the nocturnal animals in their natural habitat but the few that were visible in the dim light could have been seen more easily during the day. It seemed to be more of an exercise in relieving you of your money.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A must do if visiting Singapore. Arrive early to see the fire dancers! The first time slot is the busiest. Suggest a later slot and walk the tracks first. Finish with the tram, it will be less crowded. If you dont walk the tracks you miss heaps, but the tram is great. Highly recommended."
,,Recommend booking on a Tour,5.0,,"Great visit, number one tip would be to book on a tour through a company so that you can get priority access and direct entry onto the train that takes you around the zoo on a 40+ minute trip. My reasoning is the queues can be horrendous at times (they are very well managed but the thought of queuing for an hour doesn’t appeal).

Tip two: good walking shoes and even though it’s night, it’s pretty warm so be prepared for it and wear appropriate clothing.

Throughly enjoyed and would highly recommend."
,,Not as impressive as Chimelong Panyu China,1.0,,"Compare with Chimelong Panyu China, It is not at all impressive. The money paid for and the total experience felt so cheated. Will not recommend to friends from overseas."
,,If in Singapore have to visit at least once,5.0,,Highly recommend tour if you are visiting Singapore. Get to visit/watch nocturnal animal in their natural habitat. Not to miss the animal show.
,,Nice trip,5.0,,It was fantastic experience to visit wild animals at the night light. I would suggest ppl to take a tram for half a distance and walk for the remaining. So that can have a thrilled night walk.
,,High expectations,3.0,,"This was an okay experience, we didn’t think it lived up to the hype. But if you haven’t been to many Zoo experiences, then you would probably find this excellent.

We have recently been to Toronga Zoo (Sydney) and Australia Zoo (Queensland) and perhaps that raised our expectations too high.

A reasonably long wait in line for the tram, and then it didn’t actually stop at any of the exhibits! While it was driving slowly, you only got a couple of seconds to look at the animals.

One great thing was how close to the animals you are.

Next time, we would make sure we had enough time to do the safari walk and then go on the tram later.

The creatures of the night show was good (the host was excellent) but the animals were a bit underwhelming (again, compared to Australia Zoo).

Purchase tickets online for a discount."
,,Really good visit,4.0,,This was really good. However it is very crowded outside the entrance and there is a lot of pushing and shoving. The fire show was difficult to see in the crowds. I would recommend going to creatures of the night show first then doing walking trails then going on the tram. I would also start with the wallaby walk because the crowds go the other way round. The walks were good. Staff are on hand so you cannot wander off the paths.There is low lighting so take care. It is difficult to see some of the animals but if you take the time and let your eyes adjust you can see most of them. The bats fly straight towards you in the bat walk through so he aware of this if it makes you uneasy.The tram was really good and stopped at key points of interest. You get really close to the animals. Staff were really good and helpful. Plenty of taxis waiting outside.
,,Night Safari is a fantastic experience,5.0,,"The Night safari is a wonderful way of seeing the animals in a night setting. The entire experience is truly amazing. the train is also a great way of transportation, the commentary by the guide is entertaining. This is a must for children of all ages if you are travelling with them. They will be fascinated by the tour."
,,Average experience,3.0,,"Visited on a Tuesday off peak weeknight with the family.

Commenting solely on the night safari animals, there were a reasonable number of different animals for viewing, carnivores and herbivores etc, in the dark in a ‘not so’ natural habitat (which makes tram ride viewing possible). There were also a few no shows.

The creatures of the night presentation was entertaining with some interaction with the audience, but we’ve seen better.

That’s about where the positives end. The queue for the tram was more than double the duration of the ride. Imagine what it would be like during peak periods. Unfortunately I’d imagine this is not an issue with an easy solution. Some patrons within the tram were yelling out and chattering loudly amongst themselves making it difficult to hear the recorded commentary and disturbing the overall experience, and probably the animals as well. Although there were signs stating not to be loud during the ride, perhaps more direct and strict emphasis by park staff should be made prior to setting off.

Although we were told the Night Safari was one of the must do activities when visiting Singapore, I would leave it up to friends to decide if they would visit rather than definitely recommending it to them."
,,Good experience,3.0,,"The tram ride was good.it takes about 45 minutes.we can see the nocturnal animals in their natural settings.we can also walk through each trial.but we felt that quite tiring since we visited the zoo and the river safari the same day.zoo,river safari and night safari are right next to each other.so can be covered in a day."
,,Amazing night!!,5.0,,"I had read other reviews (equal mix of good & bad) and came to this evening with the realistic expectation that we just might not be lucky on the night to see much because animals can be unpredictable but it was truly fantastic! We were in the first entry period at 7pm and straight to the tram ride queue so that we were on the 2nd or 3rd tram - it was just dark. We were extremely lucky to see EVERY animal active and within reasonable distance. We enjoyed the tram ride & we loved wandering the trails in the moonlight too - really different experience to see the animals in an evening environment, even managed to catch some feedings (hippos & rhinos!!). Didn't bother with the shows too crowded, but managed to catch the fire show in the queue waiting for entry which was short but entertaining. Overall a fantastic night, not overly busy, we went on a Thursday, don't forget bugspray!! Didn't leave until after 11pm, taxis plentiful for return to city."
,,Very disappointed,2.0,,Almost all animals are sleeping while we are on tram ride. It makes us wonder are those actually real animals or just some kind of fake items. When on fishing cat trial，no cat，no mouse deer，nothing at all。。。and the show？ never have time to watch as the queue for the tram too too long。。Not worth it。
,,Overrated and expensive ticket prices,3.0,,"Not many animals and mostly were inactive. The animal show was hardly interesting . More like a talk show. To me, it was a waste of time watching the show."
,,First time in a night safari,5.0,,"Pre-book ticket online doesn’t mean that you have seat for the selected 7:15 tour for example. However we arrived to the zoo 1 hour before the start it was told that our trip is full, so had to wait 2 hours, hmmmm. That is a bit under organized, specifically if you are with young children and you are after a long day. You should relax before the night safari. Took the train (tram) trip, which was therefore comfortable. Nice, good experience and hope will save some animals from the ticket price. Unfortunately can’t make pictures with mobile phone because of the dark. You need a pro camera. Recommend"
,,Great,5.0,,"Great attraction! Not all animals were availble pr out for viewing which was a tad disppointing. Loved the tram ride, were available regularly with 20-30min cues. Very tidy venue! Highly recommend this adventure."
,,Unique and wonderful experience,4.0,,"It is a very unique and wonderful experience. Yes, Q is long but should be able to board within 30 mins. As it is at night, weather is cooling and comfortable (compare to day). Highlight of the ride was seeing lion, elephant and a very active tiger.

One thing that Night Safari should do is to replace all diesel tram to electric tram which is more environmental friendly, quieter and without the smelly fume."
,,Very good attraction. Very confusing website.,4.0,,"The website definitely needs more work. It was not at all clear to us what is included, not included, etc. At the top of the website is a huge advertisement for a ParkHopper pass for OTHER parks. Interesting, but confusing when what I want is information about THIS park! Scrolling down, it is not clear that the ticket includes 3 different things - the tram ride, the 'creatures of the night' show, and the walking trails. It is also not clear that when you purchase a ticket that this is the time you can ENTER the park, NOT the time of the tram ride. As a result, we almost missed the other parts of the park.Once inside, the attraction is excellent, but PLEASE clean up the website. Make it clear what is included, and lose the advertisements for other parks that just confuse people."
,,Nice Thing to see,4.0,,"Huge demand on this safari, you get to see a lot of nice animals over the trip, but it is not literally a safari it is a bus ride through the Zoo at night, but still very enjoyable especially for kids."
,,Night Safari Singapore,3.0,,"If you want to see animals in open during the night then you can visit, however there is long waiting in ques. its better to see all the shows first then take the tram to see the zoo."
,,A highlight of our trip to Singapore,5.0,,"Very enjoyable way to see the zoo and avoid the daytime heat and humidity. Bonus, the animals are more active at night anyhow. Nearly every animal offered was active on our trip. One negative is you won't be able to take much in the way of photographs without appropriate equipment"
,,A different kind of zoo experience...,5.0,,"A great way to see the animals at night. Book online and get an eticket, much easier. Have dinner before you go, food is expensive and not so appetising. We saw the shows first, then took the tram ride and chose the trails to walk. It is popular with many tourists on buses."
,,Good fun,4.0,,"Didn't appreciate the show much, bought tickets online and would have love a map and more explanation on how it works. Wonderful to see the animals at night. Would have liked to stay longer."
,,Night safari on a Friday night!!!,3.0,,"The safari itself is quite ok however the queue to get on the teams was over an hour, with a pregnant Wife and two small kids it really was not worth the hassle. We were lucky as it was clear other people would have to wait even longer"
,,Awesome!!,5.0,,It was the first time in my 28 years of living in this world that I visited the night safari and it was my lovely and wonderful girlfriend who brought me there! Was really excited even before stepping into the park and everything was way beyond my expectations of that place. Sad thing is that we didn’t manage to visit all the animals due to time constraints but will be definitely heading back to visit very soon! :)
,,Not brilliant but not bad at all,4.0,,"My wife and I were doubting if this was something we wanted to do because of the mixed reviews. Some people said it was only 30 min and disappointing and some people said it was the best ever. It was a good experience for us but you have to do the tram and then walk around to get the best of it. You get to see the fruit bat and flying squirrel in very nice enclosures and very close and in general it is very well organized. Some annoying people don´t understand you should never use flash with night animals but that is what it is, there is weird people everywhere. The only negative point may be the fact that there is big cats in very small enclosures and that is never good to see."
,,Very busy,4.0,,"Saturday evening visit, was super busy but great experience altogether! Great jungle settings for night time."
,,Child friendly,5.0,,my toddler 2.5 year old really enjoyed it! the show was really entertaining and fun. highly recommended for family with young children
,,Good,3.0,,"Not bad but overall still ok..mostly same with last few years.If you interested with adventure, can consider this activity ;)"
,,Night Safari Singapore Zoo,3.0,,Lots of hype about this tour but was below expectation as only a few animals could be seen. The night safari in Bali was far better with a lot more animals in real settings
,,Visit to Night Safari with my 4 Years Old,4.0,,"Went to Night Safari on a weekend and it was really crowded. Queued for about 45 mins to take the tram, but overall it was a good trip. Managed to see most of the animals even though it was pitch dark, very exciting trying to spot the various animal with my little one. My 4 years old was selected as one of the volunteer for the Creature of the Night show and it was a wonderful experience for her to have a close encounter with a binturong. Educational, as we went for the Keepers Chit Chat for Lion and she learned and remember some facts mentioned during the session. Memorable trip for the little one and would look forward to visit night safari again in the near future."
,,Night safari Experience,4.0,,A wonderful way at looking the wildlife and their nocturnal habits. Of course the queue were very long and disturbs the animals with regular tram loads of tourists intruding their peace.
,,A mysterious experience !,4.0,,"The Animals are so close, as if their breathing could be heard in the silence. It was a nice and relaxing time"
,,Nice visit,5.0,,Their service is good. The place is clean and have a lot of staff will guide you if you are not aware where to go.
,,Good experience but preferred day zoo,3.0,,"Was really excited to go on the night safari. Booked day zoo and night safari package. Sorry but the day zoo was much better in my opinion.
Booked the 8.15 tram and arrived to a massive queue. It is just an indication of time and a method to control numbers. So took the animal show which has fun then for the tram ride for the 40mins. It is well worth the tram ride versus walking around the zoo. After the tram we walked a bit but many animals are asleep and it was very late and hot.
Took a Grab to city as it is a 15 minute bus then MRT ride and can take almost an hour. Grab was half the cost of the advertised point to point car service at the exit/taxi area."
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,"I was with my girlfriend and we were amazed by the night safari. We saw all kind of animals, white lions, hienas, rhinos and many more. Nice ride with the tram and them a very nice walk. I liked the most the fruit eating bats which were really close to us. I would definetely recomend this to anyone who is going to Singapore"
,,Fabulous and unique family night out!,4.0,,We had a fantastic night at the safari. Our girls love the experience of going to see animals at night and we all thoroughly enjoying the open air tram experience. We also had the opportunity to see the fire show which was amazing to watch. Overall we enjoyed a fabulous and unique night out!
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We found the night safari at the zoo worth the travel. We booked the tram for the first slot and went straight to the queue. We had seen bad reviews due to queuing times but this didn't happen while we were there. Saw lots of nocturnal animal which was lovely. After the ride round we went to see the animal show which was cute. We didn't walk round or watch the fire show simply because we were tired from a busy day but this would also have been good. We did get pushed and shoved a bit coming out but this is due to rude tourists not the zoo. We recommend this for all age groups.
,,Very good - but a bit of trek out of town,4.0,,"We booked this online through Trip Advisor (RMG Tours) before we arrived in Singapore to ensure we had a space plus hassle free pick-up from Hotel. We were picked up bang on time at 18:15 but what they then do is take you to the Gardens in the Bay terminus to consolidate the various trip options on to a second set of coaches, which took 30 minutes. It then takes a further 30-40 minutes depending on traffic to get to the Night Safari Zoo. The guide gets to pass the tram queues and onto the next available tram which takes you around the zoo after which you get about an hour free time to walk around and/or have a meal or drink. By 9pm the number of visitors is thinning out and as the zoo is open until 12 midnight if I visited again I think I would arrive at 9pm. Tram ride was quite good as the animals mostly seemed to be within view – but we most enjoyed the walk about when we were lucky to see a keeper doing a talk about the wallabies, actually see the elusive fishing cat. You can get to the Zoo on the Hippo Tourist Bus, Public Transport or a taxi. We paid a total of about £40 each (so you are only paying about an extra £15 for coach pick-up, transfers to zoo, guide and queue jumping so well worth the extra)."
,,Active animals that you never see!,5.0,,It’s a bit tricky understanding how it all works but it was amazing if you love animals in the wild. They have a show with the animals that left my mouth on the floor how they got the animals to do the things they did! Truly amazing. They have the tram to see it all and it’s worth every penny!
,,Night Safari Singapore Zoo,3.0,,Not worth it. You only get to right on a tram without seeing the animal up close. You can book your transpo with Grab than taking the bus to Singapore Zoo. Less hassle.
,,Great night out,5.0,,"We’re a family of 4 with two young children 4 and 2. We unknowingly purchased a private tour which was really good, pricey, but really good. It was private and fully escorted. The guide was very knowledgeable and answered any questions we asked.
The private tour allowed us an amazing elephant experience where we could feed the elephants.
The 2 ur old was asleep at the end and the 4 yr old was a bit over it by the end, but Mum and Dad enjoyed it!

There are heaps of options for dinner at the night safari and taxis are readily available and cheap ($S30) to get back to downtown.

A good night out but would advise to splurge on the private tour, we saw the bus go past with everyone on it and it ripped past pretty quickly."
,,This is terrific,5.0,,"If you want to experience something a bit different night safari at the zoo is a good option. The animal show is good, showing animal behavior at dusk and night.
The tram ride in the dark through the zoo and in the open areas where mainly deer graze and past other nocturnal animals is very exciting.
As in the day time there are plenty to see and do and wherever you go there is food to buy.
I can certainly recommend it."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Highly recommend the night safari as a must see in Singapore. You get a very different view and feel for the animals at night. The tram ride takes you on a quick tour of the zoo but I found that walking the trails was more interesting as you get to see more and can take your time viewing animals that are of more interest to you.
,,Did not disappoint,4.0,,"The night safari is great... it engaged our child and the balance of the walking trails and the tram are great. We walked for about an hour and then caught the tram when he was starting to fade...

Tip - don’t rush to do the tram... the queues are only there for the main intake times (- but move quickly) go for a walk and then jump on the tram..."
,,Night Safari was One of the Best Experiences Ever,5.0,,"We decided to book the Night Safari which turned out to be one of the best experiences ever. Getting so close to animals such as Lions, Tigers, Elephants, Rhinos, Etc..."
,,Very Atmospheric,4.0,,"We found the Night Safari a lot easier than lots of stories (and the night safari website) implies.

Went on a Thursday evening, when there weren’t too many crowds. Got there by MRT and the shuttle bus - very easy. Got there for entry at 7:15, and went to the first show. That was OK but not stunning.

Then did the tram ride which helped orientate us with what was out there. Loved the elephant exhibit, which showcased them in great majesty.

We then walked round the park, taking till 10:30 to do so, at which point we caught the shuttle bus back.

Walking round enabled us to spend time where we wanted to - hyenas were fun, we always enjoy bats and the large fruit bats didn’t disappoint, saw the tiger from close quarters etc. What comes across is the feeling of being a fly on the wall of these animals as they go about their business.

Can’t believe how many people cannot understand the instructions on the tram: “no flash” - multiple people on our tram car took flash shots throughout the tour, and just ignored all instructions from the driver not to do so.

Would suggest to take water / drink with you and not waste time in the food and beverage locations.

Probably wouldn’t go back and repeat, but it is a lovely memory."
,,A Unique Experience,3.0,,"The Tram Ride through the park is very good. If it’s the only thing to do, I’d give it a 4+.
If you have the time, do the night walk thought the park. That should be excellent.
The show is, well, hokey at best. However, kids will really enjoy it. It only gets a 3+.
We ate dinner in the park, which I would not recommend. I’d rate the dinner at a 2.5.
All in all, it is a unique experience, not likely to be repeated elsewhere."
,,Decent evening out,4.0,,"Tram ride was fun, incredible to see elephants and lions up close and not behind screens! Wallaby pen was fun, they run about you! Was good to get out the city for a bit and you feel that here. Reasonably priced provided you book your tickets on secondary sites. Cost $30 sgd in a taxi from Robertson Quay."
,,Nothing to see much,1.0,,I would say a pure waste of money. First of all in night safari tour you barely see animals in night as it’s all dark. Whatever the show you out of which 90% are different species of Deer. The tour finishes in like 30 minutes and you keep on thinking why you spend so much money on it.Even the worst zoo in India is lit better than the counterpart in Singapore.You really don’t want to pay to see buffalo in a zoo when the roam around the streets in India.I really don’t understand how it’s good for wildlife when there is a constant vehicles moving through their habitat carrying lots of tourist and the guide announcing about the animals in a speaker while they are trying to sleep.
,,Boring and nothing to see,1.0,,"The train ride was very boring. The park should be beautiful, but you can't see it at night. The animals are mostly hardly to be recognized. Better go to the park during the day."
,,Tickets for zoo bought via viator,1.0,,I bought tickets for zoo safari via tripadvisor and viator over a week ago As yet I have no pickup time or place for trip tomorrow night Tried to cancel or rearrange well outwith 24hr period stated. and cannot do this Phoned tour operators multiple times today and emailed no replies So I do not know if the trip is happening or not Was told I would be instructed of these essential details after booking Feel very let down by whole experience This was to be one of our most anticipated tours
,,Animals of the night,5.0,,"Had an amazing evening at the night Safari, got up close with some amazing creatures. Experience we have never done before. Highly recommend"
,,A must to do,5.0,,"This is a must to donor you are in Singapore, just a 30 minutes away from sentosa by taxi and you will have a great experience a lot of nice animals and shows you should not miss"
,,Electric tram?,3.0,,"The whole experience was wonderful, although I think the tram could be solar charged electric one?
During the whole tour I was disturbed by the engine sound and the smell of gasoline.
They talked about protecting the nature and the animals, so I see why not switching the tour vehicle to something more ecological. It would be more quiet, which is less stress for the animals as well. The guide could be also done by headphones to keep the silence for them, for those who would like to hear the guide can plug the headphones in.
Maybe they already have been talking about the idea...but because as much as I love the place, thought its a pity the experience with the trams.
Nonetheless I think the concept is wonderful!"
,,Over hyped.,3.0,,"Large crowds, over priced food, extremely hot and problems with the tram. The creatures of the night, was nice, as the commentator was engaging. We waited over 45 mins to get on the tram. There was a problem, which they never bothered to notify us until the problem had been fixed. Seeing the animals at night was ok, but probably wouldn’t do it again. Sorry."
,,Unique Experience,3.0,,Well organised unique experience. The concept was appealing however during the visit whilst we did see a few animals it felt a little too rushed on the vehicle and therefore not really getting to enjoy the animals you did see. We did however thoroughly enjoy our visit and well worth a visit. Definitely recommend the evening show the presenter was fantastic and had an amazing sense of humour. Wish I could remember her name.
,,Brilliant memorable place,4.0,,Visited as part of honeymoon trip and was a visit to remember. The park is amazing with animals in what seems to be as natural habitat as you can for captivity. No barriers apart from when really needed eg tigers and leopards. Tip may be if getting there when opens don’t go straight to the tour karts after show as will be queuing and maybe walk the trail first if want to. A definite place to visit.
,,Vacation,4.0,,"Hey guyz, visited ghe night safari today and it was good fun. My dad needed a wheel chair and it was available and no additional charges for it. The staff was superb , friendly. The safari wae amazing and also the show followee by it. Hsd dinner there itself in the indian restaurant. The food was good too. Visited the place after nearly 8 yrs. Had a great time !"
,,Fantastic visit,5.0,,"One of the best things to do on a visit to Singapore. Very well run, great facilities. And brilliant and passionate staff to give you a great experience. And the animals, they appear to be very contented and well looked after."
,,Night Safari with young children,4.0,,"The night safari was easy on weekday, with minimum crowd, we were allowed early entry with minimum hestitation. The ride was smooth and the sufficient to allow the young children a good view of the animals at each station."
,,Not A Must But Still Very Enjoyable,4.0,,The whole experience is very well run. The park is massive with lots to see but because of the size it’s very difficult to see things clearly.The animal show was a lot of fun and this too is included in your ticket. Didn’t try the food but it all looked good.
,,The animals,3.0,,"Overall is good ,some of the animals are asleep and can’t be seen.the animal show is great.Hope to see more animals in the future"
,,Good but previous times better,4.0,,Went with my wife and 2 young boys in September. Been here before couple of times. This time round can’t really see most animals. Doubt they were hiding. Probably it was a low season for them so maintenance and upkeep of the place was more a priority and the animals were taken for care.
,,Good but not Great,4.0,,"Found it difficult to hear the commentary. Also, no matter how many times we were told ""NO FLASH"" there was some Chinese clown thinking it was a press conference."
,,a different experience from the zoo in day time,4.0,,It's fun and interesting. my kid enjoyed spotting the animals in the dark. It's worth visiting after the zoo as it provides a different experience walking the paths in the night.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"It was raining, recommendation to put shelter for the animal show. we have to run to take cover for shelter."
,,Beautiful and mysterious,4.0,,"I had a good experience at the Night Safari. I arrived about 6:30pm and it was perfect timing as the hot sun was disappearing. To get here by public transport I took the MRT to Ang Mo Koi-on the North/South Line- then took bus 138 to the Night safari- the ride on the bus took about 20 minutes, but don’t worry the safari/zoo is the last stop- so you won’t miss it.

There was a Creatures of the Night Show at 7.15 I saw that ga e a nice introduction to the park and what we were going to see.

I then took a tram ride through the park- it was beautiful and relaxing- some of the animals in the free range area, came very close to the tram to say ‘Hello’. The tram ride lasted for about 30-40 minutes with information given about the animals and conservation.

If you didn’t get your fill of animals, you could also do 4 walks through the jungle to see the animals a bit more closely.

There are a lot of food stalls, restaurants and souvenir shops scattered throughout the park."
,,Wasted,3.0,,"Went there around 7.15pm and took the train by the time we finished is around 8pm. Can't make it to watch the night show, need to wait till 9pm++ Gentle advise : watch the show first before take the train !"
,,Skip-the-Line: Priority Tram Boarding at Night Safari with Buffet Dinner,2.0,,"So this is a review with three parts:
1: The night Safari
2: The zoo restaurant
3: Viator and Tour East - Singapore who offer the specific tour

1. The Night Safari
This was excellent and definitely worth doing. I would recommend to forget dinner and more fully explore the zoo. Really this is not a sight to miss. So 9/10 for this part only

2. The Zoo Restaurant
This was okay. A little over priced but the food was good and the range was excellent. Unless you have plenty of time I would skip eating here and more fully explore the Restaurant. So 6/10 alone.

3. Viator and Tour East - Singapore who offer the specific tour
Really this part was a shocker!! We were picked up early from our motel, only to be dropped in china town to wait then change buses to wait again before heading towards the zoo. Well we lost an hour in this fiasco. Then when we arrived we were shuffled to the Restaurant for another hour. Then shuffled to a holding yard to wait again and then another holding pen to wait again before boarding the tram.
The tram ride was awesome (see above) but then we had lost too much time we couldn’t see the live animal show but we were taken for a ‘trail walk’. Some eight minutes into the trail walk, our guide decided that we didn’t have time to complete it so turned around and went back to the entrance saying “just look at the shops for 20 minuets”. So given the very poor logistics we got to see less than a third of the zoo and only one show of two. This wouldn’t be as bad if the advertising didn’t say “Use your skip-the-line pass to the Night Safari tram for priority boarding, and spend your 4 hours exploring the nighttime rainforest rather than waiting in line”. Sorry we got less than two hours to ‘explore the zoo’ and although the zoo was great the tour was embarrassingly poorly organised. I would rate them 1/10 (at least we didn’t get lost).

If you’re going to the night Safari find another way and eat before you go . . ."
,,Fantastic Evening with the animals,5.0,,Our second trip to do this fantastic safari with the animals. Superb opportunity to view animals how they should be cared and nurtured in a realistic and sympathetic environment. Well done Singapore Zoo for providing a spectacle seen nowhere else.
,,Night safari review,3.0,,"My partner and I and her sister and her partner came to the night safari the day after going to the zoo... I preferred the zoo at night as the main animals come to life at night, so there’s a bit more action going on.

Now to the nitty gritty part of the experience. Firstly you have to book a time you want to attend but I really think that doesn’t matter as it’s a mad house when you actually turn up on the night. There are massive lines to get on the trams, so you could be waiting a long time... The best thing I recommend to do is walk to the feeding as by the time you get on the tram you’ll probably miss it. So get there nice and early and go to the feedings and there’s also other shows on that we missed as they were all booked out by the time you got on the tram and back again.
So my best advice is find out the feeding times, go to those, go to the shows and then jump on the tram. All in all still a good experience."
,,All over a perfect Night Zoo experience.,5.0,,"All though we were a bit confused at the beginning, as nobody didnt take notice what kind of tickets we got"
,,Good way to get in touch with nature!,3.0,,"The guided tour is quite good, although it may be hard to hear at some times due to noisy tourists. Waiting line is minimum. There are also some good tracks to be done by foot. Some animals may be hard to be spotted."
,,Can't really see the animal at night,3.0,,"As the it is open at night, you can’t really see the animal clearly as the lighting is not very strong. Besides, so of the animal is resting at somewhere without lighting so you cannot have too high expectations that you can see many animal."
,,Nice but.....,5.0,,"Booked our trip from the hotel for around $35 each and was picked up by coach and brought to the collection point at Marina Bay area to be transported to the safari. Travel time from hotel to safari was about 1hr 15min there and back which gives you about 1hr approx I the safari. Now I love the idea of the animals and all that buy I don't think it was for me. You seem to get whizzed by in the safari jeep and it's dark and sometimes you don't see all the animals. When your finished you can take a walk around to specific animals and spend more time there and that was ok. I liked the tigers and especially the elephants. Gift shops and food areas are available and reasonably priced to my surprise, I even had a tiger beer (as you do) and it was not expensive. This is a popular attraction so book with the travel rep as the crowds are big and there is lots of people here. Suitable for kids of all ages so mums and dads will be happy. Overall a nice attraction but not for me but I did enjoy the drive up as got to see different areas on the road trip."
,,Night Safari should have been a pass,3.0,,Visited the Night Safari and faced with one long queue after another. First to collect pre-purchased tickets from self-serve vending machine (20 minutes) than the second to enter through the turnstiles (40 minutes) and the third (90 minute queue) to board the tram. We had tickets for the 8pm tram so arrived at the Safari entrance at just after 6:00pm to only board the tram at around 8:30pm. It is Singapore so it was very warm waiting in each line and felt like a conveyor of people. Appreciate it is a popular attraction however it all felt very staged once inside and seated on the tram with the animal enclosure viewing. There are also night walks you can do down to see the animals once you have disembarked from the tram however at that late hour and with a young child they start to feel tired and not so keen on the 40 minute round trip walk time to view the animals. Suggest if you have young children that there are better options for an animal attraction experience.
,,Night Zoo,5.0,,"The Night Zoo is also called the Night Safari. When you get to the Zoo, first take the walking tour so the Tram line will decrease. I do recommend the walking tour, it was fun to be alone in the dark hearing lions roar and hyenas laugh. But we weren't super impressed with the walking tour. Then we took the tram ride and were REALLY impressed. If you bought Hop On Hop Off ticket, the bus ride to and from the Zoo are included in your ticket price and you really should take this as the Zoo is VERY VERY VERY (at least an hour) far from downtown. If you take the Hop On Hop Off you will be limited on time, so first take the walking tour so the Tram line will decrease. Once you are on the tram, it's a 45 minute tour (and it's excellent)."
,,Great for kids,4.0,,We arrived at the zoo at 7pm (opens at 7:30) and there was already a lot of people there. We did the tram first (the queues are long but it moves fast). It’s hard to take photos at night as you aren’t allowed to use a flash so if you can get on one of the first trams it would be best. There are a few walking trails where you get to see the animals up close. They also do a live show. This Zoo is about 40 mins outside the city. We caught the MRT to Khatib and then caught the Shuttle to the Zoo. Very good for kids.
,,Best night zoo in the world,5.0,,Best night zoo in the world. The animal show is truely amazing and a must go . The zoo is well maintained
,,Nice place to relax if you are still in the wrong timezone.,5.0,,"Slightly dated overcrowded and bit stinky of tram exhaust.

However, it's still very enjoyable despite the smelly diesel pumping vehicles that remind me of tractors. I think it's about time for Singapore to invest in some silent electric trams.

Plenty of animals to see but feels like its a bit less organised and fewer animals than I remembered. I might suggest walking first and riding trams later. Whole families pushed into the front under the ropes to jump the queue."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"This would be my second time at night safari. It was definitely a good one. I noticed there were a lot of deers (different types). Perhaps, can add other type of animals that are not deers."
,,Encounter with wild animals,4.0,,Night safari is something which can be explored in the night. Animals can be seen from a distance . It's an amazing tourist activity for animals lovers and definately for kids
,,Can take it or leave it,3.0,,"Crowds were ridiculous, even though the staff organised it as well as they could. There were queues everywhere- to go in, to watch the show, to wait for the tram.
Not sure if it was a special day or not but there were also lots of tour groups too.

Unfortunately the show was cancelled because of light rain. We saw quite a few animals on the tram ride and some were quite close.

We added the Night Safari after finishing Singapore Zoo- both were different but I wouldn’t recommend going out of your way for the Night Safari. Food options in the entrance area were pretty terrible- would recommend just sticking to KFC etc near the zoo entrance."
,,Must see!,5.0,,Great experience. Efficient service. The entire experience was memorable. The best is tram journey was so close to nature. You can literally touch the amount (but don't ever try!).
,,A journey into the nocturnal world,4.0,,"The Night Safari offers a different and unique experience from all other 3 parks (Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park) in the sense that you're exploring the nocturnal world and seeing more exotic animals with names that most people don't really know unless you're passionate about wildlife.

Coming from a Singaporean's perspective and experience, the Night Safari is mostly visited by large tourist groups which is something you'll hardly see at the other parks, and one of the things that they usually do is head for the tram safari ride, which explains why other tourists complain of long waiting hours.

What I usually do is head for either the walking trails or catch the ""Creatures of the Night"" show first, and wait for the tourist groups to leave the park after they'd finished with the tram safari ride and shows.

It's not really a must to catch the tram safari ride first because when I take the tram after most of the tour groups are gone, you will realise how little people there are queuing for the tram and you'll get to enjoy it in peace, because tour groups are notoriously noisy.

Don't expect to see a lot of animals along the tram safari route, because they're animals after all, and while I heard people complaining about the dim lighting, do note that it's been specially designed to mimic moonlight, hence adding to the theme of a nocturnal world, from my point of view, and won't affect the animals as much.

All in all, the Night Safari offers a truly unique experience that you won't get elsewhere in the world and a little trick about making the most out of the whole experience is to not follow the ""rat race""."
,,Night Safari is a different way to experience the animal kingdom from a typical zoo,5.0,,"Arrived 15 minutes before entry time and you will enjoy the spectacular fire show! Then do take note of the Creatures of the Night performance timing cos you do not want to miss that! After which is the tram ride, then you can plan where to walk (if you wish to walk around some more)."
,,Night life,4.0,,"Great food, great attractions. Great company to end the night on a high. Would definitely recommend it"
,,Night Safari,2.0,,"Nothing much to see when going round in the tram. There were 2 shows during weekdays and if you missed the first one, it will be a mad rush to queue up for the second one and the show has changed to not so interesting now. Not a good experience for me"
,,Singapore Zoo day and night,5.0,,"We went to the Night Zoo in Singapore, well worth doing. You will see the nocternal animals moving about under the cover of darkness. It is dark and you will only see outlines at first but your eyes do adjust well. Many families and children around. You will need to wait for some time in a queue before you go onto a open sided bus that takes you around on a tour. You can also walk around in the dark and take your time and wait for animals to appear. Lighting works well so you can see where you are going.

Bad cats of Brissy"
,,Excellent Exprience,5.0,,"Visited after the rain, the ambience at the rain forest was nice and cool. The tram ride was smooth and the staff gave very brief and precious explanation of the animals. Live it!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"We always go to the night zoo, because we love the nocturnal animal activities. We tried the River Experience, and would definitely rate a visit."
,,Different but exciting zoo experience,5.0,,"This is a really different zoo experience, but we really enjoyed visiting. It was great to see zoo many of the animals in a more natural night time setting, where most animals tend to be a lot more active.

We especially enjoyed the different otters playing around at dusk and a lot more active crocs than normal.

A few recommendations - Wait for the tram rides until the first hazzle at opening has been completed. It is advisable to do all of the walks, which as well can be done in the beginning to avoid the huge line at the trams.

Would also recommend everyone to do both tram and all of the beautiful walks."
,,Really innovative and interesting zoo experience,5.0,,"My wife, nephew and I visited this attraction recently and I was really impressed. I was looking forward to it, but prepared to be a little disappointed - but I wasn't in the least! It's very well thought out and organised and executed. Obviously there can be no guarantees that you'll see all the animals intended, but we managed to see almost everything - it's very cleverly lit and commentated, and it's very enjoyable. The tram ride was superb, and great to then be able to explore on foot and go and see some of the animals for a closer and longer look. Well done! Very good! :)"
,,Great outing for the kids.,5.0,,The entire experience was fantastic. The tram ride along with the introduction is excellent. The children are fascinated by the free range animals and how close we can actually see them in their natural habitat.
,,Nice Zoo in a beautiful rainforest setting but not more,3.0,,"Even though it brands itself as a place where the animal's enclosures are open and naturalistic and unlike other night zoos, who reverse the day-night cycle it just lightly dims the enclosures, we were a bit disappointed. Let's face it: of course the animals still live in cages, only that they are beautifully embedded in the rainforest, so that the fences are invisible. Big trenches separate visitors from the animal in most enclosures. Also, the enclosures did not seem larger than in good modern Zoos nowadays since all animals 'presented' themselves to the passing train cars (why not electric instead of the noisy and polluting petrol ones used?) that carry the visitors. We couldn't see a lot of hiding places for them. Whether or not the animals feel stressed by the light and the masses of visitors passing by in the train cars remains unclear.But hey, it is a Zoo and also we were going there to actually see the animals and would have been disappointed to not seeing the lions.. so it remains a trade-off and a personal ethical decision as with all animal attractions.What we liked was that they provide good information about animal welfare and how to protect the species. They seem to support a lot of projects around the world to protect wildlife and make people more aware of the dangers. Of course (it is Singapore!) it is a immaculate park, super clean and well organised. Lots of food places to spend time. We would not recommend the animal though.I give it an average rating since for us it didn't fulfil our expectation of this 'open wild', rather it is a good Zoo with a theme park-like touch where you are driven through by train car instead of walking. Worth a visit to support their wildlife welfare programs and to inform your kids about how endangered some are and what we can do about it."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Excellent would do again go early so you have plenty of time to walk around and do the tram tour + creatures of the night show.
,,Dispointed,2.0,,Singapore Zoo is much much better than night safari.. wasted paying fees for night safari which is more expensive than zoo.. 🙄
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Highly recommend. The set up was great, enjoyed the tram ride and the animals looked happy and healthy.Only let down was the food we had, it wasn't very nice. Only went to one outlet so the other food may have been okay"
,,Don’t miss it,4.0,,Very nice place to visit and enjoy your time Suitable for families and also single travelers Quality show and many types of animals and many shows
,,A unique Singapore experience,5.0,,This is certainly on the must do list for people who like zoo visits. Its very well set up and has plenty to keep all ages interested. Its also cooler at night than during the day. Ge there early and perhaps have a meal at the zoo before entering.
,,Not Worth for Money,3.0,,"By comparing with Singapore Zoo, night safari ticket seems a lot expensive. I am not sure izit because the higher maintenance cost. Seems like Singapore Zoo is a lot better."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"This was a great experience. On this 40 minute you can see 100 species of animals. Tigers, lions, elephants and lots other animals."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"Total getaway from the urban concrete jungle and hide out. When we were there,we forgot we were in a city and just complete feeling of staying in a forest jungle... what missing was the camp fire and a conga and a guitar. Unique experience out of suddenly thrown into a rainforest in a metropolitan city with concrete buildings and highways cover every inch."
,,Good but not must,3.0,,While night Safari is a different experience but not a must activity. U hardly get to see any animals. Cover Singapore zoo instead
,,Fantastic and a must visit,4.0,,"I had second thoughts while going through some of the negative reviews as we were really planning it the way they had.: after a long day at zoo and river safari!!
However I must say it was really the highlight of the entire day. A can't be ignored attractions. We could even see the animals that we couldn't during the day. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,Special Safari,5.0,,"If you are traveling with kids, they would for sure enjoy this place. It has so many things, the fire show, the bird show, the trail walk and then the safari tour. It will easily take 2-3 hours to cover all and you really get a feel of being in jungle in night. Its bit far off from the city, so plan your travel accordingly. Cabs are easily available."
,,My son love it but...,4.0,,Took my son to the safari because I have promised him so for a long time. He really looking forward to the trip and kept standing up during the tram ride trying to find his favorite animals. Overall it is a wonderful experience for the family but I drop a star because I still feel that the animal should not be enclosed in captivity and should let go free.
,,Best experience ever,5.0,,As far as a zoo goes it was my best experience ever. Tram is a must as from inside the walking trails you will not be able to see all the animals. We were lucky enough to see all the cool ones up close...
,,Worth It!,5.0,,"My wife and I visited during the night safari. They have quite a diversity of animals. Most people took the tram, but I recommend waling. That way, you can see the animals better and the zoo doesn't feel overly crowded."
,,An interesting evening zoo visit with the buffet meal option !,4.0,,We booked our trip through Trip Advisor and everything worked as expected. Communication was prompt and easily understood and the tour company arrived on time for our hotel pickup. Tour leader provided good information before we reached the Zoo. The buffet meal was very good value and plenty of choices and time allowed was adequate before the tram tour of the Zoo commenced. Despite the forecast we enjoyed a warm humid evening at the Zoo. The commentary gave plenty of warning of what to look for on the tram ride and the animals seemed to be waiting for our visit with only a couple of exceptions. The final event of the evening was the “ The creatures of the Night” show which was a fun occasion involving staff and volunteers from the crowd. All in all a good evening with return to our hotel by 10.45pm.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,crowded but good experience! The tour guide in our tram was really passionate explaining and showing us the animals!
,,Great night out,5.0,,"Even though it rained, everything was organised to get us on the tram. Creatures of the night show was amazing"
,,Great experience,4.0,,You can not miss the night safari if you stay in Singapore! Great experience with trails you can also do to visit more and see more animals
,,Good,3.0,,Didn’t manage to see all the animals and some of them were sleeping... but still a good attraction for family.
,,Love this more than the rainforest,5.0,,It's really cool to see real live nocturnal animals up close. A very memorable experience. Wish the tram ride was longer though.
,,Great family outing!,4.0,,My kids loved the train ride and the Creatures of the Night show. They went for repeated rides. Suggestion- food is expensive. Have more cheaper food options.
,,Make sure you do both walking trails and tram,4.0,,"When you arrive, don't go straight to the night safari. Go to the ticket office at the zoo first, otherwise you'll just be trekking back there like we did. Please put a note up about this Singapore zoo, everyone except those on group packages is doing the same thing!
Once you get in, I highly recommend walking all of the trails first. You will see different animals than on the tram ride. Then go and take the tram ride. We enjoyed the experience. I've been there 20 years ago and thought the WOW factor was bigger then but it's still a wonderful night out in Singapore in my opinion."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"We did the night safari and can only recommend it! The night animal show was AWESOME!! It is included in the price and you must see it.
The Zoo has a great trail concept.. it seems as if you'd be walking in the jungle.. really neat!"
,,Lovely Intro to Singapore for us,5.0,,We did this on the first day we arrived in Singapore. Though the weather was a little humid but we enjoyed the safari a lot. We couldn't get any decent photo since flash was not permitted but it was truly a feast for the eyes. The live show at the end was a treat to watch esp for our young one who wanted to go and play with the Cobra on stage.
,,Tourist Trap - Rip-Off,1.0,,"Havaing fallen victim to clever marketing my wife and daughter decided to join the Night Safari in Singapore's zoo. Taxi driver already warned us more or less clearly that this might be disappointing.

The journey to and from the zoo was the most exciting event of the night.
Do note that from the city centre the zoo is on quite the opposite side if Singaporelah.

It was indeed! instead of 45 minutes the tookea mere 30 minutes and only very few animals were to be seen.

A Rip-Off, nothing more to be added."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Visited Singapore for 4 nights in August 2018 and one of things that is recommend is the night safari. I must say I extremely enjoyed it, it's a bit pricey and ques can be long but it's worth the wait in my opinion for the 20min cart journey. Only annoying thing is that it's so hard to get any sort of a decent photo as you aren't allowed to use flash which is understandable."
,,One time worth a visit,4.0,,Amazing mainatainece of the zoo and the animals. There are huge variety of asian animals visit ones is worth it. Loved the rhino and hippo and the indian elephant. The mini train they take you in is cool. Lovely park. The show at the end is the stealer. Superb show in the end.
,,Night safari an unforgettable experience,4.0,,"Post covering zoo we opted out for night safari and without any regret we enjoyed every bit of it.. v had taken very first slot of the safari which is at 7.15 in the evening as later it gets too much crowded.. u sit in the tram and they take u inside the zoo where u will encounter all the nocturnal animals freely.. b it deer, Neel gai, ant eater, lion too from a distance roaming free, elephants , cheetah in a glass room can be seen from a near distance , near etc.. it’s a new and amazing experience to b with the wild and witness some amazing moments .. it’s really worth going if u like safaris.. it takes about 30-40 minutes for entire ride.. u also have a English guide speaking guide who will give u details about animals and try to spot it for u.. once u r done with night safari don’t forget to see creatures of the night show along with fire show which are worth watching .."
,,magical!!,5.0,,"it is so great to see animals at such near closeness. a great way to spend a few hours. the children will definitely love it. the shows were great. however, the only down part is the long queue."
,,Great experience.,5.0,,Went with my toddler and overseas friends to have an experience. All of us enjoyed the visit especially seeing the animals roaming just beside us..
,,Short but sweet,4.0,,The tram ride was convenient and was guided by recorded descriptions of the animals we were going to see. Best experience would be to ride the middle tram. The ride was estimated to last around 40-45 mins but seemed much shorter than that. The show was also entertaining but I wished they featured more animals. :)
,,Fantastic way to spend a few hours,5.0,,Was quite expensive and worried it wouldn't be worth it but omg it was awesome. The shows were great and the main attraction for me was the English tram ride. The animals was so close to us and I was blown away. Do go to this. You are also supporting the great work they do.
,,Super!,5.0,,"Very interesting, surprisingly! Must see! Walking among animals is an unforgettable and unique experience.The only thing was the navigation; needed to concentrate all the time to be sure you are going in a right direction to visit all locations.And the transportation from the metro could be easier; they don't take cash, they take only special type of metro cards, not regular ones, however the driver allows to pay upon arrival."
,,MUST GO.,5.0,,"Don't assume this NIGHT SAFARI is going to be same as your TYPICAL zoo experience. Make sure you have enough time to walk around Night Safari as well, since bus route is different from trails!"
,,So very different,5.0,,"What a great night, Arrived and decided to walk the path, saw leopards playing around, otters and so much more, then your three tram and got to see Lions shouting at each other and wolves howling at the Moon, then home."
,,Unique Experience at Night Safari,5.0,,"Brought an Australian friend to Night Safari. We enjoyed the whole evening. We took the tram ride, walked the four theme enclosures and watched the Night Animals show. Good and excellent service! Keep it up!"
,,"Too Dark, Cannot See Animals",1.0,,"The lighting is way too dim. 80% of the time, the animals cannot be seen, either due to the lighting or due to them hiding. For the 20% of the time that they can be seen, they cannot be seen clearly. Due to the dim lighting, colors are all washed up.The animal show is hard to catch because the seats get filled up too quickly. You have to queue up at least half an hour before in order to get a seat. They should expand the area to allow for a bigger audience.Overall, a poor experience, especially if we consider the high entrance fee. The daytime zoo is 10x better."
,,My First Visit,5.0,,"Took my kids for their first visit to night safari and was me and my wife’s first times too although we are true blue Singaporeans. The place is ran in a very organized manner. Staffs are friendly and helpful. We were lucky to see most of the animals roaming while taking the tram ride. There are also a good variety of nocturnal animals to see. Very educative and informative too. Though the photos can be quite expensive though. There is a great variety souvenirs and merchandise. Very nice and cute plush toys, and cute shirts design for the kids. Would be better if the counter staffs can better inform the customers of ongoing promotions and tie-ups with certain credit cards and membership cards for customers to earn reward points and get discounts. Overall, wonderful experience. Will come again."
,,A Delightful Experience as Always,5.0,,"I had lost count of the number of times we visited Night Safari. It was always a great night out with plenty of surprises (as the exhibits & surroundings are dimly lighted, we literally had to squirm hard to spot the animals, something kids were excited to do). However, binturong was missing from Creatures of the Night show when we were there. Hopefully it is just temporary..."
,,Please read,1.0,,"If you are considering going to the night safari, you should also consider throwing your money in the bin!
We were looking forward to this experience as it is supposedly one of the top 10 things to do in Singapore but we were bitterly disappointed!!! If you only have a few nights like we did, chose wisely. Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the bay are a must, along with the night show at the gardens. Whilst the transport to and from the night safari is excellect and cannot be faulted, the experience itself is not. We waited over 30 mins in the queue for the trail, this would have been fine if there was anything good to see. It was fairly short ride, it was too dark to see some of the animals properly and some animals seemed to be positioned far too closely and in a good position ""sleeping"" to be real? We really did feel that this was a waste of our time and judging by the number of people on the first bus home, we weren't the only ones. We were considering the zoo but after a poor experience spent our time elsewhere."
,,Overcrowded and Overhyped,2.0,,"Night Safari is a tourist attraction omnipresent in all Singapore itineraries. But why? Before you decide to go here remember you are paying for it. And paying for what exactly?
When you buy the tickets for the safari you are assigned a time slot for entry 7:30 pm, 8:30 pm and 9:30 pm. If you are in the first slot then by 7 pm there is already a queue of more than fifty people each in every entry line. And this line is to only get inside the Night Safari. Handy tip is to take the left most queue as that is the only one from which you get a view of the Thumbuakar (Fire Dance) performance.
Once entry starts there will be a mad rush to get into the lines for the Night Safari Tram. Entry took us about 15 minutes and we decided to not get into the Tram instantly. Instead we moved straight for the Creatures of the Night show. There is quite a rush for this as well because this shows are limited and show timings fixed. We managed to get a good enough spot but the show was nothing great.
Another mad rush to get out of the show once it's over and stand in the Tram lines. Luckily by now the crowds had subsided considerably and we were able to get into a tram in 10 minutes. The entire tram ride with its audio commentary lasted about 20-25 minutes. It was informative but the actual sightings are a hit and miss thing. We couldn't locate quite a few animals in the dark and didn't have enough energy to come back to the enclosures using a walking trail. In fact we hardly saw anyone on the walking trails. So I guess everyone just came for the show and the tram ride.
Post the tram ride we went for our buffet Indian dinner at the Ulu Ulu restaurant which was included in our tickets. The food was poor to say the least. The buffet spread had a green salad counter, 2 vegetarian curries, 1 daal, 2 types of rice, naan, papad and ice cream. That's it. So no choice at all. We barely managed to fill our stomachs and were too tired to go anywhere else.
Our cab back to the hotel was booked for 10:30 pm but we were out by 9:15 and decided to just take a taxi rather than wait so long.
If you want to experience what a night safari is like then it's worth a visit but if you want to see animals or explore wildlife then this is just a waste of time. You should rather spend more time in the zoo or the bird park. And don't book tickets with the dinner buffet included because the Indian dinner was just pathetic."
,,Exciting and Silent Night,4.0,,"Try to get in the earliest hour of entry because the zoo has many interesting attractions. I went in quite late which was at 10pm so i had little time to enjoy the place. I had time to walk the shortest trail which was ‘Fishing Cat’ trail and even that was interesting. There were many many trails so be energised and prepared. BUT, you have to be patient and quiet to spot the animals since you’ll be walking at night though the trails are lighted. There was an impressive fire show and an amazing animal show. Overall, though my visit was short it was still an enjoyable nocturnal experience!"
,,Private Buggy Tour was brilliant,5.0,,"I decided to book the Private Buggy Tour where it is advertised that you are with a group of 7 - however on the evening I went, there ended up being just two of us and I felt like I was treated like a VIP during the whole experience. The tour was planned to finish around 9.45 according to the itinerary but we were still going until well past 11pm.

On the private tour, you get to jump all the queues for the show and you get to stop in front of the animals and ask questions rather than being on a general tour tram and the grand finale is that you get to feed the elephants.

I thought the whole experience was amazing and it was well worth paying the extra to have such a brilliant and fun experience."
,,Worth it,4.0,,"We went to the night safari at the end of august it was very busy when in the queues. However, the night safari tram was very good the voiceover was informative and well timed. The animals all had adequate sized areas and you were able to see them well because you past by quite close. We also attended the talk show after which we found fun, interesting and informative! Night safari was fun for all and worth the trip!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,There was a lot of people! People push in line and run through the crowd but don't stress take your time everyone will get to see the show & get on a bus for night safari. I suggest more workers to control the crowd it was frustrating people pushing and shoving I felt bad for old people & children. It was a awesome experience!
,,Busy zoo but worth a visit,4.0,,"We arrived at 6.45pm to watch the fire show thinking we would watch this then the 7.15pm show. The show was packed out by 6.55pm so we waited in the very long line for the team. About a 15-20 min wait for our turn. The team ride was awesome. So nice to see the animals awake, eating and moving about. We were ushered straight from the tram to sit around 25 mins to wait for the 2nd show. It was packed out by 8.05pm so make sure you get in early. The show was good but too much time taken on audience participation or sending message to people to turn off flashes. The walk around the park was great. A very long day for a 5 year old who had already spent 6 hours at River Safari but was worth it."
,,VISUALIZE THE ANIMALKINGDOM IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT,5.0,,"Entire tour was very well organized with the allocated landscape.
All animal who love to be out in their natural habitat in the dark were
there as if waiting to meet us while we were driving thru' in the tramway
crossing different belt zones. Also the information provided during the
guided tour was very essential giving more insight on their survival."
,,Excellent Family Outing,5.0,,"wow what a great experince ! Taking the little tram through the zoo at night you will see all the animals up close and personal. It's so well done you have the impression that the animals are not even in cages and that you are on a real safari ! The only downside is the long lines to get onto the tram. With little kids at night this can be a problem, my youngest slept through the whole visit."
,,Research research research,5.0,,Several of our friends said this was a must visit while in Singapore. What no one told us was that the lines are insanely long. Make sure you plan accordingly. But the animals and the night safari itself is amazing.
,,This has to be the best Zoo?,5.0,,"Visited 20 years ago and have always remembered this as a must see, it didn't disappoint second time around.
Not generally a Zoo fan but walking through a tropical jungle style area late at night and seeing animals active and acting as naturally as possible in an enclosed environment is amazing. In most Zoos you often don't see many animals as their all hiding away but as these are nocturnal they are up and about. There was only one enclose where we couldn't actually see the occupants. We spent three hours walking around and didn't even notice it was nearly midnight."
,,Great idea but could be improved,3.0,,"The idea of a night safari at the zoo is a great one.
Singapore Zoo have the set up and infrastructure to make this really special but there is just something a bit lacking.

When you arrive everyone is lining up for the tram ride, so you follow suit. The tram ride lasts about 40 minutes and goes around most enclosures.

If you go on the tram, not things are on the right hand side. The only big animals on the left is the tiger and the elephants. Lions, Hyenas, Rhinos and Bears are all on the right hand side.

The tram ride is very hit and miss and that is what let’s the Night Safari down. There is no reason why the tram has to be continually moving. It would be far more interesting if the tram stopped when at some of the bigger animals such as Lions, Tiger & Hyena.
It would be improved again if there was some interaction such as the animals being fed when you drive past, otherwise most of the animals are just lying there, sometimes not even visible.

We got lucky that the tiger was at the front of the enclosure as we drove past for 5 seconds, if it has been at the back we wouldn’t have seen it at all.

All in all the tram ride felt rushed and it could be so much better.

Make sure you don’t get off the tram and walk with the crowds right through the exit. The Night Safari isn’t just the tram ride, there are several walking trails giving you the chance to spend more time at the enclosures and even see some animals that are not part of the tram route.

Again the walking trails could be improved if the animals were interacted with by keepers, otherwise like us you won’t see the leopards and you’ll be luck to see the tiger."
,,Decent enough...,4.0,,"Spent the evening at the Night Safari and the overall experience was decent enough. Tram ride takes about 40 minutes and we had purchased skip the line tickets, otherwise we would have queued for another 40 odd minutes. After the ride we did three of the walking tours and probably enjoyed this more.
Overall, its quite expensive for what it is but we are glad we have been there."
,,Sorry but not good,2.0,,"Hi visit with my 3 Kids it’s 40$ ticket to see a very few same usual animal like dear, pig, and elephant nothing special it’s 40 minute ride on tram and feel more like village zoo where you pay 3 or 4$ and see some animal it’s really not a safari."
,,Solid experience although very crowded,4.0,,"Large crowds - no chance to go on the safari cars. If you are smart with your time, you can see the fireshow, see a decent amount of animals both awake & sleeping on the walking paths, & check out the Creatures of the Night show (the host lady was great!). Be prepared to suffer stupid fellow tourists flashing the poor animals and touching them when they were just told not to touch them."
,,Singapore night safari,4.0,,"Seeing the animals in a night time environment is really good and different from the normal zoo experience,only draw back was the long wait when we got there at our allotted time , would recommend getting fast track tickets for the small amount it costs to avoid the wait we had."
,,Better to visit during daytime.,3.0,,We visited the zoo at night but quite disappointed as most of the animals are neither sleeping nor out of sight as the place was dark. I recomment to visit the place in the morning or afternoon.
,,Great show,4.0,,Nice and fantastic adventure! Good to find local language guidance and know detail of animals in night time.
,,Night Safari tram,4.0,,Was good but signahe is quite poor and we miss the night show as we get out of tye park... we then needed to re enter but the show was full... we didn't wait as the next show was an hour and half later and my kids were tired
,,Must see,5.0,,Amazing place where you are part of the jungle. Definitely must see in Singapore. I advice to buy the ticket online
,,Underwhelming and overcrowded,3.0,,"We were really looking forward to this tour, having been to the zoo previously in the day and loved it.

There is very little to see that you don't see clearly in the day. The animals are fed in a spotlight as the train went past. The commentary track was excellent and I did learn about the animals featured.
So many people.
The small children on the train really enjoyed it and were scared at times.
There was a good fire twirling show."
,,nice but dark,4.0,,nice attraction. very crowded. tram ride is nice. however very difficult to see the animals as it is quite dark.
,,Night safari,4.0,,We took the walking safari through the zoo. It was amazing. There is an option to take a tram as well.
,,NOT WORTH WATCHING,3.0,,Not worth as you see very few animals in badly lit areas. We had to wait in queue for almost to 1.5 hours for tram.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Good guidence.Within timelimit explained about each animal and so happy to visit during night time.
,,Family outing to the night Safari,5.0,,"Well run, fun, interesting and even educational. Queuing system efficiently organised and staff are friendly and helpful"
,,Very good time with the children,4.0,,"Very good time with the children, lots of animals night activities to watch. Walking is the best to enjoy at your time, spend more or less with each of the zoo members, depending on whether they are awake or asleep. Children were fans!"
,,Short but satisfying,5.0,,"Night safari was a really nice experience. Especially my 6 year old son loved it very much. You get to see a lots of animals including Rhino, Malay tiger, White Lion, elephants etc. Good for friends & family."
,,definitely magic,5.0,,"we went with the apprehension of discovering an overrated environment, but we discovered what Singapore does best: to impress !"
,,An experience beyond expectation,5.0,,Best in Class location for an once in a lifetime experience to watch animals in an natural habitat surrounding under nocturnal conditions.
,,Worth doing but not amazing,3.0,,Clearly a very popular location and the crowd management was excelllent. The optional show And the tram’s commentary lacked spontaneity seeming over scripted. Some great animals to see on the trip but too many species of deer to keep the kids enthralled.
,,"Doesn’t worth the money, visit the zoo during the day if you have small kids",1.0,,"We took a taxi to catch the first tour starting 7.15 and it was a peak traffic time. We got there after 30+ minutes and it cost $35 from Sentosa Island. You can buy tickets there. We missed the first tram but The tram actually leaves every 10 minutes,the line was long but it was moving fast. It was really hot and probably took 15 minutes to get on it. We got on the tram( the ride is around 30-40 min) It doesn’t stop and some of the animals are sleeping , laying down and hard to spot. We saw white lion , elephants, tapir, Fox,tiger, flamingoes, rino and lots of deers.you are not allowed to use flash and when the tram keeps moving everything is blurry. But after the ride, that’s it, so for 40 minutes ride it doesn’t worth the money, kids got tired of waiting in the line and the ride so we went straight home. If you go to visit with kids go during daytime at the zoo but if you don’t have kids you can give it a go, because after the ride you can walk around and there is a show later on but the kids were exhausted and didn’t want to wait and line up for another 30-40 minutes for the show to start"
,,Family visit @Night Safari,4.0,,"A bit frustrating on the number of viewed animals, but ok with the pedestrian trails.Too much crowdy"
,,Too dark and little variety on animals,2.0,,We took the tram for the whole journey..the light is not bright enough at those animal spot..and also the variety of animals also very little.
,,It was fantastic!,4.0,,My family really liked to see animals in that way. Wish we saw many animals and good if the countries from where the animals came were also mentioned.
,,Eye opening experience !,5.0,,This is my first time visiting Night Safari & it was amazing! The tram ride was the most enjoyable moment where I can see animals this close. But a bit disappointed not being able to see any giraffe and zebra..
,,A nice scroll at night,5.0,,"The attraction is very organized with tram ride and night show to show the visitors night animals activity in a short time frame. If you still have time, you can take a stroll around the park under the stars to observes the animals at your own pace. Temperature is slightly forgiving at night in this tropical island."
,,All I expected and more,5.0,,"One of the last pieces of advice I was given before I arrived was to take time to 'listen'. In the tropical night there are many sounds to hear on the night safari - roaring lions, howling wolves just to name two. In the day we are so busy looking we forget to use our hearing sense - at night it comes into its own. Awesome."
,,Not so great as expected,3.0,,"Creatures of night show was always full, queue too long . Animals seemed to be in slumber, not energetic."
,,Cool vibes,4.0,,Really interesting concept for a zoo! Saw some really cool and interesting animals! Was difficult at times to see certain animals in their exhibits but the ones we did see were great! The creatures of the night show was alittle short but super cool!
,,Good must visit attraction,4.0,,Its a must visit when in Singapore although have become more rushy with waiting periods & ques as compared to 2011 when i last visited. Still its very good
,,A must see but there will be queues,5.0,,There is a theme part atmosphere here with the queues to match but that's mainly for the tram and that is more than worth it. The tram ride is much longer and more interesting than expected. All the charismatic animals such as tigers you struggled to see at the Zoo next door you get to see clearly here. You absolutely must allow time for the walk.
,,Very good but too crowded,4.0,,The concept is very good and most animals seem to be resting but the experience is surreal once it starts . The problem is before it starts there is too much crowd. The staff are very friendly and cooperative but the long ques at both ticket and entry is a dampener.
,,Amazed this time round,5.0,,The tram ride was awesome. Driver would slow down for visitors totake a look up close with the animals. Go early so you won’t miss the animal show.
,,Great,4.0,,"We had a great time during night safari in Singapore. The night show was amazing and the creatures were well trained. The information boards provides a very well explanation about wild creatures, its natural habitat and all. Value for money and much entertaining. Especially good for children. The location is also easy accessible through buses."
,,Great,4.0,,"We had a really great time on the night safari. We saw every animal listed on the map and the staff were really friendly.

We saw the creatures of the night show which was entertaining. My only qualm would be the price of the taxis getting to and from, which sort of outweighs the ticket prices..... but if you do the walks (which we didnt) it would have been more worthwhile."
,,Good night Safari,3.0,,"To be really honest the night safari was fun, for the first 30 mins or so, because after all it is in night time and it is a safari, seeing those animals in their normal behavior, sot of, until you see most of them asleep, then you realize, meh what a waste, we should have gone in the morning when at least we could see most of the animals awake and about. But an experience is an experience nonetheless. We also experienced a scare when we so a snake cross in front of us, but it wasn't a worm sized one, it was long and long...

To sum it up, I think you should go to the zoo in the morning rather than night time, but if you want to experience something different there's no harm in trying it out."
,,The drums were beating.,5.0,,When visiting Singapore make time for the Night Safari you won't be disappointed so book ahead and get better deals.
,,Improvement needed,4.0,,"While worth going, this experience was not on par with other zoo venues. Problems started with the onsite ticket purchase, the location of which was confusing. By definition it was dark, and many animals were difficult to see on the tram tour. Better luck was had on the walking trails. The otters were very active and entertaining, and seeing a pangolin was a treat. Crowds were poorly handled, with everyone being forced to stand in one line for the trams, rather than placing lines throughout the park. The amphitheatre show was corny but fun. I recommend the Night Safari, but will probably not return for a second visit."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The night safari is known world wide, the tour itself takes you through various exhibits and enclosures, this is a must do with children as they will love the interaction with the animals."
,,Must visit !!,5.0,,"A place that must visit, love the shows and take the tram to go around the zoo . Interesting ride and there are audio explanation ! You can walk on the walking trail as well. Try go as early 7.30pm to cover all the walking trail."
,,Great idea but lacking severely,1.0,,"Well... staying in Sentosa so paid $45 for a taxi which took 45 mins. All good so far. Then we were told the internet tickets were no good at the gate (after queuing) and was sent back to the Food Court to swipe them at a hidden machine to get real tickets. Annoying, but ok... only a slight inconvenience.

Waiting amongst the throngs of other sweaty bodies in a conga-style queue for about 45 mins.

We boarded a glorified golf buggy and the safari started. Yes... it’s a night thing and I have 20/20 vision BUT I saw sweet F.A! No, sorry, I saw about 10 different species of deer, 1 sad lonely old bear who clearly was so embarrassed he wanted to curl up and hide, a few elephants (which was good), giraffe was overseas on holidays so he was absent without leave, the tiger which I managed to squint and get a 3 second view of, and two variants of pigs.

I was somewhat amused to hear the recorded message saying “rhino horns and elephant tusks are causing their extinction, so please don’t kill them!”

Looking around the buggy, I noted that most guests were of chinese extraction who ironically are the culprits in their extinction. No shifting around uncomfortably in their seats to show any form of remorse.

Anyhow, 40 mins later, we ended up back at the start. Thank God! Another 45 minute aircon taxi ride back to Sentosa.

The best part? The aircon taxi which brought us home. Don’t bother doing this attraction. They are taking the piss charging this amount and giving you a night time sweaty golf buggy ride!

Yes, my 2 & 4 year old loved it... BUT... they’d love ANYTHING that got them from going to bed at their normal time!"
,,Above average experience,3.0,,"You'll get to see animals in the dark. That's it, that's all, it's just another zoo, but in the dark"
,,Animals are alive and kicking during the night,5.0,,"Singapore's night safari is one of the few in the world that you should visit. The animals are alive and kicking during the night. We even got to experience a lion's roaring or wolves howling when they are usually asleep during the daytime.

Ticket sales are open from 5:30 pm daily. There are a few options - One is the Night Safari tour via tram and Two, you can explore on your own via foot.

If you choose the tram option - If you have a choice, DO NOT, I repeat do not choose the 7:15 pm or 8:15 pm slot like everybody else. If you do, be prepared to queue at least 45 minutes to get unto the tram. Choose the 9:15 pm or 10:15 pm slot when the queues are much shorter and less stressful for you and your family."
,,Unattraktiv,2.0,,"This experience was unfortunately bad. The animals were sometimes plastic animals, painted like real animal. For example the antelope in der middle of the lion cage.We bought tickets for 8.15 pm. We had to wait with hundreds of people around one hour to sit in a tram and run through the night zoo within 40 minutes. Everyone told us we have to be as quite as possible, that the animals don’t get frightened. But the explanations about the animals sounded very very loud over loudspeakers. This was really ridiculous.The ticket price includes only the bus ticket to the night safari. To get back to the town you have to buy an other ticket. It doesn’t cost that much, but no one gives you that information till you are on the spot. As well as you can buy tickets for the night safari till almost 11 pm. But the last bus back to town leaves around 10.30 pm and you have to get a taxi. This is really impertinent."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,First time to visit night Safari. Animals are active in the night and we enjoyed very much. One thing regret is Lion feeding seemed off service on Sunday. Even though we waited 15munites.
,,Consistently the same,4.0,,After 4 years went here again. Everything is the same which can be good or bad. The place does not look rundown so they have done a good job maintaining it. A lot of people were here on a Wednesday night which was surprising. Overall it is still a worthy inclusion and a must see in your Singapore itinerary.
,,Don’t waste your money or time,1.0,,"The worst attraction I’ve ever been to!!! Not worth the money at all we travelled to the safari via taxi there were 6 of us so had to get 2 taxi, some drivers refused to take us there so had to wait until a driver took us, he charged us $35 one way to the zoo once we got there we were told by one member of staff that we should watch the show first the other said use the tram so we lined up to join the long queue waited for the tram and drove off slowly we couldn’t hear what the recorded lady was saying as there were children screaming and shouting in the tram very annoying!!!!!!! We saw very few animals most were sleeping or the animals were just repeated so we saw lots of wild pigs from all over and different kinds of dear and buffaloes, the tiger made a small appearance and disappeared behind the rocks, you don’t get close you don’t get to feed the animals or see them properly as it’s very dark. Yes it’s a night safari but don’t call it a safari if all you do is sit in a golf buggy and drive around, seriously do not waste your money or time as you have limited time on your vacation and you don’t want to ruin your holiday we paid £42 per person for zoo entry and $60 for return cab to the hotel!!!! I would rather have spent that money on universal studios again!!!!!!!"
,,Sanitized safari for the masses - not for me,2.0,,"Admittedly, I shouldn't have tried to squeeze the night safari into a very short stop over in Singapore, and I arrived a little after my booked time of 8.15 a little grumpy anyway. The first half an hour of my safari experience just made my mood worsen! I hate being channeled through a large, crowded fast food area, and then I had to queue about twenty five minutes to get a place on a trolley bus. The drive round wasn't my thing, either, with a rather sensationalized recorded commentary on each set of animals we saw. I did enjoy seeing a few of them - the Asian Lions, the white African Lions, and the Flamingos especially, but the fact that they were on show for us, and probably every other trolley bus that made it's way round the road, made me remember that I don't like zoos - the animals cannot have much freedom to roam where they want to, and some of them did look jaded. I cut my losses after the trolley bus experience, and made my way back to my hotel. I imagine that if you don't mind zoos, and especially if you went with your young family, then this could be enjoyable. But it just wasn't for me, I am afraid."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Went there not knowing what to expect. Was pleasantly surprised by everything. There’s a nice fire show outside the park with some talented performers. Inside I walked around a bit before catching a show of Creatures of the Night. The commentator spoke with very clear English so it was very easy to understand. She impressed me by knowing how to say turn off the flash in 10 different languages as well!

The show was great, a cute Chinese girl named Jocy made the show unforgettable trying to fool the bearcat. She was unsuccessful!

After the show I jumped on the tram and I was impressed by the space the animals had. Normally I’m against zoo’s but the animals in this one really seem to live a pretty normal and nice lives with plenty of space to roam around. You get to see some exotic animals that don’t really move in safaris etc. during the day because of boiling heat so I really liked the whole concept of a night safari!

I’ll be back!"
,,Good to see the zoo at night,3.0,,"We came to night safari with 3 people. 3 of us really are looking forward to some incredible things in this tour on the tram. Actually, it 's not make me disappointed. We had a chance to see a lot of animals which have the night activities. The lion made me feel impressive. But there are a lot of deers on the way we visit make me feel uncomfortable.

Anyway, i think if we went by foot, it would be better than the tram. But the guide recorder was fantastic on the tram. It gives you the awareness of protecting environment.

That is the great tour to learn more about the animals"
,,Unique and a must visit tourist attraction,4.0,,"The kids will love it and the wild animals wander freely across the safari, you can almost touch them. Try to be early to avoid huge queues."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"The one thing everyone told us we MUST do was the night safari and it did not disappoint. We booked tickets for 9pm and getting in was a breeze, no queue at the ticket machine nor at the entry gate. We then took the advice of other on Trip adviser and decided to walk around the zoo before taking the train/shuttle.
We saw so many animals, it was fabulous. Having taken our time around the zoo we arrived at the train stop at around 11 and jumped straight on a train to see everything else.

A wonderful evening with the highlights being the elephants and the lions."
,,Unique experience for family,4.0,,"The experience of seeing a zoo at night is a must do for everyone who likes to travel. It starts with a show called the ""Creatures of the Night"" that gives you a little preview of some of the night creatures you will see. Although the line for the tram ride is usually very long it's like any other popular attraction that is worth it to wait. The tram ride is interesting and if you're lucky you'll see animals close up and active at night. My favorite part is hiking on the trails after the tram ride. I enjoy the walking and getting close up to the night animals. The best is the fruit bat enclosure. It's a scary feeling to be so close to bats at night. Just like watching a vampire movie!"
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Night safaris a great experience especially going in a tour group as waiting times are not as long. The actual tour was very interesting and it wasn't too short or too long - tour time was just right, aprox 45mins. You can see animals at a good distance. Heaps of food choices to choose from and it was a very comfortable atmosphere."
,,Too crowded,2.0,,"Planned a family trip to night safari to celebrate my mum birthday. We took the 8.15pm slot. The queue for the tram took 50 mins, as we were traveling with kids so we decided to wait for it. However, all the excitements were gone even before boarding the tram. Also the nightshow is always on full house. We didnt managed to get into the two shows and of course didn't want to wait for the third. I personally think that the amount we paid is not worth it at all. We probably won't be going back again."
,,Night Sfari,5.0,,Staffs was friendly and welcoming and very helpful as well. Beautiful animals and very nice attraction to be at and affordable as well for a simple date.
,,Expansive and boring!,1.0,,"Every normal Zoo what I visit by day was better and cheaper. The way from Singapore City to the Zoo with Taxi is long and also expansive. All in all we pay for 2 adults with zoo tickets and taxi about 170 Dollar for nothing special. So the Night Safari is in the dark, so you see less animals for more money!"
,,Waste of money,2.0,,"So we pre booked this tour with our travel agent before we left for holiday. We also paid for a buffet dinner and skip the lines of people waiting so paid dearly for this, just under $200 NZ per person. What a total waste of money.
We visited in May 2018. At this time of the year it is another country’s holiday season and they came by the bus loads!!! It was very unfortunate as it completely ruined the whole experience. It was way over crowded and I would have to seriously ask how they allowed so many people in. Did they have any idea? Anyway clearly our tour guide left us too long at dinner so by the time we then got out from dinner and off the safari tour that was it. The fire show had finished and everyone pushed rushed and made their way to the show. It was so full you didn’t get a look in so overall only got a basic buffet and a quick safari ride. Totally disappointing on behalf of management. Why try and push through thousands of people to have us disappointed. Our whole group felt the same. Limit your numbers and give us what we deserve or you will loose your agent bookings. Very disappointing to not have you inform the guides even of the situation that night. You either mismanage or don’t care how many numbers you have onsite. Please safety first."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,The night safari is worth every moment! Its open until midnight as well! The experience you get from view the animals so up close on the shuttle ride is so insane its amazing! Some animals I had never even seen before and they are only metres away. Well worth the trip out there and all ages on the shuttle ride where enjoying it :)
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"We booked this thinking we would enjoy a new experience, but it is poor value you struggle seeing the animals and do not get good photos. would not go again."
,,Expecting more,3.0,,I will rate our visit as average. We were expecting more. The tram was old and making lot of rattling noise while movement.
,,An awful experience,1.0,,"Long Queues caused mainly by bad crowd management.Waited over an hour just to hop on the tram. Visitors were rushed through the zoo on a tram which should have made stops for visitors to get on and off. Due to the delays from queuing we also missed the shows.Very disappointed. Have visited previously on many occasions and enjoyed our visit, but something has gone badly wrong at the Night Safari. Suggest readers of this review to double check before visiting . Do not waste your time with this zoo. Will certainly not visit it again. SAD...it was once very good."
,,Long waiting time but nice experience after all,3.0,,We purchased our tickets online for a certain time slot but had to wait for almost an hour anyway. This way it became very late for the children. Nevertheless we enjoyed the visit and were impressed by the beautiful environment.
,,Truly one-of-a-kind after-dark wildlife adventure!!,5.0,,"Opened in 1994, Night Safari Park, Singapore, is the world’s first nocturnal wildlife park. Today, the award-winning park welcomes more than 1.1 million visitors a year. They come from all over the world to enjoy the unique experience of seeing over a thousand animals in their naturalistic night-time habitats.
12-time winner of ‘Best attraction’ category awarded by Singapore Tourism Board, the star of the Night Safari experience is a guided tram-ride that takes you across six geographical zones of the world. From the rugged Himalayan foothills to the swampy banks of the Asian Riverine Forest and more, our tram-guide shared fascinating facts and tales about the animals and habitats along our journey.
We can explore the walking trails to see even more animals not visible from the tram journey. We may also stroll into the realm of the animals at the two giant aviaries, where the Malayan flying- foxes and giant flying-squirrels can come right next to you. The aviaries are along the Leopard Trail, where we can get within a whisker of the beautiful leopards from their dedicated glass observatory. Heading along the Fishing-Cat Trail and we can look in on fishing-cats, as they engage in their nightly river-side hunt. Then, we can trek right into the Outback to discover native wildlife of Australia, including a family of wallabies in their walk-through habitat along the all-new Wallaby Trail.

No visit is complete without enjoying the famous performances filled with humour, thrill and surprises. We caught the talented troupe of tribal warriors, as they thrilled us with their fiery stunts in the ‘Thumbuakar Performance’. We didn’t miss the must-see ‘Creatures of the Night’ show. This highly entertaining and interactive 20-minutes’ show highlighted the natural abilities of some of the most fascinating animals.
As we whetted our appetite for adventure, we made sure to indulge in Night Safari’s unique dining offerings - from gourmet fast-food to popular local delicacies served in the traditional village ambience of the Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant.

We understood that more than just being Singapore’s No.1 nightspot, the Night Safari Park has also been achieving success in their effort to support the conservation of bio-diversity. We read that over the years, they have bred Malayan tigers, Asiatic elephants, fishing-cats, Malayan tapirs and Asiatic lions, among other endangered species.
Our group of eight thoroughly enjoyed this awesome experience!! I certainly recommend that everyone who visits Singapore must make it a point not to miss this attraction."
,,Delightful visit but long wait,4.0,,I had a wonderful visit to the night safari. The animals were quite active - you could even hear the wolves howling while on the walking trails. However the line for the tram tour was very long. We were booked into the 8:15 entrance time and was in line at that time but didn’t get onto the tram until 9:15ish. The tram tour itself was great and lasted about 35 minutes but just be prepared for waiting in the humidity.
,,Price is high for a short ride and few animals. Not recommended to anyone It’s a SCAM,1.0,,Price is so so high for a short ride and few animals. Not recommended to anyone it’s a SCAM pls don’t buy n don’t visit
,,Half of the attractions were full or closed! otherwise it's the best place to see in Singapore!,3.0,,"If half of the attractions were not closed off or full, I would have rated the night safari a 5-star as it is my fav place in Singapore..On my recent visit we stood in more than an hour long queue, only to see the 15 something minutes safari in the electric vehicle, and missed out the wallaby trail (where you walk between the wallabies) other animal enclosures like reptiles, and the very interesting animal show which was full, all this when we went at the 21:15 time slot when they had 2 more later time slots at 22:15 and 23:15!Happy as always to see the beautiful animals in the gorgeous night setting, but it could have been so much better if I could have visited something, anything more than the electric buggy safari :(Anyone going do better checkup with any local or Safari's own customer care to check which time slot they should visit in so that they don't miss out any of the open attraction! and do book your ticket online before hand, it saves time."
,,Long queues and no other option,3.0,,"I remember the night Safari when you could pick up the tram at different stations, so you could partly walk and partly tram. Now you have to pick up the Tram at the main gate and consequently the queue is unbearable. We were in line for about 2 hours. The long wait was not a one off as we've been several times with many other visitors and it's always been the case. It's a wonderful experience walking around the Night Safari, so if you don't want the queues, do that. That being said, when you do eventually get on the tram, the experience is good too."
,,Overrated,2.0,,"Maybe we went too early and got the earliest slot 715pm. Barely can see the animals though there are good info about them provided on the side board. Disappointing to walk all the way to lion lookout and can’t see it at all.To get onto the the tram ride is quite fast despite the good crowd. However the ‘cabin’ we sat in, we can hardly hear the recorded commentary while the tram was along. Seems like the sound was clearer in the middle cabin.Did not live up to my expectation for the price we pay."
,,Unique Concept....,5.0,,It was an awesome experience. The concept to visit the wild animals (who are open) in a night safari is unique. Thank you night safari for this unique experience..
,,Wasn’t for us!,1.0,,"Below average experience sadly! Even having camped overnight for Wimbledon tickets, this queue is unbearable. So much more could be done by the team to make this a more rewarding experience for their customer’s once you actually get through it. I feel so sorry for the staff whose job it is to herd people like cattle and shout at them to move from one queue (for the train) to another (for the show). Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone."
,,Worst Experience ever of a noisy moneymachine,1.0,,"Finally our daughter was big enough to come along to go to the Night Safari, something we really looked forward to. Arriving at the entrance was more like the way I imagine Sartre's Hell, like a war zone with thousands of people in queues around the different entrances/exits. We were assigned to a wrong queue but got in pretty quickly. Then again what meets you is just an enormous noisy crowd of people in line for the tram that takes you around or show or shops. After waiting 20 minutes we gave up and needed a toilet, Then we were told we had to go out again. No thanks. So we started walking and for some places where there were no crowds it was really nice to see the animals, what we really came for. But in most of the stops the crowds were too big for the space so me and my daughter could not see anything. We went to the lion feed and by climbing on the fence and my daughter on my husbands shoulder, we could see the lions and that was great. But all the time a tram comes along with loudspeaker facts repeated. Some encounters with owls and jaguar were great. But totally a visit I would never do again."
,,Night safari,1.0,,"What an appalling rip-off. Queued for two hours for ten minute ride. They pushed through 3,000 visitors on the 8:15 ride."
,,Awesome day ended with a appalling night,1.0,,"After an awesome day at zoo followed by the river safari. We killed some time eating to head to the 8.15pm nightshow.
As our lad has low muscle tone and autistic we thought we would do the tram. DON'T
Though staff was nice and let us in entrance a little earlier. It ended up almost a 2hr wait along with what felt 500 people shoved in a zigzag cattle crush. Hot very little seating. Lots of children asleep in parents arms as well as prams. Seeing some trams with only two people in seats until finally our turned. Then others were jammed in with us.
Our son did so well to wait soooooo long. Finally on our way no flash photography but that's okay as at least 1/3 of the animals were hiding anyway.
This firstly would be better if they could work the hrs in with zoo or safari so folks could would have something to do in between second show.
Secondly your tram lining up system is appalling. I could never reccomend this in all honesty. It would of been less traumatic if we just walked around and that's saying alot"
,,disappointed,2.0,,long long queue for all activities. The tour is short. The show is always fully booked. Disappointed attraction.
,,Overrated Place,3.0,,This place was really buzzing as there were so many tourists. We were only allowed to ride the tram and listen to the commentary in the tram. Not allowed to walk around on our own. The Creatures of the Night show was boring.
,,Beautiful and safe,4.0,,"One can go by Tram or walk through zoo..walking is also very safe .Masters are posted at various corners .we went by tram,apprx 30 min ride,complete with commentary. It is better to visit on week day to avoid long Qs. though long Qs ,line moves vert fast,Can get ticket at counters or can be booked on line.for tickets there are packages including River safari, zoo, night safari.all are in same location .tram takes you to almost all animals
Elephants,lions, rhinos etc..100% safe for all age groups. Animals are in open but surrounded by barriers There are night shows also.It is safe to take taxi after late night show.Even"" Grab"" taxis are available.Pl do not visit in heavy rains. One can visit Zoo,( 4 hrs )then River ride( 2 hrs ) and then Night safari in that order in a day ,All are at same location."
,,Totally overrated,2.0,,"The hype around the Night Safari is undeserved. Huge long queues with overstressed staff (which make you feel you are in the queue for a security check at the airport), and which take far longer than the events themselves (be it the show or the tram). THey should not admit as many people - the whole thing becomes a stressful exercise in waiting in lines.
The show is ok, but not worth the wait, especially as two thirds of the auditorium are reserved for bus tours. The tram tour is ok too, but you don't see half as many animals as advertised. Basically a tour in the dark, which is fun, but overhyped.
THe food at the cafeteria is mediocre.
Why not a ticket counter at the Night Safari itself, instead of making people walk all the way back to the Zoo entrance?
Overall a HUGE disappointment, for adults and children alike."
,,"Amazing, amazing, amazing",5.0,,Spent a good 4 hours in the park. The night show & tram experience is a must-see and well-worth your money!
,,Consider a zoo visit at night,4.0,,"My daughter and I headed to Singapore Zoo for the Night Safari, which in my view wasn't worth the queuing time. However, when we got there, we found that almost the entire Zoo was open at night, and 80% of the animals were nocturnal or crepuscular, and hence awake. We had a very interesting time wandering around until just before midnight seeing the animals in the relative cool of the evening,

If you aren't a nightclub person, I would highly recommend a night visit to the Zoo."
,,Great for all the family,5.0,,Thankfully booked for the 7.15pm team tickets as it was nice to have a seat after running around Singapore for the day! After the tram it is a must to walk around the park too. We saw pretty much everything (except the fishing cat) and my kids loved running around the jungle at night! Loads of food options too but I would get there early to eat. We missed all the shows as we were too busy seeing the animals. My daughter and I then went to the 10.30pm paid Lumina show afterwards but that was also a lot of walking. Well worth it if your feet can handle it!!!! Well organized and really excellent excursion.
,,"simply not worth it, if I could give 0 stars I would",1.0,,"I have only ever written one other review but this experience has moved me to write my second. This is really a terrible experience. Got there 2 hours before the first entrance at 19.15. had to queue for 30 minutes to pick up my online ordered tickets, along with hundreds of people who didn't pre-order.. what is the point of that? Then told the 19.15 was already fully booked so had to hang around nearly 3 hours to get the 20.15 entry. The restaurants are typical zoo restaurants. we ended up eating KFC for want of anything better and which I like anyway. Then get ready for the circus. Thousands of people filing into what look like iron sheep pens, winding around for about 60minutes waiting to get on a trolley bus. I was with my two little daughters and my wife, it was torture for all of us. Nowhere to sit properly, hot and humid. Surrounded by an incredible number of people. At this point we have been at the zoo for 4hrs and had not yet seen an animal. The event itself was about 40mins only, annoying voice over commentary that kicks in at every section of the safari, no chance to enjoy the silence or the animals as they are basically about 30 meters away and you are not allowed to get off the bus. Add to that the other passengers shouting at the tops of their voices and hopefully you get the point. This was a wasted evening all round. Singapore needs to get it fixed. It is an embarrassment to the government. I went 10 years ago on this safari, it was another world, 1000 times less people, peaceful, hop on and off the bus or walk the whole route, easy viewing of the animals. That has all gone. I would rather trap my head in a door than do that again."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"We went to the night safari. It’s nice if you have children, but nothing too exciting for adults. Too dark to actually see most of the animals. The creatures of the night show was good. The wait for the tram and the show is very long and the ride and show are very crowded. I think it’s overpriced for what you get."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"We were really looking forward to Night Safari after previously visiting the zoo during the day on a previous trip to Singapore. We had pre-booked our tickets which we thought would make the experience more enjoyable. Unfortunately on entering the Night Safari we were greeted with long queues and a very busy holding area prior to joining the tram. Disappointed that the commentary was pre-recorded and the guide more interested checking his phone for most of the journey. We did see several animals, but only briefly as there is no opportunity to stop and no flash photography. Overall a disapppointing and expensive experience. We would not recommend in its current format."
,,Horrible yes it’s exactly the correct word,1.0,,"Too much waiting, I did 1 hour queues for just get my tickets that I bought in advance + could not get at same time my zoo visit and night Safari ticket.... so I had to do 1 hour for getting night safari ticket.

Safari is the worst thing that I did in Singapore. I don’t recommend it to anyone specially if you go with children. We could not attend their show... each and every show time was full so I have the feeling that I wasted my money for nothing... same thing for the tram... more than 1 hours queue.

I am so disappointed!"
,,Mixed comments,4.0,,"I do enjoy the ride but the youngest and the oldest members complained about that they couldnt See the animals clearly . It is totally understandable as the environment needs to be dark for the well-being of the wild animal.
We were offered to go via the special entrance as one of my family member was injured and was walking with a crane . Thanks so much !"
,,The Ride is fine but the Trails are the Best!,5.0,,"We did not do any of the dinner packages, we simply showed up and got in line. The ride was OK, but walking the trails was absolutely wonderful. The tram doesn't always go by the habitat at the right moment, so you may miss some animals. By walking the trails, you get to see everything. This part of the park is not open during the day, so it's definitely worth taking the night safari."
,,loved the experience,5.0,,"I liked our visit to the night safari, especially the creatures of the night show it was funny. but the view of the stage wasn't that clear we didn't see most of the animals on the show because we were sitting on the left. most of the animals in the safari were animals that you can see in the morning in there zoo nothing that special about the night experience.Overall it was fun"
,,What a disappointment!,1.0,,"We were told the Night Safari was a must. Have never wasted so much time & money on anything. Cued up for over an hour - twice! Once to get in, then to get on the transport, which was useless. Couldn't see anything and most animals were nowhere to be seen. So very disappointed."
,,Good but really busy,4.0,,"Ok, so my family really enjoyed this (wife and teenage daughters) but I was less taken. The queues at 8pm were huge and we were in low season on a school night. We were hearded to the night show, which we knew nothing about and was ok but aimed at younger children really. Once we were out we were then in the queue with everyone else for the trams which was about 30 mins. It was only then did we see the walks around the zoo. I'd advise:
1. Arrive as late as you can.
2. Walk around the zoo first as there are some great things to see and you let the queues go down.
3. Take the tram, timing it before the show kicks out (around 5 to the hour and 25 past the hour) when the queues are the least.
4. Then, if you have children go to see the show but by then it is quite late.
5. Buy tickets on line and download them on your phone then head for the shortest queue possible to get in!
Be aware - unless you are a great photographer photos from the tram are hard as the ligh levels are low (by design!), the tram is moving and you rightly can't use a flash so don't hope for photos like those on the website!"
,,Public holiday crowds,4.0,,Try to avoid going on the eve of public holidays as the crowds are huge. The entrance times are staggered to limit the numbers and you need to book ahead. The wait for the tram was 45mins-1hour so we abandoned the queue in favour of walking. The show was pretty good.
,,Far too much queue to enjoy...,3.0,,"2 hours standing for 45 mns tour, makes it less fun... especially when it is not so efficiently organised."
,,Super crowded but worth it,3.0,,The early night tours are super crowded. Walk on walking paths first to see animals up close then go on the tram ride.
,,Too crowded,2.0,,"There were at least 500 peop;es queuing, it felt like we were going to a show from a pop star. The vehivle was so noisy that we could bearly hear the comments and we did see only half of the animals presented."
,,Window Shopping at Night Safari,1.0,,"Our trip started with 45 minutes queue for the tram. During the tram ride, many animal are not present while our tram pass by. All timing full house, we didn’t get to see any."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,We had to queue for ages to actually get onto the tram - seems pointless having a time slot as they all merge into one. We were unable to get into the show as they were all full except the late one which was too late as we had to catch our transport back.The overall tram ride was disappointing as we didn't really see many animals & the ones that were out we only got a glimpse as the tram doesn't stop .We got to see more animals on the trail walk which we did only one of themMy advice is don't book the tram as you can walk the trails in probably quicker time than waiting to board.Would not do this again as it was a Total waste of money & time
,,Overrated !,3.0,,"I booked advance tickets for this Safari as I did not want to miss, as my kid loves to see animals. Since this was famous, I was sure that there will be something 'good' about it.

Unfortunately, my expectations were too high. First of all we had to wait for 45 minutes for our turn as there was a huge crowd in an'1-hour slot' window. Although crew members were doing their best to manage the crowd, but that was not sufficient. There were 5-6 stations to catch the Safari Tram, but people did not know that and all rushed to number 1-2. There were very less number of Fans put up in that hot temperature. This becomes difficult to manage with infants/toddlers.

At last, in a 25-30 minute safari, it was very difficult to 'notice' the creatures, as it was too dark or sometimes animals were too far. I could not understand the reason for showing those in 'night' as most of them can be easily seen in daytime. I did not find anything special about it !"
,,Mmmm,3.0,,"Our time was 8:15 but it took long time to get into the train . We missed the show becouse when we finished from the tour ,there was empty seats!!"
,,Enjoyable and entertaining,4.0,,"We had an enjoyable time, the tram ride was fun and had an awesome experience. The food was expensive."
,,take a walk,5.0,,dont wait for the tram. take a walk! staffs are really friendly and helpful indeed! will be back in our next visit in singapore!
,,Amazing Singapore,5.0,,Night safari was truly an amazing experience. I recommend people to go for Juroong bird park instead of the zoo. The river safari is the day time version of the night safari. Same animals are seen during the day from a boat while in the night it will be from a tram. Plus there is an added attraction of LED light shows in night safari .
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Probably one of our best things we did whilst we visited Singapore. Just at it turned dark (7.15) we did the tram ride followed by an hour of walking around the night animals. A surreal experience and the kids (7/9) loved it.
,,Animals in the dark,4.0,,"Although extremly crowed, enough staff to guide everybody to have a great evening. Some constructive criticism: While waiting to enter (You will have a dedicated time slot) it is nice that they offer some entertainment while queing (some type of fire dancing). However it is a bit weird that just before the show of the fire dancers starts, they open the gates so people enter the night safari and miss the fire show. Why not do the fire show 15 to 30 minutes before the gates are opened. That way you will entertain the people while they are waiting. Tjhe night safari it self is great experience both using the tram as well as when walking around."
,,"great concept, way too many people",3.0,,"It is unfortunate that the lines are so long and the whole visit is inadequately explained on the Zoo website. If it was explained, for example, that you can just walk most of the zoo and see the animals without the crowd/queue for the tram, then many more people would just take that option, our group included. It was a one hour wait in the queue for the tram. We could've leisurely walked the whole zoo in 1.5hr and avoided the crowd. Yes, the ""crowd"" in mainly the queue for the tram drive. Another way for the zoo to make the experience better is the raise prices or do certain ""adults only"" days. I am a strong advocate for adults leisure activities without kids."
,,Very Nice!!,4.0,,"We enjoyed the tram ride so much that we went on it twice 👍🏻👍🏻 The walking trails were good as well... will definitely go again!,"
,,Must See When in Singapore,5.0,,"I generally love going to zoos. I decided to avail the Singapore Zoo + Rainforest Lumina promo admission they currently are offering for this month. I loved the open concept of the zoo and how the institution is conscientious of the well being of the creatures. Tips:1. If you are going solo (like me), go in the afternoon. By this time, the bulk of the visitors have gone already. And the sunset/dusk makes for a picturesque photo.2. I recommend allotting 3-5 hours to maximize your visit. I was walking at a relaxed pace. I gave myself enough time to just sit, observe and take photos of the animals. Plus side of not rushing, when the animals were in hiding, the other visitors would just move on. I, on the other hand, would wait a few moments and they would just appear out of their hiding briefly before retreating again.3. There's water stations everywhere. So make sure to bring your water bottle. There's also a lot of vending machines. You can use cash or an EZ Link card. I don't remember the denominations that the machine accept. But to be safe just make sure you have SGD 2 notes.4. If you are going to do the Rainforest Lumina nightwalk, bring insect repellent spray. If you can withstand the humidity and the warm temperature, wear long bottoms. 5. Please be a responsible visitor. it's really basic but I have to reiterate: Be mindful of your trash, dispose properly, do not tap on the glass or use flash photography and be considerate of the other people around you. If you see anyone disturbing/stressing the animals (flash photography/tapping the glass), please stand up for the animals and call the attention of the park personnel.Other tips:- charge your camera battery (have an extra one with you)- SG is very humid and warm all throughout, especially mid day to afternoon. I brought a cooling aloe vera mist with me.- if you get hungry, there's food available. You can bring your own snacks, I think. But the prices are relatively affordable. Personally, I'd rather buy at the establishment. Because it is also one way of supporting their cause.Hope this was helpful!"
,,Expensive,2.0,,Too much dark didn’t see anything wellAnd lots people almost waiting 40min but safari less 30min i think
,,to many Chinese,1.0,,"While the attraction itself is nice, more staff are needed to stop Chinese guests from running/pushing/shoving other guests out of the way to get priority seats. It really makes the whole experience unbearable"
,,Family safari..,5.0,,Everything Enjoyed and Good maintains.Something Different from other countries.Thanks to Singapore
,,Too many exhibits you can't see any animals in,3.0,,"Was on one of the first trams out after the 7.15 opening and many of the exhibits you couldn't see any animals in. Maybe they were still just getting the animals in their pens but to me was not worth the trip. I do admit I did try and do all the 3 parks Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari in the same day and I do feel that it was just too much. But with the 3 parks so close to each other and a distance away from central Singapore doing the trip twice would be costly."
,,Surprise visit,4.0,,We expected more from this place. There is long queue in this place. Waited almost for an hour to get into the train
,,Not great.,1.0,,"Now according to my perspective you can skip this instead put your money and time on morning singapore zoo.

Pros
Open safari not closed in netted van.
If you want night experience in jungle it is good.
Shows are good to experience.,but not better than jurongpark. Instead shows in singapore zoo much more better.

Cons
You can or cannot see animals, at times not clear.
Waiting queue huge not worth waiting for, put some more money for express trams.
No photos possible due to dim or no lights.

In short if you want to actually see animals and spend some time with them and have photos then strict no to night safari, otherwise if first time visit to singapore better to decide according to your choice."
,,extremely crowded,4.0,,"we booked a tour as we thought this would give us quicker entry but it was a disaster as
we were left waiting for over an hour as the driver went to the wrong hotel which then made our whole bus late for the tram tour and everything else we had to wait for over an hour and half for the tram rise and this was the express lane so i did feel sorry for the people in the normal line as it was extremely hot as well. the animals were good to see if they were awake but taking photos is hard without a flash"
,,Not very easy to get around,3.0,,"We really enjoyed the actual safari part, where we got to see the animals. However, we had to queue for a very long time to get to this point. It was incredibly busy but I didn't feel the crowds were very well managed. It was also hard to figure out where to go for the walking tours. Some more sign posting would be useful."
,,"Safari OK, but poorly organised and long queues",1.0,,"The safari itself was 'OK' and something different, we did get to see the animals fairly close up...

However... The major let down was the organisation and massive queues. We pre purchased tickets online, assuming it would save time, however when we got there we faced a 45min queue to get the tickets (where to get them wasn't obvious) .. Then had to wait another 2 hours for out time slot (why can't we select a time slot online??). Once inside, there was at least another 60min wait to get on a tram (this alone, would of been acceptable)

We went out there on the hop on hop off bus.. The last bus heads back to the ITU at 10pm - given the queues there is little to no chance of getting it back... We had to catch a grab (17sgd), at least there was free WiFi.

Overall, good, but I can't rate it any more than 1 due to the poor organisation and lack of direction."
,,Good experience. Don’t go in the last schedule because you will need more time to see more. At least 4 hours.,3.0,,"Don’t go at the last scheduled. You will need at least 4 hours so you can visit all the tracks, show, etc. We expected a little bit more."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"World best night zoo, here call it night safari. There was differ timing to let the guests go in, and it spread out Nicely for us to enjoy the show , move around. Good arrangement!"
,,A great experience ..,4.0,,A must to do things when you visit Singapore. But be prepared to wait in long queue (at least 1.5hr) even on the weekday for your tram ride.
,,Nice and Enjoyable Zoo,4.0,,"We had a short visit to Singapore in August, and decided to spend the day at Gardens by the Bay and the evening at Night Safari. It turned out to be convenient and fun-filled combination. At Night Safari, we enjoyed the Creatures of the Night show and the Tram ride. It was quite a long queue for the Tram ride, but well worth it as it introduced the animals and drove around the park. The park does a good job promoting the conservation message."
,,Nice but too commercial,3.0,,"Nice to see animals in the darkness but environment too commercialTake the train for a first round, then walk"
,,Best getaway for kids,5.0,,It is not very far from the city Singapore and hence easier for people who live inSingapore to just go there when ever the kids demand. It's a convenient and fun time spent in the zoo. Animals can be seen clearly even in the dark. tram ride makes it super easy to visit all the enclosures. The only draw back of this place would be the food which I not that great. But if you are coming after dinner then this is the best place to take kids.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"We were first time visited to Singapore, I went online to booked the tickets before we arrived, there were many people besides local, we arrived on time while we had waited for forty minutes to got on the train, my kid and I were so excited and enjoyed at Night Safari"
,,LONG queues and waiting around for everything. Never again! Be prepared to be patient!!!,1.0,,"Despite buying tickets online in advance, hoping to bypass the long queues of people waiting to buy tickets - this did not happen. You still need to queue to 'collect' your tickets?!
We arrived at 18:45 hoping to attend the 19:15 but we were disappointed to see this was already sold out, as well as the 20:15. The next available time was 21:15! A long wait with no a/c seating areas available.
Once our scheduled time approached, we again had to queue for the tram. it was mayhem. So we decided to see the animal show - more standing around waiting outside the amphitheatre for over 40 mins for this to open. The show was disappointing. We left early.
We waited in another queue to go on the tram - the queue did move fairly quickly this time but by this point it was after 22:15.
The last straw for me, was the sight of the elephants - they were displaying signs of depression, swaying their heads and moving from side to side. Not great at all.
I really felt for people with small children - all the waiting around would be too much.
My only advise if you did want to go, is to arrive at 5pm (or even earlier) to buy or collect tickets (as it seems to make no difference) and eat there (there were lots of choices) - that way you have a chance to go into the park at 19:15 - maybe do the walking trails first, then try the queue for the tram once you do get in."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,We walked the trails first then took the 40-45 min tram ride after. Loved it! Would definitely recommend.
,,Family visit,5.0,,Really amazing ! The best part is walking around and encountering so many unusual animals in close proximity. It has really expanded and developed over the years and my family were delighted to visit.
,,A night to remember,5.0,,We were in awe when we visit the night safari. Amazing! An experience of a life time. Simply surprising! 😊
,,Great Idea but expected more.,3.0,,"The ride was good, but most of the animals could not be seen as they were in the dark. I understand that the animals are in their natural habitat and we can’t force them to be on stage for every tram ride, but I guess it’s disapponting when you don’t see what you paid for. The wait was about an hour even with tickets purchased for a time slot. Not ideal. I think overall, was a unique concept, but fell short of my expectations in terms on value. Not something I would do again or recommend to others. The tram seats 4 across and this impedes your view when the animals is on the other side of the tram. Can be missed easily as the tram even though slows down does not stop long enough."
,,Extremely attractive safari for both adults and kids,5.0,,Well designed with sophisticated route and management way to let you have a different experience with those lovely animals. Will definitely come to visit again!
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Loved this place!! Such a different concept from anything anywhere else but really good, you get to see lots of different animals up close in a natural environment not caged or in small enclosures like a normal zoo! Loved it !"
,,Sadly really disappointing,2.0,,"After all the positive recommendations, our trip to the Night Safari was really a disappointment.

Booking on-line resulted in a number of phone calls because the e-tickets couldn't be sent and on arrival it isn't clear where to go (you have to go to the zoo to collect).

We were early so decided to eat there, which was a mistake - what we bought wasn't available when collecting the order, the food (chicken) was then stone cold and finding a table was really very difficult - lots of people sitting there having a drink waiting for their entry time (not knocking them, just not enough general seating around). When we found a table we needed to clear it and then do our best to clean it (there wasn't enough staff clearing and cleaning tables). I've added a picture of a wipe that showed how dirty the table was, which surprised us as Singapore in generally so clean.

Once in, it is confusing which tram lane you can and can't use, we ended up in lane 1 on direction of the staff who just waved us in a direction of a queue. it then took an hour and half to get to the front (I wasn't happy with the number of people who skipped the queue/ pushed in because they had family or friends already in the queue keep a place for them (which I hate when you have stood there queuing in the heat for an hour or so).

Once at the front, the trams for lane 1 were arriving pretty much full (at least 4 or 5 arrived like this that I saw) and used our queue the fill any empty seats (mainly seats for two people only, which doesn't help if you have a family of 4). Any empty trams were going straight to lane 2 (which had smaller queues). Seemed really disorganised and when I asked why we were waiting for so long and why the trams were arriving full I just got a blank look!

I would still recommend the visit, however I wouldn't eat there again and would investigate the queue situation before choosing which queue to join (if there is a option). There are at least 4 or 5 tram queues and perhaps we were too eager to join the first queue we came across."
,,Do you love queues?,1.0,,It’s 10pm Monday. I’ve been in the queue since just after 9pm. I’m nearly there. They have fans but it’s not enough. This sucks.
,,"Underwhelming, but an experience all the same",4.0,,"I know its August in Singapore, but my god was it sweltering. We went for 8:15 and by 8:30 we were drenched, so that maybe affects my opinion of the exhibits. A lot of animals were easy to see, but a lot weren't. Overall I'm glad we went, but maybe I was expecting more."
,,Nice Night Safari Tram Ride but Buffet Dinner So So,3.0,,"Nice tram ride tru the places of the different animals. Beautiful, lush greenery on the route. But can add more lights as it can be very dark in some areas, one can hardly see the animals. But Dinner at Ulo Ulo wasn’t good."
,,Night Safari with friends,4.0,,"Great evening, did the tram ride first, followed by the show and then walking routes.

The rangers were feeding the animals as we walked around so got to see a lot of activity from the animals. - It was 10 when we started walking.

Creatures of the night show was really good, the presenter was good and really funny.

Only downside is the time queuing in the heat"
,,Visit to the Night-Safari,4.0,,Very good organisation. Besides long queuing a very attractive tour through the all-outdoor zoo. We enjoyed our stay at night safari a lot!
,,Great time exploring,5.0,,"Entered through the 7.15pm ticket (best to buy online beforehand) and immediately went for the Creatures of the Night show, where we learnt more about nocturnal animals. We also walked all the trails and took the tram. It was a fun and interactive environment where we learnt more about the animals at the Night Safari. We also encountered a few student volunteers at the crocodile enclosure who told us more about the crocodiles and their volunteering programme where they come to the Night Safari to talk to visitors to increase awareness on conservation on animals, which was a great takeaway for us. Had an enriching time!"
,,Very nice zoo,5.0,,It was a great experience. We walked the trails after the tram ride. Initially we planned just a short walk but ended walked till midnight because there were so many interesting animals to be seen. Highly recommended to have enough time to explore on foot and not just the tram ride.
,,Would have been awesome if there were fewer people,4.0,,"My 10yo daughter and I came on time for the first 7:15pm session, had to wait for about 40 mins to get onto the tram. In the hindsight, if we came at 7:50 we would have waited a lot less. Make sure you go for a walk after the ride. Even though there are lots of people, and some are quite noisy, it was very entertaining."
,,Terrible!!!,1.0,,"Could not get any worst!! Most of the animals can’t be seen or it’s empty. The walk way is very dark, the directions are equally bad and not friendly at all. Please do not waste any penny here"
,,Great night,5.0,,Heads up you need to book a time slot!!! We got there it was manic reception gave wrongvticket order . Once sorted food eaten we had 9.15 booking. Not all annals can be seen but u get this anywhere ! Loved the trip and done tram at end it was an added bonus . We loved it
,,Nothing really fantastic,3.0,,"I decided to visit the Night Safari after a few of my friends visited it and told me it was a different experience from visiting a regular zoo during the day.
However, I did not find it really special except that I was walking around in the night and had to look carefully in order to spot the animals in their enclosures. It seemed that most of the animals were either resting or sleeping even though they were supposed to be nocturnal creatures.
I actually got bored after a while and left after walking around and then taking a ride on the tram that goes around the night zoo. Another thing that bothered me during my visit there was that I got bitten by mosquitoes while I was there!"
,,cant be worse,1.0,,The lighting system is not professional at all. Cant stand with the Chinese visitors's camera flash (especially from cell phone).
,,Night Safari,2.0,,The waiting queue are fast and the tram guide is good unfortunately most of the spot are too dark. We are not able to see the animal and photo taking is not possible.
,,Good Experience,4.0,,Buy tickets ahead of time so you can get in when they open. They have times for the tickets and we thought it was for the tram tour but it is actually for entrance to the zoo so its important to get the 7:15 ticket or you will be waiting to get in until your time comes up. Its great to get so close to the animals on the safari.
,,wonderful nocturnal animals,5.0,,"What a wonderful way to see interesting and endangered animals at night in a lovely forest setting, we enjoyed the Tram ride then the Show and after that we walked some of the trails. overall an excellent experience and the only complaint was the length of the tram queue, but I suppose on Saturday night that is to be expected"
,,Great Safari,5.0,,Our tour guide Teogo was knowledgeable on all to do with the region as well as customs. I would recommend as todo when in Dubai.
,,"After numerous visits, it's still very enjoyable",4.0,,"Pros: The cool ambiance, engaging animal show, close up with most animals and tram ride Cons: Long waiting times for the tram, no possibility of boarding the tram from the second stop"
,,horrible weight time and too short,1.0,,"The safari is at night, though they give you time slots, they make you wait for 1-2hrs in line without sufficient seating before one can get the tram. The tram ride is too short. And by the time you get the tram, kids are already at sleep and too tired standing for 2hrs. It was a total waste of money."
,,A once in a life time honeymoon attraction in Singapore!,4.0,,Get to experience the nocturnal world in the form of a safari complete with an interactive show where they showcase some of the animals.. Highly recommended! My wife & I had so much fun while on our honeymoon in April 2017
,,Worthwhile despite horrendous queues,4.0,,"I’ve visited the Night Safari 4 or 5 times, practically every time I visit Singapore. It’s the one thing we seem to absolutely have to do when we’re in town. The kids never seem to fall out of love with it.

Over the years, it’s gotten more and more crowded, and more and more expensive. It’s still worth going to though.

Here’s what you get for your SGD47 a head. There’s a tram ride, about 30 minutes long, where you can see various macrofauna in a night environment. The lighting is discreet, and is just bright enough that you can make out what’s going on, yet continue to shroud the animals in shadow if they wish. This is the highlight of the visit.

My favourite part of the tram ride is the tapir exhibit, where the tapirs will often come right up to the tram. Keep your fingers in the tram - tapirs bite! As tapirs are active mostly at night, it’s a unique opportunity to see these animals when they’re not asleep.

Sadly, the number of instances where tourists ignore instructions and use flash photography seems to have increased. On my last visit there were at least 3 people using flashes on the tram, despite the driver telling them not to. I hope they enforce this rule better.

The queues for the tram can be long. We queued for 20 minutes at about 9pm. You can skip the queue for SGD10 a head. But a far better solution is to get on at about 7.30 or 8 when it’s less crowded.

There’s also three walking trails that feature animals and exhibits you can’t see on the tram ride. I like the pangolins in particular. You can also see an assortment of cats, from the usual big cats (lions and tigers) to the more unusual (clouded leopard, serval and fishing cat).

There’s a great moment on the fishing cat trail where you cross a bridge over a pond. Halfway through, if you look down, more often than not you’ll see a 8 foot gharial below you.

It’s a good idea to bring mosquito repellent, as the trails are outdoors in a jungle environment. Also, avoid the tour groups (easier said than done, on some nights), as many nocturnal animals are shy, and tour groups are noisy, despite much effort from the staff and tour guides to shush them.

There are also 3 animal shows each evening. They’re not very long, are usually crowded, and more often than not I skip them.

You can get a drink or ice cream at various cafes throughout the Night Safari, but the main catering options are outside. There’s a large food court, with many Asian food options outside the entrance. You can re-enter if you get a stamp on your hand when you exit. While eating, you can enjoy the fire dancers performing.

I still recommend a visit, although the crowds are somewhat off putting. Let’s see how long it remains worth a visit."
,,Don’t waste your money,2.0,,"As other reviewers have said, it is like going in a Disney-fied version of a safari, except you can’t really see anything very well. The tram ride has very loud recorded voice-over, referring to animals you can’t see and not staying next to the enclosures long enough to work out where they are. Plus it’s a good half hour taxi ride to get there each way. Don’t bother."
,,Fan!!,5.0,,Walking safari was so exciting. Night safari was not a zoo but a savanna. I wanted to go again soon.
,,Long queues,3.0,,Helpful staff at reception counter outside ticketing; long queues for tram. Exhibits was quite interesting.
,,Walkng is Best,3.0,,"Went to the Night Safari with a young toddler. Armed with internet tips, we booked our tickets online for the 7.15pm entrance slot. We went first to the animal show which is fun for kids, and you get to see animals do tricks and owls flying. The tram line after the show was a one hour wait so we walked instead. The problem is that you cannot get on the tram halfway which makes it very inflexible. So you have to choose to walk or to take the tram.
Walking, we got to see animals up close if they choose to come out. But can be tiring for little kids. Bat cave was cool because you can see it up close. And the black bears were out for us to see. When we finished at 930pm, the queue for the tram was for at least another hour. So we skipped it. We took the city express double decker bus to Orchard Road and that was fun for kids. Will not recommend Night Safari for the elderly because of the crows and walking and waiting."
,,Weekday Night Safari Visit,5.0,,"Recommend getting tickets online as entry goes by timing. The queues may look a bit intimidating but the Night Safari folks are super nice, helpful, and efficient! We arrived at 7pm, had dinner, and then lined up for our 8.15pm entry.

Would definitely recommend walking as some animals take awhile to warm up and actually even appear.

Quite a number of tourists, sometimes they can get quite loud but if you just chill and wait it out, they'll leave (they're usually on a schedule so they can't stay too long anyway)

Saw some really inconsiderate guests who kept flashing phone torchlights, actual torchlights, and camera flashes...DO NOT be That Guest, please.

But otherwise, the whole walking experience, the animals, the atmosphere, even the mozzie situation (almost NONE), and the staff were SUPER. Definitely take your time when you go. We were the last patrons to leave the park and by the time 11pm hit, we could really take in everything at an amazing pace and felt really good about our whole experience:) We actually covered all the walking trails too even though we were practically strolling!

P/S: beware of flying squirrels pooping! You'll know if they're nearby;)"
,,Visit to the Night Safari,3.0,,"Too many tickets sold for one slot. Ruins the experience as you have to wait in long lines to get in. Due to time and energy wasted in line, cannot explore the park by foot. No indications of free shows or where they are held, their timings and other such details. While the tram ride was good, the overall experience was bad. Needs much better management."
,,At your own pace.,4.0,,"Get ready for queues and being herded by staff who aim to manage customer throughput. We skipped the live show after being stuck in the throngs and opted to walk the park instead. By the end of the tour, crowds had died down and we took the bus ride through the park. Apart from the queues, this was a great experience."
,,Overrated,2.0,,"The show was poor and boring. We were asked to get in earlier in order to secure seats. We went in at 8pm for the 8:30pm show and were ushered to squeeze in a corner while the better middle seats were all “reserved”. However in the end, the reserved seats were not fully taken and we concluded it may be better to come in later to get better seats. I did not manage to catch the front view of most of everything that happened. Absurd waste of our time.

As for the rest of the park, as the lighting was dim and the areas where we can venture on foot are limited, there really was nothing much to see in this night safari to be honest.

Quite a rip off. My 3rd time here and everytime I visit, I feel very cheated of my entrance fee."
,,Expensive and very crowded,1.0,,"The ticket prices were expensive, the discount for Singaporeans was marginal

The website is very poor. Almost impossible to find basic information such as opening times, admission times (until you get into the ticketing page) etc etc. It is also not possible to buy tickets for Singaporeans and non Singaporeans together on the same cart: this is a basic flaw

On site, there were no signs at all to the fire show whatsoever.

The crowds were huge, especially waiting for the tram. Why are there so few trams and why are some trams idle?

Most enclosures were so poorly lit that the animals were barely shapes.

The lion enclosure was very poorly landscaped so the lions could hide just by lying down

Conservation propaganda overwhelmed the website and the tram voice guide at the expense of useful information

Overall this was a poor experience

The gift shop were manned by very cheerful assistants though, and i appreciate that"
,,Really disappointing,1.0,,"Very crowded, felt like a number on this place. Animals are not interesting or spectacular (mainly pigs and antlops...). Very expensive for such a poor quality park"
,,Dal Molin,3.0,,the line to go onto the train is too long for family with your children. we waiting 1.5 hours or more to get onto the trams but we arrived on time at the venue. with kids not advisable
,,worst safari ever !!!!,1.0,,"we are just back at our hotel from the night safari and I can honestly this is the worst zoo/safari we have ever been to and we visit the zoo and safari wherever we travel in the world.

i know that there is no guarantee that you see animals on the night safari but to spend the amount we spent and to have crap commentary from a recording that was wrong (look on the left and you might see bears eh no they were on the right!!!) was ridiculous.

Then to have an animal show where the animals were either held or ran on for food and then left was pathetic. And the woman who was the commentator of this show was awful.

We were really really looking forward to this after it being recommended and us loving zoos and safaris but for anyone looking at doing this

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!

The staff are more interested in looking at their social media and getting people out of the park than making the visit enjoyable."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Expect to walk for at least an hour or so, it's verry crowded I recommend the express tram pass the walk is tottaly worth it and if you have a stroller expect to push uphill allot so wear comfe shoes and get a small fan as it is humid overall great experience and will recomend it highly"
,,Dissapponting,2.0,,"Saddens me to write this as my family were really looking forward to it.

We went on the night safari, and it wasn’t what we were expecting.

You can walk the zoo and see a select range of animals or you can get the tram and go around the zoo in about 40 minutes.

The line for the tram takes at least 45 minutes and it’s very hot waiting.

On the tour you see way too many deer and animals you can see anywhere in the world.

If you are going with kids, pack heaps of water and walk the first couple of hours.

Found the Zoo to be bland"
,,Great!,5.0,,Great to see animals in a different way. Be prepared for huge queues & a very long wait to get on a safari train but worth it. You can also walk around the trails which is worth doing.
,,Animal lovers will find it enjoyable :),5.0,,"I'd like to preface my review my saying that I love animals and I hate seeing them in captivity. My partner and I had objections about going to the Night Safari because we are against the concepts of zoos, and putting animals out for show. But going around the Night Safari made us change our minds.

We made it to the Creatures of the Night show. It was fun and the animals were beautiful. They didn't look emaciated at all, and I saw some animals I had never even heard of. It still makes us sad that there are animals who've had to learn to do tricks (we don't know for sure how they're trained, and that they're not subjected to any pain during training), but it's a small comfort that they looked more anxious about the huge crowd of people trying to touch them (DO NOT TOUCH THE ANIMALS) than having to do tricks with their trainers.

After that, we did the tram ride, which was amazing. The ride will take you around the park, through the 7 (or so) different habitats available. It wasn't what I expected. The animals were in enclosures, yes, but their enclosures were marked off by wires in strategic spots rather than having them all be behind glass walls, or bars. The more dangerous animals also have enclosures that go deeper in, putting a greater distance between them and the trail so that the human presence doesn't cause them much bother, if at all. So as long as you don't have flash photography, you should be fine.

Also note that you may not be able to see all the animals on the trail. Some of them like to hide or run off deeper into their enclosures. The hippo, for example, was in the water and I could barely glimpse its nostrils peeking out. And I didn't see any of the Indian wolves. But that's a small price to pay, if it means they still get to behave as they would in the wild.

I admire the efforts to preserve the area to be as close to the animals' natural habitat as possible. And the voice over of the tour also said that visiting what the park earns goes towards its animals and towards animal research, because the park transmits its data to institutes conducting animal research. I haven't been able to confirm it, but if the state of the animals are any indication, it seems that they're treated well and with care.

Ideally, animals shouldn't have to be kept in captivity, but with all the poaching going around, it's become necessary for parks like this one to exist. Captive breeding seems to be the only way to make sure they don't go extinct, and it's a way for us to learn about them with the least possible intrusion, I suppose. It was enjoyable, and I'd go again if it meant being able to give the animals more support and funding.

A note: we used mosquito patches to make sure we didn't get sucked dry by mosquitoes. I didn't get bit at all, but my partner, who is a mosquito magnet, got bit despite the patch. So, heads up for other mosquito magnets out there, you may need extra protection."
,,first of its kind,4.0,,"I have never seen so many animals in my life combining this and Singapore zoo, and this standa out as I saw animals with a few feet distance with no barrier. We literally passed a deer with a feet distance. Bear, stag and what not.
the moment of the day was seeing tiger from up close (of course through a glass) . This beast can thrill you. We completed all 4 trails. Best was Tiger trail followed by Wallaby trail.
Only reason I gave it a 4 rating is due to poor management-we had pre-purchased tickets yet we had to stand in queue for 70 minutes. please improve this"
,,Night Safari !!!!,3.0,,"Since i bought the 4 in 1 park ticket , it had the Night Safari included as well which i had initially planned on not visiting. I choose the 7:30 pm slot which is crowded if you plan on seeing the park on the trams. The lines are too long and takes a lot of time for the tram ride. I rather choose to go on the walking trails and enjoy the park. Not a must do if you have already been to the Singapore Zoo , but nevertheless a pleasant experience."
,,Average,3.0,,It was a good experience..we went for the night safari.. it’s different and more exciting than visiting the zoo during the day. I gave it just 3 stars as there is a very small variety of animals
,,I like it so much,5.0,,It's quite interesting to visit Zoo during the night when animals are awake and active. It was great experience.
,,Not Worth it,2.0,,We were little disappointed at the night safari. We couldn't see many of the animals as they blended with the darkness. I would rather spend time in Arab Street or do some other fun activities as Singapore have so much to offer.
,,Very disappointing,3.0,,"We went to the night zoo. This involves a little train. However, the animals were not nothing to write home about. They were just the same as in the day time but in the dark! The food at the Zoo was really disappointing."
,,"Sales, sales",2.0,,It's an ok excursion but far too expensive for the value. There was three of us and it cost about $120. You are encouraged to purchase the express team at $10 per person. The pre show was done very well.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"It was unforgettable and unique to see the animals in their natural habitat in the night, especially animals that only live in Southeast Asia (I live in Finland). I highly recommend walking the trails instead of taking the tram (waiting time over 1 h on a Friday at 21 h). You can see the animals a lot closer, stop and observe them and wait if they are not in sight at the moment. The paths are not long or steep, they are well lit and if you have a map you cannot get lost. But some animals (elephants, rhinos, tapirs) are only accessible by tram."
,,Not worth the wait.,2.0,,"Waiting times in Singapore's heat are inhuman. You will be on your feet next to hundreds if not thousands of other people. I don't recommend this if you have children (they will be absolutely bored out of their minds until they get to see the animals) or if you visited any other place that day and you are not well rested. Only visit this if there are no queues (note there is a queue at the entrance next to the outside restaurants, another huge queue inside, an yet another when waiting for the tram."
,,Fascinating night safari,5.0,,"You wait in a queue, it feels and sounds like 1 million people. You think: it‘s so loud, will we ever see an animal?
As soon as you enter the electric car and it moves away 100 meters, there is silence. Then the first animals approach. The trip takes about 40 minutes and you will be amazed. The animals are so close and the feeling is just good.
For photographers: you need a top cam for lowlight and a very fast lens. I had a 5d mk iv and the 100-400 lens. Both top but the lens doesn‘t work in the dark. Use 70-200 2.8 or even a faster 100-150 mm prime tele lens."
,,It was ehhh,3.0,,"I think that there was a lot of hype built up around the night safari. I went and saw the show as well as taking the tram around to see the animals. Since it’s an open space for the animals, animals were no where to be seen in 3 of them and in 2 they were sleeping.

If you were to go I’d say do the walking trail over the tram"
,,Well organised,5.0,,"We did the Night Safari with 2 children, 7 and 5 years. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. It was really well organised and we only had to queue for about 10 mins to get on a tram. The commentary was very good and we saw lots of animals up close."
,,Queues++++++++++++,1.0,,"Disappointed with the night safari. Looking very tired! Unable to get into shows/ all full long time before starting. Even though the management had put in place different session times and areas to queue- this is not solving a problem.
If the animals could see humans queuing! - what a sight. We spent the majority of our time at this tourist venue looking at humans whilst queuing. Not what we paid to see."
,,tram ride,4.0,,We only went on the tram ride as we had little time before leaving Singapore. We had a 8:15 pm ticket for the tram ride. We waited approx 30 minutes in queue for the tram. We saw most animals except the tiger. My kid (5 year) really enjoyed the experience. Having been on a 'real safari' i was not as impressed but it was quite nice. i did not regret spending the money and time for it.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The tram ride gives you an overview of the park, but try to book it for early evening because a long walk through the well organized paths is definitely worth it."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"We completely enjoyed everything about this place, the animals were all active, the tram ride was informative and enjoyable even the food and drinks were excellent. Also included were animal shows and a fire dance. A night to remember."
,,Overrsted,2.0,,"Was so disappointed with this. Waited in line for over an hour to have a 30 minute trolley ride seeing minimal animals (I know they can’t control what animals are out roaming but aside from seeing only some animals, a lot of them aren’t impressive animals).
I would recommend going to the Zoo over this. it’s cheaper, you can stay for hours, and you’ll see all the same animals plus many many more. Went in a group of 10 and we all left feeling very disappointed."
,,Busy but worth it,5.0,,We loved the night safari more than expected. We visited during school holiday season so it was very busy but a super experience. Definitely arrive very early to avoid a long queue at the tram and the traffic on the way or come later. Creatures of the night show was fantastic. We only did the show and the tram and wish we had the energy to do the walking trails too so will have to come back! Lots of taxis waiting at the exit so no issue getting back.
,,Great night out!,4.0,,"If the queue for the tram is too long, walk round the park. You get to see different animals while walking as compared to taking the tram. You can take the tram later in the night when the queue is much shorter. You can then relax your tired legs, feel the breeze in your hair and enjoy watching the animals in peaceful silence.

The show was great too!"
,,Too much queuing.,3.0,,"A limited number of animals to view, but the park makes it seem like a lot. Go early and make sure to be on the first viewing slot at 7 15 so that you can see the animals before they go to sleep. The highlight was the Bengal tiger, but I haven't seen much improvement from my last visit about 12 years ago. You can pay to go to the top of the queue, but it doesn't seem fair somehow. Crowds are huge, so expect to queue for everything."
,,Tour,4.0,,"Great tour, well worth booking in advance to ensure the queues were avoided! Walking tour post the trams also very worth while"
,,Great Experience,5.0,,We were a group of 7 people. We met at 08.00pm and walked in around 08.30. We were lucky and there were almost none people in every queue.. We ran the little train and walked through the zoo. We were so exited that we forgot the time and almost got kicked out by the staff! Simply amazing!
,,"Great venue and set-up, but Way to many people",3.0,,"The Night Zoo is a great idea and if you manage to walk either alone or with a group of people, who respect the concept( as in keep quiet), it is a great experience. The train, that supposedly ran every 5 minutes, was so crowded, that we had to stay in line for ages and eventually gave up. We them proceeded walking around the Zoo, which was a great experience, as soon as we managed to “get away” from a large group of young people, that spoke non stop, and spoiled half the fun, the noises."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,The queue for the tour was long and you could barely see most animals. The walk around was much better. The show can’t accommodate the amount of visitors with both 20:00 and 21:00 shows being fully booked
,,Nice encounter with animals upclose,4.0,,It's nice to have a walk in the park and walk right into animals that roam around freely. The tram ride is a short cut for people with little kids so as to minimize walking when the little ones might be sleepy.
,,It's an ok experience,3.0,,"Place was way to crowded. Long queues. We went on the trail but left without seeing the show because of the crowd. An irresponsible group of about 5 Asian adults pushed their way to the front of the line ignoring our protests to go back to the end of the line and in front of children who were waiting their turn on the queue. And when we voiced our complain to the staff at the front of the line, he didn't do anything. He let them through. My younger son kept asking me why the staff still let them in. We visited on 20 July and those irresponsible adults know themselves. Shame on them. And the staff should be more in control."
,,Great place but bad organization,2.0,,"The night safari is a great place and the place is definitely worth a visit. However, I went to the night safari for 8:15 PM entrance and I only got to the tram and walking activities in the night safari at 9:00 PM or more. We were waiting the whole time in a queue and the staff seemed disorganized. They also don’t have any halal certified restaurants."
,,Croweded and too fast...,3.0,,The place was absolutely packed. No control on the number of patrons. The tour was too fast and we barely could see the animals:
,,Stay late to avoid the crowds,5.0,,"I’ve visited a lot of zoos but this was a fantastic experience and included so many animals I had never seen before.

We took young kids but since their sleep patterns were mucked up from jetlag anyway we arrived late and went straight to the creatures of the night show.

This meant we could go to the tram safari without having to line up since most people had left the park. The only down side was that 90% of food outlets in the eating area were closed when we finished (but we still got some great snacks).

If your kids can stay up make sure you book online (with a provider who gives you the barcode so you can go straight in) and go later to miss all the queues in that heat!"
,,walk it to avoid the huge crowds,5.0,,"great concept to see nocturnal animals naturally awake at night, rather than being in a 'nocturnal house' in a normal zoo during the day. The concept and displays are so good that it is a victim of its own success with huge crowds making 40 minute wait for the animal show or to catch the tram ride around. Instead you can almost have solitude and complete the walking trails in about 90 minutes that cover about two thirds of the displays and get to see most of the animals at your own pace away from the crowds - unfoturnately the walking trails dont go past the elephants and wolves so you will miss and few animals in getting away from the crowds and queues."
,,A must see whilst in Singapore,5.0,,"A must see whilst in Singapore, only down fall is the lining up and waiting. If you can go later at night so the lines are shorter."
,,Night Safari Too crowded & loud narrator's voice annoying,2.0,,"This was only my second night safari in Singapore, but the huge crowds, loud narrator's voice on the train safari, loud chatter of tourists and the poor animals, some of whom clearly have behavioural disturbances (pacing back and forth) due to the constant flow of visitors day and night detract from an otherwise well set-up zoo."
,,Exciting!,5.0,,"It was a pity that some animails sleeping could not be seen, but animals acting at night were so attractive!"
,,Rather disappointed,3.0,,"Booked as highly recommended, thought it was fun for my ten year old kids. Getting in was no problem, relatively long line to access the trolley busses but the queue was well managed and only took about 15 to get on. The disappointment came in the way the show was completely full when we finished the tour. Waiting around for over an hour is not an option with young kids and keeping them out till late in the evening is not option. They should provide shows earlier on for those that enter the park early."
,,Interesting Trip,4.0,,"I have not been to Night Safari for at least more than 10years. This return trip was to accompany a foreign friend who wanted to visit Night Safari. The crowd was scary on arrival. We could not go for the 8.30pm show as it was full. The queue for tram was also very long. As such, we took the footpath. It took us about 1hr 15mins to complete the entire visit. By the time we finished we missed the 9.30pm show. Due to time constrain, we skipped the show and left at about 10pm."
,,Absolutely dissapointing,1.0,,"Pricey, overcrowded and far away from city centre. We had to wait 45' in a Long queue suffering high temperatures amid the multitude. They only have few fans and when you are in the trama tour it is Just a zoo with low visibility."
,,Good family night out,4.0,,"I would say that being a local, I am indeed proud of how the fact that we do have such a wonderful attraction like the night safari. We get to see the white lion as well as Chawang the elephant as well as some animals that we do not have a chance to see in the normal zoos. However the down side is that it is too crowded and pricey. In fact the overcrowding turned us off because we had to wait for 30 minutes just to get on the tram and could not even get into the creatures of the night show. The logistics could have been improved to allow more people from enjoying the show."
,,Tram Improvement Please!,2.0,,The wait at the tram line was too long. My kids got very tired and we had to go home. Total waste of money.
,,Too crowded too loud,3.0,,Too crowded and too loud to enjoy the few animals on. Display. Quite disappointing experience actually.
,,Can be skipped,3.0,,"The other reviews found here are very good, but what I feel That this place is just ok fully crowded also not many pictures can be taken due to poor light, but again on positive note overall the experience is good"
,,Good Experience,4.0,,The might zoo experience is really good! If you want to visit all the places you should buy ticket at 7:00PM. Don't forget to queue up 30 mins before for the show.
,,Night Safari a highlight,4.0,,"A nice time to see evening animals is at night, when the zoo is much less trafficked and the weather is a bit cooler. Our daughter, aged 4, enjoyed the night safari and the animal demonstration."
,,Amazing outing,5.0,,Excellent wildlife park to explore in. Various walking trails brought us closer to the animals. Highly recommended
,,Really disappointed with the night safari,1.0,,"I came with my family. We wanna explore the zoo at night time. But when we reached it there, it was raining and we could not see anything. Slippery pathwalk was also made us wanna go back to our hotel. It was dark too and you could not see the animals clearly. Pricey and you got nothing. Prefer the daytime safari much."
,,Night safari,5.0,,"It was a thrilling experience to sit in a tram & view the animals in the dark. All the animals kept in natural surroundings could be sighted, photography with flash was not allowed."
,,A great zoo,5.0,,"Loved our visit to this lovely zoo again
We were here a few years ago and called in to see it again it has only got better.
We came for the Night Safari and were not disappointed it was a great experience, lobed it and when we return to Singapore again we will call back for another visit
Love this country and Its people."
,,Too crowded,4.0,,It's a good experience to see animals at night in some what natural like habit. The show of creatures of the night was great. But the place was jammed with people. I heard the place would be crowded so I booked a online ticket from klook and went their at 6pm. When I scanned my ticket for entry it showed me 9pm entry. So I had to wait outside. One problem with the night safari is taking photos. The lights are too dim for photos. The fire show at the entrance was also good.
,,What a waste of money,1.0,,"Please read thr negative reviews before you go as they are pretty much on point. The cost of this attraction is ridiculous for what you get - no value for money. The person who said all queues lead to same place - thank you as we took the shortest queue and were on the third tram. Once on the tram (or long golf cart to be exact), you get a lot of commentary but it doesn't say very much. The animals are half asleep - which is not a surprise when the commentary says they sleep for up to 20 hours a day. What animals do you see - some elephants, pigs, a lion (if lucky), a bear (if lucky) and a lot of deer.

Highly recommend the zoo during the day - 1000 times better!!!"
,,So disappointing!,2.0,,"Poor website, poor parking, long lines, the tram broke down so they rushed the rest of the tour. If your from overseas save your money and support your local zoo."
,,Night Safari is a failure,1.0,,"This is a complete failure . Not an attraction at all. It's not only waste of money but cruel as well. Animals too need rest ! You can't keep bothering then day and night. It's dark, dangerous and over crowded at ticketing place. I won't suggest going for Night Safary."
,,Absolute terrible arrangements!!,1.0,,"A very poor experience in contrary to online reviews. We booked every thing online to avoid queuing time, and arrived half an hour before the opening hour to be sure. But they told us that the 7:15 and 8:15pm are all sold out, leaving the whole line of people in anger and confusion.
Apparently the whole line has already booked and paid for the tickets online through different agencies, only to be told that we all have to wait for almost 2 hours at the entrance before entering. Note that there is NO WAY anyone could have avoided this, they also never warned about this in any sense online.
Come if you want to wait for 2 hours even if you had paid for the tickets!"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"We joined hundreds of others, lining up for the safari train, but were pleasantly surprised how good it was. The train moved slowly through the dimly lit animal enclosures, giving us excellent close up views of a huge range of animals.
We had paid a taxi to go all the way to the zoo, but discovered there is an excellent, cheaper, shuttle bus service to a range of spots in the city. This was not at all clear from their very poor website."
,,Great to be able to go to a zoo at night!,4.0,,"Despite the crowds, we managed to see everything we wanted to see. Helped that we didn't have young kids in tow - teenagers easier (good to know that they can be easier at least some of the time!! ! ;-)). We chose the 8.15 entry, went straight to the show rather than waiting for a tram. Then we did a walk around our chosen trails (mostly targeted the big cats). By then the trams were pretty much empty & no queues. Same for getting a drink, though we had a real fruit shake that took a while to make. Very nice & refreshing though! We left around 11pm. Plenty of taxis to whizz you back to your hotel."
,,A different zoo view,4.0,,"We had heard ‘horror’ stories from other tourists about transport to and from the night safari, we just walked up to the tour office at Suntec bought entry and bus tickets, lined up at 6.15 and got on the bus,return trip was just as easy, wait at bus Bay 2 at 9.40 and get on the bus...easy. I found it a little hard to see a lot of the animals from the tram tour but a very interesting commentary, plan to do a bit of walking up and down hills (not steep) if you want better views of the animals also flash photography is not allowed so I’d suggest a camera with hand held night settings. I think the zoo next door was better value but still worth a look"
,,Complete misery,1.0,,"Save yourselves and don’t make the mistake of coming to this place. Here’s how it goes:

1) Buy overpriced tickets
2) Stand in line for 2 hours in the disgusting Singapore heat.
3) Ride on a tram in the dark with barley visible animals hiding in the bushes while a Singaporean Vanna White wannabe attempts to convince you that everyone is having a great time.
4) Wait another 30 mins is line for taxi.

Only upside is that you will leave this place stronger and more able to deal with misery and standing in stress positions. I’m no longer afraid of even the worst airport security line. I have survived The Night Safari."
,,Brilliant Night out for the Familt,5.0,,Great experience for the Kids. Well organised and great Zoo. Just the right length for young Children
,,"Great Concept, be prepared to stand in line!",5.0,,"We thought we would slip in and out of the Night Safari on a single night stop over in Singapore, which was a mistake. It's important to understand that they only let people into the Night Safari on set time-frames. They have a show at 7.15, 8.15, 9.15 & 10.15 (might even be an 11.15) ... so if you arrive late, and the earlier sessions are booked out, you are pushed to the later one. Not that this is a bad thing, but if you're not prepared for it then you will spend a lot of time standing around waiting if your not aware. We got there at 7.30pm only to find out that the 7.15 & 8.15 sessions were already sold out so we could not enter until 9.15.
Once you get in, it's great. There is a show that you watch and then catch a tram around the entire Zoo watching the animals. Our tram consistently moved along the track, many animals were visible if not actually standing by the road side in full view. The lines are pretty normal by the looks, so you queue up to enter at your allocated entry time and then queue up for the Show and then you queue up again for the Tram. We weren't really our own best friends at this place, we were tired & it was late and we really didn't experience much more than this - but what we did see we loved!"
,,Enjoyed night safari,4.0,,Worth the nocturnal ride . First time had been to a night safari and we enjoyed it. Skip pet show and do safari
,,its a unique concept,4.0,,you see the animals in the dark with a bit of aritificial lighting. There are shows as well in parallel and we just happened to see one of the shows-on nocturnal animals....but I was told there is a tribal dance show which we missed. The tram ride to see the animals in their habitat in dark was also ok
,,family after dinner trip,5.0,,fun-filled adventure with kids! The tram ride was fun... priority given to elderly and pregnant ladies... keep up the good work!!!
,,I expected more animals. Train trip too long for young children,3.0,,"A lot of spaces were empty, whiteout animals while the speaking says “look at your right/your left...” And the children were tired for expect animals who finally don’t appear"
,,Great Exposure,5.0,,"Feel the natural environment, very close to little animals. Able to see the big animals in an exciting but safe way."
,,A night at the night Zoo,4.0,,"We visited the night Zoo in July this year, humid certainly but easily bearable. The Zoo is well organised and very well sign posted. If you go to the night zoo show do not sit near the edge as you miss most of the show, aim for the middle of the seating area. The tram ride through the Zoo is worth doing, as it gives you a bearing of the Zoo's layout. Then follow up wth the many structured walks. Once you do the night Zoo you will want to come back and do the day time tours. Give yourself at least 2 - 3 hours."
,,Amazing evening!,5.0,,Great evening/night. We went with my 10 year old whom we thought was ready for the long night. We arrived for the 830pm entry and did the walking route which took about 2 hours. Then we took the tram. It is the best way to see the zoo as you get different animals on each of them and the tram rounds it off fantastically. The park closes at midnight and we were there until 1130pm so perfectly timed!
,,Excellent Place To Visit,5.0,,"This is a must-go if traveling to Singapore. Be sure to purchase the ticket (online) first prior to park arrival. So no need to wait in line when arrive. Plus, the tickets are sent to your email when purchasing online. Just have your phone ready and enjoy the ride at night safari."
,,Boring,2.0,,It was so boring and a waist of money and time! We had to wait in line for 1:30 to reach to the show and finally 70% of animals were not visible
,,it was hardly worth the 40$,3.0,,"the ride was rather short, and the show was nothing much. daytime zoo is a lot more fun than that. Also, the wait for the q is quite long."
,,Singapore Zoo's perfect show stopper,5.0,,"Singapore Zoo holds so many exciting things to do. My favourite of then has to be the Night Safari. In the quiet and dark of night, take a face to face ride with the animals in the wild, uncaged and being themselves. This 30 minute adventure is absolutely awe inspiring."
,,Night Safari visit on 16th July 2018,3.0,,We were waiting long time to got tramp service. This night safari trip also short time period to visit wild animals.
,,Terrible Experience,1.0,,This is the first time we went to Singapore and main reason was night safari. But when we went we had really bad experience. It was hot and long line for check in. The park tour was 30-40 minutes and not too many interesting animals to see. The food court was terrible and super expensive. They are serving Indian food which is not even can be considered Indian. Cocktail prices are super high. I had two kids and we travel all over the World. I asked my kids how was the experience and they said
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Its a nice place to see animals in their natural place at night. Its around about 15 mins by car and goes in groups starting from different times. After that there is a nice show. Overall a different experience to be close to animals at night.
,,It’s ok at best,3.0,,"The trip itself is ok, we booked on the 7.15pm tram, yes it’s expensive yes it’s very very busy but You do get to see all of the animals. The food court area is a rip off but there is nowhere else to go so they got a captive market.
We took a cab from the city and back which was $25 sing each way which is quicker than the MRT and quite reasonable. We didn’t get to see the night show as fully booked unless we wanted to wait around for 1.5hrs. If you haven’t got young kids I’d recommend the later showing as it’s far less busy."
,,Night safari,5.0,,After Safari at the show you still have a chance to interact with some animals . Must to go! Great place to go with family special for kids to understand more about different species like Rhino
,,Memorable fun,5.0,,"We had seen reviews on this place commenting that it was really crowded and time is wasted on queueing up for the tram ride that is an absolute must. We decided to visit on a Monday night. There was still a sizable crowd but manageable. Avoid taking the tram ride, instead walk around the safari first. You can cover everything that way. Had a fantastic time!"
,,Worth it for us,5.0,,"I was hesitant about going to the Night Safari based on the other reviews, but for my teen age son--who likes zoos and animals--and for me, it was a fun and worthwhile experience. We got there at about 8:30 pm on a Monday night in July and it was crowded. But we took the advice of the other reviewers and walked first. The walk wasn't crowded at all, and yeah, there were a handful of exhibits where we couldn't spot the animal, but we were able to spot most of them. We were able to do all but one of the walks in an hour, but we walk fast. By 9:30 pm, there was no line at all for the tram. I was surprised at how close we were able to get to the animals on the walk (Bats!) and on the tram. I thought the price was fair and lower than zoo admissions in the states. We did miscalculate one thing. I thought that there was a 10:30 pm Creatures of the Night show, but since it was a weeknight, the last show was at 9:30 pm. We missed that, but it wasn't a big deal."
,,Crowd management needs improvement,3.0,,"Even though i love to give 5 star to this attraction but I'm sad to give 3 star as the crowd management is really bad, Especially the tram part where they take visitors to safari. Min waiting time is 15 to 20 min or even more. Annoying part is the staff guys taking photos before ride and asking to choose photo at end of exit, this really makes overall experience a half ripened mangoes sour and sweet. Overall good if photo sessions by staff is removed and better crowd management so as enjoy ride amidst animals."
,,Stressed out animals and blabbering visitors.,2.0,,"The night safari is greatly overadvertized. The cat animals seemed very much stressed out going continously the same circular route. The visitor on the train stand up blocking your view, talk with a loud voice and use flash photography despite repetitious verbal and written bans. The Berlin zoo is much better. Singapore zoo seems to be designed for the interests of the tourists and not the animals."
,,Enjoyable but shame about the shuttle bus,4.0,,"Great experience, and a complete one off seeing animals in the dark. Khatid Shuttle bus was unlike other transport in Singapore as disorganised at best and no ticket sales at either terminus especially given it is such a cheap price (1 S$). They really should run the shuttle later than 10:40pm as the Night Safari is still open at that time, and consider using larger or more frequent buses during busy periods."
,,Bad experience,1.0,,Totally waste of money. Took the tram for less than an hr. Was told the night show was full and ask to leave. Great disappointment for my kids..
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Not as good as we thought, a day at the zoo would have been better for the kids. The walks were good but not many animals to see on the drive around."
,,Long queue for the tram,3.0,,The queue for the tram was super long and we had to line up for 1 hour+ even though it was a Sunday evening
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. Quite a queue for the tram ride, but goes quick and worth it. Also took a stroll around after the tram, more of a close up experience for some of the smaller animals."
,,very good,5.0,,the light of the place must be further more so that animal can be more visible to the people . the rest all the things is ok
,,Interesting and different take on the the zoo experiance,4.0,,"It was a very interesting experience see the animals in the dark, especially the carnivores. didn't manage to do the walk about. Go for the animal show first then head for the tram ride tour around the compound then slowly walk and see the different enclosures.

Make sure to bring insect repellent, portable fan and water. The mosquitoes can get quite annoying."
,,A Lot of Deer,3.0,,"The Tour was quite good however the guides were constantly talking throughout the Tour and as such couldn't understand the automated recording explaining about the animals. There were some great animals including Lions, elephants etc, but mostly deer"
,,Night at the night safari,3.0,,"Overall a good experience however some of the operations logistics needed improvement. With so many folks on group tours, as an FIT traveler, it seems a little overwhelmingly. Trams pickup is only at main station, which is not kids friendly as the walk is far if you choose to see the animals up close. While standing in line for the, it would have been nice if the fans have misters."
,,Hot and humid,3.0,,"It was very crowded and warm when we visited as there were just too many people. The management should have provided some fans for the crowd waiting to enter. We could not enter because the safari needed to clear the crowd at the tram area. In the end, we decided to explore the trails on foot, which sort of compensated for the unhappiness at the entrance area. Hope that the management could take the suggestion of having more fans at the turnstiles area to cater to such crowded situations esp on weekends."
,,a true disgrace to its own country,1.0,,"no need to elaborate more on its svc and price...not worth the value ..not worth the visit..hot warm mosqutios ,worst customer svc, worst views... we are so F up with the handler handles the Q and the long time wait..........."
,,A Big Con,2.0,,"It cost $180 for three adults and two children. The crowds were horrific
The lines were incredibly long to get in. We had paid on line and they would not accept code and had to line up again to get paper tickets.
When we finally gat on the train and began our tour at least half of the animals were not visable.
Go in the day time to the zoo it us much better"
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,5.0,,"We had a group of 3 adults and 4 children (ages ranging 5 - 12) for the 7.15pm timeslot. After realising we had cut time short to catch taxis in Singapore peak time half the group got in a Grab car (just like Uber) & the other half got in a taxi. The short version is we entered to zoo late for our booked time but they were very accommodating & we were still able to enter. There were long lines for the open vehicles that take you around the zoo, but the lines moved relatively quickly and it was well worth the wait. They make it feel like the animals were within hands reach and sometimes they actually were without feeling unsafe. Highly recommend - just leave plenty of time for peak traffic - not so much the traffic but the ability to be able to find an available taxi."
,,Poor crowd management spoils the enjoyment,3.0,,"Poor transport connections to the zoo, the night zoo transfer bus from metro is terrible, not frequent, old buses and slow. Public bus are better options. The queues for park tram are horrendous, you wait up to 1hr standing in the humidity. Poor signage for people waiting for their zoo session which means they congregate around park entrance making it harder for other visitors to walk past to get to their session. The night zoo would be great if they could deal with the crowds, it does limit the enjoyment. My recommended tip is pay for earliest session and then walk around instead for a couple of hours and get park tram later at 9pm, hardly any line ups after that time."
,,Worth going,3.0,,"If you are in Singapore.. the night safari at Singapore Zoo, going for the night safari is a must. The tickets cost SD 47 for an Adult and SD 31 for a child. The Night Safari starts at 7:15pm till 12 pm. They take you on a tram where you can witness how different animals act after the sun goes down and if you are lucky you can come close to deers walking on the tram track. The tram ride is almost 30 minutes but the best part is the walking track where you can see the animals more closely and clearly. Just make sure you are wearing comfortable shoes but by foot its a must. Would have been even better with a few monkeys exhibit, but worth going"
,,Mr Hemant Patel,5.0,,"Very nice trip to The Night Safari.
I would recommend to get their early because the later you get there the longer the Line to get in. About 6.20 for the 7.15 start. The Night Safari is very good for the whole family.
All staff very helpful"
,,Way too crowded. It was disappointing,1.0,,We went to the night zoo. The crowds were ridiculous. It spoiled the whole night having to line up for hours to get if for a start and then once you are in it is difficult to get around due to the crowds. It was a pity because without the crowd it looks like it might be a good zoo. we left within 40 minutes because it wasnt enjoyable.
,,Great place but NOT on weekends,5.0,,Definitely do the night safari but avoid Fri-Sun. Buy tix in advance online and use kiosk to check for a safari time once there. Be careful: animal area close at about 6 except for special safaris and such. Queues for night safari was an hour—even with reserved time.
,,Nice evening trip,4.0,,"A nice evening activity no Singapore.

Bought tickets online through headout send they were great. Book at least 30 mins in advance you make sure to have tickets.
Get a grab car using app to get here.

If you arrive before 715 is better as you have to pick up tickets and select an entry time slot. This is important.

Take a water bottle to fill.

There are lots of restaurants if you walk fight in.

Once in queue up for creatures of the night show 35-40 mins before. If you miss the first one, wait to take the tour in the car/buggie. Instead go on foot and come back early. After the show these queues will be less."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I’m a biologist and animal lover; this experience was amazing. So interesting getting to be driven through the animals’ exhibits at night. Tour guides speak excellent English and the whole thing is great
,,Unforgettable experience at Night Safari,5.0,,"I visited night safari on the same day after Singapore Zoo and River Safari. This was long awaited trip for me whereby I roamed in the area by walk, and heard sounds of animals. Sky was clear at night and must watch lion feeding during night."
,,night safari visit on weekdays(wednesday),5.0,,"this place is amazing for he first timer.....Contrary to the reviews, i had a very pleasant experience...
planning the trip....
well, i just booked it online..and just had to proceed to the kiosk for the ticket by entering the collection code on the e-ticket. you skip the queue if you made an online booking.
Reached the place at 7:30,got the ticket from the main counter near singapore zoo.
FIRST THINGS FIRST
the first thing you do is go for the CREATURES OF THE NIGHT SHOW. I reached the place at 8:00 and waited for half an hour...I felt it was worth the wait..as the queue for the tram was long.I got the best seat (center)..recommend coming here first for this reason.the right and left corners is to avoid.the show was great...very entertaining if it's your first show of the kind. you see the animals so close...overall very good show..not to miss this one......
WHAT I SAW
Amazing host....got to see lot of funny acts by the animals.....owls..rangoons, hyena, much more...stars of the show: the python and the otters
BE A GOOD GUEST..
no flash photography and parents please watch your kids as the show is all about animals and donot try to touch the animals....
THEN we were guided to the tram at 9:00 which was a wait of 5-10 minutes and this was fine as the crowd was vacating very fast.i enjoyed the tram ride...a guided tour , i recommend you have your headphones handy if you looking forward to any language other than English as the tour was guided in English. there are jacks for other languages in front of your seat.
this is approx 40 minute ride, very exciting...saw a lot of animals...not to miss:malayan tapirs,white lions,bongos, sloth bear, clouded leopard and chamaung..
eventually the walking trails....you could even grab a bite during these walks as the restaurants are in the vicinity....all have to be explored the fishing cat trail, the walaby trail, the east lodge trail and the leopard/lion look out....it's a memorable experience with family....
quick tips:
stock up your snacks as you may be hungry,walking shoes are a must...cheapest and easiest mode to travel is bus....drops you straight to the zoo.....
have a lovely trip..."
,,Must do with Kids,4.0,,"If you are traveling with Kids, its a must do activity. Make pre arrangements for travel as it is far from City."
,,Great Value,3.0,,We were looking forward to riding the tram but there were not much animals that night even though weather permits.
,,Night Safari hard to see,2.0,,"Because it is designed to show the nocturnal animals in a natural setting, this ended up being a disappointment for us. The entire safari was via tram and while they provided a lot of good information on the animals, seeing them in the dark is very hard to do.

We do understand why it must be like this, but didn't factor that in when purchasing tickets for it.

Be aware that the zoo closes at 6pm, so if you elect for a 9:15pm Night Safari ticket you will need to figure out what to do with your time while you wait. The times are NOT changeable after you purchase the ticket but they will attempt to accommodate if there is room left in the earlier time slots."
,,Super crowded - not like in the past,2.0,,"I used to rave about the Night Safari to all my foreign visitors. YOU MUST go there. It’s AMAZING. It’s one of those things I was so proud of in Singapore.

My husband’s nephews came for a visit - all the way from LA. And we were so excited to show them the Night Safari.

To our disappointment, this has turned into another money-grabbing operation.

The foodcourt (I repeat it’s a FOODCOURT not restaurant) charged us $20 each for our meals which are simple chicken rice sets or chicken tikka which we had to queue and get ourselves. Like in any regular foodcourt. We were a family of 5 so we pretty much had a $100 food court meal.

We didn’t mind paying the price of the Night Safari tickets for 5 as we felt this would be awesome. Till we were faced with the HUGE CROWDS entering. The queue for the tram was never-ending. We would have wasted an hour of the time we had just queuing for the tram.

It was never like this 3-4 years ago. We could just queue for 10 mins and get into a tram.

We decide to forgo the tram which was such a shame as a whole section of the park was only accessible by tram.

We went on foot. And crowds were EVERYWHERE we walked. It was like walking in a busy mall on a weekend. Bodies everywhere. People cramming their faces to the glass display to see the animals. It was so so so unpleasant.

I’m so sad - cos I loved the Night Safari so much. I know they’ve restricted ticket entries to certain timings, but IMO could use more restriction.

I don’t think I’ll be going back till this gets better. So disappointed."
,,Worth a try!,4.0,,It is a must visit. However we thought it will take longer (takes about 30 minutes) than that but it was a great experience seeing the animals and the audio was very informative.
,,Prepare to queue!!,3.0,,"I must confess to be disappointed. The queue for the tram was long, I think they could have put entertainment on for those in the queue (similar to when you also queue for tickets). The tram ride was ok, yet marred by guests who could not understand English and therefore continued to use flash cameras despite being told repeatedly in English not to do so.
I felt for the animals as it appeared they had little space to roam and therefore appeared stressed."
,,Nothing exciting,2.0,,it is hard to see animals clearly in the dark... it is not worthy of the ticket and waiting time ...
,,Highly overpriced,2.0,,"The tour is highly overpriced, was just sitting on a train for appr 50 mins. The audio guide is good, but still the experience we got was far away from expectations 😢 sorry, wasn’t happy"
,,Great Service,5.0,,"Must compliment the service levels. Through my own fault, I missed the date of my pre-purchased ticket entry time - I had mixed up my days. I contacted them that evening, and the next day they sent me an email confirming I could use the tickets the next day, which was very generous on their part."
,,too dark,3.0,,"as it is getting dark, hard to see the animals. suveniours are good meals are not bad for their price."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Great experience, great staff, great for young kids especially the 7.30pm show. Would recommend to all who visit Singapore"
,,Not worth it,1.0,,"Too many people are allowed in. The animal show line was 40 minutes and there no seats for our small group. The line to ride a tram was ridiculous. Actual entertainment time, 1 hour. Time waiting 4 hours. Never again."
,,Great deals,4.0,,"My kids had fun and we took the tramp ride twice, but unfortunately the show was full and I wish there were more time slot for the weekdays."
,,Family trip,5.0,,"Joyful and fun, good experience, just to cloudy and waiting long line for the train will consider to visit again"
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,The way they have organised the show and ride is quite amazing and spectacular. They have a very unique and rare collection of animals. They are well arranged for the people to see them.
,,Don’t believe the negative hype,5.0,,"We had been told that this was ‘just like a zoo but you can’t see anything’

Totally untrue, they cater very well to the nocturnal animals and viewing them is not difficult at all.

They have everything you can imagine and the train is included in most tickets so it’s not tough to move with small children or strollers.. great experience"
,,May be interesting for children,3.0,,"The park is not very interesting. The animal not very many. Because of night and don’t have many light around the park, we can’t even see the animal clearly. Most of them hiding, sleeping or facing their back. So mostly can’t see clearly what is it. Only hearing the explanation while having tram riding. After tram riding we expect can see the animal clearer through the walking trail but it’s dissapointed. The show also not very special. Much more talking about the animal behaviour like we are in a class of animal biology. For me, it’s not worth it with the ticket price and long queque. Singapore zoo is far better then this."
,,"Over priced, over crowded, poor show",2.0,,"Short version: falls far short of the hype

Full review: I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with the night safari. We had very limited time on the island and this was very highly recommended. The crowds and the entry ticket prices are very high .
There really was nothing special in terms of the animals you see or the tram ride at night. It is a tram ride through the zoo with the animals dimly lit with fluorescent light.
You might as well see the animals in full brightness of day . We had to wait in line for 60 minutes to get on the tram .
The Creatures of the night show was not very impressive either. The show hosts made their best effort to make it informative and amusing, but it did not live up to the hype . We had seats on one end of the stadium and we could not see a number of the animals - very poor stadium design"
,,Great experience,4.0,,The night safari is interesting and fun. However one should aware of the arrangement of public transport as less choice available.
,,Waste of time for what could be great,2.0,,"Why actively promote that people should book their tickets online, when you then have to stand in line for over 70 minutes to actually collect your tickets! Absolute chaos and waste of time. Why can't my online booking be my ticket? Then you wait a further 40 minutes to get on the tram to take you around the zoo. This was quite impressive with most animals being active (that prevents me giving it a terrible rating). Had I known though how much hassle this place is I would not have gone."
,,Great!,5.0,,My husband and I went to the night safari and had a great time! We don't have kids so tried to avoid the crowds. We bought the 8:15 ticket but went straight for the walking trails to avoid the tram queue. I was amazed at the animals we saw. They were much more energetic at night! We did the tram around 11 and there was no line. It was nice doing the trails and the tram as they offer different views and information. Great time!
,,First Time to Night Safari,3.0,,"Feel excited but really HOT...HOT..HOT when queue for Tram, the queue is long and the place of waiting is very hot and stuffy like no open air even the place are an open space waiting area."
,,Worth a look!,4.0,,6 adults- bought the tix on line through the concierge at our hotel on the same day - got a bit of discount doing it this way! Did the 8.15 show as the 7.15 was already booked out! Was pretty busy but really didn’t have to wait too long! We got there about 1/2 hour early - probably waited another 20 mins before the creatures of the night show started! We unfortunately sat in the wrong place and missed a few of the items of the show as the trees obscured our view!! Tip - don’t sit on far right (looking at the stage). We went straight out and lined up for the safari straight after this and only waited about 5-10 mins to get on the tram! The tour was good and we had a good view of all the animals! Worth a look - would be great for families with kids! I read reviews before we went and was expecting longer waiting times! But we were pretty lucky! I can see that it might get pretty hectic at times though! A risk you take I guess!
,,Disappointed trip,2.0,,The waiting time for tram ride is too long. Whole trip only manage to take tram ride and not many animals...
,,Average but not worth the money,3.0,,Long queue for the tram as well as the show. Waste of time queuing up and it was worse when raining...
,,Very Enjoyable,5.0,,"Went with family and they really enjoyed seeing all the different animals, bout a 3 day Singapore visitor pass in advance which I highly recommend"
,,A complete waste of time - Dont spend your cash to go there. Tourist trap. Boring.,1.0,,"Huge queue to jump on a tram. Surrounded by noisy Chinese tourists that for some reasons kept shouting at each other while waiting. We were then hoping to have a quiet time on the train that takes us around the night safari. Unfortunately we were blasted with horrible music and boring pre-recorded commentaries along the ride. We were hoping for a pleasant ride but it was noisy and the seats rather uncomfortable (some kind of PVC which gets hot and sticky in tropical Singapore.

When we had to look at animals, we actually had to look for animals. It is indeed dark and animals are not waiting by the noisy train to be spotted. So basically you cant see anything. Whats the point to do this expensive ride if one cant see anything. Actually most of the train passengers were on their phone chatting after realizing that there was nothing to see. Whatever you may be able to spot is surely not worth any of queuing time and crazy expensive tickets. My kids were disappointed at the end of the 30' ride, I was relieved that this torture was ending. We took a SGD 50 taxi to go back to town and called it a night.

The night safari promises a lot. It is indeed very well-branded and beautifully marketed but the actual visit is a dead boring and not worth the SGD 250 my family had to pay.

I dont think the Night Safari is a nice way to end your day at the Zoo (which is in contrast a lot better than the Night Safari) nor is the night Safari a worthwhile attraction on its own. Their team must revised the price and the attraction. Otherwise it will stay a tourist trap for unsophisticated tourists.

PS: to top it all...there were tons of mosquitoes !!"
,,Really enjoyed it,4.0,,Our group was nervous going into the night with all the poor reviews- we were honestly thinking of missing it and I am so glad we didn't. We purchased the park hopper ticket (without the tram rides) so we didn't do the tram ride on the night. We booked for 7.15pm entrance. We went in about 7.30 after reading reviews to wait a little longer. That made such a difference as the lines started building at 6.30. We walked straight in at 7.30. We found the tracks easy to do at night and got to see the lions and tigers being fed. The zoo has an excellent range of nocturnal animals who were all on the move when we visited. We will be back!
,,Great night on Safari,5.0,,"Booked online the same day directly with a 5% discount and had such a great night. Not only seeing the animals within such a great setting but also learning about the so many different animals and the battle against extinction.
It was busy but the queues move and after the main tram ride it was time to take the 4 walks to get really close to the animals.
It really is a must do when in Singapore with or without kids."
,,Waste of time & money,1.0,,"Night Safari is a complete waste of time and money for tourists. The location of night safari is far away from main city, usually takes around a hour or more to get there. Night safari includes a show which could be some what said the best part of the safari. After the 30 min show you can go on a free tram ride of night safari. The driver keeps telling information and details about the animals passing by in cages. Most of the animals aren't visible due to low lightning and some animals are said to be sleeping. In short you take a small ride through a forest of about 20 minutes of airport carts. Wouldn't recommend doing night safari but would be fun for people getting to know nature & animals more deeply."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,My daughter and I booked the tickets online. Entry was smooth. There was a 10min wait for the tram ride though. Lots of people even though we were on time. We were able to go for the 8.30pm animal show after the tram ride.
,,Zoo can't cope with the amount of people,2.0,,"We booked online and paid $31 for our 9.15pm entrance tickets.

We got to the night safari entrance at 8.30pm and discovered a massive que. Before joining it we checked with a member of staff who told us we had to go to the main ticket office to exchange our eticket to a physical one.

Queued for 15 mins, then we got the pleasure of joining the massive que to the entrance. We got into the park at 9.20, to find another massive que in front of us for the tram.

We looked to see if we could get into the 9.30pm show.. It was full.

Joined the tram que, at 10pm we could hear and smell the fire show which for some reason is outside the entrance to the park and not to entertain the poor people who had now been in a que for now over 45mins.

We eventually got on a tram at 10.20pm, so no chance of seeing the last show at 10.30pm

The safari is fairly lame, you don't get long enough to look at the animals, and there is a little to much info being played through the sound system to enjoy the sound of the animals.

After the tram ride we went on a trail walk. Now this is great! Lots of information, nice paths, good viewing of the animals. Unfortunately this was also ruined for us as at 11.40 we had staff chasing us out of the park, and many animals had been put away or the area was closed. We thought we would be able to buy a drink at the cafe at the halfway point on the trail...also closed.

This place could be wonderful, but unfortunately we queued nearly for 1.5 hours for a rushed hour looking at the animals. The Zoo allows to many people into the park and they simply don't have enough trams or sitting capacity for the amount of people who attended.

If you do go, I would highly recommend buying the fast pass tram ticket and getting to the zoo at 7pm to enjoy it."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"After going through the zoo, we were a little worried how much the night safari would bring to the experience but it was amazing! We were in the 7:15 time slot, which is easily the busiest. People started lining up at 6:00, and that was just the line to check your ticket before getting in line to have your ticket scanned. Word of advice: there is one line to start with, after a staff member checks the ticket the line splits four ways. When we were there everyone stayed in the same line even though other lines said to enter, which worked out for us because we went in another line and were second in that line instead of being 30 or so people from the front. After entering most people ran to the night show, we rode the tram first and then watched the show after and didn’t have any issues. I recommend also doing the walking trails. The tram takes you to animals you can’t see on the walk, but the walking trails allow you to take your time and walk through some exhibits. Parts of the trail are quite dark though, so it could be scary for small children or anyone who is afraid of the dark."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"I was expecting a lot from the night safari given the way it is promoted and also given the number of people going to this. For $47 each I would have hoped to see more wildlife. There were lots of deer and a few other animals that were hard to see in the semi dark. The time to get there, the queues, the noise , and the whole theme park atmosphere turned me right off. Plenty of better things to do in Singapore."
,,Very entertaining,5.0,,This is a very novel concept for a zoo. It was Ana amazing experience to take a tour similar to a Safari at night and see all of the animals in their nocturnal state. It is fun for both kids and adults alike. I definitely recommend going here especially if you are visiting with your family and have kids of all ages
,,Experience can go either way,3.0,,"Firstly the queues: The queues and waiting times for the tram (as many others have also pointed out) can be very long. There is absolutely no way to skip the lines. We had booked the 8:15 PM entry but we were still waiting in the queue at 9 PM. After spending whole day at the zoo, it certainly wasnt a pleasant experience waiting in the queue for a tram ride. The thumbuakar performance provided some entertainment and respite while waiting in the queue.

Next the tram: Unlike the main zoo, trams can only be taken at the starting point. During our visit we were not allowed to take the tram from middle. The tram goes by only selected animals, so one has to be on foot to see rest of the animals.

Now the review: After being tired of just standing in the queue for more than an hour we decided to see everything on feet (possibly the best decision we made). We could see almost all the animals at our own pace. For example while on feet we saw the whole lion pride but when on tram we only saw one lion.

After about 2 hours when we returned to the starting point, there was no queue for the tram so we decided to jump in and take the tour again by tram.

Flash photography will scare the animals so unless you have a good night vision camera that takes good photos in dark, forget about taking picture and enjoy the ride.

Lastly, finding wash rooms and drinking water was very difficult."
,,Can visit kind of place,3.0,,"As the name suggests, i was very thrilled to visit Night Safari but after my visit i will rate it as AVERAGE. Its just a kind of time pass in dark with not much to gain."
,,Enjoyed the animals but queues too long,3.0,,"We arrived at 6.45 (when gates open). It was suggested that we go straight to the 7.15 Creatures of the Night show (there was no queue for tram at this time). After the show we then went to get the tram and had to wait an hour. This was ridiculous and unpleasant. Tickets are sold for time slots, but it seems to me that too many tickets have been sold. Unfortunately, we did not have the option of walking as one of us was unable to. Suggestion would be to get the tram, if the queue is short, or go at a later time.
On the positive side, we enjoyed the tram ride (once we were on it ) and it was great to hear all the environmental and conservation messages."
,,A must go attraction,5.0,,"Worth a visit, an eye opening attraction. But make sure u have good eyesight at night. Eat more carrots"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"If you can, prefer the 9.15pm or 10.15pm slots. Less queue. But very nice experience anyway. The train is going slowly, this way you have time to look after the animals. The kids can enjoy. Next time I should try to walk... but probably without kids!"
,,Review,2.0,,Not worth the money. Queue was too long at stipulated timed ticket. Attraction can hardly be seen. Crowd management can be improved.
,,"Could be a good experience, but tickets oversold",1.0,,"We arrived at 7.45 for the 8.15 timeslot, after cuing for an hour and a half we finally got in, only to be faced with yet another cue for the tram. From arrival to getting on the tram it took us about 2 hours!!!

The tram ride was good and we were able to see many of the animals. I think walking around the park though would have been a better experience as we wouldn’t have had to listen to the commentary of others on the tram. It was after 10 by the time we completed the tram ride by which time we had had enough, so exited the park – only to be faced with another cue to get a taxi which took over an hour. All in all we spent maybe 30 minutes in the park and over 3 hours in lines.

Horrible and expensive night for what you pay. Would not recommend."
,,Don’t waste your time,1.0,,"If I could I would give this a no star review. This is our last park from a 4 day park trip. River safari, the zoo and the bird park were fantastic. I have been waiting in a tram queue for an hour and it looks like a further 30 mins of waiting. Everyone is unhappy. It’s noisy. It’s not a weekend or public holiday. The people working here are clearly not happy either. It’s a mess and a huge disappointment. The other parks were special. This is a dismal failure. I was here 15 years ago and enjoyed it. Clearly capitalism and commercialism have proved the undoing of this park. Night safari you really need to do better"
,,Extremely disappointing,1.0,,"I have been to the Night Safari quite a few times before. We visited the night safari in the last week of June 2018. The weather had been erratic for Singapore - rather wet instead of the dry spell that it often is in June, so we decided to book our tickets only when there would be no chance of rain(ie. the day itself). In our party were 6 adults and a child. We were visiting Arab Street and saw cheaper tickets for the Night Safari being sold at a hotel tickets for that same day). We decided to book our tickets there. Unfortunately, there was only the 9.15 slot available. Never having heard of time slots for the night safari, I was rather surprised, but decided to go ahead as we were taking family around and it was their last couple of days in Singapore. In the process of booking the tickets, we realised that we could not book the child's ticket. So after having paid for the 6 adults, we went online and saw that there were tickets available for the 7.15pm slot!!! I ended up booking the child ticket for that time slot and we decided to go early to the Night Safari and try our luck.
We got there at 8.45pm. I explained our situation. They were gracious enough to let us in earlier as a gesture of goodwill. After getting sorted, we decided to queue for the show. That was a huge mistake. We waited in line for the show - we were the first in the queue. The show started at 9.30 and ended at 10 pm (30 mins). Then we decided to take the tram - it was just outside the the entrance where the show was. We waited for a bit and after our tram ride (it was rather dark, we mainly saw different species of deer (layman's terms!), we decided to do the walking trail. Halfway through our trail, we had to turn back (11.45pm). The Night safari was closing, so we did not get the see the rest of the place!!! We didn't even complete the Fishing Cat trail!! So we didn't even complete ONE trail. Extremely miffed, after all, the tickets aren't cheap, I decided to approach the counter staff at the entrance.

I explained our situation. They eventually let us go back to the Night Safari on another night, for free to complete the other trails. Unfortunately, two people in our group could not go back though - due to the time constraint.

I did ask them why they sold tickets which only allowed people to go at 9.15 and was told (to my horror) that there was even a later slot. They did say that there are some people who go there JUST for the tram ride or just to do a walk or just to say been there, done that, with photos to prove.

So.....If you want to go to the Night Safari, there are couple of things to remember...

1) Only go if you are not averse to crowds. It IS very crowded.
2) Book in advance and get the earliest slot possible.
3) If you are on a tight budget and don't have much time, skip this Singapore attraction.
4) If you really want to ""experience the place"", set aside the whole night for the hours.
1-2 hours won't be enough.
5)If you are in Singapore only for a short period of time but want to do either the Night Safari or the zoo, do the zoo."
,,Try your luck,4.0,,"The night safari by itself is a great idea and a brilliant place to visit. The problem is your luck: the animals may or may not be out. Most of the times they are lurking in the shadows, and even when they're out, the lighting isn't very bright.

We took the tram ride that took us throughout the park. There were tigers, bears, wolves, elephants, among others that we saw. But it was mostly luck, as I wrote earlier."
,,Big area .. less fun,2.0,,"Hi all friends
We visited here with kids . Very crowdy and noisy . People were qued up for their turn to sit in the tram . In tram they cover the whole area .. they slowed down and stopped when the animals appear on the way . Very dark ..only little glimpses of the animal . No Fun in it guys ..Mean I suggest people to spent there time and money in some other places in Singapore.
Thanks"
,,Nice but very very busy,3.0,,We loved the cute night show but the line for the tram ride thing was ridiculous!!!!! We waited in line in the heat for about 2 hours.... which is a joke. Crowd control needs to be organised better... would not recommend.
,,Night safari stampede,4.0,,"Enjoyed going on the night safari with a billion other people which made walking over doing the shuttle lines, our preferred option. Interactive show was entertaining & it was good to see lots of animals “awake” during their nocturnal cycles. Park is expansive & the crowds & our sore feet put us off doing the second side of the zoo though so we ate and joined another long line for a taxi back to our habitat. Highlights for us we’re watching the slow loris find & eat tree sap & watching & listening to the otters recycle rubbish & play- there little voices are the cutest!"
,,Memorable,4.0,,"It was nice to see the show, how well they have presented it and after that tram ride was enjoyable. We walked around entire place to cover all animals, it was fantastic experience to do this Safari in night and yes it's completely safe."
,,Waste of time and money,1.0,,"Booked our tickets online for 9.15 after much difficulty trying to determine when we were meant to see the Creatures of the Night show, there was no information regarding this at all so assumed it would be after the safari.
Got there to find we had to do the safari at 9.15 even though the show was at 9.30, the last for the evening, so we didn’t get to see it.
But the safari was an absolute waste of time and money. There were hardly any animals to be seen. Those that were out, a few deers, were in dark shadowy places and almost invisible.
The constant comment by the guide was, “ It appears they aren’t out tonight”
We complained at reception about no information regarding when to see the Creatures of the Night show and their sloppy uninformative website but all that got little response.
Give it a miss"
,,Great night out,4.0,,This was fabulous for us and our visiting family from Australia. Only issue is people who cannot listen to instruction. Its sad when a 5 year old has to tell adults to turn their flash off.

,,Tourists need to shut up,3.0,,"It was a great experience and all but the amount of foreigners who can't keep their mouths shut makes this a very irritating experience where these terrible tourists talk to much, make noises at the wildlife and constantly take flash photography. This wondeful experience has been tainted by the poor actions of the tourists who are bigger animals than those at the attraction and the lack of control and authority of the staff who made no effort to shut them up or disable their flash."
,,WONDERFUL,5.0,,"If you plan on going to the zoo do the Night Safari Tour. For one, it's cooler at night. Great experience for young and old. If you want to skip the lines, book a tour and you will get priority boarding on the tram ride. If you don't want to book a tour, get there early and be first in line. When you see the lines its a little daunting but it does move along at a good pace. If you don't, then chances are you will be waiting in line for the tram ride which is the highlight and you may miss the times for the shows. Great night"
,,Ok experience,3.0,,"We went at 20:15 , this was an allocated slot but was then told this is only for general admission ! I expected the tram to be ready to take us at 20:15 but instead was told it would take an hour to get the tram due to the crowds !! We walked instead and so no point of taking the tram as we had already seen everything .
Ok experience , wouldn’t recommend ."
,,Still the best night safari in the world,5.0,,"The night safari is indeed a great place to bring the entire family, young and old, where you can learn more, on how to care for animals."
,,Not recommended with young children,1.0,,"Long queue. Not suitable for family with young children. Will not go back again. By the time it's our turn, my kids are already so tired after queuing n didn't enjoy the ride at all. Waste of our time and money"
,,Night safari - great use of tranjsit time,5.0,,Really enjoyed the night safari and tram tour. Reception staff made it an enjoyable experience from the very beginning. Buy your tickets online before you go.
,,Starts off like DisneyWorld,3.0,,"Be prepared when you arrive for everything to be based on DisneyWorld - large crowds, queuing and plenty of eating establishments whilst you wait. Once on the road train (one every 10mins or so) then it reverts to what you are probably expecting. You do see plenty of animals and the non-dangerous ones you can almost touch from the road train. You cannot use a flash on camera, so taking decent photographs is going to need a very good camera. Once in the place you can go on multiple events, so it can end up reasonable value. Staff are friendly and helpful (as they are in almost all of Singapore's attractions). The shuttle bus from Khatib MTR was OK (and just a dollar) but expect a wait either end during busy times. I suggest avoiding weekends."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,It took longer to get to Night Safari via public transport than it took to look around. Couldn’t see a lot cause it was dark. Way overpriced and not value for money. Difficult to get home on public transport - bite the bullet and take a taxi. Wouldn’t recommend.
,,Zoo,1.0,,So terrible cant see animals. Most animals feed them until sleep & sleep. I hope the zoo shld do sometimg as the price is not cheap.
,,Highly Overrated,2.0,,"I must say that it is a highly overrated attraction . This is not a safari in first place . All the animals are either caged or confined on both sides of road and the tram goes through the road.

It never felt like natural to me .. rather a more open zoo which opens at night

Fire show which happens outside the gates is good .

In a nutshell, one time visit with children is ok ."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Enjoy a barmy Singapore evening with a leisurely trolley ride through the zoo. See the animals awake and active, whereas they are generally asleep and hidden during the day.

We found - by chance, not planning, that turning up a little after the advertised start time (7.15, 8.15, etc) avoids some of the crowds and chaos. Everyone gets in, and gets on. There are some eateries to fill in time if needed. The ride goes for about 45 mins, and then if you have time the animal show is worthwhile, although still looked to be developing when we were there. It goes for around 30 mins.

If you have a city sightseeing ticket, they have buses running up and back for transport, which takes around 30-40 mins from city.

All in all an interesting and unique experience that the whole family enjoyed."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"First I would like to thank Trip Advisor for providing an earlier review which was really helpful. We found that although we had got tickets, there was still a LONG queue to enter the Night Safari animal performance. The fire dance was quite entertaining as it helped to pass the time. Watching the animals in the amphitheatre was good and we enjoyed the experience. We then had to queue for an even longer time, to board an open tram for the ride around the night safari. We had thought that the Night Safari involved seeing animals running around at night but we quickly realised that it is actually a drive around certain areas of Singapore Zoo in the dark. It was a very nice experience and the tour guide was excellent. We were pleased to see a range of eating places available, near the exit, providing lots of choice and a range of prices. The Night Safari is definitely worth a visit (as long as you are prepared to stand in long queues) but unlike the Bird Park and the Zoo, it did not make us want to go back for a second visit. We have been to the Bird Park and the Zoo many times and still love going to both places."
,,Unique adventure,4.0,,We’d prebooked the earliest slot for a 7.15pm start. It was very busy upon arrival & best you arrive early & allow plenty of time for this. The staff were well organised to direct you to the “creatures of the night show” to start your adventure off. Lasts about 20-30 mins. Then you’re lead to a queueing line for one of the organised tram tours through the park. We chose to walk instead. It took a while for our eyes to adjust to the dark. We almost felt like we shouldn’t be there - felt like we were walking through a zoo after it was closed with no one there!!! The path lead you past all of the nocturnal animals. Such a different zoo experience & we thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommend it. Would love to visit the other areas of the zoo in the daytime when we go back to Singapore.
,,Great Experience!,5.0,,"We a family of 5 came to the night safari in June 2018. We had prebooked tickets for the 7pm slot, when we arrived we went to the show and then after the show waited 5 minutes for the tram. The tram was longer than expected (in a good way) and was really enjoyable.

After the tram we walked throughout the trails and seen the rest of the park that way. It was very well organised and really enjoyable. We would return."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"Sitting conveniently in an open train, moving through a jungle at night-time in almost dark and watching wild animals like hyenas, lion, rhinos etc is surely an enticing event. Add to that, the shows conducted were gripping and entertaining. Nature lovers should definitely visit."
,,Night with the animals,3.0,,A good place to see animals in the night but the visiblity was very less most of the animals are not to be seen clearly however the commentry regarding the animals were on so we could understand what is there in here.
,,How to address inappropriately behaving visitors on train safari ??,3.0,,"It’s a shame that there’s no customer service support on the train of the safari for rowdy or inappropriately behaving visitors.
Even before the train takes off, the driver or guide won’t say a word about not using flash photography or being considerate to other visitors on the train, like being quiet on the tour.
Me and my friend were sitting in front of the 3 grown up Indian adults who nonstop kept talking while the tour was going on. Even we tell them to tone it down, they didn’t care. ( it’s not about excited kids who tend to talk louder; it’s about rowdy adults who don’t give a flying .... about others and that really should be addressed)
Now, for one, we can’t choose the seats, second we can’t get off the train whenever we want and thirdly there should be a way that your visitors can notify the driver or guide of incidents or inappropriately behaving visitors on the train.
For example the animal show host can come on 5 min earlier and give a very entertaining briefing about do’s and dont’s. at least shes done her part: to tell the public to be considerate!!!!
Like in the train station you guys are not even in the rush to get the trains moving, even there’s a 2hr queue and people are tired of standing. Instead of that, you send Photographers to waste even more time before it takes off!? Why ?"
,,Still my favourite attraction in Singapore,5.0,,I must admit I never grow tired of visiting the Night Safari in Singapore. I've actually lost count of the number of times I've visited! I love everything about it! It's totally wild to be standing next to a leopard when all that separates you is a glass panel!!
,,Wait 2.5hrs for 30minutes,1.0,,"No where to sit while you wait unless you are spending more money on food and drink. Crowds were enormous. It took three queues before getting onto the tram. It was difficult for the kids to see much “wild life”. Staff were extremely unhelpful after injuring myself on a low sign.

Save your money and give it a miss!!"
,,Well executed idea. Worth it!,5.0,,"Originally had my doubts about how well a night safari would be pulled off. In the end, it was a blast! Tons of cool animals from around the world were out and about.

If you don't have kids, I would recommend going later and aim to catch the 2nd or last Tram as it is super busy earlier on. Just start with the walk, catch a late ""creatures of the night"" or lion feeding show and then catch on of the last trams. 100% worth the price of admission!"
,,Great Family activity,5.0,,Attended the night safari after beign at the singapore zoo during the day. The night safari was a nice way to finish off the day. Attending in the evenign was pleasant as the sun disappeared.
,,4 Park Hopper - Family Review,3.0,,"We had taken the 4 Park Hopper and while buying the ticket , we had also booked a time slot of 9.30 PM .Unfortunately we were unable to make it to the venue by 10 PM and i was confused about if we would be able to see the show or have to purchase the tickets again.

Fortunately there were not many people around for the 10.15 slot and the staff said as long as we had the 4 park hopper ticket, it was fine that we could enter in the next slot.

Experience -
The night show got cancelled so for me it turned out to be a ride via a tram for around 30-40 mins in the night.The concept is definitely unique but i did not find it to be worth the visit , especially if you have done the Zoo which has a much more wide range of animals. After around 40 mins tram ride and seeing some of the animals in the dark , we were dropped at the point where we started and that was the end of the Night Safari for us.
* There is absolutely no point in carrying the camera as you would not be able to get any pictures.
* There are plenty of restaurants at the entry and you can get snacks and stuff . Most of it was closed when we left so make sure you have stuff to eat before entering ( if you are going in the 10.15 PM slot )
* Easy to find a taxi to the place and out of the place. An Important Tip - We came in from orchard road and i was first trying to ask the Cabs if they would go towards Night Safari and all of them refused. SO Please get into the cab and then only tell them that you want to go towards the Safari , for some reason the drivers are not that keen on making the drive to that place and if you ask them , they would say no."
,,A must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"I had purchased a Park Hopper pass to visit all four attractions by Wildlife Reserves and must say that my experience at the Night Safari was the best of all parks. The tram rides run in 4 slots separated by an hour starting at 7 PM. I opted for the 8 PM slot after reading over-crowding at the tram stations and must say I was glad I did. The crowd was certainly less despite it being weekend.

The tram ride itself was great with the guide telling us interesting stories about animals there. The fact that some animals would come close to the tram during the ride was thrilling. They also have walking trails in case you're not satisfied with the 15 minute ride and want to watch some animals more closely. The signboards at some places aren't sufficient but the staff on-site are very courteous and helpful making the trek comfortable and hassle free.

One more thing that truly deserves a mention is the Creatures of the Night show at the Night Safari. It is a free show for all Night Safari guests and it's brilliant. If you're planning a visit to the Night Safari, go stop by for this show. This show is the sole reason for my Excellent rating for the Night Safari despite there being some issues. The host of the show knows how to keep the audiences' attention and interest. The animals and birds on display are well trained and pull off some interesting stunts."
,,"Overall is good, but the signboard need to improve.",3.0,,"Overall is good, but the signboard need to improve. Some of the show need to have better direction as we are not taking tram."
,,LADIES NIGHT,5.0,,visiting the Night Zoo is always a pleasure (being local). Have been visiting over the years and each visit is never the same. thank you to the team for all the hard work and immense improvement done. It sure is a pleasant place to visit especially with foreign visitors. its awesome!
,,Great family fun!,4.0,,"What a great evening spent up close with animals! We were fortunate to sit in the front row near the tour guide who had a lot of interesting tidbits to share. The lines were long and the heat was excruciating, but the Night Safari did its best to have high-powered fans and citronella everywhere the line weaved which helped a great deal. I'm not sure I would return, but I would definitely recommend going. Our 7-year-old loved it."
,,Over crowded,3.0,,"Tram system is not efficient. Have to wait a long time in queue cos there's only 1 boarding point for tram. They should adopt the same system as the Singapore Zoo where visitors are able to board and alight the tram at any stop.
Signages at entrance for visitors who want to walk instead of taking the tram are not that clear."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"I'm not a fan of zoos but if I have to choose one to visit, is the Singaporean one. It is amazing how the animals are active and don't have that sad look in the eyes. The Night Safari is amazing and allows you to see nocturnal animals in a way that I'm not sure any other zoo in the world does. The whole atmosphere is amazing, the staff the knowledgable and extremely helpful. The Creatures of the Night show is a must see."
,,nice but a room for improvement for sure,4.0,,"This was my 3rd visit and this time we saw fewer animals. Although it's always enjoyable, the crowd is getting too much and the Zoo needs to do enforce some rules to ensure everyone there has a nice time. The crowd control or fewer tickets sold would be nice."
,,Great fun for all the family,5.0,,"The night safari is a great experience as there are lots of things to see and do. I recommend getting one of the earlier entrances because the creatures of the night show has limited seats and only has 3 showings on weekdays. Therefore if you are unable to get into the first show, you would be able to make it to the second show. You are also able to take a walk around the zoo and see all the animals at night, this is just over an hours walk. The tram ride which takes you around all the larger animals is great fun and the queues go down quickly past 9pm. There are plenty of taxis waiting outside of the night safari entrance to take you back to the city once you have finished."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"On a brief two night stay in Singapore recently, we chose to visit Night Safari, as it had been recommended to us by several people. The safari set-up is amazing! It was an incredible experience to see animals freely roaming in beautiful habitats, and like everywhere in Singapore, it was very clean and well-presented. Our kids were absolutely thrilled to see so many animal species, some of which we had never seen or heard of before. The concept of the tram tour through the habitats was excellent. The only downside was that we visited on a Sunday night and it was extremely crowded and busy. We went to see the animal show first, which was entertaining, but then we had to wait in a long queue for at least an hour to get on a tram. Luckily the tram ride was good, so it was worth the long wait, but if I went again, I would try to choose a much less busy night to attend - especially with the kids in tow. The other negative was that we had arrived by taxi, and when we left, there was an enormous queue at the taxi stand. We were fortunate to find a group of people travelling to the same area as us and we hired a private minibus to our hotel. Without this stroke of good luck though, I imagine we may have been in that taxi line for hours, which would not have been pleasant with two young tired children... Overall, the night safari was impressive and enjoyable, except for the crowds."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,Long queue but totally worth the wait. Good thing that animals were awake. Tram ride was comfortable for the whole duration.
,,A fun night,5.0,,Recently visited Singapore. One evening took in the Night Safari. Fun experience. Interesting to see the animals at night. Caught the animal show after the safari and enjoy it also. If your are ever in Singapore make sure you take the night safari.
,,Hear the tiger's roar in the dark!,4.0,,"Take a walk along the pathways and explore the park! I would not recommend the guided tour by bus: Walking in the dark is certainly more interesting & hearing the tiger's roar makes you hope that you are on the right side of the fence... We booked our tickets for 8:15 pm: Quite a number of animals can already been seen at this fairly early hour, only the otters decided to get up late. Between 2 and 2,5 hours should be plenty of time for a walk around. Don't be surprised by the noisy music at the entrance - there is absolutely no need it but it will subside once you get deeper in the park..."
,,One time is enough,3.0,,For this price I would have expected more than a small round through the zoo. The whole trip was around 40 minutes. Nothing you could not see during the day at the zoo. the only difference is that it's just dark and you cannot take pictures because the light is missing.
,,My sister and the foxes,5.0,,My sister wants to be a fox in her next life after visiting night safari. What an experience ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
,,Worth the effort and money!!,5.0,,"This safari is located at a distance of 25-30kms. from the city area. We opted for a cab ride as it was convenient & time saving.
My wife and I chose the Night Safari over the Zoo as time was a constraint and anyways we were seeing animals, so seeing them at night was our first. And we were elated after the end of our Night Safari in the jungle!!
The tram ride was quite comfortable & a good way to be close to the animals at night. We were lucky to spot all the animals which were pointed out by the tram guide.
To add to the fun we even did the walking trails which were 3 in total ; one leading to another. This brought us even closer to some of the animals. The walk was really thrilling as some of the stretches passed through secluded part ( yet safe)of the forest. And to add to the adventure, we could hear the king of the jungle, the lion roar while we were walking!
The live animal show was good too. Many nocturnal animals were staged in a narrated performance which was hosted by a guy who added lots of comic elements .
Only negative about this experience was that we ended around 12am & by the time we came out most restaurants were close. Had to manage with chips n coke only!
Definitely recommend this safari!!"
,,Best experience,5.0,,This was one of the best experiences my family and I have ever had with animals. Truly amazing to see the animals at night and in their own environment
,,Best for very young children,3.0,,"Our kids loved the night safari when they were 3 and 5 and we thought we’d return on a recent visit to Singapore. They are now 6 and 8 and did not find it as captivating. The show was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. Tram ride was at the same level - just ok. Love the concept, but would I go again....? Doubt it."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"One of the most highlighted activity in tourist list not to be missed as well. The first thing one should do is to book the ticket in advance with preferred time slot to avoid the crowd. We bought the combo package which includes Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari & Jurong Bird Park directly from them online.

Pls do watch the fire show performed every hour before entering to the queue for the Night Safari. It was awesome.

Night safari is something new & amazing experience. The tram ride was awesome. Use of flash light, making noise & getting down off the Tram is STRICTLY PROHIBITED."
,,It's just a zoo in the dark,3.0,,"I was a bit disappointed,the enclosures for the big cats, elephants etc are to small. In reality it's a zoo without lights."
,,Difficult to see most of the featured animals,3.0,,"There is a show that is much better than the tram ride. Because the area os not well-lit to mimic the night time environment, it was very difficult to see the animals or taking pictures of them. I ended up deleting most of my pictures due to them looking too grainy & not able to see much."
,,Overcrowded,1.0,,"I have been to Singapore several times but have never made it to the zoo or Night Safari, despite people telling me how amazing it is. This visit was the moment. We walked to Suntec and organised to get there by bus and booked our admission tickets online for 7.15pm. We got there before 7.00pm and were herded into the Creatures by Night show, half of which we couldn't see because of restricted view. The scramble to leave the auditorium saw us herded like cattle into a queue for a tram with miked up young people instructing us to go here or there stay left or right... it was mayhem and no fun at all. After a while, we realised that we could walk around the park so left the cattle pen and thoroughly enjoyed the walk, despite some rain which added to the atmosphere. We saw some really beautiful leopards which were my favourite. After that we skipped the bus and got a taxi back to our hotel. I'm glad I saw the night zoo but would not rush back. Everything is very out-dated and tired. Enclosures are not that big for some animals and the noisy intrusive commentary from the tram punctuating the night jungle is not good even as you walk on the trails. Having seen how Singapore has innovated at their National Gallery earlier today, I really think they could do better here."
,,Great but overcrowded,4.0,,"Singapore Zoo is a must see itself and one of the best zoos ever visited. The Night Safari offers to explore the nocturnal animals of the zoo both during a tram ride through the djungle and several trails to walk by oneself, which we found an extraordinary experience seeing the animals so close in almost natural habitats.

A major drawback though is that the Night Safari is heavily overcrowded by Indian and Chinese tourists in large groups being extremely noisy and pushing themselves in front especially before and during the tram ride.

We were there on a Monday (one of the least busy days) and entered at 7:15pm. After coming back from the trails at appr. 9:30 most of the crowds were gone, so I recommend entering at a later time."
,,Singapore Night Safari,5.0,,Place is beautiful...but it is very very crowded.. If you cannot walk do take the tram cos there is no interim hop-in-hop-out.. Tram goes one end to the other and no stopping in between.
,,Still a good experience,4.0,,First went here in 2005 and were keen to see if it lived up to the memory. Entry was not well signed for a night venue and was annoyed to rush to get the last show only to be told it was full but the animal exhibits and getting so close to such a range of animals is fabulous so I can’t be too negative. Best to ignore the Night Safari signs and head to the main zoo entry to get tickets before going to the night safari entry. We had 2 hours and would have liked more time to walk the circuit as the tram only gets to some parts.
,,Night Safari Rules!,5.0,,"Okay, the lines are long and it’s a bit chaotic getting started, but it’s all worth it. The night safari has been so well thought through and it’s a delight to see the array of wild animals on display. The ethos and message is also excellent. The Creatures of the Night show was also good fun."
,,Extraordinary experience,4.0,,"We took the park hopper pass while we went to jurong bird park with the night safari booked for 7.19pm one evening . we did the river safari in the morning and zoo in the after noon and reserved the night safari for next day evening . when we reached there was a big queue to take tram ride . so we picked the map and set out on the walking trail fishing cat and leopard . the lighting is just enough to find your way .you have to see the signboards and proceed . The map cannot be seen in the dimly lit areas .The area has a real rainforest at night atmosphere . after finishing two trails we straightaway went to Creatures of night show at 8.30pm. it lasts about 25 minutes and it features birds,burmese python ,hyena etc .it is a must see show . then we returned to tram starting point and took the same .they give a recorded commentary about various animals we see on the way and it is really an extraordinary experience .The tram ride was about 40 minutes .after dinner at the food court we saw there was no queue to take tram ride . so we went again for the tram ride .Came back at 11.20pm. When we came out to take taxi could not find one . Saw a city bus coming to the park area . we fortunately found one private mini bus. Paid sgd20 to reach little india along with others who took the mini bus with us . Cant really say if after 11.30pm you wil find a taxi at night safari to take you back to downtown."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"This is an experience you should not miss. After a long day at the zoo and the very long queue, it was a relief to sit in the tram and observe the animals at night.
It was quite dark, so we couldn't take pictures, although the enclosures had dim lighting and we could observe the animals up close."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Loved, loved, loved this whole experience! Definitely advise taking a tour (tour east) as this allowed us to skip the lines!"
,,Disappointing Zoo,2.0,,"We’ve heard soo much about this zoo so our expectations were high. Well I can tell you it was very low. I wouldn’t recommend doing the night safari with the tram ride, boring as watching cement dry. By the time we got through the tram ride it was too late to walk through."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"My wife and I went on the night safari, 7pm session on a Thursday night. The night safari was amazing to do by on foot."
,,Such a great experience!,5.0,,"I have never done anything like this before. Many zoos have nocturnal exhibits but you are never really able to see the animals very well interacting in their natural habitat. At the night safari, located right next to the Singapore zoo and the river safari, you are able to take a guided train ride through the park to see most of the animal exhibits and learn about all of their history and relevance to Singapore.

After the the train ride, guests are able to head out into the park on multiple different foot paths where you can get closer and see many different species of animals that you are not able to see from the train! This allows you to get up close, take pictures, and watch these beautiful animals for as long as you want. This was my favorite part as you could get closer and actually observe the animals!

Also included in the visit is a show of course! Visitors sit in an outdoor stadium where a couple of handlers bring out multiple different nocturnal animals such as owls, raccoons, hyenas, and all sorts of other fun animals! This was a great show and overall the night safari was money very well spent!!"
,,Was not able to View the Creatures of the Night Show Properly (Restricted View),3.0,,"Being a resident, I have been to Night Safari multiple times and have generally been satisfied. This time however, for the Creatures of the Night show, the queue was crazy, and we were among the last to be admitted, so we had to content ourselves with the restricted view, which meant that we could not see anything center stage. The tram ride was decent as usual, so I rate my recent visit as average."
,,Not as good as before,2.0,,"My recent visit to the Night Safari was disappointing. I booked the tickets online and was given the choice of 3 different admission times - 7:30, 8:30, or 9:30. I selected the 8:30pm slot. I got into a very long queue at around 8pm, and had to wait for almost an hour before getting onto the tram. I felt like I was waiting for a ride in Disneyland. In the past, there was a tour guide on the tram that gave live commentary on the animals. Now there is only a recording. Also previously, the tram made at least one stop midway through and people had the option to get off and walk around. Now the tram just makes one big round to get back to the park entrance. It seems like the park is trying to get as many visitors in as possible and not care much about their experience."
,,Must visit for families,5.0,,"Night safari is skipped by lot of tourists because everyone is exhausted after river safari and Singapore zoo but night safari is a must see. Watching animals at night active, roaring, howling is a different experience. Luckily was able to hear white lions roar during night safari and was awed by the experience."
,,So dark,2.0,,"Not so many thing to see better go on day time. Only can do on night , take zip car than look around. Waste money"
,,"Save your Money, Save your Time",1.0,,"To be honest I rarely give bad reviews however this time I just cannot do any better.
I have experienced a real night safari in Sth Africa so I have a bit of experience there. We booked from our hotel and were picked up and returned there so that was fine and that's the best part, Once we arrived our guide escorted us into the park and looked at the lines for the train and decided to take us on the loop walk till the lines diminished we guessed now we were supposed to be viewing night animals ok so off we go at a rate of knots as if she is in a sprint race, she stops at a display tells the group what it is then moves on without us having much time to one view or take some pictures!
Next we are on the train with just the driver and a pre-recorded monologue well this becomes just as interesting why you ask?
He pulls up to a display and only he and the first carriage can really see the animals so question 1:doe's he move forward for others to see or 2:speed off to the next display?
Answer is 2 yes we at the tail end get no chance for viewing or photo op !
This went on the whole time and to be honest the rhino where laying down very strange and the 5 elephants we saw were huddled in a spot as if scared and the poor bull elephant was in a separate pen, ok ok so some of you will say well these are live animals and you cannot predict what you will see yes true however most of us did not get to see much and what we did see was somewhat not real after viewing these animals in the real wild. Zoos do a great job in conservation and protection but this review was about this particular attraction and it was not worth the time or much less the money.
They need to train the driver to allow all passengers to view the displays by moving forward to allow them that option."
,,Cool Night Out with Kids,5.0,,"It was a memorable night out for our family of six. To avoid the crowd and to have a more relaxing time, visiting after 8.15pm was good. Generally, we got to see more of the animals from the tram ride than from the trails. The trails were exciting and educational for our children, who never walked in natural reserves in the dark. I recommend going for the trails right at the start when the children are still energetic, and for the tram rides much later when the crowded has thinned, by about 9.30pm. The dance shows at 7pm and 8pm at the Safari entrance are not to be missed."
,,Always unique experience,5.0,,I visited with family 3 times in the last 7 years. Every time it touched my soul. When it is drizzling during the safari the feeling is indescribable. One has to experience it to understand.
,,A must visit,4.0,,"It was a unique experience seeing the animals at night. You might feel the tram ride boring at one point but the actual thrill gets after you get down the tram and start walking through the wallaby trail. The whole place was dark, chill and calm. You get to see the animals so close in the dark and sense a little fear with the sounds that they make"
,,Not many wild animals,2.0,,"During the whole journey for tram ride, what I can summarise for the animal species that were most seen: Pigs, Deer, wild dog, . Other animals are pretty normal which can be found in zoo. Elephants (just about 5 of them), one tiger, one male lion, about 5 hyenas, some wolves, flamingo, 2 giraffe, 1 malayan tapir.... that's it..... and they even stopped by to introduce the tourist a really really small human made water falls which is just about double the height of human. For the price that is paying for seeing these animals, really not worth it. as I would expecting more."
,,Nice experience,3.0,,It was a nice experience but not much animals to see as the sky was too dark.It’s better to walk than sit inside the tram.
,,Going batty on a dark walkabout,4.0,,"I visited with my 13year old daughter on the recommendation of a Singaporean colleague, who said it was better than the zoo. I haven't been to Singapore's zoo, so can't compare, but the Night Safari was pretty good. From other reviews, we may have been lucky, as we went midweek at a quiet time and saw almost all the animals. Our visit was in two parts. The first was a 45 minute tram ride, for which we had to queue for about 20 minutes. This is pretty much completely in the dark, but dim lighting is present in the enclosures. The range of animals is impressive: the tram ride includes sightings of Asian elephants, tiger, lions, hyenas, hippos, rhinos, various species of deer and varieties of pigs. The ride is accompanied by an American voiceover commentary which is informative but characterless and a bit too self-promotional of all the ""great"" conservation work Night Safari does. while this is no doubt true the way it comes across is more Hello! magazine than Blue Planet. It would also be good if the tram stopped for a couple of minutes in complete darkness and silence to enhance the sense of the tropical night. The second part was a lengthy self-guided walk on carefully constructed trails, which was often exciting, and gave a chance to revisit some of the animals seen from the tram plus a lot of others, such as otters, badgers, enormous fruit bats, wallabies, (including a joey in its pouch), various smaller cats and more deer. It feels quite intimate as the animals are quite close, which adds to the whole effect. A few points. First, it is definitely best to go as late as possible, as the animals are probably more active then and the place is quieter. Second, take plenty of patience and bug spray. Don't bother with a camera! This is one place where memories need to be in the mind! Patience is needed as the animals need to be looked for in some of the enclosures. The light is very dim and many creatures are camouflaged, so allow time for eyes to get used to the light levels and look hard. The further away we went from the entrance area the better the experience. Next, the food, drink and souvenir outlets are very expensive, so be warned. The whole entrance area is devoted to a food court and shops with very loud music permanently coming through the speakers. I recommend booking tickets in advance using the Wildlife Reserve Singapore website and taking the order number to the desk on arrival, where the ticket will be printed for you. The website also offers the option of a multi-park ticket. Finally, just to note we arrived at about 8.30 and left at about 11.30 by taxi. It wasn't a problem getting a cab. It was more difficult explaining to the driver where we needed to go! Overall this was a very good experience, but I can see that it is also possible to have a negative experience if the place is very busy."
,,Too much hyped....,3.0,,"I found night safari is too much hyped. I did not find anything special in it. You sit in a open tram and go inside the zoo at night time for about 40 minutes ride. Nothing special in that. Its too much crowded.
For coming back to hotel we boarded bus at around 11pm from just outside the Night Safari to reach one of the metro station. Once you are at a metro station, you may reach anywhere in Singapore. The last bus is at around 12:05am. I will put video of Singapore zoo along with my review and with other information ""how to get there"", ""which ticket to buy"" and ""how to get back late night easily"" on my YouTube channel 'Explore with DD'. Please visit my channel and subscribe it to get the latest video updates.
Thank you and hope to seeing you on my channel."
,,Good exp,4.0,,Good location. Views are limited but my kids loved it. A bit too crowded for our liking. Finding taxi was a bit difficult late at night. Overall good experience.
,,Nor over impressed,3.0,,Was on an organised tour so was given priority on the tram. Unfortunately the animal where not very active and a little hard to see. The show was impossible to get into because of the crowds. And the fire show was average
,,"Too crowded, not worth the time",2.0,,"Fire show was good, and we enjoyed the tram ride. Otherwise it was just lots of people pushing their way through the entrance and to watch the Creatures of the Night show. The show was rather disappointing. Didnt see many animals on the walking trail, most animals were hiding I guess and it was hard to look beyond the darkness of the cages.
There are timings to the tickets (7.15, 8.15, 9.15) and it's best to buy the tickets from the official website rather than through travel agents as the later can't guarantee your preferred time slots."
,,Worth every penny,5.0,,"We did the Night Safari after the zoo and River Safari. Kids were tired after walking for an entire day so we focused on the Amphitheater presentation and tram ride.

The Amphitheater presentation was really good. The presenter was very animated and has a great sense of humor.

The night safari tram ride was one of a kind of experience. Although I did worried about some animals jumping on the tram during the ride but it was absolutely safe. All of our body parts are still intact and all three kids are still with me at the end of the ride (although the 7 yr old almost dozed off with the cool night breeze during the ride).

The only incident that truly irked me during this visit was the group of Indian tourist who cut in line while everyone was queueing for their turn. The situation was so chaotic and there’s NO staffs around to help monitor the situation and control the crowd. It was unfair for the rest of us who follow rules and regulation while there are a group of adults unclipping the barriers and cut in front of others with young children and senior citizens. They even have the nerve to ask us let their friends move up the line because I’ve decided not to let them cut in front of my children. One of the Indian man even touched my 10 year old son’s face with both his hands and kept looking and smiling at him. I was shocked, what’s happening in this safe country??? I truly hope the Night Safari management would look into this and take action to control the situation in the future."
,,Overrated,2.0,,The waiting time was long though I’ve already booked a timing. There wasn’t much animals to see because most were similar gazelles. It wasn’t also very clear because of the dark. Honestly disappointed and would have rather gone to the river safari during the day
,,Nice and good safari at night,4.0,,"Enjoyed family time. Tram ride was great and also the live shows. Since it was late, hence could not go by walk. But it will be great if tram stops bit longer time near the lions and tiger cage."
,,Amazing Experience,4.0,,"The concept of a night zoo is very unique from other zoo. It’s an amazing experience to see animals at night. However, the queue at the entrance is too long. The ticket we bought is to entert the zoo at 8:15pm. We waited in the queue at the entrance from 8:15pm to 8:45pm just to enter the zoo. After entering into the zoo, we have to queue again for the tram to tour around the zoo. Also, we wish there are more water dispensers in the zoo."
,,Great opportunity to see some unique animals up close,4.0,,"This is a top attraction, so be prepared for a large crowd. Get to the animals of the night show early as it does fill up and is on a first come first serve basis. Also be prepared for a long line to ride the tram. I suggest doing the walking part of the park first as the tram ride lines get much shorter after 8:40 PM. The fire dance prior to the entrance is tons of fun for the kids."
,,Zooriific Night,4.0,,"It was a purposeful trip. Walking trails, tram ride, animal show. If you are bringing elderly folks and toddlers. You must go in the earlier slots as you may not be able to finish all that I had listed above. We went in at 8.15 pm and there was just enough time for us to do all those. And we caught the last animal show at 10.30 pm, took the last tram that left at 11.15 pm. I’m glad we managed to do all we set out to. Weekends are crowded if you enter at 9.15 pm, I doubt you get to do much."
,,Wonderful night outing experience,5.0,,Animals were able to roam so closely to the tram. Everyone was so excited. First time hearing a lion roar live (guide said was a whisper).
,,OK la,3.0,,OK la. Not that bad anyway. Good with tram service but still moving fast. Good in marketing and easy to go there and many taxis to back home.
,,Furries after dark,4.0,,"Overall, we had a great time. I would definitely recommend allowing 2-3hrs if your coming to visit at night. We only came for our scheduled tram time, but regretted it after since there were shows and trails that we missed out on. It is a bit difficult to see the animals on the tram at night so the trails may have provided a better view."
,,One of the best Safari in the world.,4.0,,"If you wonder what can you do and see during the night time in a zoo/safari?
You will be surprise until you visit this Night Safari, one of the best in the world.
You will have great opportunity to see many different kind of animals who are real active during night time, you can take the free train riding the safari and peaking the animal at the dark side. And every night will have animal performance at the centre stage, so dont miss it..."
,,Animals have no space,1.0,,"I was very upset to come to the night safari, I had heard the Singapore zoo was the best in the world and that they treated the animals very well, during the night safari you go around in the dark on a train and see the animals in their own areas, I am still intrigued how they keep such wild animals in their own areas, I'm sure wild animals would we exploring the smells of other animals if they are Not being kept there somehow, they all looked quite relaxed and mellow which I found strange. The sizes of the areas the animals had compared to what they would have in the wild was disgusting, no they weren't stuck in cages but the areas were still far too small. The elephants we saw were stood doing repetitive motions over and over which represents they are very distressed, as well as the tiger at the very end which was walking up and down the glass enclosure, this is also distressed behaviour! The animals don't seem to have much of a break as trams of tourists are constantly driving past one after another with a telecom talking about the animals, I don't think this is very good for the animals at all and I don't think the park has the best Intrest of the animals as priority, it is just a zoo trying to make money. The animals here don't look happy."
,,Don’t expect to take a lot of pictures... just be there in the experience!,5.0,,"I took the tram tour then hiked the trails, both are quite neat. Tip for the trams... sit near the front! I was in back row and the team would stop to show something but would be moving by the time we saw it... eliminating any chance of a focused low light shot!
Another tip - wear mosquito protection.... it is a rain forest and something keeps the bats fed!
The feeling of walking in the dark and hearing the lion roar is incredible... a few of the animals were hiding from view, but they are not trained to pose, so it’s the luck of the draw!
I enjoyed the entertainment (fire dancers) before the tours started while eating dinner and although my time was for 8:15, I was able to get on at 7:30. Once the rush of people are through, it is opened up to later reservations.
This is not an amazing chance at photos... instead this safari is more about the experience!!!! I added a couple photos to show what I mean... taken with iphone8. The girls beside me with iPhone 6 couldn’t get anything to work.
Oh and do not miss the bat enclosure... it was awesome!
Extra bonus is the amazing friendly and helpful staff ready to help and guide a person as it can be easy to get turned around... at least for me! But I get lost in daylight as well!"
,,More for children!,5.0,,Children will enjoy this ! The ride was fun. Pay attentions to the recorded audio and you will learn a lot.
,,the night safari is a huge plus,4.0,,This is a remarkably well thought out zoo. The night safari is a fabulous addition especially if you take the time to walk it after the tram ride as you will see the animals active as many are nocturnal. There is way too much fast food so ignore those stalls. All the sections of the zoo deserve adequate time so do not try to rush through any of the exhibits.
,,JUST GOOD,3.0,,"It is a nice idea, but in practice is not something excellent. During the night, you couldn't see so good, you couldn't take a photo"
,,GOOD EXPERIENCE,4.0,,"The Night Safari is a good experience, and we were fortunate to see all of the animals out during the tram ride around the park.
Unfortunately, it is very over-crowded and long queues so it makes it a very long night. I think the organisation needs to be improved to control the amount of people entering the park over the duration of the night."
,,'Nought' Safari,2.0,,"As with the other reviews that i write on TripAdvisor, i will add a Caveat that this is review is totally Subjective and based on my experience (and perception).

My review may appear contrary to what people are 'expecting' about Night Safari.

Being an Animal/Nature Lover, the word Safari, for me, is filled with a lot of sight-seeing and excitement and lots of animals in their wild best! The Night Safari at Singapore Zoo did not invoke any of those feelings. It turned out to be a Damp squib.

It was more Drama and less Reality. There is nothing unique that was showcased at this event.

The long Queues to get into the Tram made it worse.

There is nothing worthwhile to remember about this Safari.

Its Just another way for the Zoo to earn a little more money by giving a ""night safari"" tag to an extremely boring Tram ride.

There was a Fire show/stunt at the Entrance of Night Safari, which was good, but it is a totally ""disconnected"" event and i am wondering why it needs to be there at the Night Safari.

And then there was an Animal Show, where a few nocturnal animals were ""displayed"".

This show was high on Drama (and Rhetoric) and low on Animals/birds or their activities. Its a total waste of time. The Presenter of this Show was the only Saving grace and the only thing good to talk about this show. Nothing else is good about this animal show.

I have seen extremely engaging animal shows at other Zoos that almost captivate you and make you look forward for an another show!

I must add here that the experience at the Day Zoo was just the Opposite, it was an extremely awesome experience. I highly recommend you to visit the Zoo during the day instead.

And here is my review about it -
https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r590047506-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

My Verdict : You are perfectly OK to SKIP the Night Safari as you are not going to lose any great stuff/experience."
,,Nice night zoo,3.0,,It is well done but felt rushed. If you have been to the actual Singapore zoo then there is really no need to come here. The enclosures are good but not a huge difference in range of animals. Night show is ok but if sitting further away it is very hard to see.
,,Unique experience of watching animals at night,5.0,,"This is a must visit safari among other available ones. I would recommend you to take park hopper plus pass to visit Singapore Zoo, Jurong bird park, Night safari and river safari. This will minimise the cost and also let's you see all 4 attractions in 7 days. This is quite unique experience as you normally don't get a night safari. This safari is essentially a 40 min tram ride showing all the animals and explaining about them. You will be amazed to see the animals at night and their behavior. You are allowed to take pictures but without flash. I would recommend you to sit back and enjoy the ride instead of taking pictures. Also, there are some walking trails and shows which you definitely don't want to miss."
,,Good experience for the kids,4.0,,Overall very good experience for my kids as compared to the day zoo! The only suggestion we have is to have more shows or a bigger place to cater for more audience.
,,Family Holiday,5.0,,"first of all
if you want to entry the 7.15 show you have to queue from 6 thats the only way you can get front queue

I suggest you to take the tran first
they will take your photos in the tram so make your best pose

heheheheheheh

No flashlight during the tram because the wild animal would be distracted

after the tram, go to amphiteatre for night animal show

thanx God I got the chance to join and chosen to help the ranger bring out the snake which I was very afraid to the snake

it was a lovely experience!!!"
,,Great evening out,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the Creatures of the Night show and also the safari trip afterwards, and loved to have a bit of free time afterwards to roam the rest of the site, great trip, we’ll worth doing!"
,,"Disappointing evening, over priced",3.0,,"Soent two hours in queue for tram ride. Scheduled for 7 15 tour, didnt get on to tram until 915,too many people, too long to wait and then not worth the bother. Waste of time and money"
,,Exciting Evening,4.0,,"We arrived a about 7.40 for the 8pm tickets and it was quite hectic when we first arrived, however they let us about 5/10 min early so we could get straight in the park. I would recommend walking around the trails first and then going back to do the Safari as the queues were huge when we first arrived, having gone around the park though we only had to wait a couple of mins and jumped on the next coach that arrived. We got to see many animals and there seemed to be an orientation to recycling which is always good :)"
,,Loved the night safari,5.0,,"Timings are 7/7:30pm-12pm
It's best to stand around 6:00pm onwards in the line if you want to spend your time there. If you are an animal lover,you will definitely take 4hrs.
You begin with sitting in an open long train/bus and has many 5-6stops.You are not allowed to walk or cross the main lane, you have to walk from inside all small and narrow lanes.You can see many animals from a distance since they are left open in an area. Be careful of flying squirrels, they missed my head twice in a certain area. Had a fun time there, wouldn't mind going there another couple of times.
Adventure experience - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Location - ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Safari maintainence - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
,,"Though a Zoo, can Feel Safari",5.0,,"This is about a 40 min ride on a tram. Though it's a zoo, you can get the real feeling of a safari. Very good descriptions are given as the animals are passed by. If you hope to do more activities at the zoo than just the night safari, go there on Friday, weekend or on a public holiday. Use public transportation to go there as a taxi costs high."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"Tram ride is good. You get to see some animals, as it is night time most of the animals are already slept. We were able to see Hyena and Tiger and some other animals.
The tram has stops but it does not stop at those stops. This is disappointing as you cannot get down at a stop and see the other animals by yourself.
Also, people were not friendly at all, I was with my father, a senior citizen, so we requested if they can stop the tram at least at one designated tram stop but they bluntly refused."
,,Remember to prebook your tickets + some key highlights,5.0,,"The night safari tickets operates differently than the zoo and river safari in that you have to book a time slot for entry. So please take note! Be sure to click around the website so you know what to expect. I recommend starting your visit with the free tram ride. You queue to get on very close to the entrance. It takes you around some parts of the night safari reserve. You’re dropped of near where you started, and from there you can explore the various trails. I highly recommend you venture towards the Leopard Trail and visit the Mangrove Walk where fruit bats roam free and fly around you! Just don’t pet them because they bite.
As one last note, I urge you not to be one of those tourists who ignore the no flash photography warning. Don’t be that kind of person! Please respect the animals!"
,,long queues in june,5.0,,"Went in a june weekend, which was peak as its school hols. Super long queues everywhere! Besides that it was fun experience especially for kids"
,,It had been a great experience.. however we would have liked if the attraction was timed a lil longer..also since we,4.0,,Went for the night schedule it was a lil difficult to see the animals to due to less lighting if that can be fixed it would be 5stars
,,Great night out,5.0,,We visited on the 12th of June .We arrived about half an hour before opening and joined a large queue which was entertained by a fire juggling show which was excellent.The gates opened and the queue moved very quickly and once inside we did the tram ride first .This took us around all the animals the guide giving us lots of interesting facts along the way .The animals were sometimes hard to spot but you would expect this on occasion .After the tram ride we walked all the trails and see far more of the animals which was a great experience.We ate at the food court having a very good indian meal which was very good value for money .Just one thing to mention is this attraction is not the easiest to get too as not right in the centre would recommend getting a taxi which was reasonably priced .To sum up this is a very good night out which we really enjoyed
,,"animals not many, a set back not allow boarding at east gate ag",4.0,,Animal not many A set back not allow boarding at east gate and have to walk back to entrance for traim
,,Must do,5.0,,What an experience seeing wild animals up close. Had such a great time. I would recommend getting in line early as there was heaps of people lying up.
,,poor safari,1.0,,"a van to cross a zoo at night, overcrowded . It is not a safari but a ride in a zoo at night. 30 minutes , for 1,5 hour queuing."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Booked this trip prior to visiting Singapore as it looked stand out and very glad we did
Half hour session in the amphitheatre which was very entertaining but with an important environmental message.
The animals were very well trained
Then onto the main event which was mind blowing and the best part of the holiday
To be up close at night to so many species was incredible and we particularly enjoyed the giraffes, elephants and lions
With the lights out on the tram the animals were floodlit in their little sections and was very effective
There was also the option of a walk after the tram ride
The queues, although long was very efficiently handled by the staff, good food options and the fire eating dancers were brilliant
On leaving there were good options by bus and taxi and in fact the last bus back to the city was about 0015 which left plenty of time to enjoy this amazing experience
Fully recommended"
,,Something different!,5.0,,"Took the 9:15pm slot. Was still busy, but wasn’t too bad. Can have the option of doing tram and the walk. I would advise to do the tram first. I wouldn’t suggest to do the 1015pm for tram, as when we did the walking trail (similar time as the last slot), the animals had gone from sight. i think 8-9pm is their feeding time, so you’ll know they’ll be out and about! Highly recommend to maximise your day out."
,,Animals to see,5.0,,"Only place to see animals in the dark, although I did not see any lions, I am still quite satisfied with their shows they have to offer."
,,Awsome,5.0,,A one of its kind.Not to be missed.You feel as if you are passing through an open forest.You really see all kind of animals and that too so close
,,Nice cooling walk,4.0,,"Nice place. Still well-maintained after my first visit 12 years ago. Hope to have more information on animals most active time so we dont waste time seeing nothing in some areas. Also, tram waiting time seriously need to be improved especially on public holidays."
,,Excellent place for young and old,4.0,,"Amazing forest, full of green and the trees are tall, good crowd system and most important healthy animals."
,,A Fun loving nite ....,5.0,,Fabulous staff who guided us all the way to safari ... it was fun loving xperience.. the tram was moving aptly at every stop so that view of animals was visible ... kids loved it to the zenith.. a bit scary in the parts where there was no lite at all .. but the the aura of jungle was to b felt like this only... overall amazing xperience ... full enjoyment for kids ..miss u singapore
,,Be ready for hour Long queues. Avoid if raining. But amazing otherwise.,5.0,,"We were lucky. The rain stopped just as our ride started. Else, the hour Long wait in the queue would have been such a waste.

Check weather before you go. Avoid if raining. Pay for tram fast lane. The queue is quite bad. You can’t walk around many places. So take the tram.

But once you are in - it’s a good nice tram ride. Nice exhibits. Nice narration in the tram. Very well done. The tram rides felt like 2-3 kms & takes around 20 mins."
,,Inconsistency,3.0,,The malayan tiger was not the same as before I saw. Smaller in size now. Not consistent. The rhino was hiding. Cannot see.
,,Kids loved it,5.0,,"We visited the zoo with our 5 yr old daughter and my 8 yr old niece.. they absolutely loved it. There was a massive line to get into the trams, but it was moving very quicky.."
,,Couple Trip to Night Safari,3.0,,The NS was crowded and been queue 1 hour for the tram. Hopefully variety of animals for viewing could be increase in future.
,,Great,4.0,,Great with or without children. First we did the visit in walking and then we took the mini bus. Everything was great except waiting for mini bus
,,Night viewing,5.0,,Nice experience and close encounter with the animals. It was very crowded and will be more wonderful if there are more tram services.
,,"In my opinion, Night Safari was a great place, where I could meet up-close and personal with this Nocturnal animals",5.0,,Night Safari is a place where i could my show my true instant with this relative creature that has ruled the earth for thousands for years.
,,Night Safari on a Saturday,2.0,,"Queues were way too long. 20-30 minute wait time for tram and creatures show. Waste of already limited time at the zoo, especially with limited quota for different entry times. Parents with young kids like myself suffered. Better to go on a wet, weekday night."
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,Educational! Specially for children who never get to see up close night owls and the like - just having to see the animals in person is more than enough experience
,,Amazing visit,5.0,,"An absolute must, organised really well, did not have to queue, the organised ride around the park was just amazing, so close to all the animals, although the wolves stole the show as we came around the corner they started howling at the moon. Would recommend this to anyone!"
,,Great experience,4.0,,It was a great experience for both kids and adults. However the place was crowded and had to wait more than an hour to get in to a tram. Better to arrive at the place 1hour prior to the start time
,,"Very Good, Shame About The Poor Crowd Control",4.0,,"Booked in for the 20:15 bus, the queue started from 19:30. Some people just do not know how to queue, trying to push themselves through to the front by saying their family is there. Staff were not bothered about this. Once you are seated on the tram, you are taken at a slow speed through the park, you get to see the animals in the night which was very cool. Its a shame that it is quite quick, a stop of a minute or so would be nice so you could look for the animal.
There is also a walking option should you want to do this too, but we decided not to."
,,Whole family will enjoy,5.0,,Fantastic night out. Was raining when we attended but didn’t detract from the experience. Must do when in Singapore
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was my second time at the night safari and have to say that I have enjoyed it more this time round as most or the animal were very active during our visit. Would definitely recommend.
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Not as good as the Singapore zoo , gives a thrilling experience nevertheless. Do not couple it with Singapore zoo , as it can make you extremely tired. First , you are take the tram ride. The queues are insanely long, so make it a point to arrive atleast 30-45 mins before your slot time. There is nothing much to worry .There are many trams, thereby the queue moves quickly.
After the tram ride , you can choose to take the walking trails and walk the zoo. Doing this will enable you to see many Animas that you missed during your tram ride. The walking can take about 2 hours to complete depending on which trails you wish to take.
Remember to watch the Creatures of the night show . Take note of the show timings and reach the theatre well in advance , as it could become housefull. The show is not as good as the Singapore zoo shows , but you can watch it nonetheless for a good pastime."
,,GREAT ATTRACTION,4.0,,"We went here a few years ago for the evening tour. It was great, although the included meal was a bit substandard. A buffet with stodgy food. Apart from the meal, the rest of the event was fantastic."
,,Dont waste your time and money,1.0,,"Totally CRAP!!!!. The walk was a total waste of time as you cannot see bloody anything..apart from cursing all the way. The show was crap. Only tram ride was good..Better spend your money shopping than paying for such exorbitant ticket fee to this night safari. Trust me, do not waste your money here!!!"
,,Good night out,4.0,,"Good way to spend a night out. Something different instead of the same old drinking and eating. Most of the animals were active, even got to see and hear 2 Lions have a roar off which is so much better then seeing it on tv"
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,It's fabulous to be on a night safari at the Singapore Zoo. Feels like you are in the jungle amidst the wild. Well arranged for an awesome experience
,,Underwhelming,1.0,,"I’ve come away feeling rather underwhelmed at my experience at the night safari.
Understandably. when going to these types of attractions you will experience crowds. But this was like nothing I’d ever seen!
Team this with pushy patrons, hot weather and ridiculous queues, it soon became my worst nightmare.
And to rub salt into the wound, as we were leaving to get a taxi we were approached by an independent car hire company who tried to fleece us 50 dollars for a trip that ended up costing only 13 dollars via a local taxi ride."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"The queues are very long so do arrive in advance. Line up for shows around 30 mins before they start. The Creatures of the Night show is very popular and well worth the wait.

Buying tickets online will save you a lot of time and money. Asides from the official website, try tour agencies such as Klook which offer discounts.

It is very dark, and flash photography isn't allowed. You won't be able to get great photos, and it will be hard to see some animals, but still it is a worthwhile experience.

Plenty of food and drinks, restaurants etc available if needed. There is no MRT station near the night safari, but there are many buses that will take you to one. The staff are helpful and can advise you on how to return to your hotel via public transport, as taxis/Grab get very expensive at night.

The tram is not worth it as you won't be able to see the animals clearly from the tram. There is also a very long queue for the tram. Simply take the trails. There are many trails, so do take a look at the map and plan beforehand."
,,Save your valuable Singaporean dollars,1.0,,"We thought this was rated as the number 1 attraction in Singapore. Well what a dismally disappointing visit we had. People everywhere, chaotic, little direction, ropes and people going in all directions. The place is set up to strip every cent out of you where you have to manipulate food stalls, gift shops, bars, masses of people, untrained staff who give varying and conflicting direction just to get in. As we found the tickets we purchased we then had to pay more to get on a tour as otherwise needed to wait until 9.15pm when we got there at 6.45pm, yep that is why all the stops to get your dollar. The Safari itself in an oversized golf cart which rushed passed every animal display where the commentary was telling you about the animals you had already passed... This tour was crap, worst we have done. It was hot, dirty, commentary was broken, guides had no idea, people going everywhere and can only be described as chaotic and overpriced. Look else where to spend your money in this expensive place. If I could give a no dot rating I would."
,,Too dark. Interesting but cannot see too much,2.0,,Too dark. Nice idea but too dark. Long tram queue. Didnt mind it moved fast. But so dark couldnt really see much
,,Probably good if it wasn’t overcrowded,1.0,,I guess we would have enjoyed our visit if it weren’t for the huge crowd and extensive waiting line. A nightmare with 2 kids
,,Overall good experience,5.0,,"Night safari, exhausting but worth the visit. Took the first slot 7.15pm went there and the queue was crazy for the tram ride. We were advised to go for the trail walk first. The trail was exhausting as there were a lot to see but don't put too much expectations as some of the night creatures were hiding (not able to see). You can also catch the lion and tiger feeding time but to me, it is not that fascinating. You can skip that alternatively. A must watch is the"
,,Zoo night visit,4.0,,The night safari was great you need to book in advance as it can get very busy over weekends with thousands of people going to the zoo. What great experience to see animals at night that you may not be able to see during the day.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,After spending the day at Singapore zoo we had high expectations for the night safari. Booked the 715pm show...even turning up early we were standing in queues for well over an hour in 30° plus. Tram ride less than impressive with half the animals unable to be viewed..'sleeping'. Save your money and enjoy the zoo during the day instead.
,,Over rated,1.0,,Wouldn’t recommend it. Hours and hours of lining up for a 30 minute trip around an average Zoo then another hour waiting for a taxi

,,Very nice visit but long queue !,3.0,,"Very nice visit but long queue to get on a train. Impossible to access the shows. We should have taken a walk through the zoo first, and come back to the trains later when the queue was much shorter."
,,Visit to Night Safari,2.0,,"It was hard to see the animals and many of them will either not visible or not present. We understand that the animals are norturnal, however when you are trying to spot animals at every exhibit, it becomes quite dreary, especially with kids."
,,One of the most memorable night in night safari,5.0,,"We were there by 6:45 PM and were in que for trams. After completion of 45 Min tram ride, we enjoyed the creature of Night show and subsequently we enjoyed thumbakaar performance.
It is to be noted that Thumbakaar Performance occurs outside safari gate therefore please get your hand stamped while exiting safari if you are willing to go in again later.
Then we enjoyed beautiful trails (most memorable) in Night and it will feel like one is walking in open jungle in night......you will see lion, hyenna, beer etc. from very near spots and these animals were roaming freely as in their natural habitat(no cages off course).
We passed through chambers of flying fox also, could see sugar glider, slow loris,binturong, lemur,fishing cat and many more animals in Night Safari. Surely one of a different kind of experience."
,,Nice setting but crazy queues,3.0,,Nice setting and layout. But had trouble with online ticketing and had to run all the way to zoo entrance (which is quite far from the safari) to get tickets. Crazy tram queues...ended up with the bulk of time in tram queue.
,,Enjoyable trip in the Night safari,4.0,,Overall good experience & the waiting time for tram was too long. Young childrens are discomfort in the long waiting que.
,,Not worth it.,2.0,,The wait was longer than the safari. Didn’t get on the tram until almost an hour after arriving slightly earlier than the reservation time. Difficult to see the animals in the dark and some didn’t come out of their hiding places. Would recommend passing and just visiting during the day.
,,Don't rush this experience,5.0,,"I wish I had more time to explore this entire region. I wish I had gotten there earlier so I could take advantage of the many walks, shows & area attractions."
,,unexpected delight,5.0,,"We really loved the safari and show, much better than expected. Very atmospheric. We were looked after well, and given appropriate advice as we found it a bit difficult to negotiate on our own."
,,The best evening program for families,5.0,,"We have enjoyed visiting the night safari, you can take a ride and also have long walks amongst animals in a very safe way. The animals are pretty active in the evening, you can really see them how they live."
,,Night Zoo Tour rather than Safari,3.0,,"I was somewhat underwhelmed. Whilst the tour was clearly well organised and very popular, I was expecting it to take in some of the extensive grounds, but no it was a tour around some relatively average sized enclosures.

Both the male elephants were rocking back and forth, and appeared to be chained up to ensure they could be seen.

Had I known this before going, I would not have gone. I just hope that as part of the extensive work that is underway that they allow some of the animals the freedom to roam rather than having them chained up like circus acts."
,,Night Safari visit,5.0,,Really enjoyed seeing the different animals at night time - we were lucky enough to see almost all the animals and thought it was well set out and commentary was very interesting.
,,Fantastic Singapore Experience,5.0,,"Absolutely loved Night Safari! Well organised and engaging evening activity, friendly for all ages and educational as well as entertaining. Loved the guided tour as well as the opportunity to walk around and explore. Would absolutely recommend and would visit again! Look forward to seeing Night Safari evolve!"
,,A must see,5.0,,We’ve done this twice and enjoyed it both times. Great animal show and tram ride is about an hour. I would suggest getting there earlier to do some of the walking paths. The fire show is also cool.
,,A great experience,4.0,,"While it is a bit of a hike to get to the night zoo, there are plenty of tours available to beat the travel worries. The tram ride is a must do, and if your budget allows, a priority pass on the tram will save a lot of waiting time. The tram will take you past most of the animal enclosures and generally, you will see all of the wildlife on offer. Afterwards, you can walk the various trails to take another look up close and at your leisure. There are also a few shows to see."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"The night Safari is very nice. There are various animals. You can walk around and see them by yourself. We booked a tour which is really great. I recommend it because there is a guide who explains everything to you. Also with the tour, we can feed elephants."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"I have been to the night safari twice and had an awesome time both times I visited. I have been to zoos all over the world and Singapore Zoo (night safari, specifically) is one of the best."
,,Holiday,5.0,,"Go for the creature of the night show.... awesome! Most of the animal are night active. It’s the only zoo that we know, offering and catering to the habits of wild livi*ng and night active animals."
,,Night time with wild animals!!,4.0,,"We visited Night Safari in May 2018.

We took a guided tram ride, with live commentary, as it was more convenient for us, after the just concluded rains.
Huge rush, long queues for tram ride. It nearly took us 2 hours in the queue to finally get a seat in the tram.

Once inside the tram, it was a wonderful experience, watching the animals in their natural habitat at night.

The shows - Creatures of the Night show and Fire show were cancelled due to rain."
,,Tours,5.0,,"Great night experience seeing the amazing super trees in the gardens that light up, also you get a very good cruise and the sky deck."
,,Walking trails !,4.0,,The night safari has a show and a tram ride which are popular.The show was good.The tram ride had long queues with long wait times.We decided to do the trail instead of waiting for the tram.There are 4 trails -we did 3.It was a good decision because it got us a few inches away from the leopard in his glass enclosure.It may be the closest we ever get to one!There were not many people on the trail and it was a good experience.Throughout the various walking trails you have many opportunities to see the animals up close and personal.Flashlight and flash photography not alllowed.You can walk at any pace you desire and linger around for as much time.There are restrooms spaced out quite well.We finally took the tram after we were done with the walking trails.Felt the tram ride to be much ado about not much!Been there and done that!
,,All in one,5.0,,Great place to visit and to spend your time with partner. The best night zoo we visited in the world
,,Fabulous Place to visit,5.0,,"We had a wonderful time at the night safari. The show was really excellent and the woman compere (sorry I forgot her name) was brilliant. I thought that the handlers were all very respectful of the animals. The tram ride was simply amazing. To be so close to the animals without cages or bars was incredible and they seemed to take little notice of us. We saw the white lion and his mate, elephants, the tiger, giraffe, tapir, rhinos, and so many others. I would highly recommend a visit and wish we had had enough time to go in the day also."
,,The comfortable zoo,5.0,,"While the walking trails will bring you to more up close exhibits, the Night Safari tram was sufficiently satisfying for my trip there. We encountered countless animals on the tour and didn't even break a sweat in the coolness of the night. The Creatures of the Night show was also pleasant as the host was humourous. Well worth the time and money. An attraction I would go again and again."
,,Zoo Visit at night,3.0,,Now a days it has become comfortable. One can travel in a tram inside the zoo. You have an option of going on foot also. The tram takes you around and there is running commentary also telling about all the animals inhabited there. It’s a 40 minutes ride. While waiting in the queue before the ride you are photographed and the photos can be purchased at the end of the journey. There are restaurants also where one can have food. Some souvenir shops are also there. Overall a nice outing for all ages
,,Rude crowds ruin the evening,3.0,,"I found the evening to be a little disorganised. Rude crowds of people pushing their way to get on safaris, no respect for queues or ticket times. The paths in the park were poorly lit and a bit confusing and disorientating . Had trouble getting from walking paths back to the show in time. We were on 8:15 safari and had to RUSH to the 9:30 last show. I would recommend booking the 7:15 safari and arriving early. We were on 8:15 tour and had people constantly pushing past us in the queue cause they were late for their 7:15 tour. Very poor organisation."
,,It's Amazing Concept,3.0,,"It feels great to see all animals while you travel in open vehicle during night time. But, for people who have seen really safari in Forest will miss that thrill and excitement which we see inside Forest. For experiencing that one must visit the Forest in India, Kenya etc. The concept is beautifully designed but artificial will remain artificial if you have already seen the real."
,,Not worth it,1.0,,"Good for children , only one time experience .
The wait can be too long , I will Aires for around 50 minutes before boarding for a 40 minute ride , only few exotic animal. To my surprise it included even Indian buffalo , they should include few more exotic animals and manage it a bit.

The ambience was very good though ."
,,Fantabulous night safari,5.0,,"Went to night safari and had great time with family. There was an anchor who welcomed everyone in audience in various languages, specially she conversed very well in hindi. It was followed by acts by various animals. They even brought a very long python and allowed some people to touch it. At last there was photo session with owl and others. It was followed by a ride in mini train to the jungle safari where one can see the animals without any fencing and some seems to be at an arm distance. Very nice adventure"
,,Night safari,4.0,,A very nice place to tour around at night. Got the family tickets so the tram is free! I love the animal show. Always looking forward to go again.
,,A good night out and lots to see,4.0,,"If you like animals you will love the night safari. We took the 7:15 session and it was a full stadium for a Saturday night . When we finished the show the queue for the bus ride was long so we walked around the enclosures and saw most of the animals, make sure you grab a map as this will help you target what you want to see. Our kids are 9 and 11 and we finished about 10:15pm...they both fell asleep in the taxi back to the hotel."
,,Rain!,4.0,,"I would have given the Night Safari with buffet five stars, but our experience was marred by the weather. We booked a tour that included hotel pick up. We were taken to Chinatown and had to wait around a little while for other participants to arrive, which we weren't expecting, but it was clearly the meeting point for many of Singapore's tours. Our tour guide, Robin, was informative and helpful and obviously loved the environment and animals. The buffet dinner was OK, but we only had about 45 minutes to eat, so it was a little rushed.

Our tour included 'skip the line' tickets for the tram, which was a good thing as the queues were extremely long. Unfortunately for us it started to pour with rain when we got on the tram. The tram guide advised anyone who had a problem with the rain to pull down the plastic side shades, which were opaque, so when the woman in front of us pulled down the shade our view was ruined. The tram has a covered roof, so there is no need really to pull down the side shades. The whole point is to see the animals and even though the rain meant viewing was less than it should be, the shades made it impossible. My advice is stop telling patrons to pull down the shades, it's not necessary.

Luckily the rain eased after the tram ride and we were able to enjoy the walking trails with our guide, Robin, who imparted interesting information along the way.

Parts of the zoo are commercialised, but it's good the main focus is on the animals roaming free in a natural habitat. I look forward to returning on a rain free night next time I'm in Singapore."
,,"Relaxed environment, great experience",5.0,,Great experience. The visit was pleasant. Walking through the habitats in the evening was very relaxed and different from any other zoos.
,,Night safari adventure,3.0,,Prepare yourself for a long line because there is a bit of a wait. Worth watching with kids and teens.
,,"An Attraction, like Disney",3.0,,"The idea behind the park is great, but it's a victim of its popularity. There was a fire act going on in the restaurant near the entrance, which was accompanied by loud music audible for some distance through the park. I was told that I HAD to take the tram, which was a zoo of humanity and none of whom knew how to disable the flash on their phones (no flash photography allowed). At one point the driver got out and walked the length of the train to tell people no photography. I learned AFTER the tram that there were many quiet a delightful trails, which I highly recommend. It was a hard place to find a corner to enjoy the animals in a quiet dark place. The exhibits and enclosures seemed pretty good in terms of naturalistic settings and decent to the creatures themselves. Don't expect anything other than a night zoo experience."
,,Love em animals,5.0,,"Kudos to the Singapore government and zoo officials who have done a wonderful job on this, this is a must do when in singapore. You wont regret it. The Show on nocturnal animals was excellent a good learning for kids and adults"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"The Night Safari is one of Singapore's top attractions. Located near the Singapore Zoo Resort area you can combine a ticket here with one or more attractions (Singapore Zoo and River Safari) to get a discount. Tickets for the Night Safari are entry timed. So you pick the time you want to enter the park but once you're in, you can stay for as long as you like. We chose the first entry time slot (7.15) and even though it was a weekday, there were already hundreds of people waiting to enter the park from about 6.45. If you want to be the first in, then consider getting your tickets early and queuing up from about 6.15! The majority of the crowds were heading straight towards the tram tour which takes you on a 25 minute silent tram ride (with english speaking voice over) around the park enclosures. The wait time to get on the tram was quite long, we waited almost 40 minutes through a cattle grid queue system before we boarded. It's the main attraction so dont miss out on this. But if you want to avoid the waiting in line, then either consider visiting the park later (its open until 12am) or entering the park and doing the walking tours first (which I'll describe later on). The tram tour takes you around different ""open"" enclosures where animals are free to roam and can sometimes be right on the roadside. It was great to see most of the animal in open enclosures and not behind metal bars or perspex, some of the bigger or more dangerous animals (like the hyenas) were cleverly held back by natural landscaping rather than being caged. After the tram tour, you can disembark and do one or all of 4 walking trails which take you further in for a more up close and intimate encounter with the animals. You see much more on the walking trails so definitely consider doing at least a couple of them. Despite the crowds for the tram tour, the walking trails were surprisingly quiet (it seems most people are content with just the tram tour) so you can enjoy listening to the sounds of the jungle and hearing the lions calling unnervingly close by. The paths are dimly lit to preserve the experience (so be careful with young children) but we loved how the dimly lit paths made it really feel like we were in a jungle with unknown wildlife just around the corner. There's also a Creatures of the Night show we shows a couple of times throughout the night, consider this if you have small children as they will love it - but it can be missed if you've seen similar shows (owls, otters, pythons) before. The Night Safari is definitely worth a visit especially if you like animals, it was one of our favourite attractions on our trip to Singapore. You'll need about an hour if you just want to do the tram tour, and about 2-3 hours if you want to do the tram tour and all 4 walking trails. Final point, as its the jungle, we recommend bringing insect repellent, you will get bitten otherwise."
,,Very good experience,5.0,,It was and awesome experience for my kids as well as for me first in it's king a zoo to visit in night you get all kinds of animal to see in night just have to wait for tramp train for bit long in pic season that's all rest is al good
,,It was alright,3.0,,"If you have nothing else to do, it is worth checking out. I just felt it was WAY over priced, and if it weren't for the fact that we already drove all the way out to the park, we would have left and chosen something else to do. We went right at 7:30, and you do get to see a lot of the animals, but usually for only a few seconds. Don't even think about getting any pictures either. The animals are nocturnal, so they don't allow flash photography. The creatures of the night show was nice, but it was definitely catered towards children. You have the option of walking the trials and seeing the animals at your own pace, but it is a little creepy walking on your own in the dark. We tried to follow one, until my brother and I were scaled and bit by a bunch of ants! We were tired and itchy and decided to go home."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,Very unique experience and worth using your eyes in stead of looking through camera. Only sad part was creatures of the night was jampacked and some animals were not to be seen to the people in one side.
,,Amazing Night,4.0,,"I was a part of a small tour group, had the tram to ourselves and off we set out for our guided ride through the open park.
What an awesome idea to have this concept.
After the tram ride, we were able to go off and do our own activities. There were paths to be taken for another look at the creatures of the night, shows to be watched, or just have a bite to eat or drink.
Would recommend to go, but be aware, they may be shy, it’s the luck of the draw....."
,,Such a joy,5.0,,"Our Singaporean friend recommended and took us to this park.
There’s a fire dance just before to gain entry to park. Started with a nice pint of Tiger beer - recommended .
Then most tourists jump to the tram but i advise taling the walking tour first. Shy creatures do come out when fewer people around. When the tram queue peters out, then tram is recommended. It’s a must-do though.
‘Creatures of the night’ is fun. Gets filled up quickly but you will definitely get a place. Recommended seat in the ampitheatre would be left side down( whilst facing the stage), about 3 rows behind the stage.
Nice eateries as soon as you exit. Not very expensive.

,,Watch for those bright eyes gleaming back at you...,4.0,,"The world’s first night zoo is located in a somewhat remote rainforest, 10 km from the nearest subway, Khatib. To get here, take a taxi or the Mandai Express from Khatib ($1- only with your EZ-link card). Close to the Zoo and the River Safari. Packages available. 3 entry times, 1 hr apart from 7:15. Very busy and a fair bit of walking on the 4 trails. The tram is a good bet but it is crowded and full of excited children. Must dos are “Creatures of the Night Show” (Amphitheatre), Fire Show and Fishing Cat Trail. Highlight for me was seeing a Civet, Serval, Hyena, Flying Foxes and some unusual animals that I didn’t recognize. A little dark in places, but watch out for those bright eyes gleaming back at you. Food available at Mama Panda Kitchen and the Ulu Ulu Safari spot."
,,Great time but book tickets before you go,5.0,,"Book your tickets online or with the hotel concierge so you don't need to queue when you get there. Go on the optional walking tracks first and see the show, Creatures of the night, then do the guided tour on the vehicles, that way you don't need to queue for as long and you get to see more. There are lots of food options available and public transport (train and bus) to and from is very efficient.
This a great experience, well done."
,,Good experience but very crowded,3.0,,Spent most of the evening queuing up for the trolley that takes you around the zoo. I'm glad that I went but I wouldn't go see it again.
,,Good experience but highly overrated and priced,3.0,,The night safari is a good experience but is not one of the must have experience if you’re on a shoe string budget. The price tag of 47 SGD per person seemed to high after completing the tour. It takes you for a ride in the jungle on a tram where you get to see various animals at different places. The animals seemed oblivious of their surroundings and paid no heed to the approaching tram. The tram passed really close to some of them. The only attraction was the 30 min show “Creatures of the Night” which is held every hour. The compère was fantastic and kept everyone on their edge of their seat
,,ONE OF THE BEST NIGHT SAFARI,5.0,,"It started at 7.30pm with an hour time interval between entrees. Kick start your night with the fire show at the entrance. Stunning skill and very entertaining. Then ride the electric tram complete with audio commentary taking you around the safari where you can see many creatures along the way. Then you can choose to walk in the trails provided to better observe the creatures in the dark. Its an exciting experience. Last, before you leave make sure you attend the night safari night animal show. Its super fun. Not much photo to show sorry coz they aint got so many lights in there. Your eyes can catch the animal just fine but not necessarily your camera. Adoyos..."
,,Do it!,5.0,,"If you don't have time to do anything else, do the Night Safari. It gets really crowded so buy your tickets online, then at the counter they have an option where you can pay $10 per persons and you don't have to wait in line with everyone else. Worth it!

You can walk the park or ride a tram that takes you around. They give you headphones and you can plug it in to the tram, it provides an audio guided tour in like 8 to 10 different languages. It takes around 45 mins to finish the park via the tram. You get so close to the animal it's awesome!"
,,"So, so worth it, even with 2 tired little ones",5.0,,"We loved the night safari, we did the tram ride with our 5&3 yr old. We took the SMRT to Ang Mo Kio followed by bus 138 (20-25 min) and had dinner at the rotisserie in front of the Night Safari queue lines. We started queueing at 18.40 and quickly moved forward and saw the fire show before we got in at a little past 19.00. A few trains waiting we got on at about 19.20 and it was an amazing ride. ‘Moonlight’ lit grounds with deer, elephants, flamingos, tapirs and a tiger. We skipped the show as the kids were tired and took a taxi back to the city, kids fast asleep"
,,An unorthodox idea,4.0,,"Come and watch animals by night. A nice concept and idea as some animals are primary nocturnal. The bad thing is that the view is unclear as we human are diurnal animals (although this is being challanged too). Most of the safari is only viewed and accessed through tram train and no walking allowed. And the waiting line in the entrance is killing. Otherwise, the show are amazing, especially the fire play, and the nocturnal walk through the woods is really heart throbbing."
,,Mesmerizing elephant - eerily beautiful,5.0,,"Such a great park - so many animals come out late at night; it’s great to see them in this different type of environment. One amazing moment was this elephant highlighted by the moon (more probably a spotlight!!) in a stance raising his trunk and tusk to the sky!
Eerily beautiful - it feels such a unique experience and I thoroughly recommend"
,,Not to be missed..,4.0,,It would be better if the tram stops at every point for few minutes. Trail is better than tram experience.
,,Informative and interesting,4.0,,The go on safari one needs to have patience. During holidays and weekend the place is flooded with tourists. It’s worth waiting ... very neatly maintained and the audio information helps us to spot animals and know about them.
,,Express Tram,4.0,,"Running short on time during our recent stay in Singapore (last week) we decided on the Night Safari. Unless you are really good with public transport in Singapore taxi was to way to go - from inner Singapore to Zoo SGD 20. Getting back to Singapore - plenty of taxis available. We didn't have to wait and we left there at 11.15 pm

Don't forget your insect repellant which we did but were able to buy some there. We got there about 45 minutes before opening but the first session at 7.30 pm was sold out and we waited until 8.30 pm. The express Tram ticket was $10 each but was well worth the cost when you saw the queue of everyone trying to get on the other trams. The show as great - very hot and everyone pushed together waiting to go into the arena. We really enjoyed the zoo at night - cooler and a great time."
,,It was okay- did not exceed my expectation.,2.0,,"I booked this tour thru contacting Night safari. Send e-mail Thursday night to see if there was any open spot for Friday & Saturday. Reply from them that there is no space, but Sunday- there is an opening. Reply back to them within 30 min on Thursday night. NO reply or follow up from them till late Sunday afternoon to say there was an opening and see if I am still interested to attend. Very disappointed on their lack of communication. The price of this tour was about 3x more than regular price. I expect some quick reply for email from them. I had to send 6 e-mails prior to reply back on Sunday evening. Tour itself was great. My tour guide was good, she was very excited to show us around. Looks like due to cancelation, I was re-booked with other family who were participating another private tour. Again, lack of communication here. We did not know what was going on. Over all - tour was ok. Nothing special or memorable where I would come again because I wanted to learn more about this Night zoo. Recommend for group of family who do not want to wait in long line and willing to spend about 3x higher than normal entrance fee. If you want to go - book them in advance and call (if you can) to see if reservation is possible."
,,Greta fun for the kids,5.0,,If wiht a family then this is a must do. The kids will love the Zoo and all of the interaction that is available. It is a little bit of travel to get there - but certainly worth it. And going at night simply adds to the fun. Highly recommended.
,,A night at the Safari,5.0,,"Good experience and was pleased with the way staff handle the immense crowd during the tram ride. The night show was cancelled due to weather conditions and hence was not able to watch it on time.
I wonder how the animals are always present at the same location under the light focused on them during all the rides almost. Mystical mystery on that part. But a wonderful experience and wonderful place. Good food also available for the dinner."
,,Day n Night Attraction,5.0,,"It takes time to go to the Night Safari area lying to north west of Singapore City but it took even longer to wait in queue to board the tram
Once started we kept our voices and camera flashes off and saw a wonderful lively world of nocturnal animals across globe
Families of tiger lions giraffes sambar gava rhino and what not
We ended up eating at ILU ILU"
,,It is good but very crowded,4.0,,"This is my second visit after 15 years. The concept is good but at night time, it was hard to see animals clearly. We came at 5.30pm (after visiting Singapore Zoo and River safari), had dinner there (the food is very expensive) and start queuing before 7pm. Once we were in, we queued for the tram hoping to see animals before it gets dark and also to avoid long queue. We read the review that people are queuing long time for the tram. After that we walked all the trails and saw the Creature of the Night show. We arrived just few minutes late but the door is closed because it is already full. The tram ride is okay, just a bit boring at the end, the walking trails are good but not see many animals because it is very dark. The show is great. We missed the fire show unfortunately because of timing we had to decide if we wanted to start queuing for the creature of the night show and miss the fire show or watched the fire show but risking missing the creature show because it is full. You should plan your timing before come. I recommend buying a bundle ticket with Singapore Zoo because it is very good."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"The actual attraction is great. They also have strollers for rent, so that was wonderful for me. I took the tram with my 1 year old, and we also did all of the walking trails. It can be a bit creepy, though. It was a very unique experience and we got to see lots of animal activity.
The restaurant staff was great as well.
The only issue I had was with the tram staff. When lining up for the tram, I was told to fold my stroller, and I had to drag it through the line. The staff could have easily taken it from me and set it aside until we got to the front of the line as there was space to the side of the line. Also, other local guests pushed their strollers through the line and only folded them once they got to the front. Additionally, when we got off the tram, no one could tell me where the stroller was. I finally found it laying on the ground at the front of the tram (we were all the way in the back.) This is ridiculous. Lots of families come here, so you would think they would do a better job trying to help out their guests.
I would definitely return, but they really need better staff or extensive training."
,,Too badly managed!,2.0,,"Was very excited to go here. Had an 815 time slot, however this meant we couldn’t even enter the park until then (I thought this was just for the tram part of the park, that we could still look and wander the trails while waiting... but no). Spent majority of time waiting In numerous lines. No proper management at all. No decent public transport to this venue so make sure you have a way to get there! Especially as it finishes so late.
the actual creatures show and tram ride were good, however we had spent so long in lines we left promptly. Would not go again, especially with children; what a nightmare!!"
,,Family outing,5.0,,We visited Night Safari as a family outing on Saturday night. One of the best safari i have visited. The night shows are suitable for all ages. We also like the tram ride as we do not need to walk so much. The exhibits of all the night animals were interesting. I like the information about the animal exhibits. A good night experience and good family bonding.
,,Must visit,3.0,,Although it was very crowded but the night safari tram ride was worth the wait. Was a nice experience. This place does not have any sitting place nor has any assistance with infants. That might be something parents might need to consider. I had to forcefully buy food to sit jn a restaurant inside it as there was no other place to sit.
,,Very crowded and not organised,3.0,,"We had been to night safari on the 22nd May 2018 for the 815 pm show, the earlier show members were allowed by 7pm, the second batch booked customers were asked to queue up 745 pm, we did, to our disappointment , when we’re finally allowed inside by 815, we still saw a big mob of 715 booked customers in the queue, I had called the call center and complained, finally after protesting I was allowed to board the team at 845 pm, very poor management of visitors and I think zoo authority is greedy to earn more money"
,,Out of this world experience,5.0,,"True experience of jungle, you feel as if you are real jungle and exploring the real habitats of wild animals, my family great time, tram ride is wonderful n convenient, animal show is good too. Must visit for families with kids."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,It was a thrilling experience and different from day safari I have done. Except for the rush and a bit of time constraints from my side it was very good.
,,A unique experience for an Aussie!,5.0,,"My husband and I really enjoyed the Night Safari. We had the Park Hopper ticket, and so visited the other zoos and both agreed that Night Safari was the best one.

We went on a weekday 9.15pm session. We arrived at 8ish so that we could wait in line. There are cute shops and heaps of places to eat as well as a fire show (you'll have to google times for this as i can't recall) so after we had a look around we stood in line at around 8.45pm. Even though it seemed like it was a huge line, the wait to get onto the actual safari bus wasn't too long so i suggest going for the latest session. We saw the line for the 8.15 session which was almost triple the size of the 9.15 one.

The safari itself is a good length, informative and fun. We got to see most the animals, but there were a few that were hiding or resting. Some animals are close enough to touch (but don't touch them!) which we thought was pretty cool.

Try and catch the Creatures of the night show. We actually weren't planning on going but we got back from the safari just as a show was starting and thought ""why not?"". We were super glad we went as its entertaining and the animals are adorable and the host was really funny!

We skipped the walking paths because we had just arrived that morning in Singapore and were too tired!

All in all, we enjoyed it. I think we got lucky with crowds, so if you can avoid them I think it would be a much more fun experience. If you've been to Sydney Zoo/Aquarium then I would even suggest skipping the other Zoos as the hot weather and amount of walking make it difficult."
,,QUEUE TOO LONG,3.0,,"The line queue is too long both for tram and the creatures of the night. There are people trying to get ahead of us in line, someone from your staffs should prevent this. People were running when the creatures of the night opened. IT IS NOT SAFE SPECIALLY FOR KIDS. OLD PEOPLE COULD BUMP THE KIDS AND CAUSE ACCIDENT. (PROBABLY BECAUSE 2 SHOWS ARE CANCELLED DUE TO RAIN)"
,,Amazing night visit with buffet meal,5.0,,"We loved the night zoo and the tour around on the little tram. The buffet meal was to a high standard with a great variety of food, including Indian. We had an hour to walk around the enclosures. It is an amazing zoo and a wonderful way to see nocturnal animals in fabulous surrounings, with a great and imaginative use of space"
,,Perfect,5.0,,"The enviorement for the animals is perfect, but sometimes his team was not organized. I will comeback"
,,Rather visit Singapore Zoo,3.0,,The experience was Okay-Okay I would suggest to visit Singapore Zoo instead of Night Safari.Nothing exceptional about this safari.
,,Great Night,5.0,,This was our second visit to the night safari. The first time we walked around but could not see a few of the animals . This time we went on the tram and it was brilliant. The only animals we didn't see were the wolves. I booked the tickets on line for the 9:15 tour. We got there early to have dinner. Glad we booked the 9:15 because the 7:15 and 8:15 times were very busy with families and tour groups. We missed the Creatures of The Night Show because we didn't know where it was. For the record it's after you go through for the tram ride. The zoo is very well set up. The lighting in the animals enclosures is like moonlight so it doesn't disturb the animals.
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"This tour had been recommended by friends and Trailfinders.
By paying for a tour a meal (very nice too) was included and we had priority so jumped the massive queues. However, the animals are difficult to see in the gloom and the land train on which you travel albeit guiding your view left or right they don’t stop long enough for you to search the semi-darkness to try and find the animals.
In effect this is nothing more than a theme park which may not be what you were or are expecting.
In hindsight I wouldn’t have bothered; it was very disappointing."
,,Wow,5.0,,Very good place to hang around at night the animals in light looks very nice and very good arrangement to see the animals.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"a must do in Singapore! So magical and exciting.

The tour makes you feel like you are on an adventure. You get to really see animals like you have never been before.

Tip - go late to avoid children. Try to get to the front of the train to hear extra guide information from the driver. If you end up at the back of the train you may miss seeing the full experience."
,,Night out,5.0,,"A night zoo is the first ever in the world when it was started many years ago. Now other places have copied the concept. However it is still outstanding and a great experience as well as safe. There is no chance that you get eaten by a tiger or a lion who roam the night,unlike in a safari park."
,,Excellent accommodating staff,5.0,,"My girlfriend and I were traveling from Canada and we heard great reviews about the night safari so we purchased tickets from our hotel and made our way down. Upon arrival we had some confusion with our tickets, at this point, Leslie (Manager of Park Operations) noticed the confusion at the gate and offered to sort things out for us. Leslie went well beyond the service either of us has received at other attractions. Leslie walked us through the entire ticket process and give us helpful insights on how to maximize our experience at the park, even spending some time in the park with us. This type of customer service is often lacking in other attractions. Leslie displays tremendous customer service ability and had great control of the situation. We were able to see all of the animals and shows in a timely manner.

Thank you."
,,Bats! 😍,5.0,,"What a great concept to see the nocturnal furry friends, in a way that does not harm them. Take the tram around and see the animals in their natural state, then walk around and see the animals in their habitats, and get very close to them.

Take in the amphitheatre display at the start. Superb staff show off some of the animals and very entertaining.

Excellent night out."
,,My favourite part of Singapore,5.0,,I have always been fond of animals so it was really nice doing this safari over night and seeing so many animals
,,Very dissapointing,1.0,,"Very low light conditions, not able to see animals clearly. Very poor experience. This is highly rated experience for which we got our friends but disappointed."
,,Night Safari with kids,3.0,,"Can't see some of the animals, a bit disappointed. overall kids still enjoy themselves during the show."
,,Innovative,4.0,,"Make sure you go for this unique safari at an off peak period. Well managed, cleverly done and worth the money. The compere is excellent, the animals are well fed and the train is comfortable. However, big crowds spoil the experience and they are then unable to manage. Allowed to take food for self consumption only. Worth a visit."
,,be on time,5.0,,"nice place to cover both zoo night safari and show you have to reach by 6.30 pm, or you have to take the next show which is little late"
,,Night Safari disappointing,3.0,,"My wife and I undertook a night tour with dinner included on a Thursday night. The best thing about taking a prebooked tour was that we had priority entry and boarding on the zoo bus.

Because the park is relatively dark it was at times difficult to see animals along the bus path. Taking photos can also be difficult with a strict no use of flash policy. You can of course walk other paths after the bus tour where you can get a little closer to the animals.

The zoo was very busy with tourists (crowds) and the queues for the bus were jlong. The restaurant itself had international food and that was actually quite good. They also offer water, tea and coffee as part of the package.

We though about returning to the park during daylight hours but after looking at the zoo map board, we realise see that we had seen most of the animals, if not more at our zoos back home in Australia.

Anyway, worth a look if you have the time."
,,Night Safari - a Must !,5.0,,After spending the day at the Singapore Zoo - we also stayed on for the Night Safari in the evening. We headed to the Creatures of the Night show first - and then had our train ride around the Night Zoo. There were many areas where the tram went past animals that were roaming free which was great to see - nice that they were so close to you. Although the queue for the tram ride seemed very long - it moved along quite quickly. Definitely a must do experience. You were able to roam around on foot after the tram tour - but after such a long day we decided not to - as we thought we'd seen enough on the tram ride. We also enjoyed having dinner at the Night Safari area prior to going in.
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Since this is the first & probably only Night Safari which is designed in a rain forest, you must visit with your family. The fourth minutes tram will take you around to all wild animals who are well kept. The recorded audio guide will help you understand & it’s very informative."
,,Value and experience,3.0,,Not that many interesting or exotic animal and many not visible during the visit. Not worth the fee. The zoo is more interesting since at least you can actually see the animals.
,,Night Safari Experience,5.0,,"It was an astonishing experience for me and my family. Most of the reviews we read before doing the night safari had mentioned that the chances are 50-50 to see all the animals as they might be sleeping inside their habitat. But, it wasn't true in our case. We almost saw all the animals in our night tour. My kids enjoyed the most."
,,Experience you wouldn’t want to miss,5.0,,Friends this is one experience you would not want your kids to miss. It was one amazing experience that my kid loved and extremely safe too
,,Avoid busy trams,2.0,,"I have done this safari before since I live in Singapore and when it’s not busy it is a nice experience. This was however a busy night an I wouldn’t recommend it. Ques were astronomical and even if they were efficient it was slow, hot and tiring, especially for kids since it’s late at night. Our tram was absolutely packed with lots of kids screaming so we could barely hear what was said. I could tell they needed to get back and board new passengers as quickly as possible because they raced through the safari not giving time to actually see the animals. Totally different pace compared to when we did it before. They shouldn’t sell as many tickets as the do. Avoid busy night (not worth the money) and go for the less booked nights/slots."
,,"Overly crowded and stressful, not worth its price at all",2.0,,"We are disappointed with how crowded it was and it was a Tuesday! The wait time was terrible. We couldn’t get into the shows because it was full. You used to be able to alight at one half of the tram route and take it again but this option was removed. It is really sad how Night Safari has become like this, it is not worth the expensive price. It used to be a leisurely and relaxing experience but not anymore."
,,Night safari Singapore,4.0,,"Loved the night safari in Singapore, although a bit better signage would have given it a better score. The use of ""you are here"" signs might have made things a bit easier considering you are walking around in the dark, alternatively, take your own torch"
,,Much improved night safari,3.0,,"This is the 3rd time I am revisiting night safari. The last trip was 3 to 4 years ago. This tram ride was alot more enjoyable as we can see and be real up close to some animals at their respective exhibit. We did not go for the walking trail due to time constraint. The disappointing part was my nephew never get to see the performance for the creatures of the night as it started to rain when we were seated at the galleria waiting for the show to start. We could not wait another hour for the next one., thus have to go home as we need to send my little nephew home early. The little fella was abit disappointed as well."
,,Could have been better ...,4.0,,"A good experience but could have surely been better ... Nevertheless,my 6 year old really had a great time ...We had bought the tickets for the 715pm entry... However, post reading some reviews and blogs before going for the Safari, thought of doing the fire dance show and the animal show at the amphitheatre first. Was a sensible decision as the number of people coming in really start swelling up with the passing of every minute. Were able to manage some sitting space at amphitheatre... However, the show was nothing great ... Not up to the level of what we've seen at other places and safaris ... But still okay for the little ones ... Then came the time to start queuing up for the tram ride and what a queue it was. Took us almost 45-50 minutes to get into the tram... Trams keep coming every 8-10 minutes but then people keep coming every minute. As if thats the only attraction in Singapore ... The tram ride itlsef was good n relaxing ... Good English commentary... Towards the end it starting raining but all was managed well... Overall, a good decent outing ... More for the kids outing ...
As for reaching the place, it's recommended to take a cab as the public transport is not very well linked. A combination of MRT and bus easily takes around an hour and half and it's not a comfortable transfer. However the cab takes around 20-25 minutes from Orchard Road and gets you down by around 20 SGD's..."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Had a great time looking at, and for animals while on the tram. The tour was well organised and the guide was enthusiastic about the telling of tales. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the wolves but saw all the others. There were plenty of food outlets"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Night safari is the best part of the entire animal experience
Large crowds ,long lines ,waiting for tram
Many animals shown in the night safari aren't covered in the zoo
Malaysian tapir ,variety of deers ,malay tiger, red coloured pigs ,Male Asian lions ,hippos ,hyenas ,jackals
The tram ride ,night setting ,chirping of insects ,open animal enclosures, soak in the experience
Kids love it
Someone short on time ,those doing short tours should opt only for the night safari ,can skip the zoo If short on time and definitely miss the crap river safari
The creatures of the night show is pretty decent ,large python, couple of otters ,owls ,wild cats ,a jovial hostess ..
You can't take many pictures in the night safari as camera flash is not allowed ,it disturbs the nocturnal animals..
Drizzle added to the fun ,also a tram breakdown in the middle of the safari
Indian tandoor restaurant has some good Indian food ,chicken tikka naan thali is good ,so is the veg biryani thali .."
,,Night safari is ok,3.0,,"Kids may enjoy little due to travel in tram at night time. The queue is too long and had to wait for more than 30 mins. If you are on short trip please visit Universal Studios, Sentosa and Gardens by the bay."
,,Singapore Night Safari.,1.0,,It was a total wastage of time and money... I will not recommend any one to go there .... and definitely I will not visit again Night Safari.
,,Must visit with kids,5.0,,Really nice set up Especially if traveling with young kids Option to walk around or take the tram I think tram ride first and then walk Lots of places to eat after trip But be aware it’s not cheap
,,It‘s an unique experience,3.0,,It's a nice place to take children but to be honest not very exciting but more unique. It was a cool experience however it was not as fun as I expected.
,,Excellent unique experience,5.0,,Had a great trip to the night safari. Animals were very active. Saw both shows (fire dancers and animals) which were both fantastic. Staff very friendly and park is well maintained. Very unique experience; highly recommend it.
,,Great experience,4.0,,We had a great time at the night safari. The team rode was very informative. Then we did the walk around the walking tracks. That was terrific. We saw the lions being fed. We got there by catching the MRT and then the 138 bus. It was very easy to do but took about an hour and a half. But much cheaper than doing a tour.
,,Nice experience,3.0,,"Well it is one of the unique experience, you have a tram ride in night and watch nocturnal animals, majorly you will find pigs, jackals, buffalo's and other common animals, it's just the experience you can enjoy. Don't worry about the mosquitos, you will not find even one there."
,,Just a complete disaster of organisation and not worth the bother,1.0,,If you enjoy hours of queuing in sultry evening heat and overpriced food and beverages prior to a bus tour of sleeping animals and awake deer this is the attraction for you!
,,I advise you not to take,1.0,,"The price is not true. Short Parking in front of the enclosures. Can only be considered the same type of animals - hoofed animals. Predators do not stand near the road, so they are difficult to see. Not interesting, expensive, difficult to drive from the city."
,,Zoo or circus ?,2.0,,A zoo with what of animals conservation should first have a profound respect for wildness and freedom. Didn’t like to be a part of the audience to watch the “show” on wild life and even why the night safar under lights on the cages ? What’s night safari id you are taking trams inside the zoo of caged animals . It’s sad that wilderness needs to be tamed for a show to entertain zoo guests. Better go for circus folks
,,Night Safari,2.0,,"Tram in front broke down causing a traffic jam, too many noisy inconsiderate people piled onto each tram, lights are so dim its hard to see really anything. Disappointing overall, Taronga zoo is still the best followed by San Diego."
,,World Class,5.0,,"If u have children make a trip. If u are there on business and r looking for something to do in the evening, try the NIght Safari, AWESOME."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The Night Safari was well worth the price and wait times! We saw an abundance of wildlife both during the tram ride and on the trail walks. The zoo is laid out in an easy to navigate manner and the staff are very helpful. However we did have tourists on our tram whom despite being told multiple times not to use flash photography continued to do so, causing staff to stop the tram to reprimand the group. Do not use flash photography!!!
The nightly show was worth watching and provided information about the animals and was highly entertaining.
Lines for the tram are quite long, if you do not wish to wait long times for an English speaking tram, I reccommend you pay the extra $10 to skip the queue. Overall a fantastic experience!"
,,Must Do!,4.0,,Kool experience. Close proximity to the animals. As to be expected some animals were not visible but in no way affected the overall experience.
,,disappointed,2.0,,"most of animals were sleeping or beyond the trees, and couldn't see them what we could see were deer-family only and honestly to say that was not what I expected"
,,The ride was too short and far away from the animals,3.0,,My kids are a bit disappointed. the entry fee was expensive and the line up to get in and get on the ride was really long. The ride too short and far away from the animals. Not really much to see. It was different than what I heard.
,,A different zoo experience,4.0,,"Having seen really great zoos in the daytime, decided to go for the Night Safari for something different and also to try to avoid the heat of the day cutting short our visit. We did visit a small part of a tour group, so that made it easier to get to/from the zoo. The bus trip took about 35 minutes from Chinatown. On arrival, went straight to restaurant for buffet dinner. The variety was good with western and Asian options, including dessert. Being with a tour did mean we had to stick to a tight schedule, so not too long to linger over dinner before we were off to the trams. Tour groups did not priority express onto the trams, which was great because there were lots of people there waiting! There were some educational shows but they seemed to fill up very quickly, so we did not even try for those. The tour on the tram displayed a variety of different animals, close view of tiger, elephants, flamingos. We also had time to walk one of the short trails, which allowed us to see some different animals than we saw from the tram. Reasonably priced merchandise in the shops as well, which was great. We did take insect repellant and used it, but did not notice an uncomfortable amount of insects anyway."
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"It's simply mind-blowing how they have arranged the night Safari. Get the train ride first, then the show and then walk around on foot through the different trails. Gives you the a near night jungle feel which is not to be missed."
,,Good night,4.0,,Really great place to go as long as you are Okay with the initial queuing. Very busy with dinner available but you do have to queue for food and drinks. Once inside the train ride is excellent with a very good commentary in English. More animals to see than at the zoo. Walking trails offer a chance to get fairly close to the animals. Excellent night out
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Too much waiting time. Even Though good felt that it was overrated. May be due to over expectation.
Too much waiting time. Even Though good felt that it was overrated. May be due to over expectation.
Too much waiting time. Even Though good felt that it was overrated. May be due to over expectation."
,,Excellent way to spend one evening in Singapore,5.0,,"Great for kids, impressed by being so close to the wildlife. Show in the amphitheater, in the beginning of the visit...not really worth it, but walking paths definitely!"
,,Fabulous Overview,4.0,,We highly recommend this tour. We did it on our first evening in Singapore and it gave us a ‘hop on hop off’ type tour but with the extras of a lovely dinner and then a Singapore Sling whilst enjoying the Marina Bay Sands light show.
,,A Night in the Tropics,4.0,,"Highly suggest you book your entrance time online. I wasn't aware of this and we were given 9:15pm entrance time!! Yikes, my grand daughter is only 18 months. Luckily we were allowed in by 8pm. We did all the walking trails first as the lines for the tram was packed. Overall a great evening...clocked 18,000 steps on my FitBit...pretty good for this 63 yr old grandma!"
,,Disappointed in the tram safari ride 🙊,3.0,,"The tram ride was very disappointing. The recording that explains about the different animals you are seeing is very low and hard to hear. There are three employees on the tram, the driver, and two other employees that tell you not to use the flash when taking pictures. They should be telling people not to talk, or be quiet so the other guests can have an enjoyable ride and listen to the recording describing the animals. People were also eating on the tram, and pointing and standing up, this also should have been addressed by the employees. We had families of screaming kids sitting near us and you could hear other guests yelling at these families, but nothing was done by the employees. Many of us sitting near these loud, yelling kids were very disappointed in the safari. We heard some guests even talking about wanting to get a refund. We saw many of the animals, although they weren’t behind fences and didn’t seem to move much. Maybe they are heavily sedated? The lions were being fed, and as food was being thrown right at them they barely moved not sure what that is all about? The only animal that was actually behind an enclosure was the tiger . The tram moved pretty fast, so there wasn’t much time to take pictures (without the flash) or get to look at the animals."
,,Exciting & fun evening,5.0,,"We reached just in time to line up for the night safari. (Approx 6:30pm) it opens up at 7 and gets busy pretty quick. We took a ride in the buggy and got to see the animals that were on that route, there is an option to walk the trails too in case you’re interested in taking a closer look at the other animals. Plenty interesting places to eat and the fire show was very exciting. Creatures of night show was great fun, kids enjoyed that the most."
,,Great evening,5.0,,Three of us visited this attraction and we all thoughily enjoyed the evening. We would recommended this to anyone visiting Singapore.
,,STAFF APPRECIATION,5.0,,"I would like to say how grateful I am for the staff in Night Safari who have been extremely helpful. Last April 21, I left some stuff at the River Safari locker and did not realize that the locker area closes at a designated time. The Night Safari staff Paul assisted me to help get my things and the security guard whose name I believe is Sri even lent me money to pay the machine because I did not have enough change. Even when I know that it was quite busy that day, they were able to accommodate me.

To those two staff I mentioned, thank you for being dedicated to your work. It is a great feeling to know that there are staff who are willing to help guests like me who are sometimes oblivious to small matters like this.

Thank you to the management also for being diverse in many ways. My family enjoyed their stay very much. Everyone was so friendly and sweet,

I wish you more success,"
,,Avoid at all cost,1.0,,"My family and I went to the night safari. This safari is a complete disgrace. You pay $44 per person to stand in a queue for 40 minutes to enter the park....then when you think you’re in, you’re not, you have to queue another 40 minutes to get the tram right after the entrance. By the time you get on the tram you’re quite annoyed. The actual attraction itself once you get on the tram is a joke, the tram drives way to fast to see anything, especially if you’re sitting in the back. To summaries the attraction, it’s simply, queue for most of the time and then drive around a fast tram in the dark park for 45 minutes. The whole place is poorly run and is just money spinner. Keep your $44."
,,Good sighting of creatures,5.0,,"We bought tickets for the first batch of entry (7.15), first completed the show of the day about the wildlife, worth viewing. Then straight away moved towards the Tram ride for a round across the park. It is good experience with the guide explaining about the next animal we are going to see. To our luck we could see animals in almost all the areas we passed by. It is a strange feeling seeing dangerous animals sitting at stone throw away distance without cage and we travelling in an open tram.
If after finishing the ride you need more time, you can go for a few walking treks (though we avoided as we had a long day after completing Jurong Bird Park and Zoo earlier in the day). There are personnel stationed along these treks to guide you through."
,,Not sure its worth it...,3.0,,"We were visiting Singapore for a few days and heard that the best way to see the city was to use the Hop On / Hop Off (HO/HO) Bus tours, so we bought the 2 day pass. What does this have to do with the Night Safari at the Zoo? Read on.

In order to leverage our Bus Pass, we decided to take the HO/HO Bus to the Zoo for the Night Safari. Since the last HO/HO Bus left the zoo at 10pm, we needed to finish our Night Safari by then, this left us with the 7:15 show or 8:15 show. By the time we got around to booking our Night Safari reservation, the 7:15 show was sold out, so we were left with the 8:15 show.

Now its also important to know that the HO/HO bus runs on the hour, so we took the 7pm HO/HO Bus, which takes 45 minutes to get to the zoo and arrived at 7:45pm. There was already a line for the 8:15pm Night Safari, so we got into line and waited a half hour until the gates opened at 8:15pm. Once the gates opened, we proceeded to a Disney-like line and snaked back and forth for another half an hour until we were finally allowed to board the tram at 8:45 for the 45 minute ride.

OK, so the Tram ride was pretty good. Almost all of the animals that were supposed to be out, were out. I think there were two animals we missed, the wolves and a bear, so that was pretty good. Some of the wildlife (deer and cows) are not fenced in and are free to wander right up to the Tram, which is also pretty cool.

So the Tram rides ends at 9:30 and we have to rush back to try and get to the HO/HO Bus. Given the timing of the above schedule, we were not able to take advantage of the walking tours or the shows. So basically we were left with a 45 minute bus ride, to get in line for an hour, to take a 45 minute tram ride and then an hour bus ride back.

Lessons learned, don't combine the HO/HO Bus with the Night Safari. Probably best to take a different form of transportation and go earlier in the day so that you can enjoy the entire zoo in the daylight. It looked like a great zoo and we were only able to see a small part at night, so it might be worth spending the day at the zoo and finishing up with the 7:15pm Night Safari, which I suspect many people did."
,,Great way to spend an evening - loads of animals!,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari on the recommendation of a friend who lives in the city. We weren't disappointed - an amazing number of animals were up and about and clearly visible from the narrated trolley tour that takes you around the park. Animals included lions, leopards, elephants, rhino, deer etc. There are also four walks that you can do on completion of the trolley tour that allow you to spend more time at some of the enclosures looking at the animals. It's advisable to take insect repellent! Once you are done with the animal viewing then there are lots of food and drink choices. Getting to and from the Zoo is relatively cheap from central Singapore in an Uber/Grab taxi (around £15 each way). Allow 2.5-3 hours for your visit."
,,Charlie Graylish,3.0,,"We did the safari on our last night in Singapore . It was ok but far to crowded . They clearly let to many people in so the queues for everything are horrendous.
We did the guided tour on the tram to see the animals . They kept asking over a tannoy for people to be quiet and not use a flash on their camera but nobody paid any attention . So consequently all you could hear were people chatting not the sound of the animals !!!!
Would I recommend ??? Yes but bear in mind that it’s not a zoo as we know in the Uk"
,,Great Fun!,5.0,,"The creatures of the night show is a must watch - lots of beautiful animals being showcased. Loved the tram ride as well as we were able to see many animals close-up, reminiscent of an actual safari. My 10 year old Nephew who was visiting Singapore enjoyed himself as well."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"We visited the Night Safari with our kids. It was dark (of course), and the kids were quite scared, especially when we went to take a look at the bats... I was scared too...At first, we took the tram. As flash was not allowed, and on a moving tram, all photos could not make it. That was a despair, but reality. Then we went to watch the show. It was quite simple really, and we walked the trails by ourselves. Not too bad... It would be good if there are shuttle busses available at night."
,,Good but too crowded,3.0,,Nice experience but just too many people. They could split better the timing or create additional schedule. It takes twice the time queuing than actually enjoying the place
,,Always enjoyed night safari Singapore,5.0,,"This is my third time but my first with the kids ages 3 and 4 to the night safari. Kids really enjoyed all the activities available. Tram ride, very educational and the narrator was clear explaining the animals. The trail, was fun and exhilarating to explore with the kids at night. We could see all animals clearly. And finally the show. What an amazing performances by the staff and the animals. Staff was really friendly and helpful to accommodate my needs. Great place!"
,,Night Safari Viait5,3.0,,Found it to be ok as the trip was mainly in dark areas and not clearly visible. I feel the attractions has to increase and needs to have more light areas for clearer visibility.
,,Amazing zoo,4.0,,Great evening visiting the animals. Well kept zoo with friendly and knowledgable staff. Would recommend a visit.
,,Bad experience,2.0,,We have visited to night safari as last saturday. we found the environment is so dark and cannot really enjoy to see the animal. what a bad experience as that was my first met with my girlfriend after 3 months.
,,Night safari,3.0,,"Lovely idea for this hot environment. We usually go on daytime, but had visitors who avoided the hot day activities. Personally, we prefer to go during day times, as it is less crowded, we can walk through the zoo and the tickets are cheaper. At night time, we went on a Sunday evening before a public holiday on Tuesday. It was very crowded, we had to queue 45 minutes for the train and felt the waiting area were quite hot. Next time we will go in the morning again.
Food options in the evening are of bigger variety and quality a bit better, but we feel price-value for what you get not in a balance."
,,What an awesome place!,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the night zoo as a family of four with kids aged 10 and 12. We got to see some fabulous animals while we did all the walking tracks but missed the tram ride in order to see the creatures of the night show. It was well worth it, the show was fantastic. Loved it!"
,,we visited the night safari,3.0,,"the visit was nice but we thought it will be longer that this we waited in a que for more than 30 mins and the night safari will not take more than an hour , if you have time visit the morning zoo and the river safari instead of the night safari"
,,Totally worth it!,5.0,,This is one of the coolest experiences I've had on vacation! It's a rare opportunity to see animals in their nocturnal state. I love that you could ride the trolley and explore on foot. I'd highly recommend this to anyone traveling to Singapore!
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,I was very satisfied with Night Safari in Singapore zoo. I was really impressed by that there’re so many endangered species and that I could see very close to them. Night trek was also exciting. I wonder whether my wife was satisfied with it or not.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"It is not like visiting the regular zoo during evening and night hours. This is a separate attraction, right next to the Singapore Zoo, full of all the nocturnal animals. The park's lighting has been specially designed to be only as bright as the full moon, and since animals are used to that, they are awake and active. Photography with flashlight is strictly prohibited. Since most of the animals are moving their photographic images are blurred. As one enters the park, welcome counters extend assistance. There are restaurants and gift shops also. The mood is built up by the Thumbuakar performance as pyro warriors demonstrate their fire-twirling skills to the beat of jungle drums.
We took the Tram ride and came across flamingos, a variety of deers, giraffes, hyenas, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs, tigers, etc.
We could not enjoy the walking trails.
We enjoyed the Creatures of the Night Show in which Mongoose, Binturongs, Owls, Fishing Cats, Hyena, Fennec fox, Python demonstrated their respective talents."
,,All you need to know about Night Safari,3.0,,"* It is very far from city centre, it takes minimum 1 hour 30 mins from Bugis street.
* It is very crowded even on weekdays, we reached at 7:40 pm then also we got 9:15 PM entry slot.
* Fire show happens at the entrance only , you can enjoy it even in the queue for the entrance . Same show gets repeated every 1 hour .
* Animal show was ok , not so amazing as we expected. This show is on first come first serve basis. Even if you are in the queue it does not mean that you would be able to make it .
* Tram ride was the most attractive part , but if you are from India don’t expect much as most of the animals are from India Only and you must have seen them already in Indian zoos .
* over all experience was ok . Don’t expect much out of it , i would say it’s not value for money"
,,good place for families,5.0,,Having dinner after a night safari tour of zoo with families is enjoyable & it has a no. of food joints
,,Must Watch..Must Watch...,5.0,,"Before Travel : Night Safari reviews what i read mostly are on either long queue outside or fro tram or no animals seen or mosquitoes. So, i was really worried as i did not wanted my 12 year daughter to stand in a queue for 45 minutes. But accepted as no other option.

On Travel Day: Just Perfect. We booked online ticket so no queue for ticket. At the information desk i found ""Express Tram"" ticket available at different time intervals. Once you take express tram ticket no queue for tram, directly you board on your specified time. Started with fire dance at the entrance while others were in queue. Once we finished that around 7 pm no queue at the entrance and went directly inside. Started with walking trails till 7:45 PM. 8:00 pm boarded the express term, all the animals we could see, super experience. 8:50 pm around completed the tour and sat down for the creature show, show was at 9:30 pm, so we were the first one there. Show was super, not to miss. We family of three with 12 years old kid had a great time here. Dinner was also good and you get taxi to go back to city."
,,Good,5.0,,Nice experience though the animal species are mostly Indian. But travelling through the forest in a team in the night is something great.
,,A Zoofari - must-see,4.0,,"Your different kind of Zoo! We booked a skip-the-line ticket and hopped on the Express Tram that took us around the zoo. Very interesting to see the animals in this unusual setting. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to check out all the walking trails, but the ones we did were very interesting and it had a adventurous feeling to it, walking around with all the sounds and noises ... a must-see in Singapore!"
,,Unique night zoo,5.0,,"This is the first time we visited a night zoo where you can see the nocturnal animals when they are active. We have been to many zoos and this is the first and only one we know of that allow visitors to see animals at night. For example, we got to see 10 otters being extremely happy, running around and making noises like birds. Very impressed with the night zoo as part of the Singapore zoo."
,,Ok,3.0,,Bit mah. Went after spending a day in the zoo next door and was disappointed. Animals all asleep whilst we went round. I know I know. It’s night time but the whole point is to see nocturnal animals isn’t it?
,,Very good,4.0,,Its a nice place but i think its even better at night. Essentially the same place transforms in the famous Singapore Night Safari.
,,Great night!,5.0,,The tour guide took great care to make this a great experience. It was during rainy season so she worked hard to ensure we could see the animals.
,,A positive surprise,5.0,,I guess this is the closest you get to a real safari in a zoo. First we had a nice ride through the park and then we wandered around by our selfs. The animals seemed to be in good shape and have good space. A positive experience!
,,Night Safari is unique zoo experience,4.0,,"This is a unique and fun night out while in Singapore. The zoo is well set up and offers guests a number of dining options that can be used before the tours start. A taxi from central Singapore will set you back between $25-35 each way which means this is not a cheap night out, but well worth doing if money is not an issue."
,,Pleasant and Surprising,4.0,,"Night Safari is a wonderfully created and maintained property.

It has 3 broad segments.

1. Animal Show - This is by far the best segment. It has a carefully orchestrated show that has splendid performances by the animals. They are trained and well cared for. You will find them appearing out of nowhere and also among you but never will you fear or get scared. It is indeed a wonderful and not to miss part.

2. Train ride - this takes you a train ride of the entire place. You will get to see all the animals from a distance. The voice announcements give you an explanation of the animals that you see which is very informative.

3. Trek - you can choose to walk down the entire place. You can see the animals from close and spend as much time as per your liking. Take this if you have sufficient time at hand.

Place has decent options for food and refreshments. Drinking water is available without a problem."
,,An animal sanctuary,5.0,,This park (not zoo) is a wonderful place to see extraordinary creatures from around the world. Great fun and educational.Thanks Bob
,,night safari singapore,5.0,,"It was amazing, as if all the animals came out for us. I would recommend walking around and then taking the bus/train tour."
,,Different interaction with animals,5.0,,Really unique way to see animals in there natural habitat and a great mix with the tram and walking tracks. My two young ones loved it after a nervous start when they thought everything was just roaming! Was a great trip and really recommend it!
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,It is a unique experience to animals at night. I have not seen such in my home country in Malaysia. I would be great if we can see the tigers and lions closer.
,,Something different,4.0,,"Lovely time with my toddler...loved looking at the lions, elephants, deer etc in the dark, on the tram ride (we got there just before opening and were on the tram just before sunset). He had fallen asleep by the time we got to the show but my husband and i enjoyed. Not really necessary to walk around the zoo after the tram ride as you see most on the tram but we did a quick walk anyway which was a waste of time as couldn't see much in the dark. Would recommend to others."
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,4.0,,"I have visited Singapore a few times and finally got to visit the night zoo on my trip this month. We really enjoyed the safari train ride past the various animals. It was very well organised. They were sometimes hard to see as there was not much light (obviously) and some of the animals stayed to the rear of their enclosure. despite this, we did get see many of the animals and even got to take a few photos."
,,Good visit,5.0,,Nice option for the ones who visit Singapore .. I had a night safari in the very first day of my tour. English language safari guide.. Photography is allowed with out flash lights
,,Great Night Out,4.0,,"This trip was highly recommended by many people so my partner and I journeyed up one night. Arriving at the zoo was fairly easy taking the MRT to Khatib, and the shuttle from Khatib to the zoo entrance. As we had not booked online we followed the signs to the ticket office and paid there. There was a little confusion regarding entrance times, which could have been clarified by an easier to read website, but in essence each time slot is filled in and you can enter at the time slot allocated to you or later. To save time It would have been easier if we had booked online.
However, waiting was not bad, there are a few small eateries, serving food of the standard you normally see at zoo's, not really exciting, but good enough. To pass the time a rather excellent fire show is performed, which is worth viewing.
The zoo layout is easy to follow on foot, and you should have enough time to see all the exhibits and still have a ride on the tram. My recommendation would be walk first then tram later, as everyone rushes to the tram to be first.
The staff in the zoo were extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and I would recommend asking them a few questions as you get the feeling they really enjoy there night.
Overall this was a fantastic experience and well worth the visit."
,,Wide Variety,4.0,,"Wide variety of animals, some of the exhibitions were closed so was a bit disappointing.

The night safari is a must though you get to have a real safari experience would would recommend as a must as a tourist. The Leisure cruise was a bit boring, I recommend a fan as it is a bit hot and sticky on the boat. The rain forest one was not bad but rather short.

Its a great place for kids and adults and has something for everyone."
,,More of a Night horror than a safari!,1.0,,"Having nice memories of the Night Safari I did about 18 years ago, I wanted to do one with my family. As we arrived there, we wanted to leave right away again, because there were thousands of people and all of them standing in row to get to the night safari! I thought we could just get a ticket and enter but the tours were booked out for the next 2 hours. Standing in the ticket queue I managed to book a ticket online, for a tour starting earlier. After that we had to stand in queue for another 45min to get on one of the trains! This attraction is just overbooked and not worth doing anymore. We more enjoyed the night walks through the zoo. It was much more relaxing and we could better spot the animals."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"If you decide to do this keep an eye on the weather. The night we went was the only night we had rain while we were in Singapore and it rained so hard for an hour or so that when we had to get on the train ride as you are booked on a time the animals were all hiding because of the weather so we could not see any. We then tried to get into one of the shows there and after lining up with hundreds of other people were told it was cancelled as there had been lightening. We were all asked to get out of the line and come back for later show. When we came back for the next show we were then told it was full and missed out again, Left just after that as we had had enough."
,,Night Safari - Nocturnal Animals,5.0,,"Great experience! Nice show, nice team! It was fun walking in the zoo at night knowing some animals are just nearby without any fence or barrier installed. A must see in SG. Just don't take pictures with flash!"
,,Safari in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"The night safari is well worth a visit when travelling to Singapore and is recommended as part of the attraction pass, including zoo and river cruise. The night safari has many attractions and shows, which you can experience in the trams or by foot. Walking allows you to see all the animals at your own pace, however the area is quite expansive so you need good walking shoes. The tram ride takes you into a free range area that is not accessible by walking and the animals can be viewed in an open environment. Not all animals can be seen, however that didn’t detract from the experience. It would be better to have tram stations scattered around the night zoo to allow guests to get off and on in different parts of the safari, which is available in the zoo. I recommend this attraction when visiting Singapore."
,,Fun for animal lovers!,5.0,,"To start off, if you're not keen on nature and animals, you may not enjoy it as much. Also due to this being at night, it is definitely not an opportunity to take nice and clear pics of animals. However, being surrounded by animals in the dark definitely gave it such a different feel and experience to a normal zoo visit, and which I loved! There is a tram ride which gives you around 40mins whistle stop tour around the zoo where you get to see some of the main animals. There are also designated walking routes designed for specific animal species which you can do at your own pace. Walking in the dark felt like I was actually walking within the wildlife, and not surrounded by cages and exhibits.

If you are interested in wildlife and nature, i highly recommend it. As mentioned at the start, if you're not then you may not enjoy it as much but I still feel it is worth going, as it was a completely different experience to just your regular zoo visit!"
,,Fun trip to do.,4.0,,We went to the first session for the night with our daughters aged 7 and 9. We were ushered off to a live animal show first. I think now it would have been better to queue first for the bus to tour around the zoo. Our youngest was tired after waiting a significant amount of time to get o. The open bus. So we did not walk around amongst the animals. I did not realize just how busy it would be and that we would have to queue once inside. You couldn’t take photos with flash when in the bus. The kids enjoyed it none the less.
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"Well organised, show was amazing. Animal safari was a different experience to a conventional Zoo visit. Highly recomended"
,,Fantastic night of fun,5.0,,"Great night of fun, highly recommend this tour to all, very well organised tour staff had a heap knowledge."
,,Singapore night safari,4.0,,Really enjoyed the experience at Singapore zoo night safari I think that the zoo is very well kept and the enclosures are close to the animals natural habitat. Would of been a little more enjoyable had there been less people it was extremely busy.
,,Somewhat disappointing due to lack of variety,3.0,,"We caught a taxi to the zoo from central Singapore city at a cost of $30 (with a tip). The place is extremely well organised, excellent signage, numerous good outlets and shops and instructions blasted through loudspeakers in English re where to line up for entry etc.
We first went to the “Creatures of the Night” show which a female staff member compered, and we really enjoyed it as there was lots of audience interaction and a variety of animals to see. The same however could not be said for the trolley ride to see animals - we saw loads of deer, which I can see at home, in the wild. Yes we saw elephants, and a giraffe, and we went quickly past the tiger enclosure, however the trolley travels quickly and none of the photos I took were clear enough to actually see the animals. I found it rushed, and it lacked variety. Although it was well organised, and a beautiful garden area, I wouldn’t go again at night."
,,very bad,1.0,,"did not like it and all say that it is very bad zoo. not recommend. your commercial is deceiving. animals only goats and deer, other animals not in sight"
,,Free Pass on your Birthday,4.0,,"Night safari provides free entry if you visit them on your birthday + 7 days, provided you enter with another paying guest. We walked the trail and it took about 2h before we joined the Creature of the night show. I would recommend animal lovers to give the night safari a visit especially if its during your birthday week!"
,,I wish we had more time!!!,5.0,,We took a tour to the night zoo which was convenient for transport but it gave us only a couple of hours at the park. The trolley ride was great but once we finished the ride and watched the creatures of the night show it was time to go home. I would have loved some more time to do the walking trails. So overall I loved the night zoo but if I was going again I would definitely make sure I had more time.
,,Not as exciting as we had hoped.,2.0,,"We were collected from hotel by a shuttle bus service that was half-hour late only to be placed on a coach for an hour out of the city (which we were totally cool with because we were excited for the zoo).

Once we finally arrived we went on a train that took us on a tour of the park - couldn’t really see much as it was pitch black darkness, it felt more like a ride than an actual tour because we hardly could see anything and were asked not to turn on any lights as it might scare the animals - fair call and that would have been perfectly reasonable had their been any animals in sight.

We did see the big white lion and elephants but again, it was very faint as it really was pitch black darkness.

You were given the option to go for a walk around certain parts of the park so we did only to find the main area (and only area) you had to get a little train from back to the main entrance was jam packed with hundreds of people. - this isn’t good when you need to be back on a coach at a certain time.

After we finally arrived back to the entrance we decided to get a bite to eat and 1 smallish sized burger and coke was around $30AUD.

So overall, I’d say save your pennies and go to a day zoo where you can actually see the animals."
,,The 1st night zoo in the world!,5.0,,"Fun for the whole family no matter the age, kids adults and even elderly. Staff are all well trained and friendly. Animals are well taken care of and many many types. Good to go every time you are in Singapore"
,,Not a lot to see,3.0,,"very crowded, wait a long time to get on train. Not that many animals to see, pre recorded commentary. The stage show was the better aspect of the show but the whole experience, including getting to the zoo was very hum drum"
,,Very good. My kids love it . They love tram ride. Show was also good particularly snakes and owl.,5.0,,More aircond and fans would be good during wait time. Wondering if wait time can be made less longer or more efficient.
,,Long lines and animals,4.0,,"We purchased our tickets online to avoid queuing when we got to the park, more on that later.
We managed to get an express bus from Khatid MRT station - the bus was awesome, straight from the MRT to the park, it was brilliant, unfortunately the bus only runs until 7:20pm, so you can't catch the same bus back to the station.
Even with our online tickets there was a long line to actually get into the park. So we waited in line for about 20 minutes, and it moved along slowly. At the front of the queue there was a long line of turn-styles, but this evening they were only operating 3. I guess this must have been a quiet night.
There were a lot of mixed messages about when the park opens. Some said 7, others said 7:15, and then there were messages about 8:15 and even 9:15. Firstly, getting your ticket scanned at the turn style doesn't mean the park is open, it means you are herded into a staging area but the gates are still closed. At this point people naturally join another queue for the tram ride. The tram ride queue looked really long and slow, we didn't join that queue, rather we went straight for the walk way. There are about 3 trams, each tram probably carries about 60 people, and the trams run maybe every 5 minutes. If you have 600 people waiting in that queue it will take about 50 minutes to clear. That's a lot of waiting around.
Also, once inside the park there is no food or drink available - it would pay to bring your own water and snacks. Actually, there is the Zebra Cafe, it has a selection of yoghurt based drinks but very few other choices.
We spent a couple of hours on the walk way eventually arriving back at the tram stop, there was now no queue so we jumped onto the tram to finish off the evening.
The walkways go places the trams don't go, and the trams go places the walkways don't go. So to see the whole park you need to do both. I recommend doing the walkway first and the tram ride at the end.
If you book as part of tour group there are privileges. Firstly there is a speed queue to avoid those turn styles. The tour groups I saw all went off very quickly on the walkway - and they were fast - not a lot of time to see the animals. Those tour groups were also noisy, and that matters when you have some noise-shy animals. A few times we were able to wait quietly and then the various animals would re-emerge from the undergrowth.

Overall the animals were interesting, I particularly loved the sloth like animals, they were quite amazing. There were a few times where we coincided with feeding time, and these were excellent. I think there are some logistical improvements the park could make to improve the experience for visitors, like extending the express bus hours, including more food and drink options at the Zebra Cafe, reviewing the park entrance process and rethinking the tram ride queue."
,,Great night,4.0,,"If you want to miss the long hot queue book the zoo package that picks you up at your hotel. Add the dinner to it too. It was a great night not worrying about getting there, a fantastic buffet dinner and then the ease of no queue to get the train. Kids and adults will love this. Some animals are difficult to see so be prepared for that. Photos are OK without a flash. Don’t bother, just enjoy the experience!"
,,Awesome Night safari,4.0,,"best time to visit night safari is on the evening at 7:00 pm and it will be more fun and enjoyment for you and your family if you book a maxi cab from the Big taxi website.
They have all type of facilities for better comfort you in your tour. Drivers are also well mannered and they speak English very well. I enjoyed very much in Night safari just because of Big taxi Singapore assistance."
,,As close to nature as you'll get in Singapore,4.0,,"Visited this (AGAIN!) in April 2018, simply as its one of the 'must see' atrractions in Singapore, and - there are many.

Now - be advised, personally I don't have any photographs. Flash photography is banned, and rightly so - so be advised on that in advance.

It can be slightly 'awkward' to get to by MRT, and that means getting a bus from Ang Mo Kio MRT station. There are direct open top buses - and they are an attraction in themselves."
,,Long queues,3.0,,"The safari is nice but you have to wait around 60 min, minimum to take the train... the proximity with the animal is nice but you cant see all of them. Some are well hidden."
,,Good but not in the rain,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari and it was well organised with lots of transport. However, as it was raining we saw very few animals and to me was mostly a waste of time. I believe if the weather is fine then it might be good."
,,Woow,5.0,,We visited the xoo and didthe night safari. Both were amazing. Loved the proximity with the animals and the mini train hop on hop off option.
,,Thrilling Experience,4.0,,"Went there on the 1st Day of trip, it was worth the money spent. We opted for the Last Slot of the day and it was still a lot of people around.

The whole experience was of approx 2 hours and it was fun.
Open Coach ride was the best part of the trip."
,,An expensive but good night out,4.0,,"Took my 11 and 12 year olds. Massive cues (line if you are American). It’s always very crowded. Despite this I’m good Singaporean way they manage the crowds well. Go there rested as there is a lot of waiting and standing. However there is a little show that you can see whilst you wait. Also good idea to walk and not only take the little train. My kids loved the walk as it felt real. The train is a bit more construed and you feel as though you are been told everything. If you like to feel more adventures do the walk. We did both but frankly the walk would have been good enough.

Don’t buy food there. It’s expensive. Take Water as it’s hot and humid and you need to keep hydrated."
,,Zoo,1.0,,"We now understand why there is no photos on search for this place the team goes to fast for u to get photos they come out blurry, I won’t be going back it’s kinda a waste of money"
,,A Jungle in the City,5.0,,We spent an evening at the Night Safari. So many animals shown from a 40 minute tram ride. Also recommend the Creatures of the Night Show.
,,Only of the best trips,5.0,,"We had already been to the zoo a few days before and went for the Safari. We got the hypo bus out at 6pm and back at 9:40. The safari is actually open until 12:00am and if you are close or can afford a private transfer I would do that as slightly rushed to get round being tied to the bus. It also stopped everywhere going back and was an open aired bus which on the top deck was interesting / fun on a motorway.

Anyhow back to the Safari. It was amazing. Tip avoid the tram as big queues and you don’t get close to the animals. Head straight for the show then the walking trails. The walking trials are close to the animal enclosures and you really feel almost like you are in a Kenyan game park camp apart from you know the animals are in an enclosed zone. The animals are alert and nocturnal ones active. We were lucky to tag behind a game keeper that was feeding so brilliant. Really enjoyed the bat walk through with swooping fruit bats around you. There were quite. Few places to eat but we didn’t have time to stop there due to the bus.

Has to be a must do on any Singapore trip! Would definitely go back and better than the day zoo which is a separate entrance and area to the night safari."
,,Unique exprience,4.0,,"Different experience altogether of seeing animals at night. There are open coaches through which you travel and pass by different animals belonging to different regions.One of the highlights was white lion. Only problem was long queues to get into the coaches, approx waiting time of 40 min."
,,Seeing animals come alive at night,4.0,,"Visitors usually couple a visit to the Night Safari with a day-time visit to nearby Singapore Zoo. The latter closes at around 6:00 PM, just in time for you to cross over to the Night Safari. We had our tickets bought on-line in advance, but there was already a long queue as early as 6:00 PM waiting for the place to open at 7:15 PM! Anyway, the line moves quite fast once the doors of the Night Safari are opened.

Before taking the tram and roaming along indicated trails in the night zoo (namely, the Fishing Cat trail, the Leopard trail, the Wallaby trail, and the East Lodge trail), you might as well go straight to the amphitheater to watch the ""Creatures of the Night"" show first. The venue has limited seats, so try to be there ahead of other visitors. The show lasts for about 25 mins.

Outside the night zoo (near the main entrance) there's another show ... the Thumbuakar Performance featuring fire dancers. In the same area you'll find a chain of restaurants where you can consume dinner before heading back home. You can also drop by the gift shop for a last minute shopping. The Night Safari closes at 12:00 MN."
,,Different experience,4.0,,"Most of the times we have seen animals in day light, but this was a totally different experience watching animals at night. Well organised and comfortable travel by the tram. The shows could have been much better, slightly disappointed"
,,Animals so much more active at night,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed our evening. Animals were much more active at night compared to seeing them during the day. Highly recommend to book a tour out of Singapore as your groups skip the long queues and get straight on the trams. Trams could stop longer. recommend to sit at front of tram as guide will spot animals for you (ours didn't talk over the microphone so couldn't tell others further back)
,,Night Safari and Fire Dance,4.0,,Recommend the night safari. You ride in a tram car with narration. After you can walk around. We saw the Wallabies and Hippos being fed. Animals are out at night due to daytime heat. Areas have lightning so you can view the animals. There is an included Fire Dance which is quite good. Call for showtimes.
,,Nice but could be better,4.0,,The concept is very nice and unusual. It might be better to have slightly longer stop especially so the Young children have time to properly see the animals in the night.
,,Professionally Done,5.0,,Enjoyable experience for adults & kids. Good to be able to walk as well as sit on the tram. Well organised.
,,"Day, River Cruise and Night Safari",3.0,,A very tiring day and it is worth paying for a tram ride. We did some one foot and some on the tram then did the river cruise and the night safari and felt the night safari via tram was worth doing.
,,Think Singapore Think Safari,5.0,,"Your trip to Singapore is incomplete without Night Safari....my 2nd trip to Safari.
Singapore Zoo & Night Safari are nearly, so one should plan accordingly. Visit zoo in the morning or afternoon and after 6pm visit night Safari...there are many shows but the best one is the fire show.
It's little expensive then zoo tickets but probably it's worth visiting.
Tram ride (night Safari) is not to be missed where guests can actually hear the sound and see the animals closely in the dark.
Tram drivers always warn the passengers not to flash the mobile camera as the animals during dark get distracted and disturbed.
If your really want to enjoy the tram ride, I request every guest to switch off their phones and enjoy the moment.
Singapore night Safari team clicks your photo during the trip & they'll show you at the end of the ride."
,,So much better than we expected!,5.0,,"We did the Night Safari with an organised tour - slightly more expensive, but definitely worth it as we didn't have to queue or wait for a single thing. Our tour guide told us before the tram ride not to expect to see every animal, as obviously if they are sleeping or hiding out of sight that's just bad luck. We saw every single one! The audio on the tram was engaging and very informative. The creatures of the night show was greatly entertaining and interactive. This was the highlight of our time in Singapore!"
,,Fun time,5.0,,"It was the first night of our trip to Singapore when my husband and I decided to go for Night Safari. We took the MRT and then the bus to reach there ( you can find Singapore maps in various MRTs - these are really convenient ). There is an entrance fee for the Night Safari. I would highly recommend you to take a pass of 3 attractions (ask at the counter) together as it would be cost effective and you would anyways end up visiting the rest 2 attractions as well. We reached there just in time to see the fire show. It was breathtaking and all the artists did a fantastic job. We then went on to see the animal show. If you are with kids, they will definitely enjoy this one (we did too by the way :p). Then, we took the guided train ride of the entire area. There are various trails too where you can see the animals at arm’s distance while walking through their habitat. We were too tired to walk so we took the train. It was a very informative and thrilling ride. We went back content to our hotel using a cab. In Singapore you have to bear a surcharge in cabs after midnight. So plan your trip accordingly. Also try enrolling for Grab or Uber as this will help you get a nice discount on your first cab ride there."
,,We were so looking forward to this,3.0,,"We were a little disappointed in this tour, however we did enjoy the Creatures of the night show. Thought it was a little pricey for what it was. I remember doing this back in 2006 and loved it, however this time, not so much."
,,Great attraction to see animals at night,5.0,,Spent the day at the zoo and at the river safari. There are a number of eating places outside the attraction before entering. Had 715 entry to safari but they started entry before this. Visited the creatures if the night show on the right before taking the safari tour and then the walking trails. Unquie experience.
,,Nightzoo - lovely experience,5.0,,"Book a trip to the nightzoo, amazing evening when you can see the animals in the dark.we went with a open bus from the city to the zoo and back, everything organized well and punctual."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"It was a good experience, Tram ride was great and informative. But expected a bit more from the ‘creatures of the night’ show , a lot of tiny animals even no monkeys."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,The Night Safari is also suitable for people who are wheel chair bound. The service provided by Zainul was really good as he rendered assistance to my mum who was wheel chair bound. The male lions and elephants look really majestic. Some animals really come very close to us. Good experience.
,,Great evening,5.0,,Really well organized. Fun family night out. The show could do with an update but it was informative and fun. The trails are a great addition. We were lucky and saw lots of animals. 7pm time slot sounds like it’s best as I’ve heard animals are more active then.
,,Great visit....,5.0,,"We were in a party of 6 and used our tourist tickets to travel from downtown to the zoo. It takes an hour or more using the mrt and bus service. We travelled back by cab 60 $s. Well worth it. The safari was great, our party were all sat together on the land train. The lighting was so good that it seemed you were almost in with animals. A truly must go to attraction."
,,Kids will love it,4.0,,Not a natural way to see animals..its def wotth visiting if your with kids will love it. This place had buffet dinner serving indian food which was really good.
,,Too much hype,1.0,,this is a ridiculously expensive and futile trip if you are travelling with young children. the queues can be horrendous and when out in the open before entry into the park do not have any shelter. seeing young children restlessly queuing up was distressing to say the least. the much touted animal show was cancelled at the snap of a finger [someone's!] in anticipation of rain though not a drop fell. the packed crowd in the auditorium then rushed to join already bulging queues for the tram rides. we skipped the queues and with young children in tow took to the dimly lit paths and saw as little as the poor souls on the trams. all in all a trip to be avoided if you are with young children. you will be far better off taking them to a slap-up meal somewhere.
,,ANIMALS COME ALIVE,5.0,,"Get up close and real personal, you can almost touch them, but, do not. Hears the roar of the lions, hear the elephants and hyenas and see them come alive at night it is simply an unfortgettable experience, all whilst sitting in an open air tram."
,,Good end to the day,4.0,,"We ended our visit to the zoo with the night safari having dinner and a drink before boarding the very busy night train though the zoo.

Quite difficult to get on without booking a time but luckily we had done that in advance so a good idea to consider if you are doing this trip.

Saw plenty of nocturnal animals around especially the elephants and it was nice to see sone we hadn’t during the day only downside now flash photography of course so pictures not if the best quality.

Good entertainment before the train ride out the fire eaters were very good and it helped to make the evening special"
,,Improvement needed,3.0,,It’s was crowded for a really enjoyable night. We could not get to see the show amid full house even with 3 showtimes (a pre-booked session preferred instead of queueing for disappointment). Crowd at the entrance show make it impossible for the kids to view (a “space” reserved for kids to stand in front)
,,Long queue,2.0,,"Very long queue, not worth the wait, nothing much to see anymore, lacks signages, Staff doesn't know where to let you fall in line"
,,“MY Girlfriend Enjoy The Trip”,5.0,,"Last month me and my GF visit Singapore, We visit Night Safari, it’s so much amazing. We definitely visit agin."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We saw several animals throughout the tour, and many were quite close. We were then allowed to walk around the paths after the tour. It was so neat to be in the zoo after dark, almost until midnight, and experience the amazing world of nocturnal animals! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TOUR!"
,,Exceeded our expectations,5.0,,"I did the Night Safari along with my wife, my son and our two young grandchildren. The Indonesian fire eaters were an unexpected treat, whilst waiting in the inevitable queue (this attraction is VERY popular). Despite the numbers of people, it was very well organised. The show in the amphitheatre was very well done - both educational and entertaining. The safari tour 'train' was a delight, with so many nocturnal animals to see, in close to their natural environments. I thoroughly recommend going on at least one of the walks, as well as the train. Being in with the fruit bats was a special treat."
,,An Experience not to be missed,4.0,,"Since Night Safari is the first night “zoo”, it’s quite an experience. The highlight of the whole trip to me is the “Creatures of the Night” show. Best to go when the park opens. More time to explore the park & get to see more animals."
,,An intimate nighttime experience with nature!!,4.0,,"A great experience to see nocturnal creatures in action. The enclosures give a real sense of openness!!
The tram frequency means fast moving queues, but didn’t remain stationary long enough to get long exposure shots of the animals which is a shame.
The Creatures of the Night show was great with a charismatic showman who kept up pace even when the trained animals didn’t."
,,"A good experience, but it needs to be improved",3.0,,"Although park managers have already taken measures of diversion, they still have to wait for a long time.Compared to Chiang Mai night Safari in Thailand，If the park's opening time is 5 p.m., it will be better.There will be more time for walking tour.Children of younger age will be more energetic.Less eyesight visitors can see more animals.It was completely dark. I saw something difficult, which made me feel a little depressed."
,,Night Safari on a stormy night...,5.0,,"We travelled out to he Night Safari by car from our hotel in peak hour traffic, we were about half way there when the skies opened and there was a tremendous storm. Driver suggested we go back to the hotel as all will be cancelled. We continued on and I'm so glad we did.

The fire dancers and first show were cancelled due to the inclement weather but the trams ran like clockwork and the walking trails were open.

The queue for the trams was very long but continually moving so the wait was not unbearable. Once on the tram the adventure began with a slow drive around the park and informative commentary along the way.

Many of the animals which were not on display during our day visit to the zoo were big and bright and active during the evening, it was fantastic. Once our tram journey was over we walked the trails, it was dark, it was raining softly, animals were calling, it was eerie, it was FANTASTIC.

My only suggestion would be to stress to people how much better the experience will be if you keep your voices down. We encountered some very loud people on both the tram and trails which meant we missed sections of the narration and some animals in enclosures as they fled from the noise.

Overall, we had a great night and enjoyed the night safari more than our day at the zoo."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Did the night safari & very enjoyable trip which we’d recommend. The later you go the better the traffic, travelling from Orchard Road. Easy taxi ride. We went to 8.00pm fire show & 9.30pm creatures of the night - good entertainment. Less crowded on tram ride by 10.00pm & saw lots of animals as it was cooler."
,,Fire show,5.0,,"I reckon the fire show at the beginning was the best thing. Safari was OK. More like driving through a zoo. To be fair, I love that they care so much for these animals. Lovely experience. Must try if you are visiting Singapore"
,,Average at best,3.0,,The shows were good and the Safari was good however was let down by the long queue and lack of entertainment in the queue. Felt like it was only really good for young children.
,,Night at the Zoo,5.0,,"We started with the walking path part of the Night Safari and took our time wandering from exhibit to exhibit. We attended the Creatures of the Night Show and highly recommend it! It was part entertainment and part education, but all fun! We stopped for a drink in the bar/restaurant area, then hopped a ""train"" to ride through that part of the safari. It is expensive, but we had a great time."
,,A different experience,3.0,,"If you love animals and have time to visit, then go for it. The cost of approx £50 for 2 people is quite expensive for a couple of hours visit, but it is a unique experience.
The team was a little disappointing as some animals didn’t want to be seen, but please walk the trails after as that is worth it."
,,Zoo,5.0,,"Amazing , excellent , cheap .... the attraction was not to pricey , the que was a bit long as it took 1 hour to get to the front , clean , need more trains to take you round , otherwise would recommend to a friend"
,,Fantastic night!,5.0,,I recently visited the night safari after hearing many good reviews. It lived up to expectations! I had a fantastic time - the team ride was very informative and I also really liked walking around the loops afterwards to see the animals. Very well set up - lighting at the exhibits was just enough to see the animals but not enough to stop them from being active. A lot of reviews complained about the crowds - I just got there early to get on the tram. After that crowds weren’t bad as everyone spreads out on the walking section.
,,Too dark to see everything,4.0,,"I loved to see the animals in the night, but it was too dark to really get a good look at them. But it was nice to see and hear the animals during the night. Sometimes the animals walking around freely scare you :)"
,,Night safari was ok,3.0,,Its a 30- 40 minutes tram ride which takes you through wild night safari where the animals are in open and one can experience the wildlife. Personally I didn’t like it much. Opening Time: 7:15 PM- 12 AM
,,Night Safari Visit,5.0,,"My last visit was 15 years ago and now, it has transformed to a world class Zoo ! I will not require to visit any zoo wherever I travel. Proud to be a Singaporean."
,,Lovely experience overall,4.0,,"We had to wait around between finishing in the main zoo and heading here... the problem with that bring there isn't really anywhere to wait around unless you want to eat or shop which with children in tow was a pain.

Once through the entrance we headed straight for the show. The literature and entrance tickets here are slightly misleading... we had an 815 entrance and were expecting to head straight to the 830 show. As it is we were allowed in around 745 and joined the very end of the queue for the 830 show at that time. So if we had come in at 815 we would have missed it and probably the next one. Anyway, the show was below average and not really worth the queuing anyway so bear that in mind when planning your trip.

The system for queuing for the tram was ok and as it was late the queues were quite short. The tram ride was an enjoyable experience and we got to see all the animals albeit mostly sitting doing nothing rather than roaming as we had hoped.

We took a stroll along the Wallaby trail which was good as it had a little cave near the end of it which was a nice experience for the children.

Glad we went but wouldn't rush back."
,,Would not do again.,2.0,,Too crowded and bad organization for getting on the trams. Very little to see for standing in line for a very long time in the heat.
,,Worth a visit - every time,5.0,,"I have been to this attractions numerous times, yet the recent visit was far from the joy and fun we used to have earlier.

Lot of attractions / animals are not seen (as of yesterday). Some walking trails are closed for renovation. Visitors of first time might not know, if you have visited earlier, you might feel a bit - for the money you pay on the tickets and the travel.

The fire dance - as usual was top notch. The animal show used to have an element of thrill earlier which is missing. It could be even more engaging as it used to be. Nevertheless a good one (for first timers)

The Tram ride used to have two stops in between, which is missing. its one full round in one shot where you cannot get down for a stroll in between.

All in all, worth the money if you are first time visitor. Enjoy the nature's beauty at night."
,,Different in an excellent way!,5.0,,"Different experience to the usual zoos. The Creatures of the Night show is a must. If you can, walk the trails. We skipped due to rain."
,,Good experience,5.0,,The staff was very help ful and friendly!! It was one of the best “have to visit” place in Singapore!
,,Fun time,5.0,,Had a great time at the Night Safari... Specially enjoyed the Creatures of the night show. The tram ride is awesome too.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Went there just because there is a promotion. Not worth going as most animals are asleep. Quite a number of cages are closed due to upgrading. Too many tourists and it felt more like orchard road with animals.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,It's like a learning journey for my kids.I'll bring them there again if there is a promotion. It'll be better if the operation hour can be extended.
,,It was WOW,5.0,,"Take tram ride which last for 45mins. Its different experience. There are also some walking trails, but better to take tram ride."
,,Singapore night safari -,3.0,,"The night safari was a great experience mainly because it’s a “night” which is the adventureous part . The show was pretty average , nothing really out of the ordinary and the actual safari on the tram was ok. There weren’t any animals you can’t find in a zoo at home. The kids enjoyed the experience but they weren’t blown away by it ."
,,Night safari,5.0,,Had a fab time it was great. Recommend going for the 7:15/8:15 to make the most of it. Lots of great animals
,,March 50% Doscount Promotion,3.0,,"The 50% discount promotion should not have time restriction, it should allow admission from 7:15pm. And should not have blackout dates like PH & eve of PH."
,,Amazing experience for kids and adults alike,5.0,,"The highlight of the night safari for us was the tram which takes you on a 40 min ride around the park where you get very good views of the animals. Some of the deer are so close it is as if you are wandering amongst them!

Some of the larger animals like the elephants, lions and rhino look so magnificent. The adults and kids in our group were astounded. Such a wonderful experience!

Well recommended!

Regards
Omar"
,,Very interesting!,5.0,,"It's really cool to see the animals so close to the tram! Some of them are free roaming and they can come so near to the tram. Because it's in the night, the weather is cooling too! The animal show is awesome and funny! Only that the opening hours are too short :("
,,Not value for money.,1.0,,"Show is more of talking than an actual show. Price is too high for the experience we got. It is an ordinary experience which is hype marketed, that will raise the visitors expectations and in turn disappoint the visitor."
,,Night Safari at the Zoo,5.0,,"The night Safari at the Zoo is well worth seeing. Quietly travelling thought the zoo at night in ""tram cars"" looking at the animals is quite an experience. Excellent experience for children."
,,A great experience!,4.0,,A very valuable experience especially for my young daughter. A great family experience! Fun and educational.
,,Unnecessary Tourist Attraction,3.0,,Night safari is good to visit but you can ignore this and spend your time and money in another activity. This type of things available in India in cheap price.
,,Recommended,4.0,,"Night safari needs 2-3 hours to cover. They have an hourly show. Earlier ones are less crowded and I recommend going for the early show. It was nice, but if you dont have time, can skip it. The Main safari is the tram which takes you through the different exhibits. I recommend doing this once night falls... the eerie silence with the ride through the safari road is an excellent experience. There are natural trails that one can walk through as well."
,,One hour queue,2.0,,"Paying good money for a timed visit at 7.30pm with kids is reasonable.
Queuing for one hour for the necessary tram is not reasonable.
Slightly strange selection of animals - so many hyenas?
Overall reaction: was that it?
Feeling: fleeced.
Admittedly great great great to see an elephant and lion.
But seems little attention paid to consumer experience. More attention paid to big cash extraction ( story of our visit to Singapore overall)."
,,A Forgettable Experience!,3.0,,"Was very excited to visit this attraction recently as it is the only night zoo in the world (?), but the experience was unfortunately very forgettable.
To start the ticket pricing is not cheap, we had a 50% voucher which actually was not necessary as to enjoy the discount, you can only visit after 8.00pm. Ironically, all tickets after that time is already at a 50% discounted rate. Thus, although the ticket pricing is inclusive of unlimited tram rides and the shows are free, there was no point as the last show was at 10.30pm.
Am uncertain if it was due to bad luck, but on the night we visited.....all the supposedly nocturnal animals were very highly inactive. All we got to see were deers and more deers, most of the animals were in hiding or just not visible and after awhile it was very straining on the eyes as we have to try and see where the animals may be hiding and if I can be brutally honest.....most looks like rocks.
As for the only show that we caught, I must say that it was relatively exciting as it showed owls and some kind of bear and cats etc.
However, it was already near to closing time after we caught one show, one tram ride and walked the shortest trial (in hope to catch a closer look at the animals).
Perhaps, to truly enjoy this attraction, one must visit during the 7.00pm time slot to fully soak in all the sights, catch all the shows and perhaps at that time the animals will be more lively. However, be prepared to fork out $45 per adult.....which I am not convince at this point is value for money."
,,Wonderful Wonderful,5.0,,It is one those must experience rides in Singapore. It is wonderfully made and orchestrated. Never miss this
,,Educational and Inspirational Trip for Kids and Family On Wildlife,4.0,,"Hi all , This was our first visit to the Night safari though we had visited London Zoo, Done Morning Jungle safari at The Corbett Park, India.

Plan- Night safari starts in the late evening and in our case we took the entry at 9:15 Pm. You can buy tickets at gate/Online/Headway app etc. We found a good price via Headway app.

The place is a little outskirts of Singapore though Taxi and Buses ply and Uber is also there. We preferred Uber and it was safe.

Entry - At the entry there was a Fire Show with athletics and fire in Jungle costumes by 3-4 people and it was open for all while half the crowd was sitting and half standing to get the closer view.

It’s important to keep your self Hyderabad and there are taps using which you can fill your bottles or buy packed bottles.

Post this show we went to the Animal show . It was an open air theater with sitting at the multi level stairs and front for the Anchor and Animals to perform. The show lasted for about 30 mind including Pictures with the Panther/Owl etc.

During the show we were spell bound by the performance of Animals which performed to the instructions of the trainers. It was fun for kids and during the show they take volunteers from crowd and give goodies for their support.

Third and longest was the real Night safari in which about 16 people go together in a guided tram. During the safari we saw so many animals like Lion, elephant,deer, hippopotamus, Bear, Wild cow. There is a recorded guidance and information about wild life, animals, their preservation and what’s being done to maintain the eco system, How our visit makes the difference. It’s really inspirational and educational to know and be aware. Kids had a great time. Post that one can buy goodies/Souvenirs.

Then it’s the time to say goodbye, we exited the zoo arround 12 am. Overall a very good experience for the family. Recommend it!"
,,Waste of an evening,1.0,,"If you like uplit mouse deer, porcupines and unidentifiable shuffling mounds then this is the tour for you!

The main problem with a night safari is it's rather difficult to spot animals in the dark. Love the concept and would like to try again with night vision binoculars, but as is, it didn't work for me.

Only cool thing was the different types of hyenas which were well lit and active. Everything else would have been better in the day.

Crazy long queue for an English tram midweek and overall the experience just felt like a waste of an evening. Singapore has so many cool things to do, unfortunately, even for animal lovers, night safari is not one of them. Sorry."
,,crowded!,2.0,,Nice park but far too many people which does NOT make for a nice experience! Especially for the tram! The queue took 50 minutes!
,,Sleeping animals...,1.0,,"Well... where should I start?... The bus trip to the Night Safari through the evening rush hour was great, we had great weather and could enjoy the evening sun on one of the topless buses.
As we arrived at the Night Safari (7pm) we experienced around 2,4 million tourist (exaggerated) who have tried to build a queue.
55 min later our trip started with one of the so called ""trams"" through the whole zoo.
What should I say? Night ... dark .... sleeping animals .... holy sh*...

Well all in all I can highly recommend this tour to all people who like to drive around the city for an hour, stand in line for another hour and then barely see any animals due to missing lights in the park. If you are lucky enough to spot any kind of deer or other deers, they will sleep... cause it's night.
After the great tour (appr. 40min with tram through the zoo) you can wait another 50 min for the returning bus + another hour to the city central.

Great experience, sorry for 1 out of 5 stars, it's impossible to click 0."
,,Don't do it - its horrible,1.0,,The Night Safari is totally overrated. It is too expensive and you barely see any animals. The enclosures for the animals are really small and there are always a lot of people. Not comparable to the big zoos we are used in Europe.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Only went as my travel companion wanted to go. Took the ""tram"". Its was more like those train carts. Only few elephants, lots of different deers and hogs, tiger behind a glassed area, 2 lions, hyenas. It was kinda boring to be honest as the animals you want to see are off in the distance, barely visible. You can walk around the zoo too. Save your money and do something else"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We spent a lot of money on a buffet dinner and a night safari. There was no need to book the buffet dinner as it was open to all with hundreds of seats anyway. It was hard to find anything to my taste to eat.
The night safari [I expected to see nocturnal animals] was a ride through a lot of animals that are awake in the day but more difficult to see in the dark. Nothing special."
,,"If you only have time for one touristy trap, make it this one",5.0,,"We are only in town for 2 days, so down to just one tourist trap we really could afford to spend time on, and we chose this. Even though this was the third visit, we still thoroughly enjoyed it. Whoever dreamt of this night safari idea should be given some lifetime honour. And the show is run very well, many different types of animals nicely laid out. A must for any visitor to Singapore."
,,Better than 'Springwatch'!,5.0,,"An unforgettable experience. My wife and I booked the tour through an agency and included an evening meal at the Ulu Ulu restaurant. The meal was a buffet with a mixture of Tamil, Malay and Chinese cuisine. Plenty of it and it was very tasty. Drinks were extra but served very promptly. The staff were very attentive and obliging. After the meal there was a chance to watch the fire eating display and browse some of the souvenir stalls before boarding the tram for the safari. The queue was very well controlled and boarding the tram was completed with the usual Singaporean efficiency. In next to no time we were off spotting the various species on our way around. The Safari is very well sited and laid out with plenty to interest all ages. The lighting was better than I expected so nothing was missed.

A superb evening out and well worth the money. I can whole heartedly recommend this attraction. Additionally, the money collected does go to wildlife conservation, which is explained with the commentary. Walking back after the tram had dropped us off was all a pretty magical experience. Watching the otters playing in the waterfall in the 'moonlight' was a sight not to be missed. We would definately do it again."
,,Simply the best way to see animals and in a cool night setting,5.0,,Well worth the cost of entry - go early and stay for the walking trails. The later you stay the better - open until midnight. Be careful on taxis home as they become a bit scarce after 11pm.
,,Unique experience!,4.0,,We went on the Night Safari after a full day at the Zoo and then River Cruise. Good dinner options before the Safari. Very popular and crowded with queues. Tram provided good views of animals at close range and was not rushed. Unique experience!
,,One of its kind,5.0,,This is one place where animals are in open and we move around in a tram ..out of the main city .public transport is available..2 shows(each twice at different timings) are free with the night safari entry.. We booked through Klook app so got discounts. Try to reach at 7 pm so a 45 minute tram ride . One show of half hour and another of 20 minutes can all be done. Staff is very helpful ..slots of tram start at 7.15 pm. Sightings of animals is generally successful..Also they have a walking trail instead of teams but i guess 95% people use trams...suitable for elderly..
,,Great Night Safari trip with 4 children and an elderly,5.0,,"I went to Singapore Night Safari with my 4 children and mother who needs a wheelchair.. I have read that there will be a long queue and prepared all the necessary things needed to keep my children busy while waiting at the queue. Surprisingly, it was not bad at all. There was a long queue but it disappeared fast! Also with my mother on a wheelchair, we got into the priority queue which basically is not a queue at all. The staff were very helpful and approached us to move to the priority queue. Great initiative. They didn't wait for us but came to let us through fast. I was so glad and all my worries of a long wait was gone. We had a fun night and would definitely visit it again. Great friendly staff, good facilities, well worth my money going there."
,,Improved! Much better experience,4.0,,"Went to the night safari years ago and left disappointed as I could not see most of the animals. This time round, we saw all the animals except one. The tram was excellent for families with young children whom might not be able to walk far. It was a good introduction to the place and allowed us to have the energy to take short walks around after. Food was expensive as expected. Overall, a much more positive experience!"
,,Must do,5.0,,"we entered the place and went straight for the creatures of the night show. It was fun we many animals and tricks. then made it fast to the trams, the line can be long and the wait may be tiring but it is worth it..!! the ride is about 20-30mins long, u get to see all the wild animals in the natural habitat, its pretty dark to replicate a jungle loom so they dont encourage flash photography or any noise. u can do the walking trails if you want to get close to the animals, but don't worry they are all fenced. Lots of restaurants at the exit so you can grab dinner and head back. We took the metro to Khatib and then the Mandai Khatib Shuttle to the safari. It was easy and cheap, but bear in mind that you need a metro card for the shuttle bus as they dont accept cash payment. We took the SAEX transfer back which we booked once out of the safari. it took abt 40mins back to the city but it stopped at our hotel so no hassle. They are plenty of taxis etc.. too so transport is not problem.. Overall we loved the night safari!!"
,,Best Zoo experience :),5.0,,It starts with a great show and then you can jump on the tram and see all the animals in the enclosures. The show is fantastic and educational. The Animals appear well cared for and the enclosures are well maintained. The restaurants on site are okay too. I personally found this experience better than the Zoo in the day.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"This is a unique attraction experience. Well worth the effort to get there. We got a 10% discount because we flew with Singapore Airlines which was a bonus. The tram ride does not cover the whole park but they light the enclosures and you can see the animals feeding. There are also walking tracks but it is harder to see the animals as their enclosures are not lit. We couldn’t see the shows due to bad weather. The queues are amazing with the 7:15 and 8:15 slots the most popular. If you get there early go over the the zoo because people start queuing over and hour before the show.

They are very efficient at managing the queues and they move along at a consistent pace"
,,Go early and enjoy everything you can,5.0,,"This was my second time on Night Safari.

I tried both Saex and taxi to get there.

Saex is cheap option but sometimes it delayed, especially when you get back to the city. Taxi is highly recomended if there are.

If you reserve your ticket via online then you just need to show your ticket on your phone to the staff. It’d be better to reserve ticket on 19:15.

You should come earlier than entry time then you can watch fire show at entrance while standing on the line. (Which starts at 19:00)

And go straight for the Creature of the night show starts at 19:30. There are still sunlight at that time. After that you can ride a tram or walk along the trails.

You will see some animals go through beside a tram. I still wonder how they can. I didn’t see any fence around those animal. Tiger or lion is rare to see if you don’t get right timing. There is no chance to take a picture because light around is not enough and tram runs quite fast. It also takes time to find animal under the shadow. Just see and remember with your own eyes.
They service other language options on tram. You just need birng your earphone with wire (not bluetooth).
There is a photo time before tram starts. Sit on the left if you want to get a photo.

If you walk along the trail, you can see the animals from other view with more time.
Still, lion and tiger is hard to see.
But animals like reptiles, cloud leopard you can only see on the walking trail. But it is still hard to find those animal. Just like hide and seek.
There are restroom and drink seller on the middle of the trails.

This place is well made. It is a good chance for both kid and adult to have a new experience for Zoo at night."
,,"Night Safari , an awesome experience",5.0,,"It was an awesome experience for me and my family after we returned from the flyer. I had done jungle safari at day , but at night , it was a new experience and adventure for me when we were in an open rail car and in front of open lions and other wild animals and surprisingly they did nothing to us ....

Very decent experience !!!"
,,A really cool experience with lots of ooohs and aaaahs!,4.0,,"I would choose the 8.15pm ride if you can. The earlier one can still have some light and the later ones (9.15 & 10.15) don't really allow you to do much else apart from the tram ride, as you can't do the walks before the tram and the show is then too late if you have kids.
However the experience is great. We did the River Safari (don't be fooled, just because it has ""river"" in the title this does not mean it is in a boat). The River Safari walks you around a river themed zoo, which is actually quite intestine and we'll displayed. My favourite bits were the crocs and the giant pandas!! There are plenty of places to eat and sit. We had a two hour wait, and it wasn't even that bad. There is a fire dancing show just outside the Night Safari entrance which is obviously designed to keep waiting customers happy and entertained. It does the job. Once throigh thr Night Safari entrance there is plenty of cueing ti get on the trams. However my highlight was the Asian Tiger and the elephants. The souvenirs are expensive and the food is over priced but not unusual for a place like this. Just amazing how visitors are able to be so close to the animals without any visable walls (except for the tiger...).
This was a great day out. We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Tomorrow we will do something less expensive! Ha ha!!"
,,Great fun and saw nearly every animal,5.0,,"There was always a chance with it being night that we wouldn’t get to see many of the animals in the exhibit, but we were lucky and saw nearly every single animal there was to see! As you would expect, it is a bit tourist attraction and so was incredibly busy but there are ways to manage this. Booking online in advance is important first, not just because of the small discount to price but to make sure you get the earliest slot at 7.15pm as they do sell out. The other option is to try and go on a weekday instead of a weekend if possible. We arrived on the day at around 5.45/6pm and had dinner there; the buffet looked incredibly busy, but the range of normal stalls offered a great range and we had a really tasty kung pao chicken where one portion was enough to share between two. By the time we’d finished, we went towards to entrance around 6.50 by which time queues had already formed to get into the park. They started letting people in around 7pm, which meant that we missed the fire show but it was worth it to get in earlier and see the first animal show inside. Do this first as the stewards suggest when you enter, but ignore them when they try and funnel you onto the trams when you come out of the show. Everyone else will go this way, leaving the walking trails nearly empty for you to explore. That way, by the time you complete the walking trails in comparative peace, there will be absolutely no queue for the tram to finish the evening. We saw everything there was and we were finished by around 10/10.30 before we caught an uber back to our hotel, about a half hour drive back into the city."
,,Great experience but...,4.0,,"First of all the night safari is a must see / do attraction if you are in Singapore. We entered the park at 7:15pm - the doors opens at 6:45 pm - so we joined first the show, which was great. After that we went to the park tram and been super disappointed. Not about what we have seen on the tram - no, the waiting time for the tram was nearly one hour. The Organisation of embracing was far of a good efficient organization. But all the rest was worth the money. My advise go first by foot the hole trail and do the tram - the ride takes approximately 45Min at the end. Because when we left there was the waiting time 5Min."
,,Really cool,5.0,,Very cool and worth doing. Bring mosquito repellant. My son loved it and your kids will too. Very cool to see hyenas and stuff. Thought the bus tour was a little too quick. The lines were really long so I suggest not going on a weekend or holiday. Singapore does attractions right so there are good restaurants and stuff inside too.
,,Lovely experience,1.0,,"The place is good and caters a lot of travellers daily, therefore many people will come across long queues and have to stand for a long time, though it is diffcult with kids as we saw the people who were bearing this pain.
Lack of staff/employees members who could guide the tourists. After long queues, when one enters and gets a chance to sit then the experience begins...which has been a worth spending time in the queues... Overall a nice experience."
,,My favourite,5.0,,Night safari is much more popular than our first visit. You can walk from the zoo to the night safari 3 mins. Zoo closes at 6 pm night safari opens 7.15pm. Plenty of places to eats while you wait. If you walk around when you get there and then go on the train you will miss the crowds. Also try to walk around without others so you can walk quietly as others tend to make a lot of noise and the animals don’t come out saw more animals by waiting quietly for them.
,,Wonder Night,5.0,,"have you ever visited a zoo at night? Welcome to the one & only unique experience in the world performed post dawn. A great setup to experience enthralling animals under dark, learn their behaviors, happens with a guided tour for half and hour. Before the start, we were treated to majestic dance performance where performers performed with flame."
,,Waste of money and time!,2.0,,"It is a very small enclosure with limited species of animals who are sleeping/resting usually in the evening hours. You would be lucky to spot them with naked eyes in the dark. (mostly deers and a few more such as bison, black bear, asiatic lion, bengal tiger, girraffes, elephants, Rhino, Hippo and Otters). After the tram ride, there is an animal show called 'creatures of the night' in which they tell you some interesting facts about white racoon, otters, fishing cat, owls, hyena and snakes, which I am sure an animal lover can read for free on internet.
Final verdict - not worth your money and time."
,,Superb must visit attraction,5.0,,One of the must visit attraction in sinagporr night Safari. Kid friendly ..shows are very good..also it's an amazing experience to see animals in the dark.. We had to wait for an hour to get into tram..very crowded on friday night..
,,Dissapointed night safari,1.0,,I visited night safari in sg on 29th March that was good friday eve at 9pm n less crowded as what the tour recommend at this time to come n one of the recommendation by tour agent a must to visit. If u have been to night safari in others country or just say thailand is nothing comparable. Sg night safari is zoo with most of the animals in enclosure n not much animals to see n the the animal night creatures show the worst of all even our night safari in malaysia is better than this. Not worth to spend this money n entrances fee is pricy here spend your money else where. The good things about the sg night safari is the beauty n cleaniness of this place n staff r polite.
,,An underwhelming experience!,3.0,,"The tram ride was disappointing. There was not a lot of animal activity. Was this due to the fact that there was a convoy of vehicles and they were very loud? The commentary was perfunctory and of poor sound quality. Visibility is difficult from the central seats.
The walking trails were a much better experience, very atmospheric at night and more exciting in terms of animal observation. But allow plenty of time to explore leisurely - we were rushed in order to make a coach departure deadline."
,,Solo at the night zoo,3.0,,"This was ok, but would have been far more enjoyable if I went with others. The night zoo puts on some entertaining shows. Definitely a must see! Most of the animals were hidden behind vegetation or it was too dark to see them. I got bored and left early. The zoo grounds are very nicely designed and travelling on the shuttles around the zoo was good. I can see the appeal of visiting at night as it’s not as hot."
,,An awesome evening,5.0,,The highlight of the Singapore Zoo is the night safari. The ride through the tropical rainforest watching the nocturnal animals was a treat to the eyes. Missed the animal show as I had to wait more than an hour as it was full 😰
,,Great to combine with an afternoon trip to River Safari,5.0,,"We took the 7:15 pm ticket- headed to The Creatures of the Night show & took the tram tour as our 7-year old kid was no longer in the mood to do the trails. By the time we finished the tram tour & decided to do the walking trail, she was asleep and my husband had to carry her. It was not the ideal choice but it's one of the things you deal with when traveling with kids.

Ideally, the best thing to do is to get inside at 7:15pm, The Creatures of the Night show, do the walking trail and then do the tram tour. By the time you're done, you should able to watch the fire dance by the entrance.

Despite not being able to do the walking trail properly, we really loved it and we plan to go back in 2-3 years when our kid has more energy to do night/walking activities. The experience of getting close to the animals was splendid!"
,,Great unique experience,5.0,,"Once in Singapore, you shouldn't miss a trail path during the night time at zoo, and the bats cave aswell.

Spend here like 2-3 hours, alomg with nocturnals animals, unique feelings.

Highly recommended, althrough a little bit pricey (45 SGD each). Take UBER or GRAB to or from the Zoo location took half an hour.

Enjoy!"
,,Amazing experience.,5.0,,"No words are enough to sumrise the wonderful experience. One should have this place in their itenary when you are visiting Singapore.
Please make sure you do not fall prey to Isango/iventure flexi_pass it was not honoured at their designated counters on 11/03/2018.as they were not in business from November 2017"
,,An Experience Worth Considering!,4.0,,"One of its kind experience of witnessing nocturnal animals live, this safari is totally worth it. Though it was raining when we went and missed out on a few animals and it had turned really dark, but still it was a unique experience. The animal show after the safari is also totally worth it. Must visit when in Singapore"
,,Night safari,5.0,,"This is definitely a recommended trip. Purchase your tickets at the Duck and Hippo tourist centre at Suntec city. That way you can use your hop on and off bus ticket and get a 10 percent discount. Plus it saves a queue at the zoo. For the night Safari take the early bus, 1800. It's 40 mins to the zoo. This allows you to take the 1915 safari. Any later and you won't have time to wander around the zoo after the safari. The enclosures are Great, no cages. Some are open, such as the wallaby enclosure, allowing you to get close to the animals. Well worth a visit, but don't miss the last bus back!"
,,Leave plenty of time (in case you need to be anywhere later),3.0,,"Unfortunately the trams were faulty the night we went. In broke down and caused a traffic jam. Our 30-40 minute tour turned into a 75 minute dawdle, with sitting around for 10-15 minutes three times while they tried to get the faulty tram started or under tow. So while the sights on the tour were fantastic when we were moving, we didn't get to see the show or a chance to walk around the trails."
,,great experience,5.0,,"did it at as a tour that picked up from our hotel, 2nd time i have been (10 years apart) still as good if not better. did the tram round and a the night show. plenty of places to eat. really really busy."
,,Excellent Experience,5.0,,"I was at the Night Safari for about 3 hours, starting with the 7:15 PM entrance (the first one). If one arrives there earlier, there are a number of restaurants to eat dinner beforehand. There is initially a long line for the tram tour, so to save time one could watch The Creatures of the Night show or walk some of the trails first. Once the initial crowd is finished with the tram, the line is substantially shorter. I was able to do all the trails, the tram tour and catch the show and finish around 10 PM. Note to plan transportation ahead of time as getting to and from the zoo is not the clearest or easiest."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"It was my first time visiting a zoo at night and it was a very amazing experience indeed. The night show was really impressive ---- animals were introduced to us in a very cool and fun way. You can then take a tram ride or / and walk up the different trails to see the animals. Personally I would recommend taking the tram ride --- while it only passed through the major spots in the zoo --- it was a wonderful experience to be able to see the animals at night to get a better picture of what life was like for them. Walking up the trails on foot would depend greatly on luck --- some of the animals might be hiding or sleeping so you might not get to see many of them really.

One note though --- for those who would like to take photos and selfies instead of simply appreciating the animals, you might be disappointed because it's so dark it's impossible to take any photos. So this is really a place for those who truly just wants to appreciate the nature, and enjoys a bit of adventure."
,,Unexpectedly hilarious,3.0,,"The queue to get on was phenomenal.

The lilting Americanized voice annoying and often inaccurate telling you to look right instead of left.

The animals were either comatose or hiding which made the commentary very funny.

The explanation of why otter poo smells nearly had me choking.

As per usual few people can follow instructions regardless of how often they are repeated, so it was noisy and we stopped several times due to people using flash.

It was funny but I doubt I would recommend it."
,,Cool experience and different animals to see,4.0,,"This was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Singapore. It feels very Halloween-like to be walking around a zoo-like space in the dark. However, you do get to see some interesting animals. I recommend going a bit later so you get the animals after they have woken up more. There is a tram that goes around and then 4 areas you can walk around. I recommend doing the walking first, then end with the tram. It took us about 1 hr to do the walking part. The tram took forever because we stopped 2 times for 10-15 min the first time and then 20-25 minutes the second time. The first time we were told about a stalled out tram in front but the second time there was no word, which was irritating. However the tram was cool and a good way to end your time there. The fire show was cancelled due to weather and we didn't see the other one. Don't plan to take a lot of pictures because no flash is allowed and the lighting is dim, so put the camera away and just enjoy!"
,,AVOID !!!!,2.0,,"The good thing about this place is that SINGAPORE ZOO, NIGHT SAFARI are both side by side and 5 mins walking distance.

All Animals you see in dark and not in personal but on the safari long jeep, it not like regular safari where you go in jungle, it is a normal night zoo where they will take you to view the animals which are caged.

Simply avoid if you want to save your money, rather go for singapore zoo and Jurong bird park where you can see all animals in broad day light and not in dark.

Simply avoid if you can, a BIG NO."
,,Excellent adventure for all ages,5.0,,"The Night Safari is a great experience, for children and adults. A bit far from the city and can be difficult to find a taxi willing to take you there. But no problem getting a taxi back, lots available. The train ride through the enclosures was excellent, and everything is beautifully lit in a kind of artificial moonlight. Well worth a visit."
,,Horrible queues,2.0,,"Make no mistake, this is a zoo! Even though visitors are on a tram, not that enclosed, and obviously a lion can't get near us. The animals weren't native which I think a safari should be. It was good and lots of animals to see but the queues to get in were awful!! We arrived 7.15 but that time was 'sold out' so we had to wait 50 mins to line up again and then it was another hour before boarding the tram. There were many small children struggling to stay awake. People behind us were beckoned to join the priority line so boarded before us. Then after the tram ride, it was 9.30 when a show was about to start - it was sold out of course."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"This is a magic way of seeing a zoo,by night and the surroundings are very good,the ;lines can be a little long but with a tour group this was overcome."
,,Only for Kids,3.0,,"Very less number of animals and recommended only for kids. Couples can avoid and save energy, money and time."
,,Not My Thing But Well Done,3.0,,I personally am not a fan of zoos or the like so this was not my idea of fun however I will say it is extremely well done for what it is. The venue is spotless and pretty - lots of gift shops and food options. The commentary is interesting and educational.
,,Can't barely see,3.0,,"For travelers like me who have poor eyesight won't really appreciate the night safari. If I knew, I would have opt for the day trip."
,,Night Safari Trip,4.0,,"It was a fun trip with friends, the tram ride is good for the elderly and children who wouldn't want to walk that much around the park."
,,Animals were sleeping and so many exhibit under repair,1.0,,"This is the most disappointing trip i have ever went on, animals were sleeping (tigers can’t even be seen out) and there were so many exhibits under maintenance that the whole trip seems redundant, wasted 150 bucks for my family of five cause there weren’t anything much to see other than the show and the tram ride."
,,Night safari,3.0,,"I did the night safari because everyone said it was great. The tram ride is just animals you would see in a day zoo, but in the dark, as you pass them at 5mph. Am not sure what the attraction is. After the tram ride I went on the longer of the two walks, which was not bad. The highlight was going into the bat enclosure."
,,Really entertaining,5.0,,There is a tram ride showing different loose animals and provides a little but of insight. You can also do the different walking trails on your own. There is also an interesting performance show with different animals. It is definetely a unique experience.
,,Splendid Attraction w World Class Experience,5.0,,"It was a great experience. There were shows at the entrance, food choices, and most importantly, animals were active and could be easily seen. Would bring my family there again!"
,,Nocturnal safari is cool,4.0,,"This is not an African safari but still worthwhile. We booked a private tram and tour guide. This is highly recommended. But whether you go in the larger tram with the pre recorded information or on a private tour with Guide Extraordinaire Zelda, you will see the same animals. You are very close to the animals yet far enough away that you need not be scared. You get to see animals that you wouldn’t ordinarily see at a day time zoo and have the chance of seeing them active. The negative is that this place is a huge tourist attraction and the hordes of people can be overwhelming. Most of the gimmicky parts would work well for little ones. For adults not interested in the trickery, do go on your chosen tour and then escape!!"
,,Interesting but more touristy than educational,3.0,,"We had heard a tremendous amount about the night safari and were eagerly looking forward to it. At the end, I was left a little disappointed. Basically it is a team ride through various enclosures. It is a long tram full of people and the guide speaking through a microphone giving you small pieces of trivia as you zip through the pre designated path. The animals are fantastic particularly the white lions, bull elephant, and hippos. However, this felt very much like an ""entertainment ride"" and it would be much better if the groups were smaller and there was a little more time spent at each enclosure with more discussions (and even questions/answers) regarding animal behavior/conservation etc. However, it is quite apparent that the zoo intends this to be a high throughput, high volume touristy experience which is not really what I feel a ""safari"" is really meant to be - as I think there should be an educational aspect to it as well."
,,Limited view because of the dark,3.0,,"It is dark so u can't see as much. The train shuttle guide was cool. Kids would love this. Food very expensive. Can get cheaper tickets online. I would not go again with adults only, but would with my kids."
,,Night zoo,5.0,,"Night zoo who would have thought !! Jump on a tram, then wonder along four different zoned paths to see all the nocturnal animals awake and active and some free range as well. wow a great way to spend an evening"
,,Different way to see the animals,4.0,,Worth a visit if you want to see some of the nocturnal animals. Was able to see quite a few animals both on the train and walking around. Taking photos is not possible due to it being very dark. But to experience the animals up and close is amazing. The lion was roaring for a while - which sounded eerie and amazing at the same time.
,,Night tour,3.0,,We had heard great things about this - we to be honest didn’t think it was that great or worth the money - I think it would be a lot better to check the zoo out during the day so you could do it at your own pace. We were however able to see most of the animals and our guide did provide a lot of facts on the trip around. Lots of restaurants and gift shops at the zoo. We went and thankfully the lines to get people on the trams did move quickly. We get it was expensive for the short time we spent there.
,,Visited Zoo,5.0,,"The place is cozy for family or single traveler. Inside the museum has 3 building Singapore Zoo, Singapore Night Zoo and River Safari. Am visiting river safari for meet with giant panda"
,,Average one,3.0,,To be very honest I was not much impressed with the Night Safari concept. As per traveller post their review yes it was very dark and most of the time you will not be able to identifying the animal. In dark you can't take picks except you your camera have night vision. You can not use flash lights as it distract to animals. For taking the tram ride you need to face very long line. If you are travelling with infant be careful in dark they can feel scary.
,,Night at the Zoo,4.0,,"I had previously visited this great venue when I lived here 3 years ago. However this time I took my husband who had always wanted to go. We booked an excursion through our hotel which took us there and back and avoided the long queues. This is a good idea as you are fast tracked for everything and it takes the pressure off. We arrived at about 7.15pm and went straight onto the tram tour, this takes approximately 40 mins. This is a great way to experience the night safari and you get to see lions being fed and all the large Mammals such as elephants and giraffes. We then took the walking trail to see smaller animals which takes about 40 mins and is really interesting as well. We didn’t make it to the animal show as the queue was too long. We left at 10pm, my advice would be to get their earlier, do the walking trail and tram and then finish with the show. Also eat before you get there as it’s quite expensive for family’s. I would definitely recommend this experience to everyone as it’s so different, just make sure you pick a dry night!"
,,Fantastic way to see animals you don't normally get to see,5.0,,"I was so impressed by the night safari and highly recommend this to do on your trip to Singapore.

Upon arrival I was recommended to take the walking tracks first, see the show and then the tram and it worked out great.

The walking trails are easy to follow and I found it super exciting to explore the trails and walk around in very low light as it gives a completely new and different experience to previous zoo trips.

It was so cool to see the animals out and about and active, which you don't always get to see in the day. Some of the most exciting things for me to see was the bigger-than-expected hyenas, the tiger, the lion and the otters.

Also a highlight was the Creatures by night show where we got to see many animals up close including a huge monkey and a snake.

After walking around and seeing the show, i took a tram around the zoo which gave a very informative commentary and an additional close up including seeing one of the most beautful elephants I have ever seen.

I'll be going back on my next trip for sure!

I took the train and then a bus to get out to the zoo. In hindsight I should have booked a transfer. I took a taxi home which cost around $20."
,,Great for animal lovers,5.0,,"long lines and lots of kids, book a tour to skip the lines. You see a lot of animals. Wear comfy clothes - there is food to eat but nothing fantastic."
,,Night Tour with TMG tours,3.0,,"My husband and I did a Singapore Zoo night tour with TMG tours. First impression of the Zoo was how loud it all was. TMG tours was well conducted and most importantly got us to the front of the line as priority guests when boarding the road train carriages. Tour lasted about half an hour and you got to see most of the animals , some you could almost touch. Afterwards you could walk around the zoo briefly or grab some dinner. We opted for dinner as tour started at 6 and finished at 10.30. Large choice of styles of food including fast food. Prices higher than elsewhere but that seems to be normal for zoos. It was worthwhile booking the tour as I was really glad I wasn’t waiting in the long lines to board the train. It’s just too hot. There is also a day Zoo and animals completely different to the night zoo so if time permits do a day trip as well. Pack some water or buy it from your bus driver for a dollar. There is a bottle filling Station near the bathrooms. Sorry no photos as I didn’t want my flash to go off automatically which was forbidden during the tour."
,,Very dark,3.0,,"Yes, I know it’s a night safari and therefore, it is dark. But do know that there’s really minimal lights along the tram route so as not to disturb the animals so much so in some places, you can barely see the animals."
,,"Not worth the stress, crowds and looooooooooong lineups",2.0,,"Everyone raves about the night safari being a must do in Singapore.
Verdict.. waste of time and money.
1. Very expensive for what it is.
2. Expect loooong lineups for everything. >45 minutes for tram and have up and walked.
3. Can really see much as the whole thing is designed for tram viewing.
4. Bring the insect repellent
5. Better off spending your time and money exploring something else a zoo is a zoo is a zoo"
,,The WORST experience ever.,1.0,,"I should be refunded.
DON’T pay for it, specially if it says your operator is RMG!

REMEMBER THIS NAME: RMG!
They will make your day to be unforgettable.

The zoo is poor of animals. The last one, a tiger, was hidden by a trolley they parked in front of him

They (RMG) let me there standing, the leader was missing, he was not clear, had a very bad English speaking, not clear at all to the meeting point.

I had to get a cab to get back to my hotel. Totally unacepotavle for a tourist that paid the price they asked for!

THE WORS EXPERIENCE EVER.
Don’t get into!!!!"
,,very good!,4.0,,very good night activity to do in Singapore. I went there with a group to avoid the long queues! It's good. Some strange animals I saw! Recommended for who likes animals
,,Excellent opportunity to see Zoo based animals in realistic jungle environment,4.0,,The tour was very well organised. The animals were seen in a natural habitat setting and not the usual artificial zoo environment. Worth every penny!!
,,Not worth trip,2.0,,"It is not a safari per se. Animals are fed so they stay in place for tourist photo shops. This is a zoo experience, not a safari experience."
,,Memorable For The Family,5.0,,"I took the tram with three young children (9, 10, and 12) and they loved the journey. At some points, passengers get to be up close to the animals and the children got really excited! However, because we took a while to get on board, we missed the last Creatures of the Night show, which was a pity. The children were not willing to walk the trails (they felt it was too dark or would be too tiring) but that was more our issue than anything else."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Whether you have a limited time in Singapore or not, Night Safari at Singapore Zoo gives you a chance to see animals with the weather is better and the animals are active. You can sit on the tram and hear an guided tour that is informative and tells about their conservation efforts and bringing awareness. There are times it feels like there is no barrier between you and the animals, so it gives you a feeling of closeness."
,,Too dark to see much,1.0,,"This was very disappointing. We went to the main zoo during the day, and decided to have a dinner there before going to the Night Safari. We did the self-guided walk through the zoo, and saw very little. We weren’t allowed to walk along the road, as this was reserved for visitors who wanted to pay even more $$ and wait in a long queue to sit on a crowded tram."
,,A unique experience for an evening outing,5.0,,"We went to the Night Safari and because the shuttle from Khatib MRT station doesn't run after 7.20 we took a hotel pickup from SAEX for S$12 per person return but if you go there by public transport you can also buy a ticket for the return journey to your hotel (or another hotel nearby) at the zoo where the buses stop. We stayed about 3 hours having arrived for our 7.15 entrance. You can also book entrance for 8.15 and 9.15. On entrance there were huge queues for the tram ride which run continuously until 11pm but we were ushered into the Creatures of the Night show first (a must see) and when we came out the queues for the tram had gone and we walked straight on. We had no problem seeing the lions and most of the other animals. We took the tram a second time just before the 9.15 entrance time, sitting the other side of the car this time. There are walking trails too, like the Fishing Cat's trail but sadly they weren't fishing at the time we went by...."
,,Best visitor attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"This is by far and away the best visitor attraction in Singapore and offers a real thrill as you sit on the train steadily seeing animals in their natural habitat. You can walk around but it takes ages and you're likely to get lost doing so.

The train is wonderful and will take you around the zoo in about an hour.

there are also great eateries and plenty of tourist shops."
,,The tiger roar,5.0,,"Just do this. Get on the tram first and go through and then walk the two trails to ser the rest. In my trip the lions growled back and forth at eat other and the the tiger began to roar. This is the coolest sound. You're walking through a jungle trail and you're listening to a tiger roar. Better than any movie sound affect. Go into the bat cave, little scary, but exciting. These bats are huge and just right there and awake because it's night. The elephants rolled and played in the mud, the leopards laid by the glass and slept and I sat next to them. This was the best zoo / safari I have ever been to. No pictures because there is no flash allowed and the park it lit by moonlight lighting. Just go."
,,Started from afternoon and poped to Night Safari,4.0,,"I took Uber to get there and after night safari also. I dont remember the price from the city but i think it was not that expensive.

I had a dinner at the Zoo but if you pop to Night Safari, there are restuants there too."
,,Amazing experience!!,5.0,,"A must do, supporting animals while enjoying a fun night is a great plan for any day. Highly recommended!"
,,Consider only if you have more time,4.0,,"We arranged this prior to arrival which is a must. You can pay additional money to guarantee a time slot for the tram. We went with this option since traveling with a young one. Expect long queues and loads of tour buses to frequent even on weekdays.
Some animals were definitely more alert and looking around as the tram drove by. However the tram didn’t just stop for a long period of time so often felt as a quick glimpse.
We only did the tram option rather than doing a walking trail.
I was satisfied with just the tram as we had time constraints and already had visited the zoo during the day."
,,A little disappointing,2.0,,"We were all looking forward to the Night Safari but ended up being disappointed.

My 21 year old son wasn’t convinced the animals were real at first, but what concerned me was the fact that the animals were all there to be seen under the dimmed floodlight at the front of each enclosure.

Personally, I didn’t think this was natural behaviour for animals whether they were nocturnal or not as surely they would shy away from the light?

I came to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that the enclosures must be very small and the animals had nowhere else to go but right at the front of the enclosure under the lights for the passing trams to see.

It felt wrong, somehow."
,,Great trip & can't wait to go again,5.0,,Great trip to the night safari - really good to wander along well thought out trails to see amazing animals. Staff were all very friendly.
,,Not worth the $. Go only if you get some free tickets,2.0,,"Been there a number if times and didn’t really find worth the money spent on the ticket. Most of the animals will be sleeping or inactive. Much better to opt for the zoo during the day and you’ll be able to catch most of the animals in their active mode. And zoo is cheaper. Btw, night safari IS the zoo, just that the visiting hours are at night!"
,,Try the night zoo,3.0,,"This is the last stop for the bus line so with the subway it was an easy reach. There are scheduled shows at the ampitheater which is fun, but rather short. The next activity is to ride the tram its length to see a good variety of animals in fairly natural settings. They can be hard to spot and the tram cannot hesitate too much. The third piece of the adventure is to walk paths through other habitats.
The zoo is rich with variety and nicely done and although we agree with the principles presented it does become rather preachy at times.
We found the meals a little expensive and not particularly appealing."
,,Interesting Concept but Fails to Deliver,3.0,,"We arrived around 700pm and were greeted by massive lineups for this attraction.

Basically you are driven around a course in a wheeled train sitting at least 4 abreast. Animals are pointed out along the way, but generally you can only see the ones on your side of the tram.

Not much to see compared with a real zoo and of course overpriced."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We went on a Thursday evening, brought our tickets through govoyagin.com and saved a lot of money!! We went in at 9.15, watched the creatures of the night show, got the tram then walked round the enclosures. I don’t know if we were lucky, we were able to see most of the animals, we didn’t have the queue for anything and generally the park felt very quiet! We got the bus there from an underground station which took under and hour and we left the park just before midnight. Would definitely recommend going in at a later time to avoid the crowds and maybe as we went on a weekday it was quieter. The animals were really active and it’s nice that you can’t really take pictures so just get to enjoy the enclosures without worrying that you need to get the perfect pic! Would definitely go again!!"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Extremely good value for money. Was picked up by taxi at the nearby hotel and by coach to the Zoo. Had a really good experience on the Night Safari, Fire eaters and animal shows. I was then dropped by coach at my hotel."
,,Very nice place,5.0,,"Its a famous tourist attraction for Singapore. However during night, not much animals are seen as most of them go to sleep or move their home. But since its a tourist spot, no one wanna miss it. There are eating outlets, firework dance. Overall a happy place."
,,Exciting!,4.0,,"It was the first time we visited the night safari, heard from our friends and gave it a try. Definitely worth the experience and would recommend for families with kids."
,,Seeing creatures in the moonlight,4.0,,"This is without doubt a really interesting and engaging experience. Seeing so many animals at night is very special. The safari is well organised, the trails are easy to follow and there is lots to see. A good variety of animals are represented and you will see most of them, as it is just a few (and it is only a very few) that might decide not to appear where you can see them. The ones you will see though, as a result of exceptionally well designed enclosures, are close and easy to see. You think you are walking through the jungle as there is nothing between you and the animals except a hedge of vegetation and a moat or a pane of glass; a window onto their habitat. We didn't see the show (it was on but full), the firedancers were there outside the barriers and gave a pretty good performance. Our advice, once you get through the barrier, is to take the tram first, as it gives you a great view of the large animals and gets you used to the lighting. Be aware though that you will have to contend with the human animal. Sadly, even at 21.30 our tram had a very badly behaved and noisy child that wasn't controlled by it's parent until the rest of the passengers (and unusually it was all of them) said enough was enough. Then when you wander the trails, there are the talkers that have to share their every thought at a volume that penetrates a 50 metre radius, despite the instruction to walk the trails quietly for the sake of the animals and other visitors. One thing that might encourage quiet is turning down the volume of the music at entrance/shops/food oulets - it's loud, very loud and its African beats can weary the life out of you in a very short time. Then there are the true morons of the species that bang the glass to attract the attention of the animals, despite clear instructions that this is upsetting for the animals and may discourage them from appearing. It didn't happen often, but it is disappointing when it does to see how insensitive man, and indeed woman, can be towards animals. All that said I am glad we did it - many of the animals are wonderful to see and so close you could almost touch them. At times it was magical. On the catering front, our advice would be to eat beforehand or bring something with you, as the food was clearly mass produced and very expensive. Drinks were also really expensive."
,,Its not a safari,1.0,,Really not worth the money. Animsls asleep dark and queues. Very expensive and really for no reason. Go to the amazing Zoo through the day but this experience is best left alone.
,,Special unlike any other experience - sureal & calm . Worth the effort!,5.0,,"This time I went to Night Safari & attended - ""the show creatures of the night""was excellent - loved the open air Shakespeare round open theatre sitting - quite similar. The tram ride was as ever really good too! Pleasant staff , every helpful . The animals really loved by all !"
,,Nocturnal animals,5.0,,This is located outside the main city. You can ask your hotel to arrange for the trip. You can take a tram ride of the forest and can get down at various stations and walk down the forest by yourself if you want to enjoy the thrill of exploring the forest at night. Use of flash is strictly prohibited. Its a great feeling to pass through the darkness of the forest. There is also a animal show. Dont forget to watch it. Price for it is included in your ticket.
,,Cleanest zoo,5.0,,This is a huge zoo. It's very neat and very well organized. Night Safari is one of the best in the world. There are lot of animal shows. Do check for timings and be available well before the start of show to get best seats with good viewing.
,,Recommended for all,5.0,,"If you intend to visit Singapore zoo so you must visit night safari, it shows you the life of animals at night naturally without a cage or anything it amazing trip."
,,Still an interesting trip,4.0,,"Came with Mum. Walked half the park not much luck with the animals, mostly hiding or sleeping. Then return to catch the crowded auditorium for Creatures of the Night performance. Remembered it used to be with more animals but MC was very interestingly funny. Tram was nice with commentary, wished they provide ear phones to listen in to the other languages. Breeze was welcome along the route. Some of the animals were by the side of the tram path. Tapir is so cute."
,,Night out,5.0,,Excellent night out with family. Had a great time observing the animals. Went about 8pm and the animals were quite active.
,,Night life at it's best,5.0,,Fully operated by trams with few walking routes too. First of its kind to see wildlife in true natural environment that too at night. Wonderful to absorb the animals in a silent night. Kids loved a lot
,,Great fun as always,4.0,,"The night zoo is a great way to see lots of animals not normally active during the day. We were treated to the wolves howling as we rolled past on the tram (which was awesome) and got to see pretty much everything else without any hassle at all.
The only lowlight was the staff funnelling people in to queue for the tram at the entrance, despite a 30min wait, when there are plenty of walking trails to explore whilst the queue calms down a bit. Well worth the trip out to the North of SGP."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,The Night Safari is a great activity in Singapore. I recommend to walk around the park first and do the train ride later. Less crowded and the waiting in line is shorter. You can see amazing and beautiful animals
,,Good experience,5.0,,Seeing the park by walking the trails and taking a tram ride was a good experience. The fire show was also pretty good. Enough restaurants to choose from to have dinner.
,,I love it,5.0,,It was the first in the world... U could see many active animals at night. Those animals that are inactive in day time become so active. They wander around you.
,,The night version of the zoo,4.0,,"You will see nocturnal animals, riding the tram is highly recommended. We rode the tram and witnessed a huge rhino coming up from his mud pool right next to the tram!"
,,Weekend with my in laws,3.0,,"I had a chance to go for a Singapore trip on a speaking engagement and my wife decided to bring along her parents for them to have a chance to visit this country. We arrived a day before my commitment so we happen to spend weekend with them. Since my in laws were not thatstrong enough to walk all day she included a night safari trip for them to enjoy nature tripping by riding on a tram. We arrived earlier than expected as the start of the tour was at 7:15pm. We chance upontaking some snacks at entrance of the zoo and enjoyed the wide array of foods within the food court. Food tastes good and worth satisfying though a bit pricey. The foodcourt will help you experience some roaming array of birds who never gets afraid to be close to guests trying their luck to get food from them.

The venue of the place is well secured and deals with all safety requirements to avoid any incidents. The queueing is not that bad going to tram as it had an effective system to accommodate guests. While on a tram, you would experience almost a close encounters with the animals in the vicinity though not all animals are easy to be seen and simply most of them are hiding. The tour guide can be heard and also being dubbed thr voice over but not as clear as you would expect it would be. The trip will only take you 30-40mins to cover all area. All staff and crew were friendly and helpful. Its been more than 10 yrs since me and my spouse have been here and quite impressed with the way they mainained it. Over all recommended for all ages."
,,Loved it!!!,5.0,,"Great experience and really enjoyed seeing animals at night. For tourists, take a cab there...easy and cheap way to get there/back. Food is expensive."
,,Great Zoo experience.,4.0,,A new twist on the zoo visit. Has a great riding tour in the beginning and then gives to time to walk around and get into the exhibits. Recommend you get there early and take an early tram. It’s popular so usually crowded. Bring a small flashlight.
,,Great Night Safari!,5.0,,"We attended the early session of the Night Safari (at 19,15) and very much enjoyed both of the organised events; the entertaining show and the tram ride. We had plenty of time afterwards to walk the various trails, and were able to stand and look for the nocturnal animals - on several occasions our patience was rewarded. It was all very well organised and slick. We're very grateful to a friend for recommending this to us and are happy to pass on the recommendation :)"
,,How to do Night Safari by public transport.,5.0,,"The night Safari is a must see in Singapore. It is awesome to see all the animals when they are active due to the darkness in their habitats. You come really close to the animals when you take take tram around the park. It is included in the ticket and we took the tram twice. The early tram trip was the best.
If you want to go there by public transport you can take the metro to Ang Mo Kio on the North-South line and from there bus nr. 138 to the Singapore Zoo, where also the Night Safari is located. It is cheap and relatively fast.
WARNING.: be aware of that all metro trains and busses in Singapore stops service at midnight 00:00.
So plan your return before midnight. We left the Night Safari so late that we ended up at metro station, Toa payoh. The train simply stopped service and asked us to leave the train.
It was at 00:00hrs and also the busses had stopped service.
We manager to find a taxi on the street and got home to our hotel."
,,Nocturnal animals. At night!,5.0,,"Really interesting and unusual animals. Don’t bother with the tram, walk around and take your time; let your eyes adjust. It’s worth going for the early slot as you’ll also see the crepuscular animals and there are fewer people. It takes about an hour to get there on the MRT and bus from downtown, for about 2 dollars with an EZT card, or you can take a taxi. Neither are a challenge."
,,A Different Way To See Animals,5.0,,"We decided to do the night safari and booked a visit via Trip Advisor - we were not disappointed.

We were collected from our hotel around 18.00 taken elsewhere and then transferred into a larger bus which then deposited us and others at the zoo.

Our guide got us all onto a “tram” ahead of the ordinary (long) queues which took us on a leisurely trip around the zoo with an informed commentary the whole time. Of course, sometimes the animals were not helpful and could not be observed In their areas, either hiding away in their habitat of simply still sleeping, but this is just the luck of the draw. What was fascinating was the lack of fences between us and them (they generally appear to have trenches around each enclosure, but it was difficult to see exactly how they managed this).

Afterwards we had plenty of time to follow the marked walkways around the zoo to observe the animals and stay longer in each place to look carefully and eventually find these nocturnal animals.

Then there was time to grab some food and drink from one of the zoos many food outlets (no fine dining here!), which was exactly what we needed.

Later we rejoined our bus and were deposited back at our hotel - definitely worthwhile and we will return next trip during the day."
,,"come for the animals, leave with a forboding sense of uneasiness about the conditions they live in...",1.0,,"I was looking forward to the night safari, the atmosphere at night is really emotive and feels sort of prehistoric. When we left though everyone in the group just felt very sad for the animals/conditions.
Its pretty expensive to enter and highly commercialised.
The elephant was in a small enclosure with a moat around it. He was in the corner facing the wall swaying and bobbing his head which I leant later was a sign of distress. The lions were pacing back and forth under floodlights in space about 10m long.

some animals definitely had enough space, especially the non-bitey ones that are free to roam but the whole experience made me feel guilty. I wish I hadn't supported it.
Child me would have loved it but adult me did not."
,,"Small enclosures, very overrated",1.0,,"Busloads of people gathered in front of the entrance...expecting to see something spectacular. In reality it is a 30 minute ride on a train through the park and you hardly see the animals because it is dark. According to the voice over on the train you’ll be ‘very lucky’ if you see the lion and an elephant and you might see a wolve.... well you will see them all, because the animals hardly have space to manoeuvre.
When you go to the zoo next door, you see much more animals and you see them much better. This is an absolute no-go."
,,We skipped the crowds and saw everything!,5.0,,"We got to the zoo early and eat before the crowds turned up. The food opens at 5.30. Decided to walk round the whole zoo which was a delight, saw the fishing cat fishing, the flying squirrel flying. Leopards snoozing, otters playing and hyenas stalking visitors. Recommend visiting in the twilight as so much to see then as things waking up. We had the walking trial almost to ourselves for about an hour which was magical. We were going to get back to the beginning and then go round on the tram but the queues were massive so just walked round again. We visited on a Sunday so actually a quieter day would have enabled this too. Overall brilliant!"
,,Singapore Night Safari,2.0,,"The safari tram ride didn’t stop long enough at each enclosure to view the animals, many times could not find the animals at all. Photography was virtually impossible. Other passengers on the tram ride very noisy making it difficult to hear the commentary. After queueing for the show and tram ride there was too little time left to walk any of the trails at a more leisurely pace. Would not go to the night zoo again, I think the day zoo would be much better."
,,One of the kind experience but short,4.0,,"Time flies when you’re having fun - they say, and it’s a perfect summary of my visit to Singapore Zoo during Night Safari.

Good thing to know about Night Safari is that although Google Maps you will find that the park is opening from 1930h (730pm), it actually opens from 1900h (0700pm).
In my opinion it’s better to come earlier than later. The dark settles already at around 1900h so you can be there at 1930h, easily catch night safari via tram and after that you can attend the night show with the creatures of the night. This last bit is important because the last show starts around 2130h so you will miss it if you come later.

Night Safari itself is a great experience and at one moment you’re wondering how come this kind of experience didn’t spread out around the world.
Photography is forbidden with a flash which is understandable. So if you want to take pictures you can forget about cameras on phones because even the latest flag-ship models of smartphones cannot produce even a medium quality picture in near absolute darkness while you’re moving on a tram.

My recommendation is - just relax, enjoy a ride, keep you’re smartphone in your bag, experience the event in the NOW, not waste time recording it so you can experience it later with grainy pictures and lousy recordings.

Night show which comes afterwards is great. Thanks to the great presenter it’s a part Stand up show with animals. You will have a lot of laughs and great time.
Here you will have enough opportunity for pictures, but when in dark you should also disable the flash on your camera so you don’t unnerve the animals.

There are two small remarks which I noted during the show:

At one point female trainer had one animal on its shoulder and volunteer from the crowd was a 10 year boy from Sweden. Anyhow presenter called the animal by it’s name, boy assumed he was talking to the animal, and the presenter noticed this and said he is talking to the beautiful one, not the ugly one, and at time pointing at the female trainer.
Some of the crowd even booed at that moment which was very justified.

Mate you’re are great at presenting and show is great because of your feel for the crowd and sense of your humor. Nevertheless that doesn’t give you the right to be rude and ungentlemanly. So I hope that you apologized to her - because the lady deserves it.

The other thing is that the show is just too short. This is probably done out of necessity and because there are lot of people. To counteract this, in my opinion the only option is to offer a second show at the same time, because it’s obvious that Night Safari as a whole is very popular.

So to conclude this review: I had a great time, it’s truly an experience you will always remember.
Nowhere else you will be so close to the animals like you will during Night Safari.
It’s just incredible, and the price is also reasonable.

Visit with your family or friends and have a great time, but remember - it will be over in a blink of an eye."
,,Did not live up to expectations,2.0,,"We, especially my 3 year old daughter, found the night safari very disappointing - actually quite boring.
Too many people
Too few animals
If you have been on a safari before, seen any animals in the wild, this is a waste of time! Rather go to River Safari or spend more time in Sentosa.
I would not recommend this if you have limited time in Singapore"
,,"A ""Must do"" in Singapore",5.0,,"Although we have visited Singapore many times, this is the first time we have been able to fit in a trip on the Night Safari.

Bearing in mind the large number of people there each night, it is very well organised and the timing between aech ""Tram"" means you feel as if you are the only group on the safari.

You see many animals, Elephants, Tigers, Lions, Giraffes, etc., etc. The sight and sounds of the animals make this trip a unique experience. (Unless you have been on a real safari !)

Although the animals are dimly lit with floodlights, my advice is to go on one of the first trams at dusk, because the half light will give you a better view, while still enjoying the magical effect of the darkness."
,,memorable experience,4.0,,I went to night safari with my family. Its a thrilling experience at night. Animals are totally safe and there is a gap between animals and tourist from safety point of view. Yo are supposed to move in a tram where they will take you in the safari of the jungle. Besides they have animals show also and stunt show as well.Experience was totally lifetime animals are also really cute. Besides they have friendly and well supported staff.
,,Brilliant,4.0,,"We had been on the Night Safari before, but didn’t see many animals! This time was different, also there were walking trails that took you along proper paths and you could see a bit more of the animals you had just seen.
One tip though - be prepared for a gigantic wait for a tram! Our Safari was booked for 8.15 pm, but as we were there already (Amazon Quest) we were allowed to queue up. We waited for so long - about an hour! Because we got on the tram at our booked time!"
,,Very good animal experience,5.0,,"The night safari is located close to the zoo. If you have a 4 park ticket, a visit here combines well with the River Safari, as each takes about 3 hours, and the night safari opens soon after the River Safari closes.

Tickets are timed at 19:15 and every hour after, though you really need to be there at opening to get a full evening of viewing. Arrive about 15 minutes before the timed ticket, as the first animal show starts at that time if you want to see it. There is a tram ride which you need to go on as some parts of the park are only accessible from the tram. Queues are very long at opening time, so it is better to do the walks first and then the tram when the crowds have dispersed.

There are the usual standard animals there, but also ones you are unlikely to see elsewhere.

To get the full experience, I would recommend spending about 3 hours there. It takes over an hour from the city by bus/MRT, but we found that going via Choa Chu Kang rather than Ang Mo Kio to be the easier route. Bus/MRT fare from the city is around S$2.

There are water dispensers all over the park, so you only need to take an empty bottle. Food is available inside the park and outside the entrance to the zoo, both local and fast food, though those at the zoo close around 19:00. Expect to pay more than you would in the city, but not too excessive."
,,Well organized,5.0,,"Since there are specific time slots to enjoy the night safari, it was very good that there are other things to do before queuing at the entrance.

Before the ticketing counter you can already go around the are to check well carved statues and other animal decors. We visited during the Lunar New Year and they made the area very festive. Furthermore, there were a lot of souvenir shops around and an dining area when you'd feel famished. Food they offered was quite limited but was relatively cheap in a way.

Around 6:30PM or 7PM, there would be a fire dance show to entertain you while waiting for the park to open.

When your schedule is up and there are just too many people queuing for the tram train, you can opt to join their animal live show first or do the walking trail. The tram train queue may be long but apparently when we did decide to join the queue it was fast moving.

The trip around the safari took around 40-50 minutes and it was really amazing to observe night animals roam around without being placed in cages."
,,Work in progress?,4.0,,"Visited as part of a booked tour. This was a night tour which was supposed to allow visitors to see animals in a natural habitat at night. Whilst this was a good tour, we were not allowed to use flash photography - no issue if you know, but do not do the night tour if you expect to take pictures. There is an amount of building/remedial work ongoing (Feb 2018), not sure when the work is scheduled to be completed?. An ok visit but unable to comment on animal welfare etc. Not fussed to visit again."
,,Beyond Incredible - World Class Wildlife Experience,5.0,,"Wow, Night Safari has been an absolute highlight of our trip to Singapore. After spending the afternoon in the adjacent Zoo (which by the way, is also amazing), we had lunch in the food court as the sun set and the queues formed for the 8:15pm session. We visited during Lunar New Year, so as expected, it was really busy. We waited for probably 35-40mins for a tram, but once we were on, we were so glad we stuck around! The tram takes you from the buzz of the entrance to the quiet depths of the zoo, accompanied by an English speaking tour recording that blends informative facts with well thought out conservation messaging to perfectly submerge you in the world of the incredible creatures viewed. It was an out-of-this-world experience to be present with animals such as asiatic lions, Asian elephants and Malayan tapirs under low wattage, moonlight-like lighting. Truly magical. These wonderful creatures seemed so at ease with our presence, a signal that they live content, enriched lives. I really hope that the hoards of people that visit here have a similarly magical experience, and walk away empowered to do something to protect wildlife. Thank you, Night Safari!

PS my only suggestion to travellers would be to pick your time slot carefully during peak periods. If you’re not travelling with small kids, it may be best to opt for a later time, as a means of avoiding queues. When we left at 9:45pm, there was hardly a line for the tram, so 10:15pm might be a good option. Have dinner in the CBD and then jump in a cab to night safari for the highlight night of your trip!"
,,What a fabulous idea,5.0,,"Went here with a few work colleagues and what a great trip it was. Only open at night, well it is called the Night Safari and it really is a great place to visit. I would recommend going on both the walk and the tram ride as each offer different views of the animals in the park. We saw a huge range of animals in. A tiger, leopard, lions, hyenas, bear, deer, bats and lots more. Photography is difficult due to the darkness and you will really need a higher end camera to take photos as flash is not permitted. Overall, very well worth a visit."
,,Great experience!,4.0,,Have a 4 year old and 7 year old made them sleep in afternoon so they could fully enjoy this experience which they did! I would get there at opening time and enjoy some dinner as plenty of food options there we got there for 8.15 but was very busy and queued for about 15 mins for the safari ride! The creatures of the night show was great and educational and the walking tracks allows you to see the animals for longer than on the safari ride! If it rains you get wet on the walk and in the show as outdoor but the safari ride is on a covered train so not too bad!
,,Don’t bother unless you want to see farm animals at night,1.0,,There’s not much to see here apart from some farm livestock and a couple of caged lions - don’t bother unless you’re really bored or suffering from insomnia
,,How it worked for us.,4.0,,"We purchased the four attraction ticket on our first visit to the zoo. We had to nominate a day and time for our Night Safari so we chose the earliest slot (7 15) a couple of days hence.

We spent the afternoon visiting the nearby River Safari and finished there about 5 30. We then walked the short distance to the Night Safari and had a meal in the food court. By 6 30 we joined the queue which had already formed.

At 6 45 we were called in to see the ""Creatures of the Night"" show which takes place in an amphitheatre within the park. The best seats were reserved for tour groups so we found ourselves sitting in the wings, but still had a good view.

The show does not start until 7 15 so there was a bit of waiting. I won't spoil the show for you except to say don't volunteer to help unless you are comfortable with snakes.

The show lasted around half an hour and was entertaining, then we were directed to the trams for our Night Safari. The queues are well-managed, but there was quite a wait in queues before we boarded our tram.

We expected to see pretty much the same animals we had seen in the zoo a couple of days previously, but the tour takes you to a different part of the zoo. The lighting is subdued, but you can still see the animals although there wasn't enough light for photos.

Some animals (eg Lions) are in compounds, but others such as deer are free to roam. There is a recorded commentary in English and we got good views of the animals. When the tram had finished its tour which lasted perhaps half an hour we were free to walk along designated paths to re-visit the animals, but after a full day we were tired so we left the park at around 9 30.

Taxis were waiting and there was no queue so our taxi which cost around S$20 had us back to our hotel in Marina Bay by 10pm.

I guess opinions are divided. There was a lot of waiting in line for half an hour or so of animal viewing, but seeing the animals at night was for us a unique experience which we enjoyed."
,,Great safari,5.0,,"you are advised to book your tickets well in advance also its better to pick the priority pass as the que at the gates are very long and may take hours to get a slot , the buffet dinner at the ulu ulu restaurant is quite good worth the price , do take all the trails to experience the safari up close"
,,"Lots of animals, but couldn't see very many",4.0,,There were lots of animals there but unfortunately we couldn't see a lot of them. The night we went was extremely busy. Fire dancers at the entrance were brilliant. Best bit was being about 4 metres away from an elephant on the tram ride.
,,I like the tram,4.0,,"I went to the zoo for 3 hours, had to wait until this opened at 7pm, so I was pretty tired by the time I got on the tram. I watched the creatures of the night show, which I found to be terrible. It was slow and painful and catered to small children (I'm 30). I may have gotten to see a few animals I couldn't see on the tram, but I really want to leave early but they asked us not to do that since they use the isles to move animals up and down to the stage. The tram did a through job of telling about the animals, their status (endangered vs little threat), and current threats to their survival. I thought the tram was very well done. I did not walk around after the tram because I was too tired. It's hard to do the zoo and night safari in the same day and maximize you're experience, in my opinion."
,,"Absolutely Outstanding, I believe only Singapore can put on a show like this,",5.0,,"As you enter you are led to what looks like a series of Tram Cars but with rubber wheels so that the animals are not disturbed. They seem to be in their natural settings and environment. An ideal experience for both adults and children. The tour is professional, clean and beautifully managed. An absolutely outstanding and beautiful experience. Don't miss it as you will never see something and unique as this."
,,Jungle flavored journey,5.0,,"The tourist spot found overcrowded. It took long to wait inside as we were in the queue for near about 01 hour. At first we took a ride with open tram which was really amazing. My kids enjoyed a lot mixed with fear from presence of dark light & sudden activities of animals. Nocturnal animals were found awaken & engaged in their activities in habitats closed to natural shape. We were super impressed with the range of animals including elephants, lion, tiger, hippo, rhino, hyena and so on. In some instances we were very close to the animals moving freely. There are few tram stations. It took long to complete the tour.

After enjoying the tram tour we observed the ""Creatures of the night"" show which was an excellent experience. Dramatic way to open the show, the host of the show who can speak more than 06 major languages, the animals and all the staffs are just amazing, They made the show alive and really entertaining. This is a must see show.

This is really a very nice place to physically observe wild animals in nocturnal activities. Ticket fare is $45 but seems worthy. Different food zones are also available near the entry area. Food prices may be little costly. One can bring foods inside even."
,,Too much waiting - few animals - OK experience,3.0,,"There are slots for entrance to the park - not only the trains. We waited one hour just to get in... Make sure you have a ""pass by"" card to reduce the waiting time for the safari train. We felt it was few animals, too dark to see so much. However an interesting experience to see it it the night. Many animals were ""Sleeping"". I think this was waste of money..."
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"This was a total waste of time and money. The venue was overcrowded with people acting like animals pushing and shoving to gain entrance position at the various venue positions. The ""Show"" at the beginning of the evening was totally lame! We attempted to go on the tram for an initial tour of the park, but the line was so long we didn't have time to wait for a turn. So, we started to tour the park on foot. The object is to view the nocturnal activities of the animals. One walks along an asphalt path to each dimly lit position where a nocturnal species is present in it's natural habitat. I would estimate that we were able to see an animal at about 30% of the positions. The remainder appeared to be empty because the nocturnal animals must have been hiding. For $45 per adult the night safari is overpriced."
,,Lived up to expectations,4.0,,"As I expected from the reviews and having done the Night Safari a couple of times, Singapore Zoo is a great zoo. As other reviewers have said it’s not the biggest zoo, but it’s well planned, clean, informative and like most things in Singapore the attention to detail is outstanding. You feel like you get really up close to the animals, the elephants and rhinos were highlights. Shows were good too - really enjoyed the sealion and elephant shows. We travelled via MRT to Khatib and then caught the shuttle bus ($1 each way) - worked well."
,,A little overrated but still fun,3.0,,"Visit is fairly well organised (visitors grouped by time schedule) although we did have to wait 20-30min to actually get on the tram/bus. Cute animals, most of them awake somwe enjoyed the visit. I read many people asking whether doing the tram or the walk visit: do both! You’ll enjoy it a lot more! Other tips: have dinner before coming (food is crazy expensive) and book your Uber or taxi to go back to Singapore (the queue at the taxi stand was over 45min and waited 25min for our Uber)."
,,Loris,5.0,,"Had a great time I'm the night safari. Was super impressed with the range of animals we were able to see. We did all the walking trails and the tram ride, and would strongly recommend taking the time for both. The walkways are really clear and in some cases you can get very close to the animals which is particularly breathtaking. Would definitely come back and do it all again!"
,,Must try,5.0,,It was an awesome experience. The ticket is quiet expensive cost $45 but worth it. There's a lot of restaurant inside the zoo along the entrance. Best to visit around 9pm bcoz it has less tourist and we trail for an 1 hour and tram for almost an hour.
,,Interesting experience!,5.0,,"I went here with my friends and it was an awesome experience.
First, the shuttle tour that takes you around the zoo is a must-do, which you can know some information or fun fact about animals, and most of the animals are adorable, just remember do not use a flashlight during the tour.

We went to see the show ""Creatures of the night"" after the tour, and it was beyond our expectation, the host of the show, the animals and all the staffs are just amazing, they made the show alive and really entertaining so please see the show if you have time.

Even though it was late but we still decide to walk through the trail a bit, we thought we won't finish it but it was really exciting to walk through all the trail so we finished it at last. And I highly recommend you to walk into some of the trails that you can get really close to animals, maybe it's a bit scary, but it's definitely an unforgettable memory.

To sum up, even though the zoo is a bit far away from city center, but if you have spare time, and you haven't seen any animals for a wild, and you're seeking for some entertainments different from others in center Singapore, then please come here, it may take your whole night, but pretty worth it for us!"
,,It was ok,3.0,,"I came with mum, we did get transfers to and from the hotel which was good though couldn’t really take many photos, it was too dark plus you’re on a tram that takes you around so quality of images weren’t great either, the zoo I think is much better and half the price."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Although the idea of a night safari is interesting, I’m not 100% sure this one in particular was special... yes, it was good to be driven around to see the animals, but I didn’t feel it was much different from walking around the zoo. The ride itself had a good recording of the info - and also available in a few diff languages if need be. Not everyone in the tram was willing to respect the “no flash photography” rule, so it gets annoying quickly. Avoiding the daytime heat was the biggest bonus to be honest...."
,,Don’t bother,1.0,,"We have been to Singapore a few times but hadn’t been to the zoo & friends of our said the night safari was a must do , oh dear what a mistake it was , it was a waste of our $’s & our time ($64 each) you can hardly see any animals , most are asleep or very hard to see in the dark!!! Maybe a better time in the daytime but we thought it was not worth it , lots better things to do in Singapore"
,,Amazing expereince,5.0,,"Firstly, DON'T try to do this and the main zoo all in one day! It's a whole separate zoo not just the main zoo in the dark. You can take the tram ride but you need to walk too to see all the animals, so wear good shoes and insect repellent.
The animals are seen in a totally different way and that's what makes this so interesting. It's very hard to photograph them so there aren't so many people trying to get selfies all the time, but it is VERY BUSY. All the tour groups have this on their itinerary, and it's Must See so be prepared. At opening time (7.15pm) the queues for the tram are huge, so walk one or two of the trails and get the tram later from one of the other stops.
Highlight was the prowling tiger."
,,"Awful food, could barely see the animals",1.0,,"Dinner came first, lots of low quality choices, like fast food, I ate a salad and pineapple. They said they had sushi, there was three pieces that had this green stuff on the top, wouldn’t touch it. The salmon was tiny thin slivers with attached skin. 5ey were slow to refill the dishes. Do not do the dinner! Then you are headed into a maze of ropes to board the tram. Animals are on the right and left, but because it is dark, they are difficult to see. The rhino was shaking his head back and forth, which looked unnatural, and was in a small enclosure. There were a lot of deer species. Note, this is not part of the zoo, which I wish we did instead. After the tram ride you can walk different paths, but again, the animals are difficult to spot. This unfortunately was the last activity we had in Singapore, and was a total disappointment. You are picked up at your hotel, but then we had to transfer to a different bus to get to the safari. Going back we had to stop at a few hotels before we were at ours. Everything else we did was great."
,,Most terrible customer services in the world! Don’t waste your time!,1.0,,"We bought four 19:15 tickets online and we came on time. The staff in front of the entry told us to redeem our e-tickets at the corner ( he pointed at that corner at the same time). The queue was very long and we spent almost 30 minutes for lining up. When I came to the machine, the staff told me my e-ticket couldn’t redeem there! But I was told by the zoo staff to redeem there!
I queued again at the counters, and there were almost 50 persons! It was 8:15 already! I saw 21:30 time slot still have quota. When I came to the counter, they redeemed my e-tickets to 22:30 time-slot!
The woman staff in counter admitted that it was their fault to mislead us for lining up in a wrong queue! Also it was their fault that they didn’t update the ticket information! But they didn’t let us enter the park???!!!! And we need to wait until 22:30!
DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME!
I experienced the worst customer service here and I won’t come here again."
,,Night visit,4.0,,We did the night safari. It was very well organised and the zoo itself very well laid out with pleanty of places for food and drink. We watched a show with several of the zoos animals it was very entertaining. We had a ride through the zoo on a tram and information about the animals was vey good.
,,Night Safari at Singapore,4.0,,"This was the first day of our tour and almost every tour operator will begin their itinerary with night safari at Singapore as tourists can get proper rest after their tiring flights and can visit this place at the night.
This place has many animals ranging from lions, cheetah, elephants, giraffes etc
You will like the the place if you like wildlife.
One thing I didn’t like about the place was that during the night it is very hard to see any animal,many a times it happened to me that I was not able to see animal.
Further if you are siting on the right you can’t see the animals on the left properly and vice versa.
Rest everything was very nice, we bought few goodies while coming back."
,,Best Zoo/Animal Experience,4.0,,"The animals were more active than any zoo/animal enclosed experience in the past. Nocturnal = a great night safari. Don’t just take the tram (main feature), but walk the trails afterward. Handicap accessible trails. Thrill or SE Asia jungles that would normally be lethal, in the security of controlled environment! Restaurants, souvenirs, and shows at the main entrance helpful during wait for assigned entrance times (7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm, 10:15pm)."
,,poor crowd management!,3.0,,"i have been to night safari and it used to be great. but now, the tram queues are longer, and most of the time not a lot of animals to be seen, either hiding or sleeping. but most shocking for us were the queues to the creatures of the night show. we were herded in one area, while tour groups were ushered in first. then we were made to walk to small/narrow stair passages leading to the seats, so many people in one area! i have a companion who has mobility issues, and we cannot rush to take seats as fast as the others. there used to be a time when tickets have the show schedule so each guest have guaranteed seats to watch the show, but now looks like people are just crammed in every space. not nice for us."
,,Night Zoo,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing, we went when it was quiet and it was awesome. All the animals out and about and time to look at the all. Would highly recommend."
,,No public transportation after midnight from suburb to downtown!,4.0,,"The Night Safari itself was good and very well organized. Although we didn't see all the animals but we've seen a decent amount of them so that was pretty cool. However, my only complain is about the public transportation. You won't find any MRT or bus services from the suburb to downtown/chinatown areas after midnight where most visitors are staying. If the Night Safari management doesn't think it's their responsibility to tell people, shame on them! As a night event organizer, don't they think they need to let their guests know so they can better plan their trip? My husband and I were visiting from Vancouver Canada. Our subway closes at around 1:00 am. Hong Kong is another Asian city which is closely competitive with Singapore and their subway service closes at around 1:00 am. Therefore, I would never imagine this actually happened. We appreciated what the park could offered and tried to get the most out of it. So we watched the show, took our time to walk all 4 trails, and at the end took the train ride. It was around 11:20 pm by the time we left the park. Then 10 mins wait for the bus (30 mins ride) to the closest MRT station. We arrived the MRT station a few mins after midnight and found that we were stuck. No more train. We panic but still managed to run to the bus hub downstairs to see if there's any buses to Chinatown, no, no more buses to Chinatown. Then we were told the only way was Taxi. Night Safari opens at 7:15 pm and they even tell people the average time spent is 3-4 hours. Hey my friend, I'm telling you, if you do spend 4 hours or more, prepare to take a taxi, walk home or camp outside the park."
,,fun fun fun,5.0,,"we really love the night safari!!! it is a well organised establishment and kids love the tram ride while looking at the nocturnal animals. this is a 20-30mins tram ride activity and walking is not necessary unless if u opt to do a trail walk with your family which is a personal option of course. since it is an easy breezy activity, night safari highly recommended for young kids and senior citizens. we went for the 7pm session which is super packed! so.. i would highly recommend for u to have ur dinner first and go for the 8pm or 9pm session where it is less congested with people so u dont have to queue up too long.
it is definitely a must do activity with kids while ur in singapore and have fun fun fun!"
,,African night feeling,5.0,,Loved the Safari ride and show - saw more animals than at the Zoo during daytime 🦎😊you Would do it again- an absolute MUST if you like wild animals
,,Better than expected,4.0,,"My wife and I had wanted to see this Safari but had some doubts about what to expect after reading some reviews. If your time allows then you can make the most of it quite easily.
With no time constraints or children in tow we booked on line for the two of us for a Tuesday, 9.15pm tram via WeekendGoWhere. Tickets were $32 each saving $26 before we’d arrived.
To get there we took a bus from Beach Road, needing one change for around $7. It was the end of rush hour so pick your timing carefully. The 2nd bus went straight to the entrance.
We arrived around 8.45, in time to see the fire show, then walked straight onto a tram, less than half full, with no queue. The 40min tour was good, nearly all the animals were visible and moving - not always a given from our experience. After the tram we walked round,m the 4 trails, again, not many people, and lots to see at our own pace. The Flying Fox was the highlight.
Only thing we missed, being midweek, there was no 1030 show (only Friday and Saturday).
For the return to Beach Road, as it was 1145pm we took an Uber for $12.50.
Enjoy it!"
,,Great Visit - Go Early,5.0,,"The night zoo experience is most enjoyable. I say expearience as there is more than strolling through a zoo at night. After having our ticket scanned, we were ushered to an amphitheater where we were watched an interesting presentation about night and dusk animals with many animals presented by the trainers. Then we were taken to a queue for the tra ride though the zoo. The animals and habitats were backlight so it was like seeing the animals in moonlight. We observed several guides at road crossings keeping walkers safe and on the trails and off the tramway. There is a group of very entertaining Thumbuaker tribespeople providing a great show of torch dancing and fire breathing. We prebooked the 7:15 time slot, but realized when we got there that was the time for the show in the amphitheater, not when they opened the gates - so be queued up early to get the beasts seats. The zoo complex is located about 30 minutes outside the CBD and is not well served by direct public transit. Your choices are tour busses from central hotels or taxi. Taxi from the Hilton on Orchard was about about 20 SGD each way. There was a well organized taxi queue at the end of the show."
,,Patience Will Be Rewarded!,4.0,,"This review is for the Night Safari / Night Zoo, 1 of 4 parks comprising the Singapore Zoo.

If you buy a ticket during the day, they will make you choose a date for you to go to the Night Zoo and you will be given a ticket with a time on it. You won't be able to enter the zoo BEFORE the time stamped on your ticket, but you can arrive anytime after it (my ticket had 7:15 pm printed on it but I arrived at 9:00 pm).

Based on other reviews, I went on a Friday night and did the walking trails instead of the actual vehicle safari to avoid lines and crowds. The walking trails were very quiet, and I was able to see many active animals doing things they don't normally do in the day. The key to a good Night Zoo experience is patience. I saw many guests who spent 20 seconds at an exhibit and walked on if it was empty. If you stay and wait, your patience will more often be rewarded than not. Just because I waited while others left the ""empty"" or ""boring"" exhibit - I was able to experience:
- A pride of lions all standing up to stare into the darkness at some far-off quarry, with one on the hill pacing and roaring repeatedly into the night. Hearing a lion's roar while standing alone in the dark was eerie and incredible.
- A hyena emerging from the darkness of the trees on a 15 foot rock/hill in the moonlight, who stared at me and followed me as I left his enclosure area. It was unnerving and amazing all at once.
- A group of 6-10 young river otters playing in the stream in the moonlight, making adorable chattering noises.
- A group of porcupines wandering around, playing, and grooming each other.
- A cloud leopard perched on a branch, alert and listening to all the sounds of the night around him.

And so many other unique experiences. Go to the Night Zoo, do the walking trails, and be patient!"
,,I personally didn't enjoyed much,3.0,,Over priced as far as the attraction is concerned . Not much variety in animals. Only the experience is to travel in tram in the night through jungle .
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"It is a must visit attraction in Singapore. It is an open zoo visit animals across the world. Very interesting concept! Although, since it's at night, the pictures don't come out well."
,,Must Visit in Singapore,5.0,,The Singapore zoo is amazing. I went for the night safari and it was incredible. You must watch the shows lso that they have there.
,,Recommand to the Family with Kids,4.0,,"Similar to the experience in Chiang Mai, Thailand, the night safari serves a tram for the tourists to watch the animals along the journey. Furthermore, there are different live show and trail avaible for the visitors. Recommand to the family with kids."
,,Not very amazing day zoo visit is far better,2.0,,"Nothing amazing about the night safari expensive ticket can be avoided, day zoo visit is far better. Food is horrible at the zoo. Very far off location too from city."
,,Great place for a night outing,4.0,,This is a great option for a night outing. I am surprised at the number and variety of visitors here! It’s abuzz with activity and the trail options are certainly worthwhile if one has insomnia! Of course the tram rides are an option too.
,,Feb visit.,4.0,,The tram ride and walking trails were wonderful. The night show to us was a bit hokie. Too much talking and not enough animals.
,,See wildlife differently,5.0,,"The Zoo and Night Safari aren’t on the MRT, so having some time, we took the bus out (Google Maps is your friend here) which certainly gave us a different view of Singapore. Many of the migrant workers, normally hidden, live on this route, so you do see how others live. The bus can take at least an hour. Taxis are cheap and quick in Singapore. We got one back (around S$25 and under 30 mins to the city centre).

Once there, you can spend three or four hours here if you want. There’s a ‘tram’ ride around the park, which shows you the highlights, and helps you orientate yourself. There are organised shows (which we skipped) and then a whole series of walking trails through the park. There are a great way to see, hear and smell the animals and birds.

It can get busy, but thins out as the evening goes on, so I’d say unless you have kids or want to see the shows, get there a little later, but be prepared to stay until late. You can book online so skip the queues.

Fascinating, and definitely recommended"
,,Very disappointing,2.0,,"I was looking forward to this as went on it about 10 years ago and it was a wonderful magical trip.
This time it seems they have created a different park for this safari, and there was a lot of vegetation but not many animals to be seen, compared with my previous experience which took place at the zoo used in the daytime. The enclosures for the animals were very small compared to the daytime zoo, and the walking tours were not very interesting, but more importantly the tiger was pacing up and down and showing well known signs of distress which we were not comfortable with, and felt this was not the way to treat such magnificent animals. Would not recommend this and was disappointed at the changes."
,,Amazing experience in the night zoo.,5.0,,"What a memorable experience in the night zoo, everything we saw was amazing. We are very animal fond so to see first hand the lions running around and roaring or to see the elephants up close was just a treat for us.

This is a fantastic experience and a must do in Singapore."
,,Great trip,5.0,,"Excellent trip, well organised, extremely friendly, professional and helpful staff. Great to see some of the nocturnal animals moving around. Great show with good audience participation. Would highly recommend this tour for everybody, especially for kids."
,,Great place but tiger is in tiny enclosure,3.0,,"We love visiting this place but sadly this time, the lone tiger seemed very sad and distressed in his enclosure. Generally the animals seem happy here but I couldn’t watch the tiger. He was pacing up and down and crying out. I like what this...More"
,,Great fun!,5.0,,Let me give you a tip for visiting Night Safari. If you got your tickets for 7:15pm entry be there at last one hour earlier because the que is sooooo big. We were there at the entrance at 6:45 and 7:15 slot was full already...More
,,Must do trip,5.0,,"This attraction is really fabulous. There is a show which is ok, but the best bit is when you get on the tram, which takes you on the safari. You get really close to the Animals, and its a great experience. You can upgrade to...More"
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,We visited with toddler. Initially worried about this. But found their tram ride so convenient me and my wife don't need to worry about her. We enjoyed the full ride and commentary.
,,Good fun,5.0,,"Another must do when in Singapore. A bit difficult with younger kids as it only opens after 7:30pm but worth keeping the kids up for...or if you're battling jet lag, a good option. We were first in on tram at 7:15pm and stayed until after...More"
,,It’s up to the animals.,4.0,,"A 45 bus trip to get here, the safari could have been great but many of the animals weren’t moving, but that’s a risk you take. The Wolf Howling at us and White lion rumbling some deep posts made it enjoyable and worth the entry...More"
,,Mixed feelings,4.0,,"We took a tour that apparently gave us priority tram access although we still seemed to wait quite a while to get on a tram. We did like the tram tour, you get to see a lot of animals, very frustrating with people taking photos...More"
,,Wonderful !,4.0,,High point of our trip. You see animals in their natural habitat at night enjoying a meal or snoring around. Have company as it's a little unnerving to be alone in the jungle. The animals are well cared and some rare species are present here.
,,It's what you make of it,4.0,,"Went on a Thursday night in January, on my own. I was really just interested in the experience of seeing nocturnal animals in a zoo-like setting. I arrived shortly before one of the shows which I skipped completely and set out to walk all of...More"
,,One of the best I ever visited,5.0,,Amazing experience that you must have even if you don't like to visit zoos! Try the night tour to leave a unique experience
,,Lions and tiger after dark,5.0,,In the jungle the mighty jungle the lions sleep tonight.....Lets face if the most of us will (luckily) never end up with wild anmial at night time in the jungle. This safari is a real nice and unique experience. When you are driving through the dark forest and take a walk through some parts and you hear the lions/tigers in the background that can give you some chills. Absolutely recommenable.
,,Wastage of time,2.0,,15 minutes of tram ride to the same areas which have been alrdy explored except a few one but there were no animals.snd they announced too that keep a distance from animals so what if an animal like a lion or a bear attacks ? Tram was open .long queues but it just got over in 15-20 minutes.overall a wastage of time .this time can be used for some other purpose.
,,Singapore Night Life with a Difference,5.0,,"Before you enter the Night Safari, enjoy a fiery welcome at the park entrance. Yes, witness a thrilling fire show (fire-twirling and flame-throwing to jungle drumbeats) by ""jungle warriors"" to start your evening adventure. The first show is at 7pm (I think it is performed hourly, the last at 10pm).

My wife and I chose to head right away to join the queue for the ""Creatures of the Night"" Show upon entering the park. We were rewarded with good seats in the middle section (free seating on first-come-first-served basis) and were treated to an entertaining show that featured various noctural animals... there was also the staged commotion in the audience arena... (Oops! Too much said...visit and see for yourselves!).

After the show, we have the option to take a walk through the various trails/tracks or the night tram. We chose the latter for compliemntary guided tram ride, complete with audio commentary in English on the various noctural animals. Fortunately for us, the queue moved pretty quickly (we were told by friends later that we could pay S$10 for express boarding, i.e. queue cutting).

The tram ride was comfortable and gave ample chance to spot the night creatures. It was great viewing the animals from a comfortable distance although we could have taken a walk through the well-planned trails/tracks and spend more time with the night creatures but we didn't have time that evening.

As a resident in Singapore, I have signed up for the ""Friends of Wildlife"" card and can have unlimited visits to all 4 parks for a year (zoo, river safari, night safari and bird park). So perhaps, in my next visit, I will take a walk...

The Night Safari is highly recommended (especially if you love wildlife in the night). Make sure you are dressed comfortably, and wear some insect repellant in case (or you can cover your arms and legs). I had writen a review of the Zoo already, and will do so for the other 2 parks after my next visits..."
,,Great for all ages!,5.0,,"If you have only time for 1 zoo, I recommend the night safari as it is different from most zoos around the world, but if you have some time, I recommend to start later in the day, go to the Singapore zoo in the afternoon, and then head to the Night Safari when it opens!

It's a bit of a hassle by public transport to get to train, then bus from ang mo kio station, but there is also an attractions bus which is direct from orchard road etc, which takes you there!

Enquire at your concierge, or check the website for the closest pick up near your accommodation, and it's also reasonable pricing.

If you have a family or 4 people to fill a cab, it might be easier to just take a taxi directly! Had a fun filled day!"
,,Too busy!,3.0,,We are a family of 5 with teenagers and a toddler. The night safari show was informative and good but there was limited seating. Also the queues for the tram were shocking which made this experience not so great for us. The journey once on the tram around the animals was nice but overall we didn't come away saying wow we would do that again.
,,Very exciting,5.0,,We enjoyed the train car round the zoo in the dark. Get there early as there are long queues.Also you do see the animals more clearly st dusk rather than when it is dark. The show which we also queued for is great for children but if you are an adult party it is not really worth the queuing. Do try to take at least one of the walking routes as it is very magical walking in the zoo at night. It is adequately lit and a very different experience than by day.
,,Wasn’t as great as expected,3.0,,Reading all the reviews we had great expectations for this place. But the tram ride was for 40 min in which mostly we saw different kinds of deer. Most of the animals were inside or sleeping so it was just travelling for most of the time. Felt it was expensive for the ride they gave.
,,Bad,2.0,,"Big mess, long queue for show, long long queue for tram. Queue in stuffy, crowded, over crowded. Mess people traffic management. Awful experience. Wonder how they haven’t made any improvements for such a long run."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,Night safari experience was unique compare normal zoo trips. Lot of animals to see. Must visit attraction if you are in Singapore
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Probably one of the best places in the world to see nocturnal animals roaming freely. Kids love it and, like the Singapore Zoo, it's a perfect venue to introduce youngsters to nature and to teach them the importance of respecting and protecting all animals."
,,Feedback for my visit to Night Safari,2.0,,"Very crowded, long waiting time, Very dark & heavy rain, could not see animals clearly Anyway, nothing special"
,,Fascinating but crowded,4.0,,"The night safari opens at 19:30 and closes at midnight. There is a show you can attend (which quickly fills up), but the main two things to do are to see the animals on for or by a tram. We went for the 20:15 timed entry ticket and made the mistake of queuing for the tram. Even on a weekday this took fifty minutes, which was pretty tedious. There were trams every few minutes, but not enough to make much dent in the crowds. The journey itself has a commentary as you drive around the zoo and see the various animal enclosures. The animals are not in cages here but rather there are ditches to separate the wild animals from the visitors. Clearly the ditch for the Asiatic lions is wider than that for the antelopes. The nice thing is that you have the impression of seeing the animals in something's close to their natural habitat rather than behind bars. We then explored the walking trails, which cross cross the park, and by the time we returned the tram queue had melted away. In retrospect we would have done the walk first, then returned for the tram. This is a zoo and not a circus, so there is no guarantee you will see any particular animal. When I first came here I saw a row of fishing cats with paws poised above the water, but this time they had gone into hiding. However you will see plenty of wildlife. The zoo is about half an hour taxi from downtown hotels, and there is a taxi rank at the exit so you can get back quite easily. I am puzzled as to why other zoos do not have such a night experience, especially as the one here is wildly popular, so clearly makes plenty of money."
,,Great to visit in the weekdays,4.0,,The place is great to visit in the weekdays especially when there's less crowd. The fire show and animal shows are awesome and the tramp tour makes for a relaxing and enjoyable evening.
,,Exciting As Always,5.0,,"The tram ride was the most exciting experience we had at the night safari. Being able to get so close to the animals, its something you don't often get to do in zoos. The trails are fairly long and we were too far away from the amphitheater to catch the ""creatures of the night"" show. Oh well, guess we have to return again!"
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"We went on a tour with the night safari, saw many nocturnal animals, a totally different experience to the day zoo and it was truly amazing."
,,Night Safari Tram,5.0,,"Very different kind of experience and it was great! Riding the tram to see the ""wild"" with audio that gives information about the animals, really educational!"
,,Enjoyable trip 😊,4.0,,Hi brought my niece and her family since they were from Australia. My niece actually wanted to see the wild cats but she was actually a bit upset because mostly all of them were sleeping. But overall she was happy due to the Kidsworld zone.
,,Everything is great except crowd,4.0,,"I suggesting come later as possible to avoid crowd. Everything else is so great, entertaining. Walked the whole park after take off shuttle to see what can't be seen with shuttle."
,,Worst customer service at ticket desk ever,1.0,,"Everything went pretty well, but as you know, you have only one chance for first impression. The lady at ticket desk with name Nurhudaya just imagine that she is a queen of the world and can change all the rules whenever she wants, but in fact her job just a customer service. I don't know why she moved all of us in the line, we've been first and after her manipulation we stayed at least sixth floor n the line. Only because she thought she is goddess here. People like her never should work in customer service. Rude of staff is the worst thing what could happens in such popular place. All the rest excellent."
,,good safari,4.0,,An important attraction in Singapore the night safari is quite enjoyable.While moving in tram one is able to see different animals in their natural surroundings.however.it was not as good as expected.Perhaps one should go on trails if one had time to have more thrill.The tram service was good and efficient .
,,a massive scam and an embarrassment for this amazing country,1.0,,"This is a massive scam, a monumental tourist trap
What would be a one ride inside a large park in any normal amusement park, becomes a single attraction that costs 45 sgd, for a 20 minute tram ride to see some very sad and bored animals, mostly deer...
The place is overcrowded, they allow people with later time slots to enter early and so you wait 1.30 hrs to ride the tram, and basically have no time to do anything else afterwards
They of course sell you an upgrade ticket while you are online, for 10 sgd, to jump the line
they claim to be a wildlife preservation company but they are instead a very greedy one that only want to pack as many visitors s possible every night, so perhaps they donate a few cents to some non profit, but they did not convince me that they care about anything else but money, let alone the animals
The problem is not only the money, people come to singapore for few nights, and instead of spending the night walking along the river or enjoying this amazing city/nation , they spend an hour getting to this remote place, 3 hours total or a 20 minute tram ride which is crowded and packed with local families or from across the border in malaysia, with screaming kids, sweating their souls off, while the staff is rude and non caring
I don't know why the singapore tourist board endorses this attraction (they sell tickets to it, so thats approval of the quality) since this ruins the reputation of this country , where everything else is perfect
I realize the company provides a lot of local jobs and taxes to the economy, but it is an eyesore
I hope my review helps other families spend their time and money better in singapore
Even my 11 years old boy said this was a waste of tiem......and he loves animals so that says a lot"
,,Waste of time&money,1.0,,"Wow-daughter&i really looking forward to this""highlight""..but from the swarming noisy queues&crowds to the deafening""creatures of the night""show&poor animals this is inflicted upon,we couldnt leave quick enough..the dismal trek tracks are boring enough but to have even that chance of peaceful roaming&viewing animals is ruined by the continual blast of the loudspeakers/shouts&chatter from the endless cycle of crowded trams circlingAVOID THIS PLACE if you value an opportunity to see/experience nature."
,,NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 5...and LEARN THE VALUE OF SILENCE,5.0,,"Seriously one of the best zoo experiences ive enjoyed...BUT...the the thing that destroys it is the fact that the ppl are not told to be QUIET...fish market ambience does not contribute to making this the amazing experience it shud be...leave ur kids under five at home..they dont appreciate it and as for babies, SERIOUSLY???ppl reviewing that they couldnt SEE anything coz its DARK..its a frikkin NIGHT SAFARI...IT needs to be dark...animals are hiding coz some asss still use flash photography and most of the ppl are making such a rukkus that im suprised any animals venture out at all. Travel in Asia has taught me that the locals and the nearby tourists di not understand the value that silence can add to this experience...u dont need a bloody photo...just enjoy it.. to management, conside private vehicle tours..id pay for that because seriously the ppl in the tram ruined what was otherwise an incredible experience for me...the big elephant...ill take that image with me forever..."
,,Over Priced poor experience of a Night Zoo,1.0,,"I do not see how the adverts for the night Zoo are so poaitive. I fail to understand why people are giving the Night Zoo trip 5 stars, when they have even make adverse comments. My experience was very disappointing. I found the tram ride disappointing, as many of the animals were hardly visible, (OK it was a night trip, but why?) saying it was a rinforest experience? We passed at least two lots of deer, and two lots of pigs, informed one group was different to the others as they had tusks, which I heard people around me saying I can't see them..
Surely many of the animals were not really night animals, but in enclosures close to the road and by feeding stations. At the end of the tram ride we were ushered into the night show, (unfortunately it started to rain and the show had to be cancelled). Was told there would be a show later. I decided to do the walking trais to at least get something out of the evening, which I will admit was a better way to see the animals, however I did not realise how long it would take to get back to the night show so arrived late was informed it was full and I should have taken my seat by 9pm. There was I believe to be a later show, but as I had arrived by MRT and bus, and the last tram back to Singapore was 11pm, I could not do this. There was no offer of a refund.

I give it 1 star half as the Zoo was open, and half for the fact I did have a slight reduction, as I had travelled by Singapore Airlines, (TIP tell them you travelled with Singapore airlines you will probably only need to give them a flight number, but take your boarding pass in case). I considered the whole experience an over priced tourist trap, would have enjoyed the evening more having a meal in a hawker station."
,,Concerns for animal welfare,2.0,,"We went on the night safari and I wish we hadn’t. The commentary in the trams was extremely loud, there were kids screaming, and that must have an effect on the animals. Some of the larger animals also didn’t appear to have much space. It felt quite theme park-esque. Think this is the last zoo I’ll visit."
,,"Different way to see animals, very good",4.0,,"I really enjoyed this as it was something different. Definitely do the trails as well as the trams. Do the trails first as everyone crowds at the start trying to get on the tram and it is a long wait. The show was good as the creatures didn’t really perform, they were mainly just introduced to the crowd and taken away again."
,,Great outdoor visit on a good fair weather,5.0,,"Depends on your live and interest about water animals mainly fishes , and famous panda. This place can be hours of fun on a good weather weekend. must try river cruise and safari ride. Wheelchair friendly environment."
,,Good place,3.0,,"I enjoyed the night safari there, but if you are opting for river safari then don’t opt for this, as they both are pretty much same"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"We went to the night safari. It’s nice if you have children, but nothing too exciting for adults. Too dark to actually see most of the animals. The creatures of the night show was good. The wait for the tram and the show is very long and the ride and show are very crowded. I think it’s overpriced for what you get."
,,Beautiful night jungle safari,5.0,,"Its a beautiful night jungle safari, a must do in singapore. Experience the jungle and the animals at night."
,,Not worth the money,1.0,,You hardly see any animals .. the bus that drives you make so much noise that you can’t even hear the driver talking about the animals .. supper busy... They advertise about so many animals that they don’t even have
,,Must Do Activity,5.0,,"We totally enjoyed being at the night safari. Worth every penny. Saw this white wolf, gave us goose bumps when it hawled. Magnificent, to say the least. Carry a really good camera if you want to do photography there."
,,Night Time Safari,5.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed the safari. The landscape, the animals and the animal shop after the tram tour were excellent. Singapore really knows how to do things right!!!"
,,Unique!,5.0,,I loved this! Very unique experience. Really worth it! I advise buying an express ticket with a travel agent. We bought ours through a travel agent at the hotel and went with a group. The queues would have been really long without an express ticket. We barely waited!
,,Poor activity,2.0,,I was poor activity. Must of the animals hide in dark sides and you can not see them. The ticket price is too much and for turn back city you lost buses and should take taxi with high rates.
,,Not worth,2.0,,"We arrived about 7 pm and was told to wait tell 9 because 7 and 8 entry were fully booked. Most animal were sleeping. Though, the show was nice"
,,Best Way to meet Creatures at Singapore Zoo,4.0,,This is simply the best way to see animals so close to them. It is important to be patient and go early to avoid rush and get the first round... And please no flash lights of cameras!!!
,,great fun for families,4.0,,"We went to this attraction without not much expectation, and turns out to be ok. Night Safari opens at nights, so it is better to have the dinner early before to get there. The ticket includes a bus ride to take you around the park (around 45 mins duration), which we have seen some animals (you have to keep the eyes open because it is dark. Make sure you attend the show after you finish the bus ride."
,,Value for money,5.0,,"True value for money. Start with fire show at the entrance followed by live animal show, tram rides and finally take all walking trails for closer look at wide variety of nocturnal animals. Also remember your contribution goes towards wild life protection and research on their behaviour and how to make them the part of the nature as inclusive members.."
,,Live Jungle Visit......... MIRACULOUS,5.0,,"I have no words to express my feelings after visiting the safari. Let me try.
What's Good....... It is thrilling to imagine wild animals in there natural habitat and that too at night......wow.
The safari is 25 kms away from the city and taxi took 30 dollars and 35 mins to reach the place. Entry was convinient as we pre-booked our tram tickets from VOYAGIN at 30 % discounted price.
The open tram was ready to board at the allotted time slot.
The safari started at 9:30 pm and took almost 30 mins to complete the trip with audio commentary. There were dim lights in the animal enclosure and it felt like we are very close the wild animals without any cage or protection.
Conclusion.......a must visit for every age and either go after dinner or can have food at the food joints located there. Returning from the place is easy as you get taxi as well as bus too.."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Better to do Tram ride first and then attend the show. Not able to see much animals in walking trails.
,,too short,3.0,,was very fast and visibility was less as its in night and many programs and shows were cancelled so i felt we missed on many things
,,Family fun! Profession staff and informative!,4.0,,Came here with my family and younger siblings. For children this is amazing and for adults too! It's so great to see the kids so excited waiting to see all the animals amongst the evening sky. Even if you're an adult without children I would recommend. I don't really like zoo's and made an exception to come with my family on the safari I was pleased to see all of the space and how well treated the animals were. Although this did not take away from the fact the zoo still had a polar bear which really breaks my heart! Other than that it is something fun to do with the family or as a tourist.
,,Night Safari - getting back to your hotel,3.0,,"Last night we went to the Singapore Zoo Night Safari which we enjoyed. It was a good idea to book the first tram trip at 7.15pm as they put out feed near the front of the enclosures just before the start of that tour so we saw almost every animal. The only drawback (if you don’t go on an organised tour with hotel pickups and drop offs) is working out the best way to get back to your hotel after enjoying all the attractions the Zoo offers as a great deal of time is spent waiting in queues. We enquired about taxi fares and were disappointed the people at the taxi stand initially feigned ignorance about the approximate cost to get to the nearest MRT station. When pressed, they vaguely indicated $20-$30 SD. Their very indifferent attitudes were a poor advertisement for Singapore tourism especially as we have found most Singaporeans to be extremely friendly and helpful. We soon discovered they were “ripping us off”as a shuttle bus to the City was $6 and a local bus was $2.20 to an MRT station next to the bus terminus. We were staying at the Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport. As we weren’t on any organised tour it took us 2 hours to get back using public transport. We had to leave the Zoo at 9.15pm so we didn’t have time to see all of the attractions as the last train left Tanah Merah for Changi Airport at 11.18pm. Such a shame! If you are staying at a hotel some distance from the Zoo make sure you organise your return trip before you go so you don’t get stranded or have to pay a hefty taxi fare."
,,Awesome Enjoyment,5.0,,"It is a place for all. From 6 years to 80 years everyone can vouch for this. The cart ride taking you in the midst of the safari is just awesome- need to experience it to savour it. You can get down anywhere for a trail of animal , which could be thrilling and adventurous. The pack of lions, Malaysian Tiger and zebras to Hippos all pretty astounding and marvellous. The family with kids will surely freak out to see all of it. A must see place in Singapore."
,,Book ahead to get in early,5.0,,"Another great Singapore zoo. This one has the nocturnal animals in lower lighting so they are more active and relaxed.

I do recommend booking ahead. Maybe even a week or more if you are going on a weekend in a holiday. They limit the number of people entering each hour. If you can get into the show early, that is great. Arrive before your admission time as they do queue up. The tram ride gives you an overview but you miss heaps and to see it all you need to do the walking tracks, just head straight for that."
,,Great concept and e perience,5.0,,"Visited Night Safari, this was great. I recommend going here as part of your trip. You can take the tram or walk the trails to see the animals."
,,Just go to the zoo,3.0,,"We queued early for the tram ride and we’re able to get on the second tram of the night. Viewing the animals was a little difficult as the enclosures were appropriately, dimly lit. The other problem we had was we were sitting in the last carriage near the back. The tram would stop occasionally so everyone could get a better view of the animals, the problem was those in the back weren’t in front of the exhibit. The tram would then drive off so we never got a stationary view. We also walked some of the trail later but the animals were still difficult to spot. The highlight was the roaring of the lions. The fire show was entertaining but we were unable to see the creatures of the night show as it was cancelled due to the light drizzle. The food was average and expensive. The zoo was a far better experience and many of the animals are at both parks."
,,"Was great, but extremely crowded and more disorganized this time.",3.0,,"This is my third time visiting the night safari over the past few years, and I have to say, this visit was my worst. You need to have a ticket for a timed entry, however, when we arrived we were faced with huge crowds and a very long wait. We arrived a little earlier than our scheduled entry time because usually they have a 'fire dance' in the restaurant however the crowds were so large we couldn't even get close enough to see any of it. Once inside, there was a huge rush for the night safari 'trains' that take you around the night safari and the night animals show was already full 30 mins before the show was supposed to start! It was quite difficult to move around for the first hour we were at the night safari. However, once we got into the 2nd show, it was great- the show was exactly the same (still good) it was the last time I'd visited 3 or so years ago! But still very entertaining and funny. There's quite a bit of walking and a few slopes. There are also a few steps/plank like parts so those may require a stroller to be held, but otherwise it's not too bad if you needed a stroller for younger kids. The paths are a bit narrow but it all adds to the jungle atmosphere. We had to keep waiting for a ride of the safari tram- over an hour before we actually got a ride! But we kept ourselves entertained walking around and looking for the animals in the dark. Kids had fun wandering around the zoo at night, but I think it would have been a much better experience if the park had been a bit more organized in staggering the entry times and controlling the crowds."
,,Overrated,2.0,,"Overrated. Animals were fine but not so different from what you would find in a day zoo. Otherwise, we had to wait in line for 35 minutes to go on a 35 minute tram ride.

We also couldn’t watch the show since it filled up quickly for both showtimes. So much for crowd management.

لا أنصح بالذهاب إليه، بعيد وما يستاهل أبدا."
,,Unusual Experience,4.0,,"Haven't been to a night zoo before so the experience was totally different to a standard zoo. Excellent experience and definitely should be purchased with the Park Hopper (Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park at $78 p.p) if time allows.
The tram ride is great but unless your going in peak periods I wouldn't bother with the Skip The Line Pass. We went in mid January and no issue on standard ticket. The 4 walking tracks that you can do after the tram ride are definitely worth doing. The best part is that you see a lot of the animals up close and very active as they are naturally nocturnal and when you see them during the day at a normal zoo, they tend to be at the back of the enclosure and asleep - not the case at the Night safari."
,,Beautiful Zoo,4.0,,"I have been twice to the Singapore zoo, the first time to experience the night tour, which we really enjoyed and the second for breakfast with the orangutans. You don't get to interact with the orang-utans but you do get to eat breakfast with them near by eating their breakfast. There is also an opportunity to have photos with them and these are done by a photographer who offers your photo for about SD$40, as well as an assistant who will take a photo with your camera for no charge. The buffet breakfast was delicious."
,,Hot walking,3.0,,"I'm never really sure whether I should go to animal attractions due to the question of welfare and I must admit I did see some animals displaying zoochosis which is a shame. It was still very hot to walk around the zoo even at 8pm and i found it quite draining - as some others have said if you've been to a zoo before, it's not really any different. It's just slightly different going round at night but it's quite a drive from the city and I don't think I would return."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,This is another top attraction of Singapore. Dont take photos with the flash on. You feel like you're in an actual safari when you see the animals while you passby. We couldnt watch the light and sound show since it started pouring down.
,,Average - and organised,3.0,,"Average - visit - was some thing different - we did the River Safari and Night Safari on the same afternoon / evening. Well organised, the show was nothing special. Took a cab back to Orchard that was only around S$20."
,,A MUST GO PLACE,5.0,,Night safari is a must watch place. One hour tram ride through this safari takes you to various animals within touchable distance with running commentary. Greta Experience.
,,Great evening activity for the whole family,5.0,,"Highly rate this, we've been to plenty of Zoo's but never a night Zoo.
Went with 3 boys - 5,9&9. I was concerned over them being too tired and cranky but due to no walking required we all had a great time. We ate an early dinner before our taxi to the Zoo.
Book tickets ahead for the 7.30pm train and arrive early to be at the front of the queue, no waiting around unlike 100's behind us and equally first into the 8.30 show as well.
Animals were good, some active and some not but well designed ride and very efficient with their queuing system.
The night show is worth going to. The presenter was very funny - for both kids and adults."
,,Great tour,4.0,,"My husband and I did this tour booked through viator but conducted by tour east. The guide and pick up was great.

Buffet felt a little rushed but the food was really good.

Tram tour good although would be nicer to have s guide rather than pre recorded info as sometimes got mixed up.

Walks were good and pretty amazing to see animals more active than during the day

Overall would recommend"
,,A novel concept ..,5.0,,This is a zoo in the night but worth every second of it .. was expecting a good experience and got a great experience .. Not to be missed attraction for any age .. If traveling by public transport be wise to check the timings as it is quite far from the main city ..
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Really good Safari with a variety of animals. The disappointment is quality of food available at the zoo. We ate chicken and pasta both tasted really bland and old. We didn't even finish third of the food.
,,A close encounter,5.0,,"The Night Safari might be the most expensive of the four wildlife attractions but it is well worth the cost. You get very close to the animals in the park with no barrier. Take a tram to get a quick overview of the park but I would recommend heading back to explore on foot after.

Bring mosquito repellent!"
,,A well worth while experience but very busy - beware public transport times,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the Night Safari. Would urge visitors to head back into the park on foot once they have taken the tram ride. The show was so busy and our timing was unfortunate so in the event we ran out of time and did not get to see the show. A word of warning for anyone using public transport / MRT. We left the park just as the 9.30pm show was starting and just missed a bus meaning we had to wait about ten minutes for the next bus. On arriving at the MRT station we had four minutes in which to catch the last train back into town. Leaving the Night Safari later than 9.40pm will mean you miss the last MRT.
,,Relaxing Ride,5.0,,"Summary: 30 mins of shuttle, 30 mins of animal show, and 1 hour of nighttime zoo. Very good experience.

Note: The later you arrive, the less light there is to see the animals through the camera.

Our family was confused of what was to be expected, but got into line and onto to a open-air shuttle. Think Disneyland parking shuttle. From there, we drove slowly through animal enclosures taking pictures in the artificially made moonlight. It was hard getting shots to even be visible, but it was very cool to be so close to the animals. The ride lasted around 30 - 45 mins.

We followed the crowd into an animal show that got cancelled due to rain 1 minute into the show.

We then walked the Wallaby trail and found that it weaved between the roads used by the shuttles. The temperature was perfect and it was wonderful walking through the jungle seeing the animals. Definitely the best part of the safari.

Unfortunately, we had to run through half of the trail to catch the next show. Which consisted of well-trained exotic animals and fun acts. Everyone's favorite was the otters, of course."
,,A wonderful family experience,5.0,,"We are a family of four who absulutely loved our recent Night Safari Experience during our stay in Singapore. This a must do and well worth the trip. Like everything in Singapore, so well considered and organised and so unique at night. We recommend the tram first followed by both trails, this will ensure you catch all of the amazing animals. A tip on getting out there:- ensure you book a shuttle from your hotel or get your Tourist travel pass at the airport and opt for the MRT and one of the two connecting buses directly to the zoo. Buses from ththe city take too long in peak hour traffic. Get yourselves to Night Safari and enjoy!!"
,,It was okay....,3.0,,The night safari seemed a little over rated. It was a nice tram ride however the animals are not lit up well enough if you go after dark. Plus the tram driver only stopped so those in the front of the tram could get pictures.....it kept moving for those in the back (us).
,,Very well-ran attraction!,5.0,,"This attraction was very well-ran and a unique idea. Staff were friendly, exhibits were great although sometimes hard to see because it was in the dark; however, trails were well-marked, you are not exposed to the heat and humidity that can be pretty draining during the day time, and overall - a great unique experience. This is a great idea for families (both with young and/or older children) and also for those who are interested in animals."
,,Great night out,5.0,,"We went to the Night Safari after visiting the Zoo and River Safari. We booked dinner at Ulu Ulu restaurant for a buffet dinner and went to the Night Safari after dinner. We were booked in for 8.15pm and started lining up at 7.30pm. We were sitting on the tram to start the Night Safari at 8.10pm. The tram ride went for over half an hour viewing the nocturnal animals at night. We then walked the Night Safari following the walking tracks. This was such a great experience as it was raining, dark and quite eerie at times walking through the jungle to each exhibit. The paths are very dimly lit with all the enclosures having lighting equivalent to moonlight. Flash photography is not allowed. The highlight for me was listening to the lions roar and watching them tumble around in their enclosure. The hyenas were also quite vocal and all the animals were active in their enclosures. This is really a must see and do while you are in Singapore."
,,Great way to see the animals,3.0,,"We visited the Night Safari, it was a great way to see the animals. We chose only to take the tram tour which sees about 80% of the animals, rather than walking. Word of note, given you are travelling on a tram and at night, your photos of the animals will not be so great. Tram tour lasts about 45mins. The restaurants at the end of the tour are okay, although nothing to rave about. The fire breathing exhibition was the highlight. We spent 2 hours at the park, and found that to be ample."
,,Safari Adventurer Tour - Expert Guide!,5.0,,"My family and I did the Safari Adventurer Tour at the night safari zoo and it was really great! This option is more expensive but if you are looking for a VIP experience it certainly delivers that. What made this experience really memorable though, was our guide. She was enthusiastic, funny and had a wealth of knowledge when it came to the animals we saw in the park as well as conservation and the history of the night safari zoo. From was we were able to see, this experience is MUCH more personalised than the standard tour buses and we got to spend considerably more time observing the animals, as tour bus after tour bus sped past us. Dinner, entrance to the animal show (which was great and didn’t exploit the animals), and the guided tour (partly in the electric cart and two longer walks on the trails) were all included in this tour."
,,"Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night SAfari",2.0,,"I was extremely disappointed with the Zoo and the River Safari . It is not worth the pricey tickets. The animals are mangy, underfed and do not seem to be very healthy. I did not see shiny coats on any animals, always a good indicator of health. The worst were the orangutan and chimpanzees. The animals seemed bored and didn't have any or many objects to stimulate them. The enclosures aren't very large and the size of the polar bear's tank broke my heart. If you're an animal lover and can't make up your mind about the necessity of zoos, avoid this place.

I saw two shows and the one on the elephants is slightly more enjoyable though the scars on the elephants' legs told me the methods used to train them.I regret choosing to visit this tourist spot this time round. Avoid it unless you're getting free tickets somehow.

I went on the boat ride that is free...believe me that I would have been very bummed had I to buy a ticket. You see only undergrowth and the tops of a few giraffes. The 1 hour wait was not worth the ride.

I had gone to the Night Safari in 2016 and that was a more enjoyable experience. That I would say is worth the expensive ticket.

Use the MRT to get there from where you can then catch a bus that costs 2SD."
,,Night Safari a highlight,4.0,,"The night safari was fun to do for a family, and a nice way to enjoy Singapore after the heat of the day."
,,Make sure you walk the safari trails,5.0,,We had a great time here. Tips - Eat before you go.. and after you’ve done the train make sure you go for a walk down the various trails.. it’s an experience and the children loved it. Don’t forget to get skip the queue tickets.. otherwise you’ll be waiting for ages.
,,Bit of a rip off.,4.0,,"Not bad, the Singapore Zoo during the day is probably better. Expect long queues for the ride around the zoo and for a taxi after. Value for money, 3/10.Long wait for taxis after the Safari also. There is better value for money things to do in Singapore for sure."
,,Night Safari - Average,3.0,,"Though lot of Hype is given on this, this is not as attractive as it is said. Moreover, I felt it is a disturbance to the animals when the van is driving in the night (even though they did not honk). Many animals also not much visible. if you are hard pressed for time, you can safely skip this"
,,Patience with wild night fun,4.0,,It was our first visit to this park .. Missed the first show as we did the walking trails at first ...After finishing our trails we did the tram and finally creatures of the night show at last ... as earlier show was full .Saw few animals while sitting on tram but saw a plenty while walking the trails ....Icing on the cake was Lion feeding as it was very informative & enjoyable
,,A life time experience,5.0,,"Book intelligently and be on time be patient you would experience something, memories of which you can carry all your life. Manage time and sequence in suchba way that you dont miss the shows and rhe tram ride. i suggest go for the 7 15 shiw first and then for the tram. Attempt walking if you have the steam."
,,ok,3.0,,"ok, not that great; maybe because I went to the zoo on the same day that's why it's just ok. veryyy long queue for the tram"
,,Waste of money,1.0,,"Waste of money and waste of time, we barely saw any animals and I don’t even think there were any giraffes in their supposedly encounter, the lion was fake, it didn’t look natural at all the movements were very repetitive and robot like. Complete waste of money do not recommend unless you want to see some pigs and dogs"
,,My second visit,5.0,,"I first went to the night Safari twenty years ago and was very impressed. Visiting Singapore with my children I wanted to share this experience with them and it did not disappoint.
We took a taxi from our hotel which took about 25 minutes. I had booked the tickets on line and nominated 8.15 pm time. We had to spend about 10 minutes in a queue before the trolley took us around. The tour took about 40 minutes.
We particularly enjoyed the lion and elephant displays. Most of the animals enclosures have a moat and then a low shrub to hide it so it is nice to see the animals with a safari feel (ie without having to look through bars.
Our whole family loved this and I would highly recommend it."
,,Loved the night safari,5.0,,It was a sudden trip to the Night Safari as I went with my family on the final day of my trip and it was an amazing experience. My kids extremely loved it and I would highly recommend the tram ride and the river safari. I am looking forward to the 5 amazing parks that they are planning to make by 2020 in the same area. Good luck and enjoy the night safari as it is definitely a place to go when in Singapore.
,,The whole family enjoyed this attraction,5.0,,"We went as a whole family, my dad , who is on wheelchair, kids and adults. So it was completely wheelchair friendly and staff were at hand to help. With the holiday season, it was super crowded. However they let my dad through another entrance and was on a priority line.
It was amazing to see all the animals at night, the information on the tram was so helpful and educational. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.
Word of advise, buy your tickets before hand online. They have a specific number of tickets per session only."
,,Must do,5.0,,"this is one of a kind.
One of the most relaxed safaris.
weopted for a tram which most people do where an autonated voice guides you as and when you pass various enclosures of animals.
They are really upfront and with hardly any fencing so its quite thrilling.
they have an option to walk and roam around too.
kids loved it."
,,Walk!,4.0,,We were able to cover all four of the park’s trails on foot in 2.5 hours. Much better to walk than to be stuck in the queue for the tram! 4 stars because more should be done to manage rowdy tourists who hog display areas and disturb both the animals and other visitors along the trails.
,,Its Good Experience,5.0,,Overall a very good experience if Night Safari they take you to the jungle in a English open tram and show all the wild animals it is good for family and kids
,,Unique conservatory experience,5.0,,"We visited Night Safari at 9 pm on Friday night. It was packed but not uncomfortably so. Should have visited earlier (at 7 pm), as there are walking trails that we weren't personally comfortable trekking at a darker time. The ""Creature of the Night Show"" was entertaining and educational, although some people may criticize trained live animals. They explained, though, that their training method is not coercive, but I am not here to judge. The overall area was clean, and only smelled dung (very understandable) at few places. No mosquitos detected, but we put on our repellant oil anyway."
,,A magical evening.,5.0,,Especially after 10:30 when the park was nearly empty and we were alone on the walking paths. All we could hear and see were the animals. The weather and temperature and ambiance were all perfect.
,,Crowded and noisy,2.0,,"Parents insisted to visit since they liked it so much during their last visit to Singapore 10 years ago. It was absolute madness and we very much regretted our decision the moment we arrived.

A limited number of tickets are sold to access at different times. We purchased the 8.15pm slot. We arrived at 7.45pm, and despite being ushered to the front of the massive crowd and allowed to enter at 8pm (thanks to the old folks we had with us), we were unable to make it for the 8.30pm show.

The staff advised us to take the tram first, and go for the 9.30pm show. Big mistake! The queue for the tram took one full hour (despite coming in before the 8.15pm crowd, and being told the queue would clear ""in 10-15 minutes""), and by the time we finished, the 9.30pm show was also full. We could have queued up for the 10.30pm show (45 minutes queue...!) but then we would have had no time to walk around at all.

The biggest issue was that the park was so crowded, that it wasn't fun at all. We remembered the night safari from 10 years ago being such a quiet and magical affair, but this time it was all pushing, shouting, crying kids, queuing, waiting, etc. There wasn't a single quiet moment, and even during the tram ride the people/kids were constantly chatting and shouting.

All this for S$170 for 4 pax after discount, definitely not worth it!

They seriously have to further restrict the number of people per night, otherwise I would not go again.
The way it is now, it looks like a desperate try for profit maximisation without considering the experience the night safari is supposed to offer."
,,Not your typical Zoo,5.0,,"The night safari is one of the most interesting experiences in Singapore. Plan your visit before sunset so you can watch some of the free performances. There are also restaurants that are affordable so make an evening of it. The tour of the ""open "" zoo is conducted on tram, and takes you through the park so you can see the nocturnal animals in their natural habitat. This is all outdoors so the evening means its less hot. MRT is not available so allow enough time to get there by taxi. Well worth the journey."
,,A must see for children and adults,5.0,,"Make sure you visit the Night Safari in Singapore; even if you without kids. The animal enclosures are lit beautifully and the golf carts take you as close as possible to them. Along the ride, have a look at the shows that this attraction has on offer. They are really entertaining."
,,"Don’t bother going, waste of time, money and effort",1.0,,"We did the right thing and pre-booked and paid for tickets ($60) online for the 9.15pm entry for the Night Safari with tram ride as advised. Needed the tram as the wife is awaiting surgery for an Achilles operation mid January. Paid $40 for the taxi ride to get to the zoo. Presented our tickets only to told we had to queue to change printed tickets for their Wildlife Reserves Singapore Group ticket. Did that, then told we had to queue to have them checked. The line was past the taxi drop off point on the main road. Once through this checkpoint, some 50 minutes later, you then have to line up for entry to the Night Safari complex. Did this and kept our cools. Unfortunately, left the premises after we heard over the PA system that the wait time for the tram was at least another 90 minutes. We confirmed this with zoo staff. They also advised that the zoo closes at 11.15pm. Doing the maths, we are not going to see much. Would you believe that we also had a queue to leave. What a waste of time and money. Overall, after the taxi ride back to the hotel, spent $130 to have the privilege of lining up. This is one place I will not go back to and you should seriously re-consider.

Their response:
“Regarding tickets, we encourage guests to purchase Park tickets from our official online store in order to skip the ticketing queue, as e-tickets will be emailed to guests, so they do not have to queue again onsite to redeem physical copies of their tickets. For ticket purchases from our partners, we are currently working closely with them to make the ticket redemption process more efficient. In the interim, aside from having self-service kiosks, we have also increased the number of ticketing counters operating on peak nights.

Once again, we appreciate you sharing your thoughts with us. We hope to serve you better should we welcome you and your wife to the Night Safari again, and we wish both of you a healthy and happy 2018!”

They do no seem to care. No advantage to booking in advance and they don’t seem to care if there is a problem."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Great Unique experience to view wild animals in night in their natural-like environment. Overall a great experience.
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"Night Safari have always been amazing as it gives us a chance and opportunity to peek into the lives of these animals and also to learn more about them. Do be quiet when you visit as these animals have heightened sense of sight and hearing and might go into hiding which means you miss the chance to see them. Also take note that some animals are really camouflaged and hidden, making it really hard for you to spot them."
,,Night safari tour,5.0,,Awesome way to see the nocturnal animals great tram ride and knowledge sharing audio Then an awesome easy walk around the park after
,,Nothing much to see except goats.,2.0,,"I purchased 3 ticketes on line for a 15% discount. After I bought, my Friend told me on another site, it’s only $31/tix. Such a disappointment."
,,Had fun,4.0,,"I've been to the night safari before. There is no difference or changes. Good experience for my children, no see animals at night was something new for them."
,,Continue improving,4.0,,The presentation was changed from last time we visited. We believe it has been improving to meet visitors expectations.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"A beautiful park and a unique experience. However, it rained (our own fault for booking in the wet season) so all the shows were cancelled and we could not walk any of the trails. The tram tour was speedy, it did not slow down at any of the animals and all our photos are blurry due to the speed it went past everything."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Brilliant experience, loved seeing the animals in their natural habitat, especially the free ranging ones."
,,Crowded and very noisy,2.0,,"We booked our tickets online for the 8.15 pm session and arrived in good time only to be met with a very long queue to the tram. We were asked to start with the walking track and come back to the tram later. The walking tracks were also very crowded and full of families with small children that were very noisy and not very well behaved, pushing in without being controlled by the parents. We didn't see many animals as they most likely were hiding away from all the noise.

We came back to the visitor centre by 10pm only to find the queue to the tram still being very long so we decided to have dinner. The food were lovely and we had a great meal. However as the tram queue were still long after dinner, we decided to leave the place, very disappointed not being able to cover the whole event."
,,Too crowded to enjoy,3.0,,Visited with my family during Christmas break can didn’t really enjoy the safari was it was too crowded. Tram ride was fine but the rest of the shows and line to get to it was just ridiculous. Would suggest to control the crowd in future so visitors can enjoy the safari
,,Too crowded!!!,2.0,,"Unfortunately the Night Safari is much too crowded! You stand in line for everything: buying the ticket (luckily we bought it online), to get into the Safari and to shows. Getting back to the city afterwards was a nightmare. Things are not organized well and the place was so full that I don't think its good for the animals as well.
The icing on the cake was that, while waiting in line to go to the Night Show I was pushed so hard by others waiting in line that I dropped my phone, causing terminal damage. Not only was this unenjoyable, but now I also need to purchase a new phone."
,,Please spend your money elsewhere,1.0,,"we brought my 3yrs old daughter 1st time to the night safari and we had the worse experience ever. being to most of the place of interest in asia i think this is the worse experience in our own home.you guys better up your level of service.

we reached the place at 730pm and didn't realise that there is a time allocation into the premise. Fine cause we didn't do our research online and it was our 1st time there, we only managed to get hold of the 1015pm time slot. we explore the map and mark down and show my daughter what we want to see later on. one of the highlight was the ""creature of the night"". and our nightmare begins

at 10pm we started queuing as the show starts at 1030pm but we were greeted with a long and disorganise crowd and the inefficient scanning of the ticket didn't help we only managed to clear the queue 40mins later and there were still a big crowd behind us.

We made our way to the to the amphitheatre for the show but was told that its full house and we were not allowed in. imagine the disappointed and the difficulty explaining this to our 3yr old daughter. you guys simply over sold the tickets to us in my opinion, your staff can still have the cheek to say this is a complimentary show, come on we paid good money into the night safari what the hell do you mean its complimentary nothing is free in their world. thinking this leads to no where arguing with your usher we decided to move along.

we saw a long never ending queue for the tram to tour the night safari, and was deciding whether to walk or take the tram, we saw another usher name MARCUS, we ask him how long would the queue roughly takes he answer 'how would i know"", my sister reply what do you mean you don't know you are working here aren't you? he then shouted back with his open arms like a hooligan
"" how am i suppose to know with this many people. hello i mean you are the usher and is working here if we don't ask you who do we ask? i walked over and shouted back at him for his attitude and asking for his name with all the tourists looking at the commotion and shaking their head looking at him. what a image he has created to the tourist around us acting like a bouncer in a club.

we wanted to leave the place and ask for a refund there and then but we couldn't bear to disappoint a 3 yr old kid. we decided to take the walk as we don't want to wait in the queue only to have the place close at 12pm and end up only have an hr or so after all these episode.."
,,Absolutely Amazing,5.0,,"We saved the Night Safari for our last night in Singapore & it didn’t disappoint. We had already been to the zoo and the River Safari which were great. The Night Safari was even more amazing.

It is definitely worth walking all four trails and then jumping on the tram to do the tour as there are animals in each that you only see in that part of the tour. Singapore Zoo & their keepers are to be highly commended for the truly wonderful conservation & care they invest in these animals."
,,Great Night of Adventure!,4.0,,"The overall experience was great. Although the waiting time for the ride was quite long, but its understandable as it was peak season. During the ride, I noticed a lot of people speaking and therefore I couldn't really understand the announcement. I would advice to provide headsets for better listening.

Really cool experience. 100% worth the money! Thank you!"
,,"Smart, convenient, easy to see some of the best animal specimens from the world",5.0,,"of course we went in the middle of the tourist season so we knew what we signed up for. but everything was so well managed, and disciplined so the 45 minute wait to board the tram didn't seem as long as it actually was. our daughter was delighted by the fire eaters, the animal show and of course the drive around the park. we also did the zoo and it was just as much fun. this has to me a must-do for any first time visitor to Singapore."
,,Night Safari in Singapore,5.0,,"It was wonderful experience in Night Safari, Kids were enjoyed the adventurers. I would advise people to try street walk (ups and down) instead of Tram Raid. :-)"
,,Kept in the dark,3.0,,Massive amount of people waiting to get in. I had e tickets so skipped most of the queues. We didn't see any park maps went on the tram ride which was good. Later you are supposed to follow 4 different trails but it was super hard to work out where you were. More signage required! And clear maps. Overall an interesting experience. Taxi scammers outside tried to offer $$$$ rides into town but we did it for free via Tour Singapore tourist Pass.
,,Very Disappointed,1.0,,Not worth the money spent. Very few animals. Also all animals that is normally seen in any zoo in India. Nothing special. Not worth it
,,This is a must,5.0,,We went on this trip around the zoo at night and it was awesome. To see the animals right beside you is really cool. I recommend doing this as late as possible as the crowds are less and the night is cooler.
,,Delight for kids,4.0,,"Great sites, well maintained and educational. Need lesser wait times and some sitting for those in queue."
,,Disappointed by a long-time favorite,2.0,,"We expected visiting the Night Safari to be a highlight of a family reunion in Singapore. We had many delightful visits 1998-2006. We were disappointed at the end of 2017. Tickets purchased weeks in advance resulted in a 45-minute wait to be admitted to be told that it would be another 45-60 minutes to board the tram. We set off on a the crowded walking trails to discover that you could no longer board the tram at other stations. It wasn't possible to see the show because of the crowds. With no reasonable access to the tram, we missed much of the park.
Lesson learned: Don't go to the Night Safari during the holiday season. They don't limit number of people there. The time on your ticket means little. As we entered close to 10 pm, the PA announcement said they were admitting people with 7:15, 8:15 and 9:15 tickets. Frankly, there was no sign the park was focused on visitor enjoyment at any time.
For years I have told visitors to Singapore that the Night Safari is a must-see attraction. No more."
,,Busy night in night safari,3.0,,"We went to night safari together with my family and my parents. We came when the park opened and first took the train. We got to see a lot of animals. After the train trip we walked around the park. This would have been nicer with less people. There were a lot of noise coming from the show so it really didn't feel like we were there in the woods alone....
I would not come back."
,,Disappointing,1.0,,We were disappointed in the night safari as a lot of the animals were not around to be seen. I think there are too many people on the trams and this makes it difficult to see animals if you are on one side and they are on the other. Perhaps only 3to a row would be better. Too much waiting around for things to open as well
,,Nighttime Fun,5.0,,"Interesting and unique way to see the zoo, loved it. Buy tickets online so that you get the entrance time you want. We did a combo tour with a daytime visit to the zoo."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"We purchased A Singapore pass which was great as we got into Universal Studios, Hop on Hop Off Bus, Night Safari, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and A City Tour. Night Safari was very enjoyable. We made our own way there it’s quite a distance from the city but very simple. We were lucky that it wasn’t very busy so didn’t have long to wait for our tram. Lovely to see the animals up close. We then did a walk which was also good."
,,Fun Night,4.0,,Getting to see the animals when they were relaxed and out and about at night when it was cooler was wonderful! It was too dark to take pictures but you could clearly see them. My only complaint was it was too crowded. We opted for the 8.15pm visit and the park was FULL! Next time I would try the last viewing perhaps there would be less people. We caught a taxi from VivoCity and it cost $30 each way!
,,Nature at night time.,5.0,,"We went on the night safari and loved the experience. Much cooler than during the day. Tram ride was interesting and we saw many animals not seen in daylight. The trail walk was wonderful and it seemed we could almost touch some of the creatures,"
,,The animals are great,4.0,,We saw a lot of unusual tropical animals that were fascinating. The animals are well lit so you can see them. They have done a terrific job at keeping the mosquitoes away as despite being in the bush at night there are no mosquitoes. Transport is easy to and from the zoo.
,,Thrilling ride,4.0,,The beautiful ride through the rain forest on the tram takes us through a variety of wildlife. It is set in their natural habitat. The show was neat. The kids had a wonderful time.
,,Do the Combo with the Twilight Tour,5.0,,"My wife loves the zoo. So did the daytime visit and atay there till it got dark and went on for the Twilight session. That was a great idea! Those are two totally separated parts of the zoo.
The daytime version is a standard version of a zoo. The monkeys have a great “free range” compound. Lots of trees connected. Otherwise this part is okay (3.5 out of 5).
Then we spend some time in the restaurant till our ticket for the nighttime part was due. Can‘t remember the name of the place, but the is not much to choose from and it was okay, big buffet with a okay selection (3 out of 5).
But the best part of our trip to the zoo was the Twilight part! You can see all the nocturnal animals! That was really great! Can really recommend to do that part! By the way you don‘t have to wait till your booked time on the ticket (or maybe only when it is very crowded)."
,,Different experience of zoo,4.0,,Totally a different experience to see animals at night Everything is planned so perfectly that u feel real time forest feel with security My children enjoyed it
,,something different!,4.0,,"Much more animal activity to witness during the night than daytime. Well worth visiting, especially with young children."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Firstly the tickets are time restricted, so whilst we arrived at 7.30pm when the zoo opened, our tickets did not allow us in till 8.15pm.

Then we queued for about 30mins to get on a tram, where we were persistently told to be quiet, yet a loud commentary was pretty continuous throughout.

Amazingly we saw every animal that the automated commentary said we would, leading us to question exactly how the animals were so well placed! It all seemed very false and manipulated.

The walking paths were better and it was cool to get close to the wallabies.

I was here many years ago and had good memories, but I would not visit again. I think it's become overly commercialised and I did not enjoy it this time."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Raining when we went but still saw everything. Took the train ride around the park. Saw many animals and the information provided on the train was very informative. There are tracks you can walk on your own but you would need umbrellas if wet. Tracks were well supervised. The food outlets are very good and reasonably priced. There is a wildlife show afterwards but due to the wet weather it was not on as it is in the open. Great for kids.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,The Night safari is a really great experience with lots of great food stalls. Make sure you book prior the trolley/tram is a fun experience for the kids and seeing the animals at night is very exciting.
,,Night Safari Fantastic,5.0,,Although it was raining our trip to the Night Safari was something special. Especially the kids would love it. The food outlets there are very good and reasonably priced. The train ride is very informative and there were plenty of animals to see. Because it was raining the vegetation glistened in the light and was even more beautiful than if it was not wet. The weather didn't seem to worry the animals as they were all visible. The setup of the course was incredible as the animals can wander across the tracks. Didn't get to see the show afterwards because of the weather as it is in the open. We only rode the train ride but one can walk tracks through the area which look quite easy and well supervised.
,,Maybe with small children,3.0,,"The zoo by its self is nice, interactive and clean. There is a restaurant and plenty of services offered. The nighttime safari promises more than it delivers.
One can ride a tram inside the safari and see the animals at night.
I think the price was a little high for the experience and definitely not a must."
,,Not a must,3.0,,"We did the night safari, I think it promised more than it could deliver. Nice zoo, not sure if we would repeat it again. Maybe if you have young children. Not recommended for families with teenagers. Was overpriced for the experience."
,,Garbage,1.0,,"Went this at 19.15 and it was raining and then got stormy so they cancelled a show we wanted to see for safety to customers as well as the animals which is fair enough we understand that. However, the decision to cancel came very late and now the next entry time for people to come in merged with us so it was pandemonium. We then wanted to walk some of the trails again for safety reasons we were not allowed ok We understand that too however, there were just too many people in the place. Queues for the only thing we were allowed to do ie the trams was just enormous we were queuing for well over an hour and getting nowhere it was pandemonium with no control whatsoever except staff telling us what we couldn't do. In the end after nearly 3 hours of doing and seeing NOTHING we left. Safety to customers and animals is perfectly understood but this place on the night we went was just crazy with many unhappy people. Not sure they voiced their opinions but we certainly did, in a calm manner of course. Very very disappointed and the worst thing we did (or rather attempted to do) in Singapore. Garbage avoid if it's raining."
,,Variety of animals,5.0,,This is very nice experience to see wild animals just from few feet’s distance from you. They have good facility of transportation.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Was an awesome night out with the family.
Well organized, but you need to be very quick if you want to get into the shows as they fill up very quick.

Very humid on the night we went so dress appropriately.

Steer clear of any large noisy groups of people with young kids if you want to see and hear the animals, especially the timid ones.

We used Grab to get in and back which was like $20 each way but so easy."
,,It’s a place you must visit in singapore,5.0,,The best night safari I ever been to. Big zoo with lots of animal to see. The tram ride is the USP must go by it. It gives you a closer look of all the animals. This place can be very crowded during holiday season.
,,Loved the experience!,4.0,,"I recommend taking the 9.15pm time slot, and then first walking around the whole place. It does not take long. After that, once the crowd has finished fighting their way onto all the trams, then the trams are free, and it is much easier to get a tram ride as well. Both methods are highly recommended!!"
,,Safari by night,5.0,,"The night safari which is part of the Singapore Zoo area is a must visit. We had a great experience and enjoyed the attraction to the fullest. The animals are out for the most part and the pathways are well made and lit in such a way to create a mood that enhances the experience.

I believe that we chose the best time to visit and see the entire park. We chose the 9.15pm session where you can enter any time after that time. At 9.00pm there is a show of dancers with fire which is phenomenal. After which we entered the park and went straight to 'The creatures of the night' show which starts at 9.30pm. Once that is over make a move through the park starting at the Fishing Cat Trail. This loops through the entire park. We then caught the last tram which departs at 11.15pm to go around the park which concludes in about 30 to 40 minutes.

This schedule worked out well for us and I would recommend it for anyone to go through the park.

Remember to always turn the flash off when you are taking photos. Respect the animals and their habitats. - Thank you!"
,,An Christmas Eve in Night Safari,4.0,,"This is my second visit to Night safari after more then 10 years. But this time I come back with my three children and it is Christmas Eve,.... meaning lots and lots and lots of people

During my arrival, me and my kids are greatly and warmly assist by one of the staff, Yunnis!!!!!!!. She is very very helpful and caring.... and my children all said she look like Camilia Caballo. Without her help, my visit will be quite challenging especially in the heavy crowd

The tram experience is still great as many years ago,... kids are enjoying the excitement of the view.

And continue with the trail walk it is a good walk with surprise of seeing animal which you will not able to see it with tram

One white lion missing thought

Small suggestion to the management , please put the bar higher for bridge over the river reside by the big crocodile... I worry parent who carry hyper active kid may accident fall into the crocodile river

The night show is fun, although it is not spectacular. But it is a entertaining yet warm feeling for me and family to spend our Christmas Eve"
,,Explore the world of animals!,5.0,,"Get on a tram and explore the world of animals through the night light. I loved my time here watching animals and reading about them on the boards, even though I am not an animal person."
,,Pretty good evening.,4.0,,"We spent the day at the zoo and finished it off with the Night Safari. I will put in some tips. If you go when it opens, head straight for the creatures of the night show. Don’t line up for a tram as the crowds are too large. Get a tram after the show.
There are four walking trails with lots of beautiful animals to see. There is enough lighting in the park so the trails are not dangerous. The tram ride is pretty good and they did slow down so the passengers could get a nice view.
You don’t have to be there at 7:15. You could do the park in three hours, therefore, you could leave it for a bit and get there after the crowd has spread out. There are a lot of people lining up at the start and it is quite crowded, so go to the show first.
Unfortunately there will be times where visitors will have a poor attitude. Other visitors and staff don’t have to put up with that.
Another tip: please put you bags on the floor of the tram, by your feet and not on the seats. That way more people can get on the tram."
,,Good fun!,4.0,,"It was definitely great to go at night to the zoo for a change! We had a very chatty group so it was hard to hear what the tour guide at the front was saying even with the speakers. I had to even tell them to hush at one point - so I recommend that the tour guides emphasize *not talking* during the ride. Even though the animals were not that active, it was such a relaxing ride and so much fun to see these animals at night! Absolutely beautiful night with serene animals. The elephants were stunning and I loved how close a couple of the animals got. Definitely recommend, even though you may not see the animals too well/up close. Go for the experience!"
,,A nice experience but beware of the crowds,3.0,,"Our family 2 x adults and 2 x children (12 and 10) really enjoyed the experience of a zoo at night. Our tip would be to eat early (restaurants are not great) and turn up early, like 2 hours so you can book the 7.15 tram. Otherwise you will have to wait for the 8.15 or 9.15 and your entry is on these times also. Other tip is to get the express tram, otherwise you will be also waiting for a while."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Highlight of a visit to Singapore. World class Zoo. Makes visiting any other zoo around the world a second rate experience. The Night Safari allows you to get close to a host of nocturnal animals including the big 5 from Africa.
,,night safari,5.0,,"amazing collection of animals. lions, hyenas all move around the tram. exquisite view. a must visit. it is a great effort on the park staff to keep the endangered species alive and thriving."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"A unique experience to visit a zoo at night. Not without draw backs. We purchased the tickets in the Chinatown information, which we received a piece of paper, stating we had the tickets and paid. This changed when we got there, we had to Q to get actual tickets, this was 40 minutes at least. Then we went for the safari train, this involved another long Q, not good. Once on the train the trip around the park was good, except some of the animals must have been tucked up in bed. After the train trip is complete you can walk various trails, certainly different at night with the animals very close.
There is a various amount of food stalls, all looked ok, but we didn’t try any, because we were getting late for the coach home. I would get the night safari bus from your hotel, excellent value at $11 per person return. Last return coach at 23.00."
,,Overhyped and boring,2.0,,"They allow too many at the same time resulting in chaos. Most of the staff also looked or seemed clueless coz of the rush unlike in other parks.Tram ride was very boring and not worth the money. Coz of the crowd we decided to skip the creature of the night show. Having bought the park hobber plus ticket, I think we should have be given priority to enter the show."
,,Different but not worth it,3.0,,"It a very different experience but most of animals are not nocturnal so either that are asleep or too dark to see. If you decide to go, make sure that you book for the 7:15pm session as they become quite busy so they limit number of people to enter the park per hour, but if you can enter the park you still can stay until close which is 12:00am. Make sure to bring insect repellents as there is lots of mosquitoes"
,,Not good,2.0,,"I visited Night safari with my family who are seniors. They expected many kinds of animals in the safari, but there are so less species.It was so disappointed!"
,,"Poorly managed - all hype, not worth it",2.0,,"With so many years of experience of running Night Safari, we were quite let down by the way it was managed - quite chaotic. It is surprising that they are not using their experience to improve the experience for the visitors.

It starts right at the entrance - preference is given to those who have group bookings - they don't wait in the Q but walk in at their convenience. We bought our tickets directly and had to stand in the Q for almost 45 minutes. The management should understand that non-group booking people also contribute to their profits.

There is one Q for checking the tickets. As you are going in, you are made to wait another 30 minutes. And there is no seating - you are just standing there in multiple lines, while watching the Group booking people stroll in. And finally, there is another wait in Q for scanning your tickets and entering the area. Once you are in, there is another long Q for the tram ride. And it is frustrating as all those group booking people are again ahead of you in the tram Q. We realised that the staff there is more interested in keeping tour operators happy rather than those who come directly / do their own planning.

We went to see Creatures of the Night - a pathetic show put on by the staff. Please don't waste you time on it.

Please factor in another 30 minutes wait before you can board the tram. It was again poorly managed as we saw many trams leaving with empty seats - surprising as there was a long Q. And in many seats, we saw just a couple sitting where as the capacity of a row is 4 people - they could easily fit in 2 couples each and clear the Q faster.

After the tram ride, we did the walk around. We could hardly see any additional animals on the walk around - we saw most of them on the tram ride.

There are 4 walks - sequential - Fishing Cat Trail; Leopard Trail; East Lodge Trail and Wallaby Trail. At the end of the the Leopard Trail, you have the option to board a Tram and return to the starting point."
,,Wet Night!!,4.0,,Poured all day long but we had tickets for the Night Safari. Luckily I had read previous reviews of the queues so we decided to arrive an hour earlier at 6pm even though we had booked online. No queues at ticket machines- but staff unhelpful as to where to queue to board the tram. Lines quickly built up but phew we were eventually directed to the front of a line. Rain still falling heavily but on board we were ok. Lots of animals to see which were almost ‘staged’. At one point we were driving through a river of rain water. After we were told that the amazing animal show was cancelled and as that was ‘complimentary’ we couldn’t come back!! We decided to follow the trails in torrential rain. Animals were being fed which added to our excitement. All in all I would recommend but preferred the day zoo!
,,A great way to see the nocturnal zoo inhabitants,5.0,,"The night safari is a well organised excursion. My husband and I have experienced the real thing in Africa, but we took our son and daughter on this trip so they could get a feel...and they loved it!
The actual 'safari' takes place on a tram and queuing does not take too long. You are shown a good selection of animals and can see them at close quarters. The darkness does mean that the size of the enclosures, which is a bonus...this is a zoo after all. Remember to do the walking trails after the tram ride as an even greater selection of animals are on offer, including a fruit bat enclosure you can enter.
A good evening adventure!"
,,Terrible experience to avoid at all costs,1.0,,"I never complain about/review any of my travel experiences however tonight has been one of the BIGGEST WASTES OF TIME of my life. Don't be fooled by the good reviews I'm not kidding you. After traveling a half hour to the zoo at 7 we were told that the 7:15 and 8:15 tours were sold out; we were assured by the ticket workers that we would be able to get a seat on the tram after 9:15 when we got in so we bought the tickets for this tour. However, after lining up for 2 hours for the first queue TO JUST GET OUR TICKETS CHECKED, it was another HOUR wait in the line to get on the trams. Can't forget the part where we had a whole family of 20 people push in front of us because one of their family members was waiting in front and the workers did absolutely nothing and let them straight through in front of everyone waiting in line. We opted to go on the walking tracks first then to come back later when the tram line wasn't as long. Coming back from the trail at 10, there was still a 200m line to get on the trams (basically still an hour's wait). Walking past that line, there was yet another 300m line of the people who had bought their tickets for the 10:15 tour who were still waiting to get their tickets checked before they would have to wait with the people still waiting for the tram since 9:15. Furthermore, to anyone considering going on a busy night where you won't be able to get a seat on the tram, the walking tracks are actually not well-lit at all. You can barely see any of the animals in the dark, half are sleeping or just aren't even there. Literally just paying $45 a ticket to look at bloody trees in the dark and to suffer in the heat surrounded by hundreds of people in line for hours. I understand that it's peak season and it gets busy; however it's just not ethical to keep selling tickets to the point where it's overcrowded and there is no way you will be able to cater for everyone who has already bought a ticket for the sole purpose of getting to go on the tram tour without even WARNING them that they might not even be able to make it, because this is something I would've liked to know before my whole family bought the tickets at 7. It's not the money so much as the principle here that they are selling tickets for monetary gain without warning customers of the downright ridiculous wait times after the whole place is packed shoulder to shoulder and there aren't enough trams to put people on PLUS the misinformation we received from various workers. Just writing this as a caution to anyone thinking of going that this is what it could be like if you happened to go on a busy night (not sure how busy other nights are). Waste of money and time but that's just my two cents.
If you need any more proof of this go onto their facebook page and read the recent reviews on there as well."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Incredible content of animals, well presentation and good treatment to the animals. Well organized with hundreds of staff. They can manage the crowd professionally. Therefore, the queues are really fast. I recommend to invest 4 hours and visit all attractions."
,,Fun Adventure,4.0,,Not much to say other than this is a good place to visit on a quick stopover in Singapore. It is quite fun just going on a safari cart type vehicle looking at all the nocturnal animals which seem quite free to roam and so on... definitely worth a visit...
,,Must see,5.0,,My wife and I went to the zoo for the night tour very informative tour well worth the visit plenty of food to eat at the restaurants definitely recommend this tour
,,Memorable trip,5.0,,"We had a long day visiting the zoo from morning n the river safari and also the river cruise. Actually we were tired but also took up the night safari. We were inside the venue at about 6 45 pm. We were guided to the place of start of trams. It is a guided tour with explanations of the animals around. It is a big adventure like in the forest which is dark n dimly lit. It takes around 40 minuets ride n we were back , then we had good vegetarian dinner n started back inside again on a walk trail which takes us to the natural habitat with the lions roaring tigers walking n other wild animals in the vicinity , which make u feel so happy. We had a good one hour walk n enjoyed so well. We came back round midnight to a taxi stand to welcome us back home"
,,Good night out but definitely go with tour group,4.0,,"This was a pretty good experience we booked with a tour group. This was totally worth it. Picked up from hotel, taken to transfer station and then transferred to coach which took us to the park. Honestly the park was mayhem... but with the tour everything is under control. I think we had a wait time if 10 mins for tram where normally lines were up to 2 hours. After the tour you have about an hour or so before bus heads back do we did the walking tours which were lovely and got to see different animals up close. The timeline was perfect out from 6-11ish which is quite late for families with young kids. The only downside is coming back the bus stops and drops at each hotel. Just need to be prepared for that, they make it as smooth as possible. Overall a different type of experience."
,,Fun 60-90 mins,4.0,,"Enjoyable evening out with kids. Well organised, see parts of zoo otherwise unavailable, kept kids engaged and was a good length of time for youngsters. Stopped as they were getting bored. Waiting time was quite long Even though there seemed to be lots of empty ‘stations’."
,,Crowded and they use Fake animals,2.0,,"I paid S$120,— for 2 adults and one Child! Its ok because Singapore is an expansive Town. I bought the Tickets online. So you do Not have to stand in a crowed for Büdingen Tickets.but you have to stand in the Crowd for waiting for the Train for about ohne hour! That this is horrible with Kids. When the Train Starts, you sit with someone Noisy indians in the Train.you can Not Listen to animals or something like that.

The Train is so fast, that you can Not See the animals really good. BUT YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE PEFECT POSITIONED ANIMALS LIKE A LION, A HYPO AND AN ELEFANT, BUT SUPRISE SUPRISE THAT HAVE BEEN FAKE ANIMALS. NO REAL ANIMALS!!!

For that Money I want to See real animals! My son said to me, why the Elefant on the right did everytime the same positions. Now I Tell ihm why.

We go there for the Kids. I would go there Never again.

It would Be fair if the Management would outed that Same animlals are Faktes!"
,,Pretty disappointing,2.0,,"It was so crowded that the wait for the tram was miles long, so long in fact that it was impossible to get on. The walking trails are not well identified and while I know it is a zoo and seeing animals is actually a bit of lottery. The fact that you pay a good deal to go is in no way enhanced by empty enclosures. Be careful if you use MTR and busses the express back to the MTR station stops at 7:00 and when we tried to get a cab back to the station he can driver dropped us at a completely different place, so the MTR trip took 25 minutes longer all for the sake of him being sneaky and taking us farther than we needed to go, all he was interested in was driving us back to the city."
,,Average,3.0,,"Went during the afternoon, which was way more entertaining compared to the night safari. Couldn’t see all the animals as clearly and confined to the tram at night."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"As the name suggests this Safari is done at night.
they take you into the dense jungles in an open train where you get to see a huge variety of wild animals up there in the open.
the novel experience here is that you are open and so are the animals
in spite of their wild nature none of them dares to leave their open enclosures or wander into the enclosures of other animals to grab a fast bite.
a lot of training or maybe sedation or maybe electrical fencing God knows, but altogether it is a thrilling experience.
worth a visit.
there is also a show of small animals that are trained and tutored to impress but somehow that did not do much wonders."
,,Only for kids,1.0,,It doesn' t worth it. It is only nice for kids. You can' t see the animals in the dark. Too expencive for 30' in the train and nothing you see. For kids maybe its perfect.
,,Great for family,5.0,,"Our family had a wonderful time at the night safari. Many of the animals are awake and surprisingly close. It does make for a long day though. We arrived at 7:30 PM and left after 11 PM, so the kids were really tired by the end. However, it was such a cool experience they did little to no complaining."
,,Unique and Inteesting,4.0,,"Best to do this as part of a tour which will allow easier entrance and tram access. But if you combine with the earlier River Safari this is an extremely long day, not advised for families with children. Suggest skip the River Safari and do only the Night Safari which is more informative and interesting due to its unique nature."
,,An awesome evening,5.0,,The highlight of the Singapore Zoo is the night safari. The ride through the tropical rainforest watching the nocturnal animals was a treat to the eyes. Missed the animal show as I had to wait more than an hour as it was full 😰
,,Animals ok. Queues an utter nightmare.,2.0,,"Pre purchased tickets, only to arrive and have to line up for 45 minutes to get tickets validated. Arrived for 715 safari and all sold out until 915pm. Then had to queue for another 45mins to get in and then 45mins for a tram. Kids were asleep when we finally saw animals. The train went for 30 mins and we left for the hotel. A few good animals like tigers and rhinos, most hard to spot. Excessive amount of deer. Takes an hour or more to get here. Not at all worth $160 for family tickets and travel. So disappointed."
,,Different experience!,5.0,,A whole new experience that is different from the zoo or river safari. It was really crowded at the start where almost all would queue for the tram ride first. I would recommend exploring on foot first as there are four amazing walking trails. After the walk is when the crowd dies a little and thus shorter waiting time for the tram ride. I love the free range zones!
,,Night Safari in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the best experience is watching the animals at night time. They have one show called ""Amphibians etc"" which is very crowded & hyped too. But i didn't felt it is so exciting. Rather the shows in Zoo (Day time) was so good especially with sea lion & elephants. They are too good.

Coming to Night safari, first take the Tram and see cover most of the places in an hour. White lion is the highlight. After tram, you must walk to at-least certain portions to feel that forest atmosphere. It will be so good to walk in between dark trees with animals suddenly popping out. So good. Don't miss it by just taking Tram.

People are so friendly and supportive. You can take their help at any time. Food is bit costly. So it is better, if you bring your own snacks & drinks. This will save some grans."
,,We had lots of fun!,4.0,,Me and my friends went on a weekend and we managed to see all the animals in the enclosures! It was an awesome experience and the trainers there were really helpful in explaining the animal's diet and such. Thumbs up! :)
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Well managed, clean beautiful place to see some real wildlife... We sighted lots f animals. Must recommended place to visit. And there welcome animal show is treat to the eyes..."
,,Average,3.0,,"Main interest: U can see Animal in your near, That is the main interest, All are at Average experience, Entrance fee 35 Dollar,"
,,Unique experience,5.0,,We arrived at 7pm and queues up for the 7:30pm tram ride straight away. It is very crowded and strongly advised for future visitors to arrive earlier and be prepared for a half an hour queue for the tram ride during peak season. Took a taxi from Chinatown to night safari and it costs me SGD $32 but it only costs me $21 back to Bugis. There was a vehicle broken down on the way there causing a bit of traffic jam but I still felt like a rip off. Worthwhile to ask the taxi driver for an estimate even though they switch on the meter.
,,An enlightening experience - well worth the effort,5.0,,"This safari is an excellent way of seeing animals in their "" natural"" habitat. A lot of work has gone into creating the experience and the opportunity to see nocturnal animals you might otherwise never see.
We followed the ride with a walk along some of the trails that cover the same territory but which give you a different perspective and allow access to displays not otherwise accessible. Highly recommended.
The range of animals is impressive considering the constraints applied by the area available."
,,Great fun for all ages,5.0,,Get your tix in advance online. Easy Uber ride from downtown. All the shows were entertaining and the evening was wonderful! The free tram gives you a pleasant ride to see the animals that you can get close to on foot. Don't miss this!
,,Night Safari Singapore - Awesome!,5.0,,"I went to Night Safari Singapore with my family and one word sums it all, awesome! As a local, i was amused by the place and show event. I am sure tourists would love it too. My best advice, if possible, do enter on their given earliest timing for the evening. So you would not miss out on the show times. Do remember you need some time for the walkabout. If you adventure late, the diners there might be closed when you are about to exit. You will sure go hungry. Plus if you end late, there might not be buses available out. Finally, it is handy to get their map. Enjoy!"
,,Don’t miss the Night Safari,5.0,,"We are big fans of the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari. Our family of four loved this and we throughly recommend visiting. You first are ushered into a show, then onto a tram. Most people seem to leave at that point. However we stayed and walked through all of the trails. that was by far the best part - so much to see and explore. It felt like we were the only ones there. I can see how this would be a welcome activity when it’s really hot too."
,,A victim of its own success,2.0,,"This was the second time I have visited the night safari, and it was a disappointment compared to my first trip. We were given a 19:15 time to arrive and joined a huge, badly managed queue with people leaving the roped area to push back in. After over 30 minutes we got on the vehicle for the trip with a number of very young children who cried sporadically during the safari, they were too young to understand what was happening, and possibly tired. Throughout the 30 minute ride passengers were taking flash photos with their phones, which ruined night vision for a few minutes after each photo, it also affected the animals we were trying not to disturb. The walking part of the safari was far more enjoyable as it was much quieter. The animals were well presented and there were staff about to guide and answer questions. Had I not been before I might have been more positive, but the long queues and behaviour of certain individuals on the Night Safari meant I did not enjoy this experience as much as I expected to, and it would not be at the top of a list of things I would recommend to people visiting Singapore."
,,You can skip this activity if you have watched a wild life TV program once in your life!,1.0,,"Apart from organization and arrangment which was very well at Singaporian style, this activity has no value just waste of time and money. You well get to trains passing the zoo at dark on asfalt passways and see few animals from long distance in darkness. Many mamals from deer types, lions and tigers are sleeping and does the other. If you are really keen to show animals to kid then better to pay for normal admission to the zoo at day time."
,,Visit on 9 Dec 2017,5.0,,"Had a great experience. Staff were friendly. Would be good if they could let us know online, which enclosures/animals won't be available for viewing on that day."
,,Great ...never b4,5.0,,Gr8 show....nxt to the zoo..even though crowded..the tram ride line moved super efficiently and fast...recommended for all
,,Good but overrated,3.0,,"We thought it was pretty cool but overall it was overrated. Maybe we are spoiled because we live near sea world and Universal Studios, but the animal so was not too special. The animals at night we’re cool but I think it would actually be better by day when you can actually see. It appeared that it might be an excellent day times zoo if you can handle the heat. If you only have a few days in Singapore, I would not put this at the top of the list. Also the food was fairly expensive. Since you have to arrive so early, you sort of get stuck eating there."
,,Night Zoo,3.0,,Got here around 8pm. You can’t get to the zoo by MRT and have to take a taxi. This will cost around $20 from the CBD. It was so crowded upon arrival and we had to queue just to get in. We explored on foot first. Some of the animals were somewhat elusive! We then took the tram tour which had comprehensive and detailed commentary. This part was good. We spent about 2 hours here and could have probably spent more but it was far too busy. The lion feeding was under-whelming. We didn’t get to see the shows as they were already booked out so that was disappointing. I think the day zoo may have been a better option but we had wanted to try something different.
,,Love it,5.0,,"Only issue is some people still don’t respect the rules and use flashes while taking photos, some actions should be taken as one dear got a bit irritated and kids were scared from its reaction
Other than that great visit and lovely for adults and kids"
,,Worst staff at night show... poor management,1.0,,8.30 show approach fully taken up and 9.30 show available. The only way to watch these is by queueing in from 8.30. Paid so much money but only have time to get to a tram ride and a night show. It's a scam with their management skill. Very little time to go for a trail. We are forced to choose between a show or night trail or come again paying for the tickets agains. Worst is it's so crowded with people in the queue and staff keeps pushing us to stick to each other. We are sweating and when we complained not to push us any closer she shouted back saying there is a lot of fan to keep us cool. But we are an hour away for the show to start and I don't understand why she wants us to stand so close to each other. Need smart people to work at this place. Have small kids fainting in the line without enough oxygen
,,OverPrice,3.0,,"You pay aroun 40 SGD for less than an hour in a car that covers all the zoo, you can see animals in movement but just as you might see them during day. the zoo is no so big, and you can also walk throug it. take photos is almost imposible cuse is dark."
,,Worth the trip,4.0,,"We went on a weeknight and aimed to arrive for the 7:15pm timeslot but underestimated the travel time. Traffic was slow heading out of town and the taxi fare was expensive at $55. Fortunately we shared with another couple who were also going to the zoo and were in the taxi queue next to us. We'd bought our tickets online so we went straight in and didn't have to wait long for the tram. During the tram ride we were able to see many of the animals even though it was quite dark, so don't expect brightly illuminated enclosures as the animals' comfort rightly has the priority. We ate dinner there after the tram ride and the quality and serving size was good from our chosen outlet. After that we walked on some of the other trails. Again, we were able to see most of the animals and even closer than the tram. For example, the wallaby trail allows you to see them up close. Also you might get another chance to see some of animals you missed on the tram. We saw the rhinos happily munching away from the trail yet when we went past on the tram earlier they were mostly submerged. Also a few times we heard the lion roaring in the distance as we walked the trails. I anticipated swarms of mosquitoes and other biting insects but was pleasantly surprised. Getting back home was faster and cheaper because we were offered a $6 per person bus trip back to town at a drop off point very close to our hotel. The only downside was having to wait about 20 minutes for the bus to depart. I'd say you would enjoy the night safari more if you made it a separate zoo trip rather than going after a long day of other outdoor activities or being at the zoo already during the day."
,,The best experience,5.0,,I was a little bit skeptisch at first if my son would appreciate it since its already late for his age. But to my surprise its the best experience that we had from our Singapore vacation. With how they took care of the Animals are really bravo. The animals not squeezed in a cage but can freely walk like in a wild. I really appreciate the efforts of the whole staff on maintaning the place and taking care of the animals.
,,Could have been better,2.0,,It was dark and we are expecting a full experirnce of showtimes as we realised it was a short one. Didnt get to experience much as the tram activity for sight-seeing closer to animals are pretty short too. Maybe there are other activities which we are not aware. Eateries not many choices for Muslim. Hope they can cater more in future.
,,Another view of animal,5.0,,Really good parc as we can see animal during night time. The walking road are also really great and you can enter into the wallabies cage :D.
,,Good Night,5.0,,"We visited the park twice, the first time was after a day out at the zoo - which was mistake as our little one was pretty much beat & slept throughout the tram ride later. Though we did squeeze in the Creatures of the Night show & a walkabout on the trails.

Went back a second time & this time our little girl thoroughly enjoyed the sights & sounds!

It's probably the closest you can get to some of the park's residents being a safari adventure & all. If you've not been there, go at least once cos it is a real treat...

& makes up for a good night's sleep after.

Kudos to the staff for being an amazing bunch. Not so for some fellow visitors who despite being politely reminded, still chose to use flash photography. Goes to show that even animals, can at times, be better at listening."
,,Disappointing Experience,2.0,,"As birthday gift for my daughter's 18th, my friend gave my family 3 tickets for 17th Dec. We planned excitedly for the tram ride and to get off/walk along the trails. We took the tram at the main station at around 8pm (our photo in the tram queue shows the time). It was extremely disappointing the tram did not stop at any trail at all. This is not what website promises."
,,Queu-te,2.0,,"Ye gods it's a mission to get out there from central Singapore in time for the session times. Once there, tickets bought, you've probably missed the 7:30pm show queue opportunity (we did) so we split forces: mum joined the queue for the 8:30pm show (at 7:40...) while the rest of us ran (yes ran) the paths in order to try to see some shadows that apparently were leopards, hyenas and other animals in time to get back to see the show. Which we just did. Just! But it was a shame to have to divide up to do so. The show was quite good, and worth a look. In all, it seems that this is a victim of its own success: lots of people want to go, so the queues are mighty, but the animals are very hard to see in their enclosures. Best bit of the night for me? Getting a cab back to our hotel and the driver taking us down Orchard Road to look at the Xmas lights on the way..."
,,Just LOVED it!,5.0,,The Sweetest people work here! They bend over backwards to help. They are enthusiastic and kind. The commentary on the safari is intelligent and interesting. The animals are AMAING. It is hard to believe you are so close. It is quiet and peaceful. A beautiful experience. Thank you. I thoroughly recommend it.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Awesome experience with much great enhancement since my last visit years ago...totally love the up close tram ride with the animals such as the tapir. Great outing.
,,Not a great attraction,3.0,,"The attraction by itself is a well structured and neatly carried out activity. Some of the animals were worth seeing as they were active in the night.

But, this attraction is definitely not meant for children below 3 years old. My son is 2 years old and he could not see most of the animals. The waiting time in the queue was about an hour.

This attraction would be more fun if the seats/participants per day was limited."
,,Interesting But Short Duration,4.0,,"It's a unique experience to get so close with wild animals. Many exhibits are interesting to watch. However, the operating hours are too short to properly enjoy thoroughly. Also, it would be nice if there were public transportation that coincide with Night Safari's closing time."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,Loved the night Zoo. Did the tram ride at dusk and again later in the night and saw the different animals active at the different times. Hot tip- if you wait and stand quietly at the exhibits some of the more timid animals will come out and reward your patience
,,Not exciting at all,2.0,,I have found this place really overrated . The animal show was very average and zoo also did not have anything different to offer
,,The Perfect Adventure,5.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari is a treat - every time!
There is something very special about visiting the zoo at night, which is difficult to explain so I can only recommend everyone to go and experience it for themselves. I would call it the perfect attraction for visitors of all ages.
Piece of advice: I have visited twice now, once on a Friday or Saturday night and once during the week. It was considerably less busy during the week so if you have the choice, try to avoid weekends."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,Very nice experience to see the animals at night.. Tram ride is definite try where you see deers and few other animals very near to you. Animals are active at night so would suggest to visit this.. People talk a lot in tram which is most annoying.. There must be some control on it.
,,Great exhibit,5.0,,Really enjoyed this. Tip don't queue up for the tram as you get in. Go for a walk around and see the exhibits you can see on foot first. Then go on the tram as by this time the crowds have dispersed and you are wasting time queuing.
,,Nice place but not worth the money paid.. 45 S$ is too much for a zoo.. Nothing extra ordinary..,1.0,,Nice place but not worth the money paid.. 45 S$ is too much for a zoo.. Nothing extra ordinary......
,,Exotic,4.0,,A wonderful way to see the nocturnal diversity of tropical rainforests. You ride on a tram that takes you on a guided tour of the night safari.
,,Must see,5.0,,Had an excellent time at the safari. It is very well maintained and very enjoyable. The premises are clean and the guards are very friendly and dedicated.
,,Animal Show or Talk Show?,3.0,,The entertainment by the emcee of night creature show seems to overshadow the animals. I heard my relatives saying that the show years ago was more exciting.
,,Fun night!,4.0,,"A great experience as it’s so different to other previously visited zoos. The tram ride around is informative and good to view most of the animals, but take the opportunity to walk around the pathways as you continue to see more animals in an exciting setting as you explore in the dark. Along the route there are lots of interesting facts, and in a few sections you can go into the cage area, such as to see the fruit bats.
Great fun for adults and children."
,,Night activity,5.0,,Well... i love the place and not hot cause it at night.. we can see many kind of animals at there even some its different from the zoo.
,,Not great in the wet weather.,3.0,,"We booked and paid for a tour via our hotel. Once there, we had 30 mins or so to wander around the shops and eatery before our Tram slot. Once on the tram, it took us on a winding tour throughout the park. The thunderstorm eased off to a drizzle, but it was still very hard to spot many of the animals. The tram tour was over in about 40 mins, then as the animal shows were cancelled because of the rain, our guide (Grayson) showed us the trails we could walk, as we had time to waste before the bus left 90mins later. The final animal show went ahead, which we enjoyed, the host was lovely and the animals very cute. It was an educational show. The sour point of our night was being abandoned by our tour bus as the animal show ran late and they didn't wait. If that happens to you, there is a shuttle bus outside that you can catch back to near your hotel for $6 each. On a dry, clear night, I think the Night Safari would be great for children."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"a unique safari at night. having special experience to see the animals during the night. The tram ride was so enjoyable. We able to be so close with the animal. The tour guide were so friendly and made the journey so relax too. They are also very funny and having great interaction with the tourists as well.

The shows are very nice too. and very entertaining. The park also very well maintained and clean.

Overall, it is an amazing experience and a must go in Singapore."
,,A very unique safari,5.0,,"We usually do safari in the morning, but it was one unique experience to see animals in their habitat during the night. According to the guide, all animals were trained to be nocturnal. The guided tours are really worth experiencing. The live shows are also great. Do visit, you wont be disappointed."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Went during the month with the Twilight encounters with the neon glow in the dark lights along the walking trails. It was nice when the lights were working, but in some areas, they weren’t so it was a bit disappointing. The tram ride was as usual enjoyable, the animals came up very close to the tram and our guide narrated the usual spiel about the animals in fluent English. The staff were friendly and professional."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,Viewing the animals at night is really a different experience. Some of them are really close. The show was nice.
,,Good outing,4.0,,This place is huge and very well maintained. There is a defined tract with audio guide for about 45 mins but you can venture off the tract on your own and explore. Need at least 3 - 4 hours to cover it well. Time well spent.
,,Absolute Must Do,5.0,,"The MRT won't quite get you here, but the busses to and from are super obvious so don't fret.
Get tickets ahead so you have a reserved time and get in line early for the tram.
Absolutely the best way to see animals at their most active."
,,Wonderful experience at the night safari with animals coming close. My daughter really enjoyed the trip 😀,5.0,,Great place to go. Animals come really close. My daughter enjoyed the trip a lot. 👍 Also very nice fire 🔥 display show
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Unforgettable time in the Zoo during the night. You can find what the animals' behave when the sun goes down and all around is so quiet. You can take the little electric train, or even walk with you foot to feel this unbelievable world. Really worth of your time!"
,,"Entertaining , very educational.",4.0,,Kids will love the trip. The train ride is a must for all visitors. The close proximity of some animals added the excitement for kids!
,,Night safari,3.0,,"The night began with a lighthearted talk about nocturnal animals. A little light on but amusing. Not a good idea to go straight to the tram trip around the zoo after the talk. Lots and lots of people. Take your time and the queue disappears. After the tram ride around the zoo it is a really good idea to walk around and see the nocturnal animals at close range.
A really good night. Eat before or after unless you like fast food."
,,"Never mind the tram ride, if you're just adults",3.0,,"I've been to the Night Safari a couple of times in the 2000s and just recently I popped in for the tram tour. Obviously my memories of visits past were good. This latest experience was not quite as satisfying to be honest. But bear in mind this review is for the tram ride, not the whole experience.
* Many of the fancy animals didn't make an appearance -- giraffe was hiding (!), rhino was sleeping, and there weren't enough cats on the way. This might be simply bad timing, I remember enjoying the night walk through the zoo and next time I will do this and skip the tram.
* Previously I had my young son with me, and that may have made the tram ride more interesting.
* Too many talkative people on the tram. It's annoying but what can you do? They're clearly enjoying themselves.
In sum, I still think the Night Safari is a great idea but best walked through. Skip the tram. I won't describe the walk here because I didn't do it this time and there are plenty of other reviews for that."
,,Fun for children,4.0,,Quite good overall except not all animals are visible on the tram. Certain areas are quite dark but it is a night safari after all.
,,Nice night Safari,4.0,,It was wellorganised but the first hour is not used goos because of not intersting program scheduled before starting night safari by tram.the safari itself was as good as you think that animals are aware and act just like what you want!
,,Fairly ok,3.0,,"Place is nice and staff are ok, but food is terribly expensive! I am expecting to pay not more than $15 for a meal with drink per pax. Not recommended for very young children as they get cranky easily over not being able to spot the animals in the dark."
,,Fun place for kids at night,4.0,,Brought 4 kids between 3-6 years old. Had older folks as well. It was a pleasant outing for everyone.
,,No back up plans,2.0,,"Very poor sight for animals at night time, lights are not bright enough. No backup plan for more engaging activity to visitors, when it rains. They should be ready for disruption. Also, the ticket is too pricey for a limited number of animals."
,,friendly staff and cleanest zoo!,5.0,,My family and I was greeted with smiles throughout the park and the safari was spotlessly clean! Will definitely be back!
,,First Safari Night Experience,4.0,,There was a hugh crowd going into open theatre & finding seating was difficult. The automated train ride doesn't allow Q&A which limits kids learning on animals.
,,Animals at nihgt,4.0,,Nice and short view of animals during the knight. Impressive. Perfect organization. No problem to find the way during the stay.
,,Was much better..Rules take out the joy,3.0,,"Been there roughly 15 times over the past 5 years, at first it was the most amazing place to see and listen to the animals in your own pace. You could take the train hop-on hop-off and walk around the trails when interested or visit a feeding. You could ride the train through the quiet jungle to hear the big carnivores roaring, awesome! 5 stars without a doubt.
However, more recently they have unfortunately turner the park into a money-making-group-site where you must enter the park at a specific slot, so any dinner you want to enjoy in the safari hawker at the entrance must be well scheduled&lucky with the queues. The train is no longer hop-on hop-off but you need to ride it nonstop from start to finish and do whatever walking you want to do separately. Even worse is the fact that nowadays they have installed 50 speakers throughout the train so you must listen to a teenager unenthusiasticly repeat the same jargon (s)he has said 500 times over, and the speakers are set so loud that you will not hear any animals, so it is more like watching TV.. I would still give it 3 stars as it is an amazing place, but I do really hope the management would not listen to a dollar sign consultant but remembers that it is all about the animals and removes these recent ""improvements"".."
,,Fascinating..,4.0,,Fascinating experience..looking forward for more animal crossing the tram..😅 have a pit stop to feed & take photo.
,,Good,3.0,,"This was something I'd always wanted to do, it was good and the tram ride allowed you to see most animals. There are then walking trails to go on. Didn't real feel I saw many different animals from a normal zoo and was probably a bit disappointed."
,,Always good,5.0,,We always enjoy our visits to the Night Safari and this visit was no exception. The tram ride is informative and the show really fun. We will visit again.
,,Tour with family,4.0,,Having a nice trip with family. The place is abit dark with mosquitoes and ants around. Tram should provide earpiece for people who don't know English as my husband is a Chinese. Overall is good place for viewing
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Not really what we expected. Not a great view of many animals and very much a conveyor belt of getting in, on the tram, see the show, eat, stop at the gift shops and out the door. Not good value for money compared to other zoo experiences"
,,Raining and weg experience,3.0,,"Sorry to say, but everybody reccommended this and i had high exspectations which do Not have fullfilled. I had a Sitting Place in the train on the right Side my rucksack was getting wet and my guidebook got wet. We Could Not See and Lions neither some Smaller animals, because of the rain we did Not Walk through the Garden. The Food we Tried before at 6 pm with Otter families and their children was Not very good Tasting and 2 springrolls for 3,90 sd very exspensive. Sorry to say- this was Not my best Trip. We paid a lot of Money."
,,Unique Experience,2.0,,"Interesting and unique idea but poorly implemented. Very noisy music at entrance, limited and basic food offerings. I appreciate thatwild animals do not appear on command but many of the enclosures appeared empty. Tram tour better than walking tour. Would recommend but I didn't think it was good value at S$25."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"I went for NS for second time. First time was way back in 90's.
I found the entire experience has a strong smell of over commercialisation. the entire experience we felt like we were being herded along to fit into tight commercial schedules, rather than a deep personal experience like we did many years back.

The speed at which the cart moves ,most visitors did not even get to really see the animals on both sides, as by the time they heard the announcement and looked we had passed the place and the animal was not visible anymore.

We were not taken past the tiger, which was the highlight of the previous visit.

The show started well with nice announcements which created a lot of anticipation.....but turned out to be a damp squib frankly compared to his it was built up. Over selling and under delivering."
,,Nothing fancy but very educational,3.0,,"Booked a ticket and went for the 9pm slot. The tram journey was about 40 mins. Nothing fancy or wow. Quite disappointed that the animals that we can get close to is only deers,( which has different types, so you will pass through like 4-5 different group of deers.) The tram ride was quite disappointing to be honest. However, the creatures of the night show was good! The host and the crew did an excellent job, most importantly the show is very educational. We also walk at the ""fishing cat"" trail for about 40 mins, I will suggest to get the 7pm slot so that after the tram ride, you can go and experience 1-2 trail. it is more fun to take the trail but also u would want to take the tram to just cover the whole place. Just remember to bring mosquito repellent along!!! Unfortunately we took 9pm slot so it was getting late. We also went there for the neon trail event but such a disappointment! Overall, i will give this place a 6/10, and I advise to just visit the zoo & birdpark!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,The good thing in this place is that they did try to make the animals be at there home still. Its not the typical zafari and I'm pretty sure all the staff did great job about it.
,,Most Expensive of the 3 animal parks and the lowest value for money in return,2.0,,"I am a local and havent been to the Zoo or any animal parks for more than 10 years. Times have changed, tickets prices had grown many times fold. I had a high expectations and for once in a very long time i am surrounded by foreign visitors. However at the end of the day I ended with disappointment and not worth the value I had paid for.
I entered the park with 2 young kids using the concession for locals (15% off). SGD $38 for 1 adult.
There was a light rain and the 7pm tram open slightly earlier than stated.
The kids are so excited to see the animals but ..... it was a disappointed for them.
The tram took about 40 to 45mins around the park. Saw many deers up close , hyenas (cant really see them in a pack), 2 big elephant yes when feeding, lions cannot see hiding inside the mini cave, tiger cannot see, Flamingos yes, giraffe too far away, poor lighted even adults have problem locating the main animals. (I understand it and cant blame the poor lighting because too much light will become an unnatural environment for the animals. There is certainly way for improvement for visibility reasons) Kids were fuming as they cant get to see the main animals. Not mine but others in the tram too. After being in the dark for almost an hour and suddenly seeing so many lights at the alighting station does hurt one's eye especially you had to keep using your eye to search for hidden animals. You will disembark at a shelter for buying photos and the way leading to an animal show.

I would like to highlight safety concern for this animal show. Especially when entering the theater there is only one aisle and this is quite dangerous as there is no crowd control. Some of the foreign visitor do not learn to queue and instead tried to sneak in (pushing their way thru) and cut the queue into the narrow aisle . There is no staff at the entrance of the aisle. accident can happen it some slip or push aanother. i understand there are 3 aisle. But only 1 is used for entering and 3 for exiting.
The creatures of the night show is good and entertaining.
After the show ended the was a 2 way path . We accidentally took the 1 leading out the night safari and thus lost the chance to reenter.

This is a pity. There are many staffs but there presence at main points are lacking. There should be a staff at the exit point advising visitor that it is the exit and they can continue exploring the park by not going out.
I can see why locals are not coming back. High price Low value."
,,Good experience,4.0,,This place is good to go if you never seen a night safari... Children will enjoy the different types of man made forest with animal surviving in real world in that kind of environment...
,,great but don't go when its raining,4.0,,great experience in the tram but the show was cancelled due to rain - check the weather before you go
,,crowd management,3.0,,On a recent visit to the Night Safari in Singapore we found that we spent more time being managed from tram/trolley bus to animal show. Although the exhibits were lovely to see you need to be prepared for queuing and being squashed up in the queues. The staff were helpful before we entered showing us where we needed to go etc
,,Night safari - crowded but fun,5.0,,"Yes, you can actually see the animals at night. Pretty neat because they are out and about - not just sleeping and lounging like often they are during the daytime. There is a tram that gives you a 30-minute tour (no getting on/off), and probably 65% of the exhibits. The rest of the zoo you need to walk to see them. Do the tram first. It was a long wait to get on the tram but worth it. Put bug repellent on!"
,,Night Safari = great & innovative way to show people animal life after dark,4.0,,"Now I have to admit I was sceptical about this - but so happy I went along! Much MUCH cooler than Singapore's crazy tropical day heat, a guided tour with explanation of animals, and loads to see! Remember NOT to take flash picx (as many seem to do), but a great experience nonetheless"
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"We visited the zoo at the beginning of November. Almost every animal were visible. A few of them received their evening meals and were very active. Althought we were lucky because there didn`t visit too many people that evening and we were able to catch the tram almost immediately. We did the walks, too. It was a pleasant experience and if you like zoos I recommend to visit."
,,Unbelievable atmosphere,4.0,,"Fabulously maintained property ! Excellent arrangements. Lot of nocturnal animals... close to 45!’in multi lingual tram ride. Some interesting trails ... love the elephants, leopard and lion. Excellent souvenir store too!!"
,,Good,5.0,,"Night Safari is worth visiting if you are with children. What I loved most is train in jungle with live animals around. One can even walk out to certain places. Small children can be taken in prams. Camera with focus lights not allowed as disturbs the animals. Complimentary food is there . Vegetarian options are available. Overall good Experience
I would say must visit"
,,Fun but limited animals to view,3.0,,"This is the first time I'm went to the Night Safari. Overall it was an OK trip. The staff were super helpful and friendly. The TRAM ride around the entire park was great. I took the TRAM ride and after that walked around the entire park. The only downside was when we walked around the park, there were very limited animals to see. Most of them were either sleeping or hiding somewhere :P
Would suggest to just go for one TRAM ride around the park and you've seen maybe 70% of everything."
,,Great night safari tour but concerns re staff,4.0,,"My sister and I did the night safari at Singapore on the 28/11/2017 and it was a great experience! The animals were literally a metre away and it was lovely to be able to get up close and personal. The entire experience was enjoyable until we watched the Creatures by the Night show which was led by “Yan” (not sure if that is how you spell her name).

For a part of the show, she required an assistant from the crowd and said she would choose the loudest kid. Sure enough many kids tried their loudest voice but it was quite obvious that Yan had her eyes set on this particular girl in the front row. Yan kept looking at this girl to encourage her to participate but the girl didn’t. Yan asked the kids to try their loudest again, only to then say “I have to choose this girl because she is so cute” (her words).

Now I don’t have any kids myself but I found it very concerning that she did not approach the situation with professionalism or equality. With the pressures of today’s society, I personally felt this was ethically wrong as this in unintentionally instilling in children’s minds that looks will get you the furthest. Despite her request for the loudest kid (and there were plenty of them), she ended up choosing a girl who did not participate purely because she was cute.

For a family friendly place, I don’t believe such behaviour is appropriate."
,,Very boring animal show!,3.0,,I visited night safari once every 5 yr and i think the Creatures of the Night show used to be more entertaining. Nw its vy draggy and boring. Less talk pls! Tickets too expensive for spending less than 2hr in there.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,The tram ride was good... wide variety of animals to see at the comfort of sitting in the tram. Queue was very long though probably due to the weekend. Crowd control could have been better.
,,Great for the family,4.0,,"We bought the tickets for the 715pm timeslot. Best part was the creatures of the night show. The kids also like the hedghogs that the zookeepers brought out.

The actual tram ride had some interesting animals, like the lions, tigers, hippos, elephants, hyenas, but was a little long for the younger ones, as it ended at 9pm which was past bedtime."
,,Really nice,5.0,,"If I had time for just 1 activity that is animal/zoo related, this is the 1 I'd pick. First of all the timing is great. SG climate is really humid and during most days it really gets so hot and sweaty! So I enjoy gg outdoors after the sun sets.

Apart from that, the night safari has some really great walking trails and good variety of nocturnal animals. The clouded leopard, tigers, lions, hyenas and sooo many more are all great.

The ""Creatures of the night"" show is great too. Try and queue early though, it tends to get full fast.

Buying a tram tkt is not compulsory but recommended coz it takes a different route compared to the walking route. We get to see the lions, elephants, different kinds of deer, etc really up close. It is a good half hour ride so you get your moneys worth.

Must visit."
,,Great Experience!,5.0,,It was a great experience for my two young teenagers. What a greart family outing! We will visit again :)
,,Great place!,5.0,,"We had such a great time here, in the cool night. Everything was very well organized, clean, and the range of animals was adequate, kept us entertained for 2.5 hours. I will definitely recommend the Night Safari to all my friends."
,,Bachelors,2.0,,Please have more animals and try to increase the lightings. I understand that lights brightness is not good for animals but it is very less which your having now. I have already been to night safari 4 years before. It was good that time but now its very bad.
,,just a time pass if u mis its fine,3.0,,"just a night time time pass place to go, its not many activities all shows you really say wow here. if you free then go"
,,Late night Night Safari Visits,4.0,,"It was a pleasant visit to the Night Safari.
Theres no gurantee that you would actually see all the animals during the tram ride but hey they’re animals so they move around alot. Wished there was more lighting around the lobby area so pictures could be taken clearer.
Staff was also really friendly and helpful throughout."
,,Interesting to see animals @ night,4.0,,"This is a good place for kids; there's so much to see/do, it's not possible to see everything in 1 evening--so you will need to pick & choose what interests you. We got to the park about 1 hour before opening so that we could grab something to eat. There are restaurants (a bit more expensive than in the city). The taxi ride was about 45 mins to get there (w/ traffic). It's located in the outskirts away from the CBD.

You should start queuing when they are about to open the gates. When you enter, they encourage you to head towards the 1st show, but we recommend that you do the tram ride 1st. You can go see the show later. We walked all of the trails in the park and got to see many animals were out (not hiding). There were a few exhibits that were being rehabbed. Overall, we were happy to visit it once."
,,Not exciting & poor value for money,3.0,,"We were told by friends how good this was, but we found it to be poorly organised, overpriced at $45, lack of affordable places to eat & nothing to do while we lined up for the first tram. They should take some tips from Disney! Where was a McDonalds - the KFC was awful & the other restaurants too expensive. It's easy to get here by public transport, but it is a long way out. MRT to Ang Mo Kio on the Red line & 138 bus from bus station opposite the MRT. It's frequent & only goes to zoo & back so you can't get lost. Automated commentary on tram, but other people on the tram were talking so much it was impossible to hear what was going on."
,,Riding through a zoo in the dark,2.0,,"The Night Safari is not a good title for this activity. I've been on safari and this was nothing like it. It was like riding through a zoo at night. It was too dark to see the animals well and they were pretty far away. Also, I fell asleep and missed a good part of it. But I doubt that the parts I missed were all that different from what I experienced."
,,Extraordinary experience,5.0,,"The Wallaby interactive session was insightful. Also, special mention to the supervisor who not only guided us on how to make best use of the the night time but also made our night show experience to cherish forever. Kudos to the Night Safari Team !
Keep it up.
Cheers"
,,Ok for kids,3.0,,"If you've ever been to a zoo, then this is probably not worth your while.
Fairly expensive, and 30-40 minutes outside the city. Unless you are fast-tracked, there can be lengthy queues inside the attraction to get on the main event, being the train ride through the ""jungle"".
As the name suggests it takes place at night so seeing animals clearly is difficult. No flash photography allowed.
Food on site was all tasty. Little overpriced but not extortionate.
Given that there is a lot more to do and see in Singapore, I would not bother, unless you have kids with you, who I think will love it."
,,The Night Safari Experience is awesome,5.0,,"The Night Safari trail is well-thought-out and positioned, in such a way, to make sure that customers see animals at almost every point along the journey. The Babirusas (deer-pigs) habitat was a favorite because these pigs sleep stacked up on each other, which was a really funny sight to see. During our time at the zoo we ate Indian food at Ulu Ulu restaurant. Not all restaurants are open at night so we had a limited choice, however we really enjoyed our Indian meal here."
,,Great,5.0,,This was an excellent experience that every person should do on a visit. You see animals that you may not see during the day. You get an excellent show with nocturnal animals. There is also places to eat.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,We were really looking forward to this and yes it was ok but quite disappointing...obviously it's on a night it's dark so you can't see much and to make it worse when we were there it poured with rain so the few animals that would normally be out was sheltering from the rain . But we were a bit disappointed especially after standing in a huge queue ..
,,Go at night,5.0,,We took the dinner and night tram ride and it was worth every cent. Surprisingly the animals are all awake and visible so you get what you paid to see. Some animals are free to roam - within limits - and are friendly in approaching the tram. Amazing that the animals go about their tasks without any concern over being watched by people in the tram. Very special
,,Night safaro,4.0,,We did the night safari and it was good but can't take pictures at night and of course the animals are hard to see at night. But still nice.
,,Night zoo - book early and respect the animals,5.0,,"DO NOT use your flash, some really ignorant tourists but in the main most enjoy the fun of spotting animals in the dark. Put bug spray on, take your rain coat just in case and walking shoes. Fantastic, eat first to make the most of your time. Great souvenir shops too."
,,Night safari is a unique experience and a must see attraction when in Singapore,5.0,,Night safari is a unique experience and a must see attraction when in Singapore. The tram ride through the rain forest at night is the best way to get up close and view animals in their own environment. Once you have completed the guided tram tour you can walk through separate enclosures getting very close to some nocturnal creatures. The whole park is kept silent with no flash photography and only ambient lighting to guide you through.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Great selection of animals, atmosphere setting, friendly staff and excellent facilities. Comes alive at night."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Went with my two sons aged 9 and 6. They were a bit worried about going to the zoo at night as they thought it would be scary. But when we got there they forgot about being scared and enjoyed watching the animals up close from the tram. They have 3 different timings to enter the zoo the first being at 715pm. We came around 615pm and it was already crowded and there was a long line to enter. We went on the tram ride first and then caught the 830pm creatures of the night show which was very entertaining. We did not go on the walking trails as my sons were tired. Had our dinner at the night safari food was good but so expensive. Overall good experience.
,,Show with Animals,4.0,,Get good seats to watch this show. You would enjoy acts done by different animals. Its fun and entertaining.
,,I love Serval,4.0,,"I am visiting because of servals which is made popular after Kemono Friends. The environment is suitable for animals though, it is not quite suitable for visitors to reach by foot because using light torch is prohibited. May be walking tracks can be illuminated by cold color lights spotting on ground instead of front so that animals are not disturbed."
,,Poor value for money,2.0,,"Good for kids maybe but for adults no way
Like being on Waterloo Station at rush hour felt like cattle being round up
The guided walk didn't happen
Most animals asleep(can't blame them)
If you got up there quickly(we didn't) the buffet meal was quite good"
,,Please visit at least once in a lifetime!,5.0,,I really salute the tour guide on the tram ride because they are very knowledgeable and the sound is clear. I just love it since I love zoo so much!
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"been here with my cousins who were all 7yrs old, it was an amazing experience as we have hopped on the tram for thorough and educational explanation by the instructor, and the signboard in all trip are very precise. it was my first time to look at the fruits bat without any boundaries, and they weren't as scary as I thought! during weekdays, the number of visitors is just nice. 715pm entrance is the best time! however, since we're not Singaporean, the procedures in purchasing ticket for shuttle bus service make us unable to hop on the bus from Khalid mrt station to the night safari, as we do not have an ezlink card to pay for the ticket, and the driver does not accept sgd coins ><"
,,Great evening,4.0,,"Did the Night Safari with an organised tour. Meal before hand was fine. Plenty of choice and very tasty.
Boarded train for a view of the zoo. Managed to see quite a few species, but obviously it is depending on whether the animals are near the boundary.
Afterwards walked around the trails and saw the leopards close up. Main attraction. Would have liked longer to walk around, but on the whole a trip worth making."
,,Night Vision of Zoo,5.0,,A unique experience .. This was our first attraction of Singapore .. we checked in at the hotel and went to the Safari .. They have carts/if you dont wanna walk .. but walking is more fun .. you get to see a lot of animals in the dark .. must see for everyone
,,Well worth a visiy,5.0,,"Great visit. Get there early to get the 7.15 entry. Park opens at 5.30. Grab some food when you get in. Prices for food very reasonable for a place like this. The gift shops were also pretty cheap.

The tram ride is great, the show is good and the walks are good too. A lovely evening."
,,Just excellent,5.0,,Very very famous thing to do in Singapore. Gives you a great experience of night safari. Recommended to do for everyone visiting Singapore.
,,A must do!,4.0,,Loved the night safari and such a highlight to see at the zoo at night- great tour guide and was worth booking! Thank you!
,,The Night Safari,5.0,,A must visit! Features an exceptional show hosted brilliantly by the staff & friendly nocturnal animals. The tramp safari is a treat too. Knowledgeable & well-trained Staff make it an incredible experience!
,,Interesting experience but as usual too loud,3.0,,"As usual the music themes, advertisement and what else is offered is just simply far too load and the noise pollution is not really relaxing for non of the visitors. The big fans under the sun roof are very annoying as we’ll for those queueing in the lanes for shows or the tramp tour."
,,Great place for family with kids,4.0,,Thought I wouldn’t enjoy Night Safari as I’ve been there a few times years back. But it was still exciting and fun when I brought 3 kids aged 12-15. Wish there were more shows or feeding time though.
,,Very disappointing,2.0,,"Having been told this is a must do in Singapore, we set off having booked tickets online. Took the metro and public buses costing a mere $12.60 between us return, so that alone was fantastic value compared with taxis.
Arrived and believing from reviews that all food to buy was located outside the entrance, we had some fairly disgusting and overpriced KFC type food, only to find that having entered the park but before actually going into the safari walk area itself, there are much better food outlets. Our mistake!
While we appreciate it is a night safari, some enclosures were so dark that one couldn't see what was supposed to be inside, and several were under maintenance anyway - have to say that the highlight was the Mangrove Walk through the fruit bat enclosure, and seeing several fruit bats hanging from the branches and a very English looking copper feathered and red combed chicken sitting on a log below them!! Just wish I had taken a photo to show you all! After that we had had enough and took the bus home, avoiding the tram ride through the park, full of oohing and aahing tourists!
To be fair, we have been fortunate enough to go on safari in Kenya, so for those less fortunate, it might have been a good experience."
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,A unique chance to see nocturnal animals close up in their (as near as possible) natural night time environment.
,,It was okay.,3.0,,"Tram ride was great. Was expecting to see more animals. Some of the animals were hidden and due to the low light, it was difficult to see some of the animals. Would prefer Singapore Zoo / River safari as there are more animals to see."
,,Beautiful and Unique Experience,5.0,,"This was recommended to us by local Singaporeans, as we were skeptical of another zoo. This is not another zoo experience. This is an evocative, fun night that is totally unique. On your ride through seemingly jungle roads, you'll get to see active, interesting creatures that you have not seen before. Without enclosure references and with lots of shadows, your imagination will allow you to believe you are in the wild, which is really fun. We also loved the Creatures of the Night show, with more animals that I'd never seen and great performers. A few hints: give yourself some time to get here - it is far from the city on busy roads (we were in traffic for some time), and sit up front at the show (no one does and its a great view)."
,,Vow vow,5.0,,A lovely show in the Zoo. They allow you to watch night life of animals without disturbing animals. Great. One can walk also or can take a small open train.
,,Night safari is not a big thrill,2.0,,"I convinced some friends to go on the Night Safari in Singapore,
We are all very disappointed. although it is well organised, there is no thrill at all.
Most of the animals seem to sleep and the display is poor.
We had expected a lot more, a pity !!"
,,A singapore Tourist Icon not to be missed,5.0,,"Night safari in singapore is a very unique experience. You should buy preferred premium tickets so you have not to stand in a queue. It gives you very close view of very very rare animals. It also runs complete computerised guide to your entire ride in the railway trams. The must watch is the animal show in the mini stadium in side the Night Safari Park. You also get here excellent food, ice creams and souvenirs. If in Singapore must go here, very unique experience."
,,Memorable experience,4.0,,"One must see if you are a animal lover and kids also enjoy by seeing the animals during the night with special lighting,
Tram is good with commentary and one can book advance with combining other river safari and zoo
Don't miss the special show and show with live animal skills demo."
,,Fun evening out with important conservation message,4.0,,"We spent a fun Saturday night at the night safari, on tbe 7.15pm entry. Queues weren't too bad but be prepared to wait a bit for the tram. I recommend doing the tram ride plus all the walking trails as there's lots to see and you do see different things. We got a taxi back to our hotel, there are lots waiting later in the evening. We spent about 4 hours here."
,,A memorable trip,5.0,,One of the best tourist attractions in the island nation of Singapore with many wild animals from across the globe. Most animals were very much visible during the tram ride making it a memorable trip for my little girl.
,,First experience,3.0,,"Paid 40 dollars each online
Need to start queuing at 18:15 itself to get place
Takes about 45 minutes
You will see only deers out that's most of it
It is a matter of luck if the animals are out
Use MRT to go there
Allow 1 hour from centre to that place
Do not forget to queue again for the creatures of the night show once you have done the tour. This was not that bad particularly the fact that the presenter was friendly"
,,Amazing Jungle Adventure,5.0,,"We opted to buy our tickets on-line the day before for the Friday 7:30 entrance. This was a wise move since the 7:30 tickets were sold out when we arrived at about 7:15. There are two food stalls before you get to the turnstiles. We had pretty good BBQ chicken while we watched the short fire show. We noticed as we were leaving later in the evening that there is a food court after you go through the turnstiles. By the time we made our way through the turnstiles, the tram line was long and the animal show seating was full. The park stays open until midnight so the four of us started walking on the super lush and jungle like, fishing cat trail. Since most park visitors were watching the show or waiting for a tram we had the trail to ourselves. We found if you are quiet, the animals are not afraid and continue to do whatever they were doing before you came upon them. You might have to watch quietly for a minute, but most of the time, the animal would appear. We saw the fishing cat snag a fish, throw it on the bank, then walk behind some bushes to eat it. Hyenas were chomping on and cracking bits of bone from a bone hanging from a tree. The bat cave was unbelievable -- it was set up like a butterfly exhibit with numerous doors and screens to go through and then you are right there with rather large bats flying all around. It was impressive and a bit terrifying! By about 10:30 we finished walking all the trails, jumped on an empty tram and saw a few things we could not see from the trails. Our timing was perfect since the torrential rain came while on the tram. We were able to stay dry."
,,Unique,5.0,,"Take a taxi and enjoy a lovely night. Guided tour via tram was relaxing and easy. Walking trails too. Animals include lions, tigers, hippos, rhinos, deer, and much more."
,,Worth going to,4.0,,It was a long bus ride out to this zoo and a bit of a wait to get on trolley to go through the zoo. And hope you have camera that can take night photos without flash. But you can see the animals clearly and its a zoo well set up for these animals. Enjoyed sitting in the eating area watching the fire eaters and the gift shop is worth a visit too. Put the night safari on your list.
,,The night Zoo,2.0,,"Firstly google for tickets and buy on line prior to attending ...if busy you can spend a long time queuing. Once pass the ticket gate there is an area for food drinks and souvenirs ... here is where the fun starts... you line up to enter the queues for night safari ( watching the fire show which is entertaining) followed by another long queue..as each little tram/bus is filled...we waited 45 mins

Excitement was building..after the long and patient wait we boarded our tram and entered the night zone.. the voice over continued to ask people to be quiet...

This is where it is challenging.. sshhh and quiet means quiet.. a group of Adults were loud and I mean loud ...scaring the animals away which sadly meant less nocturnal animals to see and limited our experience... left first part of tour feeling a little disappointed.. but the kid in me loved the tram ride...

We then left the tram and went to the show.. this was well done and entertaining...similar to other zoos..

A number of friends had recommended this over day zoo...

I would do night zoo tour once and once only..and go to day zoo next time..

The underlying critique for me is..the tram has very short stops you view both sides of the road.. and eyes don't get enough time to adjust when looking for smaller animals ...that are there or are they???

And some people just won't shut up...

So if your reading this and a loud person please consider others and zip it...

Happy Travels

Kate"
,,Great tram tour,4.0,,Great tram tour in open bus with some great views of the night animals. Unfortunately very disappointed with the information provided by staff (none) about what wS occuring. Stood in line for 45 minutes then told creatures of night was cancelled. No direction of what was happening after tram ride.
,,Night safari,4.0,,Great night out suggest you do early ticket entry you need to book after you do the safari tram then line up for the animal talk and show it was fantastic you can take photos at the end with the animals we took the mrt and then the safari bus there follow the instructions to get there easy then we bused home from there direct to hotel $6 each buy them there at end of night you will see the stand just ask if unsure
,,overrated tourist destination,2.0,,"I have been to the night safari more than two times (i had to accompany some guest).the first time i visited this place was in 2008 and and the second time is almost a decade later and it was disappointing to note that there was not much of a change and i had wasted my money. It might be amusing for ones with little children and i have noted there are some changes on the walking trails. If you have already visited the singapore zoo, then you wont find much of a difference except that you would be shown around in a tram with some commentary and at night. If you have been to real wild night safari in other countries, then this will not be much of an interest to you. However, if you dont wish to miss one of the popular destinations in Singapore then go ahead and give a try."
,,Not as great as before. Still an experience to try at least once,3.0,,"The newly revamped mode of tram ride, means you sit on the tram, listen to the audio, try to spot the roaming animals around you. All in a span of 40mins. After that, 2 shows are available for you to enjoy. and if you still have time, walk around trails.
Compared to the old one: you can hop on/off a few stations, and I missed seeing the giraffes by the moonlight, what a sight to see.
The tram does not stop anywhere now.
Still, the Night Safari is a must do for any Singapore visit, if you have not experienced a night zoo before.
Do not be intimidated by the crowds at the tram station, they clear them pretty fast.
Note: No flash photography please."
,,Trails,4.0,,After you finish the show and the train ride must take a walk in the trails in the night it's spooky and fun and you can see more animals while walking from being closer to them
,,Just amazing,5.0,,I can't quantify how great this place is. A must visit for animal lovers. ❤ I would recommend you wear comfortable walking shoes and allow as much time as possible to explore.
,,Night Tour,4.0,,"We had an enjoyable three hours what with the tour followed by the show followed by the fire act.We had booked in advance so got strait on a train although I understand there can be lengthy queues at peak seasons.
We had some time to spare afterwards and ate at one of the food outlets which was surprisingly goog"
,,Great fun,4.0,,Worth the visit - fun night out with friends and friendly staff. Recommend it for anyone wanting to see a different side of Singapore.
,,Visitors wonder,4.0,,The Night Safari is a unique attraction. It’s fun for all the family - all ages will like this place. Brought overseas friends with teens to visit. They had a lot of fun and learnt a lot on conservation too. There should be more attractions like these!
,,Night safari experience,5.0,,This experience was very much better than my previous experience many years ago - many things have upgraded. The tram ride was really good - saw many animals.
,,Night Safari. Why bother?,1.0,,"Overrated and overpriced. If you have never been to a Zoo before then may be worth going, otherwise do not bother.It is like a poor Disney Animal Kingdom ride, crossed with a small UK Zoo."
,,Excellent way to see animals at night,4.0,,"The Night Safari is very good. You start of with a drive round and then have several walking tours to follow. My only slight negative was that the signing of the walls could have been better where there were options, especially around the cave. There were also some good dining places at the entrance."
,,Disciplined Animals..Terrible Systems,4.0,,"The tram ride,commentary, the animals in the chilly rainy dark night...Awesome experience for 40 minutes.
The reception area, with no proper signboards, Ill informed security staff...created so much confusion! This cannot be Singapore!! We stood in one Queue...a staff told us to go to reception , we came off, then asked yo go back to the same bloody Q much to the irritation of others already there....so chaotic.
The food court with Indian Japanese Korean Indonesian varieties is pretty good, though a tad pricey."
,,Lovely Zoo for a Night Safari,4.0,,"We did the night safari and found many animals were waiting up for us and were well treated in really good and appropriate (if zoos can ever be appropriate) facilities.
The tour was very heavily subscribed, but the organisation was such that we were both moved quickly through the process and were not made to feel that we were just cattle, so we'll done to the organisers.
One small gripe is the price - a bit steep, but they say a lot of it goes to animal welfare etc, so hard to argue."
,,Four Zoos!,5.0,,"Next to the Singapore Zoo proper are the River Safari and the Night Zoo. The Jurong Bird Park is separate, but will be moving to a new site next to the zoo. The Night Zoo was disappointing; the light is very low to avoid disturbing the animals, so one can't see any color, and the tram does not spend much time with any one animal. But the other parks are great. Some of the monkeys are free ranging and the habitats are excellent. We spent three days seeing all of these zoos."
,,Great experience,5.0,,This is a great experience for anyone who hasn't seen animals up close in an open air setting let alone at night when they are active. There is a tram tour with narration that provided info about each animal. The tram ride itself was about 45 min long which I went on twice. The first tram tour started for 715pm but there are also walking trails you can go on. I made my visit as part of a trip to the River Safari. There are different ticket packages and it is possible to see all 4 parks in one day but I think it would be exhausting due to the heat and walking. I'd say 2 would be good or a second visit. It takes place at night but it was still quite hot so make sure to drink plenty of fluids!
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Very busy on a Wednesday night. The queue to get in started early but then they opened before the set time. Tram ride was the easy option (after waiting in another queue) as we had been walking around the zoo in the afternoon. The animals could be hard to spot as you drove by. I was expecting different animals from the zoo but it was much the same, only in the dark. It would have been more pleasant if the family seated behind us had not talked loudly for the whole trip. No cheap food options in the forecourt."
,,"Do it, do it, do it",5.0,,"Exceptional. Book online for the first trams from 1930, and be ready to whisper in awe to your companions as you are mere metres from a bull elephant, hyenas, wolves, lions, tigers and bears. Oh my! Then proceed on foot to spy on pangolins, leopards, otters and many different deers and pigs. Phenomenal night out. $1 shuttle from the MRT. Check their website for further details."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"My husband and I came here for the night safari and didn’t know what to expect but we had such a great time! It was so cool to see the animals active at night up close and personal. The team takes you through different areas but you can also go through the walking trails.

We loved our experience there. You can also purchase a bundle pass for the other parts of the zoo."
,,Fun entertainment,5.0,,"For something a little bit different be sure to visit the night safari in Singapore. It starts off with a fun show, I recommend heading to the 8:30 p.m. show and then going for the tram ride.

With lions and elephants and lots of other animals this Safari does not disappoint"
,,Shame about the rain,4.0,,"Had prebooked tickets to Night Safari, including Creatures of the Night show. Because of heavy rain our show was cancelled and we were told we could attend the second show......as was everyone else from the cancelled show! Consequently that show was full and no seats available. Therefore we missed out. Tram ride was very good though. As this was the one event we planned to do on our stopover in Singapore, we were extremely disappointed to miss it. Did visit the zoo last year and it was wonderful."
,,5 star Zoo experience,5.0,,1st time visitors to the night safari and not disappointed! It is beautifully set up and the tram ride is brilliant. Go early enough to get the most out of it and have a wander around as well as the tram.
,,Worth a visit if you have a spare evening,3.0,,"The night safari enables you see the animals in a unique way, you jump on a motorised train which then tours you around the park pointing out animals and providing you with some informative information about each specie. The elephant was incredible and had perfect tusks, the only downside was it was hard to see some of the animals and it would have been good to be able to walk past them all at your own speed."
,,Good,5.0,,There are so many people went to night safari on the day i went there. It was quite long queue to wait for the tram ride. But apparently the waiting time is not as long as what we imagine. The queue was so smooth because the service is so good! Thumbs up!
,,Do not WASTE your money. Bad lighting where are animals?,1.0,,"Pickup from hotel was on time, but by the time we arrived at the site it was pouring rain. The trams had roof covers, but often leaked down the sides. THE LIGHTING of the various animal was a VERY dimly lit brown lighting, and the trams did not stop, so most of ones photos were very blurred---that is if the animals were actually in their assigned places. If it was raining I would seek shelter too.

The shows after the tram ride do not have coverage for audience or for the stage, so as soon as it started to rain, the show was cancelled. Singapore gets over 100 inches of rain a year--so WHY are the show venues not covered? All, the vending & food areas were covered.

The guide on the way back to the hotels actually made fun of the stupidity of coming at the start of Singapore's RAINY SEASON. He did NOT get a tip.

If I could give a NEGATIVE 3 stars I would."
,,"Magical experience, not to be missed!",5.0,,"My wife and I went with my son, his wife and 5 year old grand daughter. You go on a 'train' which wends its way through various areas which contain many nocturnal animals. The lighting is very subtle and does not seem to disturb the animals but they can be seen very clearly. There are some areas where the animals can wander right up to the 'train' but others where you are separated in some way from the animals. A good thing as I don't think I would like a lion wandering right up to me. However, the separation is done in such a way that it is scarcely visible by the onlooker.
At the end of the quite extensive tour, you must go to the 'Creatures of the Night' show. The young lady who leads it has an amazingly bubbly personality, is very funny and introduces an array of nocturnal animals who perform tricks, some with audience participation.
A wonderful experience that we will remember for a long time."
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,We went on a Friday night and there were huge queues. Luckily we had pre-booked a tour which involved a pick-up from our Hotel. We were then able to bypass the queues straight on to a tram. There was plenty of room on the tram so there was no problems seeing the animals and taking photos. There were lots of animals to see from the 45 minute ride. We could then walk the trails for further viewing. Unfortunately we missed The Creatures of the Night Show because it was full so I suggest booking a tour that includes a guaranteed seat if you don't want to miss this show. Overall though it was a unique experience not to be missed.
,,Difficult to get too but fun,4.0,,"This place misses out on 5* as it's hard to get too via public transport. The MRT links in with a bus the company put on but this stops before the Safari really opens. Shame! They're are the odd few public buses but ours took us a tourtuous route back to the MRT.
Once you're there it's a fun experience. Take a brolly in wet season!"
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,4.0,,"Great evening activity for everyone. Great shows, very informative, organised and variety of food outlets."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Exceptional venue, enjoyed and learned a lot about the animals, staff were great and ensured smooth wait for carts. Show very entertaining"
,,Nice experience,5.0,,"If you are looking for an interesting and special experience, the night safari is a good opportunity! We started our visit of with a show which is very fun, interactive, and good for children as well. After that we did the safari with the tram. This is very nice since you can sit back and enjoy the ride through the park with an audio in English (or other Asian languages) explaining about the animals and the park. Finally we did the walking tour, which allows you to discover the different night animals in the order you want.

It is a very interesting experience since all the animals who would sleep and lay around during a normal day visit, are now active and walking around. Unless you are a good photographer, don't bother to bring your camera. Since it is not allowed to use the flash and the living environment of the animals is relatively dark, it is very hard/ almost not possible to get a good picture.

It is quite expensive, but definitely worth for this unique experience!"
,,Overall good experience,3.0,,"The Night Safari has a very good setup to see a wide variety of animals. Make sure you book your tickets online for your preferred entry time, as they have set times for entry due to the schedule of the animal show.
Only downfall was that there were quite a number of animal enclosures that were closed but no mention when we purchased the tickets or at the gate."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,Most zoo’s show animals during daylight but Singapore shows them in the night. It’s really amazing. Due to the darkness animals seem more calm and as if you can see them closer.
,,Night Safari at the zoo,3.0,,This was ok but you don’t see that many animals. The creatures of the night show afterwards was excellent though. Was good to experience the zoo at night
,,"Really good zoo, but at njght",5.0,,"A good range of animals at this night safari, and all animals are really close which makes the experience much better. Also all the animals are awake and in sight not hidden away like in some zoos like london. You also get to walk through a cage full of bats which is a good experience and something different. Other parts you sit on a tram and you also have a chance to walk through. A great experience overall"
,,different but didn't ring true,3.0,,"Lot of walking between exhibits. Seemed somehow set up when big cats and other animals just happened to be in the viewing windows. Didn't know that giraffes and elephants were nocturnal; probably backed up by only one of each being visible, maybe they take it in turns ti be on the night shift!!! Sort of enjoyed it but wouldn't go again or recommend it for the asking price"
,,very nice place to visit,4.0,,"Our kids loved the zoo so much.The most impressive show for them was fire performance outside the Night Safari gate.They're also very interested to the talking parrot. They also had a lot of fun at the bird park kids area(as the kid area at Zoo was closed for maintenence).
We bought the 4 park parkhopper tickets. If you have enough time, I advise you to spend 1 whole day at Singapore zoo for zoo,river safari and night safari. Bird park is another place to spend half a day(with kids,probably a whole day).
However you need to purchase your meal as early as you can. Because before night safari the meals were almost sold out, left only limited choices. We didn't really enjoy food that much at zoo.
Anyway, we had very good time at Singapore zoo and thank you for your service!"
,,Discover Wild animals by night,2.0,,Would be great the driver can drive slower for the last wagon to take pictures just like the first wagon behind him. Impossible to take a single shoot at the back. What's a shame and waste of time.
,,Enjoy,5.0,,A visit to Singapore isn’t quite complete with or a visit to the day : night zoo. We literally spent all day and night between the two parts Amazing!
,,Good,5.0,,Night safari is a amazing experience. All the animals are in open space including tigers. We have to be in golf carts. Amazing experience.
,,Open safari in the dark,5.0,,"This is a one of its kind night park. The tram tour is a must as it covers the entire park but you gotta walk the trails to get a better feel.
The entire park is open so don’t be surprised if you see animals on the road/ tracks but then, that’s the charm of this place! Do remember to carry a map and plan beforehand which all habitats you want to visit. be ready for a long walk and if you got kids with you then ensure they are protected with mosquito repellent.

They have a periodical show “creatures of the night” , that’s a must see too and please keep the show timing in mind while exploring the place (try and reach the venue about 20-30 mins beforehand to get good seats)."
,,Choose your night wisely,3.0,,"We made the mistake of going to the Night Safari on a Saturday night, arriving in Singapore earlier that day after a long flight. The Night Safari was very busy and the lines were all a bit too much. We lined up to get tickets to find when we got to the counter that we needed to line up at another counter (they were unsigned). Lined up again to eventually be told to go back to the other line. A couple of lines later, we lined up to enter the park to then line up for the tram ride. We spent almost three times the amount of time for a relatively short tram ride. Had we had the energy, we would have wandered around the park on foot.

The tram ride was good and it was nice to see the free range animals so close up. The size of the enclosures and behaviour of some of the larger animals may make you a little uncomfortable."
,,Nice Experiance,5.0,,"Unfortunately it was raining cats and dogs during our visit at the Singapore Zoo at night, but nevertheless it was a great expiriance and we would do it again everytime. We started the tour first by feet because so many people stand at the queue for the cars and at the end of the day it was the right decission, because you see different animals on the both tours. So, you should do both trips. First by feet and after this by car because no one is waiting if you come back after the first round. In summary we needed 3.5h for both tours and every minute was nice and never boring. If you have the possibility to use a red light flash you can make sensational pictures. An usual flash light is not allowed and this absolutly correct for the reason the animals will lose there night view if people use flash lights. One special tip: For the tour back to to city we used one of the shuttle services and we had a flat price of 24 S$ for 3 people."
,,A drive through the animal park,3.0,,"The night safari is a decent attempt and bringing together a variety of animals. The attempt to put it together in the form of a safari while credible is still a far cry from watching these animal in free environs. That said it is worth a visit. Kids will enjoy as one can see the animals at length rather than fleeting glimpses.

The animal show thereafter is passable. Serves more as creating awareness of loss of natural habitat and animal life rather than being truly entertaining. Again kids will enjoy."
,,Night Zoo Experience....FRUSTRATING Experience... !!!,2.0,,"We were a couple traveler, went on Saturday, visited Night Safari Park with different expectation in terms of Safari experience and watching animals at night, freely roaming here and there; but it moreover turned out to be a NIGHT ZOO experience which was very very crowded. Animals seem to be disturbed at night time. As they were locked in and dim flashlights were on them for us to spot them.
Safari Experience - To get into the Night Safari park it took more than 45 mins to 1 hour. Highly frustrating. Advice to people - KEEP DRINKING WATER HANDY all the time.
To get into a Tram we waited for more than an hour. It turned out more frustrating. AN ADVICE to the administration people, please don't try accommodating too many people at one go OR if you want to, please have more arrangements and space. It was quite hot and humid day, everyone standing in the queue full of sweat and frustration, especially kids were crying, there should have be more Air coolers, Trams, or less people at one go.

Advice to Visitors - Avoid going on Weekends. Also, if you plan to visit Singapore Zoo that will be better idea because you will enjoy with kids better in day time having to see more animals. We did visit Singapore Zoo same day with Night Safari and felt that we should have gone with the zoo only.

Night Safari had one AVERAGE Animal Show (host was good) on first come first serve basis running every hour. We had to wait for another 1.5 hours for that, as the house was full.

Overall Experience was HIGHLY FRUSTRATING!!"
,,Go there at night,5.0,,Special experience to go at night. There is a tram that drives you around but you can also walk. Buy Tickets to skip lines
,,Unique activity,4.0,,"Travelled with my elderly Grandmother; this activity was easy to access the tram ride and shows. The customer service was excellent. Tram ride lasts approximately 45 minutes and was very interesting, fun sighting the animals and enjoyable. This is suitable for the elderly (they keep front row seats for this reason) and strollers could be folded up and stored at rear of tram. Night trails are accessible and good way to see more animals with children or couple though was too difficult for elderly persons.

Overall a very good different type of activity that required less walking than the zoo during the day."
,,Try The Night Safari,5.0,,Have been here several times so did the Night safari. Well run zoo good variety of Animals and all look well taken care off. Kids love this and good for adults as well
,,A great experience,4.0,,Went last night. I really enjoyed. The weather was perfect for it. If you're into nature and animals this is definitely for you. Love it being pitch black out with the light spotlighted on where each animal exhibit is. Has a spooky aura to it. A great variety of animals can be seen on your left and right. The only downside if it can be a downside is no pics can be taken due to the tram always moving and it being so dark out. I understand the flash can't be used to trigger the animals. It's something you gotta take in and enjoy and put your phone/camera away. Tram ride is about 15-20 minutes I'll say. Plenty of places to eat and gift shops to enjoy. They take your pic upon entering the park and when you hop on the tran which is cool too.
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,"My partner and I visited for the night safari and what an experience it was.To see the animals at night was incredible. The zoo has illuminated the enclosures to resemble moonlight and giving just enough illumination to be able to see the animals. A tram takes you slowly past the enclosures giving you ample time to peer into the enclosures to see what the animals are doing. Some of the non dangerous animals eg deer are roaming and pass alongside you as you pass by. We found it very different to seeing the animals in the traditional daylight times.It seems that it very popular judging by the large queue of people awaiting the trams. Tip - consider a pre booked trip, we were on one and so by passed these queues to a reserved section for our tram. There is also a free animal show at various times which was not reservable and we were fortunate enough to be able to attend this as well. It is set in an amphitheater style of setting and keepers introduce various animals to the audience. Some of these eg owls fly around above you. Quite an interesting show and was well received by the adults and children present."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,How nice feeling in the tram to see animals night life. Don't miss to visit Night Safari. My son coming from overseas enjoyed Night Safari with his wife. It was not so hot and humid but gentle window blow on that day.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,What a tour of nocturnal animals! The zoo takes adequate care that the animals are nit disturbed during the safari Wonderful tram services Adequate guidance Must visit
,,creatures of the night,4.0,,The tram ride was very enjoyable as were the walking trails tha show could be better if I had known what I was standing in line for I would have skipped it in favour of more time on the walking trails
,,Singapore Zoo - night safari,5.0,,The Singapore Zoo is well planned and offers a great experience for children and adults alike. I especially enjoy visiting the zoo at night and the night safari tram ride.
,,A nicer experience.,3.0,,"We visited the Night Zoo. We either had a poor visibility or simply the animals were not there. The trails presented a similar challenge. I hope to visit the zoo during the day in the near future. Another challenge that I had was that I bought two tickets for all the 4 attractions on line to find out when i arrived that three of the activities were not active during the night. Since i was leaving the following day and the tickets were not refundable, i could not use the additional days of the tickets, therefore, I paid for activities i didn't use and almost double the price of the ticket. I wish I could have known the schedule better - perhaps, it was there and didn't looked close enough or it was not there. So mixed feelings - too dark and no refund."
,,night safari,2.0,,not much to see at night instead of this pl attend daytime in singapore zoo as not able to see any animal during trip may be 20% of animals out
,,Night Safari in November,4.0,,The tour was good and please do the walking trails also as you see the animals closer and there are other that you won't see from the tram.
,,Must Visit Attraction,4.0,,The Night Safari tram ride was good through at times few of the animals were not visible because of the dark ambience. But overall a good experience. Also the performance like Fire show and Creatures of the Night show were awesome.
,,Excellent Trip at Night,5.0,,Interesting and excellent Creatures of Night show. Tram ride was good. Lots to see. Children enjoyed it very much.
,,Not worth the expensive payment,1.0,,"Its TOO expensive. Everyhing. From tickets to food to souvenier. Its hard to see any animals clearly, let alone taking any pictures and the lines are too long and too much to handl. Not a worthy place to visit."
,,Night Safari!,4.0,,The Night Safari experience at the Singapore Zoo is quite wonderful. I especially enjoyed the up-close encounter with the flying foxes and fruit bats! So many animals are active in the relative cool of the evening. I went with my work team and everyone loved it!
,,Great evenings entertainment,4.0,,"Started off poorly. Masses of queues everywhere, just being herded. Went the the show first. which to us seemed very poor. Few animals and more time spent interacting with the children/ crowd than doing or saying anything with the animals. After that we went on the train ride which was good. After that we got off onto the paths and walked. Clearly most people do not do this. We then got away from the crowds and it was a great experience seeing the creatures at night. When we got back to the entrance we were about the only one left. So forget the show and teh crowds and go walkabout."
,,Not all it's made out to be,2.0,,"Spent a night a Singapore night Safari. Tram ride around the park gave viewing of only a few of the animals and the commentary was very scripted to the point of distracting from viewing the animals. Driver was no help in terms of finding animals and moved on as soon as they were located. Walking tour is much better. Too many exhibits being renovated so animals not on show, but should be advertised. Also too many of the same animal types, ie Deer, bovine and porcine species."
,,Great thing to do,5.0,,Had a great evening but the smart local advice is eat and drink offsite... A bottle of tiger beer was $13.50. Next hint is to go a bit later say 8.30pm... by then it starts to quieten down. If you go early then don't follow the crowd to the trolley bus. Go walking round first and by 8.30pm you will have the trolley to yourself. The troĺley well worth doing and takes you to.places and views you don't get from walking.
,,OMG,5.0,,Absolutely a must dont miss it .You need to do the tram ride and do the walk you see different things on both we would do this again and again words cant explain the quality of this amazing attraction and dont miss the pre start show the best way to start your visit to the park
,,A Family Night out,4.0,,"Get your pick and drop arranged well before visiting night safari. Buy your ticket online if possible to get 5% discount.
Do’s;
* wear some mosquito repelent
* Do watch the fire show before entering the safari
* don’t sit near families with infants as they cry alot
* take a walk right after the train tour.
* don’t miss the last show “creatures of the night”

Donts;
* Do not be late
* Don’t be super excited as some of the animals do not appear at night specially the wild ones...
* do not use camera’s with flash as they are prohibited...

Overall, a good family outing.."
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"go for it only if you have a powerful camera to take night photos. nothing exceptional. very few animals are seen, better to go for river safari during daytime."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,I liked the tram but after that there was a lot of rain and creatures of the night show was also cancelled. There was no arrangement for refund or discount. Hence the 81 dollars spent and the hour long commute was not worth the experience
,,Great zoo,5.0,,One of the greatest animal experience with the family. The zoo is terrific and the night safari a must see while in Singapore.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Tram ride was OK OK types, you will get to see animals and the show was also fine... You can skip this attraction more or less..."
,,Good stuff,4.0,,"Night safari is good. Advice to be on time u can watch fire show. One should go for all the shows and take a tram ride and do various trails.

Between night safari & zoo, if u have kids, I will advice go for zoo. Kids will enjoy more.

,,Very well maintained,4.0,,"One of my highlights of Singapore trip was the night safari... very well maintained throughout... good trams... they have headphones that offer you assistance in many languages..has lots of wild animals and all very well looked after... you get a very nice feel ..kids as well as young people will enjoy... Definitely must visit .
Has good restaurant for dinner and good ice cream Parlour’s too..."
,,Good But Needs Some Refreshing,4.0,,"I'm a WRS member so making a trip to either the Zoo, or Night Safari, or River Safari is a must. However, I would have to say that the Night Safari seems smaller with the no. of exhibits being closed, the reduction in 1 tram stop and the seemingly hiding nocturnal animals that we never seem to be able to even get a glimpse of even after visiting so many times.

I really think and hope that the management of the Night Safari will seriously look into these matters and improve on them as the number of visitors have dropped over time and it's losing its relevance."
,,Something different for a zoo,5.0,,"Really nice experience. Very busy place, but we went to see the show first and then catch a tram very fast for the safari experience. It was a relaxing experience after a busy day in Singapore."
,,Visit to night safari,5.0,,"My visit to the night safari was wonderful, with lots of nocturnal animals to see. The staff on site were friendly and helpful in guiding us our directions. It was a totally new experience in visiting the animals at night, as compared to the day when you visit a zoo."
,,Cool way to see the zoo,5.0,,Me and my family visited here and had a great time. It was very busy but we had a guide showing us around which helped. We went on the tram tour and saw loads of different animals and also walked around the zoo afterwards too. The gift shop had lots of cool things to buy which weren't too expensive and we got given a free night safari magnet each!
,,Lots of people.,4.0,,"Very popular attraction with lots of people. They do a good job of managing the crowds. S $45 p.p.
It's a slow tram ride in the dark winding around the various animals.
Animals are behind a moat or trench so there are no visual fences and cages. There is subdued light to simulate moon light and therefore some animals are a liitle difficult to see. The tram takes about 40 minutes and has commentary. We also walked the same trails after the tram ride. Food options are available but are a bit limited and not cheap.
We travelled by MRT to Choa Chu Kang and then public bus right to the entrance. It's a bit of a trek but a cheap option."
,,Loved it!!,5.0,,"Really lovely evening, lots of the animals out. Loved seeing the rhinos, elephants and slow Loris. Lots of fun!"
,,有點安排可改善的動物園,3.0,,"actually it is modified by the Singapore zoo at daytime. Therefore when I visited the zoo at day time and ride by tram at night, I feel not much amazing. The arrangement is not good, sometimes the staff cannot give clear instructions. The environment is very dark so it is hard to see animals. The show is good. It promoted environment protection."
,,Good one,4.0,,"Experience was good. Though we went on a working day, the queue was very long. If you have to see all the animals, I would recommend going for normal viewing rather than night safari. Main attraction of this program is the nocturnal creatures show. That was an awesome experience."
,,A Beautiful way to see the zoo,4.0,,Night Safari is one of its kind in the world and amazing way to see wildlife.do come early so to avoid the long queue.
,,Over crowed but a wonderful experience,4.0,,"We arrived at 7:15 pm in a week day, and it was over crowed with VERY long queues for the tram. So we went to aee the show first, then we did the walking trails and we finally took one of the last trams. It was so quiet then, it was almost magical! A to be done experience!"
,,Mommy’s day out,4.0,,I was with my mom on a wheel chair and it was very difficult to do on the walking trails. If y’all can do something about that it would be very helpful.
,,A lot of fun if you understand how it works,4.0,,We saw quite a few active animals from the tram but it can be hit or miss. Walking the trails for a good hour after disembarking was much better. But not many people seem to understand you can do that. We missed the animal show after the tram — again bad info. The crowd is overwhelming. It’s better to catch a later show.
,,Night Safari was great,4.0,,"The night zoo is wonderfully laid out. We got there at the opening time and was in queue at 7.13pm and walked through the gates at 7.15pm, only to be told that the show in the amphitheatre was full (Despite the park opening at 7.15pm and the show starts at 7.30pm). In any case, we made it in the show and notice that it was not in fact full (only 5/6th full) as there were many seats empty still on the side. The standard of the show has fallen and is not as good as the past (no surprise snake segment or falling into water).
Furthermore, the tram no longer stops at different stops. Therefore, anyway who wishes to walk would need to walk through the whole park and will no longer of the option of doing loops furthest away from the entrance. This is not ideal for young children or older people who may only be able to walk parts of the park and not the whole. Overall, however, the night safari is one of our favorite places to visit and we would recommend this to anyone."
,,Awesome for kids,5.0,,"During our last stay in Singapore, we took the kids to the Singapore Zoo to enjoy the night safari. Highlight for us were the fruit bats flying next to us and sucking on a banana like hummingbirds on a flower"
,,First time visit and was recommended by my friends,5.0,,At first we thought it was just another zoo. Since my children wanted to go we took them to night safari. Didn't know it was this great! We would like to visit again for sure. Didn't have time to go through the walking trail but next time for sure. I like the fact that Night Safari is saving other wildlife around the world. Please keep this up and save our animals world wide!
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Probably the best zoo in the world.

Make sure you take both the walking trails and the tram. You see different things.

Getting there a bit of a hassle. Took a bus there, and an Uber back. Uber was about $15. That is probably the best way to go. You can book tours with transportation to/from the city."
,,Very exciting experience,5.0,,"We have been there @1915h and this was a wise decision. There is so much to see! First we took the train. Although there were a lot of people we didn't have to wait too long to catch one. The explanations we had been given there were very valuable later on when we were walking the trails. (And had more time to watch the animals.)
Seeing these broad range of animals at night was a very exciting experience - for us parents as well as for our kids. This is a great zoo - but being there at night was overwhelming."
,,A night worth a ride,4.0,,"If you love animals then here you go...an hour spent here is worth as you would find few unique ones other than the usual ones you would find in the zoo. Flamingos are breathtaking and a joy ride in the night, worth an adventure..."
,,Stunning Night Out,4.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the Night Safari and all the animals showed themselves even the timid otters. The commentary given was good and informative only spoiled a bit by some talkative people.
,,It was okay..,3.0,,"I went here for the first time and i was expecting more activities but its too crowded, and u might get lost too , dont forget to bring insects repellent esp bring the sprayed ones it helps alot for your legs just in case. Its was okay. I had my experience but i still love to go to the zoo on day light"
,,Only highlight in the entire Zoo trip,4.0,,"It is a good experience, post the forgettable experience of the zoo. Do take the earliest slot of 7.15. The authorities tend to open the restricted area for this trip.
Along the road, some fresh fodder is kept which brings the animals out and thus it is easy for us to spot them. Thus, it makes sense to pick up the earliest slot, since am quite sure post their initial fill the animals might go away deep in side the forest.
There is another live show in the night which again is good to watch. Don't miss this show."
,,Very crowded but great,5.0,,Do go early at about 5.30-6pm to get tickets for the first entrance at 7.30pm. Nice food court for dinner. Super long queue for tram. The tram is super nice; animals viewing is very close to you. Do watch the show; creature of the night is excellent. Do choose at least 1 trail to walk for the experience. Overall: it is pretty safe and exciting.
,,Impressive crowd control,4.0,,That was our first visit to Night Safari. Nice experience. Your service crew is really well trained. Especially enjoy the good crowd control measures put in. It added a touch of care and made our visit very pleasant. Thank you.
,,Show is something OK but night walk is really nice,4.0,,Don’t forget mosquito repellents. Show is not that great so once you have kids they may liked but once you’re adult - just walk the trails. Enjoy night sounds 🦉🦉🦉
,,Great Exprience,4.0,,"A great night outing, a must see. I strongly suggest paying extra for the tram express and bypass the long lines of people waiting. Trail walks are well worth doing as well."
,,To far from city centre,3.0,,Its to far from city centre. Not so much you can see in the darkness. Don't forget to bring your mosquitos propellent
,,Crowded when we visited,4.0,,"This was at 7:15pm when we had crowded entry gate before us. Though after opening of gates crowd reduced a bit.
We first seen Animal show with various nocturnal birds and animals with white python.
We took Tram ride with guidance in English. It was 40 minute ride and passed through various areas showing lions, deers, Hippopotamus etc..
Overall at the end we enjoyed this park satisfactorily."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"The Night Safari is a different experience compared to your regular zoo, mainly because you're viewing animals at night. You have two options to explore the area: either walk the four trails or take the tram ride - the latter option is the reason why people go. We purchased tickets for 8.15pm entry, which wasn't as crowded.

The only downside is that it can be quite difficult looking or finding the animals in the dark, particularly if you have poor eyesight. There is also no flash photography allowed therefore any photos you take would be poor unless you decide to bring a professional camera.

Tip: try to avoid sitting towards the end of the tram (if possible). Our tram driver would slow down to allow sufficient time for the first carriage to view the animals. However once it was the middle/last carriage's turn to drive past, he would speed up and we didn't have time to look."
,,Memorable and must see attraction,5.0,,If ur on Singapore u must go for night Safari u see the animals very very closely sometimes I get scared also but it's really exciting..
,,Excellent adventure,5.0,,"We were unsure of taking this tour but were persuaded by people we met in Singapore. And we are glad we did. It's a bit of fun, as adults we sometimes forget to think like children and this is what you have to do on the night safari. Loved seeing the animals, lions, tigers, elephants and rhinos. Lots of deer and pigs! Though it is effectively a zoo. Look out for the slow Loris on the Fishing cat walking tour - amazing! We booked through Viator and then the company was RMG tours. Take deep breaths, it is a bit like Being herded or on a school trip. Our guide was great, though quite officious and bossy. Expect to be transported to a bigger bus after collection from hotel. Overall they were efficient. Don't be put off by other reviews just know what to expect. The night safari makes it worth it and you get priority admission and a priority tram ride. We didn't watch the show but did do a walk after the tram ride where we saw some smaller creatures. Then we went for a beer. It's hot and sticky but not unbearable."
,,"Zoo itself was okay but way too overcrowded, SAEX shuttle bus didn't show up",2.0,,"Positive:
It was a unique and exciting experience to visit a zoo at night and see some rare animals.
It appears that there is no cage for most of the animals. Visitors can see animals in a short distance.

Negative:
The zoo was way too overcrowded. I arrived at around 7:30 and had waited for nearly an hour to get on the tram. Then when I finished the ride, it was almost time for the last creatures of the night show. Then after the show, it was already after 10 pm, and I had to catch my pre-booked transfer shuttle. The ticket was expensive, and the location was remote, but I did not get to see much.

The SAEX shuttle bus was total crap. I started waiting at the pickup point outside of my hotel 10 minutes before the said arrival time; the bus never showed up. When I finally called after 30 minutes, I was told that the bus has already gone. I suspect that the bus never took the route advertised on their website."
,,its a great night but night animals arnt as easy to see as the zoo.,3.0,,was a well presented tour of the night animals but when its hard to see most i would probably take in the zoo or the tropical river cruise they have. never know if displaced animals are happy tourist trap as well
,,A Good Experience...,4.0,,The trip was too short. I suggested best to have another round tour because during the first round we tends to missed the scene... at least if there is a second round tour we will alert n covered that missed scene so dat at the end of the safari ride we have viewed all the animals...
,,Great Concept,5.0,,"Such a great concept; invite the tourists at night and let them loose in a park where it's dark, kids and all.

We bought the ticket as part of 4 in 1 package (Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park). In one day we visited Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari (arrived 11.30am, back at the hotel 10pm) . The lady at the Singapore Zoo booked us for 7.15pm time slot for Night Safari.

2 minutes walk from River Safari, 4 minutes walk from Singapore Zoo.
Plenty of restaurants just outside the entrance gate, albeit expensive.
Fiery stunts, Thumbuakar Performance was very entertaining.
Wifi at all parks enable us to get Uber home.

Best to do first was to board the tram, it took us around the park. Then we walked the trails in leisure visiting the animals at different enclosures. A little hard to see as it dark (duh' it's at night!), but lots of staff around to help with crossing roads as there were trams in operation around the park.

Not everyones cup of tea, but we enjoyed ours."
,,Kids wanna go back again!,4.0,,"Kids enjoyed so much and want to go back again :) Easy to go around with regular tram services, safe & well guided trekking trail and friendly staffs. The show was also interesting and entertaining :D"
,,Exceedingly average,2.0,,"We went to the night safari on a Thursday night, and I think we could sum up our experience in one word - underwhelming. We pre-purchased our 8.15pm tickets through our hotel and after the 30 minute Uber from Robertson Quay we joined the hordes or people who were lining up for the ‘trams’. After a long wait, we did enjoy the journey around the park, and the opportunity to see so many beautiful animals quite close was great - but once the ride was over, that’s where things really ended for us.

We went to the Creatures of the Night show, and left 10 minutes in. We felt that the animals didn’t look at all comfortable, but probably what put us off the most was others in the crowd. Even after being asked not to, the audience were continually taking flash photos (a big no-no) as well reaching out to touch the poor animals as they were paraded last by their handlers (an even bigger no-no). We realise this isn’t the park’s fault as you can’t control absolutely everyone, but I feel that patrons should be ejected for such behaviour, particularly given the amount of times the animal’s welfare and the park’s commitment to conservation were mentioned during the tram ride.

If you are going to go, I recommend a few things:

- Bring water with you. There wasn’t an opportunity to purchase any once you got into the line (and trust me, you don’t want to lose your place!) and keep your bottle once it’s empty. There is a water filling station near the Creatures of the Night show. We also noticed that the food and beverage prices at the park were very high, which is to be expected I guess.

- Try and sit on the right hand side of the tram if you can. You’ll see the Lions and Rhinos on your side, and for us this was a highlight.

- Be prepared to wait in a lot of lines.

- Use Uber to get to and from - there’s free wifi at the park, and you’ll easily be able to get a ride. I think we paid $30SGD to get there, and about $18SGD to get back to Robertson Quay.

- If your hotel room has one of the ‘handy’ devices (the wifi-enabled device you can take with you around Singapore) check the offers as there is likely to be ticket discounts on offer. After booking, we noticed that if we had booked it through this system we would have saved 30% on the entrance fee."
,,Highly recommended for all ages,5.0,,"This night safari is the coolest!

Really had fun with the show, the tour, its a good experience.

Kids and adults will surely have a good time there.

There are vans located in Ang Mo Kio Station that will bring you to the place.

Highly recmended"
,,Great but could be better,5.0,,Booked online first time on my mobile wasn’t successful. Hope the mobile booking could be easier and faster.
,,Missed opportunity,4.0,,We did the night safari but didn't get to see the show because it was already full when we got in. We did the safari which was great fun but then the next show on our return was full too. Disappointing.
,,Dark safari,3.0,,"Nothing much to look forward to .
We missed out on the animal show. First ride gate opens at 7.15 pm. There will be a huge queue. 30-40 minutes before you board one of the open vehicle. 30 min approx time taken for covering via the vehicle. Then you can explore via the designated pathways by walking. Near the entrance , pyro artists will perform every certain duration. Frankly speaking , night safari can be given a miss.. if at all you want to see the animals in night time."
,,Too Busy,2.0,,Very busy with lots of queuing. Difficult to see the animals and the show fairly mediocre. Very much designed for young families but not so great without kids.
,,This place should not be missed!,5.0,,"Amazing concept and very well arranged .
Loads of visitors come here every night but they have organised all the rides and shows in an organised manner...
The tram ride is thrilling as you get to see all kinds of wild animals.
Even their night time show is so good.
A definite must do in Singapore and should not be missed!"
,,Dont waste your time!,1.0,,"This is one of those tourist traps designed to make you hand over as much money as possible.
Firstly, the only positive aspect. It really is a cool and different way of seeing animals and the habitats are as natural as possible and on the tram ride, you do get quite close to most.

Secondly...the negatives. Our bus (arranged by Night Safari) arrived 20 minutes late. We were then driven to the mainland (we were staying in Sentosa) which took around 40 mins, before being transfered onto a larger bus for the final 40 minute drive to the Night Safari. No one was told that it would be an 80 minute trip with no access to toilets...and being Singapore weather you drink alot of water!

We didn't arrive at the park until around 7.30pm, had to wait while our tickets were found...eventually got into the park at 8.00pm. Followed up by lining up for an hour for the tram. So we finally finish the tram ride at 9.20pm, and have to be back at our return bus by 10pm. Gave us around half an hour to try and look at the walking trails.
Tried to grab a cold drink on the way out ($8 for a small can of coke that was hot, and $12 for a small chips).

Due to the price, and the insane amount of time spent lining up for anything and everything, I highly recommend giving this place a miss.....if you can go on a weeknight it may be a bit easier to get around, but I found it a waste of money and time (we went on a Friday night)."
,,"Ok, but not brilliant for little kids",2.0,,"Long queues (forty minutes to get into the zoo itself through the turnstiles) is never fantastic with small children particularly when there is no other entertainment to keep them busy or distracted. Felt it was a missed opportunity for some sort of entertainment out the front of the zoo while everyone is waiting for so long to get in. When inside, we walked around the zoo because the queue was too long to wait for the safari bus (we were told it would be at least a half hour plus wait). The walk around the zoo itself was interesting and the children delighted in finding all the animals along the way. Amazing how all the animals looked so much bigger at nighttime - particularly the lions. Long stretches of paths with no animals where we weren't sure if we were heading in the right direction - some additional attendants would be useful from a way finding perspective. We did a few unnecessary laps of the same enclosure a few times. Another tedious queue for the show (another 40 minutes) - again another missed opportunity for some entertainment (or education) while everyone waited about in lines. Maybe it was exceptionally busy because it was a Saturday night and perhaps it isn't always that busy. The show itself was interesting although as fabulous as the otters were (they really were lovely), I'm not sure it was worth all the waiting about. Would I go again? Not at night, although I would go again during the day as the Singapore Zoo really is magnificent and world class - just when it's not as crowded."
,,Be ready to be part of the crowd,3.0,,"Once you get on the tour and the animal shows, the Night Safari shines. Unfortunately in between these activities there is a lot of queueing and crowds which is not ideal when you are travelling with older folk and young kids. Find a quieter time to visit, perhaps when it is not the school holidays."
,,Awesome Evening with the animlas,5.0,,"Awesome attraction, we were lucky and we went on a night that was not that busy and wwe waited till later to take the tram ride, There was only a few of us on it and it was very enjoyable. It was worth travelling from Perth, Australia for this experience."
,,It is indeed kind of a safari,4.0,,It was indeed kind of a safari; the animals (not the dangerous ones of course) where sometimes very close. We liked it.
,,Drop in Experience,2.0,,"I visited 5 years ago and it was much better than the present.
For once, the fire dance had more dancers before and was much more entertaining.
The Creatures of the dark show was indeed too draggy and featured to few animals.
Much more improvement needed."
,,awesome night,5.0,,Brought my friend from Toronto to visit the Night Safari! Never get bored of sucha please. So peaceful and quiet and safe!
,,Bad Bad Bad experience,1.0,,"Its hard to see the animals, most of them can see were deer deer and deer.
The show 1st come 1st served and que up long time for the cable,miss the show. If u want to watch the show, u need to wait outside.Dont go anywhere"
,,Too many people!!!,1.0,,Lined up for 45 mins to get in the gate then there was another line for the tram!! They are obviously selling way too many tickets for each session which is causing over crowding and a huge queues!! The 915 session was about to start and the 815 session hadn’t seen anything yet!
,,Great tram ride to get up close and personal with the animals. However had to queue 30 mins to get into the creatures of,4.0,,Great tram ride to get up close and personal with the animals. However had to queue 30 mins to get into the creatures of the night show
,,It was terrible .,1.0,,We waited for ages to line up no fans in waiting area then a half hour show then waiting for the train to take you around was horrendous. We felt we were the show in a cattle market . Do not go on weekend . They let in to many people kids were crying because were tired hot and even adults were starting to get grumpy . Worst tour I have been on in all of Asia
,,Night Safari Singapore Zoo,5.0,,A spectacular experience one should not miss. I live in Singapore and whenever we suggest visitors we should og they are a little reluctant. But it ends up being one of their best experiences here. And we don’t mind joining every time.
,,Great zoo,4.0,,"We had a great time. Enjoyed the night safari, the trains, the cool rooms. Food choice good and pricing not bad"
,,Good visit,4.0,,Good visit but long waiting time. The river safari and boat ride were better. The night safari is very well organized once you pass the que. Excellent place for children.
,,Go late at night!,5.0,,"Went to night safari tonight and arrived at 10pm. It was the last opportunity I'd have to go before leaving Singapore so I thought I'd go and have a look.

I missed the show which I'm sure would have been great, but the plus side was I walked straight onto the tram and had a whole row to myself. This meant I could move easily to see the animals on both sides.

I then went on some of the walking trails and by this time it was about 1045/11pm and very quiet, so it was easy to see the animals. Being alone I did get a little creeped out at times when the path was dark so maybe go with a friend!

The tram ride is very touristy but it was lots of fun!

A suggestion would be to perhaps lower the entry price after the shows are over. It may encourage more guests to come a bit later and ease the crowds.

Also I wish the shop had gifts from the main zoo too- I wanted to buy a red panda toy but they didn't have any :(

Overall, it was a unique experience and I'm glad I went!"
,,👍,5.0,,"Can be better! Abit too dark for photo taking. Love the tram ride, will be better is longer time given to take better picture. Friendly &helpful staff. My kids love it! Will come back soon!"
,,Greatest but room for fine tuning,4.0,,Will good if you can put your night show schedules and the start times of various language commentaries on the website so visitors can plan better.
,,Animal Delight,5.0,,The show with various animals is just outstanding and the ride in the tram so close to the open air animal enclosures makes you feel quite exhilarated because you are in proximity to the animals and not watching them through a cage.
,,overcrowded,3.0,,"it was saturday and we got 8:15pm slot because the 7:15 was already full.Then,we were waiting in the waiting area when we suddenly noticed people lining up for the 8:15 slot.It was 7:30pm then.So, even we had to stand in that long queue.We stood in the line for 1hr 30 min.The place was so over crowded.I suggest the management should not sell so many tickets if they ca't accommodate so many people.There was an artist performing stunts with fire at around 8:45pm which was difficult to see due to crowd and we could not see any shows as all of them were house full. At 9pm,we got a place in the tram.By that time we were already exhausted.The tram ride was,however,fun. We saw a lot of animals like lion,variety of deers,bear,flamingoes,hyenas,elephants,and many more.They were really close to the tram.
I will strongly suggest you all to avoid weekends and earlier slots like 7 and 8:15 ones and go for later slots to avoid crowds.
Also,trams rides would be better than walking on trails if you are not very adventurous."
,,The best zoo,5.0,,"Presence of a variety of animals.
The best thing is that the animals are free to move around and are disciplined.They do not cross their boundaries.
Do check out the Rainforest section to get a chance to be closer to animals and birds.The various shows are amazing ,so have a look at the schedules before hand.
Walking can be tiring,so book a combo ticket having tram ride included in your ticket.However,tram has a restricted route but it will drop u at one of the four stations from where u can walk all the way to different sections.
washrooms and drinking water facility is available at regular intervals.
There r many restaurants inside as well as outside the zoo.
Tip: if u hav already purchased tickets for night safari ,then u can book your time slot (for night safari) and get hard copies of your tickets BEFORE entering the zoo,at the kiosk near ticket window."
,,Good experience dont miss it,4.0,,Its better to book 9.15 pm show it will be less crowded... also avoid weekends and holidays ... we visited during weekends so we spent around 2 hours standing in the queue... cover the shows first then catch the tram... few good restaurants inside... it is 30 minutes from central and taxi will cost 20 SGD.
,,A great place for an evening out with the family,5.0,,"I don't know why we waited 2 years to go into this. It has a night event, and you can either walk or take a ride through a different part of the zoo. The animals are very active at night, so it is a different experience. I fully recommend it!"
,,A different experience,5.0,,"One of the most wonderful and genuine attractions in Singapore. Just imagine wandering in the dark in tiny alleys between the trees and watching the nocturne animals as they live in the wild. Really sensational.
N.B.: it may be wiser to have insect repellent, since it's very humid and an umbrella should be available in case it rains."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Probably the best zoo I've ever visited, they seem to care for the animals in a very good matter! We did the night safari with VIP tickets and a guide/pickup from Singapore city center to avoid queues. The attraction is very crowded during night hours, -1 for that."
,,Kudos to Sir John the Zoo Manager,5.0,,What a nice trip we had in Night Safari and we also met this awesome Zoo Manager Mr John Nascimento who was very accomodating and answered all our inquiries. Please give this guy a good commendation and I hope you keep employees like him as he gave us exceptional good quality service! Keep it up!
,,Really fun,5.0,,"I loved this night safari because you got to see cool animals, you could ride on the trams, which would give you information about each animal, and you could choose to walk on a trail too."
,,Unique!,5.0,,"I absolutely loved the Singapore Night Safari. It was a great opportunity to see animals in their natural habitat, awake and moving around. Tram ride included great commentary and there was also option to walk around afterwards and see fascinating creature show. Personal highlights were the binturongs, slow lorises, Asiatic and white lions, fishing cat and leopards."
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"We arrived in time to see the last fire show of the night and we thoroughly enjoyed watching the dancing. We wanted to see the Pets show as well but unfortunately the food stall we bought our food from took nearly half an hour to make two wraps so the show was full by the time we had finished eating. I suggest getting to the entrance for the Pet show 5 minutes before it opens to guarantee seats.

The actual safari was amazing, lots of big cats prowling around in the night and the tram drivers were providing lots of information. After the tram you can walk around the safari area and see all the animals that you can't see from the tram. The whole experience was good fun and it's interesting to see the animals in the night."
,,Night safari- waste of time,1.0,,"There is little to see at night as most nocturnal animals were asleep. There were a lot of gap fillers like deer in different shapes and sizes:) The most important learning as a European, was that the animal parts should not be used to treat medical conditions and that relying on chemistry might save the poor creatures from extinction!"
,,Convenient but Touristy,4.0,,"As it is very difficult to travel to Night Zoo by public transport we booked through Viator(RMG Tours) to night satari. Animals were majestic, cute and stunning.
Zoo itself is highly commercialised and has too much taped musak- style commentary.
Still worth a visit.
No flash photography."
,,Good tourist location in place of zoo,3.0,,"The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore.
It is located at an hour's distance from the main city. The first batch starts at 7pm.
The Night Safari currently houses over 2,500 animals representing over 130 species, of which 38% are threatened species. There are 4 walkable paths to check the animals.
Overall it is must watch if one is interested and fond of animals."
,,Holiday visit. But boring,3.0,,"I was quite excited to visit this with my kid but the experience waa very boring. Expensive and hence glad i bought the tickets online which were heavily discounted than at the counters.
Would have loved to do the trail though had a kid with me.
At least 4 to 5 times we got to see deers, 2 or 3 times hyenas and a tiger a lion an elephant a rhino and a giraffe a wild bull/ cow and some more deers. Was a bit boring an experience wth the kid since very low visibility. And you cannot take photos with a flash since its not allowed.
So take a night vision camera if you want pics.
The after show was a bit of a drag though fun for small kids"
,,Good experience but overcrowded,3.0,,"We enjoyed the Zoo's night Safari, but the queues to get onto the train were too long. We must have waited for 60mins from when we arrived to when we got on the train.

The train drove us around and we saw a variety of animals, mainly pigs and deer types. We did get to see the flamingo's which was good.

Since I was late and we had already waited so long, we didn't both with any of the shows since we needed to line up again.

We also had dinner afterwards at the Zoo, which was quite nice."
,,Night Zoo visit,5.0,,"We did a night zoo visit.
Highly organised and a fascinating experience.
After the tram ride around the zoo, we did the Wallaby Walk which also took us all the way around the zoo - but with more exposure to all exhibits/animal areas. Being at night, it was both well lit and a unique experience. It was also handicap-friendly.
Well worth the time and travel out to the zoo. We left the hotel at 6pm and did not return until around 10.30pm. A good outing!
We did this visit through a local travel company through our hotel - transport (to and from hotel) and entry. Certainly a the best option. To do a night visit on local transport would have been too hard to organise ourselves. The travel company cost and local travel/entry is cost neutral. Noting the timing, again, a single 'round trip' was the recommended way to go. Convenient, all-found and cost-efective."
,,Very disappointing,1.0,,Overpriced. Disappointing. A real tourist trap. Not worth it. The animals look sedated. And hardly any.
,,Night Safari - Not worth it,3.0,,"We took the long, I mean very long ride to Singapore Zoo. I think it is a very nice zoo, but I think it is probably worth visiting during the day since at night, with the darkness, the animals may be sleeping. Also, can't use flash for photography, which can be an issue at night."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Really amazing experience, first we visited amazing creatures of night show, host was amazing, we took tram ride instead of long walk. After tram ride you can still take walk and explore as long as u want. But still I dont know how they managed to keep all animals in designated place which one can easily make out by there behavior. But still an amazing experience to see wild animals without any guard or fencing."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Huge crowds on a Thursday but well worth the wait. Grab something to eat before you go in and then head for the ""Creatures of the Night "" show st 7.30pm. Great show. Once it finishes get on a tractor trailer to take a 40 minute ride around the night zoo seeing animals in their native habitats. Some animals are free roaming and will be right beside your trailer. Definitely a top tourist must see in Singapore."
,,Overcrowded & expensive,3.0,,"Way too many people, the queues are super long and its hard to get into any of the shows unless you are willing to wait a long time."
,,Something different,5.0,,"Most zoos are done in the day time, so this one's different you can take the bus that looks like a train thingy, or simply walk thru. There was an animal show which was good. There are restaurants inside with buffet or ala carte option. Over all because there isn't a cage as such for animal, feels like a very close experience."
,,"Great experience, different from other attraction",4.0,,"Customer service is very good, attraction is very good. Need to improve the queuing system at the entrance to prevent long one line queue. So many people jump the queue as well."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"Very expensive, with teenagers charged at adult prices. Should have a family pass. Recommend walking after tram tour as see more when walking"
,,Worth going,5.0,,"Night safari is prolly one of my favourite places to go. It never fails to fascinate me each time, from the night animal show to the tram ride. A good place for family, friends and even for a date. Wear light clothing and comfortable shoes as it can get pretty humid and there is a lot of walking in the park.

This is definitely a place to recommend for tourist as well as locals.

Get the ticket combos, it’s definitely cheaper."
,,good service for this trip,5.0,,"my mun needs wheelchair to assistance， term & night show also offer disablity assistance, includes toilets, good experience for my family everyone."
,,Wonderful way to experience the zoo and escape the heat!,4.0,,We took our 2 kids (6 and 9) to the 7pm session - it was wonderful and great to experience the zoo at night (and wonderful to be outside and it not be so hot!) The lines for the tram were very long so we decided to walk the entire circuit instead - it was fabulous and easily walkable. Unfortunately the Lion path was closed which was a shame as we could hear the Lion calling/roaring. Many rude other tourists pushed in front of our kids at some of the exhibits making it difficult to see some of the crowded ones (like the tiger) but this was not the fault of the zoo itself
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Excellent, all the family had a great time, the train ride was great and the cue was not to long a wait. Was a great experience"
,,Good time!,4.0,,"My best friend loved watching animals he didn't usually see while I was not particularly excited. Nevertheless we had a great time together. The animals are fun/cute/awesome to watch even thought I wasn't an animal fan. The night animal show was fantastic as well. The landscapes were beautiful and relaxing to walk past.

However, the park can be too dark for you to clearly see the animals. Bring your night vision goggles if you have them!"
,,Truly a wonderful place,5.0,,Children really have a nice weekend and al friendly staff from the start right until the very end..looking forward for the next visit..
,,amazing to get so close to nature,5.0,,"We booked the vip tram ride and the night safari through Viator before we arrived into Singapore to make sure we avoided the queues. It was fantastic getting so close to the animals. The 4 walking trails were great, especially getting to see the Pangolin up close. Great experience."
,,Overcrowded money making machine,1.0,,Far too many people. Unable to get into any of the shows. Hi during the day to see the animals don’t bother going at night it’s a rip off.
,,Singapore zoo,5.0,,Excellent time. Lots of excellent displays. Zoo had lots of animals that had excellent view points. Really enjoyed night safari.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,If you are looking for a truly unique zoo experience you should try the Singapore Zoo Night Safari. Loved the tram ride & even with the large crowds everything moved quickly & smoothly. Really well run & worthwhile experience.
,,never fails to amaze,5.0,,this is my 3rd visit to the park but it still amazes me. the effort put in by the park to protect endangered animals and to educate the people is truly commendable.
,,A night to remember,5.0,,"If you only do one thing when you visit Singapore... seriously consider making it a trip to the Night Safari.
We went on a Wednesday at 7:30 and it almost felt like we were the only ones there.
All three of our children loved it (13,17 and 19)."
,,Nothing much to see,2.0,,Boring and short night show. Uninteresting walking animal trails. Less information about the animal intrduction
,,Great attraction,4.0,,Really interesting to see the animals at night particulay as they are more active . Was lovely at sundown however there would probably be fewer crowds in the later sessions.
,,Great new experience,4.0,,"A great new zoo experience. Most animals could be seen, but there is obviously some luck involved in a concept like this. The tram ride is an essential element of the visit, but queues were very long. We pre-booked a guided tour through Tour East, which meant no waiting, and that also solved any transport issues because hotel transfers were all included. Highly recommend this activity, and pre-booking a tour is well worth considering."
,,Night zoo visit.,5.0,,The night zoo visit was excellent value and well recommended. It is a very well run event which caters for all ages and as you are in a vehicle it saves walking and you get to see everything at a pace that enables this to happen!
,,Over subscribed,1.0,,"After reading the awful reviews about the ticketing and queue system on TA, I contacted them THREE MONTHS in advance to book any of the four options they have that allow you to avoid the queue e.g. the night safari tour with dinner. These options are $180SD + but we were willing to pay. For the 10 days we are in Singapore they are completely booked out....and that’s three months in advance! Their emails were not helpful at all simply telling me to buy a standard ticket and aim to queue up 15 mins early. From reading these reviews that sounds like a definitely recipe for failure!

Poor service, poor booking management and significant issues with managing demand as well. Disappointing."
,,Interesting Attraction for Wildlife Lovers,5.0,,"The Night Safari is an interesting attraction for family and friends. We chose the 8.30pm time slot and it was really crowded. Lines were long at the entrance even though we started queuing at 7.30pm. Expect long lines entering and for the tram ride. I’ll recommend exploring on foot around the attraction before catching the shows and lastly hop on to the tram. A fan and water bottles are a must for those who can’t take Singapore’s humidity and temperature. Overall an enjoyable attraction to visit especially if you’re keen to learn more about animals and their nightly habits! If you’re bringing young children, do make sure they’re patient enough and have the energy to wait in line."
,,The best safari for sure!,5.0,,Great adventure for our entirely family from 7years olds to 70 years olds. Staff were super friendly and efficient! Will definitely come back!
,,Worth a try,4.0,,Good experience except for the long queues. It's definitely very different from visiting the Zoo in the day. Better could be done to make the q more tolerable eg more fans to cool off the sweltering heat and entertainment for children.
,,A must to visit,4.0,,Isn’t safari as an amazing experience. Make sure you walk around the trails for better viewing of more animals and not just sit on the tram. Anyway I think it’s little over priced!
,,Walk!,5.0,,"I suspect that some of the negative reviews for this attraction relate to the crowds and queues. We came to the night zoo many years ago and walked on the trails and did not use the trams or visit the show. We did the same this time and had a fantastic experience. By walking you get more peace and quiet and so see a lot more. We had very good views of otters playing (so close they made eye contact) several big cats (tiger, leopard, lions, and several more). This is a zoo not a safari, but the animals seem fairly relaxed and are very visible. My advice is to ignore the trams and the show and the crowds and to make the effort to walk and you will be very well rewarded. The trails are good, well marked and easy to follow even in the dark. We went for the 9.15 entrance time and had no problems with queues at all. It was busy so perhaps those taking a different approach would have a different experience"
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"Good place to spend an evening, a new experience, good variety of animals, lot of food options, good n helpful staff"
,,Night Time at the Zoo,5.0,,"Did this as part of our Zoo package, did the 7:15 pm spot as we had the full day with Zoo & River Safari. If you are going to do this you may not want to go very early to the zoo itself. This was a very good way to see the animals at night while they are feeding. Wonderful show and you are out of the daytime heat. Just relax and enjoy the ride.

The Food cost is much higher at the zoo then any place in Singapore."
,,Great night safari,4.0,,"Our tour guide Robin was very happy, explained the tour in detail.
We opted for the evening buffet aswell, food was fresh, hot & plenty of choice. Everything tasted lovely. Then onto the tram to see the animals. Much nicer in the evenings , when it is cooler. After the tram optional to do a walk or watch the animal show, we chose the walk to be able to see animals up close & take photos. Lovely evening trip!"
,,Evening animal encounters,5.0,,"We visited the Singapore Night Zoo with our children and grandchildren. The food options available before the visit were excellent with great choice and good value. The queues arrived early but were efficiently moved to the tram rides and crowds dissipated rapidly. The tram ride was informative and a great way to see the zoo. We then walked through many of the areas, a little nerve wracking when it appears there is nothing between you and the animals! Overall a great night educational and exciting."
,,How fantastic was this!!,5.0,,"Well, we had 3 x families as a group undertake this challenge called the Singapore Zoo Night Safari. 5A and 7C. It was so much fun. Started by taking the tram ride to get our bearings. Amazing how many animals are awake..quiet frankly I'd be back in our room having a glass of vino and watching crappy hotel TV..why these animals were awake is beyond me! The tram tour is very informative and gets you right around the zoo. Then you just jump on a trail and do the lap of honour. You get to see all sorts of nocturnal and non nocturnal..""oh i'm so tired"" animals like the elephants, tigers etc. It is well laid out, plenty of room to explore and in typical Singa style very very organised, clean and safe.
Bucket list when next in Singapore!"
,,Fantastic Experience!,5.0,,"After reading some of reviews on trip advisor it put me off visiting the night safari on previous trips but our recent trip we decided to give it a go. Expecting the worse due to reviews but was pleasantly surprised!

As the queues were long and after the reviews I read, I decided it would be worthwhile paying the extra $10 pp to skip the line to enter and for the tram. It was definitely worth it and enhanced the experience. With us the only ones in priority line we got shown to front of tram immediately which is for priority passengers.

The shows were wonderful and it was great seeing the animals at night. I do recommend pre booking your time slot as we got there wanting 8.30 entry and arrived at 8 but it was sold out so had to purchase 9.30. Having priority pass though we were let in at 9pm ahead of everyone else.

We all thoroughly enjoyed it and the taxi wait after was only 15 minutes even though long queue."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Did the night safari here and it was simply amazing. Elephants were got so close to us that i thought it was statue! If you have kids though, don't do the night safari as it was kind of scary."
,,Amazing!,4.0,,So exciting for the children to see the animals out and about at night... felt like a real Safari on the trains. Take bug spray! I felt the price of the photos taken at the start and the food on site were overpriced but that doesn't affect the rating of the activity.
,,Night Safari,1.0,,"We had a show booked at 8:15pm, got cancelled and missed out on the 9:30 show because of the long line"
,,Safari So Good,5.0,,We went with four adults and three kids. We all had an amazing time. I would thoroughly recommend this experience to all regardless of children or not. We went to the 7.15pm session and didn't leave the zoo until after 10pm if you have kids and you want to do the walking trails as well as the tram I suggest you book the 7.15pm session (the earliest one)
,,Tiring Queue,3.0,,"We went to first batch of Night safari and visited the fire show, after the show we have been on the queue for quite long and by the time we board the tram all are exhausted. The queue is too big and suffocating. I suggest to take nature walking trial instead of tram where one can see lot of animals. When you go in tram, the sightseeing is limited to key attraction and you may not see much."
,,Different kind of experience,3.0,,"It's nice to go at night, it's not as hot, you see interesting animals that you wouldn't normally see and the atmosphere is just different.
However, the major let down was the endless queuing. You queue to get in (20 mins) then to find out there is another one waiting for you if you want to take the bus ride around the zoo! We chose to walk, it's not a huge walk and it was pleasant, especially getting to walk through all these tropical paths in anticipation of the next creature round the bend. We missed out on the elephants and a few other animals as this seemed only accessible by bus - which was still queuing! Oh and not forgetting the queue to get a taxi/bus at the end!"
,,Educational but a bit short,4.0,,"It's a very good place to check out for a evening event. there are several shows I think one hour apart from each, the earliest start at 7:30. You ride on a train and they take you around the zoo seeing animal in separated habitat.

Don't brother with your cell phone camera, the place is very dark, you will need very good camera to take any picture here. beside the train ride, you can also elect to talk on one of the walk trial which you will get to see the same animals.

The zoo has a very large food court and very good souvenir shop, so you will be able to spend some time here if you wish."
,,Not worth the effort,1.0,,"After all the serpentine queues, it's quite a disappointment. Bored sleepy animals barely visible in dim light. I guess the concept itself is flawed. Avoidable"
,,Great experience - kids loved it,5.0,,"Did the night safari as a family. Took the advice of previous posts and did the walk trails first rather than queue for the tram - a real time saver! Did the three walk trails, watched the creatures show and then walked straight onto the tram with no waiting. Would recommend doing the tram as takes you to different areas than the walk trails."
,,I can't go inside to night safari,1.0,,I waited saex shuttle bus to go to the night safari. But the bus didn't show up and i can't go to the night safari in enter time. I ruined one day of my singapore trip.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Most animals that sleep during the day are in their element here. Plus with all the gorgeous natural foliage you start to feel like this is what the jungle would have been like before the city of Singapore was built up. One of my favorite parts of Singapore
,,Well worth the travel,5.0,,"We visited the night safari and were pleasantly surprised.

We were disappointed that we could only get the 9.00pm tickets but in the end that was to our advantage because the 800 group was so large we were standing behind them in the line for the tram ride but we had got there an hour later.

You can buy food there but it was really pricey.

The tram ride was great but being able to walk around was wonderful. We stayed for a couple of hours to see all the areas on foot. You could use a pram/stroller here if you needed too.

We travelled by train and bus to the night safari for 3sgd but came back by taxi for about 45sgd to the city because we were so late.

We bought our tickets using the ""handy"" which our hotel offered for a great discount."
,,Enjoyable family putjng,4.0,,"Our family of four enjoyed the night safari. However our guide spoke to us as if we were 4 years old which drove us all crazy! The night tram ride itself was fun and a new experience. The buffet dinner is great value and very tasty.
I think I would definitely recommend to families especially with younger children who would find it exciting."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Never visit zoo in the night. This is the first time to stare at wildlife under the moonlight. Sitting in the coach, lion was laying on the stone right there. unforgettable experience in my life and I will recommend the night safari to my friends who are going to have a holiday in Singapore right now."
,,Animals were sad,3.0,,Having travelled to many animal parks around the world my own personal perception was that the animals in the park were either stressed or bored stiff. Whilst not caged their space is still too small for roaming and they were not happy animals. The elephants and Rhinos especially. Human facilities were excellent.
,,A different experience,4.0,,Very interesting to see animals during the night. Had a good time with my friends. But didn't see the details clearly from a far distance.
,,Couldn't attend Creatures of the Night Show/ショーが見れませんでした,1.0,,"日本語下。

First time to visit. We booked 20:15 one and got there around 19:45, however, the waiting line for the tram was already super long, and it took us 45 mins to start the tour.
The worst part is that we couldn't attend the Creatures of the Night Show.
Our tram tour finished just before 21:30, and we rush to the show, but the staff said the show is full and we couldn't attend.
This is VERY unprofessional.
A woman, who also couldn't attend the show, was claiming that why they sell so many ticket and many people cannot enjoy the show even though the ticket price is same.
That is so true.
We paid same price, and some could enjoy the show and some couldn't.
21:30 is the last show of the weekday.

I went there with my guest who came over from Japan and she was VERY disappointed. Me too.
This is what they should announce more clearly.
If you want to enjoy the show, go there by 19:00, and enjoy show from 19:30, then get on the tram tour from 20:15, and enjoy walking trail till the safari is closed.
This is only the way you can enjoy all of the safari. I hope you don't waste money.

日本から来た友人と初めて訪れましたが、ハイライトの一つであるショーが満席で見られませんでした。

初めてだったので色々調べたのですが、よくわからず、ひとまず20:15分のチケットとやらを予約し、19:45に現地に到着、スタッフに言われるまま、トラムの列に並びましたが、乗り込めたのは20:30を過ぎた頃でした。
それ自体は楽しめたのですが、その日の最後のショーが21:30からで、その直前にトラムによるツアーが終了したので、ショーに急いだのですが、入り口で何やら人が揉めています。
どうやら席が満席なので入れない、ということでした。
海外から来たと思われる白人の女性がスタッフに詰め寄っていましたが、同じ金額を払って、しかも時間通りにツアーに参加しているにも関わらず、ショーが満席で見えない、しかもその回で終わりとのことで、「ショーの分のお金を返金しろ」という彼女の主張はあながち間違ってないような気もしました。
ショーが見られなかったせいで、せっかくのナイトサファリでの経験が残念なものになりました。

トラム以外にも徒歩で回るっコースも別にあるため、ショー、トラム、徒歩のすべてを楽しむためには19時には現地に遅くとも着いて、19:30からのショーを見た後に20:15からのトラムにのり、その後、徒歩のコースを楽しむのが良いかと思います。"
,,Pleasant Experience At The Night Safari,5.0,,"When we arrived at the Night Safari, we were lucky to prepare ourselves with the entry into the zoo. Even though it was a week night on Thursday, it was super packed with visitors! So, ensure to print all your bookings and e-tickets to ensure a smooth entry through the VIP/Member entrance. That saves my family of 7 pax a lot of hassle!

As for transport to the Night Safari, just take a maxi / taxi to and fro, easy peasy. Do not book yourselves through a trace agent, in our case through (SAEX) as the whole transport was late and even though we paid for a to and fro journey ride, we only managed to get to but not return to our hotel. The management of SAEX let other customers into our ride instead. That was the only dissatisfaction we had that night. Other than that, everything from the amphitheater viewing & tram ride were awesome!!! Definitely worth the visit. Oh, the shopping at the souvenir shop was great too! Thank you!"
,,A must visit to Singapore Zoo,5.0,,We went to the zoo in the evening. This was very exciting as we had a buffet dinner at first then we boarded an open train that took us around the zoo with narration. The various animial pens were all lit up so that you could see all of the animals easily. Their pens are very well set up just like them being out in the wild. After the train ride we were able to walk around as well. This is definitely a must
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"This is a must do when in Singapore for the young and old alike. Great family outing. A fire show begins the evening, followed by a ""live"" animal show and ending with a guided train at night around the zoo."
,,A real disappointment,3.0,,"Where to start, or guide on the , Christopher was the best, talking about the Singapore people and their culture on the way out to the zoo, on arriving he directed us to our tables for dinner, which was pretty good, as we were running late due to peak hour traffic, you can never escape traffic problems. After dinner we set out on the night safari, as we were told by friends and others to experience the zoo at night. Well that where it ceased to be, it’s was a beautiful night, cool and calming driving slowly though the enclosures, but the animals were either asleep or at the back of their enclosures. A few deer grazing and a hyena looking at us intently, for food I think, a couple of African pigs, Tiger that was asleep and a lioness that was not interested at all. My choice, the zoo during the day, is your beat option. But I’m only one of many, and everyone has their likes and dislikes, and this is only my 2nd really critical review I’ve done, but there were others on the tour that thought the same. I will leave it up to you."
,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,"We arrived later than our allotted time and were very graciously allowed through straight away. We took other recommendations and did the walking paths first - very well laid out easy to follow the circuit. Also took the train after to see the other animals. Enjoyed by all - lovely at night, bit cooler and very enjoyable."
,,Unfair Queue system for the Animal Show at Amphitheatre,2.0,,"Bought tickets for earliest entry at 715pm cos my young kids can't keep awake late. Entered before first animal show starts at 730 but announcement came that amphitheatre is already full, patrons are advised to q for next show (830pm) half hour in advance. We decided to just hang around as the q for the tram is too long to be back by 8. Even though we started queuing before 8pm and were the 4th in the q, the theatre was already 80% full when ushers let us in. Big tour groups simply do not q in the same line and were allowed in whizzing past all of us in the long q! Needless to say all prime view seats were taken when we were finally let in at 825pm. Disappointed that non tour group visitors were penalised for standing in the q early. Plans for the night were set back by more than an hour because we want to catch the show. Eventually we did not get to take the tram too due to the long q. We decided to walk the trail which takes at least an hour to fully complete it without rushing through. By that time, even though there's little q for the tram, kids were too exhausted to continue. So plan your entry super early if you are unable to stay late. I don't know how that's possible since entry is only at 715pm. Perhaps the q to enter at 715 starts way before that! Good luck."
,,Night Safari at Singapore Zoo,5.0,,"We arrived at 7.15pm when it was very busy so rather than queue for the tram we did the walks first - the walks are well laid out and the wardens very knowledgeable. We then had food, there is a good selection at the entrance and then queued for the tram. We waited for 20 minutes at around 8.45pm, but I noticed that there was not much of a queue behind us - if you don't have young kids, then I recommend you time your arrival at the zoo for a later slot. The tram was informative and we did see a different side to the zoo so it was worth doing both."
,,A saturdate for us,5.0,,"Great animal show, great close contact with the wild. Kudos to a safari in an urban city. A great time we had."
,,Uniquely enjoyable,4.0,,Great experience seeing the animals so close and no cages...except for certain species. Enjoyed the tram and would also recommend the walking trails...
,,Too much crowded,3.0,,"Long Qs, crowded. Need better management of visitors for taking care of their comforts. can include more animals form all the regions to have a global view."
,,Night Safari ...great fun,4.0,,"A good experience, especially when combined with one of the shows afterwards. The price is definitely worth it, even though like just about everything in Singapore, it is not inexpensive."
,,Beautiful Enjoyable Night Experience,5.0,,We have been to night safari for few times. Each time it excites us with the up close experience with the nocturnal animals in the team ride. Followed by the walking trails.
,,Over crowded and under staffed,1.0,,"Long waiting on the line to get in. Once we got through the gate, long wait to get on the trams. Creature of the night show was average. Wasn't worth it."
,,Great night but prepare to be out late,5.0,,Had a great time with daughters aged 10 and 12. Very busy when we first entered so ask for the walking tour then return later for the show and to hop on the tram. You see more on the walking trail than on the tram.
,,Tram ride,5.0,,The stagf are friendly and helpful. Night tram ride at the deeper end of amazon forest air are windy and refreshing. Tram seem like riding in water at tiger den add to the realistic jungle effect. Only the distance it is too short.
,,The safari tram is great.,4.0,,"Went on a weeknight and had no bother. The show was quite good - hot, bring a fan. Walking trails are also fine but the safari tram is great. We walked straight into one at 8:30pm and seeing the animals up close and sometimes sharing the enclosure was excellent - nice cool breeze as it drives around."
,,Many animals,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the night safari. Yes, there are a lot of people. We saw a lot of animals and were on the tram at about 8 pm. Even if you have a ticket you have to wait in line. It is hard to get good photos as you are not allowed to use a flash. Many of the animals were right next to the tram though and we saw all of them.

There are many restaurants that open at 530 pm and there is also a short ""show"" about the night animals that is cute (but not wheelchair accessible). It is great show for kids.

Both taxis and buses are available for transport to and from your hotel, but the night taxi rate (peak rate) is almost double that of the day rate, so be prepared. You can bring in bottled water and bags."
,,night zoo,5.0,,the night zoo is a must and do an orgainised trip where tansport dinner and entry is included it is a good deal .
,,Go to Night At The Zoo for a treat,4.0,,It's hot and sunny in Singapore but it cools off at night. The animals are shown in lighting that mimics moonlight. They have a show. There's food (we ate dinner there). Perfect for grown-ups like us or the family with young kids. It was very peaceful at night as well.
,,Huge queues even with hourly booking system,2.0,,"We booked tickets months in advance for the night safari and were still at the back of lines of over 500 people per hour trying just to get into the zoo. Then the same lines of 100's of people trying to get onto trams to go around the zoo. We ate hastily so we could get in only to wait and wait. I cannot imagine how this place would cater for an emergency with the 1000's of people packed into the spaces. Hot even at night made worse by crowding and pushing. Although outside, wild animals are in fairly small spaces and not roaming like in a wildlife park as I mistakenly thought. Spotlights on them so you can see - this cannot be kind. Avoid."
,,Quiet wildlife,3.0,,"This was our second visit but first time with children. Didn't really enjoy it that much probably due to the face that we've been to many zoos and wildlife parks in England since we visited here first time.
Many animals were asleep and seemed to be winding down."
,,Adventure in the dark,4.0,,Night Safari was a great evening adventure in Singapore. The live show was informative and entertaining. The tram ride was also interesting and surprising with some stunning animals. The earliest sessions are recommended for people who prefer not to stay out too late.
,,Over rated,3.0,,"The facilities were top notch,including the crowd control,service personnel etc. But the night ride was short and one could site were few wild life and they were way too far. Considering the price,not exactly bang for the buck."
,,Worth a visit but plan ahead!,4.0,,"We bought our tickets online but didn't realize they only let you in at the allotted times! Just missed the 8.15 so had to wait nearly an hour to get in at 9.15, still crowds of people! Didn't think we'd worry about the show so set off on the walk trails. Great to see the animals in their natural habitat. But unfortunately you can't see any of the big animals unless you are on the tram ride. Did the tram ride at the end when the crowds had died down, worth waiting rather than standing in queues! A fun experience but plan ahead and enjoy the smaller animals without expecting to see too much!"
,,Worth it,5.0,,"We went on the Night Safari with 2 children, had a brilliant time, tram ride was nice but some of the animals were too far and was very dark so couldn’t see much. The night show was brilliant, it’s amazing how you can train animals."

,,Excellent experience,5.0,,This place is simply awesome. The night safari ride is excellent and you get to see various animals in their natural habitat. A wonderful and must experience night time.
,,Quiet wildlife,3.0,,"This was our second visit but first time with children. Didn't really enjoy it that much probably due to the face that we've been to many zoos and wildlife parks in England since we visited here first time.
Many animals were asleep and seemed to be winding down."
,,Adventure in the dark,4.0,,Night Safari was a great evening adventure in Singapore. The live show was informative and entertaining. The tram ride was also interesting and surprising with some stunning animals. The earliest sessions are recommended for people who prefer not to stay out too late.
,,Over rated,3.0,,"The facilities were top notch,including the crowd control,service personnel etc. But the night ride was short and one could site were few wild life and they were way too far. Considering the price,not exactly bang for the buck."

,,Great for adults and kids,4.0,,"Great night out to watch the amazing wildlife , busy night out there make sure you get there early to book the first show , to travel around . They put on a great live show with great enthusiasm from staff and handlers only criticism is that they should not let people leave while the show is still in progress . Great night and we did not have kids ."
,,Great Zoo,4.0,,"Had a great time and were lucky enough to see nearly all the animals. We did the River Safari in the afternoon which was good. Had tea at the restaurants/food court which is at the entrance to the night safari, food was really good and then went into the night safari which opened a little later. The whole Zoological area is very well set up with the actual Singapore Zoo, above two safaris and eateries. We used a taxi to get there and back which we found the easiest. It only cost about 20SGD from the city...."
,,Don’t take the late night Safari,3.0,,"Booked for the 22:15 safari as we figured it would be less busy. It was, but we didn’t expect that because it was quiet, they would just rush around as quickly as they could and try to close early!
The train didn’t stop at any of the normal places where you can get off and walk around some of the smaller enclosures. Result - the trip was done in 30 minutes and we felt short-changed. The previous time we had a much better experience visiting at 21:15 so I would urge people to go a bit earlier and not wait for the last trips."
,,Unusual Zoo Experience,5.0,,Wonderful night walk. Animals are closer then day zoo. Must take the tram ride. The commentary during tram ride is informative. Spent about 2.5 to 3 hours there. Try to avoid peak period as tram ride has long queue. Consider taking tram ride toward the end of your tour to avoid queuing.
,,a unique experience,5.0,,buy the tickets from klook or go voyaging to save money. good experience. the animal show is interesting. the place is fun for children. we had a tapir walk right next to our ride on the tram.
,,"Wonderful, Out of the world experience",5.0,,"I would say, I was not much interested in this activity initially, but anyhow went for it and I am happy with my decision. We were taken on a trail and then there were several points where we were allowed to get down and walk on our own. It was dark and we were instructed not to use flashlights as it would disturb animals. It was an out of the world experience, as soon the trail started I could see Tigers sitting and relaxing on a small mountain, my Goodness this was the first time I was witnessing a tiger from such a small distance. We passed a group of beers, Barasinghas, and a lot more animals whom we could see from the naked eye. Soon we got down of the trail and found ourselves near to the group of Hyenas, it was frightening but this is what adventure is all about. Go for this activity as you do not get to see Orangutans, elephants, polar bear, Penguins, Giraffe, Zebra, White Rhinoceros, Cheetah, African Painted Dog, and Meerkat every day."
,,A great tour,5.0,,This is a must visit place for all who go to Singapore. Really an educational tour for the children. You can get a good sense of jungle in the dark while you go through the tram ride. The night show by the creatures are also impressive.
,,Quite unique experience,4.0,,It was very busy and lines took too long to clear but overall it was worth the unique experience - however not very well set up for walking as some area just too dark and unclear directions. It is worth a one off visit but best to choose the quieter nights if that exists
,,Great experience,5.0,,"We visited Night Safari as part of the tour engaged with our Hotel (Furama Riverfront). The tour started on time and we were able to skip the lines because of the tickets provided by tour guide in advance. Since our time at the Safari was limited, we chose to do the tram - that takes folks around the park with a recorded commentary to point out at animal stations, information and activities. We also chose to do a night walk to the Lion's Den and other animals on the a particular section.
All in all a great concept to watch animals closely and learn about their habits (especially those of the nocturnal ones)."
,,Zoo Time,4.0,,"Neat, compact Zoo with large range of animals. Night Safari is well worth the participation. Great place for a day out for families and is a very popular spot , and well catered for tourists."
,,Feels like Jurassic park,5.0,,I loved this tour. Go on the trams passing animals at arms length. Many different walks to go on and we had a terrific guide with Buffalo tours. Great food available too.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Already taking in consideration that the animals are only displayed to humans for 6 hours is positive for that place.
However what really is nice, that a lot of enclosures are huge that you are not allowed to go there by foot. Of course you'll sometimes have a platform where you can see part of the enclosure, but never guaranteed that you'll see an animal.
The trains which drive you through the enclosures are very relaxing, however you cannot decide how long you'll be in a certain enclosure.
The idea of the night Safari is very nice, because you really can see a lot of animals being active which you usually see sleeping during day time in other zoos."
,,Family Visit,5.0,,We brought our children (ages 6 to 12) to the night safari. It was an excellent way to spend our weekend. We had a different perspective of the zoo at night. The Train ride was quite fun. We could get out at specific places to have glimpses of the noctural animals. Quite an adventure for the kids to visit the zoo in the night. We had fun. Glad we made the trip.
,,Unique zoo experience,4.0,,"We have been to the night safari twice now- 10 years apart, and it was great both times. It is unique to see the nocturnal animals that are common at other zoos actually up and active during the night. The trans that take you around are comfortable and pretty good, though the lineups can be very long (booking tickets through a tour company can help jump some of these lines). During the tram rides some of the animals are still a bit difficult to see- but it is night time after all. We enjoyed the walking paths that let you explore a t your own pace.
The bat echclosure is a great way to to be able to see large fruit bats right up close, with nothing between you.
You don't need to spend a ton of time here to experience it either- 2-3 hours is enough to cover most of the enclosures.
Really good ice cream is sold at the entrance too!"
,,Go There,5.0,,"Really it is worth a look, its nothing unbelievable though it was different, I had never been or heard of a night safari until I went and had a look, it was something different and exciting to look forward to, well work a look, If you have never seen a night safari before then have a look as it was pretty good"
,,A very different perspective,4.0,,"We really enjoyed seeing the animals in their nocturnal activities as this gave a completely different perspective.
But some of the animals appeared stressed pacing up and down. Always feel uneasy about zoos and how well they balance breeding programmes with profit
The dining was great, the queue for the trams less so and we could have managed our time better by doing a walk before taking the tram tour"
,,Day visit much better,2.0,,"The Singapore Zoo is amazing. I visited during day and night. Just don't think the night experience adds much. There's a very long (~1 hour) wait for the tram. And though the ride is nice, not worth all the hassle to get there and back.
I much prefer the day visit."
,,very nice but management can be improved,4.0,,"this is next to the zoo.
first you queue outside, and no one checks what timing you purchsed tickets for, which defeats the purpose of buying tickets per time slot, then you queue inside at the tram station. Trams are 2 bogey units which then slowly take you around with several warnings not to enable flash photo, but still some dumb folks dont get it and continue using flash - the driver then stopped the vehicle and gave an earful. without flash and a moving tram, you cannot get any good photos so enjoy the commentary and the animals. we saw tons of them, pretty much all the animals talked about in commentary.
the show is every 30min i believe so you can do either safari or show first. there is also a walkway trail
things to improve:
1. zoo closes by 5.30/6 and 1st night safari is after 7, they should have some thing for folks who want to do both.
2. pls check the time slot rather than allowing anyone with ticket to enter, this will even out the crowd
3. put some benches on the wait for tram, so elderly and kids can relax while waiting
4. this is not airspace with aircrafts that one tram needs to wait for 5-10 min after previous one, am sure the drivers know how to maintain the distance, so dont let the queued people wait long times in queue or on cart for their turn."
,,A couple of points of interest,4.0,,"Did the Zoo and Night safari 59SGD parkhopper.
The Zoo was great. All so nice and clearly. Did not managed to get the first flight for the night safari so I had to wait a while between the two attractions. One mistake I did was not to eat at the zoo, where the meals were around 10SGD. At the night safari all the meals started from 20SGD. And the asian food buffet would have been 45SGD.
One thing I learned were that when entering the park, after queing to que for the entrance, that do the walking trails first. It took me on hour without a rush to do all four of them. After that I did the tram to see the animals that could not be seen from the trails."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"We enjoyed the Night Safari, but a couple of comments. A little confused that the commentary focussed on Saving the Planet while sitting in a rear car where we choked with fumes from the diesel vehicle used during the Safari. Also it was a shame other passengers did not observe the request to be quiet and not use flash. The people behind us talked throughout and it was difficult to hear the official commentary, but luckily they did not scare off any animals."
,,Close up and Personal,5.0,,"We took the personal tram tour which was for up to7 people we werereally fortunate and it was just the twoof us and our own personal guide. The experience was fantastic every animalwe were expecting to see we saw and the time taken to inform us about these animals was truly first class. We spent almost 4 hours wanering around and been driven through the area.I twas a truly remarkable experience, it is more expensive than the normal tram tour but the advantage is that there isno queing nowaiting in line and the fact that you can stop and spend timelooking and learning about the animals. I would recommend this additional outlay for the addedexpeience yu etfrom it. First class service and a brilliant experience"
,,Safari under moonlight,5.0,,"This safari is on the east of the city outskirts so takes about 30 min from central district, Jurong bird park is being moved here and hence construction is in full swing and expected in about 2 years. At Sep there was no mosquito menace and the sunset is at 7 pm. Our tram starts at 7.15 or so and we see all tropical animals in artificial moonlight, they are all 10 m to 100 m away from tram and minding their own business which is quite unusual, looks like they are well accustomed to humans. On the way there are guards too on the trail and some told there is a moat in between the animals and the road, but we couldn't see it or verify it. It's quite dark but the animals are in artificial moonlight. There is even a lion here. Other animals are elephants, rhinoceros, hippo, deer, pigs, bison, giraffe etc. There is an audio commentary all through the ride which is very informative. Once the show is over there is a performance at 8.40, so people can either have dinner and join or finish and have dinner. All cuisines are available and the minimum is 15 dollars per person. There is no Mac D or, toast king etc here and hence the food is costly."
,,Sooooo Busy but fun,3.0,,"Be careful with online bookings! Skip the line Doesn’t mean skip the line to get on the tram!!

It means you should be able to get your ticket quicker - unless everyone has done the same and you have to queue for 40minutes anyway!

I then paid an extra 20SGP to get “Priority Boarding” - to skip the huge queue onto the trams!!

The tram ride was good saw a couple of animals I’ve not seen at zoos before. The animals aren’t in cages but more like open fronted pens, they seem to do a lot towards conservation.

The creatures of the night show was enjoyable probably heavily aimed at kids.

By this point we were tired so didn’t do the trail walks."
,,Waste of Money,1.0,,"We decided to do the Singapore Zoo Night Safari. We arrived in plenty of time but so did bus, after bus, after bus of other tourists. There was not hundreds but thousands of people. We were made to line up in massive cattle runs and stood waiting to get on the safari trains. It was EXTREMELY hot and raining off and on. We waited over an hour and were still a long way from getting in. Having had recent knee surgery it was becoming very uncomfortable to continue standing so we decided to cut our $90 loss and leave. We were asking to be let out but the lady insisted we speak to a manager. By this stage we had been at the zoo for 3+ hours. The manager offered to get us on the next train which was great. We boarded with great anticipation only to find there was no animals. Everything was either asleep or hiding from the rain, plus it was SO dark in there you couldn’t see anything. VERY disappointing.
Would not recommend doing the night safari at all!!!"
,,Do the walking trails- much better than tram ride!,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the Night Safari, we avoided the queues and saw loads of animals- here are our top tips on how to do this:
Go mid week
Book your tickets online in advance
When you arrive don't join the queue for the tram, instead do the walking trails- you'll see a lot more animals than on the tram. It took us less than 2 hours to do these and its possible to stop half way around and get the tram back. Make sure you take lots of water and insect repellent. Walk slowly and quietly and you will see lots of animals very close up.
If you arrive early in the evening and do the walking trails immediately, by the time you've finished the trails it will be later in the evening and you can go on the tram (with no queues!) and see the few animals that you can't see on the walking trail. Although we enjoyed the tram ride, we found that it went a bit too quickly to have enough time to see all the animals. Also, other tourists are noisy!
Food choice is a bit limited if you want to eat later.
Its easy to get an Uber here from other parts of Singapore.
The time on your ticket refers to the time you can enter the night safari park, it isn't the time for getting on the tram- you can do this any time.
Make sure you go in the bat enclosure!
We've been to a lot of zoos and we thought the night safari was excellent- a very different experience to other zoos that we've visited in the day time."
,,Long queue and not worth it,2.0,,"Bought our tix on9 n didn't expect to still be in a Long queue with my parents which is 2 elderly.

The walking trail actually has a better view on the animals , it is dark and the tram was moving too fast when we want to observe... was sat at the last row , apparently the car is too Long n ppl at the back can't see much because they move after middle n front section see the animals ...

Conclusion not really worth the money and my parents didn't enjoy it much."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"One of its kind experience to witness wildlife in the dark. Both attractions was fun filled, do not try to skip the attractions. It gets crowded when the show is starting so queue ahead to secure yourself a good seat.
Tram ride into rainforest was fantastic. We covered all 4 walking trails, I would recommend to do those trail but if not then tram ride is must.
TIP: once entered the park head directly for the queue at creatures of the night show, it starts at 7.30pm. Usually there will be long queue to go on tram ride first but this can be done later as tram frequency is 5 to 10 mins. Show are 2 times and first come first serve basis. Enjoy!"
,,Just there.,4.0,,"It's a real crowd spinner but for the experienced traveller, it'll not wow you.
The nightly shows are overrated but I must give kudos to the trainers and the MCs that try to make it more lively.
Since you are there anyways, just go to the scheduled night show but the unscheduled fire eating dance shows is more dramatic and I wish we spent more time watching.
The safari just consists of a slow night ride inside the forests. You will get glimpses of animals but that is all.
I think it'll be better to just go during the day."
,,"""Africa by night"", a safe and secure unique experience.",5.0,,"This unique experience will be so memorable. There are 1,000 animals to be seen in their nocturnal wanderings, paying scant attention to the trolleys full of silent tourists only metres away - protected by moats and other secure measures. The soft lighting clearly shows these beautiful creatures actively doing their natural procedures, as they would in the wild, and not sleeping or avoiding the daytime heat in the bushes. Animals include: lions, tigers, elephants, hippos, hyenas, buffalo, giraffe, rhinos, bears - and a rare bongo. A must-see, but avoid Saturday nights - big delays."
,,Great family place,4.0,,"A well set out zoo with many great attractions, we did the night zoo and it was spectacular. I would recommend a visit to families."
,,Brilliant experience,5.0,,"Words cannot describe how wonderful this experience truly is. So many animals you would never see this close! Due to the extensive queue for the Tram, we walked the Zoo walking trails first. So glad we did. The animals were all out and visible! Seeing them at night added a new dimension for us, having only seen animals in the day before. Difficult to get into main Creature show which was frustrating. Luckily we could make the 9.30pm show. Crowds are massive. They allow too many people in I believe at once. Tram ride was INSANELY BRILLIANT!! Worth a visit but be prepared for big crowds."
,,Boring,3.0,,"Me and my friends decided to go to this place since we've been hearing a lot of great things about it. We got there really late and I guess that's one of the reason why we didn't see a lot of animals. So as soon as you enter; you'll be directed to ride a train which is open air (bring mosquito repellent!). It runs really slow and it plays a voice over explaining all the information about the animals that we're passing by. The downside is, it's really hard to spot the animals because its really dark. So good luck to those who has a bad eyesight. They have restaurants in the area so you can eat after and also buy some trinkets from the souvenir shop, though its a little expensive."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We booked the Classic Tour. Worth every cent! Our guide was absolutely amazing. Animals were out and close enough to see well at all stops. In all a fabulous night, would recommend to anyone! 🦁🐯"
,,Really enjoyed,5.0,,We enjoyed the night safari and the show. It was fun. Kids were enjoying and so are adults. We took the tram ride to enjoy rainforest and we have been given the history of the animals coming by ..by an automated recorded voice which was really useful if you are curious to know about animal history. Overall it was fun.
,,Night Safari Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"A great experience. Got lost on walks round especially when one finished and another started. Show well worth watching. Staff extremely helpful. Very pleased to be allowed in early as not too many people rather than wait around from close of main zoo to allotted time. Great display of animals.
Booked in the U.K. and would have been advantageous to know how long walks would take. We would have booked an earlier time as had to get back to city and not rushed the walks so much. Public transport did work really well"
,,Excellent,5.0,,The information provided by the tour on the tram was excellent and seeing them at night provided another context. The walk was excellent as well and we saw many animals like we have never seen before. We'll be back.
,,Walk on the Wild Side,5.0,,"The Night Zoo allows a visitor to see all the animals up and about from the ease of a ride on train that takes visitors around the zoo. Once the ride is over, visitors can walk to the different animal enclosures for a longer look."
,,Not much fun,3.0,,It was not much fun as we didn't saw much animals in the safari and there is only one veg restaurant whose name I guess is Ulu ulu and the food was very good there. Better to go zoo than this night safari.
,,Avoid the queues by going with an organised group,3.0,,"We enjoyed this evening but wouldn't have enjoyed it had we had to queue. We went on an organised coach tour so everything was booked, thus skipping the queues. It's a nice place but nothing too amazing so not really worth queuing for in my opinion. The show which our tour guide said was mainly for families with young children was really good and my husband and I really enjoyed it, not just the kids!"
,,So So!!,2.0,,"Well I suggest if you are going to go, find your own way there. We went with a tour and I hated it. Waiting, rushing, don't get to enjoy it.
The park opens around 7pm to 12 pm. You can go at your own pace see what you want to see. Dinner, you could eat before you go. Wasn't that exciting.
Overall you dont get to take any good photos unless you have a special camera that can take photos at night as you cant use a flash. The animals yes are wonderful and it is a different experience, but I would not do it again. We were excited to go and had a less then impressed time."
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"Like so many other things in Singapore, this is so unique to Singapore and a great experience. A must do if time and money permits, since this is something one doesn't get to do and see anywhere else. Its great to see the animals in the dark, and they have done a great job and organizing it. Be prepared for long waiting time."
,,Information provided in advance wasn't correct,2.0,,"Unfortunately the so called ""night safari"" was not a nice drive through the zoo, there was a huge vehicle with too many people and also there was a show - more for kids than for adults- which we didn't know before. And we felt sorry for the animals some of them (especially the elephants) looked really disturbed by the bright light which was put on them!
And If you go there by Public transport it takes over an hour to get there!
Apart from that the staff was really nice and helpful!"
,,Fun Night,5.0,,Night Safari is very cool. Get to see a lot of interesting animals. Most can be seen up close and they are pretty active. Would definitely recommend doing this.
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,I honestly did not expected to see so many animals with this kind of explanation and that too in very comfortable way it was.
,,Night safari,5.0,,Very well organised suitable for all with easy access very informative staff very helpful and ready to be of assistance as required
,,Must go for all animal lovers,5.0,,"I went with a friend, and it was one of the most wonderful experiences I had. We did not take the tram, but took the slow route by walking all the trails around the park. This gave us a chance to slowly observe some of the smaller animals in the very well made habitats. Some highlights for me were the giant fruit bat and bird walkthrough, as well as the giant squirrels.
Definitely recommend this attraction."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"This is the second time I've taken visitors to the night safari and all have said how good the experience was. It's a really unusual way to spend an evening, the only thing I would say is that it's not obvious that the last Creatures of the Night showing is at 9:30pm on weekdays and thus we missed it. We also got the last tram of the evening and the member of staff was obviously really keen to get it over with as he took half the time it normally takes to get round the park which was pretty annoying and didn't seem to take it to account the length of the tram and that there were actually passengers at the back that would like to see too!"
,,A must do place in Singers,5.0,,"My second visit and a first for my wife. So great to see the animals out at night (as they sleep all day!) and all from the safety of a tractor train pulling open carriages as you are driven around the zoo.
Plenty of on site entertainment too and a wide range of food and drinks plus the usual shops for fluffy toys and souvenirs etc.
Definitely one to do if visiting Singapore!"
,,It’s exhausting but worth it,5.0,,I’m not suggesting you to come on weekend because this place is always crowded on weekend. And of course it’s hot. So better come weekdays
,,Wow queue nightmare,1.0,,7.15pm session get here at 6pm so u are front of the queue. Otherwise standing in a line min. 1hr. The trams start at exactly 7.15pm not 1 minute before so enjoy waiting. Staff said no one complains
,,Not recommended!,1.0,,"Never ever choose this tour, its useless! It was Too dark, can hardly see the animals😒☹️ oh so i need to say more! Ok.. lousy tour, darkness everywhere! 😒"
,,Fun with wildlife!,3.0,,"The good thing about the night safari is that you are taken on a train through the specially prepared Amazon forests. You encounter various animals such as Hippopotamus,elephants, lions, tiger,antelopes,chital, boar, foxed, rhinoceros and many other varieties of animals which could be seen basking in their night rest. The bad thing is the long queues. But then you have an option- you can take a quick entry ticket."
,,A great night out,4.0,,"We went there with my seven year old. We arrived around 6.30pm but the 7.15pm entry was already sold out so we had to wait for an hour. So, if you can, buy your time slot before you arrive. We went directly to the creatures of the night show, instead of waiting in line for the tram. That was a good move, the line after the show for the tram ride wasn't that bad. The tram ride was really interesting, never saw a white lion before. Here's a tip: try to end up in the middle of the train, it will give you the best and longest view of the animals. Also, when standing in line to enter the zoo, try to be on the left side, that's where they will do a pretty cool fire show before they open the door for your time slot."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Buffet food was ok, not the best I've seen though

The safari was on too, not quite what I had expected but we did see a few animals. All appeared to have been fed to ensure they were where they needed to be

A fair way to go to equal Animal Kingdom or Longleat"
,,Animals in Dark !,5.0,,"Night safari is really good , all kinds of Animals from different parts of the world are present in the zoo .

We are taken into the zoo in a train and explained about the animals by Safari Team

There is an entertainment performance by Animals as well , do not miss it .

Thanks
Sonam & Varun"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This was great from the creatures of the night show to the 40 minute tram ride around the park to see the animals in their natural habitat. Was great to see some of the animals wondering around close to the tram. Definitely do the four walks to see the animals. Would recommend getting there early and enjoy some of the food from the various vendors prior to opening. You have to purchase tickets as they have alloted times we did the first intake at 7.15pm which was great as there werent heaps of people as there would have been if you entered at a later time.
,,Good but nothing special.,3.0,,"After reading lots of great reviews we had high expectations.

We arrived for the 7:15pm entry and headed for the creatures of the night show at 7:30pm. The show was very staged and we were slightly disappointed but I guess we might be showing our age as the shows target audience was definitely children. If you have young children we would definitely recommend. The show lasts half an hour but get there early if you want to get a seat as they stop letting people in when it is full. We were slightly confused as to why some of the seating was reserved when we were told you can't possibly reserve seating???

After the show finished we headed for the tram which there was a long que for so get out of the show quickly to avoid the que. the tour was ok, they crammed the tram full so we couldn't see everything which was annoying. The elephants were incredible and so were the lions, make sure you take a good camera as you'll never see anything like them again. The tram ride lasted about 45mins and then you are able to walk around the park but there are some bits you can't access again (like the elephants.)

We would recommend going but don't get too excited!"
,,Very long queues and way too many people,1.0,,"My first visit last night with the family to the NIght Safari, making use of our annual pass. But it was really a major error to come on a weekend - way too many people and ridiculous queues for the tram rides and the shows (it was impossible to get into the shows due to the sheer number of people). Overall a very disappointing experience and I definitely wouldn't have been happy if we had actually paid for a single visit. If we go again then I think it has to be on a weeknight - maybe the queues aren't as bad then."
,,Nice 👍,3.0,,"We did the safari night train. It cost online 35$ each and also take ride to there. We stand on line for 20 minutes. The show was nice total ride on train explore is 30 minute and you can see some animals that probably are druged. It is above experience mostly for children.
There is also 15 minutes show later the more suitable for kids"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Have visited twice. It’s a fascinating way to spend an evening. There is a ‘train’ ride through the park with an informative guide.

You really get to see and hear clearly most of the nocturnal animals there. It’s great.

The park is well arranged and organised.

Younger children may be tired as you can easily spend hours here and if you choose, there can be quite a lot of walking too."
,,I slept,3.0,,"Maybe the weather , maybe the cool breeze after a light rain in the afternoon,maybe the night creatures' jungle sounds, maybe it's me..but I slept most the the trip 😊"
,,Rather disappointing,2.0,,The animals are interesting to see and well kept. I didn't like the opening show which reminded me of a zoo in which animals were made to perform. The trolley ride lasts approx. 40 mins but you actually don't get to see much as the place is huge so you only stop for brief moments at each location. You can walk around which is nice but not all places are accessible on foot. It was OK but I wouldn't go back.
,,Very Average,3.0,,"Heard a lot about this place, but it did not meet our expectations The actual night safari itself was very average. You can barely see any animals and can only hear recorded sounds from speakers on the tram."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,We went on the evening Safari and really enjoyed it. Very up close with the animals. It was about £25 for the evening and lots to see and do.
,,Average,3.0,,"Going to the night safari was the most harrowing experience in Singapore for us .i had my 80+ year old dad with me and it was the worst mistake I made to take him. Most disorganized. The line looped around several times . It was HOT! There were not enough fans. Not senior friendly. Not handicap friendly . I was almost fainting after standing in the line for over 2 and a half hours and I am not making it up . I had tickets for the 8:15 safari on September 9. They can check the records they don't have enough trams so the line crawls . Staff is rude and shouting at people. Why sell so many tickets to torture people.
My advice: maybe avoiding a Saturday will help
Also I have Heard the zoo itself is nice and maybe seeing the animals in the day will not be such an ordeal
But all in all the whole experience was a nightmare"
,,"Must see, Unique zoo",5.0,,"This zoo is based Some 45 minutes from the city Center. We booked transport and entrance with an agent. IT included fast pas entrance for the safari tram. This zoo is only opened in the evening and shows nocturnal animals, which makes iT a Unique zoo. We only had 3 hours to visit iT, which is just enough for the tram and the 2 Trails closest to the entrance, do I advise to take the whole evening to visit. Very Well organised facility."
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,"I loveeedddddd this safari!!! Lovely cool breeze, beautiful forest and amazing animals made our experience one of the best in Singapore!"
,,Just ok,3.0,,"My husband and I normally like zoos, so we decided to see what all they hype was about. We went on a Saturday night at 7pm, but it was not peak season and F1 was going on the same weekend so it was not crowded at the night safari at all. We pre-bought our tickets online, which saved a little time. We showed up at 7 and queued for 10 minutes to enter the night safari. Upon entering, we saw that everyone was heading for the tram first, so we headed to the show instead. We got straight in and got second row seats without any queues. The show was quite underwhelming. It is only 30 minutes long and the first 5 minutes are spent telling the audience not to use flash while taking pictures. Why does it take a whole 5 minutes to do this? Because they do it in every language they know (English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Malay, etc.)! Useless because people still annoyingly used flashes. When they finally do start the show, they just basically parade out a few animals one by one and tell you some fun facts about each one. There is a Binturong, owl, snake, hyena, cat and otter. They make the otter do a silly trick to throw out some garbage. The other animals are shown on stage while they talk about it. After the show we went to the tram and only had to queue for 15 minutes. The line moves very quickly because a tram comes every 5 minutes. The tram ride has a recorded English commentary, not a live person talking like on the Disney animal kingdom or San Francisco zoo tram ride. The tram ride lasts for 40 minutes, during which time you struggle to see all the animals in the dark while the tram spends a few seconds at each enclosure. Again, people were ignoring instructions and used their flash to take pictures throughout the ride. Every 5 minutes the driver asked passengers not to use flash, but they ignored him and continued to do so until the very end. The no flash rule wasn't enforced and the driver just had to keep giving useless reminders that went ignored. If you don't use a flash it is impossible to take any pictures unless you have night vision mode on your camera like the very prepared couple sitting next to us. After the tram ride we did all 4 of the walking trails. The trails are dark and quiet and not crowded at all. We enjoyed this the most of everything, but there were some animals that were too difficult to see in the dark, like the giant flying squirrels. I don't know why, but they weren't flying around when we were there and we didn't spot a single one. Surprisingly, many of the animals were asleep despite the fact that they were supposed to be nocturnal. Overall, the experience was just ok but not something we will return again for.

Tip: They allow you to bring in outside food and drink, so we brought our own sandwiches and ate them while waiting in line. Also bring mosquito repellent."
,,Night Safari - One of an experience,4.0,,The main attraction of the park is the tram ride and the fiery show at the entrance point. We took the tram ride first and then walked the trail. Walking the trail is more fun then the tram ride as by walk you can get to many places where tram doesn't go. Food options are decent and you can buy some souvenirs at the exit gate as well. If you have young children then the visit is worth or else it would be just a tram ride seeing animals.
,,Not worth the wait time as Tram ride is very short,3.0,,"We had entrance vouchers so you have to print tickets from the kiosk when you arrive. There was a big queue to enter and then there is a queue for Tram ride, which took nearly two hours. The tram ride is around 20 mins, we were able to see animals but not close views and not worth the wait time. If you walk in and see trails your self, this trip might be worth. But for us it was just an average zoo visit with few animals seen. I would suggest only to go Night Safari if you have visited other places and have time left and are ready to spend some bucks on this. Dining options were good there were several restaurants so you have options."
,,Night safari!?,2.0,,"Overall the park is presented well and has the feel of a night safari although if you have been to Zoo's around the world you will be very let down.

The amphitheater show at the start only showed about 5 animals and felt like playschool.

The actual night safari itself was very average. You can barely see any animals and all the Main ones are smart and out of sight.

If you are going here for the (adventure) of a night safari then don't be fooled when you walk through the gates."
,,A lot of fun,4.0,,First it's a long way from town. Think 30 minutes in a taxi. The tram is a must. We did the tram first (40minutes) and then walked for maybe an hour. There are a lot of animals and they were all doing something (unlike daytime zoos where you can see a pile of fur or 2 snoring in the grass). Love the concept and loved the experience. With or without kids - great fun. Put it on the must do in Singapore list for sure.
,,Definitely what you make of it,5.0,,"So many of you will have noticed that reviews of this attraction are decidedly mixed.IMHO that is for two reasons
A) animals are notoriously unpredictable and no matter how skilful you are at creating a zoo as a viewing attraction you can't stop those pesky critters hiding away from view some of the time. Infuriatingly they resort to their natural behaviours and hide away from potential danger or the elements or stay still precisely because they are designed to be hidden from view from predators or prey
B) we are a very mixed society but increasingly we are a species of limited attention span who think everything they want in life should magically be delivered on their laps without any effort.

So don't be surprised that the numerous people we observed running noisily at great pace around the zoo in the dark saw very little. Had they stayed with people who had patience and kept their mouths shut for a few minutes they might have been pleasantly surprised. And if they could have resisted banging on glass windows funnily enough the animals may not have wandered off.
We visited on GP night so maybe not too busy. There were no queues. It is true that it appears that no matter what time slot you bury they just seem to let you in and I think the zoo should r econsider this particularly at busier times. There are basically three things to do, there is a tram ride with live commentary by the driver through some of the animal enclosures; several different walking trails and a show where they have a few animals that hey show to you. The ride is quite good and the teams are spacious and impressively quiet. We saw quite a lot if different creatures out and about. The trails were my favourite and reward the patient and quiet visitor. It's surprising what you miss if you don't put a bit if effort in. The show was ok and worth a look. It takes about 30 mins although they could shorten the somewhat lengthy intro but again that is in an attempt to ensure that the crowd don't scare the animals with flash photography. Of course that is such a difficult task because humans whether through stupidity or wilfull disobedience seem to find it impossible to accede to even the most reasonable request!

I've never come across anything similar elsewhere. The design of the zoo is fantastic and we had a great night and would highly recommend. Lastly if anyone has done a few safaris you will know that it is hit and miss what you see one day to the next. The same applies to the animals in a zoo which is really part if the fun. My own nightmare would be a world where everyone had everything the wanted all the time simply because they wanted it."
,,Victim of it's own popularity!,3.0,,"The word on the grape vine was 'amazing don't miss it' So we went and pretty much missed it!! To be fair we may have been unlucky on our visit in August. Firstly the crowds, literally thousands descended on the place which supposedly has three entry times between 7.30 and 9.30 each evening. Organisation was non-existent, pre-purchased tickets still had to be machine authenticated and guaranteed a position at the end of a never ending snaking queue of people. After waiting in the masses for at least 20minutes after our scheduled 7.30 entry time and with patience running out we scrambled to find somebody official and was eventually nonchalantly told that the 7.30 people can go through an unmarked entry at the side. This was the start and stop of our safari! On the other side long queues of people herded into Disney style pens waited for the open sided trains to drop of passengers after the loop tour. When we eventually boarded we were driven round various open and closed compounds with a pre-recorded commentary describing the animals as we approached each area. The areas with dangerous animals were skillfully created to give the impression of roaming free and I'm sure the zoo has very high standards of care and responsibility for these creatures. Unfortunately lighting was obviously fairly dim throughout and several animals, bored with the constant intrusion and had slinked away for some peace and quiet. I know other reviews have been positive but in my opinion visit the zoo in the daytime when were are all bright, bushy tailed and awake!"
,,Good experience..,4.0,,"It was good experience. we were tired after a long day at zoo so covered night safari through tram only. However, there was option to walk through the trails. We preferred tram.

Cant do photography here as it is very dark and difficult to spot animals.

You must go there once just because it is unique experience which most of the zoos in the world dont provide."
,,Boring and waste of money,3.0,,Not a lot to see in the dark compounded by the fact that you could only see from the side of the tram you were sitting on. Paid for the priority queue which was worth doing given the large queues to see very little. The advertising was most certainly over hyped. Don't waste your money!
,,Not to be missed!!,5.0,,"This is a must, put this on top of your to do list. It's great fun and so much to see. You can even get a beer before you go around."
,,Animals... where are you?,3.0,,Nice atmosphere.. nice layout.. but kind of boring as most of the animals are asleep.. only few are awake.. the show is boring too.. no sense on excitement that can motivate the crowd.. the tram ride is fairly good but there is no fan and no wind as it moves very slowly..
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our evening at the night safari. Reading previous reviews we were worried about long queues on entrance and for the tram but when we arrived at 7:30pm we walked straight into buy our tickets and on to the tram! We went on a Tuesday and it was really quiet.
The tram ride is really good and the walking trails are really fun.. the animals are far more active than in regular day zoos.
A really unique and worthwhile experience."
,,Dont miss this,5.0,,Had a fab night at the Night Safari in Singapore didnt think I would have got so close to Elephants they were magnificent together with all the other animals in this venue. The tram ride was fab make sure you get a pre booked slot. Only downside is the food and drink are horrendously expensive even by Singapore standards.
,,Awesome little night activity,5.0,,"My husband and I bought tickets for this and we purchased the express lane pass which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

The line is ridiculously LONG!!! with our express passes we were right at the front of the que and missed the whole line, they boarded us on to the trams at a different location which was so much easier!!!
The tram ride itself was really interesting, it really is a safari, we were able to see the animals without any bars or glass walls separating us. It was all open and was really cool to see some of the animals literally walking or eating along the drive path way.

They have a english voice over and the driver slows down by each of the animal stops so you can see them and take photos if you can (NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY ALLOWED)

They also offer a walking tour which you can do and walk it instead of doing the tram OR you can do both, tram and the walk. They have a walking trail which takes up to 1hour to do the whole thing.

There's also a few eating places to choose from while your there, prices are reasonable but not cheap cheap.

I really enjoyed myself but I would recommend to pay the extra and pay for the express tram ride ticket."
,,Exceptional Service,5.0,,"It was a hot night but didn't turn us off in the Safari. All of the staff are very friendly and willing to explain everything about this safari! I met one of yr staff, he was so helpful and going extra miles to help us about things to do. We sat at the restaurant and suddenly he came to us said he reserved seats for us to enjoy the show at 2030. We were all so happy and wow it was our lucky night to met this gentleman in the safari! Thank you for all u guys hard work to maintain the safari and protect our precious animals x"
,,The lines were just too long,1.0,,We had tickets for the 8pm time slot. We arrive at 7:45pm and joined the cue straight away. It took 1 and a half hours before we got on a tram. The tram ride itself was great. Although we would have liked to have a stroll around after the tram tour we had booked transportation back to the city so had a quick look but had to rush to get our bus.
,,Excellent evening,5.0,,"We did the Night Safari after the Zoo. It's very well organised as there is an hour or two between the Zoo closing and the Night Safari opening. The food and entertainment just outside the Night Safari gates more than fills the gap. The Safari itself is on a road tram and provides onboard commentary, and lasts a good half an hour. After that there are several trails that you can walk around to see the animals at your own pace.

Be aware that the cab drivers at the exit aren't keen to take people to local train stations, but are only interested in taking passengers back to the city."
,,Full Day (and night) trip,5.0,,"The zoo takes a bit of effort to get to, as it's not on a train link from the city. We travelled to a nearby station and got a cab for around SGD10 to the zoo. Be aware though, if you do the night safari none of the cab drivers are keen to take you a few miles - they want the trips back to the city. The zoo itself has an excellent range of animals, and is keen to educate visitors about how to protect the animals in the wild."
,,No queues on our safari,5.0,,"The night safari was something we were really looking forward to on our visit to Singapore but I must say the reviews about long queues almost put us off. I tried to organise a fast track pass on the day, but the online booking system would only allow fast track bookings for the following day. I looked at private tours but felt they were over the top expensive. And I worried about getting there and back too as it was miles from the centre of town and I thought we could be left stranded. In the end we just went for it though - on a regular ticket bought online and taking an Uber there and back - and it was a massive success without costing the earth. The two 24 year old 'children' loved it and we saw all the animals including leopard, lion, crocodile, fishing cats, going about their activities under the cloak of darkness. We deliberately left it late and went on the 9.15pm slot on a Sunday which probably helped, and enjoyed the creatures of the night show, tram ride, and walking tour. I guess it's all about timing mixed with an element of luck."
,,Magnificent journey,5.0,,"Safari was provided with pre recorded audio guide in English language with option to change language if one has an earphones. The area was well lit, sufficient enough to see animals but not to disturb them. Photography was allowed without flash."
,,Unique animal experience,5.0,,We saw all sorts of stuff you would never see at a zoo in daytime. Unique opportunity to see something very different. This is a must do in Singapore.
,,singapore zoo,4.0,,"Good place for adults and children, the train ride , night show with animals is a must watch, dont miss the river safari as well."
,,Nice night experience,5.0,,Took my kids to the night tour and they loved it. Ride was fine and cool. We did see many animals. A fun time!
,,Just ok,3.0,,"Cons:
Safari would be good if its daylight so you can see the animals better. Tram driver did not match the phase of voice over and usaually fast.

Pros:
Creature of the night show is fantastic. Very good host. Wallaby trail is also nice. Park is beautiful but maybe will appreciate it more if i see it on daylight."
,,Something Different,4.0,,"This was one of the first things my family of five did when we arrived in Singapore.

It was eye opening. The kids loved every second of it. We walked for the firs half of it while most people rushed to the trains which was highly rewarding. Towards the end we caught the train because the kids were getting tired of walking.

The whole night was pretty awesome."
,,beyond chaos!,1.0,,"The night safari, was in my opinion a waste of money, with the whole event being total chaos! having purchased tickets - we beleived to offer flexibility we found out when we turned up that we still had to stand in massive queues to get tickets and ensure we got on the tour. We ended up having to return two nights later as there simply wasn't room. Whilst we actually got admittance to the night safari at the second attempt, we we then told that the 'tram ride' was full and advised to either wait another hour (we had been stood over an hour in the queue just to get through the turnstiles), or walk around then come back later. Having walked around all the trails we were then told we had to join the back of a further queue which was bigger than when we actually got into the park! We did see some interesting animals up close but unfortunately this did not help the frustration of queing for so long! A bit of a nonsense really."
,,Book online.,5.0,,"Long queues, expect this especially during holidays. Book online or any tour booth; they'll book early entry times for you - you can enter early. Earliest entry time is 7pm. Lots of eateries and gift shops within venue. 40 minutes ride and note that no flashing is allowed - the animals are not caged."
,,Great shopping and eating here...,4.0,,Stopped off here during my sightseeing tour and it was amazing looking at the older building converted into today's shopping area and great food stops every where. This has to be included in your tour of Singapore.
,,The Surprise of the trip,4.0,,I wasn't sure about going on the Night Safari but was glad I did. You were so close to the animals and viewing them was quite the experience for nighttime. You do the tram ride and then can do the walking tour. The rain forest is quite impressive.
,,Still the best night activities,5.0,,Love the well planned park so friendly for children! Tram rides for all and of course if you want to walk the park at night by all means!
,,You won't find this anywhere else!,5.0,,"A great evening out. We started with the river safari during the day and then after a meal in the nearby eateries we went to the night safari. This was amazing. A ride around the animals live, a live animals show and walking on night time trails with animals around was a great night out. One of the best attractions in Singapore, definitely worth the trip and highly recommendable. The train ride is 30-40 mins and excellent. Worth the money. The live show is also very good."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Spent the evening here, a very cool experience for animal lovers. Arrive early and watch the show before hand as it can be very busy."
,,Jungle Rumble,4.0,,"We recently visited Singapore and did the Night Safari and the zoo. Great experience visiting the zoo and night - the coolness of the evening brings out both the animals and the visitors.

Couple of tips:-

- you can get there using the MRT. Cheap but the bus connection is painfully slow and busy. If you have an alternative I would consider that instead

- go as early as you can and book in advance. It gets really busy! Go with your ticket in hand

- consider doing a walk about first then the tram. It gets less busy as the night wears on

- and don't forget the insect repellant

It's worth a visit at least once."
,,Far too busy,2.0,,"It is not a bad place but it is totally oversubscribed and quite badly over organised.a number of the animals were not to be seen..

Plan on queuing half of the time for the show or train ride. The food options are limited and as you may expect are expensive."
,,Super experience,5.0,,"You really come to watch something totally different than any previous zoo experience. You cross the zoo at night time. You see how animals behave at night. So many informations reaches you through the tram commentary. A really worth doing adventure.
P.S. take care of the very huge queue. Don't give up & leave because what you will see is really amazing."
,,Awsome experience,5.0,,"Though i have seen reviews that people wer not able to see any animals, we were lucky enough to see almost everyone in the forest including lions.
Tip: The show is amazing but to get into it thers a long waiting queue which is the only frustrating in this attraction. Almost everyone books for a 7:15 ride to attend the 7:30 show but will not be able to attend it at same time. Ther is a 10dollar extra privilege option without a queue,check at counter itself.
Fire dance at the entrance not inside !!"
,,I felt like I gave my kid the whole world when I took him to Night Safari.,5.0,,"I researched Night Safari before we left home and I booked online in advance for the private tour tickets as apparently they can sell out. It's more expensive but there was only the two of us and seriously it was one of the best travel decisions I have made.
We started the evening with a private restaurant buffet meal which was delicious; followed by reserved seating for the show where we sat directly beneath the spot where a Malaysian Bear climbed out across the audience to enter the arena. After the show we were escorted to a golf cart just for the two of us by our dedicated guide. He was brilliant. My boy was 4 years old at the time and could talk your ear off for hours on end and ask more annoying questions than you would ever think of. Our guide just took it all in his stride and was so professional he just blew me away. Our guide (I'm so sorry I can't remember his name!) knew an interesting fact about every animal in the park including their best hiding spots, so we saw absolutely every animal in the park. I had friends who took the retail tour that said it was annoying that often you couldn't see some of the animals from the train especially if they hid down close to the walls (like the hippos did). But we were taken up close to everything and did the whole night at our own pace (and that was worth the extra money on its own!).
Just over halfway through the tour we stopped for a private feeding of the elephants. My son and I were each given a bucket of fruit to give to 4 big elephants. No one else was around, just us and the elephants, our guide and two keepers. It was so quiet; soft rain had just started to come down on what was otherwise a balmy night and my boy was super excited to have the attention of these massive elephants. At one point, myself, our guide and the two keepers just stood back and for a moment it was just one little boy feeding 4 big elephants and I just thought ""Wow. I gave this moment to my kid and this will last for both our lifetimes""."
,,Nice place to see,4.0,,"A good sight for all ages. The night safari offers two evening shows plus a park to walk around. The first show is called Creatures of the night and is geared towards children, but does provide some animals to see and learn about. The second show is a Polynesian fire show and is very entertaining. The park itself has many animals to see, and almost all are roaming and visible during the evening hours. The park offers a team ride that will take you around the park and offers good views of the animals and a audio tour as well."
,,A Great Experience,5.0,,"An interesting and unique experience. The enclosures are very natural looking. Makes one feel like they're ""part of nature"""
,,Unexpected delight,5.0,,"Long lines but it was a legal holiday, however we were entertained by drumbeat at first we thought that it was just a recording when suddenly young people were dancing towards the line with drums and other percussion instruments. The singapore night safari will then wow you with the fire show. The educating tram ride was thrilling because it was mostly dark and the tram would stop at some points, there was a moment when my mom was apprehensive because she was scared that the lions would jump but no worries there was a 6-m wide creeklike thing separating the lions' area and the road where the tram traverses. The creatures of the night show was surprising because they inject witty anecdotes and funny interactions with the audience. We were suppose to go to the 8:30pm show but unfortunately it was already full so we had to go to the 10:30pm show (as it was a first come first serve basis). Overall it was a great way to end the evening."
,,Night safari singapore,1.0,,"Our night safari was a disaster.
Public holiday and rain and hot
So many people that we were queued up for half an hour before being in another holding pattern for at least 30 mins for the tram.
Then the push to get us round quickly and no opportunity to get off and walk some of the way.
Would not like to be in that position again.
I would think zoo authorities would think about limiting numbers just for safety reasons alone.
Elaine"
,,Very disappoining,3.0,,"We had booked a 7,15pm entry and perhaps because it was the day after Singapores National Day, there were long queues, which in the heat for older people was not comfortable. We were then directed to the Animals of the Night show, which could have been more interesting. We then had to walk back to the entry area where we had to queue again for at least 15 minutes before joining the tram. The trip itself was interesting to see the animals in their natural habitats at night, commentaries were in good english and made it easier to understand.
Overall I'm not sure if I would do it again. Perhaps a daytime visit to the Zoo would be better."
,,Amazing experience. A must when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"Truly excellent. We opted for the animal encounter package and got to feed the elephants.

September can be extremely busy and large lines for the trams. Due to us booking the upgraded package we got a personal buggy with our own tour guide.

Nadiah was our guide and we were extremely well looked after. She knew a lot about all the animals and the entire staff were incredible.

Cannot recommend this experience highly enough.

Only slight downside was the buffet meal (included) was a bit limited and you pay extra for drinks but overall 10/10."
,,Kids loved it - so did we!,5.0,,"We did the NIght Safari and it absolutely captivated both the kids and us. We saw so many animals, and learned so much from the talk they play while you're on the tram.
We went back another day for the River Safari, which was just as good. I don't usually go to zoos, but this was very nicely done and you feel as if the animals are well treated and happy."
,,Night time Safari a hit,5.0,,Returned to Singapore Zoo 16 years after my first visit. This time to try the night Safari. I was not disappointed. Give yourself plenty of time to wander as you may have to wait to see some of the animals late in the evening. The train ride certainly made for a relaxing tour of the night zoo. Such a contrast to seeing animals in the light of day.
,,Thank You Emmey,4.0,,"Oh - so a very long long day at the Zoo, and at the River Safari... after 8 hours we still cued to enter the Night Safari.... Thinking perhaps we should go for a tram tour and sit down, we were directed to meet the animals show, Informative but a little slow, when we came out there was a Que for the tram tour over an hour, we complained to one of the staff, he convinced us that if we had a walk round the night safari for 25-30 minutes, he'd get us a priority boarding of the tram Tour.... He did - thanks, the tour was great, and there's definitely a lot to see!"
,,Overcrowded and overpriced,2.0,,"Pretty average. Pity that I didn't go to the zoo instead. If it's a weekend or a public holiday, stay away as the tram queue can get looooong."
,,Absolutely excellent!,5.0,,"Totally unsure about what to expect but awesome. The park is well laid out and easy to get around and fun for the whole family. Would definitely recommended going with a tour group as it is quite a way out of the city centre. Also I insist on priority tram rides if you go without a tour as the lines were very long. We spent $60 per adult and a little less for our 5 year old and went with a tour arranged by our hotel. The tour included return transport, priority tram ride, entry ticket and guide. Fabulous. New way to visit the zoo and extremely enjoyable."
,,One of its kind,5.0,,One of its kind Night Safari in the world. Endangered animals well kept in the open in an organized way.. Tram tour a must specially children's as well for grown up. Recommended for all visitors not to miss Night Safari when in Singapore.
,,The best zoo in the world?,5.0,,Having visited zoos across the world this has to be one of the best. Visited in both the day and evening. The night time experience is what makes this better than other huge zoos. Brilliant.
,,Overpriced and overcrowded,2.0,,"Went here for the 8:15 show (entrance times are staggered 7:15, 8:15, 9:15 & 10:15), but you'll need to start queuing around 45 minutes before after buying your tickets as it took our family around 1.5 hours from queuing to be actually getting on the tramp to start the 40 minutes ride across the tropical rain forest. The trip was okay but the biggest problem was the price , SG$45 each, totally $225 was quite a rip off and definitely not value for money which one can generally sums up Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a great experience. You need to plan getting on a early tram ride. The walks are fantastic and a must do. Both shows are great. Line up early. Huge crowds. Go during the week.
,,Very Exciting,5.0,,This is a very exciting tour. You can finish the day's work and attend this Safari. You see lot of animals.
,,Not too sure what to think 🤔,2.0,,"I have no idea what the hype is about the night safari, you can hardly see the animals or maybe we went on a bad day as it was drizzling. So in my opinion better go at the zoo during the day!"
,,Disaster,1.0,,"We wasted 6 hours on this just waiting around for a 40 minute tram ride. The best part was the bus ride out to the park! It was a public holiday and badly organised for the crowds. We waited for and hour and a half at the front of the rope barrier but when it wasn't opened at the expected time people poured over the side ropes in front of us so we ended up over half way back in the crush and then had another half hour wait to get on a tram. We saw about half the animals the rest were either out of sight, in shadow or had there backs to us and our tram broke down. We looked forward to the show when we got off the tram at 9.20 to only be directed to the exit and told the 9.30 show was full and come back for the 10.30 show. As the last bus left at 10.20 we not only couldn't see the show but then had to wait again for the bus!! A complete waste of time!"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Great experience. We saw many animals,bats and birds we'd never heard of before.Friends prepurchased tickets which saved particularly long queues.Night show was interesting and informative.Tram ride and commentary excellent."
,,Rainy Night Safari,4.0,,"The visit to the Night Safari was less than great because it was the peak of the tourist season and the long queue for the 35-minute tram ride took almost an hour. It was also raining so we were not able to do the walking trails. Fortunately, the rain stopped and the show pushed through. It was a great show. I appreciate the Night Safari not just for the beauty of the park but also for its efforts to help conserve the wildlife."
,,Great place to visit at night,4.0,,"The night safari was very good, you start off with a visit to the amphitheater to see the bird and other animals preforming.
You then que for the train ride around the park where you see the animals close up.
Photography is hard because you can not use a flash."
,,"Nice place, awfull admin",3.0,,"There is one big problem: they have certain times to enter. This creates huge lines, a lot of persons entering at the same time. After getting a long line, one more 40 minutes line to get the train. I have entered 9:15pm, the last entry time. When we finally finished the train ride, the show was already full! Not good experience, but the place is nice and new. Only bad administration. If you want to enjoy, get there 19:15. Oh, and 45 SGS to enter is a lot!"
,,A unique experience!,5.0,,"That is worth it, a walk through the built safari of Singapore, where animals are actively living, that usually sleep during daylight. Check it out, if you have the time and money for this unusual experience."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"Worth visiting especially if this is your first trip to Singapore. Although we couldn't always see the animals and it was certainly crowded. Found that hotel concierge and a local tour office gave us conflicting information about visiting. Having read other reviews we arrived about 8.30 for the 9.15 entry. It was busy but we avoided queues for hours like other reviewers have suggested. At that time of night we could buy tickets at the gate. In terms of getting there a taxi was easiest about half an hour from town and around $30-35. There was a long line at the end of the night for taxis but it only took about 10 mins. Make sure you do the Creatures of the Night show, that was our highlight."
,,Best of the lot!!!,4.0,,The concept is decent and loved the tram ride into the park after 7. Though i wish the ride lasted long but still its an experience to remember. The creatures of the night show is pretty average and should be made more exciting. Queues were very very long but we landed up at the right time in both the places(tram & the show). Loved the concept but a lot more can be done.
,,Nocturnal,4.0,,"I recommend you buy the all-in package which was 69 SGD per person and get to access FOUR PARKS that Singapore has to offer. It was my second visit at Night Safari. This year it's with my whole family. We decided to let mom and dad experience the first night Safari in the world that showcases nocturnal animals. I was kind of disappointed to the animal show though, I do understand that the animals were newbie performers but everything were so awkward that every sequence of the story failed to deliver what they're trying to express to the audiences, good thing the host was doing great in Adlibs and stuff; compared to my last visit way back 2015 the animals were truly magnificent and witty. The crowd, OH MY the crowd.. It felt like you're in ocean of people so patience is necessary. Everyone were shouting here and there. Some employees weren't approachable maybe got so stressed dealing with hard headed guests. Some tip is You should always bring bottled water with you especially traveling with elderly or kids. We waited for our tram ride for about 15-20 mins and everything went smooth then. So happy to see the night side of the jungle. The ride made everything calm and the breeze of the air was cold. You can choose to follow some trails after tram ride too but we tend not to do it since we were traveling with elderly. They have resto outside if you're hungry which was kind of expensive of course so better bring along some snacks with you and have dinner when you're back in the city, or have dinner first then enjoy the night Safari adventure .
Please AVOID using flash photography for the sake of the good. I pity the animals that got disturb by the struck of flashing lights."
,,Jungle in the night,5.0,,Enjoy the beauty of jungle in the night in a tram. Attend a short show before the trip. Must for young kids.
,,Amazing experience always,4.0,,"I've been to the night safari a couple of times n so I think I've found the most efficient way around it.
I prefer taking the 8.30 entry instead of 7.30.. so we don't need to tackle the tour crowd. Then we do the show first n then the trails till 12.
The last time we were there we missed the last tram n had to walk all the way to entrance n ironic as it sounds, we had the most exciting n heart racing walk back. In the silence of the dark, we could hear the howls n cries clearly.. N could feel the animals almost preying us!!
But of course there were staffs at regular intervals leading us out. So we were safe!"
,,A bit disappointed,3.0,,"The line was superrrrrr long and it was more tiring since we had kids. I can't see the animals they were telling, and I could not appreciate it. It was expensive for the show and the ride."
,,Fun on the Dark,5.0,,"Booked an organised tour, so coach pick up from hotel and back again. Also this ensured had priority entry onto the train, a must as the general entry queues were very long. Our tour guide was excellent we walked straight onto our guided train ride, which then gave us lots of time to complete the walking routes. A great experience and worth doing."
,,Enjoyable visit on the night safari,4.0,,We took our son on the night safari as it offers a different experience than visiting the regular zoo. He has been to the singapore zoo and so we thought that this would be a newer experience for him. Advice I can offer parents travelling with young children is to purchase the tickets on line and to opt for the first ride which is the 7.15 pm. Saturday's are generally crowded but the lines move fast and you have the facility of using strollers up until the time you get on the tram as well as being entertained by the fire dancers. The actual ride lasts about 20 mins and as we slowly rode through the zoo we saw many different animals from flamingos to deer to hyenas and elephants. A good description about the animals and their habitat was provided throughout the ride and it was quite a fun and educational ride. We opted to travel by taxi and this was faster than using the mrt.
,,A total disaster!,1.0,,"What we anticipated to be the highlight of my aunt from China and her family's visit to Singapore turned out to be a total disaster.

I had booked the 7.15pm tixs on line, and gotten to the venue at 7pm.
After 10 mins looking around and asking for directions, we had to wait about 30 mins in line to 'redeem' our booking vouchers.
Then came another 30-45 mins wait to enter the venue. A 15mins fire eating show near the entry provided some respite during the wait.

Once inside, there was an announcement that the 8.30pm 'Creatures of the Night' show was full. We need to come half an hour earlier for either the 9.30pm or 10.30pm performance.

My aunt is 70 years old and my nephew is 4, so the walking trails were out of the questions.
There was a sea of people in front of us in the queue for the tram ride. We suffered an hour and 20 mins wait. It was nearly 9.30pm when we boarded the tram.
It doesn't make sense to wait more than 2.5 hours for a 30-40 mins safari.

My nephew dozed off halfway through the ride. My aunt, tired and hungry, kept muttering that the animals were all very tame.
All six of us sat through the 10.30pm show joylessly, our enthusiasm sapped by the tortuous waiting.

My relatives were clearly disappointed but too polite to complain. Needless to say, I was very embarrassed.

It was the worst $250 (tixs and transport) I had ever spent on an outing."
,,Holiday,2.0,,"I was really looking forward to this but must admit I was disappointed. It is too dark to really see any animals. Most of the animals seemed to be sleeping. You can't take photos as it is too dark and are unable to use a flash. You ride a train with audio which was good, but most the animals mentioned I didn't see. We then did a walking tour which our guide gave us a map as to not get lost but again was too dark too see it."
,,Waste of Time :(,1.0,,"We were looking forward to the Night Safari, but were extremely disappointed. It took an hour & a half to get there from the city & the queues were horrendous. We booked for the 8:15pm entry & arrived at 8:30pm to massive queues, after showing our tickets to the park officials we were told to go to the back of the queue. Thankfully I left my wife & son in the queue & headed up to an official on the entry gate, who said that we needed to enter now as the queue was for the 9:15 entry. (Something to be mindful of as not all staff were switched on). The Creatures of the night show was lame (Scripted & cheesy). The whole experience was an hour an 20 minutes, we then had another hour & half to get back to the hotel. We honestly didn't see many animals & felt this was over priced & our advise would be to go to the day zoo, you may have more luck. Sorry, a harsh review but just being honest."
,,Not recommended!!!,2.0,,"Theu have a open jeep with which take u to ride in an artificiallu created jungle in night where u can witness different animals which are kept in open... though for securitu reasons theu have digged a small hole in front of everu animals shelter so theu cannot cross the hole an come on the roads to seat and relax with u..
If u have plentu of time and nothing else to do in singapore then it would be perfect place to go"
,,3 hours queues for 30 tram ride and sleeping (or hiding) animals- I want a refund,1.0,,"Title says it all. We've enjoyed our stay in Singapore, but this was a total ripoff. To a level where almost all people in the park unanimously were complaining about it. SAVE YOUR MONEY. SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
,,"Good, but not as good as the zoo",4.0,,"The idea seems to be do either;

Zoo + night safari
Or
Zoo + river safari

We did zoo + night safari
Zoo is great. Night safari ok but it's a long day if you do both in one day. You queue up to get onto land trains. Each train has about 3 carriages of 20 people approx. We were in the rear carriage, unfortunately it works like this;

'Train' goes to the next stop in front of an animal enclosure, commentary explains what you are looking at. But in some cases at the rear carriage you can't see into the enclosure because you are too far back if you are in the third carriage and you only get a look once the carriage moves off.

There are numerous requests for everyone to keep quiet, but as you can imagine that falls on deaf ears.

However, despite these minor points the animals are great and the kids really enjoyed it."
,,Brilliant experience.,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the night safari, with both the tram trip and the walking trails both being excellent. The safari enabled us to see many brilliant animals while also learning about them. One thing worth mentioning would be the queues, while queuing didn't take away from our overall experience the 8:15 entrance had a long queue so we would suggest going a bit earlier.
Note: if you're a little bit fussy with food/trying to be healthy then the food selection we felt was rather limited."
,,Pretty Cool !!,4.0,,Went to the night safari via trolley tram which was a first and saw most of the nocturnal creatures come out. Definitly a different experience and worthwhile for the kids.
,,Nice Night Safari - Must visit by Tourists - A bit expensive,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. You can take a tram or walk. Must Visit for tourists. Suggest you take a tram first then walk later. Not good for tourists who are afraid of the dark. Cool to walk at night. Regards Dr Sim
,,Those who love safari. This is the best one,5.0,,The best time to visit here is during night. It's a place for those who love animals and adventures. Must go with friends. You'll see a lot of wild animals here.
,,very very hyped !!!,2.0,,"if u come from the Sub continent (INDIA, PAKISTAN,SRI LANKA, NEPAL) dont waste ur time visiting this place. u get to see animals which u commonly see around in your part of the country. Of all the animals in the safari 80% are different types of deer.
This is not all a Safari- at best.. a night visit to a zoo. Your local zoo would have more types of animals than this one in Singapore.

verdict :- its only hype which brings most of the people here."
,,"Long wait, ok experience.",3.0,,We went here after going to the singapore zoo. The wait was looking. Over 80 mins. We took the tram for the tour. If you visit or plan to visit the zoo you could skip this.
,,Great,4.0,,"Great place to visit. However, extremely crowded and fairly long lines and wait times. Once you are in the safari it is brilliant for the kids. Seeing the various animals is dependent on their habits at the time. Worth the visit if you can tackle the crowds."
,,Great night - Tips for your visit,4.0,,"Great night at the zoo, but talk about crowds!!

Tips

Arrive before your ticket time to line up! Arrive at least 30 min probably 45 before your ticket time.

Once you get in DONT GO ON THE TRAM. Everyone will rush for the trams. Instead start with the Wallaby Walkway. You will avoid the crowds and get great opportunity to observe the animals with few people about.

I would suggest going on the tram ride about 9:40pm there was no line then."
,,"Boring, long queues, not worth it.",1.0,,"Don't waste your precious time here, Singapore is such a beautiful city and you must spend all the time possible there during your stay.
It starts with a long queue, like 1 hour to 1 hour and a half just to get your entrance tickets. Then you move to another longer queue to enter the park, around 2 hours. Keep in mind that these queues are in an outside area, so super hot and thousand mosquitos surrounding you all the time to make it even more enjoyable while standing in the middle of a huge crowd of tourists. After entering the park, guess what? Another queue!!! This time for the tram ride. For the price you pay, exploring the park by walking tours must be a real bad joke they try to convince us that is not. So, after these 3 long long long, did I mention long?, queues, the time has come for you to enjoy a night safari on a tram. In one word, disappointing. You spend around 25 minutes to see around 10 different species, looking bored and depressed, with no reactions and totally inactive.
I didn't want to mention this, since most Singaporeans were super nice and friendly towards tourists, in this park it was an exception. Some staff was a little bit rude.

To sum it up, you waste around 5/6 hours to go on a disappointing 25 minute tram ride.
It's your choice now."
,,Such a long waiting queue!!,3.0,,It was very nice but we had a 1 year old with us who got so cranky with the whole wait in the line for 1 hour. We booked the 8.15 show and had to line up at around 7.30. And we had to stand in the same spot in a very crowded line for 30 minutes until the started the fire concert. That was very exhausting! But then the safari was nice and relaxing and interesting and beautiful.. the creatures of the night show was also very good
,,Go late to avoid queuing hell,4.0,,"The idea of a zoo that opens at night so you can watch nocturnal animals when they're awake is a good one. Overall, the night safari is a great experience, but if you can go later in the evening - say from 21.00 onwards - you'll have a far more pleasant time. If you arrive early, you'll face huge queues at the tram station and a long wait to see the excellent Creatures of the Night show. My best advice would be to arrive in time for the 21.30 show, sit on a higher row near an exit and then head for the tram. After the tram ride, you can experience the walking trails. The tram ride is worth doing as it takes you into areas of the park you can't access on the trails. However, it would be good if the driver also gave commentary as the taped commentary on board gets rather wearing and can't respond to any behaviours the animals are displaying during your ride. It's worth taking in the walking trails. The Fishing Cat and Leopard trails were my favourite and showed some animals you don't see from the tram. Walking through the dark jungle, breathing in the night flowering jasmine, and seeing lions awake and active is an experience I will never forget! If you can avoid the pushy crowds, you'll have a wonderful time at this unique attraction. Just one final word of advice - there are no accessible toilets in the tram station, so go to the ones in the restaurant and shopping area before heading to the entry gates, or you will have to exit, then enter again!"
,,Long unorganized Lines,2.0,,"So me and my girlfriend were very excited for the nights safari, as we both enjoy any type of wildlife experience. Unfortunately getting into the safari makes me question if it was worth going. We ordered our tickets online. Which was pointless. The line to get your online ticket printed was longer ban the line to buy tickets. After waiting in this line we thought we should buy the priority pass, but all we're sold out. We were there an hour before the show even started. Then we moved to the next line which was much much longer. We were lucky and got to see a fire show while waiting in line. Once we finally arrived it was a mad dash to the creatures of the night show. This was the highlight of the whole place. After that we took a tram and then walked around. Once inside it was fun, but the lines and chaos of getting in was just terrible, and it seems like they should be able to figure this out. Also one of there elephants was swaying terribly which is a sign of distress. This was the worst I've ever seen an elephant it made me feel guilty for buying a ticket."
,,"I liked the night ambiance, the atmosphere, the animals",4.0,,"I enjoyed it for the experience the night walks give.

I recommend the 7:15pm to avoid the crowd and just go for the walks.

I would not recommend the tram (I think the walk allowed us to see a lot more and avoid the queue).
I would not recommend the night show - too few animals- too much talking from my perspective.

I really recommend the walks, the experience is amazing and I like the conditions in which the animals are. It looks like their environment is as close as possible to their natural habitat.

I loved it."
,,What's all the hype about? Don't do it.,1.0,,"Overpriced. Overcrowded. Overrated.
I had been told by many previous visitors that the Night Safari was an absolute must. After visiting for myself I'm not entirely sure why. We booked online prior to our arrival in Singapore, I'd strongly recommend this for quicker entry into the park. We paid one of the open-top bus companies for our transfers. I actually enjoyed the journey there more than the attraction itself. We were booked onto the 8:30pm tour. We queued for more than one hour 30 minutes to get into the attraction. It was poorly managed, chaotic and stiflingly hot. When we eventually boarded one of the 'trams' we embarked on a 40 minute journey around the zoo. The concept is fantastic and if it were to be better organised I'm sure this could be a super attraction. The tour guide on the tram was knowledgeable and reeled off his script without hesitation, he'd clearly done it a few times. Due to the length of the queues we missed the 'Creatures of the Night Show'. If you are planning a visit, go as early as possible so that you can fit in all that queueing. I feel we paid to spend an excruciatingly long time queuing for absolutely no reason. We managed to catch a glimpse of the Fire Show. But again, this was restricted due to the queuing. Once we disembarked from the tram, we had to leave the park almost immediately to catch the final bus back to the city which was at 10:30pm. Ensure you have arranged transport back to the city as it was crazily busy at 10:30pm and a mad rush for every cat, man, dog and woman to get their transport back to the city. It's such a shame that we couldn't have enjoyed this attraction more. The feeling of excitement once we were on the tram, travelling in darkness around the zoo was unfortunately completely overshadowed by the mismanaged queues. My advice: don't believe the hype."
,,"Good, and worth a visit",3.0,,"But it's very busy. We visited and the queues are crazy. Once inside, the walking trails are great, and there are definitely a few cool exhibits (the bat enclosure stands out for me).

The tram is supposed to be a great way to see more, but the queue looked like it was going to take upwards of an hour so we didn't wait. I don't think this was helped by the tram stops mostly being closed with only the one at the entrance being available on the night we visited. I think if we did this again, we'd pay for the queue jump for the trams. If you only have time for this, or the zoo, I'd say go for the zoo. It's definitely better."
,,Walking Trails,5.0,,"We had a 7.15 time slot and waited until 7.30 when que was smaller to go in. We saw the massive line up for the team and decided to do the walking trails first. There was no one around as everyone lined up for the trams so we practically had the walking trails to ourselves watching all the animals full of life. We also timed it perfectly and saw the lions, hyenas, sloth bears, tiger and possums getting fed! We enjoyed the night. We didn't bother with the tram - line was still long. You also got to see majority of the animals on the walking trails. People get off and jump straight back in line."
,,Long queues and scared animals,1.0,,"We waited an hour to get in the 8:15 time slot then there was another half hour queue for trams, so we decided to do a walking tour. The animals looked scared and are tied down so they can't move much at all, I felt sorry for them. Big disappointment, wish I knew this before I went!"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"We went to the zoo for the night safari. It was definitely an interesting activity, but I am not sure how much it was worth it. Some of the animals were asleep for example, or hiding and in the dark it was hard to see all of them. It is a nice idea though. The restaurants at the place serve fast food and they are not the best. It was very hard to chose a good one."
,,just dont go during night,2.0,,"too much to wait and trust me you dont even see anything , so better to visit during day , food is good at the restaurants"
,,Unrest money you will spend,5.0,,Wonderful experience great animals and stylish night out . Every thing at the zoo is brilliant . Five star .
,,Long Queue - could be managed better,3.0,,"I bought tickets online so did not stand in the queue to buy tickets and hence saved, but still spent about an hour queueing up for the tram!!
2000 people allowed every hour on a tram ride which is 40 min... 20 Trams in all with ~70 people in a tram.
If the tickets says 815, then que up @ 715 to be first in the queue for the tram, i reached at 830 and got onto the tram @ 1000 pm, by the time we were back there was nothing left.
Can be avoided if you are going for the Singapore Zoo"
,,Favourite night in Singapore!,5.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari is fantastic! We used RMG Tours to get there (hotel pick-up and drop off included) so the night was hassle-free. The safari is brilliant, we skipped the queues and got onto a bus that looped around the park explaining all the enclosures. It's really well run, newly renovated and an impressive layout.
I was hesitant at first because I naively wondered how different it would be from a generic zoo. Was I wrong! I was just so excited to see nocturnal animals out and about. Animals I've never seen before we're active and lively in the dim lights of the park. Fishing cats, African hyenas, night birds, pangolins, mouse deer, wild pigs; a whole set of animals you're aware of but haven't seen in a daytime zoo. Bring your walking shoes and water, you'll be running from enclosure to enclosure."
,,Great time,5.0,,We booked this last minute and was recommended to me by a work colleague and it was well worth it. It was very Jurassic park!!
,,Night safari was amazing,5.0,,"We heard about the night safari and thought since we went to many zoos already we'll try and see how it looks like at night. It was super awesome! Many animals that sleep during the day were awake (especially cat species). You can jump on a train and enjoy the animals from there or you can also walk through by yourself. We did both, both was great! Totally worth a visit."
,,Fantastic Zoo,5.0,,"I have attended this zoo during the day and nighttime (Night at the Zoo). Both were great fun, but I think I enjoyed the night tram tour most. It was like you were in the jungle with the animals. Also, food choices are good and alcohol is even available"
,,Don't listen to other reviews!!!,5.0,,"The Night Safari is an attraction you have to visit in Singapore, it offers a completely different experience and is a chance to also walk along jungle paths. If you do plan to go queues can be very long, we visited at 7:15 and waited outside from around 4:30! To try and miss the queue to get in make sure you are there before half six as it does get s bit crazy despite the staffs excellent efforts ( queue jumpers are usually taken out of line and for some reason people try to run?). The wait for the tram ride was about 40 mins for us but it went very quickly, we decided to go just before people were allowed in at 9:15 which worked out well. Don't miss out on the walk ways, they're very peaceful but watch out for mosquitoes and biting ants!!"
,,Getting Stale,3.0,,"After 20+ years in Singapore the Night Safari has always been one of my favourite activities. We had guests in town so decided to organise a trip. I would recommend that you buy tickets online i) to save queuing for tickets and ii) you will normally get a small discount. The first niggle was that it was not possible to buy tickets for locals (which is cheaper) and overseas visitors in the same transaction. We arrived and the queue of people waiting was huge, they stagger the flow of visitors by having different times to start. There is a tram system which goes round where you can see the animals in their native habitat and it is possible to get off at designated points and walk. There is a multi language audio system in front of each seat, which is useful as the guide does all commentary in English. However on the tram we caught it was not working which was a huge disappointment as there were a couple of Chinese speakers in our party who missed out on some of the experience. Talking of the tram the boarding system was somewhat chaotic and I do not remember it being like this previously and wonder whether the Night Safari has become a victim of its own success. One other annoyance was that there were many overseas visitors who did not speak English and the guide was constantly admonishing people for using flashlight on their cameras/phones and the message was not getting across because people did not understand. As it is now so international I feel the safari would benefit from some multi-language signage and/or speakers. The food and beverage is expensive so be warned and the entertainment (fire eaters etc) has not changed in many years, for the first time visitor not such an issue I suppose. To cap it all a lot of animals had decided to take the night off and there was not too much to see, which of course is a risk where there is an element of being as real to a natural environment as possible."
,,Chaotic queues,1.0,,"In my view don't go to the night safari on a day it is raining ... why?
- firstly when you think you book a ticket for a fixed time 8:15 for example all this means is you can ""go in from"" this time ... it guarantees nothing else.
The queue for the tram is chaos and v long - over 1 hour for me. If it's raining some of the shows maybe cancelled and no one wants to walk the trails .. so everyone queues for the tram ...
And then everyone leaves at the same time and wants to get in the same bus or taxi...
Don't do it...
I imagine if it's a nice dry evening and you are not in the tourist season then the walking tour could be very nice...
Advice for the park - sort out the tram queue system and the number of taxis back at the end of the evening."
,,If your idea of fun is.....,2.0,,"Standing for hours in a never moving queue full of crying children and frustrated angry patents, then this is the place for you.
Its not organised chaos, its just chaos.
Either they let way too many people in or they have far too few trams as the huge queues just never seem to move.
At times I thought I was more likely to see a dodo than a tram.
Don't worry about what time you pre book because it bears no resemblance to the actual time you'll eventually get into the safari.
Chuck in a drop of rain, which ensures all the shows are cancelled and it just adds to the utter frustration of standing in the same spot for an hour.
The chances of you actually seeing any animals is pretty remote because by the time you do get in, if the animals aren't asleep, you probably will be !
If I had the choice of returning here for free or visiting the dentist, I'd take my chance in that big leather chair every time.
Come on night safari, sort this mess out quick."
,,Safari,3.0,,"We did the night time safari. Good God. It's an hour and a half ride out and back by bus or a 30 minute ride each way by cab. $30 each way by cab. Don't do the bus. You have to sign up for the 1915, 2015 or 2115 tram for the nighttime safari. Even then you have to get in line. There are a million people there. Loud screaming people. And it's hot. The line to get on the tram took 50 minutes. Don't do the animal show beforehand. It's a waste of time. The actual tram safari is nice and you see the animals at night but good lord, it's painful to do."
,,Horribly long queues!!! DON'T DO IT!!,2.0,,Do not waste your money. We stood for an hour and a half in long snaking lines just to be on a 30 minute tram ride seeing animals in the dark. Waste of my money and ended up with really irritated kids. Never ever again and would NOT recommend to anyone!!!!
,,Too crowded,3.0,,"Although large crowds are managed, overall disappointment. Pre purchased ticket but still line up unless an organised tour. We were on Hop On Hop Off bus tour and only had time for tram ride and one show in amphitheatre once we had queued for everything."
,,Nice,5.0,,Nice view. New scenic way of going to the zoo. Most coutries are in the day however this is unique. Recommended
,,Rrroooarr!,3.0,,"Yup. Roar! That may be all that you will hear cos most of the time (unless you're equipped with night-vision device), you'll be hearing roars and whistles, but unable to see animals. Some maybe obvious, but the dim (natural) lighting will not help if you also have night-vision problems.

Skip this, even though you can get an all-access pass that may save you some money. Trust me, the return-trip (if you're travelling by public transport) is not fun at all with the crowds all competing to get out of Mandai zoo at once.

Be patient. Exercise lots of patience. Do not harm any animals, and humans."
,,Worth it,5.0,,I can't remember how much I paid for this but from what I do know it is well worth your time. Especially the tour which is exciting and fun!
,,Fantastic 'adventure' for all the family,5.0,,"What an fabulous experience this was for our family, myself aged 37, husband 34, son 8 and daughter 4. We booked before arriving in Singapore and were delighted with apparent queue jumper tickets for the train which took us all around the main features of the safari, including the Asian elephant, lion, tiger, giraffe and much more. We then had some good on the restaurant which was a decent experience, certainly better than any you would get in a UK Safari or zoo. My son and I then took a walk around the safari which was not to missed especially the up close encounters with the Malayan tiger and hyenas. My husband and daughter chose the Creatures of the night show and were wowed by the many different animals and their recycling and fishing, amongst other things. Wouldn't have missed this experience for the world and would definitely recommend for families with young children for an awesome adventure."
,,Worst attraction in Singapore,1.0,,"Went o the night safari after purchasing tickets in town only having to wait another hour in a line at the park. By the time that I had made it to the counter it was going to be over 3 hours after starting the trip to getting in!!!.
The crown must have been over 20000 people and the service. Was the worst thAt I have seen at any zoo in my travels.

We left before seeing the attraction but people on the bus said it was second rate at best.

This attraction is just a money grabbing business and the worst in the world that I have found.

Can't believe the reviews that it has

Only good thing was Duck and Hippo tour company gave a refund. They have provided good service for their tours."
,,Queue all day.,1.0,,"if you enjoy queuing you will love it. The queues are terrible. I arrived at 6pm, had dinner then queued until 8:40pm to get on the tram. I didn't actually get on the tram. I gave up because my child was beyond frustrated and fell asleep. A waste of time.

And yes I booked in advance online. It didn't help at all.

It is also surprisingly family unfriendly. For example no handy nappy change facilities."
,,Too overcrowded for little kids,2.0,,"People had warned us weekends were busy so we purposely went on a Thursday evening. Well, it was nothing more than organised chaos! People shoving and pushing to get through the gates and onto the trams, long lines and general craziness. The kids were not impressed. Things settled down a little once we were in and walking around but the animals were difficult to see in the dark - many of them asleep! If you have a choice between the zoo and the night safari and your kids are under ten, I would recommend the zoo any day of the week!"
,,Awesome as I remembered,5.0,,"The night safari is a must when in Singapore, make sure you book tickets in advance. There is a lot there when combined with the other parks, but the night safari on its own was good and exciting for the children age 9 & 7 . They enjoyed the fire-eaters as it was a fair 40 minute wait until we could go in.
The animals look well cared for and the audio guide although recorded is up to date. You are able to get off at certain points and walk around to then meet the land train a bit later on."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Seeing the same animals at night, while you are sitting in a tram/cart - if that excites you, then go for it. It didn't amuse me that much. The fact that the place is super-crowded all the time (although the management of crowd is done very well), and one has to wait in queues, makes it even less attractive."
,,Night adventure.,5.0,,"Book early and come refreshed. The experience was brilliant and we admired how the staff manage the thousands of visitors that wait. The show is a must and presented with humour and valuabke information. We had had a very busy day so were exhausted by the time we arrived, but loved the experince. Great walks and the tram ride is a must. Food is pricey, so come having already had supper."
,,Worst experience,1.0,,"The night safari was highly forgettable...literally queued for hours from the time I had our Go Singapore passes validated till the time my two boys & I got on the tram.
The Zoo is running at well above capacity; herding us all like cattle & barking out orders to alleviate their own poor handling of the situation. All you needed was floodlights; a loud speaker; fearsome dogs & guys with funny looking crosses on their uniforms to complete the picture!"
,,Expect to Queue for approx two hours past your time slot and miss the animal show completely,1.0,,"I have visited the Night Safari on 3 separate occasions and had a great experience, but after my 4th visit last night I will never go again.
In the past, you paid for your ticket and joined the queue for the tram ride. Easy, expected a queue, got a queue, usually for about 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour.
Last night we arrived at 8pm, and was told we couldn't enter the park until 9:15 time slot, but we could go to the river safari while we waited - don't bother.
We then attempted to enter the park at our time slop of 9:15pm , and then queued for 45 minutes to get into the park ! Missing the 9:30 animal show, So we queued with three bored children for a further 1 hour 15 minutes to get on a tram ! nightmare! Also missing the last animal show ! It was so late after our tram ride, by this time we decided to miss the walking trails and go home.
Then there was the taxi queue from hell to contend with.

I have to ask, why try to coral every visitor into one of four time slots ? it just creates a log jam of people!

I was so disappointed after bigging the experience up to family only to see disappointment on their faces !"
,,Visit only if you are ready to explore the trails,4.0,,"The night safari tends to get very crowded with queues to redeem tickets, enter the park and the tram ride. If you only plan to go on the tram ride and watch the show, you can give this place a miss since the queues do not make it worth it as the tram queues can take anywhere between 1-2 hours.

The walking trails are spectacular and should not be missed. These also tend to be less crowded, so you can take your time to look for the animals and get good photos. We went on the trails first and the tram right at the end when the queue was much shorter.

Avoid weekends (Friday and Saturday nights) since the crowds get overwhelming. The staff is generally polite, but they tend to get a little flustered due to the number of people visiting. The night safari management could seriously think of ways to limit the excessive crowding."
,,Late busy but good fun,2.0,,"Then park opens at 7pm, but by this time it is heaving. The park is congested to bursting point. We took a taxi to the park which was fairly inexpensive but you can take a bus and then get onto the mrt. With a tourist pass this would be the cheapest option. The queues seemed to go on forever, the main queue was for the bus tour. With a waiting time of 40.minutes. much to my amazement the kids in the queue were really well behaved. Though some were flagging. There was a fire dance show given by two men which was a crowd pleaser and quite enjoyable. Plus there was also the option of being able to visit the river safari for free after 7pm. The river safari had 3 tanks only and the rest of the attractions were closed but it was free!
The walking trails were good but there is alot of up.and down walking so not great in the heat. But on the upside the trails were super fun for the kids. They seemed to love it and there were lots fo eating places. Overall the waiting for the safari was a bit of a shamble but the walks were good fun. There were 3 in total. There should have been a shuttle to pick up walkers who want to make their way back to the main foyer but this was suspended due to the high number of visitors. We went for a second trip on the safari bus at the end of the evening, that was at 11.30pm and it was really good there were no queues and we Walked straight onto the safari bus- but by then some of the animals had disappeared or were lazing about in crevices and the undergrowth. If you're coming from the west from countries like England or America then the timing may not be so much of an issue.
lots of food places to chose from so refreshments weren't an issue.
The heat is hard work if you're walking but the kids seem to find something exciting about being in the dark with a map.
If you can keep your cool in the long line for the safari ride then you may enjoy this experince. At 45 sd per ticket,it can get expensive."
,,Too crowded and queueing for most things,1.0,,"I would give the night safari a miss until things are improved. The day zoo is so much better (must go).

We had complimentary tickets so we didn't have to queue fortunately. At around 8pm, the queue to purchase entrance tickets are still very long. When we entered with our tickets although without having to queue, we felt like we were immediately ""herded"" towards the ""next"" queue which was for the animal show at 8.30pm. There were so many people in the queue (not a line) and the place looks like a chaos and we felt so pressurized. IMHO, it's chaotic from the start. I must give credits to the marshall who were trying their best to keep things a little organized though. (some of them are shouting!)

The 8.30pm animal show is not so interesting. Same old thing I have seen since about 10 years ago.

Queues to take trams is also quite long (10mins). Tram ride around the zoo is finally quite relaxing to be fair, but mostly you will see deers. There used to be fishing cats but no where to be seen during this visit."
,,Must do,5.0,,It's a once in a life time experience and you'll be contributing to a good cause as their money goes towards protecting endangered animals..make sure you see the fire show
,,Print your online ticket @ Spore Zoo Self Print Kiosk,4.0,,"- went on Sunday night, 7.15pm slot.
- Came around 5pm, and there are already about 100 people queing, but the door not yet open.
- If you have booking code from online tickets, please print the ticket at singapore zoo self print ticket. No queue, and really will save your time.
- Around 5.45pm (I think), they open the entrance door, and people run to the ticket booth. Many people confused about queue line / redeemed ticket, priority, and groups.
- After you get your real ticket, stay around the ice cream shop. Thats the first queue line (line will open at 6.30pm).
- There are 4 lines, 3 for reguler,1 for member/priority. Many people walked on the right side where there is a sign TRAM 4 and 5, its for groups, and ticket with tram express with multi language, extra pay for this. This line also going to Food court.
- Around 6.30pm, queue line open till in front of the jeep, then you have to wait till 7pm.
- 7pm, the Fire man show. If you want to have a good view, queue at 1 line ( left side near jeep) or sitting area at the chicken restaurant beside ticket booth.
- After the fire show, then the night safari finally open.
- After they scanned your ticket, there are 3 options: go left to the walking trail, go straight to the tram queue (the bamboo line), or go right to the animal show.
- queuing tram was not bad, because i was early.
- tram came every 5 or 10 minutes, and each time, 3 tram x 6 or 8 seat and 4 persons each seat. Tram experience was good, although not every animal can be seen. No use to take picture as it is too dark. No flash are allowed. You can only ride 1 time, if you want more, you have to queue again.
- queuing line to the animal show is near the Tram 4 and 5 station. Long queue but not as long as the entrance and tram.
- show was good, and the amphetheathre can fit many people.

For those who are going to Night Safari... good luck in queing! (But its worth to see animals at night)"
,,"Queuing, chaos and missed animal show",2.0,,We had the 48 h Duck & Hippo Hop-on/off tickets and then the transfer to the night safari was included. We paid extra for the entrance fee to the safari. We took the first bus to be sure being on the first night safari tram. Arriving to the Zoo it was chaotic. First tram left at 19.00. We were in line from 18.45 and left 19.45 (not fun). When we arrived back after round 30 minutes the night animal show at 20.30 was full and we could not attend the last show being able to catch the transfer back. This took 4-5 hours of our evening for being on a night tram for 30 minutes seeing a few animals in the dark. Sorry but really not worth it. Either you need to go earlier with another transfer to be sure being first in line also being able to se the animal show or maybe better stay in the city and enjoy a great dinner some where. We do not recommend this activity.
,,Very disappointing,1.0,,"Had read & heard god reviews. Very disappointed. Took over an hour and half to get there by MRT & bus from near Raffles. Very crowded & chaotic at the entrance. Tram tour was nothing special & the show was terrible - left before the end.

Have been to zoos all around the world (including Singapore Zoo in day time (which was excellent) and was looking forward to the Night Safari.

Sadly this visit was very disappointing."
,,Chaos isn't even close,2.0,,"If you've been to a Disney theme park you'll
know how good their queueing system is - especially if it's very crowded. The Night Safari is the complete opposite.
Our tickets were for 9.15pm. By 8.45, the queue was snaking round the courtyard in an uncontrolled fashion with people apparently just joining where they felt like it.
Eventually the snake started to move, then stop, then move, then completely stop for about 15 minutes. Eventually we got to the ticket barrier at about 9.40, to be shown to another queue for the trams that we were told was another hour's wait.
So 9.15 tickets meant getting on a tram at 10.45pm. Ridiculous.
The ride itself was good, but a 2 hour wait? Appalling management."
,,Didn't meet our high expectations,3.0,,"The Night Safari was highly recommended but to be honest, we found it quite dull. The animals were all there to be seen but they were mostly still. Almost like models though they obviously weren't.

Unfortunately, our trip took place in torrential rain so perhaps this is partly why we were disappointed.

The buffet food was excellent and plentiful but a price of $13.50 for one SMALL beer is outrageously expensive even for Singapore."
,,Mixed outcome,3.0,,"I would say it's a good attempt to do something different but need more attention , very long queues, that have tram rides but not stoping where there are animals so that the guest can take pictures. So whole point of going in the night to see animals is taken away as you can't take any photos in this tram ride , I recommend to walk but don't know if it's allowed as I didn't see anyone walking. They have a show which is waste if time ."
,,Exciting,2.0,,"Location:- Night safari is easily assessible from most of the places.
Though there were various kind of animals they all seemed so sleepy!!
The most negative thing about nightsafari was the long que. It was such a huge que to enter in to the park . It took us more than an hour and a half to get into the safari train. We were already tired with the wait . We were all thirsty n sweaty with humidity."
,,Expect two hours cueing even if you booked a specific time slot,1.0,,Need to book well in advance and nevertheless you will spend two hours cueing before you actually do anything Disappointing and overpriced
,,Long queues - be prepared!,3.0,,"We visited with our children aged 11 and 14. Having enjoyed the water safari during the afternoon, we expected great things for the night safari. We had pre-booked the 8:15 tour, and wrongly expected that it was an allocated time for us to take the tram ride. Instead, we had to start queuing from 7:15 to get a reasonable place in the queue for the 8:15 tour. We then had to queue for another 40 mins to get on the tram. After the tram ride, we decided to leave, as we were concerned that we would have to queue a considerable time to get the 138 bus back to the MRT. The Tram tour was interesting, but the enclosures are very small (for the number of animals housed in each one). This could be a really good attraction, but the organisation is very poor."
,,Just an average place,3.0,,"This is much hyped place, though in realty its just okay kinda place. You will roam around here and see animals which you can normally find in any zoo. Only activity of attraction is their animal show which takes place at night. though i must say that for kids its a nice place to keep them exciting and engaged."
,,Visit with Family,4.0,,"It had been years since my visit to the Night Safari. Tickets were quite expensive considering there are not discounted rates for Singaporeans. We have to book tickets online and we were not aware that we have to queue before going in as the entry is limited to certain number of tickets in an hourly schedule.
We had to queue for close to an hour before we can go in, by then our young kids were pretty much restless.
However, the experience in there were very awesome. We managed to get pretty up close and personal with the night animals. Signages were visible with guides stationed at every interval so visitors don't get lost.
The not-to-be-missed part of the Night Safari is the night performance, tram ride and the animal show.
Will go back again should they have a promotion (hopefully soon)."
,,Night safari,3.0,,Singaporean birthday go Night Safari is free. It is just a simple walk through only. And can take a boat ride for an hour. The best part is to see the China panda and the whole premises is aircondition. The whole journey took last than 3 hours.
,,Great visit,4.0,,"The night safari is very well organised. As you enter you will either do the outdoor show or the tram ride first.

Expect large crowds no matter the night.

The food at the restaurants is only fair.

The exhibits are very good, well laid out and informative. It is special to see the animals at night and that is what makes this zoo so special."
,,Unique Zoo Experience,5.0,,"The Singapore Zoo is still one of the best in the world (in my opinion) with it's open design, cleanliness and innovative displays/shows. So the Night Safari next door has a high bar to reach. And, in its unique way - it delivers. The tram ride is a great way to see the expansive array of animals that are usually well hidden during the day. And be sure to hop off at the scheduled stations for some additional viewing. Since it is at night, you have the added bonus of cooler temps too! It's worth considering the combo ticket with the Zoo if you have the time. Well worth the visit."
,,Found it okay,3.0,,We took the tram ride only and didnt find it too impressive as most of the animals are commonly seen across the south asian countries at least. It didn't live up to tge expectations but still a good way to get a glimpse of night life in a forest.
,,Different zoo experience!,4.0,,"We were wondering if the night safari was worth the visit. Reason being that we've been to zoos before and they're all approximately the same. However, visiting the night safari was a different experience. Watching the animals at night time - which is when most of them are the most active - was great! Make sure to have enough time for both the walk and the train ride. Do also visit the show if accompanied by children."
,,Great Sights!,5.0,,This was worth every penny too! Singapore at night is amazing! A must do excursion! we had a good guide too!
,,Night Safari in Singapore,1.0,,"Nothing to see.... Just wasted money >> If you want to see wild animals, you should go in the day time >>> It looks good on the pictures >>> that is avertizing to make money"
,,"Not worth the money, effort & hard work combined :(",2.0,,"I have been to Night Safari before - probably in 2010. I went again this time just to give my son the same experience and it had felt like a mistake. It is the park with the same creatures but 7 years' apart, the experience had been just the opposite.

The queue was huge. I mean HUGE. One a weekday, I really had not expected the place to be so much crowded. We had our tickets booked in advance and thus we could only save us from the queue to get the tickets on spot. We had reached half an hour ago and to get in, we had to wait in queue (which was not organized; courtesy: overzealous tourists) without not much space to breathe. It was hot, humid and smelly. Once we got in, we decided to go for the show first and I have to say the quality of the show has deteriorated. We left probably 5-10 minutes before the show ended and then were faced with another HUGE queue to get onto the tram. If we did not have our 8 year old with us, we would have just let the tram tickets get wasted and either had left or tried on foot. I think we waited for nearly 45 minutes before we could get on a tram. I think by then we were too tired to enjoy the ride and the animals.

I don't think I will go back to Nigh Safari ever again. Even my son (who simply loves animals) has not been too ecstatic about it."
,,Sleepy safari,2.0,,"I don't like to give negative feedback cause different people like different things. But on the whole when you go to see something you want to take away something happy and positive and remembering it to be something you enjoyed.
I remember the no flash photography hence no good photos. Sleepy tired or no show animals which is fine, but, disappointing when you've paid good money. All the food and drinks and snacks were so high it made our cinema food prices here in Australia look reasonable. You would need to get transport there and back depending where you stayed so that's more $$$
You were taken slowly round in a safari open sided train/buggy motorised long vehicle with a guide in the front seat commentating. Very dark and not good night lighting so it really was nothing much to see. You could walk round but not everywhere and really I Would not do it again - wasted money and time."
,,Appallingly disorganised,3.0,,"Visited here on a Sunday night. On the advice from the hotel concierge we arrived 30minutes early. We thought that having pre-bought tickets with the bar code on a phone we would have been scanned and let in for our chosen slot. We couldn't have been more wrong. The entrance of the zoo resembled a unbelievably crowded station with no one having any idea where to be. We were then told we had to queue to pick up paper tickets (???). After 15minutes in one queue to discover we were in the wrong queue. This happened again. Whilst we were waiting in the right queue our slot time had come and gone and we then were told the next slot had sold out. This meant that having got there at 6.45 we had to wait till 9.15 for an available slot.
We decided to wait as the money had already been spent on taxis, tickets etc. Only then to be told that as it had rained we were unlikely to see some of the animals and that we could only go and do 1/3 of the river cruise. When we finally got through at 9.25 to the safari it was again chaotic and we had to push our way through hoards of Chinese who have no sense of queuing etiquette.
The safari itself was good. Only lasted 40minutes and I'm not sure it was worth the 3hour wait.
For a country that prides itself on technology I can't help feeling that the system can be made easier, more straight forward with less waiting if bar codes and scanners were used more effectively. Also if there were clear signs to tell people what to do/where to queue etc. We had to wait while it was raining in the food court which wasn't bad, but again disorganised.
All in all, don't visit at the weekend and be prepared to queue. Arrive 1 1/2 hours early!"
,,Simply Amazing!!!,5.0,,"Had an amazing time at the night safari with the family.

The park have really thought this through in relation to the treatment of the animals and the visitors experience. The night trails you can do before or after the tram ride are simply amazing to be able to get that close to such beautiful animals without impacting them too much is amazing.

The only negative is the 45 minutes plus waiting in queues to get onto the tram... but I don't know how else the park could make that better when you consider the volume of guests they are trying to process through the park.

Me and the family will never forget this experience!!!"
,,Best zoo experience ever!,5.0,,"If I could use one word to describe the experience, I will use 'awesome'!! Please do make sure you at least spend 1 night for night safari at Singapore zoo. You can observe animals as close as within 10m and take one hour tram to experience the zoo. After the tram ride, you can also spend 30 mins for a really fun animal show. After the show, you will spend at least 1 hour to go through 4 trails to get a closer look at the animals. Highly recommended!"
,,Get ready to see the animals as never before,4.0,,"The tram ride is the best way to explore the sights. Get up close to the huge beats & the other small animals with the voice over explaining the features of the animal. The experience is worth it. For the more adventurous, you can always take the walking trails. The food options are also huge here."
,,Suitable for children,5.0,,It's a bit far from town. I advised y'all to take MRT instead of taxi. This is place for family with young children. My kid just loved it so much. So much to see.
,,Good experience,4.0,,The night Safari was a good experience. The creatures of the night show was a waste of time as the presenter kept talking and repeating not to take flash photography but not many well trained animals doing tricks. The fire tribal dance was worth seeing and the tram ride was well organised but dimly lit areas so we could not see all the animals clearly.
,,Completely Over Rated,2.0,,"I dont know if we chose a wrong day.. But in a off season, on a wednesday - this place was over crowded like crazy.. Got worst seats at the Creature of Night show.. It was more a show of the presenter than creatures. By mistake chose to take tram instead of walking trail. Got stuck in Queue & Took 2.5 hrs to get to the tram. And after getting in - got to see PIGS, DEER , DEER & MORE DEER. Hardly 1 tiger, 2 lion, 2-3 elephant..
May be walking trail wud have been better"
,,3 hours of chaotic queuing and squinting in the dark,1.0,,Save your family paying $40+ each by turning the brightness right down on an ipad and watching a nature program from 20 foot away. You'll still see more wildlife and wont have to deal with rude families barging ahead of you in countless hot queues all night.
,,"Very poor organisation, overrated and long queues",2.0,,"I rarely give bad reviews but this experience was not good. The 7.15 queue was so long and when the gates opened everyone dashed to trams and the night show like no tomorrow. We had small kids so felt very stressed and when we arrived the night show..the views we got were obstructed and the show not very good.
The trams were so long over an hour that we walked with the small kids for half the trail. Most animals were awake but difficult to glimpse in the dark.
We tried to catch the tram halfway at point 2 and 3 and 4 but as no one got off..we then had to walk all the way back to find yet another hour long queue.
The area is much overrated and not suitable for young kids due to very poor planning. It is such a shame as it would have been a good experience if they only organised it better. Would.not recommend this for young kids unless prepared for very long queues or walk the whole way in the dark."
,,"Don't Make This Mistake!!! Wrong queue, Late Tickets",3.0,,"Apologies for the wordy review, I'm including details of mistakes, food, tram and exploring.

I'm seeing recent reviews of people getting there without a ticket and being angry that they didn't get one. You've got two options, either be there hours before, like 5PM (I personally have not tried this) to purchase a ticket (not recommended) or PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE. Cannot stress that enough. There's a huge crowd even on weeknights! (went there on a Wednesday evening), and the place was packed, the queue was insane! We got on the tram for 8:10 (not sure what time it starts, but there's 3 schedules, 7, 8 and 9) I got the 8PM one to be safe, and accidentally arrived there at 6PM. LOL!

The staff by the gate did not allow queuing for 8PM yet, and they said we could be back by 7:45. We ate at the restaurant on the left side ( I forgot the name), I strongly recommend you get the whipped/mashed potato with chicken gravy, it's sooo good. Tip: You might see the coke overpriced, it's because it comes with a cool container :) I think it's worth it haha

I started to see people queue by 7:30 so I went in and the staff allowed me to. The queue is long, but to my surprise it's kinda moving? Well, each tram takes a lot of people after all, so yeah. There's two places to queue, the one you get in, and the one across, I felt so excited when they allowed us (we were first in line) to cross, only to be disappointed that they actually made us wait for around 6 more rounds (dont know how much time I waited) so if you can, stay on the first queue and don't go across (I may need an explanation as to what happened there. I got so pissed because while we were on the other side, the people BEHIND US, like WAAAAY behind us, got on the tram faster than we did WTF!!!! Because they stayed on the original side (mind you, we did not cross because we were impatient, we only crossed to the other side because the staff told us to) Really pissed at that point, and I'm pretty sure everyone on my side was too! The staff didn't even bother explaining why we had to wait, and the other side already had 6 rounds of tram!!! so annoying! I took one rating because of that experience, a good explanation would have stopped all of us from being pissed.

Anyways, the great part is that the animals are out and about during the tram ride.
Please don't use flash photography, it annoys the animals, the staff and the other passengers who get scolded by the staff because of the inconsiderate person.
Some parts smell like poop (well it is a zoo after all). Prepare to walk, wear comfy walking shoes.

Is Creatures of the night worth staying? Unfortunately I was with people who were tired (late 40's) and I missed it :("
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Slow paced over crowded experience with very limited views of wildlife. Unsurprisingly difficult to see anything in the dark, yet somehow we expected more.

The Nocturnal Animal Show was slow with about a third of people leaving during the performance. Corny jokes but more irritating was the insistence of the muppets on using flash photography after 20+ pleas not to do so.

If you must go, do a tour to avoid HUGE queues."
,,"Good, but could be better with better planning",4.0,,"If we were to visit again, we would see the whole park by foot first, then leave the tram ride till the end. Tram rides are 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm. We selected the 8:15pm ride and lined up at 7:45pm (thinking half an hour is plenty of time), but there were already hundreds of people in the queue. We did not board our tram until 9:10pm and due to this, we missed out on over half the park and the shows. My 5yo boy was so disappointed. Otherwise, it is great to visit the animals at night."
,,They allowed people to push in front in the lines and were generally unable to cope,1.0,,"I had NEVER been anywhere in Singapore I did not enjoy until I went to this dump. Upon my return home I wrote to these clowns about the terrible treatment and poor control of the queues etc. They promised me a refund, but it never came. That was after sending them my bank details etc. To be completely frank, the whole thing was a bit useless anyway. Too many people made the crowds too noisy which in turn meant there were less animals to see. I'd suggest going elsewhere."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"I have been to all the other wildlife parks in Singapore and found this to be the least enjoyable. It may be because we went on a weekend night but the crowds were unbelievable. The 7.15 entry time is the most popular and there is just a sea of people waiting to get in and then queuing for the tram. We purchased the express pass to book a guaranteed tram time and we still had to queue for some time to get on this. I was hoping the animals would be more active at night but a lot of them were asleep or not visible and being night time you cannot see them very well anyway! It was all a bit underwhelming and I think the River Safari and the Bird Park are much better. The highlight was the excellent tandoori chicken we had from the Indian food outlet - warning all open air, no air conditioning in this area."
,,Night Safari....not quite what we'd expected,3.0,,"OK, so it was interesting to see the animals on the tour 'tram', but the rest of the experience wasn't really what we had in mind.

We went on a Sunday evening - perhaps extra busy?? - We arrived at 18:30 for our 19:15 booking, but had no idea that we had to queue for that 45mins in a queuing pen - and when we went through at about 19:30 there were hundreds of us, all encouraged to go through to see the Night Creatures show.

After the show we had another 30mins+ queue for the tram ride, after which we had to run to get the bus we wanted back to town. There were food & beverage outlets there, but we didn't have a chance to use them (though they didn't look too interesting, to be honest).

Nice idea, but far too many people allocated the time slot, and I think the Zoo are trying to fit too many people in, such that it is affecting the quality of the experience!"
,,huge disappointment,1.0,,"we went to this 2 years ago and loved it. unfortunately the zoo hasn't kept up its standards with the ever increasing crowds. we went by taxi to arrive before 7.30. the numbers allowed in the park meant that 7.30 and 8.30 had sold out. we waited until 9.30, missed the 'animals of the night""show and ended up only doing the tour by electric train - which is a very expensive train ride. a huge disappointment. if you want to go and see it, plan ahead, book online and make sure you do the early shows."
,,Just as great second time round,5.0,,"It took a while for the tour group to get onto the bus and to the safari park. Once there we were fast tracked onto the carts that would take us round the park. It is a great opportunity to see the animals that are not readily available to see at home in New Zealand. Opportunity to go along the trails, which would have been fun, was turned down in favour of watching the night safari show. There was also a fire show on offer. Time was against us. we did have a wonderful choice of places to eat from. the food was delicious and the prices reasonable. The night show with the animals was just as much fun as I remembered. The 'piece d' resistance' at the end of the show causing just as many gasps as when I saw it last time. The tour did feel a little hurried, but only because we were slightly late starting. A fun night out."
,,Super crowded!! Arrived 8:30pm also cannot watch 9;30pm show!,4.0,,"My family do not want to go at the first place. Them because of the show, we went! Weekday last show is 9:30pm! We arrived at 8:30pm. Then start to queuing, by 9:00pm we can manage to get in! N when we were in, we find that the show is full! (Think it is HK n China school summer holiday?! Super crowded! Even in weekdays. Advise go earlier)

The tram which go around the zoo is around 30mins. If u do not know english, u have to bring headset, u can plug ur headset to the language u wanna listen in the tram.

I tried both tram n walk. Personally i think on foot and walk around by ourself is much much more fun!! It takes around 1.5 -2 hrs to finish if on foot. (Go to washroom b4 u start ur walking journey. Toilet is at entrance n in each tram stations)"
,,Customer service needs improvement,3.0,,"The park itself was quite interesting but we had a major disappointment with the ""major attraction"" - the Creatures Of The Night Show. At the ticket desk we asked whether there was space on the 21:30 show, we were assured that there was and so we bought tickets. In the queue to enter the park the electronic billboard displayed the timings for the show: 19:30, 20:30, 21:30, and 22:30. Once we got in (queue was under 5 min) we were told rather rudely that the 21:30 show was full. So we asked when we should arrive for the 22:30 and were bluntly told that there was no 22:30 show. We were really disappointed and were met with no sympathy, told that that show was only on certain days, despite the billboard outside showing no information to that end.
The safari was decent but the mood was spoiled by the disappointment.
They offer a tram with an English speaking commentary but the queue was long for that and took up half our time there at the park. There are walking trails available which I would recommend as there's less people in your way and you can avoid the noisy people on the tram too."
,,Poor ticketing system,3.0,,"I bought discounted tickets for the Night Safari using a Handy tourist phone that are given to guests at certain hotels. Family tickets for 2 adults and 2 young children came to SGD 113 for ""flexible tickets"". So it was definitely cheaper than going direct through the official website. The ""flexible tickets"" allows you to enter at any of the set times (7.15pm, 8.15pm, 9.15pm and 10pm). However, this does not guarantee that you will get in at any of the entry times with a ""flexible ticket"" as they can sell out. I arrived at 8.15pm and was told that it was sold out but could only enter at 9.15pm. I asked the ticket desk if I had booked for a 7.15pm entry and missed the entry time then could I get into the 8.15pm time slot? Yes. So, in future, buy a 7.15pm ticket online and if you miss the entry time you can still get in for the later entry times. Does not make sense, but that's how it works!

Because it was the 9.15pm entry time everything was rushed and the children were ready for bed by 10pm. Shame because there is a lot to explore, but not when you can only enter past 9pm."
,,Definitely a visit if your in Sinagpore,5.0,,"If you want to avoid the heat and walking around the zoo then the Night Safari tram ride is the one to do! We've been 3 times now that we've been to Singapore and loved it all 3 times. Yes the journey on tram is short but lots of animals to see, lions, tigers, elephants you name them. You can also do the wallaby trail on foot which u can see the other mammals like snakes and bears real close. A ""must do"" on your checklist if your visiting Singapore. A grand experience for the young and old"
,,A grand experience,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore,please visit here and have a great experience, traveling in the night and seeing various animals from all over world.Besides see the shows which are very interesting. You will get good discount if you purchase combined ticket with zoo or river safari.I will advice to drop out from the train at in between station and see the animals from a close range which is unbelievable .The arrangement for movement of trains and visitors are superb,A must place for children but adults will also love it."
,,Night Safari is the best in the Zoo,4.0,,"+ Awesome Tram ride or you can take a trail and walk to see animals
+ We could see tigers, Rhinos, Deers, Giraffe's etc.
- Queue for the tram was 1 hour although the tickets were purchased well in advance. The authorities should definitely do something about this. The tickets are not cheap and yet the queue is not managed well."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,Booked this through City Tours located at Esplanade Xchange and was picked up at the hotel on time by a friendly tour guide who was extremely knowledgeable about the tour and provided a superb experience. Make sure you get there early enough to see the live show before the safari commences. Be prepared to see some incredible animals lounging around in their habitat after sundown...the perfect way to see these gentle giants. Make sure also to catch the fire-eating/dancing show afterwards...amazing. Don't forget to try the delicious gelati afterwards...a welcome cooling treat in the humid Singapore weather.
,,Awful unless you love queues and screaming kids,1.0,,"Don't be tempted, it sounded so lovely but the experience was terrible. The queues were so horrendous we didn't get to see the attraction until well gone 10pm. Kids were screaming, parents were arguing and the level of pushing and jostling was like a sales day. Visitors are loaded onto a tram to see the animals after watching a show. The tram was roust and we couldn't wait for it to end. Save you're money and pick something else."
,,Visit,4.0,,An amazing experience to see the beautiful animals in their night life. The waiting time to ride the tram was only the downside but staff are very helpful.
,,Very long cueing,2.0,,The night safari tram is a very slow cueing process...took almost an hour for access the tram and we were close to the front. Over crowding leaves showtimes inaccessible. I thought the experience would have been better
,,Not worth the money or the wait,1.0,,"Bought online tickets to avoid queues, but the collection machines weren't working so we had to queue anyway. The queues for night safari were 2.5 hours and then the ""safari"" is sitting on a tram listening to some extremely cheesy narration for 40mins. Don't bother unless you like wasting money."
,,Over advertised but worth a visit,3.0,,"Our expectations were high, but we were somewhat disappointed. If you want to see lots of rare animals in a short time, it is a good tour, but it is really rushed as you drive through the zoo.
It was very chaotic at departure as all the action has to take place within a very short time span. If you can, and especially if you have small children with you, it is highly advised to go for priority boarding to avoid the waiting time.
Atter the tram ride our son and I went on the ""Wallaby Trail"", which hugely improved the experience as we were able to walk at our own pace and watch the animals. It was however sad to see the tiger, who was obviously very stressed walking the same 4 meters back and forth in front of the window.
All in all we wish we had gone for the day Zoo."
,,Not well organized,2.0,,Been to the zoo twice at it was amazing so expected the same at the night safari. Unfortunately was disappointed by the organization. Booked for the first slot and stood in queue for 30 min to enter. went to the show first as suggested by the staff and Stood in that queue for 30 min. When it was done stood in a 45 min queue for tram ride. While the animals were interesting to see they sell more tickets than the park can accommodate.
,,A bit over rated but enjoyable,3.0,,"A novelty being able to see some animals at night. Do not go there on an empty stomach or you risk spending as much on the food as you did the entrance fee. A bit over hyped as some animals, obviously, hard to see at night! The running commentary on the slow moving vehicles was reasonably informative. Would not say this is a must see attraction. Easy to get cabs back afterwards at the rank. Do not get in the premium ones like I did, they really do cost a lot more!"
,,"Interesting visit, long queues",3.0,,"We watched the Animals of the Night show. The presenter was excellent, although watching animals perform does feel a little uncomfortable in the 21st century. About three quarters of the way through, about a third of the audience left. We realised later this was to beat the queues for the night train.
The queue for the actual night safari was long (about 40 minutes).
The tour itself was excellent and really interesting. You feel really close to the animals.
Overall, a good tour, just marred by being marshalled from one queue to another."
,,Prepare for crowds - plan your visit!,4.0,,"First of all, some technical information. Get tickets for the 7.15 slot if you can. This means that you can enter the park anytime you want during the evening. The park is horribly crowed around that time. Show up a bit later, perhaps around 8 pm. Even if there is a lot of people even at that time, it's a bit better. And don't eat at the expensive restaurants on the area. Eat before you get there. Also, if you can visit during the week instead of the weekend - do so.

Now, the Night Safari itself. We took the 40 min tram ride, which I can recommend. You get very close to the animals. We also visited the ""Creatures of the night"" show, and both liked that the show was on the animals terms. If they didn't want to come out, they didn't have to. We especial liked the recycling sorting otter :) We took a taxi to get there, and a taxi back to the hotel. It was cheap (around 20 SD) and very convenient."
,,RIP OFF not worth it,1.0,,"Arriving at the allocated times 8.15 for which you can take a train & bus for next to nothing & its so easy and cheap...

BUT on arrival they dont tell you that the last show is at 9 so you automatically go on a tram come off to realise that the show is no longer available even though the park is open till 12 midnight. NO POINT

the Tram has a tapped recording as it rides around the park. the tape keeps skipping / jamming so you cant even hear it coherently. what a sham!

SO the only thing left to do is the walking trails by yourself.

For what I paid I could watch Plant Earth David Attenborough 10x over.

Organisers are just interested in making money its pretty obvious and there is no quality just short cuts - take a leaf out of Disney's and Universal's book!!"
,,Amazing Night,5.0,,The night at the zoo was just extraordinary. The Wildlife show was the best part. the Fire show also is well performed and pleasing to watch. The tram ride too is very good. The lions and elephants were the best. Amazing place for people of all ages.
,,Good trip,4.0,,We did the safari with meal and preferential access to the train. It is worth doing it this way as a very good meal and with thousands of people no queuing. The guides on both the coach getting there and back and on the safari were very informative. The zoo trip interesting and being at the lions when the male decided to roar was an added bonus
,,Very crowded and a bit of damp squib,3.0,,Place was sounding very exciting for my kid but found it to be extremely crowded and not as exciting as made out to be. Few animals are indeed never seen before but otherwise overrated.
,,Unique experience!,5.0,,LOVE the Night Zoo! Have been multiple times and each time I enjoy more than the last. If you're lucky you'll see tons of animals just hanging out and they are so close without you ever being in danger. It's amazing. Plus the park employees are renowned for taking excellent care of the animals so you feel like you are helping not hindering by learning about them.
,,Night safari was awesome,5.0,,It's kind of scary on the walking paths you feel close to the animals. The tram car ride takes you through the park. The lions tiger and elephant were the best
,,very nice place,5.0,,I think you should come with your family. have a good sleep first the restaurants are also good there. you see animals in there nature just without borders.\
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"What a disappointment.... Virtually the whole night queuing is standing and without seating. We'd pre-purchased from The hippo and duck tour people ahead of time and got out there to find the first two ""shows"" we were in time for sold out. They call them shows but they are actually queue groups for their trams. So If you are in an 20:15 ""show"" you get to stand in a queue at 19:05.... They open the barrier for your group at 20:15.... You go through with literally 100s of others. We then queued a further 45 mins to get to the next ticket barrier and 55 mins altogether to get on a tour tram. Which I think lasted 30-40 minutes. They will tell you are other 'attractions'...
*Restaurants - which we couldn't go into because we spent all our time queuing (dinner consisted of a bag of peanuts).
*Creatures of the night show - the first two when we arrived in that I area were sold out and we couldn't go into either anyhow because all our time was spent queuing.
*5 Short walks... You guessed it we didn't have time to do these with we couldn't go into because we spent because of the time queuing.
*There was a Borneo fire juggling group at the beginning but unless they had actually stood on a roof I couldn't have seen them from my place in the queue.

I am happy for them that they are so successful but this just isn't right - certainly not worth a 10th of the money we paid."
,,Good concept,4.0,,"Night Safari was an enjoyable experience, with different animals visible in a re-created habitat. The tram ride was slow paced with ample opportunities to see the animals & a good commentary"
,,Queuing for hours and hours,1.0,,Don't come here. I am serious. You have to queue up for an hour just to see the show and another hour to get on to the tram. Please save your time and money for other activities in Singapore. This place is TERRIBLE unless you enjoying queuing.
,,Hot and Busy!,4.0,,Amazing and well payed out. Plenty of shade. But oh was it busy!! Night Safari was the best as saw more of the animals and they were definitely more active.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"This was a unique experience getting to see animals during the night time. There's mainly a 40 min tram ride, animal shows and trails to explore. There's many trail walkways to explore (the park closes at midnight) so make sure you take a nap before you get there so you can enjoy and make use of the full experience, since tickets were kind of pricey."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"Great place to go with a family or by yourself. Well run, though very busy. Spent almost an hour queueing to get in for 8:15pm slot, may be worth going late as it quietens down. Very close to lots of animals, including tigers, lions, giraffes, etc. I can see why it is one of the best Singapore attractions."
,,Best Zoo in the world,5.0,,One of the best zoo in the world and night safari is awesome and not be missed during the visit.Best experience.
,,Night Safari Singapore,3.0,,"On the one hand this deserves a higher rating and on the other a lower. In terms of concept and what was available to see it ranks quite high. However, it was way overcrowded for 7:15 entry. By the time we got in, the show was full and we had to take a walking tour as the tramline was too long. We had to queue for the 8:30 show for 30 minutes to ensure we got in before the 8:15 crowd. Hugely disappointed at the crowds and management. Great to see the animals at night though albeit we saw many during the day at the main zoo! We ended up leaving much earlier than intended due to the crowds and a fair distance back into town. expect S$35 taxi. Maybe later sessions are quieter but bear in mind the time to get back to the city. Overall disappointing. however the main Zoo and River Safari were both excellent 5 and 4 star."
,,Too busy,2.0,,"The park is a good concept but unfortunately it was too busy to enjoy it when we visited on a Wednesday night. The queues for the tram were very long, and soon after we finished the tram ride it was time to head back to our hotel.

We took the MRT subway and bus there which was fine. On the way back, we booked a bus shuttle back but that was quite disorganised.

Maybe visit a less busy attraction."
,,Read this for fast and best experience,3.0,,"1. Try and get booking for the 7.15pm batch. Safari is even less enjoyable as the night falls..
2. Make time to attend the two performances- they are ok, not great...but well since you are there.
3. Skip the Trail, and just do the Tram ride - Trails involve a lot of walk (ok for me, may not suit everyone), plus the animals and the habitats you get to see in Tram ride are the best attractions.
4. In the trails since it's night you may not get to see all animals properly. If after the Tram you have time you may choose to walk the Trails at your own casual pace.

Overall I found the experience only average, the tickets are 45 SGD on the main website...just do a bit of research as you can get good rates on some other portals. I got this for 30SGD."
,,A good outing indeed,4.0,,"One could see the wilderness and wild in the hue of the night here.
Unfortunately, the day we visited, there was a technical snag which left us waiting for about half hour. There was also an instant when the tram engine made weird chughing sounds and vola... stopped in the middle of the wilderness with the hyenas grinning at you.!
This notwithstanding, the ride was good and memorable. Don't miss it if you are ready to devote an evening for this..
If you are short of time, please give it a skip..."
,,Enjoyed it thoroughly - can improve tram ride a little ?,4.0,,"For all visitors, they can pre-booked their tickets online to save time to purchase. Was there with a friend on a Monday night. I expected it to be less crowded but there are other tourists as well so there was a queue to attend the ""Creatures of the Night"" and ""tram ride"". It is July so the weather is a little warm but generally, all the sections were well organised. For the tram ride, I wished they didn't cramp 4 passengers in one row, they should gauge the size of the passengers and two of us had to squeeze with two big size people and it was very uncomfortable. I suggest for first timers to watch the ""creatures of the night"" show, take the tram ride and do at least one short trail walk. Its all worth it. Good site to visit if you come Singapore."
,,Long wait for the safari,4.0,,"We had a full on day and after waiting ages to get on the safari my youngest was too tired to go on a night walk.
The safari was however amazing, seeing the animals at night and the guide was informative.
There were fire breather/dancers at the entrance which we watched on our way out which the kids loved. Would have loved to stay longer but the kids were pooped.
If you don't mind travelling all the way over to just do the night safari so your kids arent tired then I would recommend that."
,,Terrible experience,1.0,,"We were very disappointed with our experience waited 2 hours to be admitted to park saw creatures of the night show ,very glib and predictable, not worth it went to catch the train to do safari only to discover no time to do as our return transport left at 11
BEWARE of timing as we couldn't get into earlier show as staff said we would have plenty of time to see it all"
,,Have a Bloody Mary and a curry before the night safari,4.0,,"A pleasant way to spend the evening. The feel is very different from the day zoo. The 7:15 pm and 8:15 pm sessions can have almost 2,000 visitors each, although efficient organisation makes the wait less painful. Have dinner and go for the later sessions if you can; it's much less chaotic. The food is pricey and not great, but what do you expect from amusement parks and zoos?"
,,Kinda fun but plan day carefully,3.0,,"Kind of a fun and different concept. First to say it is an entirely different park to the zoo and hence maybe too much to do the zoo and this in the same day if you want to do both justice.

This is a tram ride around the park (about 40mins) then you can walk it after to see some more animals (60+ mins). It is a bit of a chaotic start with everyone arriving at once so be prepared.

Also, as you might have guessed... it's dark so animals can be harder to spot and photos are all but impossible (even with a full frame slr). But still it is nice to see the animals in a different mode to the standard zoo arrangement."
,,Very good,4.0,,As a lover of animals the night safari was awesome! It gives you the opportunity to see wild animals in basically the jungle. I would highly recommend it. By the way GET THE TRAM IN THE SAFARI DONT WALK OR YOU WILL PASS OUT FROM THE HEAT!
,,Premium Night Safari,5.0,,The premium night safari was a fantastic experience. Our private guide Nur was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The extra money for the premium safari is definitely worth it!
,,Feel bad for the animals - tourists are too noisy,1.0,,"This is like a picnic spot... the animals are all there..but lazy and almost dead....they look drowsy and sleepy... you get to see them, because that when they are fed..
the place is super crowed but well managed as trams for night safari leave every 10 mins... each tram as atleast 50 people - very comfortable seating,however the tourists make so much noice.. use flash lights for pictures.. all this is not good for the animals.
.. over all very disappointed.."
,,Night Safari - Great Experience,5.0,,"Night Safari is touted as one of the unique experiences of Singapore.We definitely found it so. Whilst there is about 30 mins to 1 hr waiting time for the tram, it is worth the wait. There is also a show in an open amphitheater as a part of the night safari which is definitely worth attending.Overall a great experience with kids."
,,Too dark to see anything,2.0,,"We purchased the Parkhopper plus pass, to visit the zoo, Jurong Bird Park, go on a river cruise and the night safari. he night safari is much the same cruise s the river cruise taken during the day, but we hardly got a glimpse of any animals. Most disappointing, especially after the very long walk to the boats. I estimate it was over 1km from the entry gate, and of course, back the same distance. I would not recommend this to older folk."
,,Great night time activity but beware of crowd,4.0,,"We enjoyed this attraction a lot since it's happening at night when it's not too hot (no direct sun) and humid. With that said, the crowd was quite unbearable and we didn't get chance to get on the tram early so we walked half the park. I think we would have enjoyed the park better if we started off with the tram. The night was humid and hot. With young children it's a thought thing to do."
,,Night Out !,4.0,,This is another major attraction of Singapore. Different experience at the night with more darkness & the sounds of the jungle comes alive. Very crowded place but its damn cheap if we combine all 4 parks tickets we get around 50% discount.
,,Night Safari was better than expected,5.0,,Great experience. When we saw all the people waiting to line up we were glad we had paid for the tour and priority seats. We saw animals that we had not see before. Would recommend the tour.
,,Great place but very busy,4.0,,Lines for the tram quite long so be prepared to wait. It is worth it! There's something about being there at night which gives an entirely different experience to a day time zoo. Can't understand why other cities don't do the same?
,,Night Safari,5.0,,On recommendation I did the night safari during a business trip. Definitely the coolest experience I've had at a zoo. Big Cats are on the prowl. Recommend walking in addition to the tram to get a whole different perspective of the night time sounds of the jungle.
,,Night Safari is awesome,5.0,,"Great thing to do. Seeing the animals at night is a unique experience, and avoids the heat of the day."
,,A little boring,3.0,,Most animals not viewable or not active as they were sleeping. Unable to take photos due to eberything being dark and the no flash photo policy (for the comfort of the animals). Not sure id reccomend this to others. Average experience only
,,It is above good but not amazing,4.0,,We were in 1st batch of evening and it was managed well but need to be more.. wild animals few were just a walk away and few just a narrow lane away. Fire show was amazing out side of night safari.
,,Don't go!!! Crowded,1.0,,Too too too crowded. No fun at all for waiting more than 1 hour to get in a tram. The park should do some control especially in this high price
,,"Beautiful Park, Enjoyable Night BUT ....",4.0,,"This could be an excellent night out if planned carefully and if all available options are carefully researched. We’d purchased a 4-park hopper to save money and decided to specify the 7.15 timeslot for the tram. We knew from other reviews that the waiting time to board the tram could be around half an hour but were unprepared for the over one hour queuing time. By the time we boarded I had significant back ache which reduced enjoyment quite considerably. However, have to say that the entire park itself is brilliant, very cleverly planned and set up. The tram ride and commentary was excellent and we were able to see quite a few of the animals in the dim soft light. After the ride we walked all the trails and found the fruit bat enclosure especially fascinating (didn’t know they were so big). Decided not to queue up to watch the Creatures of the Night show as the first scheduled one was already full as we alighted from the tram. This is definitely worth doing provided you choose another way. Perhaps consider going through a tour agency or even doing one of the VIP options as that will guarantee you won’t have to queue."
,,Night Safari,2.0,,"Not really interesting.. Not worth the money. Will stick to the day zoo. Go on weekdays.. Weekends and Fridays.. Long que. You will take a very long time to get a taxi out of there.. Its s isolated place..

Go weekdays night only if u intend to get a taxi afterwards.

Avoid Friday Saturday Sunday"
,,Well worth it once,4.0,,"To do this right book it with a tour and then there is no waiting! We booked one with out the dinner. They pick you up, then take you to the bus with the rest of the tour - there are no private tours unless you book them directly with the night zoo - which you need to do at least a week in advance, but to be honest we don't feel we need it.

Not all of the animals were viewable this time and the commentary was a bit behind what we were seeing.

Don't do this the day you land as it is a late night! The walls are also really enjoyable, get in early for a pushchair for the young ones and go on all of them. We loved the bat enclosure the best!

We have done it twice now, so we may not do it again."
,,Well presented,4.0,,"Trip Advisor reviews are mixed on the night safari - and almost prevented us from participating. In the end, curiosity prevailed and our party (7 adults and a 3 year old child) were universally pleased to have made the effort (it's quite a way from the Central Business District).
We booked easily on line and were dropped outside the main entrance by taxi but public transport would have provided the same service.
The wait to get on a night safari tram was about 20 minutes for the 9.15pm experience (but would be longer, we could imagine, at peak times).
The show itself was remarkable. The animals are well presented: although lighting is dim (so as not to disturb them unduly). Most of the animals are clearly visible and their sighting accompanied by an informative live commentary. (The only exception was a stubborn hippopotamus who had decided to take a deep bath as our tram passed).
Especially impressive was the attempt by the zoo to create natural habitats (mostly jungly) for the animals on show. The night safari tram journey lasts about 45 minutes.
A couple of small points:
- food is mostly sold through stalls offering basic fare at sit down tables. We would have appreciated a somewhat more up-market facility as our party came together at different times from different areas of Singapore and would have preferred to wait in more salubrious surroundings. In the event, we assembled downtown
- Food is not allowed to be taken away, not even outside the zoo. This became a problem for one of our party who had missed the downtown assembly point and dashed to the zoo on an empty stomach.

,,Its amazing,4.0,,"My oversea friends family like this very much, it a must to buy the tram ride if with kids, do not miss the show, a visit to the bat cage, it will widen your eyes!"
,,Night safari,5.0,,We really enjoyed the night safari it was really interesting to see the animals in the dark . Be prepared to queue for a long time to get in but once you accept that it's a good night out .
,,A great evening out!,5.0,,"This was my first time visiting here with kids. My daughter who is scared of the mere mention of the word Lion or Tiger wanted to check out the nocturnal animals. The Night Safari do an amazing job and this tour starts off in a tram and brings you close to nature as you tour the park and listen to an audio guide explain each safari resident. It's impressive how discreetly the enclosures are built because it's easy to imagine the asiatic bear or hyenas simply climbing out of their enclosures. Some animals are free to roam and end up inches away as they lounge beside the tram route.

Off the tram is the highlight for me and you can spend hours here once you get off tram and take the extensive footpath routes through the safari. If you don't do the walk the tram tour will be over in 30 or so minutes and the trip wouldn't be worth it IMHO."
,,Brilliant night - if plan in advance,5.0,,"We had a superb time and felt we were alone i n the park a lot of the time. the staff were fantastic - friendly, knowledgeable and keen to talk.
We bought the express tram passes for 8.40pm but entered the park at 7.15pm .. .we thus walked alone on the paths while others queued for trams or took the tram ride. We then came back and did the tram with our own individual headphones (provided as part of the $10 express tram ticket) which was amazing .... so much to see and you hear nothing but the animals and the commentary. We ten completed the walking trails and could have gone to the 10.30pm show but were too tired after a great evening!
Without the express tram pass booked for a specific time I reckon this would have been an awful evening but with them it was awesome :) .....Best $10 per head we have ever spent!"
,,Pricey for simple drive around visit,3.0,,"Zoo is far from the center, takes more than one hour to reach by taxi. At night is difficult to see animals and no photos allowed. Animal show total waste of time."
,,Must Visit and memories to cherish for a lifetime.,5.0,,"I have recently moved to singapore for my further studies and chose the night safari as the first team outing along with my classmates.The place is accessible by the 927 bus from the Chau Cho Kaung MRT in the red (north -south )line.The ticket costs 45$ but they provide combo offers for 69$ which grants access to all the four parks:zoo.river safari,night safari and the bird park.If having NRIC or FIN another 15% discount is applicable.We had booked for the 8 15 pm show and had to wait for long till 9pm to board the tram ride.The ride is partly open to faciliate movement of air.The entire journey includes a guide explaining the nature of the habitat of different animals ,where they are found and a rough estimate of whether they are at the verge of extinction.Many rare animals such as Indian Rhinoceros,lion,tiger,otters,hyena,spotted leapord,flying squirrel,many dears .Must visits are the walking trails named after the animals.(wallaby trail,tiger trail).The place is great to enjoy.Camera enthusiasts should have night vision camera to capture a picture.Its pitch dark and I failed miserably to get one."
,,Nocturnal adventures of a different kind,4.0,,"If you secretly dreamed of growing up on a safari or like Mowgli of the Jungle Book, this comes close. Each time we visit, the attraction seems to go up one notch. This time, having the ophirs within hands reach as we rood the tram was simply breathtaking. A few tips - look for package deals and combos (zoo, bird park etc) to save valuable queuing time and cash. Also, get a map and decide beforehand which stations and shows you want to visit first. The birds of prey show is extremely popular so go early to save a good seat."
,,"Worth a visit, especially the night safari",5.0,,"It was great to get up close to the Great Panda and the Red Panda. We took the river cruise which was a pleasant short trio but only saw white rings. The night safari however was really great, very well done and you are so close to the animals. We went as an extended family so age range 65 - 23 and we all enjoyed it."
,,Night safari Tour a must,5.0,,My wife and I spent a very enjoyable evening on the night safari at the zoo. It is very well organized and very informative. It is a nice place to go in the evening to get out of the heat of the night.
,,Just OK,3.0,,"The night safari came highly recommended, but didn't live up to the hype.

The animal show is well done, but frankly not that interesting. The MC and animal trainers did a very nice job and kept things moving, but in the end I wasn't entertained. Neither was my father (78), but my daughter (13) did say it was nice.

TIP: if you go to the animal show sit near the aisle toward the top so that you can make a quick escape at the end and stay ahead of the crowd headed to the trams. We made a rookie mistake and sat low and in the center, which was great for viewing the show but left us at the end of a very long line when we left for the trams. The venue is small and you can enjoy the show just as well from the top as the bottom. I promise!

NOTE: It's hard to see the animals at night. This makes all the sense in the world, but didn't dawn on me until we were already $150 and 3 hours in the hole. It you really want to see the animals the day-time zoo experience may be your best bet. You can sorta see the animals from the tram, but not to my satisfaction. And if you're trying to take pics with something less than a professional camera (like your phone) you'll be disappointed.

All and all, it was just OK. I'd recommend going to the zoo instead."
,,A great evening out for a family,5.0,,"Even though it can be a late night, it was well worth the effort. The tram ride and the walk along the night trails later gave us a great opportunity to see the zoo on a balmy but pleasant evening. More animals were out and about than we saw during the day."
,,Night safari was well worth the trip,5.0,,This was a really enjoyable evening. After the tram ride we were able to walk a couple of the trails. It was a real treat to see a number of animals out at night.
,,A great experience,4.0,,"We have been to many zoos but our first night safari. Lots of animals to see in their own habitat and the Creatures of the Night show was great. Be there early if you want the 7.15 entrance, we got there at 6.15 and it was already fully booked and we had to go with the 8.15 entrance. Good food court that opens for dinner."
,,An experience worth visiting for,5.0,,"Didnt expect there would be so much rush at this place. But was amazed to visit animals from such a close distance.

Tram tour is informative and good. However for us, the real experience was travelling on foot and spending some time in the real jungle environment."
,,Wheelchair friendly,5.0,,Wheelchair friendly environment with considerate and well trained staff. Many THANKS to the Night Safari team for an excellent experience! :)
,,A great evening experience,5.0,,We went as a family and had an absolute ball. The guide with us was extremely informative and helped us to see things that we may well have missed. It is certainly worth a visit as it does differ from a normal zoo and seeing the animals during the day.
,,Great night out,5.0,,"We had prebooked online for what turned out to be a very wet night. Arrived in downpour and surprised to still see big crowds. Glad we had prebooked as early entry was sold out. Advise join the queues and do team first. Gives you a bit of an overview of park layout. Lines moved quickly. Better than expected and good commentary. As rain had stopped we then did all of the walks. Highly recommend these. Easy walking, excellent viewing and many of the tour bus groups don't bother so it's quite pleasant. Closest you will ever get to some of the gorgeous wild cats! We then finished with the final Creatures of the Night show near entrance - also a well run show. 30 mins in taxi back to hotel for only $20 easy way to go. A truly excellent family night out despite the weather."
,,Great and new experience,4.0,,"This was a first for us, we started with the tour around the park the walked around everything, highlights were seeing the fishing cats catching live fish from around the water in the enclosure, and seeing native bats flying around us and eating fruit that had been gun up to attract them in.

Not everything there was a nocturnal species which seemed a little odd, but most animals were active in the cool temp in the early eve as it tends to get dark just after 7pm.

I would recommend the iVenture card,"
,,Ruined my childhood memory of this place,1.0,,"I grew up visiting the zoo and night safari and had many great memories there but it has been some years since I last came and would never have known of the very bad changes that has happened to this place.

Firstly, you no longer have an option to buy a ticket without tram ride. There is only one option with the tram ride at an exorbitant rate of $45. Never fancied the tram rides as you end up wasting more time queuing and waiting for the trams to come and how are you going to see any animals if you are just going to whizz pass them on a tram especially since everywhere is so dark?! Isn't the whole idea of going to a zoo a leisurely experience of observing animals at your own pace?

Secondly, they have timed entries now so you can't just stroll in at your own pace after buying the tickets. We arrived at 6 and by then, the 715pm tickets were sold out and we had to settle for 815pm. Within the next few minutes, all the 815pm tickets were snapped up also leaving only 915 and 1015 tickets left. What do they expect people to do at the reception area for 3 hours? People also started to queue 1 hour before their entry time so everyone ended up being herded like cattle for about an hour. Not sure if this is a result of oversubscription of tour groups or the bad policy of every ticket a tram ticket and as a result an over capacity of trams and the need for such extreme crowd control.

Lastly, the entire area is plagued by the problem of poor signages. We couldn't find the toilet around the entire area and there was no indication at all that we were queuing at the wrong queue for tour tickets collection and we had to rejoin another queue again. What is the point of having bright and colorful tv screens displaying useless info. To add insult to the injury, the lady who sold us the tickets, Jenny, was especially rude and condescending towards us and even found the need to rebuke me as I was having a conversation with my husband about how I never remembered the ticket to be so expensive. Yes I appreciate the few dollars of local discount I am getting but for the great deterioration in experience since I last visited, I highly doubt I would ever step foot in this place ever again in my entire lifetime.

I get why tourists would want to visit this place for its novelty factor but there are much better ways to spend your night in the city with better value. Go see the beautiful night scene instead of the non-existent animals here."
,,Good experience,4.0,,I had a good experience with my friend at here. Entrance fee is little bit expensive but every price in Singapore is not cheap. Go with children will be really good
,,Different Experience at Night for the kids,4.0,,"Whilst the kids have been to many zoos and animal attractions, the Night Safari was different but still enjoyed by the family.

We watched the fire show on entry which was good then had to fight the crowds to rush into the Amphitheatre for the nocturnal animal show.

The tram ride was good however hard to see all the animals due to distance and some asleep.

We went to the 8:15pm entry session on a Weekday but it was still busy. If I was to go again, I would aim for the earlier entry 7:15pm and hopefully avoid the larger crowds. It would also give you more time to take a walk without making it a really late evening for the kids.

All up still an enjoyable experience."
,,Mesmerizing!!,5.0,,First visit to such a breath taking place. You can see the night life of the wild animals!! Really thrilling. A must do
,,Good experience,4.0,,"This was worth the experience, however I think I set my expectations extremely high after all the fab feedback. We stayed around the Quay area which took us about 45 minutes in a cab to get to the zoo as it was rush hour.

We booked our tickets online and managed to save a small amount and ensure we secured a place as we were told of its popularity.

To be honest the que was a nightmare, we were queuing for a while with a large amount of extremely excited children (should of packed some ear plugs).

Once at the front of the line we jumped onto a bus (golf buggy like) which took a large group of us on the night safari.

The actually tour was great but only lasted a short time. The animals were incredible and once approaching them the wait was worth it.

However I wouldn't recommend bringing your high tech cameras as flash photography is not allowed and due to the cart moving through out the tour it's extremely difficult to get a good night mode shot.

We had A lovely ice cream once we finished and had a walk around."
,,Not worth visiting,3.0,,The entrance is very expensive as you only get a tram ride where you see some animals in dark. No animals are clearly visible Try spending on jurong bird park as it is much better
,,Magical memorable must go,5.0,,"When you visit Singapore, you have to check out the award winning Night Safari. Upon entering the compound you will be greeted with tribal music and fire show. The tram service which I truly recommend as the primary way to enjoy the park will bring you close to all night creatures, such as Large Cats, lion, Bears ...so much more I couldn't named them. Some areas you will see are like the scene from Jurassic Park, where the gates will open and the team operator will inform everyone to turn off their camera flashes and lower their volume. Truly worth a trip, since it only open at the evening, it won't affect your shopping spree in the day!"
,,Impressive array of animals at close quarters,5.0,,"I really wondered how the animals are positioned so close to the tram, with no visible barriers and all seemed to be staring straight at us.
This is quite an exciting view of wonderful and exotic species of animals.
Perfect for the young and elderly who cannot walk. It is cool in the evening and you can pay 10 dollars extra for an express entry by the fast forward route. So no waiting in the long queue.
All of us really enjoyed it!"
,,Enchanting and different experience,5.0,,"Very different to visit a ""zoo"" in the night. You also see different types of animals, some of which are way more active at night.

Good variety of exhibits, more cooling to visit this place than the zoo which is limited to the day time. Also periodically brings in special exhibits.

One of my favourite attractions in Singapore."
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"If you like animals and observing them, then you should visit the night safari. There are animal shows and the safari area is large and well protected by you can see some less dangerous animals roaming freely, although it is not the open plains like Africa. The night safari do have also smaller animals and a cage for bats too."
,,Interesting night at the zoo,5.0,,"We decided to go to the Night Safari and travelled there on a bus owned by the prople who run the Duck tours outside Suntec City. Its a long way to the zoo and we were happy to enjoy the bus ride rather than do the mrt and another bus. Also the bus had clear return departure times and actually dropped us at our hotel rather than back at Suntec City which was fantastic. We caught the first bus at 6.00 but traffic was heavy so by the time we arrived the line for the tram was long and we missed the night creatures show. However the tram ride was great, with animals we had not seen before. Our favourite was the huge bull elephant who watched us and waved his trunk at us. When we got off the train we were starving and were spoilt for choice with fantastic food - we chose the rotisserie chicken which was really delicious. At the same ime we were entertained with a fire twirling show - impressive. Our friendly bus driver took us home by 11.00 and we considered it a great night ☺️"
,,Interesting experience at the Night Zoo,4.0,,"It was a great experience but there were so many people when we visited. Seems like they sell out quickly for the first 7pm entrance. Also, with so many people the shows fill up quickly as well."
,,Good for kids,4.0,,Must book with priority pass. Be ready to stand in long lines. Food is expensive. 45 minutes tram ride is good.
,,Amazing Animal Encounter,5.0,,This was probably our highlight of our recent trip to Singapore. Massive tip...don't line up for the tram and start walking. You will experience almost a solo nocturnal animal encounter which is very special. We caught the tram near Zebra Cafe as our youngest was a bit tired. The tram was crowded and noisy so the experience was not nearly as special. However it is truely a must attraction in Singapore.
,,A complete Ripoff for people from India - avoid at all cost,1.0,,"4 of us went for night safari. Very expensive as the ticket is 45 dollars plus getting there is a big exercise. Thousands of people, overcrowded and animals which we have seen before, all inside enclosures. I was expecting animals will be roaming free. Spent tons of money which can be much better spent in Sentosa or other attractions in Singapore. Big ripoff compared to everything else which is top class like Aquarium, botanical garden etc"
,,Most enjoyable,5.0,,"Second visit, still fascinating. Animals seem more awake later in the night so recommend to do the walks first, then the tram ride."
,,Incredibly crowded wholly disappointing,2.0,,Given all the hype about how good this is we decided to give it a go. Booked in for a 7.15pm slot so went early to eat at the venue beforehand. Food options seemed plentiful but turned out to be limited with many meals sold out. No air conditioning didn't help. We then joined the huge crowd who also had 7.15pm tickets. We were shocked at the number of people and the huge queue for the tram ride. The system they use to fill and move trams through is incredibly inefficient and made worse by the half filled express trams that passed at regular intervals (we only found out after queueing for a while that we could have bought express tickets for $10). We finally boarded a tram and eventually set off only to feel we were being rushed through the safari with little time to fully see or experience the animals. Really disappointing all in all.
,,Amazing night safari,5.0,,The night safari has got plenty of interesting animal exhibits and provides a closer view of nocturnal animals. The tram ride takes u around the exhibits and it is roughly around 40 mins. There are walking trails which will go through all the exhibits and will cover exhibits not seen on tram ride. The staff at the park are very friendly. There is an animal show which happens hourly. The last show on week days is at 9.30( so that you don't miss it like we did). It's definitely worth a visit.
,,Safari,3.0,,Not so worth the visit Too crowded Too dark to see any animals Anw an average experience Better go to the zoo
,,One of the top 10 sights,5.0,,Even if you don't like zoo's you should visit this place. Offers some great opportunities for photography
,,Book ahead,2.0,,"Had a nice, but short evening. Arrived at 7pm on Sunday night and all admissions were sold out until 9:15pm, so had to wait around out the front for 2 hrs eating over priced gelato. Tram ride was good once inside, but overall would not go back as it is 30 min cab ride from the city and then with a 2hr wait, which made the experience disappointing."
,,One of the things to do with kids,5.0,,"When visiting with children, this is a must do. Do not go tooate in the evening else you will miss the creatures show. Have your dinner in time before the safari tram ride as the restaurants there will close by 10:30 pm exact. Indian food also available at that restaurant."
,,The Best Night Safari Ever!,5.0,,"One might accuse me of being biased when it comes to the Singapore Night Safari. Even though I'm Singaporean, this is truly a magical destination, for adults and children alike... I've enjoyed my trips there (been there at least 5x), and it's always been an area of pride when I recommend it to friends from abroad.

The tram experience has always held an allure... it allows one to sit back and relax, while allowing the relaxing sounds of nature take over, as we adjust our eyes to dim, dark encounters with creatures of the wild (though, usually the docile kind, if you're on the tram ride!)... The guides are knowledgeable, and at times humorous (depending on your luck).

One's journey doesn't end with the tram ride - in fact, it's just the beginning! Walking about on foot allows you to explore deeper into the jungle like vicinity, and to keep company with the predators, like the lions and the tigers. When you venture deeper, you get to come up upon the giraffes, and the hyenas ... each of the animal enclosures are keep brilliantly separate, either by a ditch and stream, or clever fencing of territory using bushes, trees, hedges....

I always keep the animal shows for the last, as it is closer to the entrance/exit.. hence, a truly memorable finale to my experience at the Night Safari.

I've visited several Night Safaris in the region, but none as as well kept at the Singapore Night Safari. Some of the animals in the other night safaris are kept in appalling conditions, look malnutrition and they truly smell real bad.

Hence, this is the one place I'll always recommend to friends from abroad, if it's their first visit to Singapore... and then again, it has impressed so many of them, they just keep visiting whenever they come back. A true testament that it holds a special place in their hearts too!"
,,For children happiness only,3.0,,"Tt's A happy visit for children and a boring place for adults . It's a open zoo to drive in a toy train . If a all adults in the group , opt for any other place to visit ."
,,A masterpiece of planning,5.0,,"This Zoo is so well-organized that it provides an easy and seamless experience, night (the Night Safari) or day. It is so well organized that an incredible number of people are able to move through the space and see the animals in naturalistic habitats, ride or walk, eat at a variety of restaurants/snack bars within the zoo, and have a memorable adult or family experience."
,,Disappointed,1.0,,"Just visited the night safari. Bought tickets on line, queued to redeem them and queued for a long time to get through the turnstiles. After that we waited in a cattle run for 30 minutes and it hardly moved. A guide suggested we go for a walk and then came back after 9 pm when he said the queue would be gone. Returned at 9.20 and the queue was as long as when we left. It was obvious we would not get on the tram till well after 10 after arriving at 8 pm. We left very disappointed. If they cannot cope with the crowds limit the ticket sales. Save your money and watch a David Attenborough documentary on TV. It will be more enjoyable, less frustrating and a lot cheaper."
,,Ok..... day zoo was better,3.0,,"We did the night safari a few days after having done a trip to the Singapore Zoo during the day.

The idea of the night safari is great but the crowds for the trams are pretty long and whilst the tram ride is informative and relaxing it's obviously hit and miss with the animals given they have open pens.

As they are nocturnal animals the lighting doesn't assist for photos. It cost us around $25 to and $40 from the safari in a cab and there was no issues in getting a cab home at the time we were leaving ( circa 10pm)

It's worthwhile doing if you have a free night."
,,Need to plan ahead,3.0,,"We went to the Night Safari by MRT and bus, not realising how long a journey it would be. We got to the ticket counter at about 8.00 and were offered tickets for 9.15 entrance. After a quick discussion we realised that that this would be too late for us to see the place and get back on public transport, which finishes well before midnight. So we bought tickets for the earliest slot the next night and came back then.

The crowds were ridiculous, thousands of people. The fire show on the way in was good - wish we could have stood and watched it all the way through but you have to move with the queue. We passed on the tram ride, instead doing the whole park on foot. That suited us much better as it was way less crowded,we could go at our own pace and we could see more animals than you could from the tram. We saw some beautiful animals and the information boards were good too. I did wonder if the enclosures were big enough for some animals that would naturally have a big range. We caught the show on our way out at the end of the evening, and it was worth seeing. All in all it was expensive and a long trip out of the city, but a good evening out and healthier than a night out in the bars."
,,Dreadful,1.0,,"Well out the way of hotels and it's probably best to get a taxi direct to it,it takes 3 MRTs and a bus otherwise.the night we went was quite warm and humid,getting tickets was fine,but the queues,, big warm sticky queue,then when it's your slot,mines was 10-15pm, go through to queue for ticket machine then go through to join big queue again,wait till a big golf buggy train comes then in the dark go to see very dimly lit animals that you can hardy see and as you're not aloud flash photography,can hardy photograph,that's if they are not sleeping or behind rocks,and even when there is a tiger or elephant the guy stops for about 5 seconds,if you're VERY lucky you won't be behind a tree,the best bit was it is cooler in the trees than in the ticket area.it probably sounded a good idea,,Night Safari,but it's taxi and tickets money and 1/2 stone in weight.No"
,,Very overrated. Do not go. Read this once.,1.0,,"The place is not only overrated, but overpriced. If I had known earlier, I would much rather have gone to watch a movie. Which would have cost a fraction of what this cost was. Even a casual stroll at Marina Bay Sands would have been a better utilisation of time.

The shows, that were supposed to be good, were already full and hundreds of disappointed tourists were sent back without having seen it, inspire of paying the full ticket.

It is unnecessarily expensive, completely artificial, and has no real ""safari"". Flash is not allowed, so there is quite literally no way to take a decent photo. Do not bring a DSLR or any serious camera, it will be a waste.

There are a lot of sleeping animals and it legitimately just felt like I was just disturbing them. The guide is inaudible and was simply mumbling, since no one could really understand him on the tram or the supposed ""safari"" .

By singapore standards, quite pathetic and just a waste of time."
,,Night safari 2017,4.0,,We headed to the night safari after a day at the Singapore zoo and the river cruise not our best idea as we were all exhausted and the lines were massive I had booked our tickets online which was a great decision. Anyway the tram ride was brilliant the highlight of our day unfortunately we didn't do the trails as our 8 year old was well ready for bed if I return to Singapore I would definitely do this attraction again .
,,A different and my first experience of NIGHT safari,4.0,,"This safari is unique in a way that , this is conducted at night.
There are below things to do :
1) Show of night creatures : It is ok ok kind of show but show anchor was very good and entertaining.
2) Night safari in tram : It is an unique experience. This is around 30 minute tram journey/safari with audio guidance. I really loved it a lot. You can see lions, elephants , tiger, rhinos etc animals in this safari.
3) Walking trails : There are 4 walking trails to experience wild animals more closely . Good experience.
4) Fire show : It is happening near entrance and it is quite good.

Downside:
It is too far from city and no food option of vegans."
,,Long Slog for Not Much,3.0,,"We did the Night Safari tour on the evening of 5th July.

Everyone said we should do the Night Safari because it was an excellent tour. There was a lot of hype how great it was so we were expecting big things and left it until the last part of our holiday.

We started toward the Zoo from Bayfront MRT at about 5pm and caught the train to Ang Mo Kio. A short walk to the bus station across the road and we joined the queue for the 138 bus to the Zoo. We could also have gone from Choa Chu Kang and caught the 927 bus, but Ang Mo Kio was what we decided. Any map of the MRT or Singapore will provide these details and it is not a complicated journey. The bus ride took quite a long time and there were no signs or route maps to show where you are. A family was travelling on the bus and were concerned they had missed the stop because the trip was taking so long. But the driver stopped at the zoo and advised everyone this was the Night Safari.

We had seen signs all over Singapore advertising S$69 for 4 parks, one which was the Night Safari. We could have bought tickets to the Night Safari anywhere in Singapore, but we didn't just in case we ran out of time and did not get to go. We didn't want to do 4 parks, just the night safari, so the deal was no good for us. We decided to buy tickets on the night when we arrived.

When we got off the bus it was like peak hour. Busses and cars were everywhere and there seemed to be thousands of people milling around. We walked over the road and joined the throng of marching tourists past the trinket stores, cafes, and eating stalls, toward the tour ticket counters. It was 6:55pm by then and we saw that the 7:15pm tour was already sold out. The next tour was 8:15pm and I was concerned with the amount of people everywhere that the 8:15pm tour would sell out before we got to the ticket counter. If you had pre purchased tickets you could go straight to the giant queue waiting to go on the tour. If not, you had to stand in a line and wait to buy tickets. Our two tickets cost us just short of S$70.

We then joined the massive and noisy queue waiting for the Safari. So from 7:30pm when we bought our tickets, we stood in a long queue waiting to go on the safari. The staff were directing people to where they needed to stand and eventually, at around 8:10 we found ourselves in a rank along with groups of 2-4 people ready to board the bus. An open bus with 4 or 5 carriages would roll up, guests would embark, and the bus would roll off slowly to the tour.

At 8:35pm our bus arrived and the 4 or 5 carriages filled with people. The two of us were at the front of the bus and had a fantastic view out of the sides of the carriage. We could hear the guide well as he spoke quietly into a microphone. We were asked to be quiet, that didn't happen. We were asked not to use flash photography, and that didn't happen. You had to roll your eyes at the tourists that simply did not follow very clear and understandable directions. Before embarking on the bus we had stood in a queue for over an hour while recorded messages in multiple languages said to be quiet and no flash photography, yet there was a constant drone of babbling on the tour and people took flash pictures. But how can you control a mob of over 100 people per tour?

We rolled for 30-40 minutes through the zoo. The animals were in separate enclosures as we rolled past. The only animal able to roam was the deer. We had a small unhappy deer do a sort of mock charge at the carriage as we trundled past, and that was the highlight of the tour. As soon as it had started, the tour was over. I'd seen maybe a dozen select animals, listened to a practiced monologue of well worn classical hand tooled jokes from the guide, and seen a few shadows that were this or that animal. After all the hype about how fantastic it was, I came away extremely disappointed and concerned that the animals are subjected to this 7 days a week. It really was a 1 out of 5 tour. A S$5 tour of no substance and well overpriced. A major marketing coup and revenue raiser for the zoo that sadly did not match expectations.

Put simply, you cannot push through large groups of over 100 people every 10 minutes for 4 hours and expect to present a great tour. Add to that the 2 hours we spent travelling there and back to the hotel it was a very long night for very little. My personal advice would be to get to the zoo during the day and spend the whole day walking around looking at the animals.

Big thumbs down for the Singapore Zoo Night Safari."
,,A bit different,4.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this, when we arrived it was very busy and seemed poorly organised. Timed tickets are sold but these don't seem to actually tally up with the times they were admitting people. The tram tour was interesting and there was a lot to see, but I expected to see nocturnal animals who would naturally be awake at night, when what we actually saw was lots of animals that should possible be asleep but were being fed to keep them awake? We didn't make it to the shows as there was plenty to see besides these, and there were some rare animals such as pangolins that you could only see on foot that were worth checking out. I think it is an experience that could be made a lot better just by limiting the number of people admitted each night as the queuing was a bit excessive but it was definitely an experience and the animals seemed to be well cared for."
,,An evening with Nature,5.0,,"A journey into a different world. An amazing experience.There are 2 evening slots for entry.Plan the first slot if you depend on public transport,as the last bus leaves from the park around 10.30 -11.00 am.The park is around 40 mins journey by bus from bus terminus Ang Mo Kio.Note that the tickets for this attraction is valid for the date and time mentioned in the ticket.So need proper planning.A tram takes you around the park with a recorded commentary to help for every attraction along the way.If you are lucky you can see the animals resting very near the tram route.For those who cannot walk long distances can opt for tram.The best would be to get down in the stations and go around the nearest attractions."
,,very busy,4.0,,"I visited on a Friday night and was overwhelmed by how busy it was. I purchased the 8:15pm ticket and did not get on the tram until 9:30 due to the swarms of people in the line. Once on the tram it was fantastic however there was then little to no time afterwards to wonder the zoo on foot. Overall it was great seeing the array of animals, however I would advise going during an off-peak time to avoid the lines."
,,I enjoyed the day zoo more,3.0,,"If going, I recommend booking for earliest entry time (7.15pm) as you have best chance of getting a cab home if you depart before 11pm.
We arrived early and ate there and the food was tasty.
I recommend starting to line up for entry ahead of time as there are a lot of people per wave and the line up once you get inside for the tram ride can be loooong. They try to funnel people to the 'show' before the tram but, like with the day zoo, the show isn't great and I wish we had skipped it and got straight on to the tram.
Tram ride is fine, but I found myself getting irritated as the people we had to share our seat with (4 people per bench seat) and their family members behind us didn't shut up the whole ride so you couldn't hear the tour guide and despite being told not to use flash they, of course, chose to ignore that.
Not all animals are able to be seen unless you go on the tram so it's necessary to go on it and just luck of the draw if you get good seats/other passengers.
Rest of the walk was fine and but many of the animals are just sleeping so not particularly exciting.
I thought it was fine and but enjoyed the day zoo more."
,,Totally mismanaged,2.0,,"Park officials have no clue how to manage crowd. Never seen any show where they keep everyone in a holding area for 30 mins and then just open the gate and let everyone run for their life to get good seats.

Small park.. very large crowd. Not properly organized. Kids get tired waiting in long queues and loose their interest to see any animal... By the time we board the tram.. half the kids were fast asleep

Not worth the long wait. You end up spending in the restaurants inside the park and they loot you. One slice pizza is $s 14
Beer is $s11"
,,Awesome! Must do.,5.0,,"We had been to Singapore Zoo before and thought it was brilliant during the day time. But doing the Night Safari is even better for many reasons. Firstly, it's much cooler and no mosquitoes. Secondly, the animals are more active. We booked on line for first available time slot of 7:15pm (our kids are 6yo & 8 yo) so it wouldn't be too late a night. We caught a taxi early so we could eat there before hand. Suggest you go straight into the Creatures of the Night show first as the show is only every hour, so as more people come in later it is more difficult to get a seat. Being from Australia we decided to skip the Wallaby Trail, and walked through the Fishing Cat Trail and the Leopard Trail. You see a lot more walking these ones and the walk at night is really nice. We then caught the Tram from Station 3 as animals on East Lodge Trail are easier to see, plus you can't see Elephants, Rhinos, Wolf unless you go by tram. Whole thing was a really great experience. Easier to get a taxi to & from Clarke Quay than any other transport option. Only $30 each way. Only down side is that you MUST not use your flash on your camera in the park or it can harm the animals, so your photos end up pretty dark. But better for animals."
,,Fun at the Night Safari,5.0,,We went to the night safari after we had been to the botanic gardens and Singapore Zoo for the day. We were pretty exhausted. Don't miss the show as it is great. The safari is mostly animals you see at the zoo but at night time. Still worth the visit. There were thousands of people.
,,Visit with family not happy.,3.0,,"Ordered our ticket on line believing you can secure your spot. Got their early about 5.30 pm to find the 7.15pm tram booked out ( first in first served apparently). But you can't go in unless you get on the tram first. We paid an extra $10 to get in at 7.15. so we could at least start the walks. Then when we showed our tickets, no body knew what to do. We went on the tram at 7.15 and saw the animals which was great. We then went on the walks around the zoo which we really enjoyed as a lot of the animals were being fed at the same time. We then went to go and see the Creatures of the Night show, we were told it was full and first in first served and we could not go and there was no other show. So we were very disappointed with the lack of communication. I feel if they have that many people going through the gate they need to cater for that many to see the show. On a positive the landscaping and the animal enclosures are great."
,,good!!,3.0,,good but not much good like singapore zoo. its like same things watching in day in singapore zoo and night at night safari
,,Ratio of people to animals is just too high,2.0,,"The animals are unique and amazing but you feel like you are being processed through the night safari rather that ""doing a safari"" Everything works really well, there are just too many people for the number of animals you can see"
,,"Must do experience, have seen nothing like it elsewhere",5.0,,This is a great tour to do and starts with a show introducing a number of animals to the crowd. Following this there is a tour through the park on a hop on hop off vehicle where you get to see some of the night animals up real close. Its the closes I have ever been to lions which was a bit scary. A walk around some of the area is also good.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"We were go night Safari.its amazing experience.fill the zoo at night.awesome,we saw lion,tiger and many more with tiny difference.lifetime experience."
,,Too Many Humans,2.0,,"Unless your desire is to see rude, pushy, and unwashed masses of humanity, do NOT waste your time with this stop. There seem to be no limits on the number of visitors allowed in, thus you get what seemed like thousands of people who refuse to queue or follow simple instructions. I honestly feel for the poor animals who are subjected to the various flashes from cameras despite instructions not to do so. I wasted hours of my life I cannot get back. AVOID!!"
,,Long queue,2.0,,There's alot to do in singapore rather than this. We reached singapore in the afternoon . After having lunchbat around 8 pm we reached here. There were huge lines. We had to wait for an hour and a half. And it was nothing much impressive just a few animalsbabd thats it. Not worth going.
,,"Key tip: walk, don't ride",5.0,,"I was pretty horrified to see the long queues at the gate for the 7:15 p.m. time slot, but the vast majority of people opted to take the tram around the park instead of the walking trails, which we discovered to be nearly deserted and very quiet. As soon as my kids saw the mouse deer (the first exhibit on the Fishing Cat Trail) in the undergrowth, they were hooked. The novelty of seeing animals at night is obviously the reason for the Night Safari's longevity. It's just unusual and therefore fun. In some cases your view of an animal is not as good as at a conventional day zoo; in other cases, it is much better. And in some cases you can't see the animal in a particular cage at all, but that's also true at a day zoo. Everyone has their own opinion, but ours was that the walking trails offer the best way to see the zoo, being quieter and far less crowded than the tram and giving you the chance to spend as much or as little time at each exhibit as you want. True, the walking trails do not offer access to a few of the animals that can be viewed on the tram, but those are few in number. Much of the Fishing Cat and Leopard Trails, meanwhile, are only accessible via the trails."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A must visit.The enigma of this place leaves you in awe.We reached here in time from the zoo for we had planned to do it the same day which I realized was a mistake for both require full energy.
We qued up and luckily were the first ones for there was a massive line later on.
Remember the day of the night Safari and also the time .
The Safari began with the tram ride with an English commentary.
We could here the lion roar.It is a different experience.
The jungle trails are ultimate.
Don't miss the animal show it's awesome.
We finally had our dinner and headed back to the hotel as we were extremely tired."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"Truly awesome to see animals active at night. Habitats are well designed and seem to have animal welfare as priority rather than viewing for guests which is great to see in Asia. Tip; walk round rather than getting straight on the tram. You see so much more in terms of animal feeding times and interaction with the animals. Save the tram until last, plus it's quieter queues later in the evening. We opted for the 8.15pm entry and left at around 10.30-11pm. Fantastic experience."
,,A unique zoo-like experience!,5.0,,"This is a must visit attraction, especially if you have children. We took our nine year old son to the 9:15pm tram and he thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I recommend taking the tram, exiting at the first stop and walking through Leopard Trail, which should take 15-20 minutes. You can then get back on the tram to view the rest of the areas. The concept is quite smart....take people to see animals at night when they are actually active! We went on a Wednesday night, which apparently was much less crowded than Saturday nights. There are plenty of available taxis outside to get you back to the city center. You will definitely enjoy this attraction!"
,,Kids loved the night safari,5.0,,We went to the zoo during the day and we're not sure whether we should go for night safari also or not. But after visiting we will recommend it to everyone. Kids loved it even more than the visit to zoo.
,,Scary night .,4.0,,"Done the night safari one of the evening while in Singapore.
Booked it through our hotel. A bus picked us up from the hotel at about six and the journey took about 30 minutes or so. There is places to have food and drink at the zoo and gift shops also.
The night safari is very different to going to the normal zoo. In that you are on a tram which goes through the zoo and stops at each animal viewing area which seams only a few feet away and there are no bars or cages except for the one that houses the tiger. Very eerie and scary especially the Lions which adds to the experience. The whole journey takes about an hour.
I took a lot of photos but was not allowed to use the flash in case it startled the animals so have none that are any good because of the darkness.
There are two other shows available to see after the tram journey but you would be waiting a long time, as the place is very crowded. Seen the fire eating act while we were having some food, which is not bad.
Overall money well spent."
,,Great way to see animals,5.0,,"Loved going to the night safari - was a great way to see all of the animals via the tram ride. It was well paced and had a great guide. We also loved the walking trails which are a must do! We did it while it was raining and it was no problem!

We made the mistake of buying tickets for the 9:15pm slot thinking that this was the time you went on the tram and we could go in earlier to do the walking trails. However, this was the time you are allowed to enter the park. The staff were awesome and changed our ticket time and let us go in earlier!! The queue for the tram wasn't too long, probably waited around 20 minutes.

There was also a shuttle bus that picked up guests from the night safari and took them back into the city centre. Had to pay a fee but was a convenient way to get back to the hotel.

Definitely recommended!"
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"I have rarely seen these kinds of crowds -- the night safari is very popular but overrated. We came on a holiday so that may explain the crowds, but they had no way to manage all the people (which is easy enough for them since they set quotas for entry at certain times). Independently of that, the safari itself is mostly uninteresting. Our suggestion: go to the zoo or river safari; when you are done walk over to the entrance of the night safari and catch the show, which is prior to the entrance and put on for the people waiting for their time to enter. Then go do something else!"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Different type of zoo experience.
Wouldn't do it again as part of the local tours, but would do if I could make my own way there.
Organised tour is too rushed so you have to sacrifice parts of the experience as the bus won't wait for you."
,,I love the natural barriers!,5.0,,"As far a zoos go - Singapore has mastered it! The way they use natural barriers to separate animals from people is perfect. I love the rainforest feel - the lush landscaping & the lighting creates such a magical mood.
The fire dance show at the entrance of the night safari is spectacular - don't miss it - I think they perform every hour or half hour."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,Had a great time watching the show and the fire eaters ! We could not explore many trails but went to 2 which were a great experience. Recommend. Challenge however were the queues which were quite long.
,,Great place for family,3.0,,"If you are a couple, if you dont interest animal, you dont need to go. But if you have a child, strongly recommended👍🏻"
,,Well Managed,4.0,,Night Safari was again a good place to visit with kids. But you need to be prepared for ling queues.There were plenty of animals we saw which we were not able to see during our Singapore zoo visit. It was well guided. Only drawback was that the show after night safari got cancelled.
,,Great to see,4.0,,Wow... get there early for 7:15 tour. Huge line ups and was not school holidays here.great to see animals in the night as it is lit.must do the walks as well as ride as you don't see all the animals on show. All on hill walking.Some animals you don't see at all as not all areas of their enclosure are lit.kids enjoyed the experience. We did this after the day at the zoo so very big day 7am to arrive at 9am(bus transportation)and then finished at 10:30pm.
,,Nice,3.0,,"Interesting. Tram ride as well the footpaths are worth checking out. The food court is also good, so u can grab a bite as you come out."
,,Worth a visit but overcrowded,4.0,,"Compared to Singapore zoo, night safari was a bit of a disappointment. Crowd management is poor and the wait is too long at times. Weather didn't help either. Rain might be a spoilsport as everything shuts down. Tram ride is worth it but that's about the only thing of interest apart from the ""creatures of the night"" show. Book online and for the middle show to avoid standing in queue."
,,Loved it !i,5.0,,We decided to walk cuz of big queue for the trams.. loved the experience.. it was great.. the show that they put up was the highlight of the attraction!
,,Must Visit attraction.,5.0,,"The night safari is an awesome experience. Here they have a baby elephant named ""Neha"". :)
They also have a animals show, which I have heard is very interesting, however, I could not attend it due to heavy weather & hence they had to cancel it."
,,Good one time visit !!!,4.0,,"Night safari is part of all Indian tour operators so it's very crowded. Its a different experience but I think it's over rated . I find the zoo better as you can enjoy the animals much more closer.
7:15 timing is most crowded . You can choose that and go straight to the 7:30 show first . The show is OK hasn't changed much in a while .

You can then take a tram around the night safari to get a good view of all animals. All animals are same as you would have seen in zoo but the night ambience makes it different and interesting

.

Don't miss the fire show that happens at the entrance of night safari at 7 and then every hr.

For Indians there is an Indian restaurant at the entrance...bit pricey but if you Cant live without Indian food like me you can have your dinner before you go back ."
,,shame about the queues,3.0,,"Armed with memories of a wonderful first visit many years ago, we were not prepared for the long stand to visit. Firstly we bought tickets online, oops despite saying tickets they were not, they had to be exchanged for other tickets at 6.45pm. Waited in line, told that the tickets we had are only for 8.15 entry. Went for a seat. Came back huge queue for 8.15, go in at 8.45pm, then 30 min queue for tram to see animals. Lovely tour although quite quick and you really need to walk around afterwards, although after a hard days work and standing for hours we just headed home. Can understand why people will love this, I just come from a place that is less busy and this took the shine off. Stay clear of weekends and busy times."
,,Avoid!!,1.0,,Nothing special!! Just like a normal tram ride in a zoo!!There is nothing for the amount we have to pay!! Please avoid as there are many other options in Singapore.
,,Awesome Night Safari,4.0,,"Great opportunity to see wild animals behavior during the night. You will have the chance to see white lions, tapir, rhinos, bears, elefant and many other animals.
Skip the line for 10 Singapore Dollars and take the Fast tram.
The tour lasts for 40 to 45 minutes."
,,Overrated,3.0,,You really cannot see well in dark from that far plus there is only one animal pre type which makes it harder to spot. Really nothing extraordinary.
,,Wonderful time at night safari,5.0,,Award winning night safari is worthwhile visiting especially if you have kids with you. Quite a lot of animals are nocturnal and are active at night. There is a wonderful show with the animals and a safari train ride around the park. The area is nicely done up with plants so that the animals are seen to be within the jungle.
,,Definitely a place I'd like to visit again!!!,5.0,,"First of all, I haven't been to a zoo or safari at night, so this is my first time spending my night at the zoo. And I have to say, it's so exciting and memorable! As far as I know, there are two courses, one is taking the open air tram, which most people choose, and the other is walking around in the dark.

My friends and I took the tram, which took us around 40 minutes to finish the whole route. But I've got to say, it's a pretty worthy 40 minutes! We've got to see all those nocturnal animals and plus other animals that you usually see under the sunlight. It's an open area so you will actually be just a few meters away from those animals. Sometimes it could get a bit scary when the tram drove by tigers or lions but the rest of the time I was just enjoying my night there.

It's recommended to all those who are going there with no matter your family, friends, or lovers!"
,,Good,4.0,,Good place... But more scope of improvement is there. Well managed . Other than tram safari or Safari by walking very few are worth watching. Overall good for kids.
,,Great attraction,5.0,,I stayed there with my family and I really enjoy both the tram tour than walking inside the forest . Lot of animals and rumors give a fantastic atmosphere . I enjoyed even dinner in the restaurant inside the attraction . Must try
,,They were awake!,5.0,,"Why do i highly recommend the night safari? The animals are awake and moving around. It is wonderful to see the activity of Lions and many other animals.

The place is easy to get around, it is cooler at night and the people are friendly. Well worth the trip"
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"It was fun taking the tram ride and seeing the animals at night. Since the tram is a ways from the enclosures and it is night time, don't expect to get a real good view of them. Also there's no ability to stop and linger.

I definitely recommend booking a tour from your hotel so that you can get the priority line and not have to stand in long lines with those who just drive into the park. It will get you on the tram earlier and give you more time to look around. You can always take a cab back to your hotel if you desire to spend more time at the park.

The walks that they offer I found more enjoyable, since you could get pretty close to some of these nighttime creatures.

Be warned though that noisy children and adults sometimes scare away the very animals that we are trying to see."
,,Excellent but crowded,4.0,,"This was our second time there, this time being with kids. It remains exactly the same as it was 14 years ago. The show at amphitheatre was exactly the same! The animals are waiting to be seen at designated spots. Kids enjoyed the show and animals. There were huge queues for the tram ride as well as for the show. The authority should restrict the number of visitors to make the experience more pleasing. Right now around 2000 people are provided passes in designated one hour slots! A must visit with kids."
,,Great visit but expect big crowds,5.0,,"I've been to a few zoo's and this was the best I have experienced. The Singaporeans have done an amazing job with the zoo layout and variety of animals. There are different walking trails and a tram with guided instruction which takes you through parts of the park you can not access by walking. The only downside for us was the pushy individuals in the crowd who were extremely inconsiderate. Some people just have no manners and refuse to wait in line or just wish to rudely push past you in order to get where they want to go. Unfortunately, there were far too many of them. In the end though, we had a great experience and loved this zoo and the night safari experience."
,,Seriously consider not going,1.0,,"really disappointed. the line was so long, and then you only allowed one trip on the tram. because it was dark, you could not see anything. waste of money"
,,Try the night Safari at the Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"A trip to the night safari was recommended to us and it didn't fail to impress! Seeing some of the animals is a bit hit and miss, but you'd expect that wouldn't you!"
,,Rare experience,4.0,,"Night safari of Singapore is unique in that it takes the visitors in a slow moving tram, through a man-made forest inhabited by wild and a few rare animals from around the World, though mostly from Indian subcontinent."
,,This is a must do,5.0,,"I feel this is a must do attraction. this starts at 7:00 pm and there is a huge crowd at this time. i suggest taking the next time slot as this is right beside the Singapore Zoo and River Safari so generally people tend to do zoo, river safari and night safari together as this place is a little far from the city center. Both the zoo and river safari close at 6 PM. This is the main reason for a crowd at the 7 pm slot. take the next slot and you will enjoy more."
,,Good experience!,4.0,,"This place is mainly for children. Although its a different experience to watch animals on a tram in the night, the experience was much better for the children. Different animals from different parts of the world. Elephants and Lions are a treat to your eyes!

Worth watching once when in Singapore."
,,Do the river Safari or zoo,2.0,,"Not worth it. You see very few animals, you can't take pictures and you'll be in a que for a good 1-2 hours. We did a package deal to do the River and Night Safari and to be honest I wish I went to the zoo and did the river Safari. I'd rate the Safari 5 star but the Night Safari is very disappointing."
,,an average place to visit,3.0,,the arangemnts are good but lot of time taking process to complete the night safari tour. not a great place to visit.
,,Very disappointing,2.0,,"Only place in Singapore, where we were disappointed. It does not match upto the hype, not well organised as well. Being a week day, there was still a huge rush and people were made to wait for an hour outside and inside for the tram. After a long day, spent at River Safari and Singapore Zoo, people are tired and then it is only a tram ride and some animals which one would have seen in the zoo are shown from far. Definitely drop it, even if you have taken a Parkhopper ticket which is for all the 4 parks. The time spent here can be better spent in one of the great food courts under the malls (Raffles City mall, for eg)."
,,Extremely Poor Service.,2.0,,"The Night Safari itself is overall properly maintained.
But there are quite a few exhibit closure due to their upgrading works.

The Tram stations (especially the one at the entrance) has a super long queue and irritable, rude staff. We decided to skip the wait since it seemed like its going to be a long one...

While walking along the paths, some of the areas can be a tad dark and I have a young child who is afraid, my husband switch on the ""torchlight"" function on the phone and let her shine it on the pavement so to calm her down a bit.
However, after walking for less the 3 minutes, a guy (who later showed us his staff pass) happened to walk past us and very rudely say ""NO TORCH LIGHTS. NO LIGHTS!"" We explained saying that there is no animal exhibits around and that my child is scared of the dark, she is only shining it on the pavement and no where else. However, this guy just answered us in a pompous manner and showed his pass. Then again said - ""NO LIGHTS IN THE ZOO!"" While there were signs indicating no flash lights when taking photography, we did not spot any signs saying that we can shine lights on the floor/ pavements.

This episode kind spoil our outing since we have already seen the irritable staff behaviour (directed at some of the visitors trying to board the tram) at the zoo's entrance.

Then, after much walking, we decided to wait for the tram anyways at a random station stop near the Bear areas... Again, the staff manning this station was extremely rude. There were another small group of tourists who rushed forward when the tram was approaching... This Staff then shouted at the tourists asking them to queue up. Now, there is nothing wrong with the staff asking these people to queue up since everyone else is doing the same. Its the approach that leaves others wondering whether the Service Staff are all these rude?

We have encountered 3 different staff and all 3 seemed to behave as if they own the zoo, extremely rude and in a rather pompous manner.

The overall impression that we have of the Night Safari is such that the staff are not trained to speak properly and nicely to visitors. The only way they communicate is by shouting.

Definitely not going back anytime soon."
,,Family Visit,3.0,,"The night safari was very busy. After a long day of sightseeing in Singapore my family lost interest very quickly due to the long lines. There was fire show at the entrance while waiting to enter, then an animal show and finally the tour of the park (safari). The actual safari was interesting, but no different than a zoo during the day. The animals we saw were not more active. Although it is cooler at night. I would have like to tour the trails, but didn't have the time."
,,Good experience,4.0,,Night Safari was a good experience as we had lots of kids in our trip. The variety of animals weren't much but for a small outing in the evening this is a good experience.
,,Safari,5.0,,The night Safari was amazing going on the train takin you thru all the different environments it was amazing
,,Nice,5.0,,Long lines to ride the tram. But worth it. Then you can explore the park on foot after the tram ride; well lit pathways and fun to spot the animals. I thought the wallaby exhibit and fruit bat exhibit was great and not to miss...
,,Great attraction but the queues are long,4.0,,Best to book tickets online early. The 8.15 timeslot is crazy. Took us an hour to get onto the tram.
,,Great naturalplace,5.0,,"Good go , u see animals in natural habitat Good joy ride for kids a gives u a view of their environment"
,,Great night out,5.0,,"The zoo is open during the day but the night safari allows you to see the nocturnal animals in there natural environment.

We managed to see the lions feeding by accident as they only have scheduled feedings on certain nights. Be sure to check in advance.

Giraffes and hippos are definite highlights.

You can take a bus from town which cuts down the cost.

Been to Singapore twice, visited both times. Take a camera."
,,Safari,3.0,,An average Safari ride if you like animals more then it is good for those people so I prefer not to go
,,Must do,5.0,,A fabulous night. So many animals to see and so different at night. Beware it is crowded. Queues can be hours long for tram ride. Well worth doing on a tour as transport and priority boarding etc taken care of
,,Night Safari Tour,1.0,,It was a very hot and tiring tour.I cannot recommend this if your bringing a less than 1 year old baby with you.Also We encountered a very rude male employee from the elite pass area.He was practically yelling while giving instructions. Will not definitely go back to this place when I visit Singapore again.
,,Crowded!,3.0,,"The first time I visited this attraction was 25 years ago. Now many tourists have found this gem. Very crowded with tourists mainly from India. I paid extra to not wait in line for the tram. If you can stand the humidity, walking on the trails is recommended. I have to visit the fishing cats. They were very active the night I visited. It has become a big production attraction, like Disney."
,,Save your money!,1.0,,"We first visited in 2000, so with happy memories decided to return June 10th 2017. It was a complete shambles. Rude, ineffective staff. Hours and hours of queuing -they pack people in without the resources to manage them. I was shoved; and trodden on. The bull elephant was showing clear signs of distress. It was awful and nothing like our experience 17 years ago. Save your money!"
,,Average,3.0,,"1. Show at the starting was good. 2. I will not recommend anyone to vist Night Safari if you already visited ""Singapore Zoo"" . All the singapore zoo's animals they bring to Night Safari after 6 PM via different gate,"
,,Animals were great,3.0,,"This was overcrowded! I felt like a herd of animals. They only a certain amount of people each hour and the lines getting in and waiting for the tram are all very long and frustrating. The tram ride is kind of short. I hear it is better to walk the trails but after spending so much time doing the other things, we just didn't have time. The concept was really cool and I did enjoy seeing the animals. However, the execution was a little lacking."
,,Go with the intention of walking,5.0,,"I brought my little girl to Night Safari and had a fantastic time! We can't believe that we sighted 90 percent of the animals there. With a little homework I think it will help make the time more enjoyable.

1. Check the websites for discounts. There are slightly more discounts for tourist. Found this provider called govoyagin, their prices are better for tourists. For locals, on different days, there are discounts extended provided an NRIC number is being keyed in. So we picked a day where we get the maximum discount. For an adult and a kid, we paid $63.75.

2. Check the weather, I think if it were to rain, the walking bit will definitely be affected. Bring along a little fan and water, it will definitely make things a little more pleasant and save some money.

3. Be ready to walk. The 4 trails have signages all neatly and clearly marked out. It was not as long as we thought it will be. And all the animals on the map are at their right places. As compared to several years ago, Night Safari has definitely improved in terms of its walking trails, the recorded commentary in the tram and crowd management. The sighting of the animals became a little game for us, we stood still and waited for the animals to move. It was fun and the animals were amazingly beautiful.

I think some of the unpleasant comments made were targeted at some poor tourist behaviors and ill preparedness rather than the service provider. Yes queues were long but if the staff have tried to manage as best as they could and people are still pushing and shoving about, some tourists were even seen removing barricades by themselves, then it's the tourists issue in my opinion.

We went there at about 6 pm rather than 7:15 pm, the stipulated opening hour, after reading other tourists' inputs. We got to shop around a little, and get the map. Went for the animal show first, which we queue for about 20 mins. They tried to fill as many people in the area as possible, so it's not difficult to get a seat. After the show, we walked all the 4 trails by around 9 pm. Came back to the start point and hopped on to a tram, which by then was cleared of the long queues. The tram ride of about 40 mins was pleasant and we got to see animals which are not on the same route as the walking trails. The commentary on the tram was clear and informative, a great improvement from the first time I came. Price wise, it is a tad expensive as compared to some other zoos in the region, however the quality of the visit is one of my most enjoyable."
,,It was even better than I expected!!!,5.0,,"This is the first time I have ever done the night safari and I am not sure why I have not done it before. What a wonderful experience and well worth the price. It was a simple process of booking and paying for the tickets over the internet - no issues at all. The only disappointment is the other rude, push and shove visitors who wanted to push in front of you. No such thing as personal space. My only suggestion would be that the entry system into the actual safari is streamlined. Having to line up on mass and then go through the turn styles was a very cumbersome process which should be reviewed and streamlined. As there was so many people at the 7.15pm time slot I could not be bothered in lining up again to get on to the tram ride so instead headed left and started on the walks and what a fantastic decision that turned out to be. We had the whole park to ourselves for most of the night as everyone was on the tram. We managed to hop on the tram at the giraffe enclosure. The tram ride is well worth going on. I didn't get to see the live shows as I could not be bothered lining up and pushing and shoving with everyone else. One other thing was other stupid visitors that were using their phones as torches and shining them on the animals in the enclosures - they are nocturnal people and light hurts their eyes! Maybe there needs to be signs around to say no torches are to be used. The park staff were amazingly helpful and friendly. I had a wonderful time and will return again soon."
,,Animals,5.0,,If you love animals and wanna have an experience some what like a night safari then this is your place .It is very much suitable for family crowd it involves a lot of fun and memorable time to Be spent
,,Average Experience,2.0,,Replica of zoo just that it is at night. The only good thing was the show. Don't miss it if you are visiting. If its a rainy day its better to avoid Safari because you will end up with the tram ride only.
,,Too hyped for what you get,3.0,,"This was my second time visiting the Night Safari, first time 10 years ago. I hoped that things would change but after seeing the show it wasn't so special as I hoped it to be. It was very similar like the one I saw 10 years ago.
Girlfriend and I went on a day where there were a several huge groups of tourist, so it was really crowded during the show and don't even get me started on waiting for the tram around the Safari.
Due to a lot of people waiting for the tram, we decided to walk the path and I must say if you aren't tried and are able to walk then do so by all means. You get to see so much more Animal than being on the tram which only takes you on a set path which shows like around 5 exhibits when there are 30 to see *Number not accurate*.
Walking the path took around an hour but it was worth it.
For the price you pay and what you get from it, I wouldn't go again any time soon.
The Animal show is around 30 min, it is cool to watch it again.
MUST BRING - Mosquito/bug repellent
Since you can't use camera flash on the different exhibits, it is really hard to take any photo with your phone and even with my camera. Sometimes you can't even see where the Animal is hiding :P
Due to the night surcharge which was around 6 SDG more, so in the end it cost me 27 SDG from the Night Safari to get back to my hotel (Marina Mandarin Singapore)"
,,night trip,5.0,,not to miss this...very nice experience...overall one have to go at night for 2 -3 hours ..animal safari and other excurtions....
,,Disappointed,1.0,,"Waste of time and money. Family of 4 adults, almost $200+food+transport =$300+ Poor live show, animals are few and far between."
,,Entertaining relatives,3.0,,"I brought my cousin visiting Singapore to one of our highlights, namely the night safari. It was the post holiday period and I was surprised to find so many tourists there. The queue to the trams and night performance was packed.
The night show was packed to the brim and at my seated position on the side I could not see the animal activity down at the stage.
The animals underperformed also probably due to the large crowd or tired from entertaining in too many shows.
However the tram ride through the zoo was good and the commentary was excellent."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"A fantastic experience. Tickets are limited for each session - 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm. Would recommend getting there early to buy tickets. Fire show when queuing was fantastic. The walking trails were well signposted. Trams were good, although they didn't spend long near each animal."
,,A Good Experience,4.0,,"Not many many animals like the zoo
But the species that are visible by the tram mostly rare and endangered
The walks are 1-1:30 hours , the tram 40mins
If you want to watch the show inside try and get the earliest entry & express pass not required
If you want to avoid the show use express to go fast and avoid lines , though without that also things go well , a matter of saving 1hr to 40m"
,,Can b avoided,3.0,,Didn't find it interesting at all... It can be avoided... The animals v see in the day are more than enough... Nothing special in night safari..
,,Use the footpaths,5.0,,"Make sure to explore the foot paths, the tram is nice but it misses most of the animals. Everyone I've met who thought the place was less than superb didn't explore the footpaths.

Overall, the Night Safari is much better than a typical zoo. It has an immersive jungle atmosphere, the animals are more active at night, and you're at times very close to the animals. If you like animals, don't miss this place."
,,"Way way way too overcrowded. Very poor ""entry"" logistics. Very disappointed.",1.0,,"I have visited the Night Safari a few times over the years and although I very much wished to rate it 5* (as anticipated) I regret the destination deserves no more than 1*, rated so low due entirely to extremely high crowding of the whole facility, and very poor line logistics to enter the night zoo. I also have safety concerns of the facility due to the above reasons (covered at the end).

We arrived at about 7pm, with pre-purchased tickets, to realize that we had to join the long line to exchange our pre-bought tickets for other tickets. I purchased the tickets off-site to avoid the initial sales lines, and the ticket redemption line was 4x as long as the ticket line. Ironically, there was even a sign at the counter saying ""skip the lines, buy ahead"".

Next, we wanted to enter at about 7pm only to find that the attraction is SO OVERCROWDED that they now have 4 entry points per night, and 7:15pm was full, so we then had to wait to 8:15pm. Ok, it happens, but on top of that, it took more than 30-40 minutes for the 8:15pm entry ticket line to clear so 815 wasn't 815 but closer to 9 actually.

It started to sprinkle with light rain, so the young staff closed two of the ~5 lines to get in, pushing us under a roof to avoid the lane. What really infuriated me was that these 2 lines were merged into one ""holding line"" where we basically had to wait for absolutely everyone else in lines 1-3 to clear - and - the lines 1-3 continued to fill behind us so we were just waiting and people who joined the line long after us were let through first.

The very junior (ie young) staff were totally unable to manage the crowds- not their fault as they are young, but the systems / processes in place totally let us (the customers) down, as the staff. Not a supervisor was visible all night.
Allowing crowd control systems like this to continue in what must be a known problem is completely the responsibility of the management of the attraction, and they should be held accountable to fix it. Off to the right of our line, other staff were letting other guests through a side gate which further caused equity issues. I get it that it is hand to manage people and crowds, but, these are 100% predictable and have to happen almost every night. This is totally unacceptable, Night Safari Management.

I had also purchased the tram tickets, but on entry, found out that the line to just get on the tram was more than 45 minutes long.

The park was so crowded, with small/narrow trails that even when in the park, it crawled at a snails pace. It was like one long line through most of the park, with 30% of people moving backwards on the trails which further added to frustration of the night.

The food, drinks on site are very overpriced as well.

I love attractions in Singapore. I've been to many (I have lived here for 20 years) but something has to be done for this destination to make it appealing. We had a horrible experience due to the crowds / systems in place. The animals were nice, but unfortunately this could not overcome the frustrations of overcrowding.

In my opinion, the overcrowding situation as witnessed at 7-8-9pm+ last night puts the destination at risk and management in negligence should there be an emergency and crowds need to be evacuated. This destination was unsafe due to the crowds and systems / crowds need to be immediately looked at if even from this perspective, if assuming participant satisfaction isn't a factor.

I would recommend going to the zoo or bird park instead. Also busy, but much more enjoyable and better managed."
,,Wild Life at Night times!,4.0,,"Ever wondered how it feels like when you get left behind after a zoo closed!? My kinfolks and I went to this amazing place one night after a long busy day. It is themed like a real wild life forest with tremendous trees and lots of animals! They have arranged a tour bus but I recommend you guys walk throughout the place to get the senses of being in the woods at night. Although we did not observe some animals, the real fun and excitement was searching for the animals by yourself!"
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"If you are those who like to queue for about an hour for a 40 min tram ride to see animals, this is the place to be. I went because of my niece who had never been and the whole world is there. What a crowd!
Tip #1: If you are a tourist, consider joining a tour group to the Night Safari as you will not need to queue with the rest of the world for the tram ride. Quite worth it as it includes the ticket and the transport to/fro the hotel. Imagine having to wait with the same crowd for public transport to get out of the remote place.
Tip #2:If joining a tour group is a no-no, then you can consider doing a walking trial first and then hop on the tram ride at the Leopard Trail, not much of a queue there as most visitors refused to walk at Night Safari and I don't know why.
Tip #3: The ticket entry time does not mean you must enter by 7.15 or 8.15pm. So one still going after that entry time and still get to enter. Again, I don't know why but the whole world turned up at the exact entry time for each time slot. They will still let you know at 7.30, 7.45, 8.30, 8.39, 8.41pm.
Tip #4: about the show, which is always full every night, it is best to leave it to the end of everything or send someone ahead to queue. By the way, once entered, there's no time limit when one must leave. Can stay till the zoo closes.
Tip#5: It is advisable to buy the ticket online as the 7.15 and 8.15 are often sold out.

Paying extra $10/person for the priority quene for the tram ride is not nearly as worth it in my opinion as still have to queue.

*Note there's no refund of tickets, so if it hits a rainy day and most animals will be hiding from the rain, it will be a brisk walk/ride at the forestry night safari."
,,"Over rated, over advertised, thoroughly disappointing.",1.0,,"Of all the attractions in Singapore, the Night Safari was mentioned by many folk, and advertised all over the city as THE thing to do whilst in Singapore. It is completely over hyped and over rated. The transport from the centre of the city to the venue is slick. Arriving at the centre, with pre booked tickets and with a specific departure time, we were told the departure time was full and we would have to wait to the next one (over an hour later) but when I kicked off that these were my tickets and constituted a contract, and that they would be in breach of contract, they suddenly found us 2 places. We were then herded along a zig zag line for over 45 minutes. If it had not been for a super couple from Vietnam who engaged us in conversation, it would have seemed much longer. The electric truck pulling seated trailers pulled up and we were told no flash photography as it spooks the animals (fair enough) but it is so dark that no camera I know of would work in such conditions. The commentary is mundane, and I have no desire to see deer and antelope I can see anytime. The virtual moonlight is ok if you happen to be an owl, but I hardly saw a thing. The tour took just over 30 minutes. I timed it. I had been herded longer in the queue at the beginning. When the truck stopped and we were instructed to leave our seats, I said in a loud voice: ""Is that it?"" It was a complete con. Very, very poor. I cannot state how disappointing it was. A complete waste of an evening. There was a satisfaction form which we took time to complete. We were shown a box to post it in. I suspect that there was a black bin liner underneath, so I handed it to a worker on the Information Desk, and told her to read it and put it in the ""Suggestion Box"" herself, as I do not believe anyone would care what I wrote. The staff were arrogant and unfriendly. It was the worst and the most disappointing thing I did in 4 months of travel around the world."
,,Very crowded,2.0,,This place is always very crowded and safari is not the right word for it. It is like going through a zoo in a toy train with animals that you find in any local zoo.
,,So-so experience,3.0,,"The ride is safe and good ,we at least enjoyed it it's just sometimes I mean rarely you see the animals nearby to you because they are sleeping , or far from you. You can take a walk to have some close view of them but if you have a kid on your side it is quite not a good idea because it is tiring. Overall it is a good and fresh experience to see the zoo at night time.
Take some look on my pictures, I think I have few good shots"
,,Different,4.0,,We went here with a family of 9 including 3 small children. We booked through our hotel which allowed us to jump the queue to get on the tram'. I'm not sure if I really enjoyed it. It was difficult to see the animals at times. We went on some of the walking trails and you got a bit closer view. If you leave the tram until later in the evening you can get straight on without waiting. We went here to avoid the heat through the day but definitely prefer the day zoo to this one. It is more expensive than the day zoo but not worth the extra money.
,,This a top-notch zoo.,5.0,,"Even though it was raining a lot , I've enjoyed going around here. Excellent collection of wild animals. Same place for night Safari but visibility of animal is not that great but gives a different experience."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"We spent from 1pm-12am in this area as we did river Safari, zoo and night Safari all in one day!

The zoo is just immaculate with so many things to see ! Only thing they didn't have that I was hoping for was a gorilla enclosure!

The major highlight for me were the white tigers! The whole enclosure was immaculate and they were so active swimming around and playing."
,,Disappointing,1.0,,After all the hype I had pretty high expectations. It was extremely disorganized and poorly executed. It's basically a zoo in the dark with some animals awake. The creature show was lame and we left before it was over. Maybe kids like it But it was too much talking not enough animals. We didn't get a tram ride because it was a gong show. The trails were dark and confusing and kinda scary. We had better views of the animals on the trails but we couldn't wait to be done and leave. Overall would not recommend until they do a better job.
,,something different in jungle,5.0,,"enjoyed a lot , one can experience wildlife next to his her eye . trams available so you don't have to walk much"
,,Packed,3.0,,"We were there on a Friday evening, it was packed with visitors. We waited two hours for our turn to get in, and watched two hourly performances of fire dance."
,,Amazing Tram Rides,5.0,,"I loved the Night Safari in Singapore. I liked the peaceful tram rides with audio guides telling me interesting informative about the animals. It's interesting to note how in different cultures, zebras are believed to have originated as black, then developed white stripes, or vice versa. And that wolves howl in harmony as a sign of camaraderie. However, as there are many things to see, I highly recommend booking earlier time slots like at 7.15pm to not risk missing out anything. Oh, and, definitely visit the enclosed spaces. You'd get to experience animals like bats in close range. This visit was one with my best friend. Very thankful that I got tickets online first because I got it for about SGD~30 whereas my friend got it for 45. Would like to recommend klook for all visitors. Sharing is caring.
Do visit night safari when you've got the time. It's a great chill place."
,,Rare opportunity to see wild animals in their natural setting,5.0,,"There are not many opportunities like this in the world! Ride through their natural habitat. We took the ""Skip the line tour"" which is listed on the Trip Advisor website. It was well worth the few extra dollars so we didn't have to wait in line for 45 minutes."
,,A bummer compared to the hype!,3.0,,"After waiting for more than an hour to get the tram, the sighting of animals on either side of the trail in dim light was nothing what I expected from all the hype of the Singapore night safari.
Being an Indian visiting Singapore and seeing more than 90% of the animals from India was low point for me.
Since I had already visited the Singapore Zoo, the night safari had nothing much to offer."
,,Great trip,4.0,,Great trip to do something different. We managed to see the night time show which was good and funny. The tram ride itself is good but we struggled to see a fair few animals as it was dark (I understand why etc but having done a night safari in Sri Lanka I was expecting visibility to be a little better) overall great trip!
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"Been on this safari twice. Both the times, felt that its not worth the money. Instead I prefer Singapore Zoo in day time."
,,A fantastic visit,5.0,,We went with my elderly mum and teenaged daughter. It was a Monday night but the crowd - my goodness! There were many entry hours - all quickly filled up. Supposed to have a tribal show but the crowd made it very difficult to enjoy the show. But the tram ride into the cool jungle is great! They have many animals - their habitat highlighted with strategic light so that we may gave easy viewing. And it is really a safari - some of the animals are really close to the tram. There is no enclosure! However the ferocious ones are kept far at a distance. You may also choose to walk to view more animals and continue back your ride in the tram. It is definitely a must visit in Singapore.
,,Fun place,5.0,,It's a great place for family. Very enjoyable and different. The fire dance is excellent! Must go place!
,,night safari in singapore,4.0,,"it was a wonderful experience to have the animals very near to us. the human and animal how they interact each others, this safari is the best example to know about it. superb. worth of money and time."
,,Chaos - left a disappointing finish to a great day,3.0,,"Entry into the park was madness. Long queues into the park and then an shuffled directly into a queue for a tram that we waited 45 minutes for. Animals cannot be controlled and they were often not visible or they place animals on both sides of the tram so that you can only look for one of them - in the dark.

We booked a show time for their hourly show but could not get in to it as the show was 'full'. We could have then waited for a further hour for the next show but after being at the main zoo at 8:30am for the Breakfast with Orangutans, our ticket was only used for a road tram in the dark.

We worked out that we queued for double the time that we spent on attractions and we posed for more park photographers than attractions too.

One last point, not meant towards the park or in anyway inappropriately. ..There are a lot of international visitors from neighboring countries that were drawn to the blonde hair and blue eyes of my Caucasian children. We never ever felt threatened but my kids grew tired of the attention they were getting to pose with them for pictures. It was too frequent in this park as everyone was bored waiting around for the insane queues. After the long day, it was too much."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"Has many food booths, you can get a locker for storing your personal items for SD3, and it's a very children friendly place.
The problem with the concept of a night safari is that it's very dark, so you can't really see the animals. The most you see is their silhouette. Also, the information plaques are often placed far from the animals being visited."
,,Better than expected,5.0,,"We had spent the whole day at the day zoo and had pre purchased our night safari tickets. We began to get a little concerned that the night safari was just going to be the same zoo only at night time. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find that even though the entrance to the Night Safari was very close to the zoo it was a whole different place with many different animals. My only complaint is that the queues for the tram were so long. We decided to start with the walking trail to avoid the queues and that was amazing (and quiet as everyone else seemed to only want the tram). We saw plenty and although tired from a whole day at the zoo there was so much to see that we got a boost of energy. We decided we wouldn't bother with the tram but then realized that there is a whole section that can be accessed by the tram only. Once we had completed the walking trails and had been to the show we returned to the tram queue only to find it was just as bad as it had been at the beginning. At that point we were too tired to join the queue and decided to just give it a miss which was a little disappointing."
,,Quite okayish!,3.0,,"We reached the Night Safari around 18:00 hrs to witness massive crowds! We first saw the Thumbuakar show followed by the Creatures of the Night show, both of which were nothing extraordinary to rave about.. We had to wait for almost an hour to get into the tram for a guided night tour, but once in, we could see quite many amazing animals in their natural habitats on a 30 mins tour. My 3 year old son was, in particular, pretty excited... There is a food court as well in the premises...The waiting time for the tram in the sultry weather, however, drains you out...An okay experience on the whole..."
,,Children will love it,4.0,,Great experience for kids. Sitting in the tram and watching the animals in the Zoo.Try the walking trail for watching the animals.
,,Not a 'must do',3.0,,"The concept is intriguing but the crowds attracted are funnelled into one attraction, the tram, on entrance. We queued for an hr and a half to basically get in!
When you need to leave at 2230 to get the last MRT it doesn't leave you much time.
The creature show is cancelled during wet weather- it rains a lot in the evening in Singapore... on a week night that is the only other attraction.

Recommendations- arrive early, before your time slot. We arrived at our time slot and still queued.
Later looked clearer, perhaps do the tram last rather than first.
The trails are worth the walk and fairly quiet. Bring wet weather gear!

For the price and the trouble to get there (MRT and bus which only took around 50mins) and the queuing involved once there I can't recommend the experience. Thought the tram ride did display some amazing animals even just after heavy rain so not a complete waste."
,,Okay types,4.0,,Over hyped. They have fixed entry slots of 7.15 8.15 9.15 and 10.15 pm best to take the 8.15 one. The tram riDe is of 30 mins and there is a huge que. Although there are any trams back to back but average wait time is 20 mins. U can buy express tram pass from the ticket counter for 10 SGD. If u are flying with singapore airlines then U get 10% discount on tickets if bought at the counter. The creature of the nights show was for around 30 mins. Over all nothing great.
,,Bit of a shambles really,3.0,,"Was supposed to get picked up at the neighbouring hotel at 6pm which was 2 minutes from our one then got a call at 5.50 hassling us to get down the stairs or the bus would go without us.

They were under pressure as the traffic was bad and it had been raining so felt like we were in a race.

Arrived and got pushed through the restaurant then rushed through dinner rushed into an animal show then crushed into a lorry taking us round the park. No time to do the animal trails before back on the bus back to the hotel.

All very rushed and not enjoyable .

Wouldn't go back"
,,Good idea,4.0,,"way from the heat of the day this should be a good idea but its super crowded, hot and with next to no animals to see. You are bundled round on a 'train' where spotlights try to pick out some of the animals etc. Best bit was the arena show."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,My husband & I went to this one night. A lot of kids were there but it wasn't I've crowded. The night bit made it more fun and it was cool seeing everything in the dark!
,,Very Unlike Singapore - poor organization,1.0,,"Night safari on May 26th

We had 7:15 tickets and were in line - it took over 1 1/4 hours before we boarded a tram because trams only came every 20 minutes or so to our tram station.Even then we only got to board a tram at a different station by complaining. Full trams from other stations (tour groups and those who paid more) rolled by our station so we could not board and the empty trams ended up at the station across from us. The final insult was when they moved people at the back of the long line ot the station across from us - which was totally unfair and disorganized. There were 4 adults and 2 kids in our group - overall the wait totally soured the expereince"
,,Pathetic way to showcase animals,1.0,,"I visited the night safari and really really regret it. I felt like the animals are in a most unnatural environment having lights on them at night, and living in these glass cages for display. The animals look drugged to stay where they are to ensure that visitors in the train get a view of them. Given the night time, the view of the animals is not very good either so photography is difficult and you would rather see them in a zoo than here at night. If you love animals and care for animal welfare,this is not the safari you want to see. Avoid it!"
,,Very special experience,5.0,,We went here for my daughter's birthday (7) and she absolutely loved it. More than just a normal zoo. Do expect huge queues so avoid weekends if possible and hope it doesn't rain.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"A very unique experience as I had not done anything like this before. My kids also had a great time watching lions, deers, hippos, rhinos, giraffes etc so closely. Some of these animals were left open and they were very close to our vehicles."
,,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and walked along all the tracks,5.0,,"We were lucky that it was quiet, no large parties and plenty of time to look around. It had rained earlier, so that probably had reduced number of visitors. Recommend doing the walking trail rather than the train/tram, you see so much more. D id not use the cafes or shops, so cannot comment on these. We were there until closing and had a taxi back to the city"
,,Brillant,5.0,,Fantastic experience.... On weekends it is crowded and at times becomes frustrating the experience of the safari makes it up. Must visit
,,I hate zoos but this is great.,5.0,,"really good fun. The animals are awake unlike day zoos. You can hear the lions roaring which is fun. We skipped the shows and walked around and in some parts you can feel quite remote.

My tip would be go as late as you can and it won't be so busy. And do get off the team and walk around its very atmospheric."
,,"Nice experience, but VERY busy",4.0,,"Came here after recommendations. Was very, very busy at the 7.15pm entry time, but appeared much worse after this. I recommend you buy 7.15pm tickets online before you travel to Singapore. Can then present your tickets on your phone, at the turn stiles upon entry. Fire show at the entrance (7,8,9pm) and the tram tour takes about 40 minutes. Passing through ''enclosures', with barriers built using natural materials that give a feel of openness. Lots of kids, so it's a noisy experience, but was interesting to see the nocturnal animals awake. Although dark, they use artificial moonlight. There is a 'creatures of the night' show and two trails, which you can walk in the darkness and see animals in their enclosures. As it's 40 minutes from centre of Singapore, recommend using the 'hop on hop off' bus to get here (leaves at 6pm, last return bus at 10pm), as using taxi may be expensive."
,,unusual zoo,4.0,,"Our visit to the night safari was marred by being on a bus tour which didnt allow us enough time to enjoy the event. The tram tour is a must and it great to see the animals up close. We were unable to watch the shows[due to time constraints]. We did do some of the walking trails and these are highly recommended. make sure you have insect repellent and you will feel but not see the insects biting you. I have to say the zoo was not up to the high standard we had come to expect in Singapore, it was a little outdated and chaotic with people just going everywhere and staff trying to herd people into lines for the tours. There is no airconditioning in any of the eateries and they are overpriced. Not a good place to go if it is raining as there is not enough shelter."
,,It is o k .much hyped,4.0,,"Visited this place for night safari. Rush,crowd ,long Q.Nothing very special Road train takes you to and around Zoo.Animals are grouped at different places and habitat of there choice.Artificial lighting ,Men made zoo. 4 to 5 different safari with change in name and mode of at different timings .we took Night safari.Nothing Special,even if you skip this you do not miss any thing provided you have previously visited other zoo. Can be a attraction for child between 5 to15 who can see the animals he might have seen or learned in books."
,,An experience to carry,4.0,,"Night safari is a bit over hyped in my whole trip of Singapore.. A well maintained zoo and a audio guided tour in the night is the key take away, but the cost they charge for it is huge.. Visit once and leave at it.. Nothing exciting apart from travelling inside a zoo in the Night.."
,,"Very good, do some hiking",4.0,,This will be a very good experience if you can get down from those trams to hike through the park. There's much more to explore in that way.
,,Good For Kids!,4.0,,"It is a good attraction for the kids. We were all adults and did not enjoy it as much as kids in other groups did. You dont get anywhere close to the animals and can pleasantly enjoy the tram ride.
It is not a jungle safari. Its more like a tour of the organized township for animals."
,,A not to be missed experience,5.0,,"This zoo is a great attraction, to see Asian animals in their own environment is unique. So many Asian animals feed at night cos it's cooler so most animals can be seen clearly. You can walk or take the little train and hop off when u want to see something specific. I would recommend the Bat enclosure, nothing to be scared of, various bats flying about eating fruit whizzing past you u will never get this close to nocturnal animals in an ordinary zoo. Get there for 7pm to see the keepers and some small animals engaging in a small show very interesting or get there a little earlier to eat first. A not to be missed experience, loved it."
,,1 thing I made sure to come back for,5.0,,"The Night Safari was one of the highlights of my first Singapore trip, and I made sure that I'll go back to this place on our next family trip with our daughter. It didn't disappoint. We went on a Saturday, be sure to go there early as the place gets packed. Don't miss the fire performance near the entrance at 7 PM! Kids and grown ups were amazed by the show.

Oh and the $10 skip the queue tram add-on. Get those! BEST. $10. SPENT. Not only will you get past the loooong lines of both walk-in guests and tour groups, you get to enter the park even if the earlier slots are sold out."
,,Suprisingly crowded,4.0,,Been years since last visited Night Safari. So surprised it's so crowded at night. Had to queue for show and tram ride. Nice ride on tram for a relaxed ride through night safari. Walking will see more animals though.
,,Not really a safari....,3.0,,"It was more like a night time zoo. I picture a safari being driven in a car or a jeep with animals all around you.
Here 80% of the animals are in cages or their sanctuaries and as such felt like a regular zoo.
The tram ride was nice but most zoos do offer tram rides as well.
Most of the animals could not be seen from the trams though so walking is recommended to see them and as such the place should be called a night zoo, not safari.
The fire show at the entrance was great, better than in Hawaii.
The creatures of the night show was very boring. For example, the trainers brought in owls who merely flapped their wings sitting on their arms and left or hyena who just grabbed and dragged a bone for 3 seconds and left.
The lines to the trams were long. This was a Monday night too. Suggest taking the tram later in the evening."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"We visited the night zoo experience. It was a long way from central Singapore and took well over an hour by public transport. Food was very expensive, and not inspiring. Entry to the zoo was also expensive, the queues for the train were long, and although moved quickly, it took quite a while to actually get on a train. Once on the train, the commentary was ok. There were plenty of animals to see in paddocks by the tracks, but several looked distressed, in particular an elephant wanting to join a group of elephants on the other side of the track."
,,K be experience but not twice,4.0,,IF want to experiences ...night visiting with animal...is a not bad ideals.. beside to seen the animal...you can heard the gal gang to screaming.. Compare day zoo we are more prefer. but just have a fun and screaming day !!!
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Good place to visit at Singapore One can enjoy this Night Safari along with family as this attraction has lot of Animals even the African Elephants
,,A must visit,5.0,,"It was the first time I visited for a night safari. After a long wait in long queues, finally my evening started in night safari trams. The whole place is kept silent so people could watch animals. You will get to see different types of animals and observe them. Very nice experience and a must visit when you are in Singapore."
,,Horrible!,1.0,,"I knew from the ticket price that something was just not right here. Im not Joking but I rather wished the staffs changed positions with the animals. Even a chimp well trained would host a fantastic evening. I think most of the guides and staffs are teenagers working after school hours and that they are locals. Iconic theme place like this should have given proper training to its staffs. Most of them were rude and ignorant. The show was lame. Forget OZ but Singapore should be ashamed that even in Thailand, their shows are world class and done with utmost passion.
The tram was jerky and the drivers look like they were driving just to pay off their gambling debts! Totally inconsiderate for tourists wanting to have a better view of the animals. I can do a free service to show how trams can be driven for paying customers to have an enjoyable experience. Please stick to the zoo and i hope Night Safari clean up their amatuer act to save themselves from future shame which im very sure it would be the only thing constant."
,,Nice way to spend an evening,4.0,,"Our expectations were low when we turned up to the night safari. Throngs of people waiting to board the safari trams! That said, we were pleasantly surprised and saw many beautiful animals. Impressed in the end! Certainly a good place to bring kids for an evening's entertainment. You can take public transport there. It's around 45/50 minutes by metro and bus."
,,Long waits,2.0,,"It's a long long queue. Makes it almost impossible with young kids. Too many people. I had gone with aged parents and a 7 year old. Special queue for senior citizens came after a jr wait. The trip is not worth the wait.

I should have visited the zoo in the morning which i skipped.

Only positive in this is the travel from the city to the venue. The drive was good. We took a roof seat in a tourist bus."
,,Parkhopper attraction,4.0,,"We were two families with kids aged 7 and 10. We stay in sg while our friends were visiting us for the first time in SG.
It is very well organized. It's good to start early and catch the firemen in action. Also catch the first creatures of the night show. The flying fox enclosure and nakamurra cave within the complex are highlights of the trail. You may even bump into animals at an arms distance during your walkabout.
If you are a visitor I would recommend the parkhopper ticket and finishing all 3 attractions - zoo, river safari and night safari in the same day - preferably a weekday when the queues will be shorter. Start with the zoo, cover the morning shows followed by the afternoon feeding trail - don't miss the rhino, giraffe feeding which the kids love. Move onto river safari after a quick lunch for walkabout seeing the pandas and doing the amazon ride. Have an early dinner and do the fire show along with the first show for creatures of the night. Some of the later shows get full. Once exhausted, sit on the tram and do a full round.
There are vegetarian options both at the zoo and at the night safari so food should not be a showstopper to keep you going."
,,Very crowded and an average show,3.0,,"Not lived up to the hype that show was talked about. Show few nocturnal animals, birds. Tram ride is good but very crowded. Need to wait 45 mins atleast. Avoid the show, go to tram and walk around in the zoo."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Very good , paid an extra $10 to skip the que for the tram tours and able to access zoo earlier than the hour and a half wait to get in. Worth a visit ."
,,"just like visiting the zoo, but at night.",3.0,,"yeah so this was okay...but expect a bunch of people. Cramped tram to sit on and quick dark views of mostly hooved animals. Two bull elephants plus 3-4 females, white tiger, giraffes...probably the same route you can walk during the day, they take you through at night. There was an informative recorded guide that matched where you were and what animals you were seeing. Very good food for a zoo at the end of the ride."
,,Rain was a problem,4.0,,"We went with a tour group to see the night safari. Our first stop was at the restaurant for our included buffet dinner. The food was just OK, but there were plenty of options. Just as we entered the restaurant it started to pour down rain. This is not uncommon in Singapore. We delayed awhile, but then the rain slowed so we got on the tram that takes you through the part of the park for the night safari. You can't see the animals through the plastic that they rolled down due to the rain so we lifted it. The rain was now a drizzle so it was OK. We did see some animals under the low lights that they have throughout the ride. It is no where near like a real safari but interesting enough. After the tram ride, our guide took us for a short walk down a path that had other nocturnal animals. That's all we were able to see due to the timing of our visit."
,,It's one of the amazing safaris,5.0,,It's a must visit safari. If you are in Singapore you can't miss it. They have a show with animals which happens at 7:15 pm and 8:30 pm and you can't miss. The tram ride is also very good but normally is very crowded so priority pass will do better. Tram ride takes you through the whole park and you can see all the animals. If you are a nature lover you can go for walking trails also. The dinner is not that great.
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,"Took our 12 & 8 year old boys on the 8.15 time slot for the night safari and I wouldn't change a thing! We started the river cruise at 4pm and took our time through there before heading to night safari at around 6.30. We ate at the rotisserie food stall, great chicken and sides priced pretty good at 15.95! During our dinner we saw the fire dance for the 7.15pm guests which the boys loved and then watched it again at our starting time!
Two top tips......... take patience, resilience and mozzie spray. The line is loooooooong with some pushy and at times selfish people around but if you grab an ice cream and jump in the line you will be in soon enough!
All of us loved it, we even rode the tram around twice, getting back to hotel at 1145pm.
A taxi out to safari was $20 or so."
,,Definitely worth doing if you're at the zoo.,5.0,,"Whilst I loved seeing the pandas at Singapore zoo, it was the night safari that was the highlight and made it worthwhile venturing out of the city. A great experience."
,,"Crowded, not much to see",3.0,,"Not worth the long queues, crowded venue, lots of rude pushy people. A few animals can be seen looking bored. Much prefer the daytime zoo."
,,Lovely Zoo Experience with the whole family,5.0,,"This is a wonderful zoo to visit with the whole family. There are a wide variety of animals to view, plenty of options to walk or ride the transports through the park. They night safari was a great experience and the show after was great fun. Whether you have alone, with a significant other, or a young or mature family; this is an experience to be cherished."
,,Exciting Safari in the City,5.0,,"For a ""safari"" in the city, this is amazing. Well worth the long queue; once you're in the tram, it's a relaxing ride seeing all the animals."
,,Not so exciting!,3.0,,Last month me and my wife went for night safari.It is not at all exciting. Firstly in the night most of the animals are visible from the vehicle. Secondly yhe vehicle keeps on moving and do not stop for few seconds so that you view the spot where the animal is.This issue need to be addressed by the management to make the night safari ride more enjoyable.
,,Little dark to see animals,4.0,,Its an unique experience to see animals in the night. The tram could have been slower to allow sufficient time to view the animals since it was dark. The lighting on the animals was also dim for the eye to catch them distinctly. Different experience. Do not miss the night safari animal show.
,,Did the night safari.,3.0,,"I'm not overly keen on zoos but did try the night safari. Incredibly noisy & crowded at the start but handled very efficiently. It was an interesting experience and we did much of it on foot rather than on the train. There are numerous spending opportunities - food, souvenirs, photos etc - which we avoided. Of all the things we did in our 4 days, this was the most missable and expensive."
,,not worth it!!!,1.0,,waiting time endless!!!! too many ppl.. tickets too expensive for what you get!!! never again.. better i went shopping
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"May have been a nice experience if there weren't so many people. I may have been unlucky to go on a Sunday evening when that day was a holiday. My boyfriend and I purchased advanced tickets online, showed up around 6:30 PM hoping to make it for the 7:15 PM entry, but found out the 7:15 and 8:15 were sold out by then, and we had to wait for the 9:15 entry. There were some small aquatic attractions for us to look at while we waited. Around 8:30 PM we went to go line up, only to realize the line must have had a few thousand people in it and was enormous. We didn't get in until 10:15 PM, and by then we were already exhausted from standing and waiting for so long. We planned to take the tram, but they told us it would be 1-1.5 hours wait for it after we got in. Regardless, we jumped in, and luckily it moved quickly so we only waited 30 min. The tram ride took about 35 min. Afterwards we were so exhausted and hot we decided to leave.

The animals were cool to see at night but I don't think it was worth the insane wait times and lines. Additionally, the zoo is pretty far from the rest of the city. Taking the MRT then a bus transfer takes at least an hour and a half, depending on where you are coming from. Taxis are much quicker at 30 minute travel time. When leaving, we saw that there was a bus service being offered from the zoo to major city areas, but the buses looked overcrowded, the desk was full of confused people and the staff guy ignored most questions and did look like he cared much.

Overall, the animals were cool, and it may have been worth it if there were less people."
,,Unique experience- wild life night safari,5.0,,"A road train takes you though the park at night lit by artificial moonlight. A whole host of animals are seen up close in the 40 min tour, there are 2 main walks as well when more animals are seen. The park has many eateries. The toilets are excellent. Can be a very busy place, but well worth the visit"
,,Not so good,2.0,,"Entrance tickets are quite expensive compare to zoo, so that's why we had a lot of expectations. When you look at their flyers as well, you think you will be sooooo close to the animals. Well, you dont. With the tram tour, only 1-2 spices are getting close but it is so dark anyway you cant see. And the rest is still pretty far and some of them weren't even outside. But if you skip the tram and just walk, it is much more fun."
,,Jump the queue Night Safari,3.0,,Well organised and efficient. Buffet meal was excellent but night animal exhibits were not great. Much better value for money and animal experience was the day Zoo which was next door. This was awesome.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Not too far from the center. They have an amuse show with python, wolf, lion which my family really enjoyed. It's great to see the wild life with your own eyes and sometimes you can touch some animals wandering on the road."
,,So cool!,5.0,,"We loved this! It's the zoo at night. There are animal shows, walking trails and a team that runs through the park with a guide explaining all the animals you will see. Elephants, tigers lions, etc. Loved it!"
,,Disappointed,2.0,,I'm not a huge fan of zoos or animals in captivity but was optimistic with going to the night Safari with a Friend. Unfortunately I felt rather sorry for some of the animals that appeared to have very small spaces and the lion looked very skinny.
,,Not that well managed!,3.0,,"People turn up in a huge number during Summers, but the crowd isn't well managed. But The Night Safari is great!"
,,Wonderful tour,5.0,,"This tour is wonderful. You can really see the animals in their prime and the tour guide has so much information about each and every animal.

I think arriving around 8 pm would be perfect as it's just getting dark then. I arrived around 9pm and although it was still great, I felt as though I didn't have enough time.

When travelling, give yourself around an hour and half so that you arrive in plenty of time, there are shops, restaurants and shows if you arrive early.

I got the metro on the red line to Ang Mo Kio and then the 138 bus to the night safari. It was super easy and cheap (I used my metro card that I'd purchased for 3 days, unlimited travel)

One annoying thing - People are complaining about being unable to take photos as it's too dark - well it is a NIGHT safari! Go to the zoo if you would like light, clear photographs! And maybe people should enjoy it rather than being more concerned with photographing it!"
,,"Memorable, informative and great fun",5.0,,"This was a great experience. Despite it being at night(!) the skillful use of lighting meant that many animals could be clearly seen. The show was fun and informative and the land-train gave a very good insight into the many animals. We booked the 7.15pm entrance and, if doing it again, would go straight to the 7.30pm show BUT then do some of the walking trails BEFORE joining the queue for the land-train. This would have greatly reduced the time queuing for it as, by later in the evening, these were much reduced! But we had queued and done it by then!
Highly recommended."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"What we liked most about the night safari was the continual comments about their conservation programs. The animals were all out and about so no problem seeing them, however the only problem was the continual SELFISH tourists who used a flash or a phone torch. They were told dozens of times not to but ignored the park rangers.

If you go, try and get a seat near the front to avoid this issue"
,,Good place different experience,4.0,,Tamed and well behaved animals including Lions and tigers as well. You will see all species of wild animals. They take u in a train with an English speaking guide who keeps giving you the translated view of outside. We loved it. Do see.
,,Must visit,4.0,,"It's different feeling to see the animals during night. As most people of recommended, forget tram. Or first try the tram if the crowd is not much and then do the entire trail. We did all the trails pretty much in less than 2 hours. Do not the miss the events too."
,,One of the better zoo concepts.,5.0,,Went with friends and family. The atmosphere and ambience is good albeit a bit humid(it is beside a nature reserve) Definitely a place to visit but do buy a 3 in 1 Pass that allows you to go to the Zoo and the River Safari.
,,A Must Must in Singapore,5.0,,"The night safari is a Must Must in Singapore. At the entrance fire show. Than creatures at the night show at theatre.
Traintour through the zoo with possibility to get off and walk the leopard walk.
This Zoo is considered as one of the best in the world. During the train tour you get very close to the animals.
Also 10% off the ticket price if you used Singapore Airline. Show boardingpass or tell flight number."
,,Not worth the wait and money,2.0,,"We booked the tickets online paying S$38 instead of S$43 per adult

and on arrival at Zoo at roughly 6.40 pm , there were already a long line of people queuing for the tickets for the tram rides which run every hours starting at 7.15 pm .

Since we bought our tickets online , we have to queue for the paper tickets for the tram ride which was for the 8.15 pm
schedule.

It was a hot and humid evening to wait for an hour out in the open with queues of anxious children and adults

The night safari ride took about 40 minutes and only a few animals were visible from the tram seats . Very disappointing!

We managed to catch the 9.15 pm live animal show called the ” creatures of the night "" which lasted about 30 minutes

The whole evening was not worth the money that I paid and the number of animals that we managed to view , were not too excited to welcome us , either sleeping or hiding behind some rock structures.

Definitely not on my list of "" must do or see"" things in Singapore.

Definitely not ! I rated it 2 out of 10."
,,Forget the tram! Just take the trails.,5.0,,"First of all - if this attraction was tram only, it would get one star, because we waited 60 minutes in queue to board the terribly uncomfortable tram (had to sit diagonally to accommodate my long legs) for a 30 minute ride. SKIP THE TRAM! Go straight to the trails once you've passed the turnstiles. Awesome time roaming around watching the nocturnal animals (and not-so-nocturnal animals). The lions were roaring. The fruitbats were freely flying around us as we walked through their enclosure. Lot's of fun. We were roaming around from 9:30 to Midnight. After a while there's not many people on the tram and you can get back on and take an uncrowded tram ride. TRAILS FIRST! TRAM LATER!"

,,Best way to spend late evening,5.0,,"Some exhibits are plain awesome, for example fishing cats and flying foxes. Some are just cute, like the otter family and pangolin. Some a bit hard to see, and some animals are not even active at night, like giraffe. Some animals clearly have too little space, e.g. the leopard.

Tip1: start on foot, later switch to the tram.

Tip2: try to buy tickets online, if you can't (requires OTP-enabled credit card), buy your ticket in visitors' centre or any tour agent. Queues to buy tickets at the venue are insane.

Tip3: 7:15 or 8:15 are ideal entry times."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The night Safari show nocturnal animals in action. For the best fun, ensure to attend the live show where they show animals perform! Take the tram ride as well."
,,Night safari,5.0,,Very busy to avoid the long queues I would recommend a booked excursion with priority seating .These can be booked at the tour centre at China town
,,Good,5.0,,We enjoyed the evening with some bitter experience as the day light was present till 7:30 so the show became delayed and we had to wait 40 minutes in queue. However the show and the tram journey both was very enjoyable.
,,Ok type attraction!,3.0,,"Nothing amazing about Night Safari! If you have time in the evening, you can come here. Shows are good but safari is not like you are doing it in a jungle/forest. You will sit in the tram and see the animals near by. Wll tru river safari next time."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,You will no regret it. It is amazing to see wild animals so close. Dinner buffet it is so tasty and well served. Another must do in Singapore!!!!!! 👍👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗🤗
,,Not Well Organised - Long Wait,2.0,,"We took the black hop on/off bus to/from. Advice #1 DONT! They are unreliable with scheduling. Got to the park at 7.30pm. after a 50 min ride (said to be 30-40 mins). Had already purchased tickets at Suntech, where we caught the bus. However, we still had to wait in line for another 30+ mins to obtain tickets. Why? We had to join a line that was very very long to gain entry at 8.15pm. The crowd was herded in like cattle. Too many people provided tickets without facilities to cater for such large crowds. We waited for over 35 mins ie 8.50pm when an announcement was made -no further entry until crowds (already inside) had cleared. We walked through at approx 9pm. The night safari show was full (it started at 8.30pm). The crowds waiting to get on the trams to do the night safari were horrendous ....long long wait (again). We had to leave without seeing anything as the last return bus left at 10pm. Advice #2: take a taxi to/from as there will be more flexibility. Be mindful it's quite a distance from the city so this can be costly. Advice #3: Arrive at 7pm (when it opens) or after 8pm ( when crowds were less). It appears the 7.15 or 8.15pm entries are most popular. The park is open to midnight (I believe -check). The food is very expensive - even the ice cream! Too many tickets are issued for entry without proper crowd controls in place or consideration of the practicalities ie how many people can this complex comfortably hold, manage and give a positive, lively experience too. There must be a better method than what is currently in existence."
,,Was okay... Mostly went for night safari,5.0,,"The night safari was cool. The zoo is about a 20 minute taxi ride from downtown area. The variety of animals is cool.

If you go to the night safari, they have restaurants to eat St before it opens. That makes for a nice evening for families and friends with a good variety of food options."
,,Not what its cracked up to be,2.0,,"Almost all the big animals were dozing off
so was pretty boring on the train, long wait to get on and glad it was over when it finished. And I'm suspicious the rhino which wasn't standing up and pretty far away was mechanical and not real. On the other hand, the night show was good with the nocturnal animals and the guy was funny."
,,Not that great,1.0,,You talk about prohibition of flash photography. How about the harsh flash lights focussing on animals during night safari?? Why are you stressing the animals to go through this? I also saw few animals tied as well !!! Absolutely ridiculous to do this to make the night safari successful. I was expecting more animal interaction in the zoo and it was very disappointing experience.
,,Wonderful experience to cap off a day of sightseeing or shopping,5.0,,The staff were amazing with the whole setup especially with so many visitors on the night. The Creatures of the Night show was entertaining and worth watching. Just make sure to get good seats near the front and close to the middle. This will also increase your chances of getting picked as a volunteer. Walking around it wasn't crowded and we were lucky enough to see almost all the animals walking around at night. The tram was of course extremely popular and worth doing though the line was LONG. Again staff were great and kept everything under control. The safari was really nice and informative. Highly recommend!
,,"Was OK,.not brilliant",3.0,,"Long long queue for everything. They hurdle you in like cattle. Show was OK but not brilliant. Tour of the actually safari was good once you were on a train. Which again you had to queue for about 30 mins. Food choices are pants. It's expensive, limited. Half the food resorts don't have anywhere to stand. Too many people pushing for food. And the taste was sub standard. The Safari was miles away so taxi is best to get there."
,,Overrated! Waste of time,1.0,,"We went here with high expectations due to reviews we read but came out utterly disappointed. This is one of the worst in Singapore. If you are on a tight sched and budget..it is best to avoid this.

Time duration- The Zoo advertises the night safari to open at 7:30 to 12pm but never did any ad medium here mention that to actually gain entrance by 7:30 sharp in order to enjoy the park, you have to be here by 5:00!! Yes almost 3 hours earlier.

And that is because of the stupid and inefficient park processing of guests. Imagine we bought already tickets online, and it has a bar code similar to Universal Studios..so supposedly, assuming the usual efficiency of SG, we assumed that we would be let in as soon as we got there which was around 7:15pm. But to our frustration, we were made to line up to process e tickets where it was manned by only 2! persons who were taking their slow sweet time time processing us. All in all, we were issued NEW tickets around 9:pm!!! And then the lines for the actual entrance were so long..we gained entry a little past 10pm already! Talk about wasted time. This park is the highlight of SG stupidity.

With no time to try out the walking trails and we were too tired due to our long wait standing up..we were left with the option of the tram ride. It was ok and a nice experience but was ruined by the ride drivers Impatience!! As we were passing by different animal locations..we practically have no time enjoying the scene as by then after he points at the animals..he just basically passes thru and never stops even for just a minute. We paid but we never got our money's worth. Sure we were excited to see the animals but it was dark and we wanted to take in the scene and enjoy it but sadly..the rushed viewing was totally a RIP OFF!

So in closing.. Avoid this attraction. And don't waste money and energy dealing with the highlight of Singapore people inefficiency."
,,"Absolute must visit, buy dual tickets for the Night Safari, Bring bug spray",5.0,,"Price - it will cost an adult around 50 SGD for both the zoo and the night safari. I would highly recommend purchasing the dual ticket - buy an early night safari ticket (19:30) as the zoo typically closes at 18:00 and there is an excellent food court at the night safari area.

The zoo was incredible and well laid out with many different feeding times for the animals. The selection of animals available to see was phenomenal and it's easy to see why this is the best zoo in Asia.

Being in the heart of a rainforest - I recommend spraying yourself and carrying around big spray, particularly around your feet, ankles and shins as there are varying critters from ticks to mosquitoes."
,,Better than the normal zoo,4.0,,It's nice to see the animals more active as the temperature drops and the drive round train is fantastic! It is possible to do it all in 3 hours (to get the last duck and hippo bus back). A great idea and the fire show at the beginning was a nice surprise.
,,"It's an ok evening... but if you can only do one, do the zoo instead",3.0,,"Billed as the only 'night safari', the concept is an intriguing one. What works? The creatures of the night show is good & recommended. Seeing a few of the nocturnal animals you don't see daytime in the zoo is nice. And it's a cooler time of day to be outdoors vs. the zoo. What could be better? Queues can be an issue. And the tram that takes you around the enclosures is over much too soon, one can't pause and enjoy the animals for too long. It seems the animals know just when to come present themselves in the spotlight, then probably go back & nap! I've done the zoo and night safari multiple times, and would overall pick the zoo every time if I had the choice. Just go nice and early when it opens to avoid the peak heat!"
,,Good experience,4.0,,Our first night safari and enjoyed the same. Long queue but moves pretty fast. We could sight quite a few animals and a very neat and organised place. Great for kids.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Mg kids love it to the max. Make sure you watch the show, kids surely love them. We took the tram ride to see the animals. As it is night time, we couldnt see all of the animals as some of them were hiding and sleeping. The foods there were great but expensive. Make sure you bring your own water bottle, we went during night time and it was still very hot and humid."
,,Disappointing.,2.0,,"The night safari was not worth the money. It felt like a glorified zoo with poor commentary on the tram trip and little opportunity to spend time observing the animals. There was the option to walk some or all of the trails which made it possible to go at a your own speed. The fishing cats were cool!
The trails were a little challenging with a wheelchair."
,,Nigh safari,4.0,,It was a lovely experience. Was crazy busy tho. We went with the hotel so we got to skip all the lines I suggest you do that. Food was great there.
,,okay to see but super crowded and not enough time,3.0,,"Booked the transfer and tickets through Duck Hippo and first bus out to zoo was at 6pm and then time go there was just crowded. First went to the creatures of the night and a bit disappointed as only saw a few animals, then went to the tram but very long queues and quite dark, not able to see that well. Last time here went to zoo in day and 100% so much better, more to see. If was going to choose the day Singapore Zoo is far superior, beautiful to walk around, allow 1/2 day, just so much better than the night safari, didnt need to queue through the day park is so spacious."
,,Worth a visit - expect to queue,4.0,,"This is definitely a must see in Singapore. Once you arrive (20 min taxi ride from city, approx £18) you are only allowed to enter in hour slots. This causes a problem when waiting for the tram tour around the park as the queue was 45 mins. To avoid its queue it's best to go as late as possible.

Food and drinks are available to buy whilst you wait for your slot. Once inside you can walk around the park if you don't wish to wait in the long queue in the heat."
,,enjoyable but crowded,4.0,,"It was a very unique experience and I would not be surprised to see this night zoo spring up in other countries. We knew going in this was not a ""safari"" but a zoo and I think if you go with that in mind you won't be disappointed - almost all the animals were awake and moving around - we took the tram first and then walked around - and although they encouraged us to do it the other way around the line up was way shorter for the tram early in the evening - later on it was really long so glad we did not listen to them. I think kids will love the bat cave where they actually fly loose around you. As I said before a very unique experience"
,,Worth for a visit,4.0,,"It was the second time for time.. I'm still convinced that, if you have limited time, a walking visit is better than a train visit. The train is noisy and doesn't allow visitors to enjoy the night sounds of animals with the necessary quite."
,,Great concept but disappointing,2.0,,"Having been told by friends that this was a great tour we decided to give it a go. the first encounter was the price of tickets, if you front up to buy tickets at the place be prepared to pay SGD $45 a ticket, however if you book on line through a third party site you pay only SGD $33.50 and you could also get a further discount depending on who you go through. So buy your tickets online. The second encounter was queueing for the trams that take you around the park, after a 55 minute wait we eventually got on one. The next encounter was the inability to see the animals. When there was a good oppurtunity to take photos (no flashes) the tram would not stop. The next encounter was the live animal show, another queue but a lot faster than the first only 25 minute wait. The presenter was talented enough to keep the crowd entertained but only five animals were presented. They are talented but having seen the bird and seal show at Taronga Zoo Sydney this show was ordinary in comparison. The next encounter was the visit had come to an end and the experience was to get back into town. Word of advice would be
1. Buy your tickets online
2. Book your transport or use the MRT and buses, taxis are expensive
3. Don't go on the tram, take the walkways you are likely to see more and get some great photos.
4. The show is alright, but get to the first one. This will allow you to see more.

If you think I am picking on the place I am not. As I said it is a great concept but needs a lot of improvement."
,,Still nice set up but too busy,3.0,,"It was really nice 10 years ago. The set up is still great but way to full and overbooked, which makes the experience for us no longer interesting or pleasant. However, should be part of the ""to do"" list when in SG."
,,Unique way to see animals,4.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari is a refreshingly different way to enjoy seeing animals from usual daytime zoo visits. I went there with my family and it was a fun outing. There's an animal show before the main touring begins, which should be more attractive for the younger generation. Visitors are shown around the park in battery powered trains. Walking trails are also available. The animals themselves are quite varied and interesting to see at night. (A common lizard jumped on my head and sped off!) Points to remember: avoid rainy nights as the animals will mostly be in shelters. The trains are wheelchair friendly. There are foodshops at the Safari but the selection is somewhat limited."
,,Not worthy,3.0,,I was expecting a much more than simply a small zoo in the night..that's what it really is..and because it's (night);many of animals you won't be able to see well because of insufficient lights..visiting the zoo would be more fun if you want to see some animals. .
,,unique,5.0,,"Great oppurtunity to see the animals active at night, very different than the others zoo. take the parc hoper option and visit the zoo during the day"
,,"Very touristy, rather sad enclosures, not sure if as animal friendly as advertised!",3.0,,"Definitely go with a tour and pay the extra for fast track to the bus. Initially it was amazing, needing to acclimatise to the darkness and the noise and then catching a glimpse of an animal. HOWEVER, the enclosures are mostly very small and all the animals, tigers, lions, elephants are brought to the front to feed. I did ask our guide whether the enclosures are opened up at the back for them to have more room after the night safari and during the day but she didn't know? Apparently they have a very successful breeding program but the whole place just didn't feel right. We did not go to the very over crowded show at the end of the evening, but instead our guide took us for a little walk were we did see Ocelots fishing for their dinner in a running stream that looked more natural and some other smaller animals in larger enclosures. Obviously if you have a larger enclosure you may not get to see the animals but better that they are well looked after I feel. A buffet dinner was included which was quite varied and good, but drinks extra and very expensive. Have mixed feelings about the whole place!"
,,Nothing Great about it!,3.0,,"I would not recommend at all if you are not a KID. Its a big disappointment as they tell you to see the animals in open. However, they still show but there is nothing exciting. All the animals seems to be tamed and trained. Its okay if you do not visit it. There are still some more exciting things to do. If you have kids - they might enjoy. No flash cameras to be used - Hence no pictures (unless you have a HD priced camera!)"
,,Shocking waste of money !!!,1.0,,What a waste of time and money. The ride around was an embarrassment - the animals looked half dead - if you could see anything. My only disappointment in Singapore. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Definitely a must do. There is a lot to see and if you are lucky you will see a lot a animals. It does get very busy so book in advance as you don't have to queue for long for a tram. If you want to have something to eat there are plenty of places to eat.
,,Great fun,5.0,,This was our second time to go on the Night Safari. our last visit was about 4 years ago and it is still a wonderfully unique adventure. Our young children loved the ride in the trams as well as the fire show presented later in the evening. There is food and drink available. I imagine during peak season it gets very crowded. Our outing was moderately crowded. You can also walk trails as well as riding the trams. This is a must see if you are visiting Singapore.
,,great,5.0,,Nice experience with Live animals in the night with a great live show. What an anchoring in the live show. Great appreciation to the lady who anchored on 23 April 7.30 show. Must see this
,,Fun - but pricey,3.0,,"I enjoyed the experience, however you don't really see much!! Additionally, you are not 'meant' to use flash photography, which makes it hard to take any images while there.

I come from Australia, so maybe my expectations were set too high... Our zoos here are pretty amazing..!!

You have the option to catch a shuttle tram or walk - I highly suggest the walk as you see SO much more than the tram. You are also able to do it at your own pace and not be held back or sped up.

I've rated the experience average, as at $45 a person, it's quite expensive for what you actually get and see!"
,,Book in advance!,5.0,,"Once we'd established that arriving at 7:25pm for the 7:30 opening meant we'd only really be able to get tickets for the 9:15pm opening we were a little disappointed. However that was our fault for not having booked in advance. Thankfully there are enough cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops to keep you entertained for a while if you make the same mistake. Also, what was very handy was the River Cruise was still partly open until 8:30, so we managed to have a wander around that exhibit and discovered a newly founded phobia of Indian Gharials.

The zoo itself was wonderful, though a chaotic entrance, once you make it on to the walking path, it's not too difficult to extricate yourself from the large, loud families. I would recommend doing the walking tour first and finishing your Night Safari on the tram.

The animals were majestic, and it is easy to see why this zoo has such a draw on both locals and tourists. It's a wonderful way of conserving animals and educating people.

Watching a bat urinate on a duck was a personal highlight, and then discovering that the clouded leopard has only three legs was astounding. For any age, the night safari has a lot to offer and should definitely be on the list of things to do when you visit Singapore."
,,Disgusted....,1.0,,"$150 dollars wasted and a holiday weekend ruined.

Queued for 45 minutes to get in, despite having a timed entry ticket. Queue for the shuttle bus was an hour and the only exhibition was announced full before we got past the entry point.

My personal highlight was being told by a lady by the name of Nurul that I don't care what you think, it's busy, get over it.

That's the caring attitude of an employee determined never to get my repeat business.

Well done night safari, you let too many people in and hired rude, aggressive staff with insufficient training to deal with people who feel aggrieved at the poor experience you subjected my family to."
,,Great!,5.0,,"A visit to the night safari is a must when in Singapore. It is great for all ages and very well organised. There can be a bit of a wait to board the train, but the line moves pretty quickly. The animal show is also good. We booked the 7.15 arrival time, went to the animal show first and then boarded the train for the trip around the zoo. We were a large extended family group with small children and this timing was perfect for us. The night safari can be reached by train and bus but if you have young children taxi/uber is a better option as it is quite a distance from the city. We purchased a park hopper plus pass which is a very reasonable way to visit the night safari, the zoo, the river safari and the Jurong bird park."
,,Silent Animals at the night!,5.0,,"It is a different experience to see animals at the night in low light, in tram. These animals are well conserved and they enjoy their stay!"
,,Private tour must have,5.0,,"When on a private buggy tour around the zoo and it was amazing, our guide was very friendly and informative. Definitely worth the extra money!"
,,Prepare for a very long wait when you arrive,3.0,,1 Massive queue 2 Short ride 3 the trams don't stop at the animals so photos are very hard to take The queue to get on the trams took over an hour
,,Not Surprising... Night Safari ...,3.0,,"We Chose night safari, we visited many Zoos in USA, India and South Africa but this is very small and nothing surprising. Mysore and Chennai-Vandaloor zoo are better than Singapore. If you been to Mysore or Vandaloore/Chennai better don't waste your money."
,,We loved this adventure @ night,5.0,,"We visited Singapore in March and went on the Night Safari with our eight-year old daughter and the entire family really liked this experience. Since Singapore is so hot nighttime is a great time to go out and they have an excellent array of nocturnal animals with space to move... they also give you the option to take a tram or get off at several spots to go at your own pace.

We did both. We even thought about going back again the next evening but found some other fun things to do in Singapore.

Great experience and accommodates families with children very well."
,,"Interesting and fun, good for kids.",4.0,,"Tickets are in fact include the tram ride. Went during weekend, rather crowded, especially need to queue for 1 hour for the show. Interesting show."
,,Please never recommend us to take SAEx!!!,2.0,,"OK, it's not really about Night Safari, but it's about the fact that they are recommending us to take SAEx as one of the transport options. The worst thing I have done in my whole trip in Singapore is to have booked a shuttle with SAEx from Balestier to Night Safari. I paid but no bus show up.
(OK for Night Safari, watching animals at night is still a great fun. But I spent a lot of time queuing up to redeem a ticket - not even buying it - and queuing up just to enter the park! I was late so it didn't leave me sufficient time for the visit, thanks to SAEx.)

This is the story: I went to the SAEx website and check out a return trip for two from the cart, after selecting my departure times at Balestier and Night Safari -- a time a selected on their system. So transaction completed, and I thought it's settled. But there was actually no confirmation that a bus will be waiting for me (at where and when). The worst thing I could imagine happened. There's no bus coming at the time I 'booked' at my departure stop.

So I called the '24-hour hotline' +65 6753 0506 to seek assistance. No one is picking up the phone. Eventually I called the Night Safari Guest Relations for help. That's when I learned that the SAEx bus is supposed to pass through my stop according to the timetable no matter what and I should be able to hop on the bus. (And I have waited for half and hour. Nothing came.)

Same logic -- if the SAEx booking system allows me to book a bus returning from Night Safari to Balestier at 12:05 a.m., there should be a bus for me to hop on anyway. I asked the guy standing at the 'City Transfer' booth, which according to Night Safari is the booth of SAEx. The guy said there's no bus and all SAEx staff should have gone home. I hop on a taxi immediately. If there's a bus on 00:05, shouldn't the company leave someone here to guide the passengers?

Extremely terrible service. To conclude:
1. Night Safari should not have recommended SAEx on their website.
2. SAEx should be forbidden from charging their passengers beforehand, if the bus is not coming anyway.
3. OK if the booking thing is going on, SAEx should tell the passenger when and where the bus will come.
4. If the passenger finds that the bus is not coming, the '24-hour hotline' should be available to the confused passenger.
5. The 'timetable' of SAEx is extremely confusing, especially when I am allowed to book a trip that may not exist on the system."
,,Night zoo,4.0,,Good to something at night. The ride gave you an attraction without walking. Great audio while going around Recommend as a night event
,,Nice tourist attraction,5.0,,Interesting place.. good variety .. options of walking around or taking tram .. animals freely roam around that caged .. creepy shows with fun.. so all these make it a good tourist attraction..
,,Nice,4.0,,"It was nice to go at night for a different view of the zoo and the animals, was very busy as on a Friday night but worth it for something different"
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Decided to do something different with the night safari, it was good but was very busy as I went on a Friday night"
,,Very disappointing,3.0,,"Was really looking forward to this safari but it was a disappointment. Just people everywhere. Felt like we were sheep being herded on a farm.
Lucky we booked as a tour group otherwise we would have been waiting for ages. It seems all they really care about is the money and not the experience. Very commercialised. The tram drove way too fast and you got minimal chance to see a lot of the animals."
,,"5 Star experience, 4 star zoo",5.0,,"The feel of a night exploration of rare nocturnal wildlife is great. Lots of animals to see and a large park to explore. I would advise taking the tram first, then trek the paths that interest you. Expect that some animals might be hard to see, if at all. It is understandable that they may not know that they're supposed to be on exhibit. Go to the show; although short, its informative, entertaining and fun. Good value for money. Don't worry about the transpo back to the city. There are lots of buses available."
,,Wonderful Night Time Animal Experience,5.0,,"I went with a small group, after I was done with, River and Zoo, the next thing was Night Safari all three are in the same place. The place opens at 7:00pm , there was a huge queue, took about 20 mins to enter, once you enter, you again queue up for creatures of the night show or tram ride, we choose, the tram ride, which animals were kept at a distance from us, the Lion , flamingos were a good attraction. There was even a walking trail, but since morning we were at the zoo, river safari, we were exhausted and decided to wrap it up."
,,Great experience,4.0,,We need to walk a lot to enjoy completely. but its really worth. And you can find really good food at the end of the trip
,,Different,3.0,,"We came here because it looked interesting but actually it was a let down as you really couldn't see the animals much.
We paid extra for a buffet dinner which was a let down as the food was mediocre with no atmosphere as it was a large area with only a handful of people eating.
The best bit was walking round ourself to get a better look at all the animals.
Very clean & helpful staff though.
I'd probably give it a miss & go to normal zoo if I were you."
,,Night visit was good,4.0,,"We joined a tour for this and found that we really didnt have as much time as we would have liked - it was a bit rushed and the waiting was irritating.
I am glad we went at night because the day visit would have been unbearably hot for us.
Plan your your own visit and take your time."
,,Must do,5.0,,"I visited this 17 years ago and enjoyed it, so went with my wife this time. It is good fun but packed so go for the first entry at 7:15 pm to allow time. Lots of places to eat as well."
,,A wonderful and special place and experience,5.0,,This is a must visit if you are interested in animals and would like to see many you have never seen before. The tram ride element is a must and takes you past so many wonderful beasts. It's hot and steamy but well worth it.
,,Great concept but you can do better things in your evening,3.0,,"IMHO, this is one of the much-hyped attractions in Singapore. there are long lines waiting outside the entrance may seem this is something that must not be missed at any cost. Not so.
they take you on a tram that goes around the zoo for about an hour with an instructor talking relentlessly about the sleeping animals.
Perhaps the trekking paths may be interesting.. but nothing great about this."
,,Stupid zoo,1.0,,Nothing great about this place as going to a zoo is more exciting than taking this night safari. Due to night and low lighting you can't see the animals properly and miss many on the way. The bus runs fast too so its not possible to spot the animals on the way. It's waste of time and money.
,,Good attraction,4.0,,"The Singapore night zoo is famous around the world. We booked the Park hopper ticket which gives you access to the River Safari, the Singapore Zoo, the Night Safari and bird sanctuary. As we had been st the other attractions during the day we booked the 7.15 entry. Unfortunately everyone else did the same thing which meant it took us nearly one and a half hours of lining up to get into the Night Safari.

If possible I suggest a later time since when we came out at around 9.30 there was no waiting.

Putting that inconvenience to one side the attraction is very good. There is is also a good selection of food available on site."
,,Elena,5.0,,"Excellent experience and it is as they promote it. You see lions, tigers and other animals in their habitat with no enclosure and you are sitting in an open tram."
,,"Miss the animal show, very boring",3.0,,"Don't do the animal show use your time better by walking the trails. When we went it was so busy queues for everything, we did like the ride and seeing the animals at night but overall we were dissapointed"
,,Zoo with a difference,5.0,,"An excellent facility in which to see nocturnal animals in their own habitat. Enclosures are by way of open ditches, bankings, and vegetation hedges. Tram ride takes you through various enclosures and there is the opportunity to walk marked trails."
,,Brilliant concept,5.0,,"Wonderful experience here. Visited this about 12 years ago and they have vastly improved. More animals, unadulterated views of the animals extremely close to the trams. Only disadvantage is you cannot take flash photography and since it is during the night time phone photography will not do justice. A recent addition i think is a fire dance, which was amazing, just before the Safari begins. Also, it is a fair distance away from the city."
,,Fun in the jungle,5.0,,The night safari is great. Options to walk it or take a tram. Features nocturnal animals only in a very unique environment. If you can - walk! Recommend long pants and covered arms to protect against mosquitos and walking shoes or runners if walking as there's quite a bit to see.
,,Hot and humid but worth it,4.0,,We went with a tour group which was good as we didn't have to line up for tickets. Well set up facility and worth the visit.
,,"Crazy busy, well managed, but just not worth it",2.0,,"Lots of people said to do the Night Safari whilst in Singapore and whilst it was ok it wasn't brilliant. The line up is HUGE to get in. It is well managed but for the price you pay the line up takes longer than the actual safari.
The guide was good but we wished they had reinforced that people should be quiet. It really ruined the experience. I understand that little kids get excited, but adults don't need to be so ridiculously loud.
We wanted to walk some of the trails after the safari but we were over it by then and just wanted to get out.
I wouldn't do this again and wouldn't recommend it either. Not good value and many of the animals are in small enclosures."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Really good way to see animals up close. Saw everything on the tram ride and the leopard trail. Animals were all active and alert. Excellent attraction
,,Do yourself a favour- Well worth a visit !,5.0,,"Do yourself another favour & don't wear yourself out before your visit! And Eat before you go!
The queues, although reasonably fast moving, for Night Safari are daunting, but don't be put off! I hate queuing for anything but Night Safari is definitely worth grinning & bearing it!
We made the mistake of exiting the Zoo & heading for food & refreshment before joining the queue. We had booked the very popular 7.30 time slot, as had nearly 2000 other people! We ended up the very back & off to the side of a very large amphitheater, where our talk was to be. As a result our view was occasionally obscured. Nevertheless, it was an interesting talk.
After the talk, more queuing & the obligatory tourist photo! The 40 minute tram trip that followed was fantastic! It is a behind the scenes & up close look at the Zoo animals. Some of them are surprisingly close to the tram & seem unfazed by the commentary of our well informed guide.
The tram ride is followed by night walks through various areas. There is a choice of 4 & we thoroughly enjoyed the Wallaby Trail. We wished we had time & stamina to do them all . Next time for sure!"
,,amazing night tour,5.0,,"if you want to see animals in natural surroundings with all the smells of the jungle this is definitely the place to visit.. there are a number of different walks - the rain forest section is unbelievable, the night time safari takes you past a vast range of animals from lions, deer, tigers, buffalo, and many you have never heard of or seen before, its a fabulous experience. good food courts (asian). Start with the open train tour and then work out what you want to see, each section takes about 20 minutes and the time flys by. each animal enclosure is big and the animals have all the natural smells and surroundings as if they were in the wild. a not to be missed excursion."
,,Its a ZOO,3.0,,They go on about conservation but looking at the plight of some of the animals it leaves a lot to desire weather they do Night safari just a total waste of money time and effort
,,Nice,5.0,,The night safari was awesome u went on a tram and it took around all of the animals I saw a 2 black bears! The show was amazing mad me and my mum scared!
,,Lovely Experience,4.0,,"Allow some time to get in, then hopp on the tram and enjoy the beautiful trip around the park.

You can see a lot of animal quite close to the tram which is amazing.

All the animals are quite busy during the night what makes is almost always possible to see them.

Also some nice walking trails that take you close to the animals as well.

It seems that the park is less busy after around 8pm so maybe better book a little bit later.

Overall a wunderful experience and we would recommend to everyone."
,,Line and line endless line,2.0,,In a very hot and sultry day it was difficult to stand in que for almost an hour to just get in. A better and more humane way should be looked into. Most Indian animals seen in almost all Indian zoos are here packaged and shown to credulous tourist. Ruth and creatures of the night show was the only saving grace.
,,A Zoo with an unique night life experience,4.0,,"Though one of the most popular Zoos of Singapore (not an easy task in a city-state which boasts of some of the world's finest animal enclosures) and does provide an altogether different kind of night-life-in-the-zoo experience, but the time you can spend in the zoo is quite limited (4 to 5 hours at maximum) and it is quite difficult to walk through all the trails to visit each and every animal enclosure. If you are also very enthusiastic about taking photographs of animals in a zoo, obviously this is not the right place, unless you've a very powerful prime lens, you won't be able to take good photographs of the animals in the dark. And of course you shouldn't use the flash.

Having said the above, if you are looking for a unique zoo experience at night and want to see some nocturnal animals which would only come out after dark, ""Night Safari"" is a good opportunity to do that.

Before you enter the safari, right at the entrance courtyard you can watch the ""Thumbuakar Performance"" which is very entertaining, mainly you've kids with you they will love it or if you've never seen the fire blowing tricks. Check out the timings, which are likely to be at 6:45 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm & 10 pm.

Once you enter the zoo, I would recommend you to hop on to the zoo trams as there is lot to cover and riding on the trams do gives opportunity to cover a lot. As chances of taking very good photographs are remote, it would rather make sense to see as much as you can. And also you can hop off and hop on to the tram any number of times from number of junctions. This gave us the opportunity to see some animals in our second ride which we couldn't see in the first ride. Some of the animals which we saw while on the tram rides were like ""Bharal"", ""Barsingha"", ""Stripped Hyena"", ""Asiatic Lion"", ""Giraffe"", ""African White Lion"", ""Barteng"", ""Malayan Tapir"", ""Red Dhole"", ""Asian Elephant"", ""Sambhar Deer"", ""Indian Wolf"", ""Asian Rhinocerous"", ""Thamin"", ""Gaur"", ""Asiatic Black Bear"", ""Ankole Cattle"" and the ""Malayan Tiger"".

After you've taken at least one tram ride, then you can start taking the walking trails. Unfortunately for us as we were running out of time we couldn't take all the trails. We were just able to take the ""Wallaby Trail"" and ""East Lodge Trail"" and watch animals like ""Wallaby"", ""Baboon Tarantula"", ""White Lipped Python"", ""Babirusa"", ""Red River Hog"", the rare ""Bongo"", ""Spotted Hyena"", ""Serval"" and the ""Sloth Bear"" quite closely.

Also we opted to see the ""Creatures of the Night Show"". Looking back at it, unless you are really enthusiastic about animal game shows, you can surely skip this, you aren't going to miss much and it will save you a lot of time. The show takes a lot of time to get started, to allow the audience to settle down and then it is nothing extra ordinary. If we'd have skipped the show, we could have probably cover more of the walking trails. However if you've kids with you, then might enjoy the show.

Overall ""Night Safari"" gives a different kind of zoo experience, which is why it is worth a visit. Those who intends to take buses/taxis to get back to your respective destination, I think you can be rest assured that late buses/taxis are available."
,,Night visit,4.0,,"This was an interesting night out. The train ride around the zoo was great. We later walked around the same route and saw the animals in their very natural looking habitats.
The show felt a bit contrived and we were not too disappointed to have to leave to meet our shuttle bus."
,,Enjoy the company of wild life close to you!!,5.0,,"Different experience from regular zoos. The train ride or a walk among those animals is really amazing . If you are going with small kids, train ride is better. If Not, one will enjoy walking in the zone. Definitely worth a revisit."
,,A Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed this experience. To be able to see some of these marvellous animals being active at night was amazing. My advice is to take the tram ride as soon as you enter to orient yourself to the layout of the park and what animals can be viewed, then go for a walk along the marvellous paths that wend their way through the complex. A great night out!"
,,Must-do for Singapore,5.0,,"This is my favourite attraction in Singapore. Located just next to the Singapore Zoo, so it is best to spend the day in Singapore Zoo and then the evening in Night Safari (it doesn't open until 7 ish I remember).
There are big electric carts to tour you around the park, but do queue up early, as the queue was very long when I went (we waited for nearly 1 hour for the cart). And remember to shut your flashlight off when you take photos, we had some very ""stupid"" and ""stubborn"" tourists on our carts whom kept on taking photos of lions and other animals (couldn't remember exactly which animals but definitely carnivores!) with the flash on, and we were very worried that the carnivores got triggered and jumped over the trench to attack us!!!"
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,It may be one of its kind had fire show a animal creature show live well guided and tram trail in the night where you have same fun like singapore zoo the difference is we can visit in night I suggest Night Safari to tourist as the attraction us very similar to Singapore Zoo all three attraction including river safari are in the same location
,,Nice place if travelling with family esp. Kids,5.0,,"The place is good animals can be easily spotted there are various packages you can opt from depending on your preferences.
Before the gates open everyone gathers at a point close to door and there is a little fire show done then you enter the property but to tell you the place when i visited was really crowded pleople pushing and running just to get in fast i dont know why but yes this happened.
however once you get in you have to wait for your number the coaches arrive and then there is plenty of space in coaches they make sure that everyone gets a seat and then the safari begins all the animals can be spotted easily.
the staff again is really Helpfull and super friendly.
post safari there are many souvenir shops and restaurants offering food from all.
we had dinner in one of the Indian restaurants there and it was super good. trust me the Restaurants have really good food.

Thanks"
,,Happy Good Friday,5.0,,"We went here on Good Friday. As expected, it was packed however service was excellent. They have systematic way especially when dealing with very loooooong queues. Trams were coming almost every 3 mins. It was my third and first time for my hubby and son. We happily saw and watched the animals while ee were all seated comfortably."
,,An Excellent Experience!,5.0,,A Must Visit when in Singapore. The tram is a good way to be able to see all the animals from a distance. It is safe and a good experience to be able to see all the animals in their natural habitat. A Must visit for everyone.
,,Unbelievable!!!!,5.0,,"The evening did not start well ..... the crowds were huge and we were queuing for a 2015 entry from 1945. Throngs of people just standing in heat and humidity. Once inside, it took is 45min in the tram queue, but this moved steadily. So moods were not great initially .....

But when the tram ride started, we were left breathless. Every pen had animals and they were so close. The tour explanation was great, and pace was good. They have large animals like elephants, rhino and lions which were very impressive. It is more like a safari than a zoo. Our kids are still talking about it. Afterwards you can walk some trails, but for families with kids, the tram ride pretty much covers it.

So be prepared for an initial mass scrum, but the end result is worth it."
,,Seen better,2.0,,After seeing the advertising for this attraction I decided to go as I'd never been to a zoo at night before. I found the experience didn’t meet expectations as the 'show' came across as too scripted to me and the animals weren't anything too different from other animal habitats I'd visited. It was quite crowded to access both inside and out.
,,Night trip,5.0,,Excellent. I have been to many zoos in the US and try to go to a zoo whenever we travel. Singapore Zoo is really nice and special as it is open at night. Really unique. Highly recommend.
,,Enjoyed the night safari tram,4.0,,"The tram was a great way to see the animals and hear some history and facts with tour guides.
A little bit pricey if you can only manage the tram and can't walk around the trails at $33 Singapore dollars. However was great to see the animals not caged up with only a ditch between the path and them. (With exception of the tiger).
Had a quick bite to eat in the food area just before the exit which was quite sufficient."
,,Do Visit,5.0,,A great place for kids. Around 45 minutes ride by tram. You can see animals next to you expect lion and tigers and few other man eaters. Its a n experience.
,,Tram ride,3.0,,Quite disappointing. There were not many animals to see n most of them quite lethargic seeing that they are supposed to b nocturnal animals. The food there is utterly expensive . It's not a place I would recommend highly to a tourist or singaporean.
,,Great idea but not nocturnal,2.0,,The idea of going on safari thru a zoo at night to experience nocturnal animals in a semi free range way is great. The Night Safari is very well set up runs like Singaporeans do most things -like clockwork. The thing is most of the animals aren't nocturnal so they are asleep. The experience depends on what side of bus/tram you r on and you don't get to see anything that you don't get during day.
,,Good fun,4.0,,"Busier than we thought it'd be, the night safari provided a good evenings entertainment. Get off at the one stop the tram does and explore the animals otherwise you'll miss some gems (the bats and big cats in particular) and it'll be over too quickly too."
,,Boring,1.0,,Boring place to visit... If u love animal to watch thn only go for it... Rest pls dont waste money...
,,Unpleasant visit.,2.0,,"Too crowded. Every half an hour there is fire show by two dancers, which will keep you awaken during your looong wait."
,,Interesting experience you don't normally see!,4.0,,"We did the Night Safari as we were told it was really good, otherwise we may not have done it. Certainly glad we did! It was very interesting seeing all the different animals at night time, going about there business. It was good sitting on an open bus which had an audio tour, given you don't know what each animal is. The audio talks about the animals and their habitat which was interesting as I learnt a lot! The bus has no lights on it and the park only had lights on in the animals areas. This made it feel really cool! It was surprising how they just left the animals without any fences just stand there, being so calm. BRING BUG SPRAY! We all got bitten my mozzies! Good fun for the family!"
,,"The best safari experience I have had, especially at night!",5.0,,"This is an excellent experience.

I would advise to start with the cart tour and then take a wander around the grounds.

If possible, try to stay until the end when it is very quiet and the animals are more comfortable. We ended up being the last people wandering around the park and got to see some amazing animals and also the lions mating.

Might not be the safari for you if pictures are the most important thing, but if you value the experience it is excellent."
,,"Very busy and rushed, food expensive!",3.0,,I was really looking forward to this trip but was dissatisfied as the whole trip was a big rush. We saw the animal show which was cramped and we could hardly see. The tram ride was good if you liked to see 20 types of deer! The food was expensive and average at best. Overall I was disappointed.
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"Picked up from hotel by Tour East. Arrived at the Safari, taken to a priority lane for a tram around the park. Thought there could of been more animals, and bigger enclosures. Safari last 40 minutes or so. Food like all zoos over priced, $14 for a singapore tiger which i have never even paid that price for a corona at a casino"
,,Must do,5.0,,"Quite an amazing nighttime adventure perfect to do after the zoo. There are three things to do; a walk around the nocturnal animals where you get up close and personal, a tram ride around other animal areas, and the nighttime animal show, perfect for kids. Places to eat if you've come straight from the zoo. Totally recommended."
,,Great night,5.0,,"We arrived at the Night Safari with pre-purchased tickets. The booking agency fouled up our tickets and only sent codes for two tickets for a family of four.
 
The first girl at the desk tried to help but couldn't seem to do more than advise us to ring the booking agent, which I'd already done without success.
 
That combined with two hot bothered children and a long day was rapidly making the situation worse. My wife then asked to speak to somebody who could help.
 
Dhivyah was the lady who came to the rescue. In very quick order she had the tickets sorted out, ensured we went straight to the train without having to stand in the lines a second time and even arranged for our family to have seats at the night animal show.

Dhivyah took a night, that for us was rapidly turning more dreadful by the moment, and allowed us to have a fabulous night with our children in a wonderful venue.

I would highly recommend Night Safari to young and old alike!"
,,This is a Must,5.0,,The night safari is just awesome ...dinner then a train ride around the natural enclosures..only zoo I know of that doesn't use fences or cages but contains animals based on natural fear ie water (moats)
,,Great night tour,5.0,,Animals are awake at this time and therefore best to see at night. Guided tour on a large golf buggy where you can learn about each animal. Be wary of queues and book in advance!
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Me, my 7yo daughter and my 9m.o baby went here using SAEx shuttle bus that we catched from Orchard delfi bus stop. Cost me $11 for return for adult and $7 for my daughter return.
Good timing too as we arrived it was 7.30pm.
The thing was, that night Night safari was so so so busy in Saturday night Easter holiday period. Got the 8.15pm with the help of SAEx staff, and waited for a very long queue. One staff then said to us to see the Fire dance performance first which it was outside, and free.
After that show, another staff suggested us to go to River Safari (free that day) and come back on the line.
Guess what, when we arrived at 8.55pm, the 8.15 line was still there, with now lesser people.
But to wait again for the tram ride. It was a great experience, staff were able to manage properly the timing, tram, flow of people and attractions.
Due to the long hours of waiting, my daughter and baby was already sleepy and exhausted. We then did not have time for attraction and the walk.
We then took the 10.30pm bus back to Orchard rd."
,,Something special - highly recommended,5.0,,A very special experience which should not be missed. The tropical feeling with the animals close by in the quite night is very special and highly recommended. I enjoyed it very much!
,,Exciting Night-time Experience,5.0,,"Visited the Night Safari at approximately 7.30 p.m.
It's a very popular place to visit but I think we timed it right - the park was quiet and we were able to make the most of the time there.
A ride on the open-sided tram around the park took is on a journey through 7 of the world's geographical regions. From the Indian Subcontinent where majestic lions roam, to the Asian Riverine Forest that's home to the Malayan tapirs and magnificent Elephants. The 40 minute ride was enjoyable and you could see the animals in their enclosures - the lighting was dim and therefore the quality of the photographs are not perfect.
There are shops at the end of the trip where you can buy souvenirs, and there are a selection of places to eat.
Well worth a visit"
,,Very Crowded but Fascinating,4.0,,"We had tickets for the Night Safari which I think includes a show and a tram round the zoo, but they obviously sell more than they can take so we couldn't get in at the time we wanted to. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we went on a signposted walking route round all the animals and probably saw more, and definitely closer than the tram. Big emphasis on animals from Malaysia so some really interesting stuff, though I do worry about how much space the animals have.
Part of the deal was a meal after the show at an Indian restaurant in the zoo. This was very average and crowded and probably best avoided. I got a can of beer and it cost about £8!!"
,,Night safari,5.0,,"A MUST! We booked cheaper tickets through Klook app and it was so worth it! We got the tram ride at 7.15ish and then walked the trails.
The trails became much livelier as we walked round and the animals became much more alert. We ended up spending 2 hours on the trails because some of the animals were so fascinating to watch!
Adults and children alike would enjoy this but my feet did ache after the trails so wear comfy shoes!"
,,Unique experience,4.0,,We arrived at the night safari at 7:30pm after a 30min taxi ride from Sentosa (FYI- taxies charge an extra $20 after 5pm and the drivers don't tell you until you arrive at the destination!) There was already a long queue for the tram but it moved quickly. We remained on the tram for the entire 40min ride and saw many animals up close. Had our kids been older and not such early risers we would have taken advantage of the walking trails. Tip: get tickets for the show before getting on the tram- space is limited.
,,Come see people queuing,3.0,,"Nice idea but execution could do with some refinement. We did spend more time queuing than actually on the safari, which due to the volume of people was very much rushed affair with no reasonable stopping at each enclosure. All of this issues could be resolved by more effectively allocating viewing slots, which is a must given the limited capacity."
,,Singapore Zoo night safari,3.0,,"Very disappointing. We went on a guided tour, picked up from hotel at 5.30 so a very early start, and taken to central place to get on bus. Once we got out to the zoo we were guided into the complex and taken to the 'train station'. Was dark by the time we got on the train, this part was great as we were lucky to see all the animals on the trail and it did last for about 30 minutes. Back at the station we were taken to the arena where there is an animal show - this is terrible. A few small trained animals performed, it could have been a 20 minute show but drawn out by the staff to 40 minutes which resulted in people walking out! One couple only on our whole bus had chosen to include dinner in their tour so all the rest of us had to wait around for 40 minutes for them before we boarded the bus back to town so was a very late night arriving back at hotel at 10.30pm. Another time I would choose to do the Breakfast with Orangutans instead."
,,Enjoyed the Zoo,4.0,,"I visited the Zoo and booked the All 4 parks pass.
The main purpose of my visit was to see the pandas Kai-Kai and Jia-Jia and also do the night safari.
I was very pleased and it was a great time! The queue is amazing for the night safari so be ready to wait in queue for nearly an hour!"
,,Average one,2.0,,The park doesn't have much to see. To our disappointment it is heavily crowded and they didn't allow us to take a walk. The animals aren't much around. The park is very laid back and heavily overpriced for its value.
,,Unique Zoo experience!,4.0,,"When we arrived at night around 8ish, the place was packed - needless to say this is a very popular tourist attraction! The open concept is amazing and seeing animals be themselves in their nature habitat was great. Lighting is very dim so photos of animals may not come out as intended. Also get good seats on the tram ride, it'll make the experience worth while! When I visited, the visit seemed rush as we had to catch a bus ride on time to return to our hotel however this place should also be explored on foot on their different walking trails. The fire show at 10pm was great - this displayed talented performers with cool stunts."
,,Don't follow the crowds,2.0,,"Nothing I write here will stop hundreds of people visiting this attraction nightly. Having read previous reviews re transport to the Night Safari, we decided on cabs...37 SGD there (peak hour), 23 SGD back. The attraction is overcrowded, the safari train Harvey stops for photo opportunities, the wild animal show is pretty pathetic and the fast food outlets outside the site are average at best (barely passable curry was our choice). Do yourself a favour and stay in the city rather than indulge in this tosh."
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,The night safari was a wonderful experience... U can walk around in the park or catch a tram..try to check in at 7.15 entry. U get more time to stay n move around... The deer n other few animals r set free n they come across ur path easily.
,,"Unique, but not unforgettable",3.0,,"Night safari is like the zoo, largely on foot. It's dark and hard to navigate. Forget about taking pictures. It was unique and probably good for groups or families with children in strollers or over the age of 7. You'd have to keep kids close because lighting is poor, which is probably why this activity is so unique and exciting. In the right settings, this could be memorable, but solo or with a small group, it might only be memorable because you got lost."
,,Utter chaos!,1.0,,I booked a flexi ticket to visit the zoo with my 7 year old son. We arrived tonight just after 7pm to be told that we could not enter until 9:15pm as it was so busy. Why are the visits so restricted and unflexible when you have a flexi ticket. My son did not enjoy his visit as he was so tired once we got in! I will not visit again and do not recommend this attraction at all!
,,A different experience in a zoo,5.0,,"One of best zoo I have been to. The conditions of the animals are really decent. The selection of animals is really interesting (mainly based on Asian species). The concept is really great (seeing animals having different activities than during the day) and really well done (not much human disturbances, low lights, etc..). The activities such as the animal show and the tram are both a lot of fun and really educative. Highly recommend!"
,,Interesting concept,4.0,,"Watching wild life in their time zone instead of our time zone is a novel concept. However there are many practical issues like lighting,proximity to the animals,safety etc. that need careful attention . The management has tried addressing all these issue in the best manner possible and have done a good job .

With low key lighting the visibility is limited and there is nothing much one can see with any clarity . However the thrill of being in the presence of wild life in their domain was exciting.

The commentary was good,informative and presented well but as expected the lighting was low key. Admirable for the animals and a strain on the human eyes.

During the tram ride one may hop off at certain stations to take a walk in the jungle. We continued with the tram ride because we had come here as a family with members of different age groups.Able bodies individuals would find the walk more exciting than just the tram ride.

We had a very short wait period when we entered the place at opening time but as we were leaving I noticed there was a surging crowd and a long queue at the entrance. Turn up early to avoid waiting in long queues

Despite repeated requests by the tram conductor not to use flash photography there were many who continued to use flash with impunity. One would be well advised to switch off the flash on their cameras and mobile phones to avoid being a source of nuisance to both the animals as well as fellow tourists."
,,Children will definitely enjoy,4.0,,"The tram ride that you get at the Night Safari is very informative and kind of educational specially for children. Since there is alot of tourism in Singapore , it will have long ques but dont worry. must see for tourists"
,,Don't miss this nature night experience,5.0,,"We were happy to have booked it via a travel agency, this saved us from long queues to get on the trams.
Had booked it with dinner, but the buffet was not of any value, food was below standard.
Tram ride through the night was really worth it, lots of wildlife to see, maybe even better to do the walk in the park to get an even better experience.
The show at the end could be skipped, this was below average."
,,Decent tour,3.0,,"It was kind of alright. We hail from India and have seen many zoo and National parks. The night safari concept is great. It however was not something extraordinary. I believe I had very high expectations. If you are traveling with kids, you should visit it. For couples, there isn't much. Also most of the animals are from Indian subcontinent so nothing new for us. The ride back home on the HIPPO open air bus was fun."
,,Nice thing to do after the River safari,4.0,,We didn't walk round as we'd spent the afternoon at River Safari and had also been to Clarke quay but the train ride was fun and the views were great into each enclosure. Loads of places to get really good food there too....
,,safari feel .,5.0,,"this night safari feels very genuine ,arriving at the zoo I could tell that it was very popular the queue was extremely long yet was always seeming to move ,the wait was well worth it .the animals were walking freely through the zoo, obviously the more fierce animals were,nt ,that were still visible behind motes and other means than steel bars ,absolute fantastic zoo which should be modelled around the world .if given a choice over a day trip or night safari I would choose the night safari you won't be disappointed ."
,,WOW Must do!,5.0,,"Fabulous. I suggest do the Creatures of the Night show at 7.30, then WALK through the park as the line up for the tram is enormous. We returned to the tram line about 9.30 and lined up for only 5 minutes. Definitely do both walk through and tram ride. We caught a taxi there and back. Taxis are cheap."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Oh my goodness what a magical setting no concrete cages here.Well done Singapore. We had to queue but got through with the exception effort Singapore offers. Was it worth it ,every cent as you wind your way around looking at beautiful animals you only see on David Attenborough program. We saw white lion and lioness looking like poster for Lion King .It took effort not to sing Circle of life. My grandaughter was living her dream .We saw so many animals your favourite is sure to be among them.Dont miss this experience."
,,Animals at night is a good experience,5.0,,If you visit Singapore than Night Safari is a must watch. See the wild life in jungle live is a life time experience.
,,OK but there are better places to visit for the money,3.0,,"Nice enough, though quite a short ride on the safari train. You can however, walk through the park on foot after the ride which is good."
,,Great Place,5.0,,"We combined our visit to the Night safari along with River safari. We saw the River safari during the day then had food at the foodcourt and then headed to the Night safari. Being the peak season of last week in December, it was very crowded.

You have to book slots in advance ant tickets may not be available at the last moment especially during the holidays.

We travelled by SAEx bus - which goes direct from Little India Arcade Singapore Zoo / Night Safari. It was convenient"
,,Visit to night safari in Mar 2017,4.0,,"Was there on Wednesday during the Mar school holiday.
There are tourist crowds and need to wait in queue the watch the only show of the night, so be there at least 30 mins before the show start. We enjoy the tram ride and when for the Wallaby side walk which is new and interesting. Do expect not to see all the animals."
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,"We loved this. Although it was a bit busy and chaotic getting sorted. Onve on the tram and doing the trip it was excellent. Most animals we out. Some free to roam and other in exibits. Also because it is night, some animals are hard to see, make this part of your adventure. We then did the walking trails, also great. Less busy and can do at leisure."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Place is awesome We visited at 9pm
They take u on a tram to see animals that was really nice and after that there was a show that was really awesome The host in the show is a girl who speaks all the languages that i really like I will never forget that charming girl
After that we see fire show that was also okk
Must visit good experience something different"
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"How is it that I'm Singaporean and yet it took me 20-odd years to visit the Night Safari? I actually enjoyed it, especially the tram ride, where you get to see the animals up close and feel the cool breeze of the night against your face. Love the informative commentary that feeds you with interesting nuggets along the ride."
,,Excellent for night out,5.0,,"Good for a trip with family, friends Children can enjoy by seeing animals at a near distance Must for tourist"
,,Best Attraction of Singapore,5.0,,"""Creatures of the night"" show was very good. Take a tram to get an insight of the safari at night. Spot the animals in night when they are the most active. Also do take the walking trails.

Tip: If you are going to visit zoo, night safari, river safari and jurong park, take 4 in one pass and save around 70 SGD. I got if from the airport however they were available at parks as well.

Try doing zoo, river safari and night safari on the same day as these attractions are far away from the city and very close to each other."
,,Not the real thing,3.0,,"If you have ever been to Africa on a real safari you might be slightly disappointed. Here you are guaranteed to see plenty of animals but in their enclosures apart from some antelopes and tapirs that roam freely. We had everything booked ahead time and thus did not have to wait anywhere. The show ""creatures of the night"" is rather for kids though"
,,Meh.,2.0,,"High expectations probably didn't help our visit. Quite a long wait for the 'Creatures Of The Night' presentation was rewarded with 6 fairly bored-looking animals - presenter did his best with limited material before the real reason for going - the tram ride.
Half the animals (at least the visible ones) were asleep or looked like they were quite bored of their surroundings. Worryingly, some of them didn't really look in the best condition either and neither did their quite sparse 'areas'. Some nicer areas, but the whole thing felt a bit like a way to get people in - ""It's a bit hot to spend a day at the zoo, so we'll get them in at night when it's a bit cooler"".
One of the signs said ""The first - and only - safari of its kind"". There's a very good reason. Save your money and donate it to an animal charity - you'll feel better about yourself all things considered."
,,Subpar Visit to the Zoo at Night,2.0,,"This is a great zoo, if you like zoos. But you get more going during the day than you do at night.

The night safari is basically an opportunity to walk/tram through the zoo after sunset to see the animals that are up and around at night. BUT most animals are up and around during the day where you can really see them and enjoy their activity. Strolling, hanging out, and taking your time is definitely more conducive during the day than at night.

This was our second trip to the Night Safari for the kids but seriously wished we saved the money."
,,An unexpectedly good experience,4.0,,"Went on the Night Safari on an impulse. Took longer to get there by public transport than I thought it would (peak hour), but a relatively straightforward trip by train and bus. Place seemed super busy at the entrance and advice was to go to the Creatures of the Night show first rather than joining a long line to wait for the trams. Good advice and glad I followed it. Night creatures show was interesting and nicely staged to appeal to a wide audience - not too long either. Went straight from there onto a Safari Tram which follows a set route around key sites that let people see a range of nocturnal animals from Africa and Asia. Takes about forty minutes and the taped commentary is well-timed and informative. I'd had a long day so called it quits at that point, but there are a number of other features such as four trails that let people walk around other animal exhibits on their own (would do this if I visited again) or various other experiences. Staff are lovely and helpful and the whole place is well-structured and organised. Recommend this particularly to families with children (have an afternoon nap so you can enjoy the whole experience). Plenty of travel options back to the downtown city area and taxis abound if you can't face the late-night buses and trains. I wasn't sure about the night safari at first, but I actually enjoyed my time there and recommend it."
,,Amazing night safari,5.0,,We were a bit skeptical about the night safari but wanted to give it a try and it was SO worth the wait! There is something special and magical to walk in the dark and see the animals more relaxed than during the day. Will certainly do it again next time in Singapore.
,,"Excellent, but.........",4.0,,"My wife and I loved seeing all the animals from a close proximity you wouldn't get as a regular daytime visitor, and enjoyed our visit. However, you can't help but feel like you only get such brilliant views of the animals (by which I mean they are almost invariably on display in exactly the right places) because the living space they have is so ridiculously small that they have no-where else to go.
The tour is completely choreographed, and the animals appear as per the recorded narration around every bend. Why on earth would they be there if they had literally anywhere else they could go, to avoid being gawped at by the constant (and I do mean constant) stream of open buses coming past with loudspeakers describing them?
Good for kids, but I left feeling sorry for the poor confined creatures."
,,not worth it,1.0,,"every body was talking about this place, and thought its a must see.
We booked for the 8:30 pm slot, arrived there around 7:45 pm. the queues were horrendous. very slow moving and lots of people cutting in and being encouraged by staff. We forgot all the pain and irritation once we got in the tram. But this was the biggest disappointment. It was actually hard to see some of the animals... which was the whole purpose of the visit.The place it not worth a visit and would not recommend it."
,,Nothing exciting,3.0,,Disappointed with this place. Nothing excited or much to shout about. Rather spend the time at the Zoo.
,,Birthday trip,5.0,,Night Safari are different from the normal zoo as it operates at evening time where you get to see how the animals behave during night time. The tram ride is great but be prepared for the long queue. Do visit early so that you will have ample time to include watching the shows and sight seeing through walking around the park.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"We have been to the Night Safari and really enjoyed it. It is very popular (at least on sundays), so be there early to be able to start at 19.15 at sunset. The tram is nice but in my opinion, the stops in front of the animals are too short, you can only have a short view. The highlight for me were the walking trails with animals rarely seen as the tarsier, the pangolin, the mouse deers, the flying foxes, the slow loris, the giant flying squirrels or the palm civets. We did not attend the live show.
To get home, I recommend the SAEX coaches, which cost $6."
,,World's only and the Best!,5.0,,"Trust me, is saw a Lion barely feels away from me, unprotected and then a deer just on the opposite. It made me wonder how not the Lion ate the Dear. That's the beauty. Here the beasts are not chained. They Rome about in the open and you can see them from up close.

Take the the tour bus for a splendid tour and also walk the path into the jungle for a deeper view!"
,,Singapore's Nocturnal Zoo,5.0,,"The Night Safari is located at the Singapore Zoo in the north of the Island where you can enjoy seeing the ""Nocturnal Animals"" active after dark."
,,Safariiing,5.0,,Except for the long queues and long waiting hours the place is a wonder land with all lightings perfectly set show casing the animals. Best suited for a night out with family. The tram experience is quite amazing.
,,Visitors on an industrial scale,3.0,,There is nothing small and personal about this. Huge numbers of people so if you hate crowds not for you. That said legendary Singapore efficiency comes into play so they do make it work despite the huge crowds. Our kids (4 and 6) loved the tram ride around the park seeing the animals and the show was entertaining. Just be prepared to queue.
,,It is well done,4.0,,"Went there recently with an elderly parent and the tram ride was a good way of experiencing the park. It's all very well done though the queue to get to the tram was long - we waited 45 minutes on a Friday night. The attendants are very helpful. There are plenty of dining options, and good souvenir shops too. If you are able to walk then walking the park rather than the tram would be a better idea."
,,Nice place for kids. New Dinosaur Park and water park,5.0,,Best place to visit with family and kids. Dinosaur Park and water park. Visited two times in a year so far. Night safari and river safari is good.
,,A Wonderful Experience To View The Nocturnal Animal At Night,5.0,,A wonderful experience to view the nocturnal animals at night. Tram available for the less mobile visitors.
,,Night Safari a must,5.0,,"The night safari is what sets this zoo apart. You will have time to watch an animal show (worth while), get on the tram ride, and walk around. I suggest not getting on the tram ride straight away as the queues for it are long initially. See the animal show first and the tram queues will likely be gone. You will still have time to walk the walking trails after that. Make sure you bring and use mosquito repellant!"
,,Interesting & informative,3.0,,There were a LOT of people queuing up for this at 7pm on a mid week night & I wondered what we'd actually see but it proved to be a winner. Seems animals are fed close to tram tracks so are visible in their environments which show no signs of fences but there must be to keep lions & tigers from antelope etc. The pangulan & otter keeper was keenly interested in his charges & his enthusiasm was charmingly engaging with the children.
,,So recommended...,4.0,,"Up close and personal at night on cars driven around the park, close to a multitude of animals..safely.. we loved it. Great with a couple of teenagers as well.."
,,Great fun but requires some planning,4.0,,"Went there on a weekend and did not expect such a large crowd. For first time visitors, do note that admission is based on timing. You have to get tickets for admission at a particular timing. If the 1915 tickets are sold out, then you will have to get the 2015 tickets and so on. Although there were many people, the place was very well managed and the wait times for boarding the teams were not too long. Overall, it was a nice experience."
,,Night safari,4.0,,Recommend this to anyone who loves animals. The animals seem so close and you get to see them at night.
,,Night at the Zoo,5.0,,"This you have to do, the animals come alive at night time and there's something about tge night and the lights that turn this experience into wonderment. You actually feel like your in another world. The stalls and the food is amazing too. The staff are very friendly. It's a great way to finish the day"
,,Nice idea but too noisy and busy!,3.0,,"The idea is good but so many people making a lot of noise and nobody controlling it!
Not enough time to see the animals as the tram is too quick .
Not sure the animals have a lot of space for themselves.
And the silly shows etc... make it cheesy!
Not really worth the time and money considering it's a way out of time"
,,An amazing way to see the Zoo,5.0,,"After the heat of the day the night safari is a perfect way to walk through the zoo and see the animals. The zoo is immaculate and very well organised and whilst I am not a huge fan of keeping animals in captivity the zoos ethos and wildlife protection programme seem to validate its existence - I think! The rescuers tiger is amazing.

Well run, clean and well worth a visit."
,,"If you have the time, buy the 4 park ticket !",4.0,,"we bought the 4 park ticket which meant we could visit 4 parks for the price of 2, but only had time for 3, so very happy. This was one of them and very enjoyable."
,,Enjoyable but not a must do,3.0,,We enjoyed our night at the zoo and saw a lot of animals but it wasn't overly memorable and I wouldn't classify it as an unmissable experience while in Singapore.
,,Night safari,4.0,,"Very good trip well organised, with fastrack to the trams which take you on your safari trip. Our trip had buffet meal included which was good with plenty choices. Animal show good and view of animals very good in natural habitat. Worth doing good value"
,,Wildife at night,5.0,,"Place and the concept is awesome . Night safari is really nice concept . There is train which takes u around to the jungle with live commentary . Train stops at various stations , u can walk around and cover some some spots . Nicely organized place . Must do ."
,,Night safari - an evening well spent in Singapore,4.0,,"Visited Singapore zoo for the night safari. It is an experience to stroll around the zoo during night, though you don't get to see too many animals. There is a show about nocturnal creatures, which is good too."
,,Night Safari was excellent if a little mobbed,5.0,,The night safari is excellent for young kids. A bit of walking is required to see some of the animals. Take insect repellant and leave early to get there; as we found out the entry point gets very busy and you'll be in the midst of rush hour traffic to get there unless you go later in the evening.
,,Same animals just in the dark!,3.0,,"Considering the time that you spend waiting and buying the tickets for this experience, I don't think it is worth it. It is a fun experience but for those who have been to the Night Safari in Thailand, that one is a lot better!

We had tickets for 7:15pm. We had to line up for entry at 6:30 and then line up again for the tram. Lots of lining up and it gets a bit hectic and crowded.

There are no interactions with the animals.

The animals are basically the same ones you see during the day (which is a lot clearer) in Singapore Zoo.

Wouldn't recommend it unless you didn't get a chance to see the singapore zoo in the daytime."
,,Very nice,5.0,,"A nice place where you can choose to walk or ride a tram to see the animals. The animals are not caged. It's really dark but you get to see the animals. The tram is of a good speed, where you can get to see all the animals and there is also an audio guide. There are also owls!

There are free shows provided, which you can view the showtimes on the brochures."
,,Over Rated,2.0,,Over rated is the word that comes to mind. Please skip it if you need to cut down on your trip to Singapore and go to Faber Peak instead. We are living in Kenya so yes we did find it like a fancy zoo but if it is animals you want to see then go to the SIngapore Zoo instead. This is just a waste of time and money.
,,Very nice tram safari,4.0,,I reserve the 5 star safari for the San Diego Safari Park. This night safari was very nice. It was just under an hour long. You have the option to get off half way through to walk some of the trails and then you can hop back on the rest of the way.
,,Nothing spectacular,3.0,,"I was expecting a lot more from this attraction. It was worth visiting but with young children you have to be prepared for a late night. It also happened to be particularly busy (on a Monday night) so be there by 6:45pm to wait in line. The tram ride was a unique experience but not spectacular. The night animals show is worth watching. Unlike other attractions in Singapore this one was not easy to navigate and not laid out well. Managing 3 kids and getting from the tram ride to the pyro show and then back to the night show was confusing. Overall, there are few items to see and do in a short time frame so plan it out well. Would recommend doing the 7:30pm night show and then getting on the tram."
,,"Night Safari is a must and Kids love it, even if you have seen dozens of Zoo's around the world!",5.0,,"Over the course of more than 10 year that I've lived in Singapore I brought just about every visitor from Europe to the Night Safari (even if there are many well kept Zoo's in i.e. Switzerland) but the Night Safari and the show (check the schedule right at the entrance to make sure you don't miss the fun filled event) are so different and great attraction. Spend the money to take the train ride across the Night Safari ""Zoo"" and come very close to animals feeding next to you. A MUST for families with kids. They will be excited about the mix of darkness and animals and adventure.

Go and enjoy!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,What an experience... really nice .. the day we visited Singapore we visited for night safari and seeing animals in the night is another great experience.. they have beautiful facilities of transportation.. when we went there we took metro then took bus & reached there after coming out around 10pm we found that Lots of private buses and cars are there and in very nominal charge they are giving facilities.. amazed ... inside first we saw a dance with fire & then a show with animals conducted by a little smart girl which was excellent and after that the tram journey mind blowing... just love it
,,Tram ride is a lifesaver. Creatures show is great!,4.0,,"Buy your tickets online in advance; prepare to queue for everything (entry to park, tram ride, creatures show); wear good shoes; bring water and snacks especially if you have small children. Lots of interesting animals to see, like bear-cats and otters, white raccoons and mousedeer. Rhinoceroses, elephants, tigers, lions, bears, giraffes, hyenas, and alligators among others also form part of the safari.

We saw the Creatures of the Night show (30 min) then took the 40-minute narrated tram ride around the park. With a tired cranky toddler, this was the best, as there was no way we would have been able to get the child to walk around as well.

It is a little depressing to be reminded at every turn that the wild animals are dying because of human greed and stupidity. Still, an important message, and conservation needs to be second nature to us if this planet is to have a future at all."
,,Nice experience to witness wildlife up close at night,4.0,,Overall it was an above average experience.... The tram track train takes you through the zoo at night time where you can witness a lot of wild animals up close and in my trip a deer happen to come very close by to the train.....tigers were caged in glass walls and lions were kept at bay by a small water channel......at the entrance one can witness tribal dance forms...so overall a must visit and nice experience..
,,Another Top Experience,5.0,,"We did the River Safari then this one. It is too much to do the zoo, river safari then night safari in one day. We booked online and chose the first session at 7.15PM so we were not back too late. The Creatures of the Night was our first stop....very good, then the safari which is like a small shuttle that runs around quite slowly. We expected to see glimpses of animals but you get great views because of the lighting used. Surprisingly good. You can also walk tracks if you have time which we didn't do due to tiring children!
PS taxi back to Novena was just over $20....a bit more to downtown."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"If you want to visit this place, you may want to consider the night safari. Be sure get there early as lines are super long during weekend. DO NOT forget mosquito repellent."
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,"Wonderful experience. All most all animals were visible during night. It has 2 shows, fire show one at the entrance and another one is animal show. Don't miss it !.
For Indian travellers: There is an indian restaurant also at the entrance. You can have dinner after the visit."
,,Simply superb!,5.0,,"Wonderful experience. Watch animals in their natural surrounds. Bit like a zoo, but without cages or enclosures. You sit in a train with open carriages and travel through a ""forest"" viewing animals on either side. There is sufficient lighting to see the animals clearly. The commentary assists in directing your attention to the attractions. Well planned activity lasting about 40 mins. Caution: be prepared to queue up for lengthy periods for your ride! Well worth the wait though. After the safari, one can visit the many food outlets and souvenir shops."
,,Good Experience at night with animals,4.0,,"This is safari park in which operation starts from evening to night. This is good for Kids, Live animals perform in the show. You can enjoy tram ride while watching live animals bring from throught out the world"
,,World class zoo,4.0,,"The shuttle bus tour is a particularly relaxing and informative way to view the animals that are kept in open and natural looking enclosures. We got to view all of the animals we were hoping to see including the big cats and bears. The only negatives were a lack of clear instructions on how to redeem entry tickets when you've booked online (you need to use the electronic kiosks by the entrance), there is also no easy public transport link which is a disappointment for such a major attraction."
,,Enjoyable but tram should linger longer,3.0,,"We enjoyed the novelty of safari and night and the animals are more active. I especially enjoyed watching the Hyena's. It's laid out and seems like the animals are free in the wild with a lot of space. It made it look like they were in natural settings.

I just thought that the Tram was too quick to pass the animals, it should have lingered a bit more. I'm not sure if this is done to process as many visitors as possible as the park was crowded. You could get off and walk but then would have to wait to get back on a tram, if it had space. Tram ride is approx 40 mins and the que to get on it is took us about an hour. It's a decent experience, you'll like it if you love animals. I wouldn't call this a must see or an excellent experience, but it was fun.

Sadly.. we didn't get to see the Hippo. Didn't he know I was coming! ... (see my username for the joke)"
,,Loved it. (Not necessary to book a tour you can do it yourself),5.0,,"This was right at the top of our ""must do"" list for Singapore and quite rightly. We opted not to book a ""tour"" that included transport but booked our own tickets (really easy via their website) - we had planned on using public transport but our hotel told us it was quicker and only a few dollars more to just take a cab which we did. We arrived too early for our tour and rather that eat at one of the fast food outlets opted for the more expensive buffet restaurant which was an excellent choice - delicious food.

We then entered the main park at our ticket time and within a few minutes were on a tram on our safari. Yes it is a bit false (like most of Singapore) but you are in the middle of a city and are not really going to see animals roaming wild like on a real safari - still an excellent experience. We found some of the walking trails a little confusing and started on one and finished on another (that we thought was quite a distance away) - but the whole evening was thoroughly enjoyable and we are delighted we did it"
,,Disappointed. Over-priced and didn't see much.,2.0,,People raved about this but I must say I was very disappointed. We did the famous night tour here but we couldn't really see many animals. It costs a fortune for a pretty dissapointing experience. The show afterwards was ordinary as well. It wasn't un-enjoyable but it was definitely not what we expected. Not a highlight of Singapore. As well as that the cages for the animals were much smaller than other zoo's like Melbourne zoo.
,,A night with animal and the wild life,5.0,,"Asia's best safari, the night safari. Here you can explore many animals from very close. I love the show which were presented just before enter the safari. This Safari is for all ages people and it is way how you can go close to the animal. They kept the animal who are very rare and who are almost out of the world. Don't miss this when you are in SIngapore."
,,No longer a novelty,1.0,,"Messy, tiny, crowded place. It was a novelty when first opened. But it is so commercialised now. And for tourists if you buy tickets form certain travel agents you can get priority treatment. You can jump queue! Hmmm... Creature of the night show is for kids.. though a good place to enjoy a 20 min. of rest and some good jokes.. if you missed it, fret not.. enjoy the narrow walking trails if you can spot the nocturnal animals. Though I must say the 40 min. tram ride is still unique.. oh well after you queued for so long you need to sit down and rest a bit.. enjoy some quietness and tranquility. For visitors if you are looking for night tours watch the marina bay sands or gardens by the bay laser light shows.. they are awesome and best of all it's free!"
,,"Great rainforest, ok animals, night walkways are cool, train is a bit boring",3.0,,"We went on the tram-ride through the zoo and it was nice to have the description of the animals, but it went by too slowly in general and too fast past the animals. The types of animals are interesting, but not as plentiful as in many European zoos. It can be interesting that they are often running free when you drive through the ""caged"" in areas. That is if they are awake! Many were sleeping. The only animal behind glass was the tiger. Might be more interesting if you have limited zoo experience, but if you have seen many zoos this might not be the best."
,,Night Zoo Takes You An Hour - 一小時行程的夜間動物園,3.0,,"To come here takes us one hour from downtown and it took us around an hour to finish everything here. It is still worth to come because we rarely visit a zoo at night & you can see some of them first time at night - namely hippo, rhino, tiger, bear, giraffe, lion, deer and some others. I found most of the visitors took the tram ride like us which is roughly around 40 minutes. We watched a fire show in the front gate & there was an animal show in the end.
花了一小時到這裡，我們也花了一小時看完這裡；還是值得一來，因為我們很少會在晚上造訪動物園，也多是第一次在黑夜中看到河馬、老虎、獅子、黑熊、長頸鹿以及擦身而過的馬來貘！大部分遊客都坐導覽車遊園，大約是40分鐘，我們也在入口處見到了火焰秀，行程最後也有動物秀可觀賞。"
,,Close Encounters,5.0,,"When in Singapore a definite stop for everyone. Walk amongst elephants, lions, flying squirrels and bats. What experience especially with kids. Do not miss it."
,,Animals at their best.,4.0,,"By the time we entered the park we were exhausted. Do not do the Singapore Zoo, River Safari and the Night Zoo all in one day.
We had pre bought tickets but had to wait over 30 minutes to enter the park. The lines to get in were crazy. We went on a week night thinking there would be less people.
The animal show was worth watching. It was interesting and informative. A great place to take kids.
We were only centimetres away from a tiger. Only the glass saving is from being eaton. The animals were in natural like settings. It meant that they were happy.
.The only let down was the food. Eat before going to the Zoo. The Zebra cafe was only selling drinks as the machines had broken down. The lines for the other food vendors were long. It was a good Zoo to visit."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"We visited during th day then got a shuttle bus back from the hotel for the Night Safari. We saw a fire show than a show entitled Creatures of the Night which was very good with plenty
of seating. After this we took a tram round the Zoo to see the
animals at night. This was very good, animals not at all
disturbed by the tram and saw animals we didn't see during our day visit."
,,A night out with a difference,5.0,,"A great night had for all ages. Families, groups and couples will enjoy this attraction. The Night Safari is still a Zoo but seeing it at night gives it another dimension of novelty. Get there early. Have a look around at the souvenir shops and get dinner and queue in line for the first safari tour at 7:15. If you are able do the Trail walks. They allow you to get up and personal with some of the creatures.

A great night for our group of 11 pax ages 19-35 years old."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,So wonderful to see the nocturnal animals. Very different animals than I have seen at other zoos. Especially the snow lion....white lion. We had a 9$ uber ride after a long metro ride because we wanted to avoid the traffic jam.
,,Ok concept for a zoo,3.0,,"Was quite underwhelmed since I have been to many better zoos . We did like the concept of taking a tram to visit the zoo at night, but frankly, the night visit is supposed to be more lively for the nocturnal animals. But they didn't appear that much different than at other zoos I have visited in daylight. $45 per person for the night tour is reasonable (Sing. $)."
,,"In the end, still a zoo",4.0,,"Must see? Not sure, in the end it's still a zoo. It was part of our tour and I'm not upset we went, but... We did have a lot of fun and the tour included the dinner buffet and that was very good. Thumbs up."
,,it should be a new experience for a first timer..,4.0,,"Few points that first timers need to know..
1. On rainy days, you can change your booking.They would ask you to write an e-mail and keep that e-mail handy.
2. Go early, preferably the first slot so that you can spend good time there.. Apart from Tram rides, there are walking trails in the safari, which by themselves are quiet interesting for the first timers.
3. You can watch few animals in the dark and also try to go in the respective feeding times (like Tiger feeding time at 9 PM if I remember right)."
,,Great to walk around at night and see the animals,4.0,,"It seems that everyone has the same timed ticket of 7.15pm and it was chaotic to start with as everyone started to queue up and then once through the ticket barrier it wasn't very well organised in terms of where you should be going etc. We didn't have a map and would recommend you have one. If you can delay going in until after 8pm it is much quieter and more civilised. There seemed to be 3 options, go and see the creatures of the night, get on one of the trams (different languages supported) or walk around yourself. We opted for the creatures of the night, then jumped on the tram and then once we came back round got off and walked around a section of the safari. It was lovely to see the animals of a night time and once the mad rush was over it was really very pleasant walking around. We both enjoyed this Night Safari and seeing lots of animals."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"A great experience seeing a wide range of animals normally hidden away in normal zoos because they are at least partially nocturnal. The tram ride and the walking trails don't have a lot of overlap, so you should do both - the gradient is fairly easy. The only drawbacks are the distance from the city and the crowds for the Creatures of the Night show, which is missable."
,,Great Night Zoo,5.0,,"We had a fun time taking the Night Zoo tram ride. All the animals were out. Hippos, rhinos, bears oh my. It was a nice event to attend after our business meeting."
,,Very interesting at night,4.0,,"This was an interesting experience to see the animals at night, also a lovely atmosphere riding around in the train in the cool of the undergrowth."
,,"Is it worth a visit, not sure",3.0,,"Was expecting a bit more really. the tram ride was okay but was hard to see any of the animals due to the lack of light, now I realise it is a night safari but it is quite difficult to see the animals and the tram fair whizzes round so don't get too long to see the animals. There are a couple of average shows on offer. At the start it is a bit of stampede so would recommend going later if you can, will see everything in 2-3 hrs."
,,Great Safari Park,4.0,,"I have to admit that I've seen and photographed night safari , however I felt very safe here as well as most of the animals felt happy , I would love to go again , its just a different feeling to photograph at night

Love it"
,,Biggest disappointed,2.0,,"When we boarded the bus to visit this place, our guide went Gaga over the place which resulted in high built up and this is the reason it disappoints you big time.
In the night safari they throw orange light at the living places of these animals who are not even nocturnal and you try to search where the animal is from the passing bus. At times you are successful but mostly you are not. So you end staring in the dark and seeing nothing.
So, my suggestion would be to use your time better at some other place. Because even the food offered is not so great and tribal dance shown is degraded version of what we see in India. The show covered with animals performance is also just ok.

My recommendation is to use your valuable money in something better because tickets are not cheap."
,,Amazing to see the animals active at night,5.0,,"This was well worth the late night, we walked the three trails first to avoid having to stand in the very long (but orderly) queue for the trams, the zoo keepers were great and we even got the chance to feed the otters and porcipine, which the 5yr old loved. By the time we finished walking the trails we were able to get straight on the tram and heaps of room for each of us on the bench seats on the tram. It was a late night, but wouldn't have missed it. We booked online, entrance time is staggered, so book early so you can get the first entrance time (7.30pm I think) We got in at 8.15 and left at around 11pm."
,,Gd exp,4.0,,"Gd place to learn about night animals. Just next to the zoo so this can be an after dinner walk. Unless you have very good cameras, dont bother about photos here. Strictly no flash allowed as it will harm the animals' eyes."
,,excellant plkace to be seen,5.0,,nice journey excellant ambience nice ambience excellent tour nice announcements greenary you can fee that you are with animals
,,The best of the three zoos,5.0,,"So Sg has a river safari, zoo and night safari.

All going thru pratically the same space with slight variations (river safari - Panda/ night safari - nocturnals)

Of all three, I always enjoy coming to the night safari.

Somehow the entire setup makes it look so close/ real.

You get to see the animals pretty much upclose except that you are in a tram.

Given the timing, it's not hot and you get to roam about a bit or take multiple turns in the tram.

Although a little tight time wise, I find this zoo one of the best I've been too.

Go there and see it for yourself.

Minus point: food can be expensive/over priced and transportation after 12am is limited."
,,Too crowded for comfort,3.0,,We visited at the weekend and the crowds were overwhelming. We were on an organised trip therefore avoided many of the queues but still the amount of people there was rather daunting. The actual safari ride was good although spoilt by some people ignoring the instruction not to use flash photography.
,,must see,5.0,,Its a great place to visite...............any day but I would say take the night safarie as most animales there night active.............
,,All 3 in one day makes you very tired by this time,4.0,,"Yeah, this was very good although we did the Zoo and River safari first in the same day. You have to be organised but is doable and you can see most things, but is a long long day. Weigh up if coming back on a second day is worth it.

Night Safari - well, book early slot as you queue and everyone else is there at same time - then cue mad rush for the road train (Or show if you prefer). These are the main two things to do and you do see a number of animals on the journey. Photo opportunities are limited unless you are a briliant photographer due to darkness and movement.

You will have seen most of the animals before if you have been around the other two parks

Show was ok too. What we missed was the walks through the park, so cannot comment on how good they may be"
,,Very slick organisation and experience,4.0,,"I'd bigged this up with my wife and daughter having gone 20 years ago and we were excited to finally get here...the tram ride is super organised...as my wife pointed out the Singaporean's like their OCD rather more CDO in proper alphabetic order! No queue jumping aloud...marvelous!

I bought tickets online saving 10% on a combo with the river safari (even better)...so worth doing...the two together were fantastic value at £40 an adult and £30 a child

Its always hit and miss in regards animals at the zoo but we saw the lions, tiger, elephants and giraffes and a host of other bongo style carnivore fodder inches from the tram

Well recommended..as you can say you walked through the rainforest..."
,,take your time,5.0,,"very crowded, it would be best if you avoided the trams, and walked on the various trails. give at least two hours so you dont miss out on the animals. Same as the zoo but a different take in the nightime."
,,Last minute dash to Night Safari,3.0,,"We went for the Night Safari my family 2 adults 3 kids with my brother 2 adults 1 toddler.
Pros
A) Animals condition are waayyy much better then where I come from. They look active and yes like animals... some commented that few animals cannot be seen but hey... its nocturnal anyway so some you see and some you don't. So for me its fine as my kids got to see lions and tigers enjoying their dinner. Thats a plus
B) Crowd control was fantastic . We went for 815pm ride and the crowds was building up. Ut kudos to night safari team although its a fair bit of waiting but you do see they have a system in place. Cant blame them since its a tourist place

Cons
A) We went for a trail walk and finally got lost inside whereas its 10pm... searched for a tram to ride back but theres none. Luckily kids are still active and dont mind the walk. So point to note always be aware of the walking you're doing if its trail walk

I gave it a three star since once we're done with the tram n trail walk. Nothing much to be done. The show for animals also finished quite fast so if have multiple shows will be great to accommodate late comers"
,,Waste of time,2.0,,Heaps of people waiting in line. Difficult to spot any animals as the light is so low. All you can see are shapes in the distance.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari and river safari, the river cruise is only 15 mins but it was good going through collection of fish on your way to the boat. Night Safari was very good but really large cues either tho you have a booking you still have to line up so do it early. Great seeing the animals in their own habitats."
,,A Zoo by night,5.0,,"We have alteady been 3 times, with kids, no kids. It's a beautiful jounrey by night through the animals world, nicely hidden, nicely illuminated and still natural"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Night safari is little overhyped , However , worth exploring the charm of the night safari is the show that happens , very well done . The way animals come and perform also the host of the show it is quite entertaining"
,,A little underwhelming !,2.0,,"The trip got off to a bad start as we were delayed leaving the pick
Up point .
It was very useful being on an organised trip as we were able to skip the lines and get onto the tram
It wasn't in any way exciting !
Even when we got off at the stop to walk around and see the lions
We didn't actually see anything different than we had seen on the tram!
Perhaps visiting the zoo would be a better option
Don't think you would have missed anything if you hadn't managed to fit in this night safari"
,,Great,5.0,,"This was very cool. All the animals you usually don't see at zoos because they're sleeping or hiding are out and about making themselves heard. Give yourself plenty of time to visit. Take the tram around the park first so you can see where you want to go, it is free."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Designed to flow the visitors thru. I recommend to do the walking options as most people will line up for the train ride and therefore you get to enjoy some areas with very few people, therefore animals are more available to see!"
,,Good if it doesn't rain,3.0,,"I did this trip on a tour unfortunately it absolutley poured with thunder and lightning and we only just started on the Night Train when they cancelled the tour and we had tor return to the main entrance, didn't get to see any animals and as there was so much rain everyone was ordered to go to there buses and go home, Most of the food shops had shut up as there was so much rain the ground was flooded, very disappointed and no refund or discount was offered for another trip, My recommendation is take a umbrella, poncho no matter what,a drink,and snacks if possible as the food wasn't cheap and good shoes and camera of course and hopefully you will be lucky enough to see some animals"
,,Great,4.0,,"Very informative. We used the tram rather than walking as we did the zoo the same day and were wrecked.

Unfortunately the tram doeant come to a complete halt for photos, meaning most photos come out blurry due to the lack of light, even on decent gear.

Saw many animals, and am very glad we waited around d to get it done. Get their early, as the crowds are huge, but they do get you through very quickly, and provide entertainment while you are lined up.

Food and beverages in the area looked excellent."
,,Enjoyable Night Safari,5.0,,"It's well known that many animals sleep during the day and hunt at night. So the Night Safari is a true experience for anyone who loves animals. I prefer the Zoo by day, but the Night Safari is also well worth doing."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,We only had a few hours in Singapore and managed to make our way to the Night Safari (a bit tricky from the airport but can be done with the help of a tour bus transfer). What an incredible experience! The tram ride was superb - we couldn't believe how close we were to the animals. Would absolutely recommend. Especially if you have little ones you need to entertain.
,,Zoo,5.0,,We loved the Zoo and would go back again. Having breakfast with the Orangatangs was magnificent. The night Safari was fabulous it was wonderful to see the animals not caged.
,,"Terrible trip in Singapore, totally waste of money",1.0,,"Don't go for the night safari. First, you can't see anything because it's too dark. =.= Also, the staffs there are so rude. Bad customer service. Bad experience in Singapore. Totally waste of money."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"We came on a Friday night for the 8:15 PM entrance. Started the q at 7:45.
To avoid the crowd we have started with the animals of the night show then the trails walabi and Leopard. After all of this it was 23:00 when we arrived at tram station: no q and we have seen almost every animals :)"
,,Lives up to the hype,5.0,,"Great experience. Tram ride through landscapes, opportunity to see fantastic animals with a tour guide who was not only informative but an advocate for the environment. The animals are magnificent. Fantastic experience for families. If you're in Singapore, this is a must-see."
,,Touristy but good,4.0,,"We arrived in time for our slot and had to wait in a long queue for entry. At this point it all seemed a bit theme parkish as people edged forward to get through the gates and then queue for the trams. We decided to head for the animal show that was about to start and then to head back for the trams after. This seemed to work but probably mainly because we sat at the back of the show and so were first out and into the tram queue after the show.

The show itself is really for small children but was reasonably enjoyable. The tram ride which visits the various animal enclosures was OK but for the small number of inconsiderate people who insist on using their mobile phones with the flash bulbs on (you are asked not to do this by staff for the wellbeing of the animals at the start of your trip).

The best part for me was walking the four trails that take you to see the animals on much closer basis.

We took a taxi from the centre of Singapore and back and the average cost was about 30SGD each way."
,,thrill at best,5.0,,"best try to get earlier as it has some big queue ,find front seats in tram ,and you will experience the best ,staffs are good and restaurants also good ,great time spent"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,A good place to visit once if your in Singapore. Well organise and managed zoo.. kids will enjoy it.. worth a shot
,,very unique experience,5.0,,"Singapore zoos are the top zoos in asia, both the Singapore zoo and the night Safari. I always go to zoo no matter where i travel. and this one is def one of my fav and i remember the experience very well even after almost two years. it's unique, with unique animals, and the zoo is doing a really good job for enrichment."
,,Night safari in the zoo was okie,3.0,,"The zoo is a just about like the zoos visited in India. I did not find it Wow! As we had taken night safari, the feel was good.
Honestly, you can avoid this one if you have been to some of the good zoos in India."
,,Knightangle,5.0,,Start to end it has been a journey out here. The fire show then the ride to see the animals is a treat.
,,Never been this close to animals at night,4.0,,"As a tourist, felt this idea very interesting..To find the animals in their natural habitat. A few who came along found it Artificial since the animals stay still. But its definitely a Must if you're visiting Singapore."
,,Use your legs - don't just sit on the tram.,5.0,,"Excellent, but you must get off at he tram stops and walk to each of the zones. We got up close to animals on most of the exhibits. The open enclosures like the bats - we were inches away from feeding animals. Saw slow loris, binturong, cloud leopard, civets, sugar gliders, jaguar, possum...all active at night.
The tram will only go past large exhibits and take in the larger nocturnal mammals, like tapir, hyena and so on - so you might miss the smaller gems.
Again, be prepared to walk some distance but it is worth it."
,,A fantastic variation on a zoo visit,5.0,,"Booked with tour East Singapore Picked up from hotel for assembly and allocation in China Town. Poorly organised and chaotic as hundreds of people had to be allocated to different evening tours. Eventually organised and had a great guide in CS. The venue is 20km outside central Singapore so if travelling independently, bear this in mind, particularly the heavy traffic. This tour only cost £30 so I would strongly advise booking.The tram ride through the various animal areas was excellent and many animals seen e.g. lions, elephants, rhinos, blach bears, hippos and giraffes. No flash photography allowed and impossible to take photos due to light and distance. Nocturnal Animals presentation was quite good but very ""staged"" and deliberate - duration 30 minutes. With transit took 4hrs 30 mins in total, 6.30 pm to 11.00 pm so missed dinner. As a result we had to eat some fast food at the venue the range of which is largely chinese and expensive for fast food. Altogether a must-see and highly recommended."
,,A good night out,4.0,,"I would suggest to anyone wanting to do the night safari to do it in combination with the river safari. We did the both with Tour East from 1.30pm to 11pm return to the hotel. It is very well organised and you get to see both parks and also get priority tickets for the tram ride. The night show is okay and after that you have to fight long queues to get the main event the tram ride, unless you have priority booking. We waited for 10 minutes and after the 40 minutes ride we still saw the same people waiting."
,,Great to be so close to the animals,4.0,,"A rather magical zoo visit, where one gets on a tram after night fall and see the wonderful nocturnal animals. This is a well-run operation that is very popular with locals as well as tourists. There was a presentation in a 700 person capacity outdoor ampitheater that included an otter coming out of the water, picking up a tin can and place it in a recycling bin."
,,Night Safari is not very authentic,3.0,,The safari is well organized. But the animal in there are seems setup and artificial. Its bit boring and feels overpriced. Throughout the tour the animals were eating the food and not much movement from them.
,,Time well soent,4.0,,"My girlfriend and I attended the night safari with Tour East Touring Company through Viator (app).

The buffet was reasonable.

The night safari train guide was well spoken and informative even if the script they read from seemed repetitive at times. Unfortunately she struggled to contain some people doing flash photography which it was mentioned was prohibited, stopping to tell them multiple times throughout the train ride.

We came to see the big cats (lions, leopard and tigers) and we weren't disappointed, we were lucky enough to see one of the large male lions wandering and roaring! Other notable animals included the hyenas, elephants, flamingos, fishing cat, giraffes and zebras. Also on the walks we saw more of the smaller animals like the slow loris as cute as they are.

I would recommend wearing some bug spray as you are in the ""middle of the jungle"" as our guides put it so expect mosquitoes and other insects, although being from Australia we're used to this.

We greatly appreciated the talk regarding animal conservation as education for the guests.

The other thing worth mentioning is expect lines if you don't book through a tour company."
,,Loved this - but be prepared for no shows!,5.0,,We really loved this and as animal lovers we couldn't wait to get here. Be prepared for an odd no show and the token prat in the train on the way around - they ruined the wold howling for everyone in the train and were suitably ostracised !!
,,Try the night safari,4.0,,We tossed up whether to do a day or night visit. Chose the night and glad we did. Heaps of people had the same idea. Obviously you see more during the day but the experience was well worth it. Was going to buy a beer afterwards till I saw the price. An ice cream hit the spot though.
,,Something different but lines too big,3.0,,"It was an interesting experience to walk around a Zoo feeling like you were there ""after hours"". It was quite a strange feeling but we loved it. The train ride at the start was good too and went at a good pace. However the lines are just ridiculous! After being at the Singapore Zoo all day and then going across to the night safari, (which I assume lots of people do) it's such a long day/night to be waiting hours in line. We actually spent more time waiting in lines than at the zoo. After the tram ride we probably only spent another hour walking around the tracks. As expected it's very dark and hard to see a lot of the animals and u can't take any photos. I think we would have been better coming back here another day when we weren't so tired and feeling a little ""over it""."
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,"We enjoyed the night safari, the way it's set out is wonderful. Our only criticism are the queues, queues to get in, queues to get on the tram (several times) and queues to get in to see the show which we didn't end up doing, we just got over the crowds. Also the price to eat there is very expensive, I would recommend eating beforehand or taking snacks, and most of all be prepared to queue!"
,,Adventures in the night,5.0,,"Amazing place! For kids, teens, and adults alike! :)
Recommend spending a day here for the Zoo, River safari and Night safari.
Look out for timings of the shows/exhibits on the website. And save money with the ParkHopper Plus pass.

I don't know how you would do it, but maintain energy for the night so that you can explore the walkable treks. Most of the folks stick to the tram ride. But it's different fun to take the walking paths."
,,Different experience,4.0,,It was a very different experience here. Not seen anything like this. A small train sort of vehicle to take you in the open jungle to see animals roaming around. Very different.
,,Waste of time & money,1.0,,"Singapore zoo is excellent. Don't bother with the night safari or the river safari.
The crowds are huge as it opens at 7.15pm so everyone comes here after the zoo. We were told to line up to take the tram. It was raining so I thought that this must be the only option. It turns out that everyone must get on a tram to be taken to a point where there are the walking trails. We were told that we could not walk for safety reasons with the trams.
With all the noise from people & the lightening all the animals would be hiding. We sat in a nearby restaurant waiting for our 9.20p bus back to the city watching all the chaos."
,,Friday nights out,1.0,,"Terrible. Does not worth the dollar to come here. Gosh we could not even see the animals since it's so dark. You can't see the animals but definitely we can smell them. Paid $45 to smell the animals.
Singapore zoological garden, it's either you provide visitors with night vision goggles or add more lights (which is impossible as it will affect their habitat).

It's a ripped off.
Never ever again.

(No picture provided as it's too dark)"
,,Nice place,5.0,,There was a promotion going on and we decided to visit the place and we really enjoy ourselves. It's a must go place if you visit Singapore.
,,Lovely but a bit dark,4.0,,I enjoyed the tour with a Friend but at night you are not able to see Tio many animals. Also have to use plenty of mosquito repellent.
,,Amazing place. Must visit,5.0,,Night safari is the perfect place to see night life of animals (When they are mostly active. ) Well maintained place. Good collection of animal from entire world.
,,Wouldn't rush back,2.0,,Myself and my partner had been to an amazing night safari in Chiang Mai so couldn't wait to see this one. Unfortunately although the safari was well setup there were minimal animals and the enclosures weren't that great. We definitely won't be rushing back to this one.
,,Jurassic Park in Singapore!,4.0,,"Night Safari in Singapore is a serenely unique experience! Although you feel the animals are near you, they are kept apart from you because of hedges or fences covered in the darkness!"
,,Good Fun Unique experience,5.0,,Great Fun for the whole Family my kids loved the tram ride. For the avid enthusiast there are walking trails so they can have an up close and personal look at the animals vey informative ride with good English commentary the staff are lovely very helpful. Very unique open exhibits when you see the lion without any cage you get a bit scared but all in all great fun good experience. The fire show at the entrance before the tram ride is something else be sure to catch that.
,,After reading mixed reviews I was not sure.,3.0,,I had been to the Zoo before and thought I would try the night safari. The animal show started off over capacity but people started walking out half way through. The tram ride was a great length but some of the animals could not be seen. It is a good experience for children.
,,Good for the first timer,4.0,,"Since it was the first time for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Couldn't say the same for my mates."
,,First time visit and I like it!,5.0,,"While queuing for the park to open, we were entertained by the fire throwing performance (free of charge) next to the entrance.

once in, Clear signs directed us to the ""creatures of the night"" show (free of charge). The show is not exceptional but the compere was very entertaining. She speaks with so much enthusiasm and very good English and very engaging. Well done! Not easy if you are doing this repeatedly.

Next was the tram ride (free of charge). Very convenient and pleasant ride. The temperature was a tad cooler in the evening amidst all the trees. Wish the tram could stop a while longer at each exhibit so we could spot the animals and observe their habitat more. Nevertheless, we learned a lot from the English commentary while on the tram.

The zoo, river safari and night safari are all next to each other so it was a fruitful trip today as we visited one after another."
,,I found it Average.,3.0,,No photos allowed with flash on your camera or mobile in short no photographs could be captured as the lights are not sufficient to capture a proper photo. I found the Austria zoo much better then this. As the animals almost were asleep during the night safari. dint enjoy much.
,,Unique experience! Don't bother waiting in line before opening,4.0,,"This is a truly unique zoo experience! Walking the trails, you almost feel like you're exploring a jungle rather than in a big tourist site. The tram allows you to see bigger animals and take a break from walking. The creatures of the night show was worthwhile too. We visited with 3 and 5 year olds and stayed from 7 pm til about 10:30 pm. We could have stayed even longer if it wasn't already so far past their bedtime!

My only criticism is the ticket price. The cost is high for the amount of time the zoo is open, but I would probably still recommend it since it's unlike any other zoo experience.

We bought tickets for the 7:15 pm opening but they actually opened up around 6:50 pm, so arrive a little early. People began waiting in line starting spring 6 pm but as far as I could tell there was never any benefit to that. Everyone got in at roughly the same time."
,,Disappointing and costly,2.0,,We visited the zoo at night on the night safari tour. A lot of time spent looking at animal shadows. Did get a quick look at the Asian elephant but it must have been the last train as it was no more than 40 seconds. The show at the end of the tour was a drag and not worth waiting around for.
,,Great place for kids!,5.0,,This was an awesome day spent with the family at the Singapore zoo. Strongly recommend the Night Safari!
,,It´s worth a visit to see night active animals in a zoo,4.0,,"Booking this event is very simple: Ask for it at your hotel reception. Then you will be picked up at your hotel and also brought back to it. We started from our hotel at 18:15 and were back at 22:45.
The organization during this trip with a guide was perfect. On arrival the guide bought the tickets for us so we didn´t have to wait in a long lane! First activity was the round trip by Night Tram. Taking photos from the moving tram in the dark (flash is absolutely forbidden) is very difficult and the results are poor. After the round trip you can decide on further activities by yourself. Select from Walking Trails (Fishing Cat Trail, Leopard Trail, East Lodge Trail or Wallaby Trail), join the show ""Creatures of the night"" and/or see the ""Thumbuakar Performance"" (fire-playing feats and energetic stunts).
Finally there are plenty offerings of food, drinks an gift shops. But the prices are exorbitant and therefore not acceptable for us!"
,,Night Animals Kingdom,4.0,,"Night Safari opens at 6 pm daily.
For Team ride there is time slot given so rush is controlled.
There are also night animal shows but incase of rain than shows may get cancelled.
If ur lucky u may see animals with the Tram ride which also gives Commentary in English as the tram passes."
,,One night visit and see tens (maybe more a hundred) of wildlife animals,4.0,,"The experience is better than a day visit to singapore zoo. I was rather surprised that the animals were mostly very active during the night compare to a day visit to the zoo.

The tram ride was also very convenience for those that don't like to walk in the hot humid climate in singapore. It also convenience for seniors that has challenge with mobility.

During my visit, the weather was about 24-27 deg C, and a little drizzling. Actually, its another kind of experience to visit this place while drizzling. Maybe drizzle makes animals more active.

My visit fall on weekday. I'm surprise that the park has quite a sizable visitors."
,,Mediocre,2.0,,Was highly recommended but disappointed. Visually ordinary. Better to visit zoo in the daytime or the jurong bird park
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"A very unique experience. Don't bother trying to take photos as no flashes are allowed so that the animals don't get startled & the safari train doesn't stop long enough at any exhibit for a night photo to focus. Best to just enjoy the animal experience. We did a tour that included a buffet dinner that was much better than expected and included dessert and non alcoholic drinks. The tour had priority boarding for the safari ride but the 9.30pm show is first inline first in. On the tour when the animal safari is finished you can choose to go to the show, a short walk to see more animals or go to shopping for souvenirs. If you decide to do everything the tours give you the option to find your own way back, a taxi is about $25-30."
,,Waste of time...,1.0,,"1) Fire show before start of tour was excellent.
And all other thing not up to the mark,

1) Very Long Queue before entry,
2) many animal not visible in night.
3) tool long time to reach as it is outside city.
4) only 20 to 25 animal available from world, and most of them from Indian region"
,,Wonderful atmosphere,4.0,,The atmosphere on trip was something else and the various sites and entertainment was fantastic if you only do one trip while in Singapore this is a must
,,Scary but GOOD scary,5.0,,"Now I understand why my mom never brought us here when we were young.
I brought my daughter to experience the night safari and I found out myself how scary it is...imagine riding a tram w/o walls and having all these wild animals on the side with only some bushes between you?
Its for those adventure seeker with so much appetite for danger. ( but I'm sure night safari staffs ensures your safety)
But for a mom like me with young kids, especially if your kid may cry during the tour, please reconsider...
Good thing our child was fast asleep that time...
But for other, I would suggest you to try...its a great experience!"
,,Different,3.0,,"It was a different experience to be so close to animals like lions, leopards and tigers.. overall the place was really nice.. loved the walking trails.. the creatures of the night show was alright"
,,Nice Attraction!,5.0,,"A very unique and different concept of seeing animals during the evening. They have a tram tour which takes you around the entire park. They also have some shows at the park. Can get a bit crowded, especially during weekends and public holidays."
,,Family Visit (just horrible),1.0,,"Three words - My blood boiled....

Look the rating of the attraction is harsh because there has been a massive effort in setting up what appears to be on the surface a fantastic wildlife park for the animals..

Where this place is so horrible is organisation.

We've three kids under 7 so as you can imagine its not easy controlling these little buggers at the best of times however the park needs to accommodate families.

Entry Queue - put it mildly I was angry.. My son got pushed over by an Indian tour group whom thought they had the right to push through. Who pushes a 5 year old over to then just ignore his crying... after 10 mins of comforting him we re-joined the queen only to then be faced with massive wait times.

Tour Busses - You'd think that the staff would ensure the busses are full and every seat taken, nope. There is room for 4 on each bench seat, some left with only 2 on a seat.. that meant more times in the queue for us.

Staff - I asked three staff members for assistance when my boy got bowled over.. not one helped. Then when asking for guidance I may have as well asked one of the animals...

Needless to say all three of my boys fell asleep before the tour started, then we had some rude person decide that talking on the tour was a fantastic idea..

Honestly I cannot recommend this place... Even when I complained after the event I was given some BS response effectively denying the organisation was bad.

This place needs a family queue say 40 mins before the main entry opens with a kids only policy (say for those under 5).

You've two options a. head to one of the other wildlife parks b. pay a little extra and get yourself a VIP pass, you bypass the queues..."
,,Don't bother,2.0,,"We came here as part of an arranged tour and heard nothing but great things about this. Also been told it is a must do when you come to Singapore...
Unfortunately we were very disappointed! We had a buffet meal in Ulur Ulur which was very average. We then got the tram round the park - none of the animals are nocturnal so really didn't see the point of it being a ""night safari"".
We did all the walking paths within an hour and the two best parts was the Slow Loris as we have not seen before and was very active and the tiger who was up against the glass. The rest: the animals were either sleeping or you couldn't see them.

I really wouldn't bother with this trip!"
,,Enjoyed but could be better,3.0,,"This was my second time on this Safari. More direction should be given with the walking tour. We were herded into long lines and forced to standing for over an hour just to be put on a shuttle bus that was not being filled to capacity. There were several seats not filled in 2 people on some seats not 4. I would have much rather walked the tour but was not given the option.

At the Lodge in the park on the trails we stopped for a yogurt at 9:30 pm and the guy said "" only soft drinks available"". Why have that open if your not selling things. Your last group goes in at 10:15 but they close at 9:30?

Do this tour at least once. Maybe don't go on weekend lines are ridiculous."
,,"Unique experience, but be careful",3.0,,"Well, first of, the Night Safari is really a unique experience. I visited it twice in the last few months. But there are two points, that keep me from giving more than average.

First of all, the food outside the venue is low compared to the normal standard in Singapore. The meat is of poor quality, especially when considering the price of the food.

The second thing is the Creatures of the Night show. The show itself is ok. But the seating in the amphitheatre is designed in a way, that probably 1/4 to 1/3 of the seats on the outer edges aren't able to see the complete stage. So you will miss parts of the show, when sitting there."
,,A wonder,5.0,,"If your planning a trip to Singapore don not miss this attraction, the wide variety of animals is exceptional, we did the night tour however I feel the day tour would be a better option."
,,One of the best experience ever,5.0,,"Couldn't get our minds round the idea of a night zoo/safari. Hats of to the idea. Truly unique experience. Got to see the animals active like never before. It's a very good way of seeing nocturnal animals feeling so comfortable in their environments and at their own time. Shows were all very good, interesting and inspiring especially the part about recycling. Take rest during the day to have greater enjoyment because it will get late."
,,Best experience in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing and different experience other than ordinary morning ZOO. Very well organised and value for money. Night safari as the name suggests going thru kind off a jungle with so many different animals from around the world while sitting on a tram like open train. Best time to start 730pm or max 830pm not later as they feed animals after that and most of the people complain that they cant see any animals. Excellent customer service and staff was so helpful. Better of to have your dinner before starting yr Night safari trip as it takes min 3hrs to finish.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"So. You know when you go to these zoos and see all of the enclosures with the signs that tell you what you could see if the thing actually hadn't decided that it had had enough gawping and gone and hidden self in the remotest corner so there's no way you are going to see anything? You don't get that here. From start to finish, you get an amazing experience of animals within touching distance in many cases (not that I am saying that you want to touch them.) Get there for the first entry because you will need all of that time to walk around. There is a train/tram too but by walking you will experience so much more. If you like zoos even remotely you are not going to believe how many different animals you see here and the whole thing, although quite busy, is arranged extremely well. You will need to keep an eye on travel times because it's a fair drive from the city centre but there are plenty of cabs available even at the last knockings. A really good experience."
,,Not just for the kids us oldies enjoyed it!,4.0,,Went with tour east and combined it with the river safari. As we were out on Sentosa at the Shangrila hotel and because the safari is quite a way out of the city we did not wish to do this ourselves. Because we were already out there for the river safari we were in fact front of the queues and went on the first tram unlike others I would not recommend getting off the tram when it is busy as it would be very hard to get back on again instead do the full circuit and then do the walking trails. I wished I had more time to do all 4 walking trails as that is definitely the best bit if just a bit creepy when no others are around. With hindsight would not have bothered with the creatures of the night show which took up a load of time for what it was and done more on the walking trails. No fireshow when we went which was in a Wednesday. Yes it was a bit manic but we enjoyed the experience and glad we did it.
,,Night visit,2.0,,"This visit was recommended as the Zoo was said to be more open plan than is usual. I didn't find it so.
I don't approve of zoos as a South African who has visited many game parks with free roaming wild animals.
Some of the animals looked pretty skinny and not too healthy.
The overall experience was okay."
,,VARIATION ON A ZOO VISIT,4.0,,"Night safari is a separate part of the zoo and is as the name implies a night visit to a zoo. From downtown the zoo is located about 40+ miles from downtown. We used our SMRT tourist pass and took the train to the end of the east line and then crossed to the bus terminal and took the bus to the end of the line. Travel time is 1 to 1 1\2 hrs. Go early as the lines start early and are long, Be prepared for a long wait. Entrance fee is fairly steep. Once you get to the head of the line you will board a tram and ride thru the open animal enclosures. No flash photos requested on the 30 minute tour. You can also walk the entire path of the tram or do both. There are food stands, souvenir shops and some other entertainment. If not for the crowds and lines it would be an enjoyable visit. Hope this helps."
,,The Best in Singapore,5.0,,"This is easily one of the best thing to do if you are in Singapore. The tram ride is very informative as you to get to know lot of details about the wild animals, but the walking trails are the best part as you get to see lot of wild animals up close without much fencing or barrier. With very minimal security staff, it is an adventure which you do not want to miss at all. We heard a loud roaring sound during one of our walking trail and when asked the nearest security staff, he casually replied ""that's the lion roaring"". It sent a shiver down the spine for a couple walking with us.

The creatures of the night show is recommended to check out some nocturnal animals.

ps: As we are not allowed to use flash which disturbs the animals, I would recommend to throw away the camera / phone and enjoy your time at the safari."
,,"Chance to see nocturnal animals, maybe...",3.0,,"The NIght Safari is a good chance to see how animals behave in the night. But, sometimes they might just be there standing or sleeping, so it depends on the night.

The Night Safari has a guided tour on a ""tram"" and they stop at every animal and explain details about the animal.

They also have walking trails where you can see the animals on your own pace. The entrance can get crowded, so by the ticket online and be there on time."
,,Great and Bad,4.0,,"The night started really well with a great guide called Stephen who made sure we were aware of everything. We then went to the light show at the Gardens, that was wonderful and thankfully the rain the threatened stayed away. E then went to Marina Bay Sands Skypark where we had a wonderful view of the Singapore night skyline.
Things went downhill from there. The supposed display on the edge of the river was atrocious and somehow after that I ended up being the only person from our tour group that ended up at the nominated meeting place, the information desk inside the shopping mall, perhaps it had something to do with the doors not opening from the outside after a certain time (I had gone in to use the toilets) but I ended up waiting from 5 minutes before to 10 minutes after the designated time with no sign of anyone else. So that meant I missed the river cruise and more importantly the bus back to my hotel. Luckily there are 100s of taxis so I got back OK.
There needs to be some way that you can contact the tour guide in future so that you can call and reconnect."
,,First time visit in Singapore,5.0,,People always visit zoo during the day time. First time to hear that zoo opens at night. We were so curious to visit zoo at night. We took the train to visit about 20mins. It was really amazing experience. It was so closed to animals and we had tour guide to explain all animals habits and where they come from. It was quite interesting. Have to go when you visit in Singapore.
,,Nocturnal Buddies,5.0,,Must try when in SG. I was totally amazed of how the place is maintained and well organized. Good experience for all ages. Loving the tram ride. It was awesome.
,,Don't bother!,2.0,,We loved the Singapore Zoo during day time! Loved it! The night safari came highly recommended but it was such a disappointment. There are hardly any animals and the ones that are brave to show up are being scared by stupid Chinese tourists that won't be quiet for a minute and kept taking pictures using the flash - after being told hundreds of times not to to that!!! The are lots of animal exhibits but it is so difficult to see them - I would not bother going there and was disappointed that i wasted my time and money.
,,Amazing zoo with a difference,5.0,,"You should not go here if you are only interested in taking photos of animals, however you should go here if you are interested in seeing animals. All animals, in their natural environment, actively doing things (eating, roaring, moving about etc). As this is a night safari, it is dark and taking good photos is impossible (you cannot use your flash). What this does though, is gives you a chance to really see the animals. It's amazing as they are all out active, not sleeping like you get in the normal zoos. The Creatures of the Night show is fantastic and I definitely recommend it. There are only a few of these shows a night (weather dependent) so make sure you get in early so you don't miss out. The train is a great way to see the majority of the animals, but don't forget to get off and do the walking trails, as you can rejoin the train at any time."
,,Night Safari Tour,3.0,,This tour was just ok and you would probably see more animals on a daytime walk. We opted for the dinner package and were able to move ahead of the line ups. The live show afterwards was a disappointment since few animals and birds were presented. We have been to better zoo shows in other cities.
,,Midnight Safari,5.0,,Every time we have visitors to Singapore I take them to the zoo and especially Midnight Safari. It's probably the overgrown child in me. Nighttime is the same zoo but feels like a different experience. Not sure where else in the world you can experience. It's remote to downtown about S$30 tax ride or less. Just fun for kids of all ages and signature attraction in Singapore.
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"The night safari is amazing, I've been 3 times now and highly recommend it. Great to see animals that aren't in cages(they have moats stopping them getting to you). Friendly staff, great tram system to take you around the park but make sure you get off at the stops for a walk around and then just jump on the next tram."
,,Average Night Safari,3.0,,"We find the night safari is pretty average or could be due to the rain. We took the guided train through the zoo, we don't find anything really attractive nor interesting."
,,Absolutely Outstanding,5.0,,I had expected to see quite a few animals but imagined that many would be shy and lurk nearer the back of their enclosures unless lured out by the staff offering a bit of food. How wrong could I be! We saw just about everything going and could hardly believe it. We booked the 8:15 slot and afterwards explored the walkways - finally leaving well past 11 pm. I cannot recommend this attraction highly enough.
,,Loved it -- book group transportation to avoid the crowds!,5.0,,"After booking transportation and tickets with the our hotel concierge, I went on the Night Safari with 5 other work colleagues that were in Singapore for a business trip. We paid $60 Singapore / $42 USD for each person. We were picked up at our hotel (the Marriott) at 6pm on a Saturday evening in a small bus and then taken to a larger bus, which then took us to the park. While we probably could have done it cheaper by buying our tickets online (there appears to be discounts), we thought the price was very reasonable as the Night Safari is pretty far from the hotel and the park was extremely crowded. It was therefore nice to have someone handle all this for us and to bypass the crowds since we were with a group. Our entry time was 7:15pm, which allowed us ride the tram through the park at dusk which means it wasn't too dark and we could actually see the animals. After that we walked on the trails which also allows you to see the animals up close. Afterwards, we got icecream and frappes before walking back on the bus. Great visit and would definitely recommend to others! One comment on the bus/van which took us to the Night Safari from our hotel -- neither had seat belts for their passengers."
,,Never again,1.0,,"The size of the habitats for the animals is way too small, this you can see on the movements of them that are unhappy this is so unfair on the animals. Also the rudeness of the photographs when we said we were not having our photos taken then tried to make us then were really rude when we said NO again not on at all!!! Would not got again !!"
,,"Too many people, too rushed",2.0,,"Although a good idea, if you can't book to go as soon as it opens you can't possibly see everything you'd like. It's much like a conveyor and seems to be set up primarily to maximize the amount of money they can get. It was a disappointment."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Once again, hats of to Singapore. Fantastic. Well organized, great design and brillant the way the animals are displayed and looked after. Well done Singapore."
,,Great nocturnal zoo visit,4.0,,"Having visited the main zoo in the daytime, we returned for the night zoo safari - a different part of the zoo. Amazing that so many animals were up and about, and we saw many nocturnal species we wouldn't have seen otherwise. Quite safe as everyone is transported through the zoo on a tram, with a good commentary about the animals seen. Great for adults and children."
,,Highly over rated,2.0,,"Singapore has many fine attractions but sadly this isn't one of them despite being heavily promoted, not least amongst the taxi drivers in the city who no doubt do a roaring trade in servicing the site. Tram ride doesn't offer great view of the animals and I wouldn't be sure just how pleasant conditions would be for animals anyway, having to to endure endless lines of trams full of people passing their enclosures. Live show afterwards would fit with similar comments, and is more like a circus act and not something with which I would be in favour.
The whole thing is also very touristy, with lots of merchandise and gimmickry on sale. This is heavily promoted as an animals preservation venue but in my opinion has mostly commercial motives."
,,Great return trip even for someone who grew up in Singapore,5.0,,"My wife has never been to Night Safari, so this time round I thought I'll take her to see it. As uninterested as I was, the visit was still surprising great and eye opening.

New design layout with the tram rides and the fact the animals may be right up beside you chewing on grass whilst driving by.

Always interesting and great to test your ""spot the animal/insect"" skills.

But remember to wear insect repellant."
,,Little bit of dissapointment,3.0,,"It is not real safari, more it is night zoo.

Unfortunately if you pick train, our guide didn't let us jump out when we wanted to take walking tour.

We recommend to take walking tours at beginning and take train at only stop train has (middle of the course)."
,,Different experience,4.0,,"Seeing animals in its habitat at night in a zoo is definitely different.. and we did it here in Singapore zoo. If you can walk a lot, take trail walk which would be more adventurous and thrilling (except, it's difficult to get a seat in tram when u wish to take it in between). Believe me, Tram ride is equally thrilling too."
,,i love it!!!!,5.0,,"i went to night safari and it was the coolst night ever, the workers are very friendly to explain and the animals are kept in good condition and its very clean."
,,A unique way to see animals,5.0,,"We went on a weekend (and started late ie at 8.30pm as tickets for the earlier entry were not available) so the tram queue was too long. As we wanted to see the Creatures of the Night show at 10.30, we again wasted more time in the queue soon after the tram ride (around 10.05) for good seats. We could only do 2 trails as we actually started walking only at 11. On hindsight we should've done the trails 1st and then come back for the show & then taken the tram ride (the tram had only a small queue at 11). Will plan better next time! Animals such as the Slow loris, fruit bats eating food, the elusive Clouded leopard & the lionesses who were very noisy & active at midnight had us captivated."
,,Not Impressed,3.0,,We were recommended to take this tour however very disappointed when we took it. The animals were not up close and personal so we could hardly make them out as they were so far away. Was told they were kept back by wire electrical fences. Not sure that's true but that's what we were told.
,,a must for kids,4.0,,Please do not have too high of expectations but is good in Singapore to be shown around the zoo on a bus and is great to see animals at night and in cooler environment.
,,Night safari,5.0,,Door open at 7.15pm. Get a taxi to take you to the night safari (ca 25 S$) or there are buses. Entrance about 45 S$. There is a tram which is interesting but the exhibits are best seen on foot. I never tire of going there. Of course there are gift shops. The food there is fine and not too expensive. There are animal shows for those that like that sort of thing. My favorites are the Asian Otters and the Slow Loris.
,,Once again night safari delivers,5.0,,3rd visit to this place and I still love it. I would go every time I visit Singapore. If you arrive for the opening head straight to the creatures of the night show. This way you will avoid the large queues for the tram safari. After the show the tram lines are less busy
,,Great experience,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to Night Safari. Tough taking photos without flash, but got to see most all of the animals. Seeing the bats up close was super cool. It's worth going thru a tour company to avoid the lines for the tram. I also recommend going on a weeknight if possible."
,,Okay kind of place,3.0,,This is not very exciting and had few shows .. but nothing to excite you so much .. may be kids will enjoy this place ..
,,Fabulously different way to view the animals on show,4.0,,"Totally forgot to review after a wonderful evening visit to the Singapore Night Safari, this was so different from the normal daytime zoo visit with shows put on to entertain, a tram taking you around the zoo (need to keep your eyes peeled as there are a lot of animals but some can be difficult to pick out) animals will also be walking around next to the tram which makes it even more interesting. Food is available and overall a great, and different, experience of wildlife."
,,Uncommon way to see a zoo,5.0,,"We went in a Saturday, but even though it was very crowded, the queue to the safari train went fast. Most interesting than the train are the trails, when you can stop by the places you saw in the train, and also can see additional habitats.
Do not get scaried with the trails. Are safe and are the best part of the tour."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"This is a one time awesome experience which everyone should feel. The animals in safari are from different parts of globe. There are all types of animals varying from small to big sizes. The overall experience was due to proper planning by the volunteers and authorities. The volunteers are very friendly.
PS: Reach the location at park opening time and be there till the park closes to take a complete view of safari."
,,Interesting way to view animals but...,3.0,,"the low light makes it difficult to spot them. In addition, to see most of the animals, you will need to walk darken trails as the tram ride only covers some of the animal enclosures. Trails can be accessed from the courtyard or from the only stop on the tram tour, where you can get off or back on. I don't think it would be interesting to young children as you can't see much and there could be a lot of walking. The fruit bat enclosure was the most interesting to us to see them up close."
,,Don't go if you like animals,2.0,,"We visited the Night Safari in Singapore as we love animals and the reviews were good. After queuing for quite a long time to get tickets we then joined another queue to enter the park and then another queue to catch a tram. You've got the drift. We decided to take the walking tours instead which was a good idea. We got round the walking tours relatively easily. We then went back to the entrance to catch a tram, by which time the queues had reduced dramatically. The night safari is a great idea. Unfortunately we found that most people who attended treated it as a theme park ride. They were shouting, whooping, talking over the guides, taking flash photos and generally behaving in a manner which was disrespectful of the animals. The guides repeatedly asked them not to use flash, to sit down etc but were ignored. I made a shhhhhhhhh noise several times when it got really bad and thus worked, also encouraged others to do likewise. We left the safari feeling that the animal are unhappy and definitely not being cared for in a conservation way. So sad. The owners could turn this situation around very easily, by just emphasising at every opportunity that this is not a theme park, but a zoo."
,,Safari in a zoo...,4.0,,"It's pretty similar to the zoo, but the animals you get to see at night are different and more in number than what you can see at daytime in the zoo. There are well lit walking paths if you want to explore on foot or you can take the mini buses type vehicles (don't remember exactly what they're called) which will move along and pause at certain points where you can see the animals. We took the latter and it was really good and saves a lot of time and energy. Definitely you should not miss this on your trip to Singapore."
,,Good for the first timer but can be skipped,3.0,,Travelling by battery operated tram in the low light is a good experience but you hardly sight any animal worth the name in summer. It could be a good choice in winter months.
,,Superb Safari,5.0,,"When you arrive at 7.15pm (opening time) quickly buy your tickets including tram rides.
But when you are admitted into the Night Safari, DO NOT join the tram queue. Ignore the tram for the time being.
Instead, turn left towards the Fishing Cat Trail.
Enjoy enclosure upon enclosure of animals frolicking in the dark. It is such a treat for animal lovers like us!

Follow the trails all the way around the Night Safari. There is Leopard Trail and some others that I forgot the names.
This gentle hike (prams/stroller should be able to work your way around as well) might take about 2 hours leisurely. But our family took about 3 hours. Plus a little rest in the overpriced yoghurt place in the middle of the trails.

The setting is very dark so the animals happily go out to check the snacks the zookeepers left for them in every enclosure. We enjoyed observing each of them up close!
Only the flying squirrels did not show up because we were perhaps very late in visiting them already.

At the end of the trails we arrive back at the entrance of the Night Safari. So we can board the tram immediately. No queue!
And we were the only ones on the tram. It was like a private tour!!

What a relaxing night!
Thank you, Night Safari zookeepers.
Good job in setting up and maintaining this lovely Zoo ! ❤"
,,Disappointing from start to finish,2.0,,"Not sure why this gets so many good reviews . If you are travelling with children under 10 yrs old I guess they might at least enjoy the show . Food at the entrance was fairly basic . Certainly best not to go in on the first round of trams as very busy . You are on a tram with a taped audio , this takes you around to animal pens which are illuminated . Most of the animals were asleep . The pens are quite small and have little to reflect natural habitat . As a couple we found the experience and images very disappointing. After the tram you get the show , probably fun for the under 10's but not for grown ups . Location is some way out of town , cost around 20 dollars + each way in taxi. Would not repeat or recommend unless taking young children."
,,2012 visit,5.0,,A hot place but boy it was worth it. Excellent attractions to see and a must see place to visit in Singapore.
,,Good experience,5.0,,The night safari was a wonderful experience. The zoo is very well laid out and planned. Ideal for a family trip
,,Night visit,5.0,,"Went on a night tour, 4 50 yr plus...was great...well worth it....took the local bus to the zoo. The animals were active, much better than a day experience"
,,Disappointed.,3.0,,"Highly recommended by friends, so we went.
Very disappointed that most animals were either “hiding” somewhere or went to sleep somewhere. Even the ones we can see just showed their vague/fuzzy figures or shadows at most. The train driver moved so fast that we had no chance to have a decent glance at those fuzzy things.
The night tour arranged by the Hotel was not satisfactory in any possible way.
We left the Hotel on 6PM sharp, went to Chinatown to pick up other guests from different hotels. When we’re finally on the way to the Zoo, it’s 7PM already: a whole hour later. It took 40-45 min to get to the Zoo. Around 745PM, we were on “tour” train and see almost nothing. The “tribe show” was interesting.
The animal show was stark."
,,an unusual experience,5.0,,not sure what i expected but it was most enjoyable. The restaurant was also worth a visit. Opn until very late so you have plenty of time to wander
,,Not impressed.,2.0,,"We did the night safari but apart from the tram ride it was very disappointing, my daughter enjoyed it. But I found it rather boring and the animals difficult to see."
,,One of a kind zoo tour,5.0,,"Night safari is a great way to experience the zoo. The animals are largely awake and making a lot more noise. Some are a little disappointing as they are hidden away and impossible to spot, but all in all feels like a more romantic evening. Take mosquito repellent!"
,,Enjoyed the tram ride!,5.0,,This was a unique experience that we greatly enjoyed! They allow you to enter 15-20 minutes before your allotted time slot. I recommend getting tickets in advance. There are nice clean restrooms here as well as a few nice places to eat. It was hard to get good pictures as flash is not allowed.
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,3.0,,"Night Safari is one of the attractions for Singapore tourists. It is the only night safari ride in Asia. Well coordinated and well organized. If you are riding in Tram the whole time for night safari, it might get boring towards the end. For fit singles and couples, walk by trial night safari is recommended rather than tram ride!!! Overall, the mystical silent ride through the creatures of jungle, is definitely not to be missed!!!"
,,Magic of the night,5.0,,Night safari is a unique and great experience! Something new even if you had visited the ZOO before. I loved all unusual voices in the dark and felt like driving through the jungle in a comfort. The animals were close to the road as they put some food there before the opening. Seeing in the dark they look mysterious. The experience was well worth some waiting time.
,,It's an ultimate experience & thrill one can have in life time,5.0,,"The train ride through the rain forest at night is the ultimate experience & thrill one can have in life time. It was really an awesome experience. The world's first safari park for animals, this is here you can explore the rainforest at dusk, enjoy tribal performances, and more. This 20-minute animal extravaganza brings together a constellation of our night-time superstars who will thrill you with their natural and unique behaviors and skills. It’s a spectacular stage that brings you right into the heart of the rainforest."
,,Great zoo - hands down,5.0,,"Love the Orang-utans, any visitor to Singapore must do the zoo and night safari.....well if they like nature that is!"
,,HAS IT ALL,5.0,,It's a zoo so lets be frank there are naimals like any other zoo. It's reasonably priced and if combined with the Night Safari a great day. You need about 3hrs to do the zoo then the night safari so get there after lunch and go on.
,,"Oh, for those queues!",3.0,,"This is a must do activity according to everyone we spoke to.....but I beg to differ. Yes, the zoo part of it is indeed very special, full marks to whoever designed, manages and so on. Having said that, we had to stand in a queue for almost 40 minutes before getting in, then another one for the animal show (not worth the hassle, really), then yet another one to get on the tram ride.
Add to that a very steep entry price ($45 pp) and a fairly long trip to and from the zoo, and our conclusion was: never again wil we do 'the tourist thing'.
If you want to go anyway: from Chinatown it is around 1.5hr by MRT and bus (very easy to find and friendly, helpful bus drivers)."
,,Good night out,4.0,,"Booked the Night Safari directly online($43 each) the night before, this only saved us $9, not a lot but a discount all the same! Received an instant email with e-tickets to print off or leave on your phone. There are other sites offering bigger discounts but I believe you had to queue up & redeem your voucher on arrival for these. As we were staying in Orchard Rd, we took the MRT to Ang Mo Kio station, this took 30 minutes (mostly standing room only)at 5.45pm. On arrival at Ang Mo Kio, walk to the underpass to the bus station & catch the 138 to the Singapore Night Safari. It cost $2.20 each, ideally have the correct money as no change is given. Our trip took 40 minutes on the bus but it was rush hour. To be honest I think this was the furthest the bus went but you couldn't miss your stop. Arrived at the Safari & the queue was long but moved very quickly. We did the 4 walking trails first, each trail took around 20 minutes each to walk. Then we caught the tram ride which is 40 minutes long. This way if your legs are tired you get a rest! There was a much smaller queue for the tram, as everyone seemed to do the tram first. Doing the walking trails and the tram allows you to see all the animals from different sides. We didn't see either show but I am sure they would have been great. We caught the 138 back to Ang Mo Kio station which took 25 minutes. Don't forget the MRT stops running at 11.30pm. If you get stuck and you miss your bus to the MRT we were informed by the park there are other buses that will take you back to the city for $6 each and they left as late as midnight to most hotels in the city (list was at information desk). It had rained all day so we were skeptical whether it would be any good but it added to the atmosphere. It had actually stopped raining when we got there. We really enjoyed this attraction. We saw all the animals except the Leopards. We didn't eat & drink as we took a few bottles of water & had eaten before we went. No one checked our bags so you could easily take some food/drink with you. The food & drinks was expensive but that's what parks are like!"
,,What a waste of an evening- so disappointing.,1.0,,"QUEUING
We had bought tickets online and arrived early for our 7.15 slot. Given no instructions about which queue to join, we wasted 15 mins in the wrong queue. Then waited a further 40 minutes in a queue of maybe 400 people before we boarded. I should have bailed out then!
THE TRAIN TRIP
Commentary was cheesy. The tram stopped when the guide could see the animal (she was up the front). We got her spiel, then we moved on. Those in the back half of the train saw the animal from the moving vehicle as we sped off.
Because we had queued so long, it was quite dark by the time we got on the train- photography was out of the question. The animals were at quite a distance usually, and we had only brief glimpses.
STOPS
There was only ONE chance to get off and see anything on foot, and we were restricted to one very short walking trail before we had to reboard the train. YOU ARE NOT FREE TO WALK AROUND INDEPENDENTLY.
THE ROUTE
The train only covers a limited part of the zoo at best, and we had brief glimpses of maybe 10 species of animals in the dark.
CONCLUSION
Save your money and your evening. If you want to see the animals, visit the zoo independently during the day- I'm so sorry we didn't do that!"
,,It was an amazing experience,5.0,,"The night safari was money well spent, we got a dinner along with our night safari and the food was really good and authentic. The tram ride gave us informed details before we went out on our own. Though we did not get to watch the show because of the weather, we heard that the previous ones were really good."
,,River cruises and night safari,5.0,,"Visited the zoo this week. This has got to be the best zoo in my opinion that I have visits. Very clean and minimal odor. Overall the staff is very nice aswell. Especially Wanru, she was prompt in helping us figuring things out and gave personal attention to get us back on track! One of our best experiences in Singapore so far."
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"The night safari was such an amazing and unique experience. It really adds such a totally different dimension to see the animals in the dark. The tram tour was amazing, although it does mean that you might miss some of the animals if they don't happen to be out and about at the time you go past and you can't walk back to see all of them (for example, the hippos were hiding and you can't go back to see them and the white lions were hiding but those you can walk back and view from a platform)
The cage-free enclosures really make this experience special. It was actually a little unnerving to walk past the hyenas as they stood slightly above you looking out into the dark!
It was really great to see some more unusual animals like the slow loris and the pangolin. The show is also fantastic.
It's a great day out done in combination with the river safari which is right next door and only requires a few hours to walk around. You could visit the river safari from 2 or 3pm onwards and then go straight into night safari at 7pm with time to grab some food in between. (Night Safari has timed entry points which are like 7pm, 8pm & 9pm so you need to bear this in mind if trying to do both in one day otherwise you could be waiting around a lot in the middle). I wouldn't suggest visiting the zoo & night safari on the same day (the zoo is also right next door) as the zoo is so massive and takes all day to get around that I think you'd be too tired to enjoy the night safari properly if you did them both on the same day."
,,A great night out,5.0,,Much better to go at night to the zoo than in the day time. Day is too hot. Night Safari is well organized and staff are friendly. Get there early go to the show first.
,,Stroll in the Park,5.0,,"Its literally a walk in the park- trails actually- with lots of animals to admire. Educational and interestingly captivating in understanding the animals and their habitat. Definitely a great conversational topic for families especially kids and yes, lovebirds too. When youre done walking, theres always the tram ride around and back. To cover the whole area itll take you roughly about 3-4hrs, walking, animal shows and tram rides. Please do check it out!"
,,something different with others safari,5.0,,we have a great time here. the train shuttle will bring you through the safari. that a lot to see and learn a new thing about safari
,,"Great, up close view of a lot of Animals--kids loved it.",5.0,,"Don't miss the Night Safari. This is a unique experience--like the Zoo at night, with less fences and more natural barriers to separate the animals. There are very few lights, just some along the trail. On the night that we went all of the animals were out in their habitats. It had poured rain all afternoon but we took the chance and went and there was just a very light sprinkle, which probably helped bring out the animals. There are very few fences here, mostly moats to keep the animals in a specific area. There were lots of big cats and many other animals. You can walk or take a tram. If you wait for the tram (double bus) you can ride through most of the trails and you get an excellent view of the animals. You can also walk, which would be very exciting, as it is dark and you are walking in between the enclosures. The tram line moved quite quickly. We were at the end of the marked off zig zag line and it took about 20 minutes to get to the tram. This safari can be a lot of walking and it doesn't even open until evening when children are getting tired so I would recommend the tram first then walk to anything else you want to see."
,,Top attraction,5.0,,"It's easy to see why this is one of the top attractions for tourists visiting Singapore, it's brilliant to see the animals up and about feeding and searching for food, then into the auditorium for the bird show
This is a must for anyone visiting this fantastic city"
,,To fill in Bordem,3.0,,"Not enough time to complete all the activity that it has to offer, very expensive for food and beverages"
,,Underwhelming experience,3.0,,"This night safari was a very underwhelming experience. At SD$60, I thought it was expensive for what was on offer. I was prepared for a lack of animals to be viewed at night, but not for how few were actually 'on-show'. The price of foods at this location is very expensive, so take a snack if cost is an issue.

I would like to go back and see the day zoo, as a comparison, but I couldn't recommend the night safari."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"The most excellent view of the animals. The lighting is like moonlight, so the animals are comfortable, and moving around naturally. Saw 2 lionesses having a wonderful rumble and play, something I've never seen in a zoo before. 40-minute tram ride around the park first, then the opportunity to walk along several pathways to see cheetahs, leopards and lots of other animals. All paths well-lit and safe. it was recommended to me that I see it, and I'm passing the recommendation on!"
,,Not what was expected,3.0,,"From previous reviews thought it would be a great experience. Booked a skip the Line tour and from our my experience if you are considering the Night Safari from an out of country perspective then it is the right type of tour to consider. The Buffet part of the tour was acceptable, the 40 minute tram looking for animals in enclosures was rather disappointing. Lots of deer some elephants, a Giraffe, Pigs a glimpse of a hyena some lions and a tiger were about the highlight. Others animals were very hard to see or very elusive. The transport to and from the venue was a little disjointed. Maybe if you have the time and wish to explore the the Night Safari at your own pace then I would suggest walking the trails would be the preferred option. That way you may get to see all the zoo has to offer at your own pace. The night time show was also over crowded disappointing."
,,Enjoyed it but leaves a lot to think about,3.0,,"We had a great time - teh shows are great and the experience is also very cool. Never done this before so was certainly a once in a lifetime experience however there was something quite unnatural to the experience.
We walked one of the trails and took the tour train around, however it felt like we were invading the animals natural sleep and rest time.
The show was also pretty good but if you are afraid of Snakes it is best to leave when there is a 'Rustle' in the leaves."
,,Waste of time,2.0,,"We did the night safari in February 2017 with our young daughter. We booked through a tour company which provided transport to and from our hotel on Sentosa and allowed us to jump the queues.

The Good. As with all Singapore attractions it's very well packaged and polished. Good food selections, a good vibe and neat and tidy. There's enough to do to keep you interested for an hour or two. You will (may) see some animals within 4 - 5 metres or so. Staff, for the most part, are friendly and helpful.

The Bad. It's dark. Ok so there are special lights that allow you to see... well kind of... but it's not like seeing animals during sunlight hours at your own pace. Just about every animal on the tour you can see just fine in most other zoos during the day. As with all Tourist traps like this, you are simply a number hearded like cattle through the attractions... and exit past the gift shops. The tram whizzes by every enclosure so that only a glimpse is possible and thus no real time to have a good look.

It's worth mentioning that the zoo is about 30min in a charter bus or taxi from the city area.

We saw one male lion and some Elephants at close range, but many others were elusive. You may see some deer, a bear or two, a peek at a tiger, some cattle, hyenas, rhinos, flamingos and the seemingly obligatory zebra / giraffe enclosure. It's rushed, rather dull and... err... dark.

It's a tourist trap... pure and simple. For those who love animals, or really enjoy the packaged, ""off the shelf"" type tour may find some value here. I did not. Even my young animal loving daughter thought it was just ok.

On the whole very disappointing."
,,"Good, but Over-hyped",3.0,,"Did a ""Night Safari"" tour in February with the family. Our reason for electing to do this tour was the overwhelmingly positive reviews from all and sundry on TripAdvisor and other similar sites. I did the tour with my husband and 2 (nearing 3) year old daughter.

So, I'll begin with the positives:
1. We booked ""jump the queue"" style tickets meaning we were ushered through the gates with no wait for the 'safari tram'
2. Prior to the zoo we were picked up from our hotel ahead of time by a minibus operator.
3. The tour was well organised and good information provided before arrival at the zoo.
4. Exhibits were very well presented.

And now for the negatives:
1. If you intend to go with young children please be aware that from your pickup point to the safari may we'll be up to 2 hours...
2. The tour doesn't begin its laborious return until 10pm. We opted for a taxi back earlier.
3. Don't expect any photos. It will be dark before you begin and flash photos are not allowed.
4. The night tour doesn't guarantee a glimpse of all animals. Some are still asleep/ hiding.
5. The safari tram moved at a fairly rapid pace. Blink and you might miss it!

Suggestions:
1. Eat before you go. No food is allowed on the safari ( as the animals may get ideas apparently)
2. Take mosquito repellent
3. Take a pram as there are a number of night time walk opportunities and as these will likely begin after your tram ride it will be late ie 9pm or after (zoo is open until midnight)
4. Go for the daytime zoo experience. You will still likely see just as many animals, if not more.

However all in all it was a good experience. My suggestion would be that value would be maximised for families with kids 4+ who have a little more staying power and still I'd argue that a daytime zoo visit might be a better option for a day trip!"
,,Liked the idea but wasnt completely thirlled,3.0,,"So the idea of doing a safari at night is truly exciting but you cant really control animals and obviously a lot of enclosures didnt have the animals around. We were the lucky ones to catch a few of the animals in their elements and saw a feeding session as well as a fight between otters. That was the highlight. The other not so great aspect is that it takes a good hour to get here, although they do have provisions for a pick and drop by a shuttle bus. And I was really blown away that when we were being picked up, the bus being full, we were asked to come by taxi and were reimbursed for it in full and dropped off back to our hotel. the best customer service I have ever experienced."
,,Minibus Maxi Cab Singapore @ Night Safari,5.0,,"If you're travelling in group party of 5 or more, the best way to travel to The Night Safari and Singapore Zoo with our Minibus Maxi Cab Singapore."
,,Very Unique Experience,4.0,,"I have visited Zoos in different countries but night safari in Singapore is a different unique experience. My visit to Night Safari was along with my wife , daughter and mother-in law. It opens at about 7:15 pm in the evening till mid night. While booking the ticket one has to choose the planned time of entry like 7:15 pm , 8:15 , 9:15 pm. You can get discount if you are a Singapore Citizen, PR, Employment Pass Holder. Once inside the Night Safari there are trams which take you through guided tour. One can also get down from tram at midway tram station and take a walk along the the trail. At the end of tram journey there is also a pretty animal show that you can watch.There is no extra cost to sit on the tram or to attend animal show. Everything is included in the Night Safari entry ticket."
,,Not worth it!,1.0,,"So....after reading rave reviews on trip advisor we went to the night safari. Well what a waste of time and money! First there is no form of organisation. We brought the 8:15 show tickets and it was 7:00 and all we saw was people racing for the entrance and huge line formed...basically no one tells you that you should also be in the line....also everyone just pushes in...no sorry, excuse me or thank you so be prepared! Then you have this awkward fire show whilst you are still in the queue???? I mean they were god but so random! After which the gates open and there's practically a stampede to get to the creatures of the night show........now this is the only bit where you see a few nocturnal animals . The rest of the safari you drive around and see animals that can be seen in any safari to be honest. Basically don't waste you're money here!"
,,Beautiful fire dance,4.0,,"Don't miss it if you are in Singapore though it is not the biggest worth of visiting this place because the of the effort that city nation to preserve wild life and nature.Fire dance is amazing, Animals are roaming freely it is better if they had more animals River cruise is nice didn't see animals along the river banks better more birds."
,,18th February 2017,4.0,,"Before you head down to night safari, its good to always check on the website. They might have promotions like 25% discount for online booking and special catering for those who wants to have a VIP experience, you can find a contact on the website.

There's entry time to the safari. its at 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm. Its always best to reach there early to get your tickets on time. Its usually crowded on the weekends and you might not be able to get the time slot that you want.

For a start, once you have gather at the assembly area, when they open up the ropes to queue for the entry lanes, take the one on the left, you will be able to get a clear view of the thumbuakar show. The show will start at 7pm, 8pm, 9pm. So while you are queuing at the entry lanes, you will be watching the show. Once the show end, the entry gates will be open.

Secondly, head on in to the safari, make your way to right, rush for the amphitheatre. Try to get seated in the middle section where you will be able to get a clear view of everything during the show. No flash photography is allowed during the show. It's a good 30 minutes and worth the watch. Once the show end, do not make your way out yet, you will be able to get a photo session with the animals.

Thirdly, you can choose to go for a walk along the trails or the tram ride, but i will advise to go for the walk first, once you're tired walking, sitting down on the tram will help to heal the aches. LOL.

Things to take note while along the trails, it could be pitch dark at certain areas and do not expect to be able to see all of the animals along the way. Some animals are only able to view if you go for the trails therefore its a must not to miss it.

Once you are back at where u started from, take the tram. Rest those legs while they bring you around the park to see the animals. You will be wondering why go around and see the animals again. Just like the trails, when taking the tram, you'll be able to see other animals which you will not be able to while on the trails. Especially the white lion.

Pointers :

Not all shops accepts nets / mastercard / visa so do have some spare cash with you at all times.

The Gift Shops are located at the entrance of the safari, therefore you can settle for it once you're done with everything before exiting the park.

Do carry a bottle of water with you, it could get pretty stuffy in the trails.

Standby your grabcar and uber app. You will need it for your way back. Taxis are kind of hard to get especially at night. The park is closed at 12 midnight. And using grabcar or uber will help you to avoid those midnight charges from the taxis.

Have Fun In Night Safari!"
,,Safari at its best,5.0,,Visited this place with family. Everyone enjoyed it. Children were happy to see different type of animals. Everyone enjoyed the fireshow. It happens after 30 minutes in evening. We had dinner at Ulu Ulu restro which is in nightsafari but not worth. It was not expensive but quality was not up to the mark. Enjoyed 3/4 hours in nightsafari.
,,Only in Singapore,5.0,,What a night! Highly recommend! Would be great to visit with kids also. Up close with all kinds of animals you wouldn't normally get to be. Worth stopping to watch the show at the end of the night too :)
,,Family trip to night zoo,4.0,,After spending whole day in ZOO you are missing a bit energy for another show. Driven in small open busses seeing different animal in the night is unique experiences for all family members.
,,Didn't rate it,3.0,,After spending all day at the zoo which I enjoyed then hit the river safari which was disappointing then the epic wait until our 7.15 pm booking. Maybe I would Have enjoyed a little more if I hadn't had such a long day. But just felt like we saw a heap of dear and cattle on the safari.
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"The thrill of viewing wild animal in the night is amazing. The tram ride takes you through any you get to see various animals on both sides. The ambience becomes different when the tram enters the rain-forest section. The about 30 minute tram ride is worth taking, but the wait time exhausts oneself. Worthwhile visit, enjoyed minus the too long wait time."
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,5.0,,"I would highly recommend the night safari. We were picked up at our hotel and taken by bus to the Zoo. Our guide for the complete tour, Linda Chan, joined us on the bus and entertained us from the start with her very entertaining, funny, witty commentary, observations on life. She looked after us so well. We didn't have to queue for anything, enjoyed a delicious buffet meal, and she managed to keep us all together (not an easy task) and get us all back on the bus without losing anyone. The tour itself was entertaining and educational, with emphasis on caring for the animals, recycling etc. The Tram progresses slowly and silently without disturbing the animals, so they were almost all visible, going about their usual nightly activities. The show on the natural stage was well run by a young woman who spoke her instructions to the audience in about 5 different languages. She was also entertaining and interacted well with the audience members, some of whom she selected from volunteers to take part in the show. Go and see it - you won't be disappointed."
,,Not worth it at all.,1.0,,"The wait time is ridiculous for what you get.

The poor animals who are mainly asleep are woken by bright lights of the safari and it's just dismal.

There wasn't much to see at all and I honestly don't blame the animals for wanting peace!

I would never go back."
,,Average Activity,3.0,,Might as well give this a miss if on a tight schedule. Animals are domesticated which takes away the thrill from the activity
,,Animals every where!,4.0,,"Trailing near the animals was a nice idea. The night safari included a 30min tram travel around the entire area. Later Trailing is the best option. It also has some show with animals but we missed it..
It can rain anytime in Singapore, so don't miss to carry umbrella!

Please book tour tickets well in advance. Don't be too late as it is a deserted place and away from city. It was tough for us to grab a cab!"
,,Not that great,3.0,,Its very okay type. This is only for the kids . Adults dont enjoy here . If you have kids in your group worth visiting.
,,Animals of the night,4.0,,"Visiting at night at the Night Safari when the animals came out is so interesting having me viewing a cat catching a fish in the river, an animal that can call so loud to the ear that I and my friend has to close our ears with our hands, beautiful animals, squirrels, night owl, and movement of many animals around the Safari, a place nice to go at night."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing experience. We enjoyed walking the trails and having the tram ride. Unfortunately did not attend the show.
,,Great night out,5.0,,All animals easily viewed. Got the little train around with good on board guided tour. You can also walk around
,,Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo,3.0,,"We purchased a ticket for the night safari along with the Zoo, Bird Park and breakfast with the orang-utans which made it much more affordable. To be honest whilst it was nice to be doing something different during our two week stay in Singapore the Night Safari was a little bit of a let down. The number of animals we saw was pretty sparse and most were too far away from the little tram to easily pick out any features in the dark. Only if you are time rich and keen to do something different."
,,must visit especially with kids,5.0,,"once of the best zoo we've been to (and we've seen a lot))). night safari was at the zoo was fun, but v. long Q and waiting time was over an hour!"
,,Good experience and past time.,4.0,,It's a good experience and past time for everyone. The children will enjoy it. Good to have a night out safari experience with family.
,,DISAPPOINTED,2.0,,"wE ATTENDED THE NIGHT SAFARI AND WAS DISAPPOINTED. The animals were few and far between, the elephants looked as thought some of them were chained to a rock, not sure. The queue was enourmous and the food terribly expensive. It also rained on the night we went and we found there was not much shelter particularly for the restaurants"
,,ordinary night safary,3.0,,"Night safari with a poor quality and quantity animal. Ticket are costly, foods are also costly. Avery ordinary animal show. Very bad experience."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"Night safari - for all ages even those in their 20s and 30s will find this interesting. Extremely well kept zoo, price isn't cheap but you won't get the same experience anywhere else - other than the actual safari itself."
,,"Boring, disappointing and Avoidable. Not worth the money",3.0,,"There was a lot of anticipation for the Night Safari trip, and made even more eager due to the long lines and crazy horrible crowds.
The long line started at least an hour before the first ride and that too there were several hundred people ahead of us. It was a terrible wait and the line never seemed to end.
The ride itself is expensive and ultra boring. definitely not worth the amount of the ticket. Half the animals couldn't be seen as the animals were at a distance some were not visible. This was very disappointing. Definitely not recommended.

The only saving grace was the animal show which was somewhat entertaining but that too was a bit of a drag. This is a complete waste of money. Not worth the hype created by visuals and advertisements."
,,Night Safari - What an experience!,5.0,,"You get to see almost all animals in their natural habitat. The environment is very controlled and the animals are so close still they would not come close to the tram, I am quite sure that they are sedated :-). The food here is very expensive. Overall a very good experience."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I loved the night safari it was fantastic. We had a bit of a hiccup to start as they kept forgetting our people for the tram as there were two separated lines but once we were on it was awesome.
,,Great Safari,5.0,,Its A Great Safari Located in Singapore Its Has All Sorts Of Animial It Is Divided In 7 Geographical Zone On Which The East Lodge Trail And The Leopard Trail Is Superb The Tram Ride Is The Must Activity You Should Do Here The Food Here Is Also Superb Excellent Place To Visit
,,Howling hyenas in the dark,4.0,,"We visited the night safari on a Monday evening. Everything went very smoothly from the pick-up, the dinner, the tram ride, the show and the return. We saw howling hyenas, elephant calves milking, a white lion, tigers, bears and so many more amazing animals. There was an extra element of excitement because it was dark and we were warned to not touch the free-range animals approaching the tram. The dinner was good and the whole place clean and well-taken care of. Had the feeling though of too many people and extreme commercialism.

We used TourEast and even though the transfer was fine, the busses were old and many of the seats broken. Also, there was a general feeling of a lot of wait time and then having to rush through dinner and leave the show early so as not to miss the bus back. The main benefit was having priority in the tram queue; no wait times."
,,A lot better than expected,5.0,,"I have high expectations because of the reviews I had read. It is definitely worth visiting. Book your ticket in advance and try to go during the week to beat the queues. I would recommend to start with the hiking trails and then take the tram at the end. The show is quite good for the children but seats are limited. Plan in advance.
What I liked the most was how quiet it was in some of the trails. It does feel as if you were in the jungle. Animals are fairly close and a good range.
Go early and take your time to explore. Really magical"
,,Become very touristy,2.0,,"This was my 3rd visit over 20 years and will not be going back. Very changed and become very controlled experience with horrible crowds and cues which did not move fluently. Had to book a time and this was strictly enforced. The animal show before hand was pathetic - a time filler to make you think you got more out of the park than you did. Cheesy. The food vendors are over priced and have lost their charm. The tram ride, although compulsory if you bother with the Safari, was uninspired- very limited animal views."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,An interesting place. Very busy but able to be fast tracked as part of a Tour East Company Tour. Good Tram ride. Good Fishing Cat walk. Not enough time to do other walks due to our Time constraints.
,,The zoo at night,3.0,,I was underwhelmed by this very popular attraction. Long waits with big crowds. The shows are for children and at best average. There are rides to take you through the areas which helps. Not easy to see some of the animals as it is dark.
,,Great experience.,4.0,,"A really well put together scheme. We saw animals hunting in the dark, a shame couldn't take photos, no flash photography allowed which is understandable, but still a bit too dark to use a camera. Enjoyed our visit."
,,Disappointes,1.0,,I had never been to a zoo - I felt the enclosures were too small and perhaps the animals would have been better off not illuminated for 5 hours a night when they want rest...
,,A must-see for kids,4.0,,"We were told that it's far from where we were coming from which is Sentosa so we just took a cab to go there. Our taxi fare was about SGD30. We left Sentosa at 7:30 and we reached Night Safari at 8PM.

Our ticket is for the 9 PM slot so we were not allowed to go inside the zoo yet. Fortunately there are food stalls you can dine in to or look and buy some souvenirs while waiting.

We went to see the show first. Some adults may find it a bit of a bore but the kids had fun watching some animals do a bit of tricks.

The tram tide was fun as well. You get to see the animals up close except for the hyenas, lions and tigers. The elephants and the rhinos are majestic. The little animals like the otters and wallabies are so cute the kids want to touch them.

What I liked about it is that private companies adopt the animals. Tiger Balm adopted the tigers :) :) :) I suppose this guarantees that the animals will be well taken care of because the zoo has the resources to do so. The zoo also helped the animals breed to somehow avoid extinction.

The tram ride took about 40 mins but we still wanted to go around the trails to see more animals up close but our kids are already tired so we opted to go back to the hotel. we took a bus going back to our hotel in V Lavender. The bus stop is just across the hotel. So convenient."
,,Nice evening,2.0,,"Spent the day at the zoo and then went for the night safari. Was good, but I have to admit that after the long hot day at the zoo, I fell asleep whilst on the night safari tram.

My wife and kids loved the evening after seeing the different animals.

Was very busy, but staff were organised."
,,Night safari,5.0,,Awsm place... it was awsm experience... a must visit place with family n friends... kids will definitely luv dis place many things go learn 😊
,,A must experience,5.0,,"It's a nice experience don't miss, if you have time try to walk on the trails. By the car it's around 35-40 min. My little one loves it."
,,Love it,5.0,,There is nothing bad to say about this. This is a great attraction that everyone should do in Singapore
,,Great way to see the animals up close,5.0,,"I really liked the fact that the animals are relatively close, both in the tram as when walking. The dark adds an extra dimension also. The animals are more lively also compared to daytime. Especially liked the many wild cats, ranging from lions to civets."
,,Just average ... Can be missed !!,3.0,,"I visited this place coz I read the reviews which claimed it to be brilliant. But trust me people, it is nothing but a tram ride in a open zoo with certain animals. If u want to animals, might as well visit the Singapore zoo and skip the night safari. Just hyped too much !! Kinda waste of money I say."
,,can be seen,4.0,,"Instead of night safari, it could be named night zoo. You can go walking or on road tram. Go early due to huge rush, long lines. If children are not there and you are shortage of time, give a miss. otherwise worth visiting once."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"Everyone said 'you must do the night safari' and they were right!

We had a terrific time. Very well organised with a great variety of animals on show and quite a different experience from the day time zoo trip.

It was busy and we had at least an hour in queues.

Top tip: book the 715pm session and turn up 15-30 mins early.

Favourite moments: the majestic bull elephants."
,,"Perhaps I was expecting something a bit different, easy to get there on MRT/Bus",3.0,,"We had done a lot of walking around during the day and were discussing what to do at night. The Night Safari at the Zoo sounded a bit different but perhaps I hadn't researched carefully enough what it was and was expecting something more like a safari and less like a ride around a zoo at night.
We tried to join a tour from the centre of Singapore but had left it too late for a place on the tour coach that night so decided to go by public transport using our ez-link cards. We paid for our Safari tickets on-line with a discount and got the emailed tickets. The journey was all very straight forward, take the MRT to Ang Mo Kio, walk across the road to the bus interchange and take the 138 to the Zoo. It terminates there so no problem knowing when to get off or catch the bus for the trip back. It took about an hour and like all public transport was good value.
The emailed tickets worked at the entry barriers. We paid for the 8.30pm admission but were allowed in at 8.15, there was a short queue. The safari is taken on road trains along a road past animal enclosures. A disappointing bit was that the commentary was pre-recorded and triggered so often did not coincide with what you could, or more often, couldn't see.
As well as the road train they have footpaths past the animals which were much more enjoyable as you had time to read the information displays and take time to spot the animals which were closer.
We rushed our last part of the walking bit to get back in time for the last show, I wished we hadn't as it was very child entertainment orientated with fairly superficial knowledge all of which I had heard on the safari and read in much more depth on the information boards.
So in summary a pleasant zoo experience, I would vote for spending more time on the walks."
,,Not out-of-the-world but different,3.0,,"It was the first attraction that we visited in Singapore and were excited about it. I had actually imagined an open safari but visited at night. The disappointment was that it was more like a zoo that one visits at night. Still, you don't go to a zoo at night usually hence it is a different experience. And after all, when in Singapore, you have to visit it!"
,,Long Queue for Tickets,3.0,,"OK ""zoo"", but nothing exceptional.

Visited during Tet holiday, maybe this is why the lines for ticket purchase were very long.

The attraction consists of a half-hour train ride round a zoo in the dark with lit exhibits of animals from around the world, not particularly SE Asian. The animals are presented very well, with an illusion of no barriers between the animals and the visitors. It is also possible to walk around the exhibits taking about an hour, but few visitors do this.

There are also a couple of short staged shows run at regular intervals and a good range of food outlets.

Overall, we were underwhelmed."
,,Night time zoo,4.0,,Think this will be more suitable to younger people. The tram ride was good but most o the time is wNdering around
,,With dinner and priority boarding for tram,4.0,,"We'd booked this on recommendation of travel agent.we were pleased we did. Very efficient pick-up at Hotel (I did reconfirm with tour contact when we arrives in Singapore as it had been booked so far in advance and was relieved to get an efficient email back). The buffet dinner was very generous and tasty. The guide on our coach, Roger, had been guiding for 25 years and had a great sense of humour. We saw all sorts of animals, including lions and elephants at close quarters and they were more active than during the day. We still had time to go on a couple of walking trails before returning promptly for the coach. Don't be late they may leave you behind. Singaporeans are efficient and on-time they expect you to be too."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"It was very interesting visit. There are animals out and about but not as many as one might think. You can see more in the Zoo during the day. However, it's still a unique experience."
,,Awesome tour,5.0,,"We booked with skip the line for a tour on Xmas night.
Brilliant - although they were late fetching us from the hotel we bypassed the huge queue and were given a time to meet at a special station for the tour.
The safari was longer than I thought. About 45 mins. We saw lots of animals. Very informative.
The show was brilliant. The serval cat did not want to leave. It was a lesson in not working with animals! Very amusing.
Only one criticism. Why can't the visitors follow simple instructions of no flash photography?
Well done Singapore!
Your night safari is a must do!"
,,great park,5.0,,this is a see when in Singapore. This was a lovely experience to see the animals in this type of environment.
,,An interesting activity,4.0,,"Night Safari in Singapore is not only interesting but also educative, providing information about nocturnal animals. The commentary along the tram ride through the animal habitats is quite informative."
,,Fun night!,4.0,,"I recommend going to night safari. Was tossing up between night safari and river safari but happy I chose the former. Go in early at around 7 and you can see the fire show. 7.15 entry is the best as there's more shows and feeding you can see. Went to a show at 730pm with the keepers and a huge crowd and even got to volunteer to hold a snake on the stage (I'm a 22 year old adult, just raise your hand really high and look enthusiastic!) Some animals were sleeping but others were active and we had fun observing and learning new facts about everyone. Stayed from 7pm-11:30pm and didn't miss a show/walking trail/tram ride on a busy Saturday night. Oh and PLEASE DONT USE FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY. Saw heaps of idiots using flash despite keepers continually telling them not to (not just mainlanders, also lots of Caucasian tourists). Some were also using flash to look into enclosures. Disgusting behaviour. We were told that could potentially blind the poor animals."
,,Night Safari Singapore,4.0,,"The Night Safari, this was a good experience. We got to see animals in such a different setting. We went on the tram which was great. The down side was that it poured down with rain and much of the attractions were cancelled which was a shame."
,,Not as good as the brochure!,3.0,,"Not the easiest venue to travel too.There is no MRT near by so you need to take the MRT to Ang Mokio then catch a 138 bus from the bus station which is opposite the MRT station. The total journey from central Singapore is well over an hour.

Was disappointed with the night safari, though I did see lots of sheep,goats and pigs!"
,,Loved it,5.0,,I loved the night safari though we had to wait a long time due to the Chinese New Year rush. It is informative and seems to be have put together with a lot of love and passion
,,If I knew then what I know now!!!,1.0,,"This night safari was a big fizzer. Too many people, too much queuing and too much waiting and expensive..just an extra way to exhibit the zoo. Had dinner included which was a forgettable experience. Disorganized cattle muster...lots of better things to do in Singapore...half hour drive away from city centre....exhausting!"
,,My first encounter with pandas :-),5.0,,Beautiful spacious zoo with various attractions. Go for the full package entry ticket to experience everything this place has to offer. And stay in for the night safari - it's worth it. My favourite spot were the pandas since I am completely crazy about these adorable animals. :-)
,,Night safari Singapore,3.0,,"Animals shown in the safari are common like tiger, lion, elephants, jackals, deers, bison, etc. The tram ride takes long waiting time & one has to stand in Q for 30-45 min to get the tram. Live show of animals in an open amphitheatre is worth visiting. Live show may be cancelled if it rains which is unpredictable in Singapore."
,,Zoo at night,4.0,,This attraction is bit hyped. I never had a night safari experience so I planned to visit this place. You can see most of the animals in Singapore zoo as well and can see them properly in day time. We just had tram ride and came back. In case you want to have a different experience you can opt for night safari. Otherwise in my opinion Singapore Zoo is enough if you are with kids.
,,Night Safari is sooo good,4.0,,"I'm a big fan of zoo and always visit it anywhere i go, and from several zoos i visited in several countries, i could say that Singapore zoo is the best i ever visited. Very well preserved, they really make it (at least) very similar to those animal's natural habitat, which makes this place is a bit jungle-ish. But it's so nice to walk around here, and wander around those animal's places. There's also somekind of train if you're getting too tired to walk that goes around the place. They also have animal shows, which the crew are so funny and bring up the show in a very good way. Love it, would five stared it if they have probably more seating areas ?"
,,Night time safari,5.0,,I have been in the day it is great but the Night time safari gives you a totally unique experience if you can I would do bot on your next visit to Singapore
,,THIS ONE WAS JUST AN AVERAGE EXPERINCE,3.0,,i had heard many stories about the nighy safari and its wonders ..however i didnt really like this one.. a safari is all about thr experience and thrills u enjoy on the ride.. but this one was too automated.. apart from the fact that you get to see a lot of animal species there is nothing that exciting here.. i enjoyed the fire dance outside more than the ride
,,Unless guided,5.0,,"It was an amazing experience really!

Though food and beverages are expensive, I took a buffet while waiting for the doors to open. Started off my experience with the Fire Performance.

Then I went for the 8.15 show. I thought it was great as the animals were just warmed up. I then took a walk of all the trails looking all the active animals playing with one another. I have to read up on the panels to further understand the fascinating facts of them thus I thought would be better if guided.

There wasn't any feeding times but the tram is very exclusive. It brings you to see the animals up front and personal within reach but was advised not to touch them.

PLEASE DO NOT USE FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY! Many animals were blinded and frightened by them! And yea DO NOT KNOCK! What would you feel if people keep knocking on your bedroom door?"
,,Exciting and Fun & Easy,5.0,,"We just arrived in Singapore and pickup a pamphlet about the Zoo Night Safari since we didn't have dinner plans we book the Dinner with the Night Safari. We were picked up at the hotel at the exact time and taken to a transfer point, from there we joined other going to the Zoo that night. It was Great. No driving trying to find our way around went directly to Zoo. Upon arrival we were escorted passed a large line of people waiting in the queue for tickets. We had a lovely dinner with a large variety of food. Some local dishes and other food we are accustom to in US. Then our guide again escorted us passed another long queue into the Zoo and right to our tram to start our safari. I had just been to South Africa a month ago and did a two day Safari and I saw more animals here than I did in South Africa. We never saw the leopard in Africa and I got a great photo of a Tiger which of course I did not see in Africa. A lot of the night hunters were out and about. When our tram ride was over our guide met us and escorted us to a show. She told us how long the show would last and she gave us an additional half hour before meeting outside at the entrance. When everyone was there she called the bus and we were on our way back to our hotels. How easy was that! I really enjoyed this especially if you are an animal lover."
,,Great family evening out,4.0,,"With a grandparent and two kindergarten kids in tow, we went to the night safari on a Tuesday evening in the early new year.
Luckily we hold an annual pass for the park and along with online booking, we were able to bypass most of the crowds queuing for entrance.
We skipped the show on this occasion and fixed on the 45 minute train drive with audio guide.
With young children, this is as easy as it gets - sitting comfortably and watching the animals with delight.
*Tip - don't sit at the front of the wagon with the window as this actually hinders your view.

The animals and birds (lots of flamingos!) were delightful to watch - and what a variety throughout the 45 minute journey.

If you're considering doing this trip one evening but are hesitant because you have young kids with you - I suggest you get there early, Skip the show and get on one of the first trains.

We had a quick bite to eat afterwards at a burger place which was nice enough although I'm not sure I'd go back again.

We'll be back for another visit to the night safari in a month or two."
,,Ok but expensive,3.0,,Food and drink here is ridiculously priced. I must admit it was hard to see some of the animals at night and i must admit i thought it would be better. The animal show at the end was ok.
,,Good but better for children.,4.0,,"We went on the tram ride and went to see a show. The tram ride was about 45 minutes and the show was 30 minutes. My girlfriend wanted to go but I'd say this is better for kids. The tram ride brings you pretty close to the animals while driving through the park. Closer than I thought I'd be. Some of the animals were further away or couldn't be seen. There is also an optional walking trail.

Many tourists were talking and making a lot of noise which I didn't care for. Some also wouldn't listen to the non-flash photography rule. It was okay but I think children would enjoy it more.

I would say the same goes for the show. The show host will greet everyone after being seated and begin the show. Trainers will come out with animals and walk through the seating area. A few guest volunteers will go up on stage and participate. Again, I'd say better for children."
,,Pre-purchase tickets directly from zoo!!,4.0,,"Do not purchase tickets from Voyagin. We bought tickets to the 7pm session from Voyagin and arrived to find that the 7.15 and 8.15 sessions were sold out and that we would have to wait until 9.15. I found the information on the Voyagin website deceptive as they allow you to book into a session time but do not explain that it doesn't mean that you are guaranteed a spot at that time.
It takes a couple of hours to see the animals, and then it is a fair distance to travel back to the city centre so be prepared for a late night!"
,,Roaring!,4.0,,"Fantastic experience. We enjoyed the evening very much and the sound of the Lion roaring in the evening through the night, seeing him roar from Lion lookout will never be forgotten. Sorry we missed his feeding time. There is a lot to do so plan a long evening and would highly recommend the first session time of 7.15pm as we did the 8.15pm and we finished about 11pm, really enjoyed that sleep in as it was about an hour to get back to our hotel in Clarke Quay. As much as I enjoyed this I still enjoyed the day time zoo far more and would recommend travellers do both. Enjoy!"
,,Morrisb,3.0,,Unfortunately we visited on a very wet night(having pre↙booked). Although the train operated in the rain and we saw the animals the shows were cancelled. Advice is to book when the weather is good.
,,Great architecture,4.0,,Well kept city streets. Lots of shopping and unique skyline Felt safe. Great food variety. Friendly city
,,Face to Face with Nature,4.0,,The night safari was one of my favorite activities on my Singapore trip. Many of the animals are active and you come face to face them...or at least get the sensation you are. One area had bats flying around our heads! I especially enjoyed walking through and seeing the big cats and other animals in the large enclosures. It felt like they could get you. At one point they had otters and the otters hoped out of the water and onto the riverbank and waved at me! It was an excellent experience I would gladly go again.
,,Exiting nigth,4.0,,It is exiting seeing the animals in darknes. It is a really good experience with value for money. We went there and had a good dinner before a tram trip around the zoo. There are plenty of animals quite near the tram.
,,The same zoo but at night !!,5.0,,I went and was expecting more than taking me a night tour in the singapore zoo which is the same zoo i went to at the same day preciously !! The show i attended was poor and not up to standard the life animal show they only taking some animals out and showing them to the audience with some talking .. for me it was ok to only fill the schedule of the day. But i wont go again.
,,We did the night safari that was crowded but fun.,5.0,,"The night safari and the FIRE show before that is very popular and very good.
Book ahead the tickets for the night safari or else you will end up standing in the line for over 30 minutes.
The entrance to the night safari at your designated time involves u to wait for another 60 minutes.
After that u have to run to pick what u want to do and some attractions like the bird show which was not that good but they closed due to space limitations.
so plan ahead what u want to see in the night safari.

The river walk is not very impressive, long walk, no proper directions and nothing very interesting to see.
several aquariums etc in united sates are much better,so this did not appeal much.

Finding a cab after the show was a nightmare with kids who were tired, however the ZOO officials were helping out the tourists in every way possible to find a conveyance.
OVERALL a good visit."
,,Night safari at the Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo.
It was fantastis and that's why I say that it's a nice thing to do on a hot day.
Of course it's nice with children.
We stayedin the Ramada Inn hotel and we went with a taxi, 20-30 dollar one way."
,,Fun night,5.0,,"If you are going to the Night Safari, suggest you book your ticket online to save you some $.

We were looking forward to watching the fire show at the entrance but, to our disappointment, it was not available during that period we were there and nothing was me mentioned on the website either.

There are some educational exhibits before entering the Night Safari. We arrived about half an hour before the Night Safari opened, yet there was already a queue to enter.

We decided to have dinner at the Bongo Burgers whilst waiting for the crowd to clear instead of joining the queue.

Upon entering, we were unsure if we should take the tram first or watch the show first. The staff advised us to head for the Creatures of the Night show first though we had just missed one. We were the first to queue for this show, this we could select the choicest seats.

Very interesting and entertaining show. A must see if you are at the Night Safari.

After the show, we took the tram and got off at various stops to further explore the walking trails.

Be prepared with appropriate walking shoes.

You might not be able to see all the animals, but you do get to see quite a number.

Take your time to explore the area. Follow the maps for a good guide around."
,,Night animals,3.0,,"Tram and animal show were ok to good. Logistics of tickets and getting around are poor. Get there before the 7:15 pm open or you will have all long lines. We got lucky with a person who uses a cane and they gave us priority everywhere.

The walking trails were better because the fishing cats and otters were very active--the only animals that were. Don't expect to get many good pictures because of the darkness and no flash allowed."
,,Amazing night attraction in singapore,4.0,,"A fun tram ride inside the night safari park, offers great views of various wildlife animals. A fun to do activity."
,,Night Zoo is Great,4.0,,We visited the zoo at night and took the tram ride through the park. Very enjoyable visit and quite unique when compared to a normal daytime visit. Fun for the whole family!
,,Bus trip from centre,5.0,,"IDisney type organisation
Once you get used to this rather different style of visit excellent
You can see an amazing range of animals close up
SFari train very good but does not really pause for long enough
40 minutes ride
Walk ways worth doing
Children's show good if never been to anything like it before"
,,Long day,4.0,,We did both the river safari and the night safari but as it thundered we could not do the river safari as not safe when thunder and lightening. As such was quite a lot of hanging about so ended up a long day. The night safari was good although no pictures could be taken
,,Incredibly busy,3.0,,"I love zoos and was so excited about this especially after reading the reviews. Unfortunately we went a few days after Chinese new year and it was super busy. It took ages to get in and no chance of doing the tram ride especially as we were on the buses and therefore limited time wise. We made the best of it by walking the trails which I would highly recommend. It took us about 2 hours to walk through the trails and that was at a steady pace, we got to see lots of the animals up close. We did the wallaby and bat walk through but too scared to do the flying squirral one.
Sadly there is two main buses which go to the zoo which are quite infrequent and stop at 12ish which isn't suitable as the zoo closes at midnight.
Would recommend this but avoid busy holidays as it means you will be queuing loads. We ended up missing the tram ride and the shows were full"
,,Not worth the money and distance,2.0,,"This was such a disappointing trip, too much money spend not only in taxi fees to get there but also for what we got to see. Because we wanted to skip the long lines at the ticket box we booked and payed our tickets online. We were given a slot to enter the park. Making sure not to miss out on anything, we arrived at the gates 2 hours before our actual scheduled time. We wanted to grab a bite to eat before starting the tour. But there were so many people that it took us that 2 hours to just get into the park at our allocated time slot. Becasue of overcrowding we had to wait in lone lines to see the animal show and to get to ride the guided ride. This was such a shamed because we ended up not even seeing half the park before we were asked to started exiting the park a half and hour before the advertised closing time. We went all the way, spend all that money and only got to see half of it, because of crowing we could'nt even enjoy the fire breathers show. The park is stunning and the animals very interesting to experience at night. But due to the park taking and allowing for number of visitors to enter, many people left complaining. I guess this is what greed does, they make their money and don;t really care if the visitors fully enjoy what they paid for. Afterwards we had to wait for quite some time for a taxi to arrive. The food was also not worth it, huge portions but absolutely tasteless. We tried the burger joint to the left of the gate entrance. We could've definitely enjoyed other attractions in Singapore than to have wasted our precious time at this place."
,,Skip it and go to the Zoo instead,3.0,,Disappointing. Creature show is tacky. Lots of animals hidden/sleeping. Hard to see them at night. Not as many animals as the zoo. Go to the zoo instead.
,,Wonderful Guided Tour,5.0,,Many thanks to Night Safari / Singapore Zoo volunteer Nur for the excellent guided tour afforded to Myself and my Nephew recently. I booked the classic night tour and was met by Nur at the reception counter who then escorted us to reserved seating for the Creatures of The Night Show which was educational light hearted and well paced. From there it was into our private buggy and Nur as our expert guide and driver took us on an unforgettable tour. Nur has been with the Singapore Zoo and knows the history of most of the animals and was passionate and incredibly giving of his knowledge and answered any questions we had. The Classic Tour is a great way to experience this wonderful attraction and well worth the money. Thank you Night Safari for arranging the tour on short notice and please pass on my personal appreciation to Nur for giving up his time and making our night both memorable and magical.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Myself and my family loved this place. What a different experience it was amazing going around seeing the animals at night and they all come alive at night. The staff were so friendly and welcoming as there was one man who was feeding the animals and he was so knowledgable telling us so many interesting facts about the animals. We even learnt some of the animals names. We definately recommend doing this when you are in Singapore this was number 1 on our list.
,,Intersting concept !,3.0,,"It's different however not so different the day time experience much much better and better value .. not cheap not so exciting, time limited , mosquitoes in abundance , children tired after a long day , also expensive ... give it a miss , or send the kids with a babysitter and go enjoy a nice dinner in the city !"
,,Very Good,4.0,,"If you love seeing nocturnal animals then this is a must.
The pathways are well laid out & the animals are abundant.
I would recommend going on the first tour at opening (around 7.15) as it gets packed & also they start feeding the animals then so you are more likely to see them.
You start with a show in the amphitheater & then que for the tram ride which can take ages.
We found it better to walk around the pathways before going on the tram as they are deserted while everyone else is on the tram & then you can ride that from another stop later on."
,,Crowded and disappointing when could have been great,3.0,,"We visited the Night Safari on Sunday night of Chinese New Year. Yes this is a busy time of year But the way this was managed was very disappointing. We arrived late for our booked 7.15 tour because we mis-timed the bus. The bus takes 40 minutes from the train station, allow for this in your planning. The 8.15 tour was sold out so we waited for the 9.15. At 8.45 a crowd of about 500 people descended on the Entry line. By the time we realised what was going on we were miles back in line. And there were many others behind us. There were so many people we didn't get through the gate until 9.45, only to then have to queue up for at least another half an hour to get the tram. So our tour started a whole hour after the booked entry time. At no time were we told this could be the case. We had children aged 7-12 with us. If we had known this we wouldnt have purchased the 9.15 tickets.

The safari recommends you get off the tram and take the trails to see more of the animals. But because it was so busy the trams did not stop. We wanted to see the Leopard trail but from the one and only tram stop it was a 30 minute walk to the start of the trail. By this time it was 10.45 which was too late.

The actual safari itself was great. Ticket sales should be reduced to about one third of the current levels. The over-crowding made the whole experience very unpleasant and we are extremely disappointed we did not get to experience it properly."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"This is a unique kind of experience which you would have never seen or experienced anywhere else. Seeing animals including some free roaming animals during night is a wonderful experience. May be due to this, it's always crowded.

It's thrilling to go and see them by walk. Later you can take tram for a 30-40 mins guided tour. The animal show is also nice and you need to go early to get a seat. The fireshow at the entrance is awesome too. You can get something to eat/drink and watch the show.

We can always combine Night Safari with Zoo or River Safari, if you have the stamina."
,,Must do,5.0,,"We loved night safari, it's amazing! It is so organized staff are really good, just wonderful it gets up close to all the animals , we enjoyed it so much, the show after was good, the restaurants were really nice, souvenir shops, can't wait to visit again."
,,Night visits are spectacular,5.0,,Creatures that are normally timid and shy come out to play in the evenings. Well worth the visit. See some magnificent animals up close.
,,Great!!! But tooooooooo busy.......,4.0,,"Busy, busy, busy.
I went to this attraction about 10 years ago and while I am happy I returned it wasnt as good an experience for me as I had remembered.  I think it was mostly due to the crowds.  Lots of people talking VERY LOUDLY.  By skipping the tram and walking the trails I thought (like last time) i could avoud this.  Nope. 
All the loud talking takes away from the night experience.  As well, there are all these high power and LOUD fans installed at many of the viewing areas which really ruins the atmosphere as well.  There are of course lots of things to see, various cats, hyenas, and many smaller nocturnal creatures which may take a moment or two to notice but with some patience you find them.  The walking paths are well done, not lit up too much.
So, my opinion is that when purchased as a combined ticket with the day time zoo it is worth the cash and time.  Go as late as you can as the crowds were really thinning around 11.  There is lots to see, but maybe bring earplugs."
,,Well done,5.0,,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed the Night Safari. The trolley takes you around and tells you about the animals. Then, walk around the paths to see the animals at your our pace."
,,Different experience,4.0,,"We went as part of a tour with the transport to and from our hotel included and dinner.

We had a bus pick us from the hotel and then drop us in Chinatown where we waited with a bunch of other people from various tour groups to be sorted into the right bus. This took a bit of a while however understand the process and see the efficiency of it.

We then boarded our bus and had a wonderful guide with us explaining things along the way and making jokes.

We had 50 minutes for the buffet dinner. There were enough options for a vegetarian which was good.

We got to skip the long lines and boarded the tram with our group for the safari. It was nice seeing the animals in a different light. Also much better than walking around the zoo in the heat during the day so a great alternative. It was nice to see animals without cages.

After the Safari we lined up and saw a show which was pretty entertaining. Then we regrouped and went back to our coach for the ride back to our hotels. There was no time to really buy any souvenirs which is probably a good thing.

The travel time was quite long compared to the time you actually spend at the safari in my opinion however it is a great experience if you don't have much else to fill your time with in Singapore."
,,Ok,3.0,,yes it's different - but that's about all. A little overpriced considering you ride in a huge car and can't really see anything. I really can't recommend it unless you are really looking for something else to do.
,,So much fun!,5.0,,"We opted for the night safari as we have done the whole zoo thing and wanted to try something different.We were initially picked up from our hotel and the tour began with dinner in the zoo restaurant which was nice and had a variety from Indian to Chinese.Straight after this we went to see the fire show.I have never seen anything like it,I was left speechless at certain points.You could feel the heat from where we were standing in the audience!Perfect way to start the tour.Afterwards we boarded the train,and I believe this is where the real magic began.The train drove through the night,stopping at certain points and showing the animals in their natural habitats.From the sights to the sounds and smells,the whole experience was just surreal.I often felt like I was partaking in a tour in South Africa.Just magnificent.The train was hop on hop off,so we were given the option to leave the train at certain points,if we wished to complete the rest of the tour by foot.overall it is a must-see if you are visiting Singapore,and really will make your whole trip.Such a unique and spell binding experience!"
,,Great Outing!,5.0,,"We did the Night Safari on New Year's Day. Since I had read that we would likely need to take a cab home after the tour was over, I decided to take a professional tour which I purchased from Viator. This worked out really well as they picked us up at the hotel, we had priority entrance with no real waiting and they dropped us off at the hotel.

The Safari was fun and I enjoyed the tram ride and seeing the animals up close. Since it was raining, there was no evening show and we got to walk one of the trails. This was actually better than a shoe as we got to spend more time looking at the animals.

We did not take the dinner option with our tour as I had hoped to eat before we left for the tour. This didn't happen but it was OK as there is plenty of food on the site. After we walked the trail we had enough time to eat dinner. I found the Chinese food option was reasonably priced for the location, tasty, and freshly prepared. It was also a lot lower in price than the dinner option.

Overall we had an enjoyable time and would recommend it to others."
,,Great Attraction but Poor service,2.0,,"Visited the Night Safari on Chinese New Year eve.. so not visited by locals but mostly tourists.
It wasnt as crowded given its a public holiday eve..
The Singapore Zoo and Night Safari is an icon even for us Singaporeans, we are proud of its standing as a very unique and only one in the world night time viewing of the nocturnal animals.
But what saddened me is being let down by extremely poor service by one particular staff called Luqman.
Whilst waiting for the Tram and we were waiting pretty orderly.. he raised his voice to tell us to move to another line and i was with my dad and wife and we were with our 2 and a half yr old child.
It was totally unnecessary as noone was shoving or being unorderly.
I would have shouted back at the Luqman dude but my dad stopped me.

I seriously hope the Night safari looks into training their staff to handle crowds better as well as having staff to be trained to be smiling and not given stoned looks.

Just think Singapore Airlines and please learn from them.

Have attached a photo of the rude staff Luqman."
,,Much too crowded,2.0,,"We went there early, but still had to queue up for 45 minutes. Tickets are issued for certain entry times... Which does not help much, because of course those who enter first do not leave again first - which is, why the place becomes more and more crowded and therefore noisy. I suspect the reason why you see so many animals anyway is, that the enclosures are much too small to find a hiding place. The malayan flying fox (biggest existing ""bat"") almost cannot avoid to touch you when flying... I felt pity for the animals."
,,Lovely Experience,4.0,,"Since we had kids with us, we did not take any of the walking trails and stuck to the 40 minute tram ride. It was interesting to see animals in the dark and the large one that walked alongside for a while was fun for the kids."
,,worth a visit,4.0,,We visited the night safari on a seperate day to the zoo and combined it with the buffet dinner. We appreciated the cooler weather in the evening and saw many animals up close from the free tram ride through the park. We watched both shows and the kids particularly enjoyed the creatures of the night show. Well worth a visit!
,,Not a must,3.0,,"Was not impressed by the night safari. We waited for ages to access the park, it was a good experience, but did not worth the amount of time wasted waiting. In my opinion going to the River safari would have probably been a better choice"
,,Fantastic attraction,4.0,,"We just went on a tram ride to see the animals. Unfortunately did not walk the trails as it was raining but worth a visit. Even the show was nice, one time visit."
,,first safari,4.0,,"Husband planned a visit to the night safari and decided on the personal tour to avoid the long lines. Tour guide was excellent. We rode in a buggy through the park and the guide was very knowledgable about the animals.

We went during the height of the Zika scare which probably wasn't the best idea."
,,Fantastic night tour,5.0,,Great to experience zoo by night on the tram. Felt like you could almost touch the animals. Great experience!
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Took our two children (7,9) who absolutely loved this trip! It was clean, easy to get to from our hotel by cab and well-organised when we arrived. The tram tour was great and the boys enjoyed walking the trails to find all kinds of animals which they could see close up. As it is a night tour the heat was not a problem and it was not at all crowded when we visited. A must do for a family trip to Singapore!!"
,,Impressive!,5.0,,Definitely recommend a visit to the Night Safari - the only one of its kind in the world. Don't just rely on the tram ride to see the animals. Walk the trails and you'll see an awful lot more.
,,Quite Disappointing,2.0,,We could hardly see the animals. The trail walk was just ok. The show was ok but not worth the time.- The host of the show was good though. Maybe vising the zoo during the day would be better option.
,,Top tourist attraction,4.0,,Night Safari is one of the top tourist attraction where you get near to see the animals. Better take tram and do walking as too humid
,,Fun Fun Fun,4.0,,"Absolutely fun! it’s night safari so you’d basically only see nocturnal animals. Nevertheless, I had a great time. The Safari show was quite entertaining and I enjoined going around the tram. My mom fell asleep though..."
,,Good thing for a few hours on a slow night,4.0,,The Night Safari was a good time. The tour was good and walking around enabled us to get up close to more of the animals. The heat wasn't too much better than during the day though. There are a few shows that were interesting. Overall a good activity.
,,A different take on the traditional Zoo,5.0,,"When planning our Singapore trip we decided to skip the Zoo as we'd done so many during our travels. When we learned about the Night Safari, we were intrigued and booked.

We were coming from Santosa Island - and it's quite a trek. We started thinking we could make it in an hour and a half using the public transport directions... while we would have eventually got there, during peak hour we would have needed more than the time we had so we hopped in a cab and traveled the rest of the way.

We had a 7:15 time slot for entry but didn't arrive till 7:25pm. Counters 3 & 4 were taking e-vouchers, this line took 25 minutes, to get our tickets. I was a little disappointed, thinking that we'd need to wait till 8:15pm, but we were waved straight through.

We opted for the tram ride first, the line was long, but moved quickly. I think it was about a 20 minute wait. Our tram was packed full and even though the staff asked people to keep noise to a minimum - our trip was filled with excited squeals. When walking around the park later, the trams were virtually empty, the trip looked a lot more serene (and the later tram trip would have allowed us to sea more shows). Regardless of how full the tran was, the trip was great. We only had 2 ""no shows"" (animals), we saw loads of animals and quite close, some were even on road, changing paddocks. There was a insightful recorded narration with information about the animals and their relation to Singapore. There is NO flash photography permitted but photos and video was allowed.

After our tram ride, we queued for the ""Creatures of the Night"" show, we queued for around 30 minutes to ensure ourselves a seat, it allowed us to get a great seat. I can't speak highly enough of this show, the presenter made my night, he was engaging, humorous and educational. The staff stayed calm even when everything didn't go to plan - they were just amazing. After the show there was opportunity for photos with a few of the animal stars - so stick around right to the end.

Because of the timing of our tram ride and the Creatures of the Night show - we didn't get to see any others.

After the show let out we walked all the walking trails, had plenty of extra photo ops and were able to watch the Hyenas playing after their feeding - it was priceless.

We exited the park at 11:40pm, the park closed at 12 midnight. The one complication with that is the bus service that would get us back to our accommodation had stopped, so we needed to catch a cab back.

The park itself was immaculate, the staff were amazing and the animals were fantastic.

If I had to give any advice it would be leave plenty of time if traveling via public transport. Have a ""plan b"" if you linger in the park and your service has terminated... and don't feel the need to rush to the tram - take in the shows, walk the trails and take the tram later in night for a quieter more relaxing trip.

When booking try the site ""Voyagin"" we were able to get discounted tickets here with instant eVoucher."
,,Unique experience!,4.0,,"I really enjoyed this! You got to seem many animals that were either more active than they would be during the day or visible when they would otherwise be not seen at all. We did the tram as well as all four walking trails and enjoyed them all! I found the animals easy to see and the tram ride was informative and had a good, conservation message. The areas for the animals along the tram route were very open and integrated rather than looking like enclosures - some animals were almost within touching distance of the tram as they ranged wherever they want. The walking trails allowed for a quieter, more leisurely experience and viewing of different animals. Didn't attend the show, so can't comment on that. The best deal is to buy combination tickets - you don't even have to go on the same day (which makes for a long, tiring day) and Uber is the easiest and best value way to get there."
,,Always bring my family here when they visit,5.0,,"I am an expat living in Singapore and it's often difficult to think of places to bring out-of-town guests. However, I never fail to being my family to the Night Safari (I have been 4 times already!). The Safari is especially good for guests who may not be accustomed to Singapore's sweltering heat. The tram ride makes this park well worth the price of admission and is great for little kids. My niece had a great time (although it was getting quite late for a toddler)."
,,Not worth the extra fee for night time,2.0,,"Booked this tour with Far East Tours and It had been raining, traffic was extremely bad and a 40 minute trip took one and half hours so we didn't get to the zoo until 7.45pm. Our guide directed us straight to the tram ride and even though we had priority tickets there was still a 15 min wait to board. The tram didn't stop long enough at any one point and most animals were hard to see, by time this finished we were too late to see the last of the other two shows we were booked to see do missed out on those as well as the bus was departing st 10pm sharp. I would have thought they could of extended it even 30 mins so we could see the last show seeing as we were so delayed in getting there.
Overall it was disappointing and I would recommend going in daylight hours, you will see more."
,,Great Idea but Average,3.0,,"When it was time to go to our Safari the question of how to get there occurred. I did not realise it was in a rural destination, approx half an hour from Marina Bay, and for ease we chose to travel by taxi, which cost $70 return.

My 12 and 17 year old enjoyed the Night Safari, but my husband and I were disappointed that there was not more variety of animals."
,,But Where Are the Animals ???,1.0,,"Forget it ... What a waste of time, very crowded, Food & Drinks overpriced. Only seen a couples of animals . other are just INVISIBLE ! The show is not too bad ..."
,,Underwhelmed given all the hype beforehand,3.0,,We were a bit underwhelmed I guess given how many people told us we had to go and see it... we were probably expecting more. It was ok and the tram ride was interesting. The show only went for about 15 mins and that was disappointing... we waited longer in the line than the show went for! Worth doing once.
,,A must!,5.0,,My wife insists that we go to this every time we visit Singapore. It is something to do at least once and is unusual in itself. It always brings a smile to my face when I think about it. You can take an organised tour by coach or be more independent and get a taxi. Nice when you get there and relaxing. You can walk around and jump on and off the train. The kids will love it although you will struggle to see some of the animals
,,Amazing,5.0,,It is a nice chance to not just enjoy and marvel at this place but also to educate yourself and children about animal care as in their show they make sure to tell you what should or should not be done to animals. A must. Try to avoid weekends. The crowds are better and more managable weekdays.
,,An unforgettable experience,5.0,,I thoroughly enjoyed this Safari it was a surreal experience. Well organised and even though the queues were long they moved at a quick pace.
,,Like to see a zoo of a different kind,5.0,,You will enjoy the open tram ride that takes you through a range of animal habitats in their natural form. Amazing collection of animals from the very large to the very small.
,,Well put together,4.0,,"It was nicely done and if you go on the 4 walking trails as opposed to taking the tram then it's a peaceful walk away from the crowds.
Would definitely make a day out of it and get the 4 parks pass to make the money worthwhile"
,,"Enjoyed,great atmosphere,must see attraction",4.0,,The only regret we have about visiting was we ran out of time. We spent an hour and a half here and it wasn't long enough. The ride through the enclosures with great descriptions of the animals was fantastic as were the trails you could walk to explore more. It's not a cheap attraction but enjoyable.
,,Fun,5.0,,Fun. Cool mist in air. Feels like a kid again. Clean but slightly humid..tolerable. stay hydrated prior tour. Have fun
,,Nighttime Treat.,4.0,,"The Night Safari is definitely worth going on, along with the Zoo. You get to witness the animals in their natural habitats and some of them in their prime nocturnal activities. It's worth it!"
,,Save your money do something else!,1.0,,"Was overpriced and expensive in general but everyone had said how good it was but it was honestly terrible! So they left you go to the water river safari but over half of it is closed, granted it's free but it's a long walk for nothing basically.. anyway I was early for my slot and there was a free for all for the time slot before, literally hundreds of people pushing and shoving. And it was so hot. They kept turning people away with my time slot but it turned out they queued up and got in anyway. I started queuing half an hour beforehand and I was in that queue for over an hour, being pushed about and hardly moving, it was worse than herding cattle. Then the next amazing part we were to that the show was full and so was the next one so that we couldn't do the show, so the only thing to really do was the tram tour, - queued for another hour, packed in like sardines and so hot that somebody passed out. The trams weren't being organised properly and half of them were going half empty, an absolute joke, when we did finally get on a tram they tried to put more people I refused to be squashed after spending two hours with no personal space. The tour itself was rubbish, the lighting on the animals was shocking, half of the spaces were empty so they kept skipping over the pre-recorded guide, the ones that were there were driven past so quickly. Some people hadn't waited for the tour and walked round it but as someone on there own the idea of walking around in the dark having no map and no idea what animals were where I wasn't going to! The worst part was there was nothing else to do there, the shops were so overpriced - $15 dollars for a large soft drink in one of them! Then the public transport according to google stops around 10:30, I managed to jump on a backed bus and get out of there. My advice don't waste your money or your time/effort getting there (it's away from the city). I don't know if the zoo is any better but at those prices maybe don't risk it despite it being highly recommended to me by a few people."
,,Don't bother with this! There are better ways to see animals in the wild around Bali and Indonesia,1.0,,"Silly tourist trap with queues for hours to see nothing but a few sheep, goats, cows and maybe a glimpse of a lion and hyenas! For the price you pay and for the wait there are better things to do and see in Singapore!"
,,Disappointed,3.0,,Very pricey. Some of the animals were not in the surrounds and the rhinos looked like they were dead ( although they weren't! ). The carriage ride was hot and the zoo grounds were extemely smelly. Very disappointing!
,,well worth the trip,4.0,,"Over a hour trip on open top tour bus,lots of tourists, had three of my grandchildren with us ,traveled around on tour carts, for over one hour ,what a magic tour ,all types on animals to be seen"
,,Top list for visitors and families,5.0,,"Whenever I have friends visiting from abroad, Night Safari will always be my first choice to bring them. The animal show is a MUST watch."
,,Public transport isn't that great.,4.0,,Getting to the Night Safari isn't really possible with public transport unless you're willing to spend 2hrs on it. Rather take a taxi (which is costly if you're alone or going back home after mid-night - due to 50% extra). Nevertheless quite an interesting concept to have.
,,"Not-To-Be Missed, Rainforest Preserve within the city",5.0,,"The Night Safari is built into a real nature reserve, encompassing a reservoir, virgin rain forest and covering some 86 acres. But this being Singapore, the whole area is well-planned, plotted, laid-out, convenient and clean. You won't even encounter a mosquito here, and unless you go off-trail, you're unlikely to come across any snakes or scary critters. But you will see lots of animals, all carefully kept in sections that resemble their natural habitat. From elephants to lions to deer to wild boars to otters, this is a diverse open-air zoo and you can explore it in comfort by a winding tram with a guide, or get off and walk through the trails. The whole park is lit by special lamps that resemble moonlight so as not to disturb the animals, many of whom are nocturnal, but it's bright enough for visitors to see the animals.
Here are my recommendations:
- Avoid weekends as the crowds can be huge and the lines long. Go on a weekday and go early (the park opens at 7pm)
- Buy your tickets online at the Night Safari website and save yourself the hassle of standing in line and save some money as they give a 10% discount for online purchases
- Do not eat at the park restaurants. The foods is outrageously overpriced and not very good. East before you go and bring some snacks and drinks
- Take the tram first to get a feel of the park and use the free map to know where you are. But do get off and walk as well, because you'll see more and can take your time to explore.
- Make sure you visit the flying fox and bat enclosure, where you can see these amazing huge bats up close, hanging upside down on tree branches and eating fruits. They are fascinating and beautiful.
- If you are visiting during the rainy season, bring an umbrella and good shoes but don't wear a raincoat. With high humidity, you will melt inside anything that is not breathable."
,,A bit dissapointed.,2.0,,"I had high hopes of a quality addition to the Singapore Zoo and was looking forward to finding out how they had solved the problem of watching animals in the dark. Unfortunately, they hadn't with quite often no more than a vague dark shape in the jungle visible during the tram ride through the park. The exhibits along the walking trails gave a somewhat better opportunity for watching the not quite wildlife but all in all I was left disappointed by this attraction."
,,"Excellent family experience, well done",5.0,,"I pre-booked this trip on the internet and chose the hotel pick-up, dinner and ""no-wait"" for tram option. The food was great and we were served in a private area with less crowds. We then boarded our tram without waiting in a long line and enjoying the peaceful night of animal viewing. It was a great experience start to finish for my family."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,To see so many different animals so active in the darkness was magical. The Zoo come to life after dark - don't miss it.
,,Enjoy the walking trails,4.0,,"Nice visit but very crowded....tram ride was just okay. We enjoy the self guide walking trails and missed the last show. I think not too good for young children, zoo is probably better for young kids."
,,Nocturnal delight,5.0,,"If you've not been to a night zoo, you must go to this one. It's well-designed, well-maintained and restful. Both the tram ride and walking trails were very enjoyable and not too taxing. Directions were easy to follow and there were few mosquitoes despite the lush vegetation. There's food and snacks if you get hungry, both at the entrance and halfway through at a tram stop. It can get warm and humid even though it's night when you're there. If you can catch a glimpse of the reservoir, you'll be enthralled. For those who can't see well in the dark, it can be quite trying though, peering in the darkness. Sometimes I can't 'see' the creatures unless they move."
,,Make it worth it,3.0,,"All though enjoyable, a litter diss appointed compared to night safari in Bali , but was still worth it , maybe do the zoo in late afternoon and stay for night safari , I wouldn't go just for night safari , make sure you watch all the shows"
,,Must do! Nice experience,5.0,,"We started with the show were some animals are presented. After that we took the train that tooks us around and explained what we were seeing. The animals are very very close to us so although there was no light we could see them.
After that we walk the paths to complete the visit.
Advise: try to book for early entrance because some shows are not late. You can have dinner before getting into the park."
,,So much fun,5.0,,This is the best zoo so far. The place is so big that it took us almost the whole day to visit all the animals. They have a tram that will take you around the zooin case you get tired walking. We also enjoyed the feedings and shows specially the ones with the elephants. Kids learned so much and it was a good experience for all of us. They have the night safari and water safari so we have to go back for those.
,,Saturday night visit,4.0,,"Visited the night safari last week. It was very crowded! the tram shows you the majority of animals and it takes about an hour. walking trails show the rest. It was fun, but seems rather expensive for the experience. Might be boring for young children because the animals can be hard to spot."
,,Fun night,4.0,,"It has been a decade since I last visited the Night Safari and it was still great fun.
We opted for discounted tickets to the 9.15pm session. This was great as the 7pm sessions were booked out by families with young children and very crowded. The later session enabled us to get straight on the second train and head off. We later explored two walking trails, making it an 11.30pm finish. Getting back to town was not a problem as there were lines of taxis. Our ride cost $20. This was a big contrast to the $80 uber fare city to zoo - this was because we were travelling outward in heavy traffic on a Friday night when there is stiff competition for cabs and über s. be sure to leave enough time to get to the zoo for your allotted visit time."
,,An experience worth every penny!!,5.0,,"The Night Safari was on our agenda from the second we set our sights on Singapore. We found the people in Singapore extremely disciplined, but we never thought the animals there, would follow suit too!!..Amazing Experience,enthralling tram commentary. Must must visit, especially for a wildlife lover."
,,Memorable Night Adventure,4.0,,"We visited as a family of four (2 young children aged 9 and 4). The whole experience of observing the animals in the dark within their natural surroundings was quite memorable. With the prior booking of tickets for the Zoo, Bird Park, River Safari and Night Safari together, through the internet, the entrance was hassle free.
The queue for the tram was longer than expected but at last, we were on the tram. It takes around 45 minutes to complete the tour. The guide instructs you about the dos and don'ts beforehand, so do listen carefully (do not use flash for the camera as the animals are quite close sometimes and get startled with the blinding light). The tour gives you glimpses of the creatures of the night very closely.
After the tour, you have many restaurants to choose from, for dinner. A fire dance show, conducted by the artists, was a treat to watch.

Tip: Be on time. Early the better.
It is always better to choose the earliest safari time if you are commuting through public transportation for going back to your hotel,.
If you have booked all the parks then it's better to cover River safari, Zoo and Night safari in one day and the Bird park can be covered on the other day.
With young children always opt for tram rather than walking as it is night time.
Carry your cameras, water bottles and insect repellent."
,,A Neat Experience,5.0,,"This is a really nice way to see many nocturnal animals that are normally sleeping during the day on zoo visits. We used RMG to pick us up at the hotel and take us there. They were a little slow on the pick up but was worth it since we were able to jump a long queue onto the tram ride. Bus back to city was punctual and dropped us back at hotel.

Really liked the time to do the 3 walking loops (about an hour) to spend more time with the animals then the team provided"
,,A Bit Hard to See the Animals,3.0,,We went on the Night Safari and it was a bit difficult to see the animals in the dim lights. We did enjoy the animal show that they had with some animals we were unfamiliar with.
,,Lovely,4.0,,"We had previously been to Singapore Zoo and decided to visit the Night Safari this visit. The fire show prior to 7pm
Entrance was fantastic. The Creatures of the night wonderful and very informative. We did the show first and then jumped aboard the shuttle to tour around the park, lastly walking the numerous trails to see the animals up close and personal. Glad we did the shuttle as got to see a majority of the animals, when walking they had decided to rest and hide."
,,Cool,4.0,,"We had a ticket for the zoo the river safari and the night safari.
The best thing you can do is when you arrive at the zoo around 3 p.m then you can do everything at one time.
Taxi to and from the city is about 20 SD
Great place to spend time"
,,Must see!,5.0,,Visit Singapore for already many years but this was the first time visiting the Night Safari. It's worth every penny! Btw on time because it's always very busy. You can spend the whole evening visiting this place. Just plan your visit and you will be suppressed!
,,A nice tram ride,4.0,,"Ugly line, but when it moved it went really fast. Also those waiting on line were treated to a duo of fire Ask for handicap entry if needed. Wonderful staff. Seeing the bull elephants was a treat. 1000% better than River Safari rip off. Very good education during the ride. Two stops for walkers which we skipped but those who went seemed to enjoy it. If in Singapore for fun do this after the zoo. They are side by side"
,,Great Show,4.0,,"This show proceeded by fire eaters, and performers make for a very entertaining evening. Line up for this show was unbelievable"
,,just ok,2.0,,"yes its at night time, makes it harder to see the animals. and adds nothing that you might have seen at other zoo's safari's , probably wouldnt bother especially with so many great things to spend your hard earned on in singapore.."
,,Night Amusement,4.0,,Night Safari offers u to witness the wild life of various animals. Kids 'll be too amused by it. Before entering you 'll be able to witness a mind blowing fire show by Zumboooo brothers .. NIce show ..
,,Average tourist activity,3.0,,If you have limited time in Singapore then this activity can be avoided . All domesticated animals with no great thrills.
,,Re-visit after many years.,4.0,,"Took a taxi from our city hotel as we were advised that bus or MRT would take much longer. Reasonable price for the trip & delivered right to the zoo entrance. Just had to decide on the zoo, night safari or river safari but we'd come for the zoo, so the zoo it was. Cost us $66 for 2 adults + for an extra $5 each we could have used the tram. Elected to walk but the lady at the entrance had neglected to,provide us with a map. Fortunately, not really needed as plenary of signage & maps throughout. An enjoyable & easy area to navigate & really enjoyed the white tiger, elephants, polar bear & the dinosaur display (the kids will really love this!). Had lunch in the bistro area of Ah Meng, which was easy to purchase (had Mee Siam & parter had Laksa) & reasonably priced. Can be difficult to find a table when busy, but keep looking, tables are quick to free up. Overall a positive & enjoyable experience with the only negative being, the queuing system for taxis. Seems to be rather disorganised & took much longer than expected given that there are many taxis queued on site. Would have expected 2-4 taxis being filled simultaneously rather than one taxi at a time. Quite a wait for tired bodies. However, this did not detract from a pleasant day out at the zoo. Can recommend Singapore Zoo for old & young alike."
,,best ..... is it???,3.0,,"really , thought it would be amazing, like any other zoo ive been too.. the night time safari show was very very dissapointing , to wait and line up with hundreds and hundreds of people thinking we were going to see something spectacular, did not eventuate, 3 or 4 small animals appeared with little commentary and that was it... no not reccomending this at all..."
,,Night Safari,2.0,,"We headed off with great excitement thinking we would be in the Zoo at night. Took a taxi and arrived to find a huge number of people waiting to get in, and the Zoo let people through at set times till quite late at night. The idea is that you can walk for some then hop on the little train and ride for some.
I was disappointed with the whole thing, we were hot and tired, and decided to get on the train, however although there were a large number of trains they were full and we sat with about 30 people at the one and only train stop watching at least 8 trains pass us. We eventually gave up and walked the rest of the way."
,,Enjoyable but didn't get the hype.,4.0,,Maybe if you had kids with you this would be a great attraction but it just didn't set the world on fire for us. Queuing and more queuing to not see much whilst driven around on a tram in the dark. I know it's a night safari but half the animals couldn't be seen. If you want to see the animals go to the zoo during the day.
,,Good attraction in singapore,4.0,,"Night safari is one of the main attraction in Singapore.
Animals are kept in such a way to protect their natural habitats and social structures.
The travel arrangements and announcement system in the zoo is praise worthy.
Being a tourist one can enjoys its food court and bars in the zoo. The fire dance is before night safari was really amazing."
,,Really an experience you could not miss...almost a bucket list activity,5.0,,"This was my second visit to the Night Safari. This time with family. I didn't remember the first visit too much, but all I remembered is that this is a must experience for somebody who hasn't been to a night safari before. The concept itself is so unique that one must experience it. It is the sense of anticipation. First going for a tourist activity in the night that too which involves wildlife gets your pulse racing and you wonder what's in store.

The Night Safari is a zoo which you experience in the night! So, you can see wildlife in natural type surroundings in the night. One would assume that seeing wild animals in the night means they would be more at home and natural. Coming to the activity and the arrangement, it is superb. Right from the location to the entrance and then the enclosures of animals, everything is planned so well. The tram ride where you just keep quiet in anticipation and strain your eyes to catch the wild is simply an awesome experience. Must mention that the animal enclosures are strategically made so that the animal can be almost guaranteed to be found and seen by the visitors. Unless it is raining!

When we went it was raining heavily. We opted for the 7.30 pm slot. And we couldn't see many animals as they were into their shelters because of the heavy rain. So, after the first ride, we had dinner and then suddenly after dinner we noticed that the rain had eased, so we took a second ride!! Yes, you can take as many rides in the tram as you want with one booking. In our second tram ride, we caught all the animals - tiger, elephant, zebra, deer, buffalo, hyena, hogs, anteater, etc. The tram ride has long queues which are fast moving, though. So, at the outset might look as if it is going to take a lot of time, but average waiting time would be 15-20 minutes in a scenario of decently long queue. What they do in times of long queue, is introduce two sides of boarding points and they have trams coming one after another at a continuous pace.

Points of observation/tips/things to note:

1. How to reach using public transport - You have to reach Ang Mo Kio MRT on the North-South MRT Line. From there you could take a bus (No. 138) or you could take a cab. A cab would cost you approx SGD 15-17 and would take you half hour flat. A bus would take you minimum 50 minutes. What we did I feel was sensible. While going to Night Safari we took a cab because we had to reach there by 7.15 pm and we could not reach late. But while coming back in the night at around 10.30 pm we took the bus as in the night the bus takes just 35-40 minutes from Night Safari to Ang Mo Kio MRT as there is no traffic and the bus can skip many of the stops. The bus stand @ Night Safari is right next to the entrance, so you don't have to walk much. streetdirectory.com might give you more options of buses where you have to change the bus, etc. I would recommend Bus No 138 as you don't need to change anywhere. But do look up streetdirectory.com for more options and live timings of buses, MRT etc. It is the most amazing app you could have in Singapore.

2. The tram rides - I have read lots of reviews on TA which advises you to take the tram ride first if the queue is short and then do other stuff and the other way round if the queue is long. Well, frankly it doesn't matter. As I told you that it is very well managed and the queue even if long clears fast. My recommendation is to take the tram ride first because it gives you a perspective of the Night Safari arena. You could identify walking trails during the ride which you could come back and visit later. Also, when we went it was raining so we were sensible that we decided to take the tram ride first as the shows like Creatures of the Night got cancelled and you couldn't have walked anyways. So, my advice is to take the tram ride first even if the queue is long. Also, in case you don't see all the animals in the first tram ride, you could always take a second tram ride as you would have time in your hand. The trams have a running commentary in English which alerts you on all the animals you are about to see and approach and also backgrounders on those animals.

3. Eating there - there is the Ulu Ulu restaurant area. There are lots of eating options there including an Indian one. There is also a buffet option which is demarcated. We didn't opt for it so we don't know how is the fare there. But all I can say that the action in the non-buffet area is much more and livelier. There is one drinks counter there where you get all the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks you want.

4. Booking - I booked through the Wildlife Reserves website where you can book for up to 4 activities - Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo and River Safari. You get some discount if you book for more activities. I opted for only Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari. For Jurong Bird Park you get an option to visit anytime within a week. But for Night Safari you get an option of only a particular date and a time slot. So, please ensure you plan your visit to Night Safari in a concrete manner if you are booking well in advance. There are 4 slots 7.30 pm, 8.30 pm, 9.30 pm and 10.30 pm. I would recommend the 7.30 pm slot because you might as well go there and experience the tram ride first and then have enough time to do other stuff like dinner, go for walking trails, do more tram rides, see the shows, etc. Also, in most cases, if you go to Night Safari, you will practically do nothing more that evening anyways because it is far and secluded and doesn't have any other things to do in the vicinity.

5. If it rains - then they have arrangements to sit in the tram and they have these polythene screen guards which they bring down on all sides. So, you are protected from the rain and at the same time, you can see through the polythene sheet. But, obviously, it is a dampener as sometimes you cannot see things clearly. So, if it rains then anything at the Night Safari becomes a dampener. The shows get cancelled and the dinner area also gets restricted as you cannot sit in the open and finally you cannot go for those walking trails. So, please pray that it doesn't rain when you visit!!

6. Shows and walks - we were unlucky that it was raining. So, all shows of the Creatures of the Night were cancelled except the last one at 10.30 pm which we then decided not to go because we were too tired and it was a bit late with a 6-year-old daughter. So, we missed the show which I believe is a very good one. Just wanted to point out something. If it rains, then don't lose hope. Because the moment the rain stops, the organisers will open up the next show timing. And in Singapore, just like it can start raining any moment, it could stop raining any moment too irrespective of how heavy it might be. About the walks, must point out that there are lots of trails like the Leopard Trail, the Wallaby trail, etc. We didn't venture out to those, but they definitely look very interesting. I think you should take out time and go for these walks. My view is just to be on your own in front of the animals is more of an adventure than just seeing the animal from the tram which gives you some sense of protection. Also, when you go for a walk you obviously have the luxury to spend whatever time you want looking at a particular animal.

7. Must point out that like every other place everything is well organised and the staff is efficient and courteous in spite of the huge rush and queue for the trams. So, compliments to the organisers.

To summarise, Night Safari is a must for people who haven't experienced it. It is a once in a lifetime kind of experience. It is unique. And trust me you will not regret the visit. You get to see most of the animals as the enclosures are made strategically in such a manner that the animals can be found out in the open and seen easily. The night lighting is done in such a manner that you get that adventure feel of actually seeing an animal in the night. A must do if you have kids above 5 to 6 years of age."
,,Must see place,5.0,,"Night safari is unique safari that I saw and very different experience.
Enjoyed the show and then the tour that takes place around the park with animals kept in open spaces.

Feels nice to walk around and take the tour bus also.

Be prepared to walk a lot."
,,Night safari,4.0,,A unique experience to see all animals under light at night while you move in a mini train. Also shows shown at regular intervals is icing on the cake
,,The best zoo I have ever been to,5.0,,"We went on a really packed day over Christmas holiday. We arrived 30 min early for our scheduled time, and were glad we did, as we were towards the front of the queue for our time. The staff were very professional, and at no point did the mass of people get out of hand.

We headed straight for the trams (only because we were fearful we might not get one later, due to the 10pm entries but we needn't have worried). This was the first sight we had had of the ""no cage"" zoo, it was incredible! The deer are standing right next to you, and the lions are just on a hill over a tiny stream. Being in the dark, just made it more of an adventure.

After this we went to walk up the trails, which were also brilliant. As many people seemed to just do the trams and go home, a lot of the time it felt like it was just my husband and I in the whole zoo! This was also great, because it really is set in a rainforest, so we got a sense of where we were in the world...which sometimes Singapore can lack.

We will definitely come back next time we are in Singapore."
,,Amazingly Informative and relaxing,5.0,,"what a fun night we had on the night safari, was so relaxing, informative and chill, i wasn't so convinced with a night safari visit, a couple of friends and family insisted and I am glad I did it, the fire show was also great."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"Perhaps I'm a bit jaded but if you've been to The Animal Kingdom in Orlando and gone on the safari, this is nothing special.
Yes it's at night, which is kinda cool but also makes it more difficult to see the animals, particularly for kids. It also means no flash photography, although there's always THAT guy (don't be that guy).
Lastly, I failed to notice any more activity on the part of the animals. The tiger was dead asleep against the glass. We couldn't see him from the tram. We saw his back smushed against the glass on the walking trail.
The walking trails are a nice touch and it was cool to see the kangaroos and wallabies, I haven't seen those in person before.
In conclusion, I'm NOT nocturnal by nature. If I'm going to be out until almost midnight, I prefer having an adult beverage in hand."
,,So happy,5.0,,"Finally renovations are done and the animals are out in the night! I had a great time with friends on Sunday evening!

A little disappointed with the creatures of the night show, only because it seemed less interesting than before. Even though it should've at least been the same.

The tram ride was great. Pushpa was a delight to listen to and was really clear and informative! Good job Pushpa! You definitely made the journey a pleasant one.

We went for a little walk about on our own with all the beautiful led coloured lights of animals everywhere. That might be my favourite addition to the Night Safari.

Also I think Jubilee was in the giraffe pit. It was a small giraffe that we saw alone. Or is there yet another beautiful addition?

As much as I love giraffes, I was so happy to see Chawang, my favourite big boy elephant. I'm so sad to hear he's in isolation but it's for his own good. I'm happy to see him active still."
,,Unique experience in Singapore,5.0,,"I dont know of any other zoos that offer this experience and its great. The animals are more active at night and as the Zoo works to have no visible barriers it makes for a sometimes scary encounter. Good example of this is the hyenas peering at you, of course there is a barrier but its not obvious to the eye and at night they are very alert.
We saw all sorts of animals but some special encounters with the fishing cats, 3 legged leopards and the tigers. The night show was also worth going to as they bring out some unusual animals and give some background on them. There is no touching or flash photography so the nocturnal animals are treated respectfully.
The only downside to the Zoo is the cost of food should you need to eat there at one of the restuarants so try to avoid this if possible."
,,Very different Zoo experience,5.0,,"Many animals are nocturnal, especially most felines (cats) are, so actually a no-brainer to have a night-zoo... Still this is absolute exceptional! The way you can experience the animals in the (semi-dark) is fantastic! You take the tram to see most of the major sights and hop off the tram to walk along one of the four trails and then return to the tram. Next to the big cats my favourite were the bats..."
,,Just about ok !!,2.0,,This place is little far off and in the safari it is so dark that sometimes you wonder where are the animals. Visit at your own wish as the tickets are not cheap 30 $ approx. I did not find it worth the money.
,,Wonderful Experience,4.0,,This was my first visit to the Night Safari and it was a great night. I would recommend it to anyone traveling to Singapore. Easy to get to using the SAEX bus that picks up from a number of hotels. A wonderful evening.
,,Don't waste your money here... Bring your kids to the Science Centre or the Aquarium for more educational visits,2.0,,"Spend S$180+ for 20 minutes queuing with some 35 minutes tram ride looking at generally same animals in regular safari parks like the Taman Safari Indonesia in Cisarua and Bali. Absolutely expensive and not a bargain at all!! the only upside was that dinner cost us another S$60-70, but at least it was good quality."
,,Only if price is discounted or you get free entry,3.0,,"The place is not very big and it's packed with people. You have to booked in advance for the session that you want. Best if you booked online rather than go there and start buying your tickets because the crowd can be big and you do not want to be disappointed not having a tickets when you get there. Food outlets are limited. Most of the wild animals will be asleep if you go too late. Tram rides queue is always long. However, suggestion would be take the tram maybe 2 times to make full use of your visit. And they also will not let you in for the animal show if it is full. Take your dinner first before you go as food are limited and can be quite expensive there."
,,Tourist Trap- Not worth the money,3.0,,"After the zoo, we thought we would experience the night safari. When we arrived we were confronted by a que about 20 metres long and were told that we had to wait here until we were allowed into the safari.

Once allowed in, we decided that we would watch the ""Creatures of the night"" show. If we knew that the show was boring, and aimed for little kids we would have just gone straight to the actual safari.

After the show we went to lineup for the tram ride. English being the most predominate language spoken by tourist and locals you would think that there would be more than one English speaking tram- no there is only one tram that speaks English. We had to wait nearly one hour to get on a tram to complete the safari. The safari itself was ok. It was hard to see most of the animals but the animals you could see were cool.

My overall advice is to not bother with the night safari."
,,wonderful night,5.0,,"It was a great experience to visit the animals during night. It was a nice and very quit stroll with a small train in the night, precede by a nice dance. The animals were sleepy and you have an electrificated groove betwen you and the animals, but stiil the adrenaline is going up. We have seen many animals even ones that I never heard of, the atmonsphere was nice, I would do it again."
,,Absolute waste of money,1.0,,We decided to visit with friends due to everyone recommending. We opted for the tour and buffet dinner. Firstly the bus had to wait at one hotel for 20 mins for one guest to join which meant the dinner was rushed (30 mins). The tram tour is poor and so is the show. Don't waste your time and money on this!!
,,Don't waste your money!,3.0,,"Started well with on time collection from hotel.Taken to another pickup point where we had to board another coach .Waited here for over 20 minutes which then put the tour on the back foot.Arrived at Zoo later than expected meaning we were then all rushed during the buffet meal.Food was good but no time to really enjoy.No sooner had we finished the dessert( those lucky enough to actually get a dessert) we were all ushered to the Tram .Another wait of 10 possible more minutes before we actually boarded the tram ( because some of the group had not finished their meal !!! Or did not have time to use the washroom facilities?) What priority boarding!!!!!
Actual Tram ride was good but not as many animals seen as expected/ hoped . Overall Safari looked very staged .
Night creature show was ok but nothing to talk about.
And to top off trip two young girls got on our bus only to discover they were on wrong bus resulting in two of our passengers being left behind at the Zoo!!!!
On a positive note the guide was excellent and very funny."
,,A Good Way to See Some Wilds,5.0,,It is a good way of watching wild animals. Explanation on each animal will be given when you are travelling on a tram.
,,Night Safari in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited the Night Safari on one of our first nights in Singapore. It is worth the effort and is better to purchase the 4 park hopper tickets, which you can use once each over a week period.

It is best to do one of the later tours, after 730pm as all the families with younger children book these early tours. It gives you more time and space to do the tour at your own pace.

We got an opportunity to see most of the animals and the English tour explained most things.

It is worth the visit but it hasn't changed much from when I visited a number of years ago."
,,Worth visiting but not incredible,3.0,,It gets very crowded and I don't think the crowds are managed well. Seems a little inefficient at times cramming people in the long lines and allowing so many through at each seating. You will get a good look of all the animals with no fences between you and them so that is a highlight!
,,Nignt Zoo,5.0,,"Try the night zoo! Undoubtedly the best 'zoo' experience I have ever had. Well worth doing. You get to see the animals so close up, it is incredible!"
,,Good but very busy,4.0,,"Was so busy ( 30th Dec 2016) had to que for an hour before we got on the tram! Was quite well organised though so que kept moving. We went when it first opened as well so I'm glad we didn't go later. We had prebooked tickets online which I would recommend people do otherwise you could be there hours.

Enjoyed seeing all the animals whilst going round on the tram. The commentary was very informative. Seem to be very close to the animals at times which was pretty good.

Worth a visit but be prepared for millions of people and a long wait!"
,,Awesome to see all of this in the evening when the animals come out to play,5.0,,"This was a fantastic evening and we were blowen away with the whole activity. We arrived around 8pm and were there for a couple of hours. We did the drive through and also walked through our selves and both were fantastic. The animals were all pretty active which is something you don't see often at zoo's. Kids and family's would love this activity! It wasn't to busy for us when we went so queues were pretty much non existent, however, I could see the potential for massive queues if it became really busy so just be careful with this."
,,"Good for families and kids, not adults",2.0,,"The night safari in Singapore is described as a ""must do"" for people of all ages. While it's definitely an experience to go to the zoo at night, this is more appropriate for families with young children's. Safari is an misleading term here- you oath to see a children's show about night animals and then board a tram that takes you through parts of the park at night (you can do the walk yourself). The interesting part is that the animals are quite close to the tram and the diversity of animals is impressive (you'll see lions and tigers and elephants etc) but it's more of a night zoo exploration."
,,Really average,3.0,,Not much to see honestly. This is not a must especially if you already visited the zoo during the day.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"A unique experience and one I would recommend to everyone interested in animals. The safari train journey with commentary is atmospheric in itself but then you can get off at certain points and trek round the various paths on your own, something I will do next time. There is a show regularly in an open air amphitheater, which is ideal for children and has an environmental and ecological bias to it."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We loved the night safari, it was so interesting to see the animals up close and awake! It can get super busy so just arrive a little earlier than your allotted time. The animals all seem to be looked after well and the staff seem to know so much about them. We did the walking trails first followed by the tram as you get to see different animals on both trials."
,,Neat evening zoo,5.0,,"This is a should be thing to do while in singapore, especially with children

This is part of the Singapore zoo complex, but a separate attraction only open at night. The three main parts are a tram ride around the park, an animal show and paths you can walk to see the animals closer up. The tram ride lasts about 45 minutes and the show is 30 minutes.

The tram ride brings you around the exhibits showing you different animals at night in their habitats. They use special lighting to simulate moonlight. It was neat to see, though the animals were mostly deer type animals, though there were a few big ones like elephants etc.

The animal show was great. They brought out a bunch of different animals - there were some otters trained to even handle trash. Was quite neat, and my 11 year old daughter like this the most.

You can also walk around the paths and see the animals closer, though we didn't do this.

The cab ride from Orchard rode was about $19 SGD.

Worth a visit"
,,This is not worth the time,1.0,,We were very disappointed in this tour...This is really more appropriate for younger children...We along with our adult children were very disappointed in this tour... Don't waste your time unless you have very low expectations...
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,This attraction took place at Singapore Zoo. Visitors will get on the tram and will see various attractions. It was a unique experience.
,,A bit overrated,3.0,,"It is a unique experience, but we had higher expectations when we saw their website. Some inclosures were not very clean. A tip: if you arrive take the walking trips first and then the train."
,,Worth it,5.0,,"A very nice experience after a worm day in Singapore. The night breeze while walking no far than 10 metres from lions, elephants, and much more animals, was a real pleasure. It's a must!"
,,Night Safari at Singapore Zoo,2.0,,"Well what can I say, we knew it would probably be crowded because it was the weekend. However the show if you can get in was the only thing that was something close to being OK. The Zoo promises to be something fantastic but honestly do not waste your money. There was no bang for your buck and it cost $126.00 and didn't deliver. They put you on a train that quietly goes through the forest (park) and you expect it to be dark but if you are lucky enough to be seated in the right spot you might catch a glimpse of some animals. I should mention that if you go there by your self then you can expect to queue for hours. Honestly don't waste your money. Good luck if you have already booked."
,,Zoo is amazing!,5.0,,"We went to the Night Safara at the zoo with a tour, which included the International buffet there. My only regret is that we didn't have time to visit the zoo during the daytime as well, because you see different animals. However, Singapore is very hot (tropical climate -- hot and muggy with occasional rain), so if you go during day, go early in AM, or it will be too hot.

There are no cages. All animals are in their natural environment. The zoo is huge, so it's great they have a tram to take your around, but there is also a place to hop off/hop on, where you can actually walk for a while to see the animals.

I would recommend the bus tour there, because you get preferred treatment when waiting for the trams that take you around the zoo, and because we were there at Christmas time, it was very crowded.

I would also recommend the International buffet. The food was varied and tasty. We were also able to see an animal show at night, but I didn't think that part was great (but it was included in the price). I just felt the man talked to much, instead of showing more animals."
,,Excellent tram ride. Very busy.,5.0,,"Having done the zoo and the River Safari, stay on and do the Night Safari. Be wary. It is extremely popular and the queue to get in gets long, fast. In 10 minutes it went from no one to 100's (and that was 25 minutes before they even open the gates). If you get a meal from the vendors there, it is pretty expensive ($27 for two half pints of beer). Once inside you are free to walk the trails or hop on any of the trams. These are an excellent way to see some real highlights of animals at night. Whether you walk the trails or use the tram, there is strictly no flash photography allowed. They will pounce on you and remind you firmly if you do not to do it. We really enjoyedvit because it is something we have not experienced before elsewhere."
,,Slick Presentation,4.0,,"We did the night safari, which was OK. I think I would have preferred to see the zoo by day. A number of (nocturnal) animals were no where to be seen so we spent a lot of time squinting in the dark trying to see if they were just hiding. I'd recommend it but probably would not do it again."
,,Very cool!,5.0,,Great experience for the kids - fire dancers and outdoor show was very entertaining. Get on the tram and enjoy the tour of the park.
,,Overcrowded and shouty guides,2.0,,"This was one of the poorest run tourist experiences of our trip. The facility itself is good, the food outlets were poor in terms of range, price and quality. By far the worst thing was despite the ability to restrict the number of tickets sold (online), management still went ahead and sold way too many of the 9.15pm show after the 7.15 and 8.15 evening shows sold out. One is left speculating why they continued to sell tickets when their staff were clearly having incredible difficulty managing the queues and crowds. For the 10pm creatures of the night show, people were advised to begin queuing an hour beforehand. For us, this meant missing out on either the Safari tram ride itself, or the Show. Very poor and recommend you pass on this show during school holidays or end of year season. Staff could be better trained too, many spoke aggressively and dismissively trying to marshall the long queues and crowds."
,,"An incredibly crowded, very disappointing complete waste of time and money!",1.0,,"I pre-booked and visited with my 3 daughters last Monday night at 9pm.We arrived early and joined the queue at 8pm for the trams as advised but were diverted to the Special ""Creatures of the night"" show which was woeful. The show was more about the 2 game keeper hosts and volunteers from the 500+ audience who came up to feed the 4 or 5 tame creatures on stage whilst held by their trainers!They managed to drag it out for more than 45 minutes with constant interruptions by late arriving people who again had to be warned in 4 languages about no flash photography. We cur our losses and joined the tram ride around the food lit open zoo. Very disappointing to find a few deer, elephants asleep, many animals not there presumably sleeping. We then walked for over one hour on the trials and saw 2 leopards asleep and some wallabies nothing else!!We then got a cab back to our hotel,very hot and humid,disappointed and very annoyed that Trip Advisor had given it such a glowing rating!"
,,Something you can't get in western contries,5.0,,"Easy way to get familiar with jungle effects and tropical animals as well. Okay, of course this is business - but try to cope with that and enjoy very unique zoo experience. In many places you really forgot that there really is safety systems between you and animals... There is warm and sweaty but consider to wear long shirt + thousers. I would definitely recomment this expirience for all my friends."
,,"Good place to visit, but slightly over hyped",3.0,,"Its a good place to visit with friends or with family. However when compared with the other attractions like river safari / Jurong Bird park, it falls short. Its a unique experience to see animals in pitch dark but you don't see many animals in action as most of them are hiding somewhere or sleeping already.

Even on a weekday there is lot of rush (may be because I visited during Christmas holidays) and the waiting for tram was almost like 50-60 mins. Take the tram ride for sure as it covers most of the park and then you can explore on walking tours along the trails of your interest. Overall, its a different experience, however over expensive and slightly over hyped. If you have more than 3-4 days in Singapore and seriously want to view it go for it, else skip it."
,,Arrive Early to Beat the Masses,3.0,,"The Night Safari was mostly a standing-in-line event. The crowd was epic. It seemed everybody in Singapore had come out. The waiting, first in the ticket line; then, in the tram line exceeded 2 hours. Be sure to order your tickets on-line. We didn't and wished we had. A strategy for a quicker turnaround would be to arrive early and beat the masses. We spent so much time waiting that we missed the Creatures of the Night animal show. However, afterwards we did enjoy strolling the walking trails. It's a nice zoo with spacious habitats for the animals. Many of the animals were awake and more active than during the day. We also walked through the River Safari displays which were interesting aquariums of freshwater fish from around the world which I've rarely seen."
,,Amazing night zoo!,5.0,,"We expected the night safari to be more of a hit-or-miss, given that nocturnal animals could be sleeping it off or hiding in the bushes, but nope! More than 90% of the animals were actually visible, and we got to see rare species like the endangered slow loris, or a majestic Bengal tiger strolling only 2-3 feet in front of us, separated by a perfectly clear glass wall.

The safari consists of four walking trails and one tram ride. They are all mostly separate - what you see from the tram ride, you won't be able to see from the trails.

Tips:

1. There is a fire show before you enter the venue, but given the huge crowds, you probably won't be able to see it. If you've seen a Polynesian fire show in Hawaii, it's pretty much the same.

2. Arrive 30-45 minutes before your admission showtime, to get a front seat at the ""Creatures of the Night"" show. The show is aimed at kids, and good but not amazing. We saw bear cats, otters, owls, a serval cat, and a huge snake.

3. Take the walking trails first, THEN do the tram ride at the end, when it's far less crowded, and you'll be tired from walking.

Food closes early (10pm?) except for an ice cream shop."
,,Not so variety of animals,3.0,,The show was okay but not so exciting. The animals is not varieties. The restaurants is quite limited.
,,A rip off,1.0,,This is the biggest scam. Due to the distance of traveling and the huge amount that they dare asking for NOTHING much to see. Do not waste your time and your good money!!!!!!
,,Unique experience - a must do in Singapore,5.0,,"I'm not a ""zoo person"" but my husband and I decided to visit Night Safari on the recommendation of several friends. This was, by far, the most enjoyable zoo experience I've had. It was a little crowded during the Creatures of the Night show, but, like everything in Singapore, the movement of guests was managed with professionalism and efficiency. Despite the large number of visitors in the park, we did not feel crowded at all during the zoo walk and by the time we returned back to the starting point, the trams were virtually empty so our tram ride was also very pleasant. It was a wonderful experience to be up close to the animals. It was nice to see the animals living in habitats that afforded them sufficient space and comfort. We were disappointed that the shuttle bus to and from the downtown area stopped at 10.30pm and so we were left to take an Uber back to our hotel - this trip, however, was really quite cheap (only $16 if I recall correctly). Overall, this was a fantastic experience. My husband and I kept commenting that our nieces and nephews would absolutely love to visit to see these animals up close without having to pay to see animals in cages."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We did the night safari as part of a group, I found it interesting but I wouldn't do it again. You sit in a train and follow the trail around, I found I couldn't see enough as it was like being in the moonlight and the animals weren't clear enough."
,,Do if you must do it.,4.0,,There are a lot of things to do in singapore and night safari is slightly over hyped. Even if you do decide to do this attraction try the walk and not the tram. Tram is easier and faster but not as fun as the walk trails.
,,A different kind of zoo,5.0,,"Night safari is a zoo for noctunal animals. Start the tour by seeing the animal show. Be there early, the show is always very full. Then take a tram ride for the complete tour of the zoo. If you are still not tired, you can set off on foot and see the animals at your own pace."
,,Lovely and a must visit,5.0,,"Took my godchildren to the Night Safari. It is one of their favourite places to visit during the school holidays. Grandparents always came along and they love it too. So if you are visiting, I suggest not on a day that threatens to rain and avoid public and school holidays. Check beforehand if there are any promotions. Really good for animal lovers and those who lovely touring about in the night. A must visit."
,,Brilliant way to see animals,5.0,,Wonderfully organised and superbly clean. As a nature lover it was great to see the animals in a nocturnal environment. We first took the little people mover train around to get the lay of the land and then started and walked the night safari. Well sign posted and lit in the areas it needed to be.
,,Very well set up,5.0,,"We were in transit and wanting something to do for a few hours I between flights. A $30 cab fare and we were in a world away from the airport. The creatures of the night show was very cute, including an otter who could dispose rubbish. Then on to the train, were you drive past all the animals with explanation. You can get off at station three and walk around the leopard trail. You get really close to the animals whilst on the train. Well worth it."
,,Night zoo,4.0,,"We had this included as part of our cruise package,was a different experience, plus we had a very good guide, who was very knowledgeable about all the animals, would highly recommend eating before you come as the food is not very good and too expensive."
,,Delightful,4.0,,The different species of animals that were on display are delightful and entertaining. A bit scary but sweet. I enjoyed the experience and will be returning.
,,Dark but fun! Exciting!,4.0,,"The most famous guided tram ride is amazing. And don't miss to get a closer look at the animals on the walking trails, the experience is special. We walked in the dark and heard the tiger roaring. I knew we were safe but it was just exciting. The trails are short. It only took us two and a half hours to have two tram rides and finish walking all the trails."
,,Go at night,4.0,,We went at night from recommendations. There's a fire show before beginning of the tour and you can get on the train at different stops to explore each part further. Different animals come out at night. My favourite was the snow leopard.
,,Good night out for all the family,4.0,,We had a good time with our teenagers and 5 year old at the Night Safari but glad we booked a tour and avoided lots of queuing. When watching the live animal show sit to the middle or right of the amphitheatre as we were on the left and missed a couple of animals performing due to lack of vision from where we were sitting. Apart from that it was definitely worth watching!
,,Average safari,3.0,,"Having spent most of the day looking at the zoo, we decided to stay on and visit the night safari. Luckily we booked the 7.15 start time as the queues were huge when we finished our tour. The safari involves driving around in a train with a pre recorded commentary. A number of animals were not visible as we passed by them and in other cases the train would move off just as an animal was spotted. Overall, slightly underwhelming-if you have the time, visit the zoo by day for a more rewarding experience."
,,Always great to visit,5.0,,Best place to visit in Singapore We were with kid they simply loved the safari You can see all animals with out any barricade between As it was raining we were not able to see any shows
,,Great night out but prebook,5.0,,"Awesome tour! You see all the animals. It's extremely popular so definitely book tickets online, it's organised chaos so you need to be patient and be prepared to queue. Bring insect repellent. I recommend the ultimate attraction Singapore pass as you don't need to book online, you will get tickets at any on the sessions just by turning up on that day and you avoid the general admission queue for the tram as you get to go through to the members services"
,,Over rated,2.0,,"Got at the night safari at 7:20pm. The park opens at 7pm, but two sessions have already been booked so had to wait around for 9:15pm session. They let you go to the river safari to wander around some of the attractions. Went back at 8:30pm to line up in queue (very long queue) and then was let in at 9:15pm and went into another queue for the creatures of the night show. The presenter was great but wasn't that impressed with the type of animals. Then went on tram ride (and waited in another queue) which is overrated. Couldn't get any good photos because it was night and the tram was moving too fast. Wouldn't recommend this, go to Singapore zoo instead if you want to see animals"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Was a different experience, my first ever night safari. Its a grear experience watching those animals at night moreover the ride was so educational about those creatures:-)"
,,Unique experience to see Animals in their (almost) natural habitat,5.0,,"Better visit during the midtime (not the very first tour, so that it's ample dark). This will ensure that while you start from the city, not held up in traffic, however down side is that after the tour if you want to relax & eat some food, almost all retaurants in the park are closed.

We took a guided tour in the tram, which stopped in front of the natural (man made) habitat of animals came from around the world. It was a real amazing experience.
Next time plan to take the walking tour instead of a tram, so can spend more time wherever find interesting animal.

The fire show at the exit was good."
,,World class night,5.0,,"What a brilliantly executed evening, pretty haunting at times but must say what good fun we had. I must if visiting"
,,A Creative and Amazing experience,5.0,,"Do you love wildlife and zoos? Even if you don't you can't help but admire how unique and calm this experience is. The animals on show are among some of the most unique and it is so strange to see them in moonlit (artificially lit to look like moonlight) enclosures. I got to see malayan tigers, asian tusker elephants, two species of hyena and lions (Asian and white african) along side many more creatures. I felt so intrepid as the tram ride drove through thick jungle.
Since this is a popular attraction I would advise you to get on the tram as soon as possible or else wait for near to an hour for your turn. Also pack raincoats and umbrellas and unless you like KFC, don't expect any other halal food"
,,Long waiting times,2.0,,"We had reserved the 8:15 pm tour by phone and were told to arrive by 7:30 pm to pick up the tickets. We picked up the tickets on time after a few minutes wait and immediately proceeded to the entrance and a long line. We then had to wait again in a long series of lines. With the huge crowds we couldn't get on the tram until 9:30 pm. Since everywhere else we visited in Singapore during the previous week had been very well organized and no long waits, we were left with the definite impression that this park had very poor crowd control and had a policy of highly over booking. Disappointing to pay so much for what was basically a tram tour through a zoo-like park, the only difference being it was nighttime. Not worth the money and very disappointed to have to wait two hours after buying the ticket and standing in lines to board the tram. Management needs to do a MUCH better job of limiting the number of tickets they sell so there are not such long waits. Waiting two hours for a 15-20 minute tram ride is not the way such a park should be run."
,,Not worth the journey or the money,2.0,,"The Singapore zoo (and night safari) are a 35 minute drive from the city- which is quite expensive in a taxi, take an express shuttle bus if you are going. Once you are there it is very hard to see the animals as they are normally in the dark. The two shows they offer were quite short- the creates of the night show only had 5 animals. It was a lot of money for what we did and saw. If you are going to do a zoo in Singapore I suggest going during the day."
,,A unique experience,5.0,,We loved our visit to the night safari. It is amazing to get so close to animals at night and see them so active. The night safari is beautifully set up so that you feel like you are viewing the animals without barriers. There is a rear train ride that takes you through the zoo and you can hop off at various spots to see even more animals. There is a great variety of animals to view. This was a top experience that I would highly recommend to everyone.
,,Organized but cant hardly see the animals,3.0,,"It was a nice experience having a zoo visit at night. However, we can barely see the animals. It's just like looking at the shadows. Staff were organized and see to it that the guests do not wait long in the queue."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"While you can see mostly all the animals during daytime in Singapore Zoo, this safari is just across the zoo but to visited after 7pm. Nicely conducted safari in the trams with commentary and you will love seeing those nocturnal animals in the night."
,,Very disappointing,2.0,,"Very long lines, despite the fact we had tickets in advance.
No chance to look at the show which starts 15 minutes after the entry time since its all booked.
Biggest problem- the trails are extremely dark, you can barely see the animals nor can you really feel the experience of a ""safari"".
If you want to see the animals, go in the daytime."
,,"Up Close & Personal - Your Children, Their Animals!",5.0,,"What a great night out for families, book early to ensure you get a spot on one of the earlier tours if you have young children! The Night Safari provides up close and personal access to many wonderful creatures of the night that you'd never get to see anywhere else!

Go for a quick walk first when you get in the gates, have a look at some of the animals that are out and feeding while others queue up for the tram... come back in 30 mins to the tram station at the start and you'll have no queues and will have seen animals others will miss!!

The animals on the tram ride will be there regardless of the time, the animals on the walls will eat and duck off back into the bushes out of sight so go for a walk first!

A great spot for children, our 4 and 7 year olds got the out side seats of the team and had animals within a meter of them as we travelled through (no fences!!), an awesome experience all round!! Food at the main restaurant was expensive but tasty.

Highly recommend the Night Safari!"
,,Great concept yet crowds can be overwhelming,3.0,,"My husband and I bought the park hopper pass and went in at 8.15 pm. On the night we went the 7.15,8.15 and 9.15 entrance times were sold out. The queue/lineup to get in at 8.15 pm started as soon as the 7.15 pm people had entered.

The crowds were overwhelming on a hot night I don't know how some families with small kids were handling the chaos. We saw some animals however poor lighting and pushy tourists meant we gave up and tried to head to the 9.30 night show which was so packed we had to sit towards the edges of the theatre and half of the show we couldn't see which was really disappointing and frustrating - clearly they would know certain seats could not see the stage.
Queues for the tram were over an hour long (we gave it a miss) and we waited just over 40 minutes for the night show and still had bad seats.

Overall while you can see nocturnal animals overall we didn't rate the experience and would really suggest people with small families weigh up the experience with being prepared for long lines in peak evenings. I would head straight for the night show and waiting up to an hour to try and get decent seats for the night show (which if we could see I think would have been worth it).

We also took a taxi about $25 from Clarke quay and it took about 25 minutes even with traffic. Transport there and back via public was lengthy and not easy."
,,Original experience,4.0,,"It's a zoo that opens its doors at night (after 7pm). Try the tram ride, whcih last approximately one hour with english comments about the various animals. The show is also pleasant. Overall I would reccommend this attraction as it is fun and original (i've never had such an experience in a zoo in the numerous countries I have visited)."
,,Dull,2.0,,"Night safari does provide all that good view due to obvious lack of light. It was very very crowded at 8:30 pm show, close to having a stampede . The vehicles are good, animals as well."
,,One of its kind,5.0,,"If you have time please visit this, if you do not have time still visit this. One of its kind , never seen such thing. All animals come to life at night and you can relax in your tram. If you want you can also take a walk . If you do not have time to visit zoo , still I would suggest do not miss this."
,,Not much to see,2.0,,"I guess it should go without saying, the night safari shows animals in their enclosures during a time where they should be asleep or almost anyway. There wasn't much activity and the shuttle moves onto the next enclosure so quickly there's not much time to appreciate the beauty of the animals"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"We went not quite sure of what to expect our were so pleased we did.

The variety of animals was excellent and the visibility was exceptional.

Highly recommend you exit the tram when it stops half way through the tour and explore on foot. Very rewarding with big cats, bats, porcupines and many other animals all on show.

Grab dinner at the food outlets before or after your safari. There is a wide selection and it is excellent quality."
,,Don't let queue put you off,4.0,,"Suggest you book in advance as tickets sell out quickly.
We waited over 30 mins in the queue, but don't let that put you off. Once inside you hardly notice others - it's amazing where everyone disappears to.
Was certainly different wandering around st night - but great fun!"
,,Wild animals looks like domestic animals,2.0,,On 20th Dec we have visited Night Safari in evening. At evening animals are not visible properly and due to heavy rain the visibility was also very poor. The animals are very quite. The wild behaviour of the animals we have not found in any animals they looks like domestic animals. Due to rain all other activities has been stopped by the authority except the tram ride. Overall we not satisfy with Night Safari.
,,Just another zoo....,3.0,,"We purchased a skip the line for the tram night safari tour. We were looking to see some animals other than what we see here in the States. We live in Orlando, Fl so we visit Animal Kingdom in Disney and we felt the safaris were very similar. Young children may enjoy this tour but for adults there are many other attractions in Singapore to see if you are on limited time constraints."
,,Different,5.0,,"This was very new for me. I've been to zoo's during the day, kind of scary at night, so I took the train ride instead of walking. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know if animals were going to come up to me so I was on guard. When they say night it is night no lights night. Ended up having a really good time, different but would do it again."
,,Night safari-absolutely superb!!,5.0,,"Our daughter lives/works in Singapore so she kindly showed us a lot of the attractions, which is a bonus! When she mentioned the night safari I have to say I was a tiny bit sceptical!! How wrong I was! It was absolutely amazing! We saw the animal show and the fire eater before we embarked the safari train. We went around twice on the train as there is a lot to see! We were lucky on the first trip as all the animals were outside in their habitats-on the second trip a thunderstorm started so the animals were no where to be seen! There are also walking tours. It's not what you can call cheap but it was well worth the visit and all staff were very welcoming and helpful!"
,,Fun!,5.0,,I like their uniqueness of being a night zoo as it is very hard to build such a zoo that animals can cooperate with the timings.The zoo's staff is very friendly.
,,superb,5.0,,watching animals in their natural habitat is worth watching experience. Should not be missed when visit singapore
,,Awesome place to visit,5.0,,"This is an awesome place to relax, fun with wildlife animals. Camera flash is banned on night safari tour. Food and night shows are awesome."
,,"Busy, busy, busy",4.0,,Enjoyable visit but absolutely packed. Once you get on a tram there are lots of animals to see and plenty of information about them and their habitats. Queues were managed well but still very long.
,,A nice tram ride through the park,5.0,,A very informative ride in a tram all around the park. takes about 40 minutes with creatures from all around the world. Do watch the creatures of the night show!
,,Zoo after hours,2.0,,"We had a coach pick us up at 6 and take us to the night safari, we paid an additional $30 for the dining option which was a buffet. The buffet option were bland and cold, they charged $45 if you weren't on the tour itself.
The night safari consisted of us riding a ""tram""- 5/6 buggys being pulled along. I had higher expectations and was not prepared to just be taken to the zoo after hours. The leaflet advertised a cage in which animals were all around you.
Most animals were just sitting there which made us question whether they were sedated. Lions are not supposed to just sit there.
We then had to queue for a while to join the night show which was decent.
Overall let down and we paid $94 each. We also did not see any pandas which is advertised on their brochures, apparently you can see them on the river cruise which is in the same location."
,,Enjoy the Zoo on the train & on foot,5.0,,"The night zoo was lots of fun and a welcome relief from a hot day.
We got there early so we could do the first train tour because we have a young child. You take a train ride around the park which takes around 45 minutes then you're free to walk around yourself on the walking tracks. I'd recommend doing the walk as well as it's a nice walk and you can stop and observe the animals for as long as you like. We also were lucky enough to come across a couple of zoo keepers and enjoyed asking them lots of questions about the animals. We particularly enjoyed the otters and were offered some pallets from the zoo keeper to feed to them. My son thought this was the highlight as they're funny creatures and very noisy.
In regards to the trains - what we did notice however is when we saw later trains, around 8pm, there was hardly anyone on them. So if you have older children, or none at all, then I'd say come a little later to avoid the hordes of people and queues.
We took public transport to get out there which was simple and inexpensive however it will take around 1.5 hours to get there on the train & bus (from Marina Bay Sands). By taxi it takes 30 minutes and costs around $30.
I noted that another reviewer said a potential problem was that you were committed to the date and time when you bought the tickets. I found that to be true of most online providers except one. VOYAGIN. I bought my tickets on the day from an online reseller called VOYAGIN. The ticket didn't offer a hard date or time. We arrived early just in case we couldn't get into the first train ride but there was no problem at all. The tickets were valide for around 3 months I think and for any of the time slots. I recommend this company as their prices were competitive and as i said, offered a choice of day & time.
Oh, don't bother trying to take pictures, they generally won't work. The only ones that worked were of the flamingoes. I was using my iPhone.
All in all a good fun experience and worth the journey to get to it."
,,Best BEst BEst,5.0,,Really one of a kind experince Book ticket in advance . We went on christmas holidays so maybe this if how I can explain the crowds for night safari. But it really worth the waiting
,,NIGHT SAFARI - Must see,5.0,,"This is a great experince for adults and kids alike .
This zoo is really amazing . The tram tour takes you around the night safari for 40 min . There are no cages and some of the animals ( not predators ) are really close to the tourists . This is indeed one of a kind experince . Should try it !"
,,Nice lovely place,4.0,,"Give feeling of tropical forest, womb of all lives without prejudice. Good time to go is to reach one hour before time mentioned in ticket otherwise tram line itself is of one hour followed by night show which has again long queue"
,,Seriously underwhelming,1.0,,"Booked this with Buffalo Tours. Billed as a 5 and half hour tour. Indeed we were picked up at 6pm and dropped back at hotel just after 11pm. Of those 5 hours we spent 40 minutes on a tram and 20 minutes in a night 'show'. The rest of the time was spent getting there and getting back and queuing. Buffalo tours clearly couldn't cope efficiently with the number of people it was taking so we ended up arriving late for the timetable their guide had told us we would take (20 min show, 40 min tram ride rest of the time exploring by ourselves). When we did arrive it was a zoo (!) - packed with people and long queues, which we were told we would miss by booking a tour company. So, pIcked up at hotel at 6pm, arrived at Night Safari at 7.35, queued for 30 minutes to get on the 'VIP no queue' tram, arriving back at 8.45 when we queued 45 minutes to get into the 'unmissable' 20 minute Creatures of the Night show, then spent 20 minutes fighting our way out and finding our bus for the return trip.
As for the events - not sure what I expected from a night safari, but our tram took as round the park where we saw in the dim light docile animals, many hidden away or standing around or just trying to sleep. There were a couple of sleepy lions, a sleeping giraffe, a rhino, and a tiger, otherwise it was many types of deer, pigs and cattle. Quite frankly a walk around your local zoo would get you to see more, get you closer, offer better visibility and see more activity in the animals. Thinking about it afterwards - why a night safari when you can't see and the animals are docile? I tried but zero photos.
As for the unmissable Creatures of the Night show, this involved 2 raccoons, 2 owls hand held, 1 otter and a small bear like creature that could sniff out a grape. Oh, and a 30 foot Python that was so bored it had to be carried in and out by 2 handlers, and otherwise looked like it wished it was anywhere else.
If you have children under 8 years of age, they might get a kick out of this. The families I saw there were stressed out by the queuing and the sheer numbers of people. This is a terrible waste of a whole evening in beautiful Singapore."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"If you are the first-time traveler to Singapore with kids or parents, make sure to include this activity in your itinerary. Try for the 7.30 or 8.30 pm show. During my visit, it was raining heavily so they canceled the 9.30 pm show. I feel sad for the visitors who missed out on that day.

It was an awesome experience passing through the rainforest in the tram on that rainy night."
,,one of the best,5.0,,dont miss . dont miss . dont miss. you should go there . one of the best things in singapore to see and check out for all the familyl
,,Great idea,4.0,,Loved the concept of the night safari as kids loved it very much. But we didnt like the idea of booking it on specific times that kids had to wait for couple of ours when we finished the river safari tour. The queues were so long and boring. But it worths the wait when we had the tram tour. Kids loved it very much and looking forward to come back again in few years
,,Welcome to the jungle..,5.0,,The night safari..as the name suggests is an attraction to be visited late evening.its a bit away from the city so have to leave abt late afternoon- early evening. the trip inside consists of u sitting in a sort of mini train and moving around the park..as u move along u see a variety of wild animals.they have prepared a sort of natural habitat for them.and they are not separated by any big wall..infact most places u dont see any fence. There seems to be some sort of electric fence so the animals dont cross over. Flash photography is banned as it may startle the animals.apart from tiger who was behind a glass wall even thr lion was out in the open..there is info given as u move along the track on the speaker.overall a good place to visit
,,Unusual-- must see!,5.0,,"This is a very popular attraction, and for good reason. We only went for the night, but I would imagine that this must be one of the best zoos in the world. And at night, you get an experience which is truly different and wonderful. Be sure to walk the trails!! The Creatures of the Night show was a bit cheesy, but still fun."
,,A must do!,5.0,,Didn't expect the tour to be this good! The safari takes about 40 minutes and shows lots of animals you don't see on the walking track. The walking tracks are good with not many uphill parts. Reccommended for all ages!
,,It's called presentation,4.0,,Animals came besides your tram by the artificial effects of light. Quite an interesting way to explore a Zoo riding a tram. Nice stuff. Flash photography is prohibited.
,,Not worth the visit,2.0,,"If you are planning to visit the singapore zoo, this might look like viewing the same thing at night sitting in a tram. The shows creatures of the night was perhaps not upto the standard and at times , if the animals dont turn up or perform as required , you feel like going to show to watch nothing but same pitches asking people where they are from. If you visit all the 4 parks , you might encounter monotonous pitches in all the shows. There are walking trails in the night , not recommended for families and people who hate walking around."
,,All animals in third active stage,5.0,,It is the superb experience among the animals in their hunting time .gives immense sense of closeness within the animals .thanks to Night safari for arranging such a experience
,,Great way to spend and evening with kids or without,4.0,,"Not sure how else to sum it up. Take the tour and learn about the animal you are looking at, many of which are roaming free around you. Most zoo animals are nocturnal so more active at night versus when you usually go to the zoo during the day. After the tour walk along the trails and listen, smell and see them in all their glory."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Unique experience of seeing animals in natural habitat at night. kids will Really Enjoy. One can take photos without flash, so ensure to change the Setting in your camera or phone camera. Saw a lot of people struggling with flash in phones when recording video."
,,Jungle at its best,5.0,,"It was an experience to see animals in thier natural habitats in night , a wonderful show followed by a night safari ride in small toy train .

One could see all those exotic animals and endanger species which the zoo has some hiw managed to keep alive .

Not only kids but even the elders enjoys this ride , its a must go for place in Singapore"
,,Not so Intresting!!,3.0,,Did not enjoy this one as much ....Was very tiring and nothing exiting to see . Can be skipped if you do not have much time .
,,Pretty good,4.0,,It was great to see animals in a different way. The best part of the visit was the meet the animals show. Loved it must see
,,Spend a night here and you will be amazed,5.0,,I loved the atmosphere of the place. Very beautifully designed. With interesting trails and everything connected back to the main lobby. I enjoyed the guided tram ride the most. Definitely recommend this place
,,A must when in Singapore,5.0,,"What a great idea! Visited in December 2016, with two children aged 9 and 7. You get to see nocturnal animals in a (relatively) natural environment. We did all the walks, the tram and the Creatures of the Night show. All were worth doing. We queued for the Creatures of the Night show, and I'm not sure you could avoid that, but it was worth it. We did the walks when the queue for the tram was long, and came back and pretty much walked straight on after the queue had died down. It's a late night for youngsters, but we were completely jet-lagged anyway, so it didn't make much difference! Plenty of taxis when we came out to get back into the city in about 30 minutes (taxis are cheap in Singapore, so this was easier than other options). Highly recommended."
,,"Great fun for family and visitors, one of a kind Zoo for a night time visit",4.0,,"We lived in Singapore for a number of years and would almost always take friends and family on the tram through the Night Safari during their stay. Truly one of a kind in terms of the type of animals, the set up, the ability to see animals at night versus the standard fare. Suggest paying extra to get access to the priority tram line; will save considerable time."
,,Good Entertainment Activity,4.0,,"The Night Safari was a good entertainment activity where one could experience the ""Jungle Feeling"" just an hour or less away from the ""Concrete Jungle of Singapore"" with well paved roads, tall buildings, shopping malls etc.

A lot of effort is taken by the Night Safari Crew to give the guests a memorable experience. The Safari takes you in a Tram with three coaches linked through darkness with a Guide speaking good English through a public address system explaining everything pertaining to the animals kept on display on either side of the track.

Overall it was as a good experience to see animals in comfort and safety."
,,Amazing zoo concept!,4.0,,"This is a really interesting way to see the zoo... At night! The animals are all up and it's creepy seeing these beasts up close in the dark... What I really found amazing is how the cages are so small and strategically hidden so that it seems that the animals are just hanging out in the open!
The show they put up was just average though and the overall number of animals was not very large. I did enjoy it a lot, though. Staff was quite friendly and cooperative. Do try this when you're in Singapore."
,,Wow!,4.0,,The Singapore night Safari was fun ! Great ride with a number of animals to see. Though many more can be added. Not a lot of options. Indian Zoos could be more thrilling like Nandan Kanan etc. But nice place to be in when In Singapore. A number of places to eat and take photos nearby
,,OK,3.0,,"I must admit to being quite disappointed at this night safari. It is obviously very popular, with massive queues to access the trams. Both my son and I had read many great reviews but we did the tour on the tram and then decided to wait for the bus back to the hotel. In fairness, we didn't do any of the walking treks, which may have made this better. The vast majority of the animals were deer/antelope-type animals, with the more interesting animals sleeping (lions, tiger, hyenas). In fact, the couple who were sitting next to us on the tram actually fell asleep halfway round and I had to waken them to get off the tram at the end."
,,Nice for a once over,3.0,,We went for a night safari and did not find it very interesting. Its like any other zoo. The animal show was however out of the world. It was a treat to see how animals were trained. Dont miss it if you plan to visit
,,A truly unique zoo experience,5.0,,"On a recent family visit to Singapore, this was my personal favorite. Visiting a zoo at night is not something you get to do anywhere else, and the exhibits get you up close and personal with exotic animals from around the world. Buy tickets online, and arrive early. My suggestion is to go to the Animals of the Night show first, and then do the tram tour. After the tram ride, be sure to do all of the walking trails. The tram ride is very good, but the trails get you close to the animals, and you can move at your own pace. The zoo is a long way from downtown, but if you plan things right, you can save a bundle on transportation. The zoo web site tells you which train stops to use and which bus routes to take from there to the zoo grounds. The bus drops you off right at the gate. Keep in mind that the last bus leaves about midnight, but you need to leave about 10:30 to get the last train. We saved about SG$10 per person by using the bus/train system."
,,Enjoyed it,5.0,,Amazing place to see the animals in the dark. It adds a nice thrill compared to a normal zoo. Kids enjoyed it. The setting was nicely done.
,,Average,3.0,,"Night safari, singapore zoo and river safari are activities part of the same park. Probably doing 1 covers most of it although each provides a different experience. Personally I feel the Zoo is the best of the lot. Night Safari is decent but if you take a tram ride, the trip is over in about 45mins. There are couple of shows which are good. Restaurants are nearbuy but I found the food to be average. Overall an average experience, just overhyped probably. Couple of pics from the Zoo in broad daylight, rest from the night safari."
,,The jungle comes alive.......,5.0,,"The night safari and now the river safari as well gives you a feeling of being in the jungle at night. Yes, though you will never get the real feeling of being in say Jim Corbett or Ranthambore, etc but then you can never visit national parks at night. So its a good experience to see animals at night. Please bear in mind that flash photography and videos are not allowed during the safari."
,,not as good as its reputation,3.0,,"didn't really see many animals as they were mostly asleep. Also there were no lights too see them with, and flashes weren't allowed, understandably. didnt really think it was worth the money but a good thing to say you've done."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"The night safari is SO MUCH BETTER than singapore zoo. The animals are left to roam around freely and are not forced to do any kind of shows for entertainment. You can just watch them be themselves, they were much more active during the evening. So fun and relaxing going around the park on the tram. We got the last tram with no body else on, loved it."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Train ride through the park was really interesting. I had purchased ticket through a tour company, so didn't have to wait in the ticket counter. However, lines to board the train was long, it took 15-20 minutes around 7:30 pm ."
,,Try River Safari and Zoo on the Same day.,4.0,,"We took a pass which included river safari, night Safari, zoo and Joorong Bird Park. I liked River safari the most then followed by zoo. In zoo don't miss their shows at 3 and 5PM."
,,Loved It!!!!!!!,5.0,,"I absolutely loved the Night Safari, and it has now replaced the Sydney Zoo as my favorite animal park. I loved the trails that were easy to follow and the tram ride. It was so awesome to see the animals at an active time. Totally worth it, and should not be missed!!"
,,We love it!,5.0,,"Totally different from the daylight zoo. You will get to see the animals grom near view while travelling in a tram. Nice food and cafe. Feeling like you are in another land while watching the shows. My kids love it because of the different feeling when they thought ""its just a zoo"" but hey.... its like in a jungle safari!"
,,A Must See Activity,5.0,,"Opening after dark and staying open until late, this is a superb opportunity to see nocturnal creatures such as lions, tigers, bears, wolves, tapirs (and so on and so on) in an active state in a generally undisturbed environment. The lights in the canopy are enough to provide good viewing of teh animals as well as shortening the perspective so that it seems as if the animals are almost within touching distance (mostly they're not - they're safely behind electric fences, water and ditches) and some actually are roaming freely (antelope, etc).

You have to take a buggy ride which lasts about 40 minutes but, afterwards, you can wander around on various trails at your leisure. I recommend the fruit bat enclosure.

There are plenty of choices to eat in a large food court and some tours have dinner included. As always, there are plenty of shopping opportunities too.

Be aware. It can be very crowded and there is a lot of organisation required as you will be marshalled around according to which type of ticket you've purchased. Going with an organised tour is a good way to cut through the crowds.

This was my second visit and I'd recommend it to anyone."
,,Way out of town.,4.0,,Wonderful experience for anyone who hasn't been to a real game park in Africa. Can be very crowded. Book and arrive early. (7:15 session)
,,Unique safari.,3.0,,"It's a unique safari because of its timing(night). Otherwise, not much to recommend it, if you have little kids with you. No flash photography or lots of noise to avoid disturbing the sleeping/resting animals."
,,Only wish is more energy,5.0,,"This was a fabulous experience for our family. The kids (7 and 9) were mesmerized. But honestly it was even great for the parents. Lions mucking around, elephants with a baby, animals next to the tram and many walking trails to enhance the experience. I only wish we had the energy to take full advantage of it all, but even starting at 715pm the kids didn't get to bed until midnight. Definite must see!"
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Always love this attraction and can't wait to bring a beloved friend's son to visit. It is still a very refreshing experience for me, yet him and my other guests it is a wonderful experience to see the animals being so alert and active at night. The deers move freely while the lions, rhinoceros and the tiger rest quietly in their enclosure. Our tram driver is really wonderful and points to us many well hidden creatures of the night. Only disappointment is they no longer do the narrative live but recorded. The creatures of the night show has to be one of the highlight as well. It is such a great evening for us!"
,,Night safari,4.0,,Must watch Singapore attraction. It is good to choose the 7:30pm slot if you are visiting the night safari for the first time.
,,Worth visit for night safari experience,4.0,,"First the guide take us to a safari walk. They show us some animal such as owl, komodo, binturong, elephant, rooster etc then they take us to night safari journey

Different with morning safari, our night safari journey is more interesting. They put us inside giant cage that allow us to have more interaction with the animals.

They have provide us with the animal food. We can feed zebra and elephant with carrot.

The most amazing experience is when the tiger jump into our cage. The zookeeper feed them with chicken leg. While they enjoying their dinner we can tickle their tummy.

Our night safari package come with buffet dinner at tsavo lion restaurant. The menu is just so so. But it good enogh to fill our tummy.

After dinner we can enjoy african fire dance located at the garden next to the restaurant and take picture with one animal at the hotel lobby."
,,waste of time,2.0,,they show you buffaloes etc from a tram from 7 to 11 pm....hows that a night safari....not worth it the animals are less than what you see in the zoo during day time
,,Omggggg amazing!!!!,5.0,,"We decided to walk around the zoo at night instead of waiting for the train and it was sooo much better. Getting a chance to see the animals at night, feeding and walking through the enclosures was breath taking. Being able to hear them at night and see them feed was worth the walk. Definitely worth a visit!!"
,,Visit to Night Safari (Singapore),4.0,,"The zoo is way crowded than I've expected. We're unable to watch earlier slots of Animal show due to full house. Hence we schedule our visit as such:
1.Explore via walking (took abt 1.5hrs)
2. Animal show
3. Tram ride

Exploration via walking
We explored the entire animal attractions with the map.
Its was an interesting walk where we get to see animals never seen before. Its quite an eye opening. You need some luck in order to see all the animals in the safari. The animals may go into hiding and all you can do is to squint your eyes trying to find the animal.

Animal show
As we completed the 'treking', the path brought us back to the starting point and by then it abt 10.15pm. We manage to get to the Animal Show this time round. The show Emcee is jovial and humerous. The contents are definitely educational.

Tram ride
We took the tram ride after the show. The crowds are gone and we get to enjoy the ride in a quieter environment. The tram took us on a journey not accessible by walking which we took earlier. Animals are indeed out in the open. Some of them are really close by; just hanging by the roadside. The guide on the train introduce the animals clearly and fed us with educational info. Its a good way to end the visit after the long walking.

Visiting Night Safari is definitely not a thrilling trip like other attractions. However, it set a different kind of tempo and makes you take a step back to look at the world and enjoy the peace at night. Be patience as one may not always be lucky to see the animals. Be open minded to the educational sharing by the attraction."
,,Nice and quick,4.0,,"1 hour night safari (30 min show and 30 drive).

Nice activity for the kids. Book in advance if you want to choose your time. They have 7:15 8:15 9:15 and 10:15pm. Book online a day or 2 in advance.

30 minutes drive from the center. You have fast food restaurants there and many pther attractions.

During the safari you see many animals and you can choose to walk also."
,,Night safari is cool,4.0,,"A quick and cool night activity for the kids. You start with a 30 minutes show involving a few animals. And then a 30 minutes night safari where you can see many animals if you are lucky. Tigers lions elephants etc...

Its a good night activity with the kids and it is 30 minutes away from the city center in cab."
,,Good to visit,5.0,,"If you like adventure and animals then do visit this place. Night safari basically starts after 6:30 PM, it hosts a fir show and some shows showcasing animals performing stunts. These shows are a must watch. Also go for the safari tour where you get to see various wild animals from across the world. But please be informed that you are not supposed to keep the flash lights on while taking snaps. Please be thoughtful about it, and do visit this place to have an entirely new experience with the animals in open."
,,Night safari,4.0,,Visited in evening time. Its not like must see attraction you can skip this. They took us on tram train which passes from middle of jungle we can see different animals. This is my opinion. If you have time you can visit it.
,,It may not attract Indian Visitors as more than 80% animals are Indian.. Nothing new to see..,3.0,,"Night Safari is ok, i mean one can avoid this if one is from India and already visited some good zoo like Mysore zoo etc, and its in night so u may not get good or proper view of Animals and Photography is not possible at all..
There is nothing new to offer there, some show is good otherwise nothing else that may appeal to Indian Tourist...
So for us it was like boring"
,,A must see,5.0,,"A Singapore visit with children? Visit the night safari, easy to access, save place perfect finish of a sightseeing tour. Always again"
,,Must visit,5.0,,The night safari is an excellent tourist activity. Totally value for money. However I would advise you to purchase your tickets online rather than in the counters. Purchasing online is cheaper by around 10$
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Very well maintained zoo, the night safari is a must visit. One advise would be to buy the tickets online, its around 10$ cheaper than the entrance. It's a must visit if travelling with children."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Ticket prices are very expensive considering that there is really nothing much for visitors to see. Not worth going.
,,Singapore zoo in night,4.0,,It's an basically Singapore zoo in night . One time watch. If you don't have enough time you can ignore it . Its have an limited animals .Not much worth. 2-3 hours worth of time
,,Don't Miss It,5.0,,"I'm glad I went to the Night Safari, more wild animals to see, and it has its special atmosphere. I highly recommend it"
,,Lots of animals to be seen,4.0,,"Book your ticket online and get $5 off the entrance fee. Pre book night safari. Saw close up tiger, lion, zebra, bull elephants, etc. At night it's not so hot and you do see lots of animals. Give yourself time to walk around so you have time to spend looking. The hyena enclosure first pass was hard to see any but second pass had a pack of about 6-7 very active. Catch the show, it's entertaining and you can get some pictures up close with animals."
,,Holidays,5.0,,"Very nice view of Singapore at night Worth it Went to visit the Raffles HOtel, Tried the Singapore sling as well,a local alcoholic drink"
,,Amazing,5.0,,It was amazing experience with my family and friends. We truly enjoyed here ... thank you Night Safari team to make our experience memorable..
,,"Night Safari, expensive but good.",5.0,,"We booked on line, to save $9 (10%) for two adults. This let you pick your time, we were not sure what time we would arrive so booked for 8:15, but arrive early 7:00, so needed to wait around until 8pm, there are shops and a bar, but these were expensive, a bottle of beer was $13.50. They would not let us enter early or change the time on the tickets.

You could just turn up and pay, but you run the risk of all the tickets being sold out.

I advise you book the earlier ticket of 7:15, and you can still enter until 8:00, giving you a 45min window. The queue for the first entry was manic, and they waited until 7:15 before opening the gates.

The rides and the shows were not very well synchronised, this may depend on when you entered, on entry you had option to wait for 30mins for the live show or queue to get on the train ride.

We went for the train, having waited around to get in, when the train got back the show had started and the next show was already full, which meant a 90 min wait.

The train was good, but very busy, and when people were trying to take photos with phones, which most people do, it does cause you to lose your night vision, making it difficult to see in the darker area.

Some of the animals were roaming free and the train passes within touching distance, although these were farm type animals, rather than wild.

I recommend walking, you got closer to the animals, especially the Tiger, who was sleeping against the glass of the enclosure.

You could not get to see the elephant on foot.

Going a night was more atmospheric, a lot of the animals being nocturnal were being fed, and it was cooler walking around.

Look out for offers on line, the day after we visited the priced dropped 25%, from$45 to $33.

The walks around the zoo take about 20mins for each zone, there are a few steps but some steep inclines. There good is Wheel chair access."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"We liked this place a lot. The 40 mins tram ride allows you to see comparatively a lot of animals. Also if you go on the 4 walking trails you will have an option to see various animals quite close to you ( of course with the right precautionary measures taken as per the exhibit ).
If I were to choose between Singapore zoo, river safari, jurong bird park and night safari, my options would be night safari, bird park and probably skip the other 2."
,,Better night than day,3.0,,"If I'm going to a zoo in Singapore I may as well escape the heat and go at night. Super expensive and a bit odd as you zip through the zoo on a motorized trolley while kids play on their phones.

Nice elephant but average overall."
,,Must do,5.0,,Must do in Singapore. Best Value-For-Money night-trip. Mind that you can reach there by taxi (expensive) or go to the nearest subway station and grab a bus there.
,,A good way to see animals in their natural environment,4.0,,The Night Safari is located separately from the Singapore Zoo and is open during the evening hours of darkness. The animals are nocturnal and are apparently best seen at night. The viewing is done from a small mobile railway which winds it's way through the zoo area. There is a good range of creatures whose living space is just illuminated enough for the visitors to see them. We enjoyed the visit at about 9:00pm.
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Interesting concept to have a safari at night. The place is well organised though a bit far from town so plan in advance in terms of timings otherwise you could be in for a long night.

Would have been better if our safari bus hadn't broken down."
,,Not worth the visit,1.0,,"We were looking forward to this after reading previous reviews however upon getting there (an hour from central Singapore) we were faced with long queues for the pre show and then queueing again for the safari.
The show was better suited for children not so much adults. The safari was ok. Definitely not worth the journey and the queuing.
Overall very disappointed and the entrance fees were overpriced."
,,Good infra and concept,4.0,,One time visist as its aq unique experience. Its best to avoid the zoo and river safari as these are all repetitions and if you are not much into animals and dont have young children
,,Good See,3.0,,Its a good place to have fun & watch animals. You can either see the entire place walking or by the tram.
,,Good fun,4.0,,"we assumed that by the word 'safari' it meant 'out in the open, in the animals natural habitat'. We then learned, just before the bus picked us up, that this is infact a zoo. We nervously laughed for about ten minutes and wondered what the hell we'd booked on to.
The bus picks you up from your hotel and then drops you in the gardens by the bay, where you pay for your tickets if you haven't already done so or just collect a sticker and wait for the main bus to take you there.
A guide comes with you and tells you what will happen and what you'll see when you get there.
You are given a fast track sticker which allows you to get on the first available tram. Thd trams are open sided and approx 4-5 carriages long. There is a recording thats plays as you go around and although we were really apprehensive, it was actually very good! We saw every single animal on the list! And only the Tiger was behind a window. Everything else was in an open enclosure (does that even make sense). All of the animal's are separated from each other but able to roam around in their own areas.
Once the tram stops, you can get off and walk around the park. This is where you will see some things that are in enclosures, like smaller wild cats etc.
When you get back to the main entrance their are tons of food places and I think they do shows but wd missed those.
The bus then takes you straight back to your hotel.
I would recomend this place but just be warned that it isn't really a safari, more of a zoo."
,,Very enjoyable.,4.0,,You have an allocated time to enter so get there on time. I recommend doing the show first and then having a wander around. You can get the tram around and hop off at certain points to have a look around if you want.
,,Fun trail,4.0,,"The night safari was quite enjoyable. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The animal handlers were knowledgeable about the animals. The lady telling the stories about the animals was extremely funny and made the experience a lot of fun. Thereafter I took a tram ride through the animal trail and saw various wild animals found in various regions in the world. Although it was at night there was sufficient lighting and I was able to take photos without using the flash light of the camera which is prohibited so as not to scare or startle the animals. The Safari was fun although it cannot match the wildlife safaris in Kenya where I come from. In Kenya we are able to see the animals in their natural habitat within the various national game parks, reserves and conservancies."
,,Interesting,5.0,,Well worth a visit. Plenty of nocturnal animals to see roaming around either from the train or walking paths.
,,"Wow, wow, wow and some tiny otters!",5.0,,"Visited the night safari yesterday and what a trip!
The must sees are the tiny otters and the cloud leopards - what an experience to be so close to these amazing animals! It truly feels like you are roaming in the wild! Some of the dark corners on the tram ride really make you uncertain about where the next AMAZING beast is going to come from! And the cloud leopard scared us all by leaping out!
The giant flying squirrels are a must see and don't be worried - there are two lots of doors before you are in their habitat! And they didn't even fly at our heads so don't worry.
Try to catch the creatures of the night show - we sadly missed it as the posters said 10:30 so we were heading to it then but apparently this was only weekends so watch out for that.
If your lucky like us you will see the lions roar!"
,,A different view at Night,4.0,,"You do need to book in advance for this one. It was really busy when we went and the queues to get in were very long even though we had pre-booked. Travelling around on a little ""train"" is easy but to make the most of the visit you must get off at the first stop and follow the path to see the animals - this was definitely the best way to see everything."
,,Awesome,5.0,,This was make you own way there I came from day tour from Malaysia so booked a later in night entry. This still left plenty of time to take a tram ride and see the shows or utilise one of many eating foods on sight. Shows were great a must see activity if you have a spare night it won't disappoint
,,Expensive for what is was,2.0,,There could have been more added to the trip and for the cost off. You could not see all the animals because of the lack of lighting and the speed of the driver once half the guest got off
,,Interesting but maybe a bit disappointing for Adults only visits,3.0,,The animal show is best suited for young families. The tram at night to view nocturnal Animals was interesting.
,,Dark,4.0,,"We went on a tour, including dinner. The dinner was buffet, but for a large group, it needs to be. A tram took us around the park, and as it was night time, it was a little hard to see some of the animals, but it was a nice contrast to a regular zoo visit."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"It was an amazing experience. It is a must do thing in Singapore, do not miss this. You will like what you experience."
,,One of the best zoos I've ever been to.,5.0,,"And I've done a few... San Diego, North Carolina Zooligical Park, Ueno Zoo Tokyo, National Zoo and Aquarium in Australia and this one is right up there with them. I recommend doing the night safari while on your visit. Amazing show to get you ready in the staging area and the safari itself was worth the money!"
,,Waste of Money,1.0,,"This was my tourist attraction of choice, read about it on line and was really looking forward to my visit for months. What a disappointment, first it was separate to Singapore zoo, second you were not allowed to take photographs, thirdly there was not much to see. The train trip lasted about 20 minutes. The entry fee was S$45, however we found out afterwards that you could buy a 4 way ticket, which did the zoo, the night safari and two other attractions. It is also a long way out of the city and a costly cab ride each way."
,,"One of its kind, Must visit",5.0,,"Book online, try to get the first entry tickets around 7 pm.
Watched the fire show 15mts prior entry.
Upon entry head for the creatures of the night show(do not miss it) and the leisurely proceed to the tram ride.
40 Mts ride is enjoyable and is an experience you would relish.
Refrain from flash photography inside, the park rangers are awesome and helpful.
After the tram ride do take the foot trails, it is amazing to go around in night, sufficiently lit to maintain the ambience.
If you are doing all three parks on the same day, young children will be sleepy by the time you are at night Safari and will not be able to enjoy it.
Last bus is around midnight, taxi available frequently, if you enter by 7 pm expect to be out by 10.30 pm.
Dinner and restaurants are in the expensive side, Ensure you carry enough cash/cards"
,,Up close and personal with the animals,4.0,,My second visit to the night safari; I have to say it gets better every time. We got to be a couple of feet away from the animals and experience them in a very natural setting. Photographs are almost impossible as it is just too dark and flash is not allowed. Deer were so close that if I had reached out a hand i could have touched one. Lovely and unique experience. Food and souvenirs are expensive. Huge queues for tram rides but we skipped this as we came with the hotel s special package offer with pick up and drop. This is convenient especially if you are new to the country.
,,This is a must see.,5.0,,"This zoo is very interesting as you see animals fairly close up, and they do not appear to be disturbed by people. The range of animals are large, and the organisation very well done. Recommend a visit."
,,Disappointing Night Safari,3.0,,"This did not live up to expectations. This is one of the ""must see"" on the list of ""to dos"". However, we both were disappointed with the visit. The vehicle was travelling a bit fast, which made it difficult to see the animals. The lighting also was not adequate to really see some of the creatures. The show after the tour did not live up to expectations as well when compared to what is offered in the USA."
,,A new and exciting safari.,4.0,,"This is a very good idea and a exciting safari. Get ready with full length clothes and mosquito repellent for a fun visit to the night zoo. There is a show which is very informative on the nocturnal creatures and also the tram ride is comfortable. But, if you have visited the animals in the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad, then the animals are the same. It is much better than the zoo which is open in the day hours. There are 4 trails and we went to all of them. This safari is a must visit place of Singapore."
,,Excellent tour with interesting perspective of zoo,4.0,,"We booked the tour through Viator and found it to be a good choice, with Asian buffet and priority tram access. Only disappointment was that some animals were hard to see in dim light, although we understood completely why the light had to be dim. Good variety of animals from many areas of the world and much cooler at night."
,,Novel and fun,4.0,,"Wear comfortable shoes, use a mosquito repellent patch and be prepared for the crowds esp on weekend nights. It opens at 715pm till midnight. Must catch the Creatures of the Night show which is at 730pm, 830pm, 930pm and 1030pm. There are limited seats in the amphitheatre so to ensure you get a seat, good to go at least 20mins early and join the line.
The tram ride is great - very informative and good sightings of animals.
The trails are great. There are four to choose from. We did the wallaby trail which allows you to walk through the wallaby enclosure. The Leopard trail was great too.
Lots of helpful guides along the way so even though it's a little dark, you feel safe and comfortable."
,,Great!,5.0,,This is different from any other zoo visit - great service and nice to see the animals looking to happy in their enclosures
,,Definitely an unusual attraction,5.0,,"Most zoos close their doors before the sun sets. This portion of the zoo begins to thrive after sundown. Best way to see nocturnal animals. We had a skip the line pass for the tram although it wasn't all that busy the night we went. On busy nights you can spend a lot of time in line. We had dinner there which was a buffet and just average. The animals of the night show was fine if you're like 12, otherwise skip it and take one or more of the walking trails."
,,Loved this,5.0,,"Did a double visit, the Singapore zoo in the afternoon followed by the night zoo, well at night.
Initially we got the tram/shuttle service around the site and after that decided to walk around again, which gave us chance to see things not on the shuttle route. Really nice to get up close to the animals, without the restriction of glass, bars or cages. A particular highlight was walking through the Walaby enclosure and being close enough to touch them. Zoo's aren't normally my thing, possibly because I've been brought up visiting zoo's with caged animals or animals behind bars, but this zoo is different, at time it feels like you can actually touch the animals and in fact walk among them.

Outside the zoo enclosure is decent waiting area with shops and a couple of cafes/food venues.

Highly recommended visit."
,,Decent place to visit,4.0,,"The trip starts with some dancing in front of the gate, and we can only access at specific time. The zoo is separated with two zones, one zone for taking trails and others for riding cars. Basically, we are able to visit both zones. However, it's so dark with a lot of mosquitos so we must be well-equipped with insect repellent. We will see a lots of night animals. One the most interesting is feeding the otter. Actually, it's not an official activity but I asked the zookeeper to do that. It's amazing scene when dozen of otters come out for the food. We can explore by car ride, with the information provided by tour guide. Highly recommended for family. Should buy Singapore pass to explore this zoo as well three other zoos."
,,Dont expect to see a lot of animals,3.0,,Somehow I expected more so I was a bit disappointed. I have been to a moonlight/night time zoo before and I was expecting something similar. I think there are just too many tourists. We queued up for around 20 minutes before it opened. Then we were herded in to a holding yard where we waited for approximately 15 minutes for our open air buses. Everyone was hot and sweaty. The guide was good but the woman behind me insisted on taking several pictures with a flash which was not allowed and caused the driver to stop the bus and threaten to cancel the tour if she didn't stop. The tour was nice and we saw a number of animals. But not a lot. We then walked to see a show in a packed amphitheatre where more idiots took photos with flashes despite being told it could permanently damage the eyes of the animals. All the flashes made me irritated. After that we went past the gift shop and eateries and caught a taxi back to our accommodation at Orchid Country Club. OCC is the closest accommodation to the zoo. It is not the type of thing I would go to twice.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Must visit. You can skip the zoo, as you see almost all the animals in night safari. Well behaved staff. Comfortable buses/trams."
,,one of the best night zoos,5.0,,highly recommended if you want to see noctural animals in their natural habitat. we took the tram but if you walk you can see more.
,,Ok if u have time,3.0,,Probably more of a family thing. I was surprised how small the living areas were for a lot of the animals
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"The night safari is a balanced decision.

On the one hand, it is clearly more difficult and less certain that you will get to see some of the animals/exhibits due to the dark conditions. On the other, there are many nocturnal creatures which are more readily observed after nightfall.

There is also an element of surrealism - slightly spooky to an extent - while traveling between exhibits (either using the train transporter or afoot along the pathways).

There are several 'shows' for entertainment which to some extent help to complete the experience.

To me, one of the key benefits was that the temperature and humidity at night were much more comfortable.

Food outlets were many and varied but with the usual caveats - they were expensive and nutritionally challenged, and due to the isolation, once inside, the safari participant is captive to the available fare.

Overall, something a bit different and pleasant."
,,"started with a bang, ended with dissappointment",2.0,,"The night starts with some fire breathers/dance, which were great and got you excited for what was to come. However, that was exciting as you got. After you make you way to train cars that take you around the zoo, you saw hardly anything, lighting was poor, and you could hardly see any animals, nothing. Basically like a car ride in the dark. Was very disappointing. Didn't see much at all, concept was good, so thought was waste of money. Concept is good, but needs to be reviewed to get the animal experience."
,,1 time only (and enough!),2.0,,"Arrived late (maybe that's why i missed the shows??)... was worrying i cannot tour the whole place within just 2 hours...

took the tram ride, nothing much to see, when tram ride end, it stop you at the exit so you can go straight to the gift shop! very good planning ($$$$$)! The whole sighting is only about 1 hour! Not much food option... and overpriced for sub-standard food! if you are already at the zoo, then maybe its okay to drop by.. if you have to come all the way, i suggest don't waste your time and $$$!"
,,Night Safari in Singapore,5.0,,"As we know Night Safari in Singapore is very attractive tourist spot, I was very interested to enjoy the adventure with my family.Finally I got the opportunity to get the experience of night safari, before starting the adventure, there was a fire show performed by two persons which was unbelievable and unforgettable. Lastly,we have seen live animal like Elephant,Tiger, Lioness Monkey and many more.The forest is really nice and found adventurous. If I go again to Singapore, I will go night safari once again. In my opinion it is a must visit item for tourist."
,,"It's not a safari, it's a zoo without cages.",2.0,,"The animals are delimited by water pits, it's like a zoo but without cages. The animals are brought from different places of Asia. There is an animal show too, where the animals are obliged to do things. It is nice only for people who like zoos."
,,Boring for couples!!,2.0,,Well we visited there for tramp tour to see animals. Mostly all the animals were sleeping hard luck!! We were not allowed to take pictures with flash and at night it was difficult to take pictures. For us it was very slow and boring. May be exciting for kids. I'll not recommend it to couples.
,,Loved the place,5.0,,"I went to this place with my family. We loved the fire show they do before the entry starts. The safari was an awesome experience. Also saw the night animals show that happens on holidays/weekends. That was nice too.
Loved the tram ride they take you in. No flash photography is something that all need to take care of."
,,Once is enough,2.0,,"Kids love to see the animals. However, next time may as well go to the zoo during daytime. I went to the regular zoo and was a lot better tahnthis one. During my visit, one of the shows was suspended. And even though I have an option to walk on the trails, I was not sure whether it was suitable for small kids. Food, especially Korean food, was bad and overpriced."
,,Magical place,5.0,,"We visited the Night Safari on a tour booked through Viator/Tour East.
We had dinner to start the trip at the Ulu Ulu buffet restaurant, fantastic food, lots of variety & good quality.
We took the tram ride first of all, and it did not disappoint, I was concerned that we wouldn't see many animals, but we saw every single type. The animals were so close to the tram route that we had fantastic views of them and the habitats they were in were very realistic and large, so did not give it the feel of a 'zoo'. I've seen reviews where people are complaining about not being able to use the flash on their cameras - this is common sense so that the animals aren't startled/blinded and you should immerse yourself in the experience rather than trying to photograph everything. The commentary as you pass by the animals is very interesting. If you are visiting the park not through a tour company, the queues for the tram during busy times can span for hours - with the pre-booked tours with Tour East you can skip the queues and board a tram immediately.
The walking trails were also enjoyable, again we saw lots of the animals as we walked through. The only downside of the pre-arranged tour is we didn't have enough time to do both walking trails.
The creatures of the night show was brilliant, very informative with enthusiastic staff, interesting nocturnal animals and audience interaction.
All in all I would 100% recommend the Night Safari for adults and children alike. The downside to the booked tour is that you don't have extra time to just wander around as timings are quite strict, however the Night safari is difficult to access by public transport and taxi's are likely expensive. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, this was a very unique experience not like a typical zoo or wildlife park."
,,Night safari is the best way to enjoy it,4.0,,"The night safari trip is available and it offers a new experience with respect to the other zoos we ever visited. First you go around on a wheeled train and then, after you returned to the start, you can explore it on foot through different paths.

The tiger is amazing!"
,,Not worth it,2.0,,This trip was not very good as we didn't see many animals and it was rushed. Couldn't use flash on camera so pictures awful. Animal show poor.
,,family friendly,3.0,,"kids loves it but i would have liked to have been able to see more, as they were hard to see but educational"
,,Lovely Experiance,4.0,,Took a booking with Viator including private ride & dinner & really enjoyed dinner at ILU-ILU resurant & ride in the park.
,,Bring insect repellent.,4.0,,Excellent show with well-trained animals. Pleasant walk through the trails when few people are around. You can cheaper tickets through an agency (e.g. Somewhere in Chinatown).
,,worth visiting and exloring. may not suitable for too young kids or kids that afraid of dark,3.0,,"went there on 26-Nov with 3 kids. since 7.15pm slot sold out, we took the 8.15pm. Our older kids (9 y/o) enjoyed the visit but the 5yo did not.
If you travel with young kids, my advise is enter the park earlier. (best is 7.15pm) slot. because it will be too tiring for kids if you enter at later time. we spend about 2 hours for this visit, tram ride and watch the show.

we took the tram ride, and did not go on foot trail. as kids are afraid of dark. The animals in the park can come up close near you even we are on the tram. that is incredible experience. you get to the wonders of the creator who created all different species of animals which you hardly tell their names.

Enjoy seeing with your eye and don't bother about taking pictures as it will be too dark for you to take a nice shot. There are frequent reminders not to use flash light as it is harmful for animals eye. So be co-operative and mindful as many eyes will be watching at you if you use flash.

Must not forget the excellent tram guide Damien (may spell wrongly) who guided us along the ride, telling the visitors stories and description of different animals. He has make the tram ride enjoyable and educational one.

Can see that the management took quite an effort in maintaining the park and care for the wild life animals (by visiting, you also contribute to the park maintenance cost. giggle.). thumbs up for all the team in night safari."
,,First in the world!,5.0,,"I am proud as a Singaporean that the Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore!

The Night Safari currently houses over 2,500 animals representing over 130 species, of which 38% are threatened species.

Also a good place to bring your foreign friends to and to really experience the safari at night without even going to Africa!"
,,Most amazing,5.0,,From the minute I read about this in a travel guide I knew I had to visit. It was the most amazing evening attraction I have ever visited. Chance to see animals in very low light there is a vehicle tour with an audio commentary. Once the tour has ended you are free then to walk through various footpaths among the animal enclosures. You are in a rainforest in the dark and it's really really hot and you can hear animals around you and frogs and insects ........there are no words to describe how amazing it was .
,,Subjective review so YOU decide if you want to go out not. I'm glad I did.,4.0,,"Well I stopped reading reviews, because I just cannot fathom the stupidity of some people making comments like ""there's moats and wires"" and ""they seemed to force the animals to stay awake..."" Geeze people. It's a zoo. A lot of these animals are dangerous and must be contained, and forcing nocturnal animals to stay awake at night? FFS.

I spent three enjoyable hours at the zoo right next door, then (wasted my time on) the river safari, after which I enjoyed the Amazon River Quest, and finally the night safari (after waiting 1.5 hours on site for the sun to go down!) my feet were killing me at the end.

All these attractions are all side by side, and can be a little confusing (especially the boat part). The food and beverages on site are ridiculously over priced. Bring your own. But of course they understand this, with signs around all the eateries ""no outside food"". Nothing stopping you munching on your fare one you get inside..... $13 for a regular tiger beer! I don't think so.

But on to the actual night safari. Personally I'm a bit torn between caging wild animals for our entertainment; I get this feeling of barbarism, but guilty of contributing to it by going. However, the way these animals are presented is thoughtful. They all seemed content enough, and I do see the tremendous importance of education so we can do what we can to preserve them. The venue certainly promoted preservation and education, and indeed have very successful breeding programs. Can't do better than that, because some they are being successfully are on the endangered list. For these reasons, I support this concept. The staff there are all so happy and helpful, which added to the experience. ESPECIALLY Ogy and her Daughter, who rely went above and beyond. You both are a credit and asset to the N. S. not to mention great ambassadors for all Singaporeans!

I do recommend the attraction, and if you have kids, would say that if you can keep their energy going at this hour, it is a must visit. For adults, hey, it's a night zoo, and there are not a lot of opportunities to see these animals at night, in such a well presented, impeccably clean way. The negative reviews I believe are from visitors with unrealistic expectations."
,,Night safari,4.0,,One must definetly visit the night safari option at singapore zoo. There are 4 zoos located at all 4 corners of Singapore city. Future plan is to merge all one at one place. The night safari gets crowded over weekend so plan ahead. Get a good camera that captures in night and moving objects as I could not take many pics while going in tram. Best part it's all open and uncaged. Yes the animals are all uncaged and a tram slowly chucks down the wild with online commentary on each of the species. Saw a baby elephant and it just stole my heart so adorable.
,,Great night out,5.0,,"I went to the night zoo as part of a holiday in Singapore.
I found transport to the zoo complicated and the various public transport options all looked tricky and slow. In the end we used Uber to get there and I think this was ideal.
First we went to the creatures of the night show, which was very well done. After some posing for pictures with the animal actors, on to the train ride around the park. There were also some walking routes.
Overall I thought this was a brilliant opportunity to see the animals up close and behaving in a way that they would not hand been during the day."
,,Incredible!,5.0,,This was an incredible night adventure to see nocturnal animals in a habitat that was made for them. The fruit bats were especially cool to see and up close too.. There were hyenas were also most interesting as there were several to see.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"This is very unique experience , must visit for children's , very well organised , showing animal habitat differently"
,,Can skip,3.0,,Well its one of the must visit places in Singapore as the whole concept seems amazing but its over hyped . Its very dark and you cant see many of the animals
,,Its a zoo people,3.0,,"Sorry. I don't like zoos so my review is tainted. Also had a crappy meal at the Bongo Burger joint out the front. The food inside looked to be better offerings than outside choices. My daughter who has been starved of zoo action due to my thoughts on them did enjoy herself- although was way too tired by the end of it.
We went on a Sunday....there were no queues to get tickets and entry times had gone out the window..no need to regulate as not enough people.
Tip is to do walks first then catch the tram when there isn't any lines. We actually walked down to the bottom via night fishers walk then caught the tram back up from the bottom station.
We caught the MRT on the red line to Ang Mo Kio then bus 138 to the zoo. Easy & cheap ( off peak fares = abt $5 ea rtn). Took about an hour though from Orchard. Our friends took a taxi. About $25 each way and half an hour."
,,Family fun,4.0,,"Carefully curated animal place, covers most of the big animals from the asian sub-continent. Well-laid out place and the audio-visual presentation in the carts is crisp and precise.. worth a visit if you are traveling with family."
,,A miss won't let you down,3.0,,"This is one place which has been hyped and if you miss it, you won't miss much, in fact nothing. We arrived at the night safari with high expectations but what we got was definitely disappointing. We were quick to get tram seats (full of excitement) but that's it. Once the journey started, excitement started fading and took the form of disappointment. The tram takes us through gated animal enclosures wherein either animals are resting or curious as the tram arrives. big trenches are present between the driveway and animals like elephant, lion, tigers and other casual animals just lie there as we pass through like deer, buffalo. In fact we were feeling bad as animals were unable to rest, in some enclosures, as the tram arrived, lights were switched on so that we may view the animals, but it's nothing like safari, what the word actually means. The only exciting part was the 15-20 minutes animal show, which again was not as good as the ones in the Singapore zoo during the day. in summary, if one has covered Singapore zoo and river safari during the day, one can give night safari a miss, instead plan to tour around the night life / streets of Singapore."
,,"Less a safari, more a fancy zoo",3.0,,"We went here as a family with senior citizens and an infant. Most of the family members enjoyed this place. I thought it was more hype than actual substance.
We did river safari earlier in the day before coming to night safari. The river safari closes at about 6 PM and the night safari opens at 7:15 PM. So usually people manage to grab a bite at one of the over priced restaurants in the area just outside the night safari entrance. The night safari is located in quite a remote area of the city and as such there're no eating options in the immedaite vicinity outside the park. So you're forced to eat at the park (unless of course you've taken your own food with you).
The night safari tickets are primarily for a tram ride that takes you through the park. You're allowed to enter the park anytime AFTER the time mentioned on your ticket. I'd advice to enter after 8 PM if possible, as that will help avoid the opening time heavy rush. You can probably have a meal in that time.
So we entered the park around 7:30 PM. Had to wade through quite a huge line (about 15 min of wait time). Their trams keep running every 2-3 min or so. The tram is open and takes you through the enclosures of different animals. Even though the animals are not enclosed in tight cages, there're moats and thin wire meshes that do make you wonder if it's a fancy zoo. I've done numerous wild life safari trips and I can vouch that this was not a safari. Nevertheless, people who haven't been on wildlife trips and children are bound to enjoy this.
The tram moves slowly through the enclosures and being in Singapore it becomes quite stuffy and hot. This could be a problem for those with infants.
Once the tram ride was over we came out of the park. After a not so short wait of 15 min at the taxi stand (and 2-3 refusals from taxi drivers to come to our area), we managed to get a taxi and reach home.
The conclusion would be that it is more hyped but could still be enjoyable if you've not been to a wild life safari before."
,,FIELD TRIP NIGHT,5.0,,"i absolutely love it here. you can see animals in their habitat at night. Singapore is warm but since the activity is at night its cooler than other touristy activities in your itinerary.

The staff are friendly & the kids simply love the experience. I liked it a lot too, its y 2nd time there but im constantly amazed by what i see.

There is a tram ride, night trails and a show. I feel like im going to a field trip. Its always a happy night for me here. I highly recommend this for those whod go to SG"
,,its a novelty but can miss,3.0,,The Animals seemed kinda dull tired or perhaps forced to stay awake. I just felt a tad guilty keeping them awake. Also the Zoo is a much better place to see the animals and enjoy them
,,Live Fire n Animal Show,4.0,,"The fire show was real excitement to watch.. The live animal show was cute, n conducted very nicely.. It was an exp to view animals at night in the tram as well as thru walk"
,,"Night Safari, Singapore - a must visit",4.0,,The night safari was a delightful experience. You can view the animals at a close distance. It appears as if the animals are out in the open. The wafer thin mesh is hardly visible to the eye. You are taken around in an open golf cart kind of vehicle and there is an option to step out and follow specific trails. You can hop on the next cart that passes to continue. Unique experience and very well organized and well kept!
,,Really enjoyable,5.0,,This is so different from seeing the zoo during the day. So many animals come to life at night. The little train to take you around is great but there are also walks which take on a different atmosphere at night. Kids will love it.
,,nice place to see animals x,4.0,,make sure you get down the tram and visit the trails like the leopard trail wallaby trail.. the tram ride is for 40 mins
,,Great fun for family,4.0,,My family enjoyed ourselves at night safari especially night show. Rides was smooth and fun. Learnt lot of animals living habits.
,,Enjoyable evening at the zoo,4.0,,The night zoo was a nice way to spend the evening. The tour was well narrated and informative. The information with the exhibits was very good.
,,more hype than substance,3.0,,a good place to see but not worth the extra hype that it creates. It is just a place to see animals at night. Nothing beyond that.
,,recommended for kids,5.0,,"its quite nice but i beleieve its more for kids, most of the animals were sleeping, but a nice experience"
,,Great experience for everyone...,5.0,,"It's a must watch activity in Singapore, In this you would be able to see almost all the animals in their natural habitat. The animals are so trained here, that they sit just next to the lamps that everyone can see them clearly :)"
,,An amazing experience!,5.0,,"I went to the Night Safari on a Thursday evening. After buying my tickets, reasonably inexpensive given the duration of the evening, we were treated to a fire show at the entrance to the zoo.
The zoo itself is very well planned out, with trails you can walk along by yourself or you can take a safari buggy.
We took the safari buggy first of all, and the driver's commentary was excellent. We saw all types of local creatures as well as the expected lions, tigers and hyenas. The fact that there are very few glass cages, and the majority of the animals are free to wander their enclosure, made it a much nicer than your average zoo experience.
Walking around the trails later was also a great experience, hearing the animals and seeing them close up.
A truly brilliant experience and one I highly recommend!"
,,Great night out,5.0,,"We did the dinner and tour, we all had a great night. Amazing food and it was great to be able to see so many night animals"
,,Good fun if the animals are in a good mood,4.0,,"Great place to take your kids to, & for three reasons:
1. It open's in the night, & there are a few choices for these hours, especially if you have small kids :-)
2. The whole forest ambiance is very nice & the kids will have a blast!
3. It's different from any other regular zoo that your kids would have seen before.
The flip side is that you should be there as early as possible, at like 7:15 pm when the park opens, as you stand lesser chance of seeing the animals as the night gets darker (they need rest too, right?). You can be done with all the activitiy in 3 hours, including a quick dinner (good desi stuff available too)."
,,Interesting concept but very Disney-esque. Disappointing,2.0,,"Interestingly developed attraction - essentially a night time zoo. Interesting animals and for some of them one is able to get quite close. It is however, very Disney-esque (restaurants, theme-park shops, trams) and that made it very disappointing. I don't think it is worth the effort it takes to get there."
,,night at the zoo,4.0,,This was my first experience to the zoo visit during night.....new to me as well...the zoo opens by 6pm...and there stands a great queue.....lengthy one.......during the wait you can relax yourself by the performance of tribes....fire dance the name calls.....then after getting inside....you can choose a tram ride.....or get yourself into a trek walk......both are worth it......trek walk in the night can be scary if you are going alone....and afraid of dark....as well do not miss any shows they all worth watching......there are restaurants to satisfy your hunger...but my preference is get your self some sandwich...chips and water from your starting place...that may come under your budget......
,,Amazing and unforgettable experience,5.0,,"This is just next to the zoo.. but completely separate.. the barriers seemed to melt away in the darkness. The 45 minute tram ride is with a guide whose commentary is a good introduction to the park.

There is a creatures of the night show which the kids loved.

And if you can take a walk through the East Lodge Trail it is an unforgettable experience.

Do avoid weekends - it gets insanely crowded and go for the first session - book well in advance and remember to take the bus around 10.35 pm to make it to the last MRT train from Ang Mo Kio at 11.35 pm"
,,Fun Evening with Nocturnal Animals,5.0,,"this is lots of fun. They have a great layout so that your eyes adjust to the low lighting and you get to see nocturnal animals out and about. The layout is such that you don't feel like you're looking at caged animals (for the most part).
Skip the show... for 5 minutes of interesting animal information/viewing you spend 60 min waiting in line and hearing corny jokes. Might be fun if you have small kids."
,,"Book your tickets in advance, and go to the first session",4.0,,"We went on the weekend and it was insanely full. We booked ahead for the 7.15 session which was just as well as it was sold out (and waiting an hour with our two small kids would have been hell).

We really enjoyed the park, its a 5 star zoo but so crazy busy with long lines it does detract from it a little bit."
,,Fun place to see.,5.0,,"Here is the issue, it opens at 7 pm. If you get there at 7 it's crowded, but don't wait to long. The place takes a while to go through. The tram is fun, but do the walks. It's dark on the paths , but fun. If you take the train and bus, it's very cheap, but does take the 1 plus to get there, up to 1 hour and half. The last bus leaves at 12:15 am. The last train ends at 11:45 or so. See the problem. We took the 11:00pm bus, cut the park short, made on train half way into the city. Then the train closes you have to get off and fine a taxi, which isn't hard or expenses just unexpected.
Other than that the night safari is great."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"We went there with out 6 yr old kid and she was mesmerised by the quality of this tour. Only dark spot is the ""animal show"" where the animators speak a bit too much and animals are kept a secondary roles. But overall , very interesting"
,,Good for kids,4.0,,This is the place to go with kids. They have different alivies with animals and even a water park for children inside. My baby loved it and we enjoyed the walk.
,,Worth it!,4.0,,"At the door it was around £30 each adult for access to the entire park - thats the river safari and night safari. Worth every penny from a tourist perspective. You get to see some great oriental animals such as the Malaysian Tapir and Purple Ostrich and they look well cared for. You can either go in a safari style caddy or have a walk through. Many shops and afew good places to eat. Nice little day out, took around 4 hours in total to cover the whole park"
,,Our night in the que,1.0,,"Well unfortunately thats 2 hours of my life that i wont be getting back. I really dont enjoy the privilege of paying to stand in a que for most of the evening whilst they try and cram more people into an already overcrowded park that is incapable of holding the people that it already has in it let alone the 1000 people there then letting every hour later. Its no fun for anyone standing tightly packed in a que with people that have been sweating all day and may not be aware that there personal hygiene leaves a little to be desired let alone the health and safety implications of cramming so many people into a dimly lit park full of animals and with staff that appear to be unaware of whats going on run by a camp Basil Fawlty, the place is just a recipe for disaster and all the staff seem to want to do is create as much chaos and havoc as possible to keep you busy and to stop you joining an already very long que. We asked for directions to the show and we were sent to the exit, the lady there sent us back to where we had just come from ???? to another guy who again tried to send us to the exit. So to try and get something out of the evening we joined the very long que for the trams where they try and force you to have your photo taken and when you finally get on the tram its then held up whilst they try and take another photo ??? (Hello !!!! look at the que ???)One of the most blatant cash grabs ive ever seen (i felt embarrassed for them). We did enjoy the tram ride but after it was over we had had enough so this time they showed us the exit we too it, gave up on trying to see the show and joined the melee outside which resembled euro 2016 in an effort to secure a taxi which was just as disorganised and chaotic as it was inside the park. But to end on a positive note the highlight of the evening was the fire dancers ! which turned out to be 2 women twirling glow sticks !!!???!!! it was that pathetic and poorly done it was actually hilarious it did make us laugh in what was otherwise a dismal night. So in the spirit of the evening you can shove your night Safari where the sun doesn't shine !!!! (cheesy pun intended)"
,,A nice surprise,5.0,,"I usually avoid zoos because I feel sorry for the animals, but the night Safari in Singapore Zoo is an amazing experience. The zoo is open and except for the cases of very aggressive animals such as tigers and leopards you can see no cages. They have a beautiful space and several kinds of animals. It is still a zoo, I know, but one that is worth visiting. After the Safari on the car you can walk through the several trails and enjoy Singapore warm nights visiting the animals. Its worthy arriving around 7m and start the walk trails and get the cars around 10pm as there will be no line. Very organised and easy to go back to town."
,,It was good experience,5.0,,"It was good experience, tram ride with open vagons, one can see all the animals in their natural habitats, this needs advance planning, good for kids"
,,I would recommend against it,2.0,,"Not something of a must do I must say. It was very disappointing after having my hopes set high that it was something not to miss. There were rats crawling all over the place, and there wasn't much to see which didn't justify the entry fee."
,,Overhyped,3.0,,Nothing fantastic and truly more hype than anything. I was thoroughly disappointed during my visit. The night safari was also crawling with rats.
,,Epic!,5.0,,"Wow!! One of the best things IMO to do in Singapore. Starts at 7pm. Take a ride safari ride at night through lots of different animal enclosures! Really really great thing to do, we loved it!! Must must do attraction - we got a ticket for $70 which included the zoo, river safari and bird pack)"
,,Rubbish,1.0,,"This came highly recommended but it was absolute tosh. It's like walking into a funfair at the start with noisy food and retail outlets. The public are not discouraged from making a noise and ppl just walk along the trails talking, laughing and shouting, so no surprise the animals aren't going to behave as naturally as they can. The only ones that seemed unaffected were the fishing cats. On the tram, the seats are too low to see the animals on both sides. Has the potential to be a good attraction but commercial greed seems to have ruined the product."
,,Night safari,3.0,,The night safari was okay but not that exciting; most of the animals are sleeping or it's too dark to see them properly.
,,Spring vacation in Singapore,5.0,,"Night safari was spectacular weird cause i felt what you can see at night, to my surprise was the opposite. I recommend all family's with kids to take this opportunity to experience wild live animals at night, and live show just before you enter the tour."
,,Our night at the zoo,3.0,,"Located next door to the river safari and Singapore zoo, this is a must see when you visit Singapore. I give it an average rating not because it wasn't fun just because I thought it could of been a bit better. The shows were interactive and entertaining. The tram takes you around and you can get on and off when you choose. I feel that to see everything in a not so rushed matter is hard we arrived at 7:15 and left around 11:30pm as the Mosquitos where eating me alive despite the patches I was wearing. There are afew choices for food, we ate at Bongo Burgers it was ok $$$. Lots of walking so wear good shoes. All in all a fun night my son really enjoyed."
,,Plan the evening before,4.0,,"Suggested Itinerary: There is a show at the entrance at 630 so be on time. 730 you can watch the creatures of the night show which is close to the entrance. After the show take a tram ride which is around half an hour but the queue of the tram is long (could be an hour as well). After the tram ride you can take one of the walking trails. The trails take you closer to the animals.
Make sure you are in the correct tram queue with English instructions as you pass by. There one queue for Chinese announcement as well."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,This is one of the best experiences we had in Singapore. You might have visited a zoo in the day time but this gives you an idea of what animals does in the night. I pity on these animals as they are not allowed to sleep till the safari ends by 12 midnight. We thoroughly enjoyed our walk in the night visiting various animals.
,,A truly different way to visit a zooe,5.0,,My wife and i visited the night zoo on our last visit to Singapore and were able to see those nocturnal animals up close and active. There was just enough light so that we and came away with some great photos of the visit. Highly recommend teh Night Safari to anyone visiting Singapore.
,,Great,5.0,,Great place to visit and enjoy the tram ride at the darkness. Worth to visit. Exciting and interesting
,,Creatures of the night show,3.0,,"Visited on 16/11/16 with friend. Watched the 7:30pm show. Is interesting,fun and educating. The show presenter is language talented as she greet n passed the important message to us in Japanese,Korean,Mandarin,Tamil of do not use flash when taking photos."
,,ammazing different experience,5.0,,it was an amazing experience and a different one. you get on a train which takes you around the zoo to see the animals nightlife and its total safe and recommended.
,,A different experience,5.0,,The night we went was very busy . We spent over an in a queue but it was well worth the wait . A very different way to see the animals. Can recommend
,,Simply a different experience,5.0,,"This is a different experience
Usually zoo and safari is day type events
But here it's night fun
You go around by a safe train
And what you see is all the wild animals moving openly and you can take pictures make movies
And there is enough light to see everything and to capture in your cameras
At least for one time you must visit"
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,Overall Experience is very nice. Very Well mentioned the whole area. Amazing Night Safari Trail. So Much Greenery .
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"Had heard lots of rave reviews about the Night Zoo so decided to check it out. Had done the other two zoo areas during the day and came back for this at night. Had bought a ticket in advance and it has a set time and day that you have to be there. Arrived back at the zoo at 7pm for the ticketed time of 7-15 and the lines were huge - did not actually get into the zoo until about 7-45pm. Almost walked off at one stage as wondered if it was worth the wait.
Once inside, decided to walk around rather than take the free train, which everyone else seemed to be lining up for. Felt like I was almost there on my own at some stages. Nice to see the animals at night with the soft lights.
You can walk around most of the zoo and see all the animals better than you can from the train, so would recommend that, but there are some parts that you can only see from the free train. Be aware the train very packed at the start of the night but less crowded as the night progresses.
Overall, am glad that I have seen it but probably would not go again. Saw most of the animals in the day zoo so nothing new at the night zoo, but was cooler and some animals a bit more active in the cool. Take insect repellent and be prepared for long a long wait to get in."
,,Fun family experience,5.0,,"Definitely something worth seeing especially if you have kids with you. They will get to see so many different and sometimes exotic animals in their ""natural"" habitat. It was a fun experience."
,,Nice but small,4.0,,Safari is good to visit if you did not visit the zoo in morning. Tram ride was nice and could see quite a few animals. the walking tours are good and you can spot animals with some effort. overall a good place to visit with children.
,,Great evening out,5.0,,Visiting the Zoo at night gives a totally different perspective to animal behaviour & habitat. It's much cooler and easier to walk around at night. Low lighting means you can see the animals. Get there early so you don't miss the fire show.
,,Insane queues!,2.0,,"Trust me when I say do not visit on the weekend. I visited the night safari and pre-booked my tickets for the 8pm slot to enter on a Saturday night. When I got to night safari at 7.45pm, I had to join an insanely long queue despite my pre-booking and only entered the place at around 10pm. When you are in, don't bother taking the tram from the first stop as the queue is just as insane. Take a short walk to the second station and thn catch the tram from there to bring you around the whole Safari. That tram ride though was enjoyable."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"A tram drives you though the animal habitats at night so you can observe their nocturnal behaviors. However, the tram is rather fast and i'm sure the animals are hip to the game... Go anyway if you're interested in it. It's still worth checking out."
,,Fun Facts,4.0,,"I really liked the night safari. I found the shows entertaining and the tour full of interesting facts. I liked the fact that you can hop on and off ""trains"" at a designated stop, take walking routes and speak friendly staff along the way. I found my visit educational and fun."
,,Most of the animals are asleep,3.0,,"The tour is educational and we also saw animals that we can almost touch. Most of them are asleep or hiding, I think that kind of tour can be enjoyed by kids. It is also heartwarming to know that they keep endangered animals."
,,singapore zoo,5.0,,"must visit place in singapore. kids and adults equally enjoy this thoroughly. divided into two...zoo ....river safari and night safari..its an awesome place . totally loved it. beautifully made, awesome fauna...specially loved jia jia and kai kai and the polar bear.. night safari is an...More"
,,Interesting but limited.,3.0,,"This place is really cool in theory. Animals active at night in their natural habitat. But it turns out that it looks a lot like most zoos except it is darker and harder to identify or even see the animals properly. That said, it was...More"
,,Not as good as Dubbo,3.0,,We were a little disappointed with the Night Safari. The show we saw (there is only 1) was quite bad. There are about 100+ people watching it but the hosts only speak to one section of the audience. The rest were left in the dark...More
,,Not worth the visit.,3.0,,"If you are thinking of visiting, think twice. The fire throwing entrance show is ok. The night creatures are mediocre. The train ride is too fast when passing the animals which you cant use flash hence cant take photos. Most animals are sleeping and resting....More"
,,Good for one time,3.0,,The tram ride experience is gud. It takes you through whole park showing animals with audio commentary. Walking in night in the park is not gud idea hence tram ride is better to take. Park has gud collection of animals. The staff was helpful and...More
,,The animals are so active,5.0,,"It is located next to the Malaysian border, so a 50 minute drive away from town. Forget public transport here, the cab fare is worth the time saved. The animals are so active that it's as though their feeding time is synchronised with the opening...More"
,,"Quiet, calm and interesting experience with lots of animals.",4.0,,"The night tram is the highlight of the trip, recommend not taking the first few trams because there will be many families and kids, it becomes difficult to hear the commentary and reduces the whole experience of looking at the animals peacefully. From 9.30 onwards,...More"
,,Family trip,3.0,,"A great zoo, we unfortunately went on a night the animals weren't very active. If possible avoid weekends as it is extremely busy. The fishing cats were our highlight!"
,,Interesting to see the zoo's nightlife,3.0,,Very popular especially early in the evening. Long lines at that time (up to 9-9:30PM) Lines get much shorter after this. Plan to take the tram and 1 or 2 walks. Especially enjoyed seeing the bats.
,,Fantastic - for all of us!,5.0,,"We all loved the place. Be patient and come early - there are too many tourists - and pre-order tickets. But once you have managed to come on the safaribus, you can relax. Also you can explore the animals on your own which is the most interesting part."
,,No go,2.0,,"Disappointed of this tourist attraction.
I didn't appreciate the industrial way this night zoo is working. They put you in an open kind of bus and drive you around the zoo by night. It basically smelled gas during the whole thing and I haven't seen anything except animals struggling to get some sleep under flash lights."
,,Great fun sneaking around at night!,4.0,,"Having spent the day at the zoo and river safari i thought i might be a bit animal-d out by the time of the night safari. How wrong I was! We bought tickets online for 62dollars which gave entrance to the 4 parks (bird park too). We picked the earliest entrance to the night zoo which was 7.15 so that we had the longest time there. I would recommend this as you really do need the time if you want to do and see everything properly.
The q at the start to get on a tram was long but not unbearable. There's always the option to do the walking tours first and then the tram anyway.
We did tram first which drove us all round the park and had an informative audio guide. Obviously the animals are not all going to be standing there waiting for us to spot them but that said I think we saw most of them in some way or another.
After the tram we went to the creatures of the night show. It was a bit of fun but I don't really agree with using animals for performances. After this we saw the fire show. I was expecting a group of people but it was just one man. That said, he was amazing and had us all squirming as he got a bit too close to the flames!
After the shows we spent the rest of our night walking round the 4 walking trails and trying to spot all the animals.
One thing that could be improved, i know the point in that it's a night zoo and should be dark but some enclosures were so dark could see nothing through the windows at all not even a branch! And also some of the lighting was too dim to read the information provided about the animal.
Great way to end the day, was such a different experience and felt so special being able to wander around at night by ourselves."
,,Entertaining visit,4.0,,"We booked through Viator - ""skip the line priority tram boarding with buffet dinner incl""( tour run by Tour East) picked up at exact time and our guide Christopher was wonderful! Group of 14, we went straight in to dinner and had the room to ourselves! Buffet food was great, loads of choices and all clean and hygienic. Even dessert was lovely. Then off to the tram, avoid the queue and right on board. Interesting commentary as you pass each animal, some hard to see in the dim light but they are very strict on no flash specifically to keep the animals safe. After tram ride went for walk to see some up close then went to night creatures show which was very cute. Bus took us straight back to our hotels . Highly recommend"
,,Excellent experience,3.0,,"Excellent place you must visit with family especially night safari, worth taking tram tour and watch animals from close distance."
,,What's not to love?,5.0,,"A walk in the dark through winding path, finding most animals super awake and prowling their territory... the night safari has always been sort of an oasis in Singapore, a place where I would go almost every two months to just unwind when I was younger. Now that I am a mother with two kids, I bring them here often and they love it too!"
,,Great place to visit.,5.0,,"Although being from Guwahati, Assam,India where there is a beautiful zoo along with a botanical garden but this was a different experience. Animals in the night environment wow it is great. Nicely managed zoo. My young daughters enjoyed a lot during the tour. Must see in Singapore."
,,One of the best things I have done,5.0,,"This was fun! My daughter and I just did this attraction last night and we had a blast. If you can get past the heat, the tram ride is amazing, the trails afterwards were long, but definitely worth it. Food was great! I would recommend this to anyone, especially someone with kids"
,,Night Safari does not mean nothing can be seen,4.0,,"Best is to be there on time, the moment the Night Safari opens, then you can catch the special performances just right after entry.

Then take the tram first followed by a slow walk through the park.

Walk through the bat enclosure is a must.

Bring your own water if you want to save on costs, have a filling dinner first.

Get some special souvenirs but they can be pricey.

Be prepared to spend the night there till around 11++."
,,Worth the queue,5.0,,"Trundling through the dark jungle looking at animals that were just simply being themselves, and getting close enough to a Tapir to go cross-eyed trying to look at all of the animal at the same time, was simply brilliant"
,,Overrated and Disappointing,3.0,,"We went to the Singapore Zoo, both during the day and also to the night sessions.

The night safari was substandard, as there are a much larger range of attractions and animals to see during the day.

With huge lines and long wait times of over an hour for a tram ride with a few stops, was disappointing.

Even with the poor lighting, many of the animals were not even there and the ones that were, meant they were barely visible.

So much for the wild animal encounters as advertised.

Afterwards, the included 20 minute, creatures of the night performance, showcased a few animals briefly, but also has limited seating and is based on a first come, first serve basis.

On a positive note the fire breathing and juggling show was very entertaining.
The marketing for this attraction is overrated, as is basically the whole experience."
,,Excellent experience for first-timers and young,5.0,,Unique night bus-ride. Walking trails are a hit. Can be done in about 2.5hrs and still spare time for dinner at a restaurant.
,,Its not just a safari. I would recommend going in early,3.0,,"The night safari ride is about 1 hour long. However, if you go in early, you could do a lot of walking trails along the tram's path. We saw 1 show named 'creatures of the night'. It was a 20 minute show where the trainers showcased nocturnal animals. Its fun for kids, not really much for adults to do, unless you are a nature buff."
,,Night Safari Trip,2.0,,"I was highly recommended to go on this trip. We booked it through the hotel and had arranged to be picked up at 6pm for a 7pm entry and 10pm arrival back to the hotel. We didn't arrive till 7:30, we missed the first animal show and so we went in the tram around the Safari instead. I found it very boring and was disappointed that in most pens the were only one animal in them. They looked so sad and lonely and very bored. I didn't enjoy it at all. I wouldn't recommend it much at all. The only thing I did enjoy were the fire breathing/juggling men. That was entertaining for 10 mins. It took so long to drop off all the other people of at their hotels first, we didn't get back to our hotel until nearly 11pm. I had a very tired 9 year old."
,,Night safari,5.0,,Night safari was great though it was sometimes hard to spot species. Recommend for anyone who is interested in night animals!
,,Average,3.0,,"We visited this place because many travel guides mentioned it as a must-go spot in Singapore. Better to arrive a few minutes before the open time, the queue is always quite long. There are many food places to eat before entering, convenient but pricey. It is a special experience to watch a zoo at night, but if you want to see the animals properly, choose daytime. Flash photography is not allowed."
,,Classic tour,5.0,,Great night highly informed guide Nur. Completely different zoo from day zoo completely different experience. Loved it
,,Disappointing,2.0,,They only had buffaloes. .cows...elephant. .deers etc..to show.. Highly disappointing visit and lots of waiting time.. The live show is very pedestrian with nothing gr8 to offer.. Avoid to visit
,,Poor organization and management.,2.0,,"I understand this attraction used to be a national icon.The place I saw, however, was poorly organised and managed - poor crowd control, poor manners (of the staff), unhappy and lifeless animals. I recall that it has seen better days under a different management."
,,Revisited and Still Fun,5.0,,Our group loved the fire dance and the creatures of the night show. We completely enjoyed the tram ride through the night safari and the walk as well. This has always been one of our favourite tourist destinations to recommend to our overseas guests and it still is.
,,Revisited the great experience,5.0,,"Revisited on 1st Nov'16
Time : 7.00pm

this experience included the animal show, Tram ride and the fire show.
all the three experience was good and satisfactory.

the professional way these shows and tours are conducted are commendable.

Night Safari proves that wildlife at night is even more exciting and adventurous.

Must have experience if you are visiting Singapore"
,,nearly 4 hours and hard earned money wasted,1.0,,"It was a terrible experience.After completing visit of Bird park which was almost worth visiting we took rest and waited for the ticket counter to open at 5.30pm.Tickets were issued shortly and the Q opened very late.By this time shops and hangouts were opened.We were asked to wait for the fire show first.The long waited show was nothing but below average performance by locals which we see street performers doing better in India.It was only curtain raiser of another be-fooling show to follow.It was named as live performance by animals.The show was not worth commenting.We rushed for the tram ride which was still disappointing.Some animals were seen here and there during the 40 minutes long ride.Food courts were doing brisk business.For heavens sake avoid night safari which does not match the standards of Singapore,save money,time and energy.No element of cheating can be seen in Singapore other than here."
,,Dinner on the Safari,4.0,,"My latest trip to the Singapore Zoo was an interesting one. Part of a business trip, dinner was to be part of a tour of the Night Safari. Singapore's Night Safari is part of the zoo that opens only at night and featuring nocturnal animals.
Arriving at the zoo, we were ushered into a special waiting area where part rangers introduced us up close and personal to some friendly animals over welcome drinks and canapés.
Next, a specially modified tram that has been transformed into a moving restaurant arrived and my group was ushered on board. Appetizer was served together with your choice of cocktails or wines. While enjoying the starters, we pass through animal exhibits with a ranger narrating through what we are seeing.
For the mains, we stop at a dining station where we were served by a team of chefs. The food was surprisingly good for such a novelty experience. I would suggest that this equals some of the better restaurants I have been to in terms of how delicious the servings was. My menu was pre-selected so I'm not certain if there was any ala carte options. Considering this is a special offering for groups, I hazard a guess that the food has to be pre-determined ahead of time.
Our tram continued on our journey over dessert, ending the night with wine, good company and a parting gift of a zebra from the zoo. That's a nice touch."
,,A nice experience,4.0,,"The night safari simulates a feel of visiting the jungle in the night. There will be quiet a queue to enter the premise, so better be well ahead of the prescribed time. If you are planning to visit river safari and zoo then would recommend to take the 4-park hopper ticket."
,,Good,4.0,,"Good experience. But small kids can get a bit scared. My 3 yr old got scared of the fire show by the natives.
Most animals were Indian or the ones u find at the Indian safaris. But nevertheless. The view and proximity to the Animals is good. Ride is comfortable.
Only issue to get in we had to wait almost an hour. And with small children it can b an issue at times. Specially coz we had done the zoo also on the same day.
We didn't do the creatures of they night show. And we didn't get off the team to explore. But there were ppl doing that. But very few.
All in all a good experience."
,,Much better at day,2.0,,"Basically I would not recommend the night safari unless there are specific nocturnal animals you wish to see. We went to the Zoo on both day and night sessions and the daytime is miles better in my opinion - a much, much larger range of attractions and animals during the day."
,,Wonderful,1.0,,"It's a wonderful experience watching the animals at night and yeah they are not sleeping : ). It was so much fun and informative as well. The only downside was that the queue was very long.
You will just take the open air bus tour for 40mins and then watch the show and that's it. Very crowded though."
,,"Night tram ride is nice, but be prepared to queue for at least 1 hour",3.0,,"One of three zoos within walking distance of each other (main, river, night). This night zoo contains several species that are nocturnal. As a result, you get to see them awake and moving compared to their buddied in the main zoo. Before entering, there are several food places to eat at, but quite pricey. Especially on a Saturday night. be prepared to queue for at least 1 hour before being able to enter the gates of the zoo, and another hour before getting on to the tram. If you take kids, make sure they don't get tired early. Lighting not that great, so hard to take any decent photos. Overall, a must see, but probably only once."
,,Going down,2.0,,"We had the chance to discover the night safari 5 years ago. It was expensive but pretty good. Now it's more expensive and the train is going faster so that it's difficult to see animals properly. Sounds like they are trying to make more money in less time. So, if you really wanna see something, either do it om foot, either go to the tamman negara in Malaysia."
,,kids..,4.0,,"If you have kids, the night tour is definately worth it. Different to what they are used to and a lot of fun. A tip though, the food and drinks are obscenely expensive...bring your own...and try bring insect repellent"
,,Tom much party... not enough zoo,2.0,,"Staff were awesome and polite but the park seemed so built towards being a late night party stop rather then a zoo.It was seriously overpriced.

The safari ride for me was sadly disappointing. The darkness and poor lighting meant that a lot of animal details in the safari talk were not visible and in some cases the animals themselves were just moving bulges in the dark. Closer inspection of most of these enclosures in what lighting was available revealed poor enclosure design and the large male bull elephant on the ride was repetitively rocking back and forth which was extremely concerning as Ive never seen this at ANY other park.

Alot of the enclosures along the walking paths were not well lit and quite simply If you inspect them closely they are extremely average which is masked by the darkness.

The shear variety of hoof stock species here was impressive and the some of the species kept here were awesome ( Malayan tiger, Sloth bear, Asiatic lion) But again what is the point if you cant really even see them !!!

The lines here were long for everything and the crowd seemed more interested in partying then enjoying the animals.

The staff here were EXTREMELY GOOD and I can honestly say that of all the parks in Singapore they were the most friendly here."
,,Don't take young children!,3.0,,"We went on the eve of a long weekend along with thousands of other people. With a 6 year old and a 2 year old. Both were asleep in the bus which took 45 minutes to get there from the CBD. Lots of walking. Don't eat there - fish and chips, a cheese burger and 2drinks cost $50. Night tram was good, had to leave the tour early and get a taxi back."
,,Sadly Disappointing tired and expensive!,3.0,,"It has been about ten years since I've been back on the night safari. The tram pride was tired, the vocals were inaudible. The animals weren't all that abundant. So not really worth over sixty dollars!"
,,Fab! Kids loved it,5.0,,"We can walk as well as the tram, we went in tram 1st and did the lap, then walked around. We can see all the animals, kids loved it. Take good walking shoes, a lot of walking required."
,,Dnt come after the rain,3.0,,Dnt come after the rain cz the animals are not there. Very nice place to bond. The staff are good and very polite
,,david,1.0,,This trip takes min. 1 houre by bus to the goal then 40 min for 45 dollar for to see 20 diifferent kindes of gosts and dears with luck some lions..singapore is a nice place but this safari its like a bad joke
,,It was okay...,3.0,,"I really love animals so i could not really say that night safari was bad, but it was not as good as the River Safari or Singapore Zoo. Most of the animals featured on the tram tour were goats of different kinds, but there were also boars, lions, beasts, etc. Unfortunately, some of the ""nocturnal"" animals were sleeping during the tour. They also have an animal show that featured a few nocturnal animals doing tricks. It was awesome and eductional especially for kids."
,,Absolute highlight,5.0,,"Avoid weekends and local holidays to avoid the crowds. Go a little later as well as most people arrive for opening time and leave early, you should then stay later. It gets very busy early on. Take a tram ride first - a bit little like disney world and then walk around at your leisure. If you can get some space to yourself, not easy, (but just remain until the others move off) then you can get a great experience of animals that are usually asleep during the day. Some of the animals can be very close , especially the tigers. We found it a great experience. We were totally captivated by the fishing leopard. Please note it is not part of the zoo but a separate entity. We would rate this as one the best things to do in Singapore."
,,Linda Chan best tour guide,4.0,,Linda Chan led our tour. She was awesome! We skipped the animal show at the end to walk around on the trails and watch the tiger get fed.
,,See and hear the animals when they are most active,5.0,,"The Night Safari at SIngapore Zoo is an absolute must visit. We have been there several times and the visit never fails to excite us; travelling around the zoo in the tram, one feels up close and personal with the so much alive nocturnal residents"
,,Children will love this,5.0,,"We travelled to the zoo by train and bus which was an interesting journey through the suburbs, but long. The express bus service was a good choice to go back on. The queues are long to catch the tram ride through the park but it moves quickly.
We really enjoyed walking the Leopard Trail after the ride by taking the tram back to the first stop and then walking back along the trails to the centre."
,,So much fun,4.0,,Loved doing this. It was such a different experience going through the park at night being soo close to some of the more friendly animals that are more free range. I would defiantly recommend making time to do this safari.
,,great fun,4.0,,had great fun watching all the animals in the night safari in Singapore. very well organised and friendly staff.
,,Avoid if you can.,1.0,,"The animal show is such a mess, hoards of tourists crammed up together like school kids, shows are not even educational or fun, something you can do better on your own walking trails. Its too little animals involved and too much talking. Got cramped up on a hot evening and totally not worth the troubles.

The tram ride was another disaster, was allocated in the tram quene so that my family could sit together in one, yet the tram didn't stop in accordance to how we were allocated by the staff and I couldn't sit together with my family.

Night safari is really getting from bad to worse, even Bongo Burgers allows everyone to cut quene with no fans and nothing, even for dining guests.

Will never return again, its so boring even the kids complain about going home, such a pity to see Night Safari's renowned reputation for animal conservation falling prey to economic attraction..."
,,Ok but...,3.0,,"It's a great venue and great to see some animals at night, but long wait to get onto trams and overall an expensive night for what you get and it's a little out of town. My daughter enjoyed it but didn't love it!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Professionally conducted by friendly staff thoughout. Many different animals are to be seen from the comfortable articulated bus. The voice over can be a bit intrusive and over enthusiastic but on the whole excellent.
A Burger was over 12SGD, a beer 13.5SGD so not what you would call a cheap spot for a feed."
,,A must do in Singapore,4.0,,"We did a tour which included coach to the Safari and a buffet dinner. Tour guide gave us lots of information on the way and was very entertaining.
Dinner was all Asian dishes but a reasonable variety. If you buy food at one of the outlets its quite expensive ( $10 for a hotdog)
The advantage of a tour visit is that you don't have to join a long line to get on the tram to tour the zoo. It was really great seeing the animals at night and you get a great view from the tram.
Make sure you go to the show as well as it was very entertaining for the whole family."
,,Really worth doing,5.0,,"We arrived in a middle of a very heavy storm, and had thought that it might not be an ideal time to visit. How wrong we were! Once the storm had passed all the animals were out and about. We decided to do the walking trails first, which was a good plan because everyone else lined up for the tram. By the time we got back from the walk, we had the tram almost to ourselves! All of the animals were on the move - we saw the lion stretch and roar, hippos wallowing, fishing cat fishing, leopards pacing and a tiger bare his teeth. Possibly better than Singapore Zoo, when I visited a few year ago."
,,Checked out the changes at Night Safari,5.0,,"A cool night to be out in the rainforest.
It was crowded being a public holiday on 29th October.
The new time slots to book are a good idea..however the Members line was not as organized and there were a lot of Members with kids cutting the queue.
The tram ride was great and is still the best way to view the animals at Night Safari. I especially loved the Malayan Tigers so beautiful in the night.
Night Safari should be enjoyed with no camera's. The stubborn tourist who still keeping using flash for taking photos are countless reminders should be banned from being allowed on the tram ride.
The recorded commentary has been updated which was really in good timing with the ride.
We signed up for the annual 4 parks membership as we really like how the 4 parks are maintained and is always such an adventure to visit."
,,Big disappointment,2.0,,"We were so excited to do this trip after reading many reviews but were quite disappointed and feel as an arranged excursion costing 250 Singapore dollars for four persons, very poor value for money for just 2.5 hours in the park The tour East trip was rushed from the start; pick up at hotel at 6pm, supposed to be at the zoo by 6.30pm but city traffic go there at 7.15pm, too late to see the first show. The tram had 20 minute queue, heaving with noisy camera/flash clicking tourists, with no regard for the welfare of the animals. The grounds are lovely and sympadtic for the animal's natural surroundings as can be in a zoo. My advice is if you want to see animals at night go under your own steam so you can do this in a less rushed manner but be warned huge crowds, worse than Alton Tiwers and £80 for three low grade burger and chips!"
,,loved it,5.0,,great concept and wonderful experience. it is quite incredible to see the animals after dark. i would recommend to anyone when in Singapore. You basically hop onto the tram and it takes you around - there are some additional paths to follow on foot
,,Great guided tour on the tram,5.0,,Great guided tour on the tram. Was there for a business event. Staff were great and helpful. Took time to explain to us throughout the ride. Great variety of eateries around.
,,ok for kids,3.0,,"the night safari is ok , its good to go if you have kids, try to go when there is no rain as that somewhat hampers the experience , the number and variety of animals are limited"
,,We Went on the Night Safari and the boat trip....,4.0,,"We visited specifically to do the World Famous Night Safari and we were not disappointed!! The whole ride was very well organised with real close up views of a big variety of animals. Very cleverly done!! Good commentary lots of information and well worth the trip. the boat trip however was underwhelming, we walked down to the boat pier taking in all the animal exhibits along the way, including lots of interesting fishes to look at! we arrived at the boat we were loaded on and did a circuit of the top end of a lake, not a word of commentary, no idea what we might (or might not) see. In the end we didn't see anything , which would not have been a problem had they actually explained what was going on!! I think the driver spent a liottle too much time on his smart phone!!"
,,Not Worthy,3.0,,"Most disappointed place, not worthy, though you can find few animals, the journey is not excited. a simple attraction"
,,A great experience,5.0,,This is a must see attraction. When we first got there the queues were (seemed) very long but the efficiency by which people are processed onto the 'tram' meant that the wait was less than 30 minutes. To see the animals by night will live long in the memory.
,,Interesting and unique,3.0,,"I liked the Night Safari, but wouldn't go out of my way to go back. The set up is very well done, the concept brilliant. Very busy, so when you begin skip the tram and start walking. Paths were deserted when I started out, which was fun and a bit scary (in a good way). It is very dark, so you can't be in a rush. You have to be patient and look around-- a bit like finding a needle in a haystack sometimes because the animals are hiding. Nonetheless fun. At the conclusion of walking the entire park I took the tram, which was rewarding as you saw the big animals most come for. I can't help but think I should have just gone to the Zoo for the day to see the animals better."
,,Night Zoo is cool,4.0,,"A short trip from town to the Singapore Zoo's Night Safari is well worth the trip. If in a group, would highly recommend taking a taxi, as it will be comparative cost to MRT tickets, but much faster.
You should also book your tickets online as they allot entry times to a limited number of guests, starting at 7:15pm and allotting entry hourly after then. You will need to line up to enter, and there is always lots of people and tour groups this early.
The eateries there have a generous selection of meals without being to over the top in price.
Pro tip: Don't go on the trams first - everyone else is going to do that. Do the walking portion first, then go on the Tram."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore especially if you are accompanied by kids. Live show is a good way of learning
,,An evening to remember,5.0,,Singapore night safari is an attraction not to be missed. A huge crowd is always peresent there to feel the experience. The experience starts with a fire show followed by a wild life animal show. Thereafter you are taken by a tram to experience the night safari. Animals are seen like in moonlight. It is an unforgettable experience.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This night safari was awesome ,first time doing it so I can't compare it to any other ones . But I thoroughly enjoyed it , they had an animal show which was good . And a tram ride that went around the whole park, went for a good half an hour . You could also do trail walks that took you closer to the animals . They had other entertainment too while everyone was waiting . Would definitely recommend this to everyone !!"
,,Night life with a twist!,5.0,,Imagine you walking and 3 hyena gazing at you quietly! chills right? This is place for you if you like adventure and wildlife! there are minimum lights but enough to give you directions and path lights help you walk! There are daily shows which you enjoy which are amazing! There are zoo officials after every 50 mt so you can never get lost! its totally safe!
,,Overpriced,3.0,,"We were very disappointed by this attraction and found it to be overpriced and very crowded. It was well organised, but the tram around the park goes very quickly, so fast that you cannot take photos (no flashes allowed, which is fair to the animals). We enjoyed the walks more than the tram. There were not that many animals. Food choices were limited. Good souvenir shops."
,,night zoo visit,3.0,,we visited the zoo during night as u have the choice of time visit as it open both day and night. good experience for us to visit zoo in the dark
,,Relaxing!,5.0,,"My partner and I attended the night Safari and it was nothing short of amazing. Even though the sun goes down quickly this was well worth it. The pre show with the fire performers was great. It gets very busy though so I do recommend getting there early. Like an hour or more early. The tram ride was excellent, took you around the park to various exhibits and the tour was well guided by an automated voice which was great. A lot of exhibits had lights so you could see the animals if they were awake. It was also just very relaxing to sit back enjoy the ride and listen to the sounds of the rainforest around us when there was no one talking. There was also a show called creatures of the night or something along those lines and it was great. Animals coming from all directions and the presenters were well spoken and interacted with the crowd which was fantastic. Outstanding night, would definitely go again."
,,Family attraction,4.0,,Good attraction for families. Avoid dinner at Night Safari as you can eat better elsewhere with less price.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Very hard to see the animals and very quick to drive past on the train. Tea was very expensive and not enough time between shows, you had to pick the fire show or tea.then it was straight to the night animal show, we had five minutes after the show to get back on the bus, to be taken back to our motel."
,,"Walk the trail, see the show, take the tram.",5.0,,"I have been to the night safari several times and it has always been my go to place to bring visitors to. The Night Safari is one of the best (if not, the best) attraction in Singapore and is certainly one of a kind.

Located in the North of Singapore you can take a taxi there or a bus. If driving parking is really easy.

If you read some of the reviews, there was points deducted for poor food or crowds. Well it is the zoo, don't go there for food unless you really have very little time. And being the best attraction in Singapore and one of the very few things you can do at night of course it would be crowded.

How to Enjoy The Park

For me there is only one way to go about enjoying the night safari which is to go right when the park opens, and once you enter, avoid the tram queue and avoid the show. Go straight to the walking trail. This would allow you to enjoy the environment, be relatively away from the noise and get to see the animals up close without the pressure of being pushed forward. The trail would take u an hour or more and you should take your time. This will bring you to a sort of pit stop with a tram stop. Do not take the tram here. Do go to the tram stop and walk on as it has a small path beyond it to bring you to the giraffes. Many people don't notice that. The other thing to note at the pit stop is to find the lion look out.

Continue walking from the pit stop on the next trail and you will see lots of stuff. Eventually you will return to the main entrance. It is one big loop and its a good 1-2 hrs walk. Take your time enjoy it. Now at the main entrance you can go to see the show. The idea is to take the tram ride as late as possible. That is where the queues are the shortest and sometimes u get to choose where to sit on the tram.

I usually leave at closing time. But I have time for everything and if really want, i can go on the tram more than once.

So walk the trail, see the show, take the tram.

The night safari is a place where you can escape from the city and to enjoy time with animals and the environment. You can bring your own food and drink if you must. Naturally like all attractions, try to go on a week day."
,,Again,4.0,,Not allot to do all around in wonderful safe Singapore so I would highly recommend this and you can get great chinese food
,,Give it a go,5.0,,"This was the first night safari I had been on. Was a good experience. The animals seemed to have enough space around them.

The train takes you around the park, allowing you to view the animals quite close up. The variety of animals is good, including tigers, elephants and lions."
,,Nice plan but forget pictures,4.0,,"The plan is good if you want to see animals up-close, however flash photo is not allowed, so you better enjoy watching the animals in their environment. Shops and food expensive. Animal shows can be cancelled. Good for families."
,,Worthwhile adventurous visit!,4.0,,"Experience: Two ways to view the animals: by tram, by foot. Recommend you take the tram and there is a tram stop for you to get off and walk, but don't get off just ride thru the entire tram experience (40 minutes) as there are some animals you can only view on the tram. After the tram ride, take the trails they are all connected so start from one side and be sure to bring a map to maneuver thru the bushes/trees and finish at the end of the other trails.

Animals: A whole variety of interesting creatures to view during the night. I saw animals and their habits that I have never seen before. Truly worthwhile nocturnal experience to see animals that usually would not be visible during the day!

Location: Centre of Singapore, north of the Singapore Botanical Gardens and Central Business District and Orchard Shopping district. Taxi recommended.

Key Takeaway: If you don't mind going slightly away from common Singapore landmarks, this is a recommended visit as the experience is like no other. Recommend going during low-peak periods or later in the evening to avoid crowds or queues."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"We had heard a lot of Hype about how good the Night Safari was and I have to say we were very disappointed. There were long queues to get in and we got on the Safari Train and we saw the usual animals, elephant, lion, hippo etc. (all a long distance from the safari train and poorly lit so very difficult to see them. The train also did not actually slow down or stop in order for you to take any photos. The food area was very clean and nicely laid out, but was very expensive as were the gift shops. The walking trails again, were just ok, and coming from Australia .. we saw lots of possums and wallabies .. interesting for those who are not Australian I guess ! The live show was fun and the host was entertaining. Overall, I would not recommend this activity .. unless you have never been to a zoo before."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"The actual tram ride and sight of animals was cool. Fire show was less than 10 minutes. Creature show was downplayed by our tour guide and food not good. Animals were cool! Tigers, lions, bears, giraffe, Zebra and loads of deer among other things."
,,Loads of queues but well worth it,4.0,,Saw everything we came for. Well organised but lots of queues for the night trams around the forest. Food plenty of outlets good parking and loads of taxis well described too. Didn't like the fire eaters much as I kept thinking about them having hiccups which might well have killed them as they kept taking flammable liquid into mouth before blowing it out for effect
,,Loved it,4.0,,The flying squirrels didn't show themselves but other than that it was a magical experience. Well maintained park. Animals were a bit stressed (an elephant was shifting its weight left and right and a porcupine was circling endlessly).
,,I'm not sure it's worthwhile...,3.0,,"I was very excited to do this, and it turned out to be a let down.
Some pictures showed you could go in an enclosed vehicle and the large cats would come around the vehicle, but that was not what happened. You can walk thru the paths or take the train, but you really have to strain to see the animals because it's so dark."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,This was a good experience seeing the animals at night although no photos turned out. Flash photography prohibited because it disturbs the animals.
,,Awesome Place - Night Safari in Singapore,5.0,,It's one of the World's first Nocturnal Zoo and it's one of the most popular Tourist attractions in Singapore and it's currently houses over more than 2500 animals really it's awesome one must visit this place.
,,Incredibly crowded and not that good,1.0,,"I have never been to a tourist attraction so crowded as the night safari. We went at opening time on a saturday night and the lines where massive to firstly get through the front gate and then to get onto the tram.
The nocturnal show was average at best and the tram was nothing special with most the animals being in the singapore zoo (only ones that weren't were deers).
The walking trails may have been good (and less crowded) but after a full day of sight seeing we were just not up to walking around anymore.
Try going on a week day, get there after 9.00 and skip the tram and you might enjoy it."
,,The world's famous Night Safari in Singapore,5.0,,"Saw lots of nocturnality animals at Night Safari in Singapore.

Unfortunately, the pictures took were too dark to see, but watching them closely was really interesting experience.

It was also good exercise for walking 2 to 3 km in this park while looking around them.

If you are tired, you can still use the trum car to enjoy the adventure here."
,,Thrilling experience,5.0,,"The Night Safari will surely provide you with a thrilling experience that you can cherish throughout your lifetime. People are taken in groups in a large open caddy to explore the safari area at night. Here you can enjoy watching various animals from a very close distance in an open environment. Most of the animals are nocturnal animals, however; it is a great thrill to watch some wild animals like lions and tigers at night from such close distance. After the caddy ride, people can also explore various paths of the night safari by walking in specially designed areas, but one needs to be extra careful while doing this especially while taking pictures as the animals may get disturbed due to the flash and there are strict instructions to turn off the flash.

There are also shows were various nocturnal animals perform various fun activities. One can also enjoy the foods in the night safari from the many stalls that are available throughout the safari. The Night Safari is definitely a place to visit in Singapore."
,,"Not exactly ""bang for the buck""",3.0,,"If you're going to visit here, use the coupon wherein you can get to all the attractions in the area (Singapore zoo, river safari, night safari).

We only went here for the night safari and didn't enjoy it much for the price.

I previously went to River Safari and felt my money's worth there."
,,Waste of Time and Money,2.0,,"Total waste of time.
Have to travel for almost 40 minutes to reach there.
Wait in long queues for the tickets
Wait in even longer queues to get to the trams
Tram rides are just hyped...20 minutes and its over after taking us through the zoo and showing us these animals which have been doctored it seems to be there.
DONT GO IF YOU CAN MISS IT.... USE UP THE TIME FOR SOMETHING MORE USEFUL."
,,Night Zafari,5.0,,"Impressive to stay at night in a zoo. The later the tram tour starts, the more silent it gets. Really a great experience. The creatures of the night show was worthwhile watching it."
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,"What the Night Safari succeeds at, more than any other zoo that I have visited, is making the guests forget that they're in a zoo. The darkness is a big factor in that. As you walk or ride the tram, you notice the animals and not the enclosures, and it really gives a convincing illusion of encountering these animals in the wild.

Our son, age 8, loved it, although he was a bit nervous at times and decided not to go into the bat walk (my wife and I took turns walking through, and it was great), so younger kids may find some of it frightening.

We arrived after 8:30 after a bit of a slow start, and a fair amount of bus/subway travel. There is timed admission, so we entered at 9 PM, but the very entertaining fire show took place in the entrance area so the wait was not a problem at all. Entering at 9 we were able to catch the Creatures of the Night show, then board a tram and do just about all of the walking exhibits at the tram station before catching one of the last trams back before closing time. We missed some of the walking attractions, so you should probably arrive earlier than we did if you're determined to see everything, but we were very satisfied with seeing almost all of the attraction.

This is a truly unique and immersive experience and well worth a visit."
,,Disappointing place to bring overseas guests,3.0,,"We were delighted to bring our overseas guests to have dinner and visit this exciting night safari. We were told that the food stalls there were amongst the best in Singapore. Regrettably, this was not the case! We were so embarrassed when even the most famous of dishes like Laksa turned out totally unauthentic. The signage was very poor, which caused delay and undue stress as our guests got lost in the muddle.
Then when we queued up for the tramcars, the crowds were so huge, it was difficult to enjoy the evening, as there were no friendly stewards around to reassure us whether we could get on any tram! We had to wait for a very long time, and my friends' backs were hurting. When we did get on the tram, we enjoyed the tour of the many animals in the Safari."
,,Great experience,4.0,,Great experience. It was also good to go when the sun had set rather than traipsing around during the mid day heat.
,,Amazing experience at the night safari,5.0,,"Lovely place to spend the evening. Though I had to take multiple transport systems to reach the place, but still worth it.
The experience was amazing. The place is really well managed.
It's better to book your ticket online to avail ongoing discounts. The food outlets outside are good too, lots of options.
Don't miss the open walks before or after the scheduled safari, it is a superb experience. Gave me goosebumps on few stretches when I wasn't surrounded by other travellers.
Must visit place while you are in Singapore."
,,Overcrowded attraction,2.0,,"This receives a lot of publicity and, as a result, is very crowded. You should book in advance, but you'll still have big line-ups to get in, and an even bigger line up (1 or more hours) if you want to use the transport (which is the only way to see some of the animals). It is possible to walk around a part of the collection."
,,Average,3.0,,"For the price people pay, the whole thing is a bit average. The enclosures and everything is very artificial. If you're not comfortable with the dark this is not for you as you're on a open tram going through windy paths in almost pitch black rainforest and can be unnerving. There is only one stop about 5 mins into the ride that you can get off at and there are no other areas one can disembark if they wanted to, not sure if this is ideal for people with smaller children who may get scared.

The animals are dimly lit so you could hardly see them or make out what they were. Majority of these creatures aren't nocturnal so they were sleeping anyway. The ones we saw looked very sad and like they were in super small enclosures that were way too close to the tram, I'm not sure how happy or comfortable the animals would have been. It's more like a Zoo that you can drive around and the animals are uncomfortably close up. There's no point in bringing a camera as no flash photography is allowed, which is fair enough as it would startle and can potentially blind animals. But this means people can't take pictures of the animals and there are non available for sale either.

The Night show was entertaining but again a bit fake. A lot of turning lights off and on which could upset little ones.

I enjoyed the food but for the $170 the 2 of us paid to get there, eat and get back again it was not worth it."
,,night safari,4.0,,It is one of its kind in Singapore . It is basically a zoo in which we can see the animals and its behaviour at night .
,,Quite OK but lively experience,4.0,,"Night Safari experience, i went along with my wife for honeymoon,
Night safari did not long last more than 1 hr
But there was a huge queue for Night Safari.
Our guide made it so easy and fast for us. Thanks for makemy trip and Luxury travels Singapore.
Though many wild animals were tired and sleeping. But we could also see animals in touching distance. Very lively.

Most attractive part is Night show. Host who presented the show was awesome.Her accent was superb

Pros
1)Night show
2)Maintenance of the zoo
3) Liveliness

Cons:
Since many animals (including Lion) slept , it was a little bit of disappointment.

Overall worth a visit once for differnt experience"
,,Good not great. Fun not exciting.,3.0,,"Night safari exhibits numerous animals from around the world. Make sure to visit on a fine night with no rain. It is best to walk around the entire park to see all that is on offer in addition to taking the tram ride which offers narration in Chinese and english. It is hard to get a good look at all the animals in the dark, and no photography is alowed."
,,"Nice and enjoyable, but not a safari",3.0,,"The tour of the ""safari"" is very nice during night time. The tour is given through a train ride, but with the posibilty to jump off and walk around too. However, is is not a safari. Its a zoo tour during the dark hours."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"Night safari is a good experience overall . Nothing is like out of the world but everything is pretty good to go there once . The fire show at the start is ordinary to say the least . However the show that happens after entering (happens every hour at 8 ,9 and 10 , check schedules) is unique and worth the time . Apart from the tram ride where you generally see most animals , so the walking trails"
,,Good experience - A must go.,4.0,,Nice place to go. Food a little pricey then again it is a tourist attraction. Lockers available for rent at $3. Show was good. Staff very well informed and polite. Must go.
,,Find Somehting Else To Do,1.0,,"Probably the most disorganised and 'so not worth the money' tours I have ever done. After getting on and off numerous buses among complete chaos and disorganisation by the tour operator, we finally arrived at the zoo. Unfortunately the night we went, it was raining so we had to stay on the tram and were not allowed off to walk any of the paths. We saw no animals and were told if we did see any (from the tram!), that flash photography was not allowed (understandable). As we could not get off the tram the whole trip around the zoo in the dark on the tram, took about 30 minutes, after which we were dropped back to the restaurant/bar area to wait for our bus back into the city. The prices at these food and beverage establishments were astronomical!!
All in all, I would not recommend this tour to anyone - based on our experience - and if you want to see animals, go during daylight hours on a fine day and take your own food and drinks."
,,Fantastic !,5.0,,"Did the night bus tour and to be honest was not over keen, my daughter had prebooked a visit with my grandkids so I wanted to spend time with them, I was so glad we did this trip it was an amazing experience. I was expecting to see or should I say struggle to see various nocturnal animals, (based on past experience ) how wrong I was.

The place is so well organised, you travel around on a ""road train"" and you get to see Lions, Leopards, Flying fox, bats, etc. All in dimly lit areas but easy on the eye and with running comentry , takes a couple of hours, allowing for frequent stops to be able to get off and back on the train thus allowing a walk through many of the displays."
,,Great experience,5.0,,We really enjoyed ourselves. It was great fun to see all the animals at night and it was an experince we had never done before. The elephants are beautiful and the ride in the dark is fun. The earlier time slot got very busy so i would book in advance for that time. The open top bus on the way back was so much fun!
,,Good,5.0,,"This is a good place to go with your kids as it is convenient and exciting for the kids. Few tips for fellow visitors is as following:
1. While queuing up its recommended to take the left most queue so that you can enjoy the fire show as it takes place while queuing.
2. Do not miss the show and rather take it first before taking the battery tram.
3. Do get down at trails and hop the tram again else the ride will be pretty short.

Hope the tips help :)"
,,Nice family trip,4.0,,"Expected a bit more, but it was still nice. Maybee next time I would rather pick a daytime activity if coming back to the zoo."
,,a purely avoidable place,1.0,,"this is a place which can very easily be avoided at least for people visiting from india. there are no clear views, distance from animals is too much specifically when seeing from tram. we get more clear & nearer view in indian safaries and wild life sancturies. even the variety of animals is also more in indian sancturies. the show is also very common."
,,View of the place,4.0,,"Visited this place in Oct, Quite a nice place to visit, alot of people when i visit. You can choose to walk or take trams but the queue for the trams is very long. Waiting time for the trams is about 30 mins to 45 mins depends on the crowd. You can choose to walk first then took trams at station 3 to continue the journey to see the animals or continue to walk."
,,Good sighting,4.0,,Best zoo to see the nocturnal animals at night. Also the tram ride is good if you are tired and do not want to walk however will recommend doing the walks as you get to feel the real night safari in its settings. Donot miss the show will advise to enter the show at 15 minutes past your entry time first.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Take the train around first to judge the distances to walk the four trails, the fire eating show and animals of the night presentation should be seen too. Plenty of food options. MRT linked by bus to the zoo make for convenient travel."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"It was quiet enjoyable to do the night safari. However, it was sometimes hard to see the animals in the dark. There are long line ups so you may have to wait about 15 minutes or more."
,,Good,4.0,,"Its a nice and the only one of the night safari in the world, the fire show (Thumbuakar Performance) was awesome but the animal show (Creatures of the Night Show) was not that great. The tram ride was good but except few animals, most of them would have been seen in India/USA."
,,Lived both day and night zoo,5.0,,This was our second visit to the zoo. This time we did the night zoo as well as the day. Both times were fantastic. The closeness to animals was great particularly the tiny monkeys near the entrance(day). The setting really changed at night which was superb. Really liked the bus trip through the zoo. This was a real highlight
,,Awesome,5.0,,"If you want to do the Zoo in the cool, then do it at night. The animals are out and more active then in the day. The show was a bit disappointing but there were parts that were entertaining."
,,Enjoyable Night,5.0,,"Okay so we took this trip under a tour guide since it was offered as part of our stay in the hotel. What I love about this is that when you are under a tour guide, the queuing on the lines are relatively cut way shorter than visiting it on your own. We got fast tracked in all the lines that we need to queue, hence we were able to get to see all the attractions (except for the performance of the fire eaters coz it started raining), make sense right hahaha

At first we did not enjoy the train ride safari, coz hey it was dark and the animals are really hard to see (you have to accustom your eyes to the darkness) but since we got more time in hands, we took another train ride and this time, since less people and now accustomed to the darkness we were able to enjoy the ride.

On the side note, if you have kids with you, make sure you have insect repellants with you."
,,World Class Attraction With Mass Tourism Appeal,2.0,,"While the concept of the night safari is unique in the world and the ideas including the shows are really good, the queues are a real funkiller. Even though you have reserved tickets, at least in the earlier hours of the evening the queues to board the trains are horribly long > I had more than 30 minutes waiting time- no fun with excited little children. Then we were also not able to join the performance due to overcrowding. It is not practical with children to go too late when it may be less crowded. I would also like to add that I find the (foodcourt style) meals offered around the venue are in my view overpriced and not authentic enough."
,,Unique!,5.0,,"We took our 5 year old son and he absolutely loved it! Very unique to have a perspective of what happens in the night with the animals. Something that the 5 year old didn't really think about before :)
I thought the park was well organized, the show was funny and engaging and overall a good experience. For residents of Singapore, highly recommend the Friends of Zoo membership so you can do parts of the park on different occasions."
,,Fun adventure,4.0,,"We were unlucky with the weather. They had to pull down drapes on the trains, which means limited view. But all in all, good value for money! Fun adventure. You can take the tram, go on trails and see creatures of the night show. 2-3 hours of things to do ☺️"
,,A must go places in Singapore.,5.0,,Watch the animals in the night and very exciting show for all ages especially for young children. Weathernis cooler as it is at night and zoo staff are very friendly.
,,A bit dissappointed but ....,3.0,,"Long queue if you arrive at appointed time which is probably anyway the thing to do. Fire-eaters were fun and the show doesn't get underway until they have done their thing - a reason to be sufficiently timely that you are near the front of the queue. The night drive through was entertaining enough but the experience does depend on what animals choose to make themselves visible! We were not as lucky as some we spoke to who had had much better luck. The whole experience was predictably a bit ""theme-parky"" but then it has to be one of the busier and more popular venues for tourists (and it seemed locals alike). The taxi considering there were three of us was not overly expensive but getting onto a tour including bus proved impossible at short notice - book in advance, all the tours are much the same and upon arrival all visitors go through the same experience we had apart from ticket purchase."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,Real professionals offering a lifetime experience for all the family. Had a fantastic night to remember.
,,Not a must do,3.0,,"We had a Parkhopper plus ticket and went for Night safari after visiting the zoo. I won't recommend it much if you are short of time/ energy. We just did the tram ride, saw the 2 shows and came back. Fire show is good if you have not seen anything like that before. Creatures of the night show was just ok. We saw some animals during the tram ride, but nothing extraordinary. Most of them can be seen in zoos otherwise."
,,Unique NOCTURNAL experience:),4.0,,"This is definitely a must go for all tourists to Singapore and even Singaporeans themselves. Do get the 3 in 1 zoo passes but DO NOT attempt to do all 3 in one day. You will not be able to enjoy the parks to the maximum.

Look through the brochure and plan your timing well before heading to each location for feeding and the shows etc. Do go about 10-15min earlier for the show because if it's full, you will have to wait for the next show which can be a drag and disruption to your plans. After which, when you are all tired, take a leisure tram ride around the park just to listen to the commentary and know more about these nocturnal animals.

Definitely a must go place."
,,New Experience Night Zoo,4.0,,"It really new and was the first time with the family being in this safari night we all like the idea it was Sunday and very crowded for first entry they have animal show at7:30 and 8:30
You have 2 choices either enter and go directly to animal show then you can ride at any time it will take around 45 minutes
Or ride the first and you will finish around 8:15 pm so you can attend the second show
You will love it"
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,"we had the best night, and skip the line was great, we got straight on the tram, the crowds were huge so this was the way to go, we had a good night my only issue was dinner, my sister said it was lovely and she enjoyed it, but myself and my daughter cant eat seafood or chilli so there was not really any alternative for us to eat except sweets, but it was still a great night and so well organized"
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Saw many animals at quite a close quarters,from African elephants to Indian tigers to Lions. A wonderful experience,a must see"
,,Good for the kids!,4.0,,"We're Singaporeans who live in Hong Kong and we did the night safari for the kids as the youngest was only a baby when we last visited. As it was a weekday night, the crowd was reasonable and we waited about 10 minutes for the tram. Recommend that you purchase tickets online as you get ushered through the entrance faster. We saw more animals this time round and could have seen more if you venture on foot down the trails. It's a good thing perhaps to have your dinner or supper somewhere else as the restaurants and food stalls were packed with tourists - I suppose they do not have the chance to get a taste of local food else where? If you have time, go some place else for food - better variety, taste and cheaper! Anyway, the shows were the highlight for the children."
,,Late review,5.0,,"This Zoo i believe is the most beautiful in earth and so large. If you go there spend a full afternnon and book the night zoo safari. This is a must see, really enjoyed it. I have been there 3 times already and will go again"
,,A better zoo option,4.0,,"I do have concerns about keeping animals in captivity but this does seem to be one of the better experiences for animals and visitors alike.

The benefits of the night safari are that the animals are awake - doing what they naturally do, and it is cool enough to take your time around the zoo.

There us a team that takes you around and it is possible to get off midway to walk around some of the enclosures.

It's a good idea and largely the animals seem at ease. It's not cheap though!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Fun place for every one, one of a kind, , open at seven, train ride is good get the chance to see lot of animal and also do the walk so see animals closely , we enjoyed"
,,try avoiding the weekend night saferi.the crowds r big.,3.0,,"we made a mistake of visiting the saferi on a weekend and ended up waiting in ques weekend we missed out on a show because it was overcrowded.do use the tram if walking is tough,since it is a long walk every where.book the multi park tickets they are far more cheaper.on line booking is the best.if animals r your thing this is a must do."
,,Not as good as everyone says,2.0,,"I wouldn't waste your time or money. Not sure why everyone loves this so much. The actual zoo during the day is way better. They feed them to keep them up. The tram only stopped a couple of times and because we were at the back we missed a lot of the view. It didn't stop at the elephants or lions, driving through so fast you barley got to see them. Disappointed that we didn't get to see the pandas."
,,Nocturnal,3.0,,If you want to see animals sleeping go here! Uhhm why are they sleeping?!? Animals are tired i guess :(
,,Very Underwhelming,2.0,,"We made a mistake and decided to do the Night Safari instead of the Zoo/Breakfast. We booked a tour which was a poor start ... rather than just doing our own thing. The tour guide was ordinary and repetitive and we felt like sheep being herded from place to place.

The train tour around the facility doesn't allow you time to really see and observe the animals... give it a miss and walk around if you have the time. The night animal show was also very underwhelming. Having been to Australia Zoo in Queensland I guess my expectations were too high."
,,Excellent Safari,5.0,,"I got to see many Nocturnal animals and was amazed at their living habitat. The Tram ride is worth the wait to have a look around the Zoo.
They have quite a few trails, the river cat trail has a cage full of bats and you can walk inside, which was an amazing experience for me."
,,Nice.. Worth Watching,4.0,,"This is Worth Watching than Watching the Zoo in the Morning :).

Nice pleasant trip by the train across the Zoo , Good Views of the animals as if you are watching them really in the wild. Kids shall definitely love it. Only that the Scope of animals you will have a look at is limited. But still worth going for it once."
,,Nice but not World Class,3.0,,"Went to the Singapore Zoo along with my Kids. It is noce, with some nice Rockery Work done all along the Zoo. But not really a Zoo where you would say a WOW. the animals are quite normal ones which you can look around easily anywhere else except for some wild animals. But not impressive. The Only Plus is a Night Safari which could be exciting for the KIDS. The Zoo also hosts some Shows in the middle which generally are House Full. These shows can be exciting."
,,One of its kind,5.0,,"The night safari in Singapore zoo is one of its kind experience. The feeling of watching all the wild animals in the night, just a few feet away from you, in a soundless electric car is a unique experience. This surely is one of the biggest attractions in Singapore and must be visited, by people of all ages."
,,different look,4.0,,"Took the night safari, and it was absolutely lovely to see the animals being active in the twilight. Can only recommend this experience to anyone who is in town."
,,Great to do.,5.0,,This was one of the highlights of my stopover trip in Singapore. You'll get closer to animals that you think and all in a safe and clean environment. I'd heartily recommend it to visitors
,,Good Outdoor Activity,4.0,,"This review is quite late. For visitors arriving Singapore late at night but want a place to explore during the wee hours of the evening, the Night Safari is a good way to spend the evening outdoor."
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,"Lovely to be taken round the night safari in the trams, very interesting with excellent commentary. We didn't take full advantage of everything on offer (trails & walks etc.) but enjoyed what we did see. Probably a little expensive unless you do take full advantage of what there is to see."
,,Ticked off the 'to do' list!,3.0,,"MMmmmm - where to start? You book a time slot for your visit, stand in long queue waiting to enter straining to see a display of fire-eating which isn't going to happen unless you are at the front or push your way through the throng to see it! We went on a Wednesday night and it was packed so at the weekend it'll be heaving!! You then queue for ages to get through the ticket booth to be faced with a choice of the tram ride or Creatures of the NIght show. Both are packed!! The tram ride is OK, don't see very much tbh - a lot of the animals are either sleeping, sitting watching yet another tram of people driving by or eating!! The creatures show is mildly entertaining - on our visit one of the animals wasn't playing the game which threw the presenters some what but showed that ultimately the animals are in charge!!
It may different at the weekend but it seemed that most visitors did the tram ride, the show and then leave the park - this meant that the park was very quiet by 10pm! We did a couple of the night walks which were pleasant enough but quite scary in parts (well for my friend they were!!).
Don't expect to be able to take many brilliant pictures unless you have a very expensive camera with a decent infrared lens...
The gift shop(s) have a good range of items in them, some of which are really good value.
Another thing ticked off my 'to do' list...not sure if I'd do it again but if you are a visitor to Singapore I'd suggest it's one of your must do things as it is for most people."
,,definitely one to see!,5.0,,"well priced, the tour finishes around 10/11 pm, very different, must see! there is 3 different parts to the tour including shows and tours"
,,An unusual experience,5.0,,Going on the nght safari is definitely a worthwhile and different experience. You travel in an electric train which allows the animals to come closer with soft lighting so they can be seen. No flash photography so you need longer exposures.
,,unsatisfactory us around the park was too fast and we didn't see many animal,3.0,,we were a little disappointed in this. The train that took us around the park was too fast and we didn't see many animal
,,Where Santa parks his reindeer,3.0,,"We visited here 15 years ago and loved it. But, to be honest, there are so many deers there that it really should be called Santa's reindeer park. We bought discount tickets via the app on the smart phone from the hotel and I'm glad. I'm not a big supporter of zoos and I think I am now done. The animals didn't look that happy and with every second enclosure being full of deers, I just felt that I really could have spent my limited time in Singapore somewhere else. If you have young children, then it would still be fun but there is so much to see (and eat) here, that I wish I planned a better activity in my limited time."
,,Very unique experience,4.0,,"While its tougher to see the animals than the daytime zoo, its a worthwhile experience that you wont find anywhere else.

As others have said, booking ahead online will save you money and make entry a little faster. Also, its better to walk first and take the tram later - you'll spend less time waiting in line and see different animals.

Make sure to bring bug spray - there are mosquitos around.

We spent 2.5 hours there without seeing the show."
,,"Amazing experience, but the queues are ridiculous",5.0,,"Did I mention queues? Oh, this place is busy, very very busy! We only came half an hour after the opening and already hundreds upon hundreds of people were in the park waiting to get in and we could only get the 9 o'clock slot ourselves. But after the long wait and the great fire show, we absolutely loved the whole experience of seeing the animals up close. First we took the tram, then got off and walked around the whole park again. We really enjoyed the night safari and thought this was the best attraction we've been to in Singapore. Thoroughly recommended!"
,,Enjoyed this.,4.0,,Wonderful and a must see place to visit when in Singapore. they take you around in a little bus or wagon like vehicle.
,,mildly overrated,4.0,,we had to wait in a long queue for getting into the night safari tram. But the experience was good. Most animals made appearance or made to make an appearance. Overall good but the zoo is an better option.
,,Overrated,1.0,,This is one of the most overrated places in singapore. Visit Singapore Zoo or Jurong Bird Park instead of Night Safari. They take you in a tram and roam around in the park where you can see animals in night. Neither you not your kids will find this interesting in Night light.
,,"For a great experience, walk the park first, and get on the tram afterwards.",5.0,,"Despite the huge queues for tickets, admittance, trams, there's not that much time lost.
Use the pre-defined walking trails to get the most out of the night safari experience.
Don't be afraid of going inside the bat cave. It's harmless and you get to sit 1 foot away from huge bats.
Consider visiting the night safari together with the Zoo, as the location is remote from most touristic attractions. I would recommend getting to the Zoo 2.5 hours before closing time, then having dinner, and then go into the night safari with the first group."
,,Good experience but very Poorly Organized,3.0,,"We had viator passes and swapped them for tickets when we reached the place. We reached 20 minutes before our tour time but still could not enter because you need to be in queue 45 minutes prior to your tour time! This is something not mentioned by anyone - neither in the brochures, by the viator agent or the hotel guys so be very cognizent of this fact and plan your trip accordingly.

So we queued for close to an hour outside and it was really hot. No air conditioned walkways unlike other attractions. There was a fire eating dance show going on right next to the entrance queue which added to the heat and was uncomfortable! There were about 4-5 lines and only those on the left most queues could see the entire thing as its not on a stage. We were in the right most and caught just a few glimpses of it but plenty of the heat.

After getting through the entrance, you need to head for the tram boarding points if you are going on that (which you should as it takes you around and shows all the animals). There was a rush for queues again here which really really sucked after having to queue just to get in for an hour already! The bad part here was that after you enter its a free passageway and than you need to find the tram boarding point and rush there to stand in queue again. They have 2 tram boarding stations and after the queue to the 1st tram station is pretty full they allow the people to go to the 2nd tram station. So people who would have been towards the end of the entrance queue outside got to be at the head of the 2nd tram station line (sigh!) Both the trams leave one after the other so hope you get the point! Another drawback - the tram queues were narrowly boxed in so had to fold up the Pram and carry it as well! Took close to an hour here again to board the tram

Once you are on the tram and it starts moving - its great! You get a close up view of the animals, the night time lighting, the feeding, the commentary - everything is superb. They have various points along the ride where you have an option to get off and go on the walking trails - you can reboard the next tram but given the harrowing time we had boarding the tram the first time round decided not to risk it! Good thing is that they don't crowd you into the tram and you can sit comfortably

If not for the poor management at both the entry queues and tram boarding queues would have been an excellent outing. They really should manage it better and cut down on the waiting time. This is a place where usually children visit and its really makes them cranky standing around in queues and waiting for so long! Even adults would get tired.

Tip - Dress summery but carry a light shawl/sweater as once you are on the tram and into the jungle it gets a little chilly"
,,Long queue..avoid weekends,3.0,,"We bought tickets for 7.15pm tram. Prices of tickets online was cheaper than buying at the counter. When we arrived at 7pm, the line was already there. Estimated to be around 500 people lining up. It took us around 80 minutes before getting on the english tram. My kids were getting impatient for waiting too long. After getting on the tram, it took another 10-15 minutes before leaving the station. There were quite a lot of animals to view on the tram. You can also choose to stop at certain stations and walk on the wallaby trail or leopard trail. But, we didn't stop since we were already tired of standing for 1 hour waiting for our turn. Overall, it's a nice attraction but please avoid weekends. Might be better during weekdays I think."
,,still amazing!!!!,5.0,,visited night safari again on my 2nd trip to singapore after 5yrs -- and still loved it !!!! a beautiful experience of the night safari and animal show!!!! specially this time there it was hosted by an indian -- and was a wonderful experience !!!
,,Great experience,4.0,,"This is a fantastic evening and I really want to give it a 5 star but the evening starts in a poorly organised crowded line where unless you are near the front or over 6 foot you can't see the fire eater show meant to entertain you while waiting. If you are going to have a show to keep the crowds amused put it on a stage high enough for all to see.

My biggest tip is avoid the instant lines for the trams when you get in and walk the trails first and join the tram at a stop further in.

The night show is OK but is not that spectacular and I am not sure I would go and see it again. Better off looking at the animals."
,,Exotic Asian animals up close!,5.0,,"The Night Safari is a must-do for visitors to Singapore. It is very different from a regular zoo experience as you can get incredibly close to the animals on the tram. Most of the creatures you see are native to Asia, making it even more of a unique experience for foreign visitors. I would recommend the Creatures of the Night show as well as walking the path after taking the tram (there are a number of animals you can't see from the train). Admission is a bit expensive, but you can get a discount if you bring your plane ticket for your flight to Singapore!"
,,Book Online to Reserve a Time and Avoid Longer lines,5.0,,"What I wish we had known in advance was that you can book online and reserve a time slot. If you show up to the zoo (even if you come early), typically the first one to two hour time slots to enter the park are filled up. If you book online however, your time slot is reserved and you can just show up and get in line to enter the zoo for that time slot. And while you are waiting to enter, they have a fun little fire show to keep people of all ages entertained. Also, if you show up and did not buy a ticket online, you will wait for a long time in the zoo ticketing line. Online is quicker and offers a 10% discount too so it is worth it.

As for the Zoo Night safari itself. You can take a tram and tour most everything that way, which i recommend for people who cannot walk alot, the elderly, families with children, or people who want to just sit back and relax and enjoy the view of the animals. Another option is to walk the paths they have set up, which are labeled very well and are super easy to see at night. We had no issues getting around walking. One trick we learned is station #1 Tram will have the lonest line. If you want to get on the tram, go to a different station like #2 or #3 and the line will be very short and you likely will get on the first tram that arrives. As for the widlife, they are amazing, what you see here is second to none. There is no other zoo in the world that I am aware of that has species from basically every continent so you will see things you have never even heard of. And in some places, the smaller animals get to run across the path in front of you.

Pro - they have shows where families and kids can enjoy seeing some small animals upfront and it only lasts about 30 minutes so worth it if you need a break or distration and need to sit down but want some entertainment. And this is free, it is part of the fee you paid to enter the park so no extra charge for the show.

Con- you are not allowed to have flash on your camera, so prepare ahead of time to ensure any cameras or recordings you bring have the proper lighting to take photos. We did not, so i really dont have a ton of pics to share here with this review due to not knowing this ahead of time.

overall, wonderful experience for a group, solo traveler, couples, families, etc. i belive there is something for everyone here"
,,Great family night-time activity,5.0,,Fantastic night-time activity for the whole family. Highly recommend to do the tram ride which travels around the park and captures the highlights of the night safari.
,,"Mildly exciting, don't expect good pictures!",3.0,,"The night safari is a somewhat fun only because of the novelty of watching animals in the dark (especially for those who haven't been to such night time excursions before). Apart from that there isn't much. Since all the animals there aren't 'nocturnal', they seem tired and are mostly found lazing around. The only time they get active is when they are fed at the night (you can watch some animals being fed at certain specific times). And since the place is not well lit (and rightly so as to not bother the animals), the images taken are not good (increasing exposure time of the camera makes them blurry).
All in all, good fun for children probably, not much for adults."
,,Holiday,4.0,,Went to the Zoo for the second time and this time was the night safari it was ok not as good as l was told by other friends but it was ok.Went 2years earlier and it was great day time .The night Safari might depend on the animals how active they are that night can't take photo with a flash on for The animals eyes. There also was a fire show on that night that was really good .
,,the BEST night safari,5.0,,We visited the night safari with our two boys and they absolutely loved it. We've never been so up and close (no fences) with wild animals. The bat cage was the best. Make sure you bring insect repellent.
,,Excellent activity!,5.0,,"Went here on a school excursion and it was beautiful done! The staff ensured it was easy to get from A-B, the information was excellent regarding the animals and what we need to do as humans to look after them and the enclosures were well lit whilst attending to the animals needs."
,,Interesting concept.....but too like a Disney experience,3.0,,"Queues to buy tickets, queues to enter, and even longer queues for the tram ride. Oh dear, at times it felt like Disney with the roped off lines and the canned commentary. It was fascinating to visit a zoo at night -- and the darkness helped to hide the smallness of some of the animal enclosures. Basically, the animals were ""shown off"" to the best advantage with long narrow enclosures with clever lighting and moats, so it felt like they were close enough to almost reach out and touch them. It appears they are fed at night to keep them active, and who doesn't love seeing baby animals with their mums? But overall, it was an expensive ($45/person entry) zoo experience, and the ""creatures of the night"" show was weak compared to those at Australia Zoo. Note: meal and drink prices are also high ($13.50 for a small bottle of beer)."
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,"Its the first visit for me after over a decade. If you take the 715 entry, be prepared for a crazy wait for everything including tram, show etc. I choose to go in after 815pm and had dinner at Ulu Ulu Safari open air food court first. Didn't make it for the 830 show which was full. I guess it must be the foreign tourist groups. After dinner, we had a walk around the wallaby trail and then made our way to the Tram stop no. 3 to get on the Tram which was halfway through the route. Might have been better to walk through the fishing cat trail first and then get on the Tram at stop 2 or 3. We got back in time for the 930 show which wasn't as crowded. Dont bother with the camera here. Its too dark for any good pics. Highly recommend to walk at least part of the way such as the Panther Trail or the Eastern Lodge to see the Malayan Tiger. We were separated by just the extremely clean glass that I had to stretch out my hand to be sure that we were really protected. The pictures in the brochures that show an up close encounter with the wild cats is real! You really get that close!"
,,One of the best zoos around!,5.0,,Hard to beat this zoo as it's been so well put together especially when combined with the River Safari and Night Safari. There is so much to see and there are great options to take walking trails around the zoo or take the tram. The River Safari option was excellent with interactive displays. Highly recommended.
,,Go later to avoid the rush,5.0,,"An absolute zoo at opening time (pun intended) with little in the way of crowd management around ticketing and a confusing entry system. Staff did very well at admitting people quickly and whisking them onto the tram. Better to take some time at the start to plan your visit, maybe walk some trails and wait for the rush to pass. Filled with families and tourists who don't seem to get that yelling and loud voices aren't conducive to seeing animals.

However overall an incredible experience and well worth a visit."
,,"As per rating average,, not so awesome, not so bad, one time watch",3.0,,"Place was good, many animals were open, night view,,but very less animals will be visible,,It is difficult to spot animals in such darkness,,,animals were not active too.."
,,Worth doing,3.0,,"It's late and the kid's were super tired after doing the day zoo in the afternoon. Doing both saved an extra trip though. The night zoo itself is a bit average as its just looking at animals under low light but when combined with the shows make it worth visiting for the experience. Spent less than two hours and got the taxi back to Orchard for about $25. Can't use the flash so not many options for photos. Also very crowded on a weekend, not sure if its better during the week."
,,Awesome trip,5.0,,Just stay in the car (in the dark) and watch the animals. It was an interesting experience. Or you can choose to walk around to explore for longer.
,,Soooo much fun!,5.0,,This was absolutely brilliant. Advise doing the walking trails and finishing off with the tram when it's a little quieter. Much more fun than an ordinary zoo.
,,Walk the Night Safari,5.0,,"My family visited the Night Safari recently and absolutely loved it. We didn't ride the train that takes you round the park and our experience was all the better for it. If you avoid the crowds and walk the trails, you feel much more like you are on an adventure. The peace and tranquility that goes with getting away from the recorded announcements on the train means that you are much more likely to see the animals' natural behaviour and capture some really special moments. I'm sure the train is fun but walking is so much better!"
,,"There are many invisible animals in this zoo .. if you blink, you might see one.",3.0,,"We decided to do the Night Safari whilst in Singapore, I had done this about 10 years ago and remembered that it was quite good ... well time changes everything.

If you want to see the nocturnal animals in this zoo, avoid the train ride, it's a waste of time ...

As you ride along, the loud speaker tells you about animals that you just can't see .. are they there? or am I going bling?

On your left you will see the Wambesi man eating killer donkey ... nope ... out of all the animals referred to on the ride, you were lucky to see half of them.

Give the train a miss and walk the trails starting with the Leopard Trail, that way you get to see the animals, some of them right up close (hope you aren't scared of bats).

There are places where there are glass walls that let you put your face a couple of inches from a leopard ... you can see him/her but she/he can't see you because of the well planned lighting.

There are the usual gift shops and burger bars (Bongo Burger Bar will make you a Singapore Sling for 18SGD .. but you are better off having a beer).

In my opinion, there are better ways to kill a few hours at night in Singapore."
,,A must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"I have been to the Night Safari multiple times with different groups. It was always a blast to go. The atmosphere is amazing. It is really like walking through the jungle at night.

Pro Tip: Take a walk through the park first and then at the end take the train ride for a nice wrap up. You will see different animals on the tram than when walking through the night safari."
,,Great night activity for couples and families. Bring insect repellent.,4.0,,"Well planned and well thought out concept. Its an great night activity for couples and families but can be a bit touristy. The wild animal show was worth it and the car/train style transport provided to view all the animals was comfortable. Staff were knowledgeable but note that not all nocturnal animals were visible. On arrival, there was a fire show as well as a large range of concession and souvenir stores as well."
,,Great fun,4.0,,We visited the night safari with Tour East the tour from start to finish was amazing with the buffet dinner then the tram tour seeing all of the amazing animals was great don't miss the show at the end
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Excellent experience for the whole family, very informative and enjoyable, highly recommended attraction"
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"The tour of the Zoo was very interesting. The dinner was good, and the staff was very attentive. Nice people Worth going to see."
,,A fun experience,3.0,,"D night safari s wat t says: a safari @ night, which claims to view d animals in deir natural habitat.. D whole place s located a little far from d city, so make sure u reach Der early.. D safari starts as d night falls n consists of guided tram trips through d made-up jungle. Have to admit, made me a little cautious seeing dat d tram was quite open.. But surprisingly d animals were minding deir own business n as long as u don't disturb dem wit noise or camera flash dey r quite harmless. Ts kinda exciting to see d animals walking around nonchalantly especially since ts dark n silent. Remain seated @ all times n make sure ur children r too. Avoid flashlight, camera or video without flash r permitted.
Der r also, few short kinda educational animal shows too associated with d safari.. When we visited, we also could watch a short fire show by 2 talented artists.

Overall, not a bad experience, especially if you ve kids with u."
,,Good evening adventure,4.0,,My adult daughter and I were able to easily purchase tickets on line for a reduced rate. Overall the evening was enjoyable but there are a couple of long lines - one to get in and then one to catch the tram for the tour. Before or after the safari there are lots of spots to eat and buy souvenirs but we chose to get back to the hotel and a taxi was easy to get.
,,Great experience,5.0,,Went on a tour to see this as it felt a bit difficult to get there under our own steam. This had the added advantage of us skipping both ticket queue and queue for the bus tour. We had about two hours there which was a bit short - meant we had to walk quickly to see all the routes. The bats were fab and you got really close but to be honest the whole experience was lovely - felt like you were closer to the animals and able to see them in more natural surrondings
,,Must see,5.0,,It is a must see activity. You will enjoy the tram ride also you can walk the trail of you want to spend more time. You have good eating joints and folic gif all culture. Mush see.
,,Night time with a difference,4.0,,"Not on the MRT network so you either have to get taxi, bus, drive or go on a organised trip to get there. Various food outlets which are not cheap and the usual souvenir stalls. There was a fire eating show before we went in, and various walks if you fancy a stroll round the animals that are obviously in dim light settings. Highlight of the evening is the 50 minute tram ride round the exhibits and a 25 minute show with a ecological theme and audience participation. Fun show and entertaining to see the various animals that are bought out and the antics they perform. The tram ride had an interesting commentary, but the animals you see are very dependent on what's around at the time you go past. We actually did the ride twice and on the second trip there was probably a few more animals around. The Otters were entertaining and the Elephants had a youngster which was lovely to see. But a lot of what we saw were animals sitting down and resting so nothing really spectacular. Worth a trip but wouldn't rush back."
,,Prerecorded tram doesn't cut it,1.0,,"We had been told this was fantastic, but for us it did not live up to the hype. The team tour was a sound recorded tour that was not particularly interesting and sped past all the animals, I think we saw the tiger in about 5 seconds. We were told the team tour would be 45 mins, it was actually closer to 35. Very disappointing wouldn't recommend it"
,,Not worth the time nor the money,2.0,,"This was quite an expensive activity at SGD45 per adult and SGD30 per child.

We arrived shortly before 7.30pm and thus only a small queue for the 40 minute tram ride.

The audio on the tram ride kept breaking down and when it did work it was often out of sync with the feature we were passing. No separate commentary from the driver which other reviewers commented on favourably.

Appreciate these are somewhat wild animals in an open area so sighting can be unpredictable. But we saw little other than a wide range of deer species. Certainly not the breadth of animal life I had expected.

Earlier in the month we went to the Singapore river safari and the zoo and would rate these as much better attractions."
,,Live jungle scene,5.0,,We have visited jungle safari after our cruise visit. I entered at 6 p.m. & enjoyed to see live animals on road.
,,Wonderful way to see the animals up close,4.0,,"This is a late activity for younger children - but if you're travelling and your body clocks are all over the place anyway, it's a perfect way to spend an evening !
We got a tour from the hotel which was good because you got transport there and back, and you got priority in the queues...however it did mean you were constrained by time and we could have done with another hour to see everything without feeling rushed. There is always the option of getting a taxi back if you miss the bus though, and I don't think this is hugely expensive...
The night safari itself is excellent. It really is very dark and the animals are softly lit but you can see them very clearly. You can take the train around (recommended) so you see everything and then can walk around the different areas to spend more time viewing. Lovely and warm this time of year and nice to be out of the sun and heat of the day.
So many beautiful animals here and you are very close to them. The way they've set it up makes it look like there are no fences, so it really feels like a safari. As with everything in Singapore, lovely and clean and tidy, friendly and helpful staff.
Lots of different food places here and of course lots of souvenirs!
Our 5 & 8 year old boys loved this, we would definitely do this again, but with more time to spare."
,,A Memorable Experience,5.0,,"Loved this place! Wasn't prepared for such an enjoyable evening, had read some pretty ordinary reviews before visiting so went prepared for the worst and was pleasantly surprised.
Yes there were lines and lots of people when the gates opened, but they soon dispersed and we spent about three hours enjoying exploring the park. We jumped on and off the tram ride, and went around several times to make sure we saw everything. I recommend not trying to rush a visit - sometimes you have to sit a while to be able to spot the animals in each area, however I don't think there was anything that we didn't manage to see as long as we were patient. It is definitely worth getting out and doing the walks.
Walking through the vegetation in the dark added an extra exciting dimension to the usual zoo visit - especially when the lions were roaring near by!!"
,,A must do in Singapore!,5.0,,"Seeing the zoo at night when the animals are active is definitely a must do activity in Singapore!

I like the fact that we could choose to walk around the park on our own (on the well laid out trails) or to opt to take the tram (which caters to different language groups). We entered the zoo at about 7pm and manage to do both with time to spare. \

I would suggest combining this either with the River Safari or the Zoo itself during the day (not all 3 though as that's just too much for a day)."
,,Night safari - awesome,5.0,,This was such an awesome experience. We travelled on a 'train' and saw the animals in there own habitat at night. A must do while in Singapore.
,,A nice highlight,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari using our Singapore Pass.

We caught the hop on-hop off bus direct from Suntec, and the bus dropped us home close to our hotel.

I enjoyed the safari. Luckily we got there for when it opened, as we were really watching the time towards the end, as we definitely did not want to miss our bus home.

We watched the fire show whilst waiting in line, so couldn't get a great view of it.

Once in, we went straight to the other show. The family enjoyed it. The two presenters were very good.

Once over, we went to the tram ride. We waited about 10 mins to get on. We only hopped off at one stop, otherwise we stayed on the tram. I think you could see most animals whilst on the tram.

It was abit creepy walking around the zoo at night, listening to the lions play up abit. But it was all part of the experience of a night safari, so really a pretty cool thing to do."
,,Best night safari ever for night trekking and family,5.0,,"I had my first experience with my team as part of team dinner. It was amazing experience. The performance, the animals and route setting are well organized. It was very educated and fun trip. I later took my family there, 12 year old girl and 2 boys (10 and 7 years old). They LOVE this place. My little boy loves the show before trams (which I think it's quite boring - but I am sure your kids will love it).
I later visited there for ""night trekking training"". It sounds strange but I did 3 times when I miss night trekking and have time after work. It's a good exercise and not too hot."
,,Great night safari,5.0,,The night safari is well worth it. You are transported slowly around the zoo in a train to view the nocturnal wildlife before a walk around the lit pathways to view the smaller animals. You can catch a public bus but we went there by taxi ($45!) and returned by coach ($6)
,,Close encounters,4.0,,"An enjoyable attraction. We went around on the train twice. The second driver was very engaged with the passengers, which made it far more informative. He also slowed down to make it easier to see the animals. We arrived at opening time (7:15pm); the animals were far more lively around 9pm. The show was rather bland - not much to it really. Walking around the paths was far more fun.

My husband was able to push me around the paths in the wheelchair. It was easy to use the train, and any disabled persons were allowed to enter as ""members"", giving priority. Staff were very helpful.

It was worth the trip to see a range of nocturnal animals, some of which are endangered."
,,More of a family thing,3.0,,"Don't get me wrong. The place is well taken care of. The little tram you'll be sitting in looks fun and you may, or may not - get off for a walk - up to you.
The guide plays an important role - you get the pre-recorded audio but the guide can also talk and bring some fun to it. So again. It's the human touch.
Animals are very relaxed and look like they pose. There are no faces, just a water trench so that made me suspicious as to how these predators are so chilled when there's so much prey just at a stone's throw from them. Anyway, don't wanna make any assumptions.
It's as Singapore intended it to be - family friendly and really secure."
,,Super-Night-Zoo,5.0,,"Great experience, especially for kids. What a different way to see a zoo and animal activity during the night hours. Enjoy!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"My husband and I went tonight and it's amazing, so well organised. We caught the tram which took us around the different animal exhibits and the guide was very informative. We also went to the show where several animals were featured and there was audience participation.

After the show we hsd the most delicious Asian dinner, the restaurants are very well organised. There are also really nice gift shops would love to go back next time we are in Singapore"
,,Simple,4.0,,I heard not so good things about this place. But i liked this place. The tram ride was amazing. And you can see all the animals easily.
,,Great fun,4.0,,Great fun. Went there with kids and we all enjoyed it. Could end up being a bit late with young children (ours are 6 and 8) so they were a bit tired.
,,Dont do it,1.0,,"Not worth to spent time or money. Very unfriendly stuff, very crowded. We call it a tourinepp (ripping off tourists). And you dont really see a lot of animals."
,,"""Amazing""",4.0,,"We went on a tour here, first we had a fanstatic buffet dinner and then went on a train ride through the zoo and at night was a real adventure to see and hear all the animals, would recommend this tour."
,,Good value,5.0,,"The Night Safari is a great little evening trip. Not cheap, but nothing in Singapore is, and this is good value for the money. The priority boarding for the tram is indispensable. The regular queue must have been 70 minutes long, and we got boarded right away. The tram tour itself is great, but I would have liked a bit more free time before having to board the bus back to the hotel. But the transport to and from is a nice perk, given how out of the way the zoo is. Would recommend this to anyone visiting even just one night in Singapore. The chicken tikka was surprisingly good, but a bit slow thanks to long lines at all the restaurants."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"The Night Safari is somewhat different and a lot smaller than Singapore Zoo and consists of traveling only by tram around the park. The tram ride is approx 40 mins. You will most defiantly have the opportunity to see the nocturnal animals, some of which are very close to the tram line and you may even see them crossing in front of you.

There are plenty of place to have dinner once your tram ride has concluded, along with souvenir shops to make purchases."
,,Very beautiful place ... Awesome experience!,5.0,,A very beautiful place to gain an awesome experience and insight on the night life of the animal kingdom! Would highly recommend - especially for nature lovers.
,,Night Safari a must!,4.0,,"The night safari was a lovely change from a day Zoo experience. The tram ride was informative and a great way to start your visit. Priority queueing fees worth the extra. Don't visit this Zoo without walking all the trails if possible. You don't see everything from the Tram! VERY expensive food, drink and souvenirs. A well set out experience and a very interactive feel with very little visible fencing. We will return for the River Safari next time as it has peaked our interest."
,,Nice,5.0,,"The place is nice and well organized
I loved the fire show at the entrance .. at first I thought its ordinary but they ended up doing some talented tricks with fire.

The animal night show is nothing special

The safari itself Has a lot of strange animals to see for my self i liked the bats and that i was really close to them"
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"What better way is there to experience a zoo than in the cooler part of the evening when the animals actually WANT to be active! Enjoy detailed paths that give you a closer look at each of the animals, or take the included 45 minute tram ride through the park and enjoy every animal that way! Excellent family experience while in Singapore!"
,,Different,5.0,,"We love zoos, so this was definitely on the to do list. We started with the buffet meal included in the trip, which was excellent although slightly rushed as we needed to queue for our tram. The animals were closer than expected so would have liked the tram to pause a little to take photos. I took some later on the walking trails. Definately recommend this as it is very different."
,,"I am not biased, it is really good!",5.0,,"I last visited the Night Safari more than 12 years ago, quite a sad thing for a local... When I re-visit again last weekend, I was really impressed.

We started the visit with a tram ride that was included in the ticket, it took about 40mins or so. The tram ride was like a brief introduction to the park. It was really serene at night, the guide on the tram was constantly reminding everyone not to make loud noise or take flash photography. The tram ride bring you up close to some animals, we were so close to a Tapir that we can touch it! (Probably not allowed though)

After the tram ride, there are trails to follow. These trails leads you to artificial caves, waterfall and a stroll into the rainforest. There were quite a few ""walk-through"" that let you be up close again with animals like kangaroo?, flying foxes etc! Nice!

The part that awed me most was how the whole park was integrated into the rainforest! It look so natural and does not look like a man-made park at certain part.

Well done! The Night safari and the river safari are really world class attraction."
,,"By the tram, and the Night creatures show are good",4.0,,"Night safari by tram is very well recommended. while you wait for the tram ride, you'll have a trible Fire show which is nice to watch. After the tram ride, there's another show on night creatures that is another must watch."
,,a must do,5.0,,"This is an excellent place to visit, made more enjoyable seeing the animals in the low light . A wonderful experience."
,,Must do,5.0,,Was a fantastic evening. Reccomend getting the jump the que tram ticket. Very cool walking around and looking for animals at night. Unique experience to singapore you won't regret
,,Animals lit up in the dark,5.0,,"We decided to spend a full 12 hours and do the Zoo, the River Safari and the Night Safari on the same day.
Doable in 12 hours (including travel from downtown) but still a long day.
Top pick - Night Safari, followed by the Zoo, and lastly the River Cruise. The latter was a bit of a disappointment after the S.E.A. Aquarium on Sentosa.
Ticket tip - the ""4 Parks"" ticket is very good value (the 4th one is the Jurong Bird Park) but we didn't get to that one.
Eating tip - the food selection at the entrance to the Night Safari is far better than at the Zoo."
,,Night Zoo disappointment,2.0,,"Sadly the night experience wasn't what we remembered. They are pushing out several shows a night and the animals were not really cooperating. The train tours was nice, but the sound track had problems and wasn't well coordinated. Night zoo, day zoo and river cruise - should all be one place to visit."
,,Night Safari is wonderful.,5.0,,We had a wonderful experience. To see the animals at night is amazing. I was stunned at how beautiful the flamingos were in the night light. The night safari is a must. It is something that you must not miss.
,,"This is not a safari, it is a zoo",2.0,,"This is an oddly popular evening event, but I'm at a loss to understand why. If you visit on your own, there are hideous queues, and if you go within a tour (as we did) the queues are much smaller but you end up seeing so little, just rather poor amateur 'shows', a tram/trolley ride with canned audio and very limited animal views."
,,Nice evening with nocturnal animals,4.0,,"I went here with a friend of mine and we enjoyed ourselves. Make sure to also walk around on the trails to see more animals. Also don't forget to go through the mangrove area where you will see huge bats right next to you hanging on the trees. All in all a good experience and if you have some time to spare, try this unique attraction."
,,just okay,3.0,,"Compare with the price that I must pay. it just so so. They give some welcome attraction on the beginning of the trip, but a bit too standard. I was expecting to get more for what i have paid."
,,Wow,5.0,,This is a must do whilst in Singapore. The park opens at 7pm and you are privy to the animals in their natural habitat and also the comfort of darkness which means a lot more activity then usual. Great night out!
,,Singapore Odyssey,4.0,,"Must do.If you are in Singapore a few nights this is really worthwhile. No obvious fences just moats.If animals have to be kept in captivity this is as gentle as it gets.At night everything appears natural and the animals I saw appeared fine.(I am not a zoologist,however.) A nice night out and better than most zoos I have been to."
,,Really good,5.0,,A really different way to experience a zoological collection. Booked 8.15pm entry but this does mean that by the time you have seen everything and caught bus #138 back to Ang Mo Kio the MRT will have stopped or be stopping - we got as far as Bishan then took taxi ($15 to Chinatown) as buses had stopped too. Should not put you off going as it is amazing
,,Good family place,4.0,,"Had a good time with the zoo, not so suitable for the teens especially as its just tram rides and the shows. Good experience nonetheless but prefer the days when they have events and activities like Halloween."
,,Heartbroken,1.0,,"I see the majority of people who posted bad reviews about the night safari only complained about it being a waste of money. Honestly, that was the least of my issues. Yes, it was pricey for what was offered. However, my main concern were the animals! Most of their enclosures are not big enough for them and they lack stimulation. They all looked bored and unhappy. The most striking example of that was the serval (wild african cat) - It was constantly pacing up and down along the edge of it's enclosure for ages without stopping! I felt stressed watching it. And if you are an animal lover and know enough about them, you will know that this a sign of distress and a lack of stimuli. Meaning it's enclosure is way too small for the animal, and/or it is unhappy in it's environment. This really broke my heart, and it's such a shame to see animals like this in captivity. They are supposed to be well taken care of. If anything, provide them with a better and more spacious environment, as well as more stimulating activities. Animals are not just for show. You are a zoo. Know how to treat them. Even all the elephants were rocking their heads from side to side, which is not normal at all. It is caused by boredom, frustration and desolation. And I really do hope someone does something for these poor animals. I will definitely be writing to the zoo."
,,Amazing Safari,5.0,,"Very organized zoo & easy to understand map, there awesome show and walk trails you should not miss, food are good also there is Indian buffet and different categories of food."
,,Ok,3.0,,We waited all holiday for this. I was pretty disappointed as it was one of the top things I was looking forward to
,,Night Safari - well worth it.,4.0,,"If you have seen zoos before on your travels, then try the Singapore Night Safari. An amazing experience. Buy the tickets online. They have a 730 ,830 and 930 pm settings. The 730 seems to be the very busy one as ppl with kids aim for that one. We did the 830 and found by 9pm the trains were virtually empty and our wandering around was relaxed and unimpeded."
,,Birthday at the zoo,5.0,,"Ok first thing. The zoo tells you you can have fees entry if it's your birthday. If you are Singaporean yes. Anywhere else - no.

Secondly, you get a 10% discount if Yu got to Singapore via Singapore airlines.

Thirdly there are shuttle buses that will take you to and from the zoo. I know from the zoo to Clarke Quay its SGD 6. The pick up maybe a bit harder as I didn't do this.

However the night zoo is worth it. The animals are far more active at this time and you get to see them in a far different environment. Well worth it."
,,Average experience/ 3 hours can spend there.,3.0,,"Night safari is different experience. It's far from city but taxi options are there. Expensive but for children it's different jungle feeling& watch animals in night. Trams are good & convince. Fire show , is good."
,,Breathtaking close contact night safari,5.0,,"Loved the close contact with such amazing animals like the Rhinoceros ,Bull Elephant (that looked like a woolly mammoth up close) There are ditches between you and the large animals and no fences. Makes for an amazing experience! Expect long queues, this part of the world is used to waiting in line and its a very popular attraction. Great fun watching the fire eaters whilde awaiting ourturn on transport. Will be revisiting this zoo next year as I ran out of time to see everything you can on the day enterance but are restricted on the night safari to specific areas on zoo transport carriages with some areas you can walk through if you have enough time!"
,,Fun night at the zoo,4.0,,"We booked through Viator for a guided tour and had a great time. We were collected from our hotel and taken to a meeting place where we joined one of several buses. Our guide was informative and funny. We had to wait a little while to get on a tram at the zoo, but included in the price was priority access, so the wait was ok, and our guide actually checked and kicked people off who had sneaked through!

Zoos are always hit and miss in terms of seeing animals, as they might be asleep or somewhere else, but we saw enough (and close up) to make for a satisfying trip. Part of the adventure was the bus trip across Singapore to get there :) I like the idea of the night visit, as it had a whole different feel and many of the animals were actually awake! We would do it again."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We did the Zoo by day and decided (although almost didn't) to do the Night Safari. It was brilliant. You get into the world of the animals and really see them in context. You go on a train and get a chance to walk round a small section. You can do the whole in your own time. Downside, awful cues, they time entrance, but it all becomes a mele. Once in, it is worth it."
,,Average experience,3.0,,"Our Night safari experience was average , The 40 minute tram ride to see the animals was very short and we saw very few animals . The lions , elephants , rhino , zebras , giraffe were there to be seen . The animal show was good and kids enjoyed .
By the time we came out to see the fire show at 9 pm it started to rain and hence the show was cancelled which disappointed us .Not a must for those who are not animal lovers
Can be skipped in my opinion"
,,Love this safari,4.0,,This safari is always a pleaser. Have been here multiple times and always great to see the animals at night. Only complaint I have is the food on the outside. The food is extremely overpriced! We paid $55 for 2 burgers and chips then $15 for a 1 scoop ice cream cone.
,,Expensive and disappointed,2.0,,"Getting there is easy enough between bus and MRT system. The entry to the park is Sin $45. The lines to get in the tram are long, and the tram tour is about 35minutes. The amphitheater show is lame, with bad acting for attempted entertainment purposes. No flash videos or photo for evident reasons, makes ot hard to get decent pix...The animals are beautiful and seem well kept, as well as their habitats. Some areas have very strong odors. The bathroom inside the park are clean. The food was pricey too. Sin $17-23 for one meal at the ulu ulu restaurant. Drink Not included."
,,Great place to explore with the family. Load up on the insect repellents first!,4.0,,"Great place to burn off the extra calories with the family! I won't tell you about the exhibits, just read the other reviews. As a local who visits this place often i will share with you the tips to get the most out of the trip.
Attire: Long pants and sneakers, sweat absorbing polo tee shirt. No short skirts and slippers or you will quickly regret it. Put on insect repellent liberally before the trip.
Timing : Avoid weekends where possible. To get the most out of this trip, be prepared to spare at least 3hrs. 4hrs is the best.
Things to bring : A tiny map light to read the map in the dark, a handheld fan, bottles of drinking water.
F&B : Food and drinks are ridiculously expensive at the Night Safari and thus i would suggest to have your dinner in town first before heading there.
Once the park is open, you can try the 7:30pm night show if you have children or skip it totally as it's not really worth cajoling and queuing up for. DO NOT take the trams at this stage unless you want to waste another 30mins queuing up for it. Walk the trails starting with wallaby trail and aim for East Lodge rest stop.After that head back towards the main entrance via Leopard and Fishing Cat trails. The whole exercise will take you about 1.5hours. Then you take the trams at the mainstation. At this point of time, there should be no or minimal queues at the tram station. Take at least 2 rounds to see everything."
,,Experience the Night with sounds and sights of nocturnal animals.,4.0,,"One of the first in the world to feature a safe , night tour through the safari park on a train . Great for those who prefer to be ferried around to see animals roaming freely in their enclosure."
,,Extend your wildlife experience til midnight,5.0,,"If have nothing to do after visiting Singapore Zoo or River Safari, you might consider booking tickets to the Night Safari. It opens at 7:00 PM with Thumbuakar Fire show greeting you at the entrance. Show happens every hour then you can proceed to the Night Safari entrance. Same as with other tourist attractions, avoid weekends, public holidays & school holidays (May & November in Singapore). You would definitely enjoy the tram ride as it tours you around the attraction without you getting tired of walking around. But then again there are walking trails which you need to go through as the tram would not pass by to some enclosures like the jaguar's & the tiger's. And yes, the animals are so alive at night. To enjoy the experience, dress comfortably. Wear shorts, light shirt & sandals. Also bring mosquito repellant. As for food, there are food establishments outside the park but there are also some refreshment stalls inside. Your kids (& kid in you) will love it."
,,night trip,2.0,,Not recommended. The animals tend to hide/sleep. The day zoo is far better than this. Almost the same animals are displayed in the night safari.
,,Still a good night out for families,4.0,,"Great opportunity to see wildlife, albeit captive, during the hours of darkness when many are most active.

Very hot and humid during the night as would be expected but certainly worth a visit.

Be sure to check last train times ; it would be easy to miss the last train from Ang Mo Kio unless you plan ahead, and there is always a queue for the bus from the safari so you may not get on straight away.

Well worth visiting and an interesting experience."
,,Even better than expected,5.0,,"We went on Thursday night.A big thank you to Ade,the keeper on the fishing cat trail,he was knowledgeable and very helpful and really made our night with the animals he looks after..Saw lots of animals ,like a safari ,from the tram.good recorded commentary in English.was a good starting point. We booked our tickets online,timed entry, we were a bit late but it wasn't a problem.slight discount on line. We caught a taxi ,it cost $35 and took about 30mins from central Singapore , our friends had gone on public transport to the zoo a few days earlier and it took them 1.5 hours on the train and then bus each way.Is a cheaper option but .....
The food was pretty good at the food court area just outside the entry barriers, you can get a pass out of the park to eat and then re enter.
A really enjoyable night ,we finally left at 11.45pm .All the staff we encountered were charming."
,,A night at the zoo,5.0,,"A must do!! Do the show first and then jump on a tram for the full circuit. The walks are then worth it to see the animals up closer. Even though pretty busy, Singapore efficiency at its best. A highlight of the trip. Taxi was $30 Singapore from city."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"A safari around the animals by night in the land train and then a chance to walk around them. No tiny cages, mostly reasonable size enclosures separated by moats. Love the howling wolves and .bats"
,,Boring,1.0,,It's a normal zoo which they call safari. All the animals are under cage. You'll not feel that you are on a night life safari. Wastage of money. All the animals are trained.
,,Worth the effort to travel to mandai!,5.0,,Went with my family . Reached around 7.30 n we received help to board my wheel chair bound mother on the tram . We enjoyed the tram ride n seeing the animals in their natural habitat. It's a special way to spend your evening when you're in Singapore .
,,Great for the money but a big line at the start,4.0,,I was glad I did this and it's great for the family's. It's a great night safari with loads of animals. The trams around at night are great so u don't have to walk to much. I will defiantly return.
,,Honeymoon,5.0,,"Just been here tonight and it was fab, we booked on a tour but didn't have to stay together, definitely recommend a tour as you jump the queues for the open team rude and they pick you up and drop you off at your hotel. You get to see loads of amazing different animals, you definitely need to do the wallaby walk and the leopard walk. Food is good and the staff are very friendly and helpful, highly recommend"
,,Its good but expensive.,4.0,,Night safari is expensive and time consuming tourist attraction. You need to travel about 30 kms away from city. In addition you may a log que waiting for Night Safari. Would not strongly recommend though its good one.
,,"Incredible, seeing the animals at night is a whole new experience",5.0,,"Ever wonder what the wildlife does once the sun goes down, its a whole new experience. And they do get vocal which is just amazing. Short of a safari in Africa, nothing else comes close. We had researched tripadvisor and have been 3 times before over the last 20 years,, it just gets better and better. We took the MRT to Ang Mo Kio station and caught the 138 bus, arriving before 7 to purchase tickets. For our evening, my line was much shorter than the one for people who had prepaid online and were exchanging vouchers for tickets. Watch for which line to get into, they can't help you if you are in the wrong one.
I had read a lot of variations for the best way to plan the evening, we arrived at 6:45, they started letting the lines in at 7:15, and once we passed through the turnstiles the lines for the trams were already insane, and there were easily way more people behind us. We opted to do the 7:30 Nocturnal animals show, then walked the trails and when we returned to the trams- no line at all, just hopped on the next arriving tram- worked out perfectly. Love this Night Safari and have returned all 4 times we have been to Singapore. Beautifully laid out and fantastic staff at every turn."
,,So interested,5.0,,U can see many animals here at night in the jungle. The feeling when u see them in night very interesting .
,,Essential tourist material,5.0,,"The only problem here is that there is not enough time to enjoy it all! Get there early (first tickets are 7.30pm) and stay late. After the tram ride, walk around and see the animals at your own speed. The tiger may be a bit shy but, wow!"
,,A DELIGHT AT NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"This was a great chance to see animals at night as a lot of them are nocturnal.The
Night Safari was very well coordinated & great care was taken to not frighten them
as well as keep the visitors also safe.The viewing at night adds a special dimension
to watching animals.On top of this a 30minute ""school lesson"" from some of the handlers
of some of the tamer animals went down well."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The Singapore Night Safari is a great experience. The surroundings a very natural and it is great to see the nocturnal animals in an almost natural environment. If you have time make a day of it by going to the Day Zoo first then have dinner at the Zoo before going to the Night Safari
,,Loved it!,4.0,,"I booked a private tour in advance through Viator. The driver and guide picked us up from our hotel on time and gave us a very informative tour of singapore as we drove to the night safari. The guide was very knowledgeable and friendly and organised - she even brought snacks! We didn't have to wait in any lines once we got to the safari and got straight onto the tram. It is very dark and limited lights to avoid disturbing the animals so it can take some time to spot them but we were able to see all of the animals and take some great photos. The guide gave us lots of info on the animals and took us onto the walking tour. The walking tour was great and we did it at our own pace. Once we finished, we asked the guide for dinner suggestions in the city and she dropped us off at a really cool restaurant. Overall it was a great experience. Definitely recommend booking In advance."
,,Wow. Amazing evening.,5.0,,"We have now visited the zoo twice. It is a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend an evening, fantastic organisation and well worth the visit. Fantastic animals, the train around the zoo is well run and great for all ages."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Mostly it will suits the best for kids, the challenge would be spending time in the evening for 5 hours including transfers. May be not worth for singles. The good part is educational voice tour guide. forest lovers will love it."
,,The best Zoo ever visited!,5.0,,"I have been to many zoos but haven't seen anything like this one!!

While all the other zoos have the animals enclosed in cages, you can hardly find cages in Singapore Zoo.
Even though this zoo occupies a huge space, efforts have been put by the management for its excellent maintenance & hygiene facts.

People of all ages will enjoy this beautiful place as its well equipped will all the amenities required for people of different age groups.

They have a Tram service which will drop you to different spots. Once you have the tram tickets you can have unlimited trips.

The most amazing feature and highlight of the Singapore Zoo is the Night Safari! With animals as close as within 100 metres without any barricades or cages, is just a mind blowing experience!

Your Night Safari begins with a breath taking fire show put forth by the fierce & bold macho men.

Obviously a Top 5 item in your Singapore checklist."
,,The zoo came alive in the night,4.0,,This is totally different from the normal zoo next door. It is well cater to the night life party animals Roaming freely in the park. Is must to reach at the stated time as you can hop on to the tram which it will bring you around in the dark. During Oct. They might have Halloween party with the animals. But please check with the zoo for more information.
,,An experience!,4.0,,"Night safari is an experience in itself, if you have not done this ever before. The aura of the night spreads across and safari feels charming. Don't keep high hopes of spotting big cats though other animals are found in plenty at the time you take a tour from there. Kids would love it and remember it, so a must check itinerary. The staff is very friendly, professional and systematic. If you have booked the tickets online, you still have to line up at the counter to get a time slot on your tickets, based on which you'll be given entry to the safari ride. So the moment you reach the point, get queued up without wasting a moment."
,,A chaotic excursion,3.0,,"This was part of our double tour, with River safari in the morning and a few hours in between then Night safari. There were crowds of people, on a rainy night with limited shelter. No guide could be found so we did the tour on our own. Very long cues to get a seat on the safari tractor train. Despite dozens or pleas from the operators, people using flash photography spoiled the night vision and continually stunned the animals quietly grazing."
,,Fantastic experience,4.0,,"The night safari let us feel part of the Nature . The Animal was very close to us , the guide let us understand the way how They creat this well drived leisure park ! If you pass by Singapore it is must to visit"
,,Interesting experience,4.0,,This was an interesting experience viewing the animals at night time. Lots happening at the zoo with a fire show & animal talk. would like to see the zoo by day
,,On tour,3.0,,"Guide was good value and the only way to go as the ques or all the other public was massive and we got to walk straight into show, then tram ride. Place was very busy even so we caught up to other trams to a complete stop. Wasn't a lot to see for adults but 4 and 6 year old looked it. Didn't have time to walk the trails after the ride. As usual prices are tourist driven. Wouldn't put it high and list."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"It is impossible to recommend this attraction enough. The only thing we did was to go on the train tour. Sadly, we waited about an hour to get on it. However, once on board, this attraction did not disappoint. You are literally right next to the animals, it is amazing!"
,,Superb Experience!!,5.0,,"This is a place, which will bring you close to the wild animal species. You have to buy a ticket to get on to an open mini-train that chugs along slowly around the enclosures of various animals. You get to see lion packs, tigers, wild boars, cheetah, bison and much more. Please note: Photography with FLASH CAMERAS are strictly not permitted and you will be fined heavily if caught. Visited in the year 2010 (not in the dropdown)."
,,Great night with the kids,5.0,,"We went at 21:00 hrs because of a discounted ticket. But fireshow at entrance still there and after we went in we chose to walk the wallaby trail first. Great because they do the feeding around that time for some furry friends. We tried to do all 4 walking trails before the show at 22:30 but missed out the loop to the leopard which we did later during the safaritour. Show is now too boring when no more trained animals perform. Which is a good thing in itself. The safari is ok, lots of big animals. And we hopped out at the far east lodge to do the leopard loop. We ended night at 24:00 hr!"
,,"A repeat of the Zoo at night, with longer wait times, bland show, and less animals",2.0,,"I was there on 11/09/2016. I purchased the Night Safari as a package with the 3 other parks (Zoo, Bird Park, River Safari).

Problems:
1) The biggest problem with the Night Safari is that many of the animals (80%+) are repeated from the Zoo. The same facts and display boards are repeated again here. You don't learn too many new things.

2) The animals are hard to spot in the exhibit and I think there are better technological ways of showcasing the animals (infrared, multiple camera angles, more red lighting). What's the point if you can't even tell if the animal is there? A lot of animals didn't seem to be there.

3) Wait times. Long lines to get in. Long lines for the tram. Long lines for the show. I spent about 1.25 hours out of 3.5 hrs waiting in lines. Ouch.

4) Inclement weather procedures. It started raining pretty hard which caused the 9:30 show to be cancelled. For a place that only has one show, it's very disappointing there isn't a way to avoid rain cancellations in a tropical country. An overhead cover like the Zoo or Bird Park perhaps? I think blaming cancellation on rain is just a lack of motivation to get a solution and provide a good experience.

Then the 10:30 show was delayed by 15 minutes even though the rain had completely stopped at 9:40. Still they said the inclement weather had their hands tied. Was this the first time it had ever rained in Singapore? I know it doesn't sound like much, but considering that the shows are occasionally full (8:30 was full) and that you have to come early by 15-10 minutes to get a spot in line, it adds up. The park is open for half a long as a normal park (4.5 hours vs. 9).

When there was lightning, workers were sent to warn people off the trails and back to the main area. This lightning was quite far away, minimal, and scattered (15 minutes). However, the workers were pushy if you were on the trail. They didn't give you an option to stay, unless you insisted you wanted to keep on the trail. As a result, the majority of guests on the trail were unnecessarily turned back (I stuck around when I saw other guests still on the trail). Also, the park is full of tall metallic light posts and trees, so I think the fear of a lightning strike on a person is very very overblown; it is certainly no flat golf course.

5) The Show. There is only one show ""Creatures of the Night"". It repeats elements of other shows from the Zoo and Bird Park (yes the snake skin is dry, yes owls can turn their head 270 degrees). Let's invite someone who is scared of snakes to hold the giant python (yaaawwwwn). Let's see how the otter can teach us to recycle (ZzzzzZzzz). The kids seemed into it. But it felt forced (are you guys excited? yessss. I can't hear you... YESSSSS, get on with it already!!!!). Mostly animals appear on stage for 30 seconds and then walk off stage. The asian bear cat was the most interesting animal, because it can jump quite high 2-3 meters.

The Good
1) Night time walking trails. Spooky feeling. Lots of trees. Fun. The Malayan Flying Fox walkthrough was interesting because you could get close. Same with the wallabies.

Overall: Do the Zoo and Bird Park. They are way better. Spend your time at the Gardens by the Bay or Universal Studios. This was too much hassle with too little reward."
,,Good....but not great.,3.0,,"The Night Safari is certainly an experience. We caught the MRT on the red line to Ang Mo Kio then by bus to the safari. It was easy to get there....but a taxi might be quicker!
Once there you line up to get in....then you join a massive queue to catch a tram. The tram is worth doing.....but next time I'd skip it at the start and just head out on the trails.
Whilst on the tram you see animals whilst listening to a pre-recorded voice over. The thing I couldn't get past was that the whole thing felt a bit like Jurassic Park where they try to lure the T-Rex out with the goat. All the animals seemed to be waiting for food or had just been fed. It just lacked a ""natural"" feel and felt forced.
Once off the tram we walked two of the trails....the otters were putting on a show which became the highlight.
The transport to and from the venue is really well organised. We considered waiting to catch the bus home....but it was late and we were tired so we opted to catch a taxi instead.
Overall the Night Safari was enjoyable.....but could be even better."
,,"Nice Ride, But Lot's of Queueing",3.0,,"We arrived around 7.20pm and the 8.15pm show was sold out, so we bought tickets for the 9.15pm show. Queued for about 30 minutes for tickets, and were then told to join the queue for our show immediately. We then queued for another 90 minutes and boarded our tram at exactly 9.15pm. The ride was good, lasts around 35 minutes and you do see many animals. you can disembark at various stations and go on walking trails but we didn't do this. there was another show we could go to when we came out, but as we hadn't had dinner, we chose to eat instead. We had curry and it was very good and reasonably priced. All in all an ok night out."
,,Check the weather forecast before visiting,3.0,,"Seeing the animals up close at night is a great experience, though we were unfortunate that we visited when the weather was bad, and we ended up stuck on the tram due to a fallen tree. Not entirely the safari's fault, but we thought the crisis management could be better.

Make sure you check the weather forecast before visiting this place as the experience is weather dependent.

The food here is also extremely expensive, so do make sure to eat dinner first outside before visiting."
,,Manic waste of time,2.0,,"Took tour with Viator and was incredibly rushed from dinner, train ride and only saw 1 of the 2 night shows. No time for the fire twirling show. Only saw the pathetic short animal show."
,,Fun Experience!,4.0,,"The Night Safari was very fun! I went with my family while on vacation at Singapore and it was hit among us. It was a very unique experience. I will, however, say that I was disappointed in the safari ride. All that they drove by were deer and possibly a few lions or elephants. I wasn't to happy to see deer because I can see them where I live so it wasn't so unique to me. I do highly suggest walking around the park though. The ride does not give justice to the park and if you just go on the ride and leave, you are missing out. There are do many cute animals that you can see while walking and if your lucky a lion may roar or a hyena may bark. I found it to be a real cool experience that I haven't experienced anywhere else!"
,,see animal in their night modus,3.0,,It was interesting to see how the animals behave when it is night. To walk past their shelters and see them doing their own thing when it is dark.
,,Night safari,1.0,,"I wouldn't recommend this. Too expensive , bought our tickets on line and arrived 15 minutes early as suggested . Then waited an hour to get to tram soooo many people waiting. The tram does stop along the the way for you to hop off if you wish , they come past about every 20 minutes. I think the trams go way too fast for you to see anything, especially if there is animals on both sides of road. I would think going later in the afternoon would be much better, and take your time . Disappointed."
,,Great evening out of the city,5.0,,"We didn't know what to expect with this but it was worth the visit. We arrived about 6:45pm, I wouldn't advise arriving any later because the queues for the trams grew very quickly after we arrived. We got on the 7:30pm tram which took us around the park. We saw lots of animals up close, elephants, lions, giraffes etc. The guy driving the tram was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. We did all of the walking tours after the tram ride (took about half an hour) and then saw the fire eating display which was very impressive. We combined this trip as part of the city sightseeing bus tours 3 trip offer- I think this was the best way to do it as we were left to our own devices and didn't have to hang around for the tour bus to leave at the end of the night. The city sightseeing bus company operated a number of buses from 9:20pm from the safari back into Singapore which let us hop on the most convenient one."
,,Very well set up,5.0,,The night Safari is a great evening out. It's well set up so you can see all the animals easily. I recommend to do the trails first and tram last to avoid the long queues early on. If you have kids it's a big night so they will definitely need a sleep in the day to last. It takes about 3-4 hours.
,,Just wonderful,5.0,,I heard not so good things about this place. But i liked this place. The tram ride was amazing. The group of Hayenas were looking so strong and live.
,,Complete waste of time and money,2.0,,"We arrived at 7pm, the 7.15pm tram was fill so got a ticket for the 8.15 tram. Had good burger at Bongo Burgers then had to join the first queue at 7.45. Ok show with fire eating (little did we know this would be a highlight!!!) The queue moved quickly at 8.15 for 5 minutes THEN we queued for ONE HOUR (I kid you not) We asked if it was busy and slow because it was Saturday night but the official said no, it was always busy and slow like this!!!!!) We got on the tram at 9.15 and we're off again 9.50 so not even 40 minutes. We had to rush to catch the bus back to town, so didn't have time to do any of the walks! The actual tram trip didn't make up for the disappointment of the organisation with the trams. I saw trams leaving not full. The organisation was terrible. They obviously want you to pay the higher fees to get a quicker trip. But that is dreadful! Would not recommend this to anyone. Come to Christchurch and see Orana Park....200 times better!"
,,Worth doing but don't expect the best,4.0,,"The Night Safari is a brilliant and well executed attraction except for a couple of things. With it being at night, some of the animals are hard to see and also like to sleep when the sun isn't shining. There are animals that were awake and were very striking, the White Lion and the rhino to mentions couple. Also there was a number of different species of deer, which in the dark all looked very very similar but great to see up close.
The staff were great and very happy and smiley, making my children smile too but they had a difficult time seeing the animals. I don't think they were disappointed but after doing the zoo in the morning I think they expected more."
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Absolutely loved the Night Safari, we walked instead on catching the tram and it was well worth it. We were able to get up close to many animals. Truly a wonderful experience and the highlight of our trip"
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"It's a complete waste of time and money, the animals are usually asleep by the time you pass by and you don't get to see or hear anything. They put you on a bus that goes around the park and ends within 20min, that's it!
Was very disappointed."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Negative things

- The "" Creatures of the Night Show"" show was bad. First 10mins was spent telling people to turn off there flash on there cameras, and obviously some people promptly did the exact opposite. Lots of shouting over microphones.Which kind of ruins the atmosphere of the night safari. The loudness was very OTT. Something a bit more in keeping with the idea of the night and the nature of nocturnal animals would have been better.

Positive things

+ Lots and lots of animals to see, almost too much in one night.
+ Jump on a small train, travel to a close by area which then has a walking route that you can do to see different nocternal animals.
+ Highlights for me include the fruit bat enclosure. Which literally has bats flying around you.
+ Super atmospheric, glad we went.

Overall fantastic, the Creatures of the Night Show needs some tweaking. The animals where great but the delivery of the show needs a bit nuance. Everything else was brilliant."
,,Animals Roam Wild,5.0,,"This is an ideal zoo because animals roam in the wild, and people who visit are the ones in the enclosure. I got to see lots of animals up close. This is a must in Singapore!"
,,Great night,5.0,,Really enjoy fire show and creatures of the night show. Totally different to a normal zoo. Kids 5/7 loved it
,,This is my second time,5.0,,"I visited this Safari alone in 2011 and it was incredible, and this time I visited with my lovely wife. For her it was amazing but for me not because all shows were as same as 2011. They have been repeating the show since 2011. So if you have visited, I don't recommend it."
,,Premium Adventure Tour is the only way to go!,5.0,,"Visited as part of our honeymoon. We had booked the Premium Adventurer Tour which I cannot recommend enough.

The standard tour involves loads of people in a tram and you're round the park and back in 40mins. You don't stop at any time for a closer look or to shake hands with some creatures.

The Premium tour starts with a full buffet dinner which was great. Your own personal tour guide (ours was Walter who's knowledge is second to none!) meets up at the restaurant where you are taken to the creatures of the night show. I have to say we felt like some sort of celebs as you are taken to the very front of the queue and have reserved seats at the front! There are thousands of people around so the queues are insane!

Following that you are taken to your own buggy where you have roughly 2 hours in the park with your tour guide.

The addition to this package is that you get to personally feed the elephants. This was an experience I will never forget.

Yes the premium package is expensive but if you're going to do the tour, then you should do it right.

I would go back in a heart beat."
,,A Night at the Singapore Night Safari,5.0,,"When you arrive at Night Safari, part of the same wildlife reserve as the Singapore Zoo, you’ll hop aboard an open-air tram to travel through the 98-acre (40-hectare) jungle park, subtly illuminated to highlight the exciting nocturnal atmosphere in which the resident animals come alive. On the tram, pass by a large reservoir, and journey through habitats specially designed to simulate the natural environments of the wildlife, from the rainforest of Southeast Asia to the Indian subcontinent to the foothills of the Himalayas. Then take a walk along a safari trail with a guide, who helps you spot big cats like Sri Lankan leopards and a Gir lion. Stroll down the East Lodge Trail to watch for a Malayan tiger, spotted hyenas and red river hogs, and check out the Wallaby Trail to look for wildlife that’s native to Australia. Your admission to Night Safari includes access to two shows, described below. When booking this tour, you also have the option to include dinner; see below for more details. Thumbuakar Performance: Watch a performance of cultural dance moves from an enthusiastic troupe of Thumbuakar warriors. You’ll be amazed by their rhythm, fire-eating tricks, flame-throwing demonstrations and unbelievable stunts. Creatures of the Night show: Journey into the rainforest during this 20-minute interactive show that highlights the behaviors and skills of nocturnal animals like the civit, binturong, otter and more. Be wowed by the powerful jaws of a spotted hyena, and watch the African serval display its ability to leap for prey. Optional buffet dinner upgrade: Enhance your time at the Night Safari with dinner at Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant, a 600-seat eatery with an array of local cuisine and international dishes. Enjoy the rustic-elegant setting, whether inside with its wooden accents and rattan fans or outside where you can listen to the sounds of cicadas, frogs and other nighttime creatures while Ankole cattle graze nearby.

Amazing. Awesome. Outstanding.
A very unique experience that you have to do if you go to Singapore.
Did the tram which was awesome. The announcer is kind of lame and monotonous, but the sights are great. All the animals are active and super close to you as you ride by.
Also did the Creatures of the Night show, which is also awesome. Very funny and enjoyable.
There was also some kind of fire dancing show going on in the main area with the shops and stuff that was great to watch for a bit too.
This is a must do. Period.

The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore.

,,Unusual experience,3.0,,"Take a tour for this adventure this avoids the lengthy queues at park entrance and payment kiosks. There are a couple of shows to watch at various times and good fun with interesting facts. The train ride with recorded information is provided whilst you travel around and there s always the option of a walking trail for the most adventurous. Kids will be thrilled however please bare in mind the animals are not always visible so this may lead to little o Es being disappointed . Ate at the tandoori restaurant after and food was delicious, set meals available chicken tikka naan bread poppadums very tasty."
,,Night tram with priority pass,4.0,,This was nice to see but very short and animals are asleep most of the time. Nice activity and they are doing great work Ito creating a natural habitat and awareness.
,,Visit,5.0,,Brilliant worth staying to see .animals looked brilliant against the night sky went on train as been at zoo all day
,,Night owls.,5.0,,"Once again just like the zoo, wonderful! We chose the tram ride as our little legs were worn out due to the zoo visit but it didn't distract 1 bit from the place. Let the rush go and then enjoy. Don't use flash photography as the guides can be quite forceful in their warnings, rightly so."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,"Singapore zoo is world class and worth the visit during the day, but the night Safari is a whole other beast (pardon the pun).

You will see some amazing animals during the tour which are all fairly active being that they are mostly nocturnal. The showstopper is their male elephant, which blew my mind the first time I saw it.

You spend time on a vehicle which drives through the habitats, and you also have several opportunities to get off the tram and walk the trails which house a host of different creatures you could easily miss if you didn't bother. You could spend hours alternating between the two and it is certainly worth taking the time.

Do no fall into the trap of ""we've seen the zoo during the day, how much more could there be?"" Because the variety and experience of the night zoo is worth every penny.

I have done both the tour and solo and in my opinion it is worth making a night of it with the tour group. You will get a nice buffet meal at one of the restaurants, priority access to the vehicle, and a guide who (for us) was fantastic and very knowledgeable in regards to the animals.

Do not leave Singapore without visiting the night safari.

And please don't be the fool who uses their camera's flash despite the warnings against it. In fact, forget your camera. They don't work well at night anyway and you'll miss the majesty of the animals if you're looking through a lens."
,,Skip the meal,4.0,,"Enjoyable and yes the animals are out and about including the King of the jungle. While I did the tour with dinner I suggest skip the dinner so you can do the walking treks. Great set up and well organised, then again it is Singapore the champions of logistics."
,,Wasn't sure but turned out great,4.0,,"What an unusual experience, I would not had thought walking around a zoo would be so much in than doing it at night, when you'd think most animals are asleep. But no there are plenty of animals that are still awake during the night as they are during the day time.

You do feel a bit like your putting them out cos it is night time but you soon realise if they want to sleep then they do go to the place that they can.

Cool night activity for I'd say adults wanting to do something different."
,,Interesting view of a few selected animals at night,4.0,,its unusual being a night safari where animals can be viewed under lights. A good experience if you have extra time. Its very crowded and variety of animals is very limited
,,Something Different!,5.0,,"Another must do activity as you probably won't get a chance to see another (controlled) zoo at night. Got there by metro and then bus with minimal waiting time but do be aware of the last bus/train back to where ever it is you need to go otherwise it's taxi. There are plenty of animals on view and even though it is dark you get to see them in a different light (no pun intended). It also adds to the mystery of the adventure. Some night animals like the Bats come to life in the dark which makes things interesting especially if you are a paranoid arachnophobe!
There is a tour on a shuttle with the best Chinese-English descriptive language I have witnessed and worth the payment alone! you can then hop off and walk the around the zoo to see the animals (some behind a glass wall of course) in their habitat. I must say though the tiger was somewhat strange as it kept walking the same steps for a good 10-15 minutes before we moved on!
Great to see, Brilliant for Kids of course and an experience to remember. oh and there is a Baskin and Robbins if that's what floats your boat."
,,Day Safari much better,3.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and went to the night safari one evening, there are long ques when you get there and many thousands of visitors all waiting for the tram cars that take you round. You dont see that many animals from the tram car and need to get off to walk the trails which some areas are very dark and long walks. The food is very expensive and not very good. Take a tip and go on the day safari it is much better and you see a lot more, and more things to do especially for the kids."
,,Good experience.,3.0,,"We visited this place on a pre-arranged tour. Do not try to walk-in if you do not want to queue for hours. Eat first before heading to this place. This place is far from the city, its about an hour drive. And because its night safari they get busy at 7pm and your entire tour will probably finish by 12 midnight.

There were 5,000 people in the park all at the same time according to our tour guide. We had buffet dinner in one of the restaurants(part of the pre-arranged tour) before hopping on the buggy train that showed us around. Thankfully we got a pre-arranged tour on here otherwise we would have queued like crazy.

Animals were not caged but surprisingly they stayed where they are. If you want to enjoy the entire safari you're gonna have to take the trail, meaning you walk on foot so u can see more of their animals. Some areas were really dark so its hard to see the animals. In some areas, the buggy drives fast, i think to catch up with the new crowd waiting. After the safari we watched the animal show. The animal show is not a circus show, so don't expect any lions or tigers jumping in hoops.

There are also fire dancers, but in other Asian and African countries we take fire dancing
seriously. I was a bit disappointed to see the fire dance was not fire dance at all. Poor guys just blowing alcohol to create fire.

Nevertheless, it was a nice experience. Make sure that if u have kids to pre-arrange your tour or to avoid visiting on weekends and holidays."
,,Different and worth a visit,4.0,,"The night Safari is a different experience to the ordinary zoo trip and well worth a trip. We booked for the 8.15pm entry and had to stand in a queue to be let in. Alongside the queue was the fire eaters show and they didn't let us in until that had ended. Being small I couldn't see anything of the show but thought I'd be able to go to the next one. If there was one then it wasn't advertised which it seems a bit unfair for everyone on the 8.15,9.15 and 10.15 shows as we'd all paid the same. One of the reasons we chose the 8.15 was that it had far more tickets available than the 7.15 making it less busy and I also hoped to avoid lots of young children, in particular I was trying to avoid pushchairs. This worked to some extent but you still still get some people bringing out very young children late at night. The night show is worth attending as the keepers bring out animals to show you and explain about them. They ask that you don't use the flash on your camera. He explained that it damages the animals eyes as well as scaring them. He repeated this in at least 5 languages but there were still ignorant people using a flash!. If you go to the show first then there isn't such a large queue for the trams as everyone races to these when they open the doors. The tram ride is excellent with great views and good informative commentary. We saw tigers moving about whereas in the daytime they always just lie still. The baby elephant was especially adorable. At the end of the tram ride you can walk up some of the trails to see additional animals. I recommend you see the leopard which was patrolling his large enclosure and we got great views. Although they say you can hop on and off the tram in reality you can only do this at a couple of stops and even at night it's still hot so plan your route. I suggest you use your insect repellent but the biting insects were no where near as bad as I expected. The ice cream sold at the entrance/exit is excellent but pricey! Price wise I think the entrance fee is a bit expensive but hopefully this goes towards the care of the animals so I don't mind. Our only negative experience was the taxi back which wasn't the zoo's fault. The taxi we got in didn't have a working middle seat belt in the back and the driver didn't want to stop and let us get out to get another taxi. Eventually he turned round when we insisted for the 3rd or 4th time and said it wasn't safe. He then tried to charge us even though we'd told him before he set off that the belt didn't work. He knew there was no socket to clip it into but just kept driving. When we did get out he shouted abuse at us as he drove off as he was then at the back of the queue. So if 3 of you need to be in the back check the seat belts before you close the car doors! Otherwise this was a great trip."
,,Overhyped,2.0,,"This is not the place you would like to visit as it may yield in just time wastage better to go for other much better attractions. I had been here but couldn't find anything special, long waiting que and at the end when you finally make to cab there is no surety of watching night safari."
,,Fun place,3.0,,However not fun when you stand waiting a hour for them to feed the lions and then told it's not 8 pm as the map and signs say but only on Fridays and Saturdays or public holidays they feed them ( in fine print ) They do have hundreds of animals. You have to walk the trails and then you will see them unlike some reviewers stated. The ticket of 45 Singapore dollars is expensive for the adventure. The food is very expensive and not good quality.
,,Great!,5.0,,"We enjoyed the unique experience of the N right Safari. It was nice to be able to walk around in the paths and also take the tram. It is amazing how the animals stay in their designated area though there is no visible barrier. The availability of refreshments and the fire show while waiting for admission works well. I was disappointed that at the concession which has frozen root beer slush and ice cream (separately) that the staff is unable to offer a root beer float at any price. That would have been a nice treat. Important to note that the Zoo is pretty far out of the city so we took 3 buses to get there and over an hour. That said, it was quite inexpensive to take the bus. The bus stopped running by the time we left the Zoo so we took an Uber home for about $50."
,,Night zoo,2.0,,"If going to night zoo book a bus deal as queues are so long, with tour get priority boarding no waiting. Kids loved it adults mayby not so great."
,,Night safari world class,4.0,,"Amazing to see the night life of the animals. Not just minimal and boring exhibits. African lion, elephants, hyena and rhino are great
Safe tram rides and walk options available. Could be closed on heavy rain. Tickets distributed around 5.30 pm and the show starts 7.15 pm onwards...first come first serve basis...could form a long queue on a busy day
Food and drink options available.
Very close to Singapore zoo..actually you could cover both on a single day
Low light camera recommended"
,,"Horrible food, horrible tour",1.0,,"We were on our honeymoon and had made this one of the major things we planned to do . we were very excited about the night but ended up bitterly disappointed and a found it a great waste of money and time.
The food was dry and almost uneatable. Think it was left over from the previous night. I think 2 people at the table went away NOT hungry.
The place was so packed that we were pushed through like sheep, so glad we didn't go in as individuals as they had to wait twice as long to get into the night safari train.
As we drove through the animals the tour guide sat on her phone and made no connection with us at all. The driver actually drove by the some of the animals and we had to ask him to stop so we could actually see them. Which seemed to be an effort on his part.While the deer seemed fairly happy the rest just look miserable.
The animals themselves were in small enclosures (as they advertise not behind bars) but fenced in by natural obstacles such as ditches . Good luck if you got to see 1 move. The elephant had such as small area I wondered if he could move even if he wanted to
If you give me a free ticket I would go back."
,,OK,3.0,,"You have the option of booking this attraction online and also select the slot/timings of your choice.
The way it sounds convenient and organised while doing it online..it is not the case when you reach over there.
They take approx 250-300 bookings for one slot and it is not just 250-300 people but that many families.
Once we are allowed inside as per the slots the crowd stands in disorganised queues.
People just scramble here and there cluelessly.
When finally the gates are open to the tram station people go berserk by pushing each other ignoring senior citizens and children.
This is one thing the park should seriously think about to avoid and any untoward incident.
The best thing would be to put barricades and arrange proper queues.
Also there should be a person to manage the queues"
,,Arrive early,4.0,,"Go early especially at weekends. We didn't get there until 7:30pm and by then couldn't get in until 9:15 which doesn't leave much time to see quite a lot. Definitely take the bus around the park, sometimes you get very close to the animals. There is a return bus to and from the city centre that's good value for money but didn't tell us till we got there that the last 2 busses wouldn't run and we had to leave disappointingly by 11:00.
It is an interesting experience, although I do wonder how they get the animals to be in the right place each night? If time is pressing unless you have children you could skip the show and spend the same time on one of the trails. It's expensive but I felt worthwhile."
,,Very good and memorable experience,5.0,,"Really funtastic place to visit. Very good for kids from 8 plus age. Mini train is available to move around and if you wish trails (walking space) is also available. Best is to download maps and all info from website and plan your trip well in advance. Booking is also available on online. Singapore pass is very hand however your need at least 7days to completely use ultimate pass.
Night safari must see attrraction"
,,Really worth the visit,4.0,,"We enjoyed the night safari, it was busy but well organised. We were bused in and shown where to go, there are options of what to see and also the ride around the park seeing the animals in a semi natural habitat. This was impressive and enjoyed by us all. Some attractions get ver busy, plan which you want to do and in what order. I would recommend this trip."
,,Not a delightful night,2.0,,The train ride through the zoo at the evening was one of the worst experiences I have had in a zoo. It was so rehersed and booring difficult to see the animals difficult to put up with others taking photos with a flash when they were told not to. Definatly not value for money at all
,,Singapore zoo in the dark= night safari,3.0,,"We went to the bird park Singapore zoo and then came to the night safari.
The fire show every1s been talking about is good no doubt abt that but it's too crowded. When u join the queue keep left if you want the best view of the fire show. Then u enter inside a and join another queue for the tram. The queue is fast moving but it's loooonnngggg. Ok so we were tired already standing the queue and we went in the tram. 40-45 mins ride. It's cool. But it was like I saw the Singapore zoo in sunlight and I saw it again in the dark haha. It's kinda okay.. we took 3 in 1 park hopper pass.. so we used it well.. covered all the places.. not bad but nothing grt."
,,Deception,1.0,,"We were a group of 4 and had big expectations. Night safari sounds exciting, right?
The tickets were quite expensive so we were convinced that this would be an experience to remember.

We arrived and had to queue for some minutes. We were then guided to a kids train that takes you through the ""jungle"". We knew it was a night safari but there were no lights anywhere - in 99% of the stops we saw no animals, it was completely dark! At one point we could get out of the train and continue the tour by walk, which was a good choice as we were able to see a few animals at least.

We felt cheated and deceived. Not an excursion we would recommend at all. It's probably better to go during the day."
,,A must do for animal lovers,5.0,,"The first thing to do is book in advance (1 to make sure you get a ticket and 2 to get a discount - we saved 10%). It's really easy to get public transport to the zoo from downtown Singapore just make sure you have some change for the bus from Ang Mo Kio. It does get really busy so if you want it to be quieter you should book the latest tickets available (which are 10.15pm)

It was really different to see the animals roaming around at night, and I'd recommend that you don't do the tram for the first 2 stops, as it's nicer (and a lot quieter to walk around). The fruit bat cave was brilliant, and it felt more of an adventure having to keep your eyes peeled for the animals.

We also had the bonus of a quick look round the river safari, part of which was open to night safari guests."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"It was a whole new experience to do this safari. I suggest if you have not done this elsewhere, this is the place to try. Though a night safari, it is lit enough. Smaller kids may get frightened though as howls and cries from some animals can be rattling."
,,Dont do it on a Sat Night,3.0,,"A terrible experience, spent most time in never ending ques like sheep/cattle being herded along into never ending smaller lanes.
Once on the ""Train"" we were terribly disappointed, the animals are hard to see. I wouldnt do it again. I think a daytime visit would be a better bet."
,,"Good evening out, especially for the kids...",3.0,,"We visited the Night Safari recently and had a good evening. Friends had recommended to go slightly later than your allotted time slot to avoid standing in line to enter - we did just that (whilst having a quick drink in the bar next to the entrance line) and I would definitely recommend it. The line disappeared minutes from the opening time and we strolled in.

I would also suggest that you take the option to not jump straight on the tram (again, long lines at the first stop) but walk on a little bit and then pick it up. There is definitely more to see from the tram and the commentary is good - but you can spend time in line getting hot and sweaty waiting to get on it at the first stop.

Overall we had a good evening. The attraction is ideal for school children – plenty to see, informative, interactive show etc. The park is small enough that you can walk round easily to see everything and/or do another lap on the tram.

Worthwhile visiting."
,,Unique! Must do w/ Family in Singapore!,5.0,,"This should be an automatic ""Go Do"" when in Singapore, especially if on vacation with the family. Only Nocturnal Zoo (so they said) in the world. Not only do you get to see animals you would not normally see during daylight hours in a regular zoo, but all of the animals were very active! Make sure you walk the four trails as that is the best way to see some of the animals up close and for as long as you like. Plus, there are areas to walk through where the animals (Wallaby area, Monkey area, Bat Area) are running free all around you! Plus, how often are there great kid friendly sights to see at night when on vacation? This place was wonderful! If you buy over the internet, cheaper prices. There are set times to enter and you should make reservations ahead of time. Everyone runs straight to the trams and they end up waiting half an hour at least in line. Skip this and start walking the trails instead. You can go back to the tram stop at any time and there is no wait later!"
,,Worth the queuing,5.0,,"Expect a long wait to ride tram but worth it. If you've got more energy after riding, it is worth to walk around."
,,Must do in Singapore,4.0,,"must do if you are in Singapore, although the queues at the entrance are long, but if you book through a tour company, for a little extra charge you get to jump the long queues. it has a 40 minute tram ride taking you through the park but they do not stop any where, also has four walking trails which is a must to do if you want to get up and close to the animals. be sure to take you insect repellent with you. If you get the timing right you also get to see a great fire dance show, I think it is at 8:30 each night."
,,Night Safari @ Singapore,5.0,,"The Night Safari is excellent for tourists and locals alike. It is sort of a ""train ride"" within a controlled zoo-like environment. Highly recommended."
,,Amazing experience at the Night Safari,5.0,,Night Safari at Singapore is an exciting experience. It's a fascinating tram ride to have close encounter with animals. They have many shows which are really good. Highly recommended.
,,Very good attraction.,4.0,,"Night safari is another good attraction in Singapore. It is customized Safari similar to actual safarin in Africa region.
You can see all the animals during night via a vehicle which is either jeep or SUV like.
But one more thing if you have already seen Singapore Zoo then you might get bored to watch same animals but only during night.
Altough you must visit once if you are on tour.
Between Zoo and Night Safari I will recommend Night Safari!
Hope this helps."
,,Good close up look at the animals,3.0,,"We went with a tour. I highly recommend this, as it is very popular and the queues are huge. We queued for around 20-30 minutes, then got on the train/car carriage, we nearly didn't get on as a man rushed the queue and pushed us all out of the way, very rude! We did get a seat at the back so all was good. We drove around all the animals were right there standing in the light, a bit strange I thought, but you did get a good look at them. Once we finished the ride we could walk around freely, which was also good. Overall, it was a good experience."
,,Unusual experience to see animals at night,4.0,,"Worth doing even though it's not cheap. The food court at the entrance is also OK, we had a decent dinner there before visiting the night zoo."
,,Different experience,4.0,,"Animals are difficult to locate, but still we were able to spot them. It was a different experience. In the night safari food court was there for refreshments"
,,"Nice park but AVOID Isango, Funvee and most especially SAEX",3.0,,"Night safari is ok. But ISANGO, Funvee and SAEX suck. I booked for our party of four tickets to the Hop on Hop off + Night Safari through a website called Local Singapore Tours powered by ISANGO. The bus company they hired is called SAEX.

The bus picked us up at 6:10 pm and brought us to the ticket center where we had to wait for ten minutes before being picked up by another bus that went on to pick up other passengers. It was a long and annoying process and we got to the Night Safari well past 8pm. Along with the other passengers, we were a group of 7 (four of us, plus a group of 2, plus a solo traveller). The earliest available tram was 9:15. We were told that we could take the bus at three times, the latest being 11:00 pm.

We were at the bus stop at exactly 2 minutes before 11:00 pm, only to see the SAEX bus leave us, despite our frantic waving of arms and our entreaties for him to stay. We were then told by the men in the SAEX counter that it was the last bus, and there was no more coming. We told him that we were not late, we arrived exactly on time, and as paying customers, SAEX thus had a legal and contractual obligation to bring us to our destination. He said that there was no bus coming, and we had to pay 10 singapore dollars per head to take a van (which magically arrived, ready to drive us home for 10 dollars each, or 70 dollars total.). We are certain that he is also a SAEX employee because he was right inside the SAEX booth. I am not sure if the company and its partners know of what their employees are doing, but it ruined our trip and left a bad taste in our mouth.

Do avoid these companies: ISANGO, Funvee, SAEX."
,,Poor Management overly crowded,2.0,,"We (with three young children) bought the tickets for the 7pm entry and by the time we got there 6.45pm the crowds are massive. all waiting at the entrance to get in. Just before the gate open there was a fire show. Unfortunately people at the back of the crowds would not see anything especially children. When the gate open the crowds just rushed to get in and queue for the tram. We decided to walk as the queue at the tram is too long.
When we finished walk on the trails we go back to the tram queue and it is still very long (about 100 peoples waiting). The staffs suggested we go to the animal show and show us the way. When we got there (not surprise) another long queue to get in to the show!! We are stucked in between the long queue so we just move along with the queue and watch the show. We managed to get the seats on the far right corner and we only managed to see some of the show! Don't bother if you get the corner seat as you can't see much especially with young children. The show lasted about 20 minutes and we decided to try our luck on the tram. Unfortunately the next session of entry is open and more people are queuing for the tram. My daughter was crying as she wanted to try the tram but we have no choice but to leave as the queue is too long and I have a 2 years old with me as well and I am sure she is gets very frustrated waiting in the line for hours to get into the tram.
If you are travelling with young children please don't bother. Just go to the day zoo. Far more better and see the animals better."
,,""" A Hot Dark Night """,3.0,,"We arrived on the hop on hop off bus tour from Suntec City which took 45 mins on an open top bus. This was great as we saw the city at dusk and the breeze was nice as the temperature had gone up to 32 in the day.

On arrival it was packed. I mean ram jam packed with coaches, cars, taxi's everywhere. People not knowing where to go or who to follow. Luckily we had a great tour guide. Who went off into the dark and returned with tickets.

It was so busy that the 7pm and 8 pm tours had become fully booked. She told us that they had tried to put us on a 9.30 pm tour and this was at 6.50 pm. Luckily again she managed to get us all on 7.00 pm tour.

We then all went off to join a very long line, just like being at a Universal ride and get on a safari bus with about 50 others. Then off you go into the night.

Hot, dark and not a great deal to look at, it was Pot luck if you saw an animal in the right place at the right time just as you and 50 others just happened to be passing by.

Would I recommend this attraction.
Yes, but book with tour to make it easy.

Top Tip. If going with kids some mosquitos repellent would be a good idea, also keep an eye on them, it's so busy you can lose them really quickly."
,,Nothing interesting,3.0,,"I was surprised, this is my second visit to Night Safari. I recall they had exciting attraction while you ride the TRAM. This time, there was simply nothing exciting. The Creatures of the Night was nothing to be excited about. the animals didn't do much, they were just showcased to the audience and thats it. i recall years bacl there were tigers doing some tricks and mo nkeys doing tricks.

The Tram ride was a 40 minute
tour and it was basically just a simple tour seeing wild animals sleeping or resting.
there are nice souvenir shops and food is No big deal and really pricey. Meal would cost about 19 to 25sing dollars. normal lead time inside would be 2.5H to 3H, due to long wait in line."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Place was very crowdy , almost waited 3 hours in line for my ride but in the end it was worth it. All new zoo concept."
,,Excellent!!!!,5.0,,"The place was too crowdy. There was a fire show when we were waiting for our turn. Awesome show. Then we sat in a small electric cars which was open. It was 7 in the evening. I saw animals close to our cars. The were free not closed. They didn't harmed anybody. Tiger, lion, elephant and many more... A must visit"
,,Make sure u walk and ride,5.0,,"Alot of friends had said this is a must do in singapore, so high expectations were formed.

It did not disapoint.

We rode the tram to the first stop and got off as there are some interesting areas you need to get off to see for fruit bats etc. Then jumped back on tram to see the rest before seeing the creatures of the night show

Restaurants onsite were pretty good as well.

Advice would be to allow most of the night for this one. Getvthere about 7 and stay till late e.g. 11pm for last show. There is plenty to see"
,,One of its kind experience,4.0,,"If you love animals but at a distance, then this is the place you should visit. At the entrance you will be entertained by a mesmerizing fire show. Then a entertaining animal show followed by lots of trails and rides. Great opportunity to see nocturnal animals in their natural habitat. Definately much much better than seeing caged animals."
,,Visiting tamed and untamed animals,4.0,,Its a pleasure to watch the lions..elephants..giraffe...goats..cattle..antelopes and many such animals...some are endangered too... Its a tram ride with no flash photography allowed...there are some points where you can take a walk too. We move in the dark. Must visit.
,,Not the best,3.0,,"As it is a night safari we were hoping that there would be more lights to actually see the animals. We were able to spot few of them but for the kids the zoo was little bit darker than expected. We couldnt take photos as well especially that a flash is not allowed to be used. The family photo taken at the beginning was not actually taken so well (when adding the background) not so professional work.
However it was still a good experience!"
,,Always good times,4.0,,Hyenas are always my favorite! Great fun for families and friends. Worth visiting when in Singapore! Buy tickets online before going.
,,Night visit,1.0,,"Disappointed. We arrived late for our meal. Qued 15 to get food on plate. Beer was $1.30 glass wine $1.60 both totally overpriced. We were given 40 minutes all up to get our meal, eat, drink and toilet break. Rushed. Raced down to find fireworks finished so back the way we came to walk to zoo display where we saw 4 animals. Told in 5 different languages not to use flash on our cameras! This took longer than the show. Then run back to coach! All this for $95. Refund required here. Cannot recommend this company or trip."
,,"The best way to see animals in captivity, a must!",5.0,,"Booked online and on the day I requested an earlier safari as my son had been unwell the night before, without any issue we were rescheduled and instructed to see the information desk to amend the passes. We duly arrived, told the guest service member about the change and immediately escorted past the queues and after 15 minutes queuing we were on the tram. We thought it would be good but it exceeded expectations, the animals in their as close to natural habitat as possible, the commentary that was not just informative but educational. I was surprised at the amount of people visiting the zoo in the evening but it seemed to work like a well oiled machine. Its some distance from the city centre but there are regular buses and numerous taxi's to take you to/from the safari."
,,Love the park!,5.0,,"We completely enjoyed our time at the Night safari park. The fire throwers show as you enter the park, the night animals show and the tram ride were all very enjoyable. Tip: avoid combining the Night safari with the zoo as it makes for a very long and tiring day."
,,Very good,5.0,,Teaches you at the entrance about all the animals in cruelty at the moment but as you go into the safari it really makes you realise that zoos aren't just about animals trapped in cages. It's about you paying so they get the health and food they need. Very good! Lots of cafes and shops
,,What night safari?!,1.0,,"It took us well over 2 hours to get to the night safari and back for a 15-minute show and a 35-minute trail on a tram during which we saw buffaloes, wild cows, antelopes, deer, tapir, 3 elephants, a hippopotamus, a giraffe and at last a supposedly white lion lying on its back. We could have spent this wasted time visiting another attraction during our short visit of Singapore. It was also a huge waste of money. In my view the night safari is only worth visiting if the trail is done on foot. I didn't see anybody walking though. We got there at 5.30 to be among the firsts in the queue, it paid off. Food is very expensive."
,,Another must on every trip with the children,5.0,,"Singapore Night Safari is my favorite Zoo in the World ! Nothing comes close to it educational wise or entertainment wise , with some of the most endangered creatures in the World conserved and breeding programmers set up for them , Clouded Leopards , Tarsiers , Pangolins, and Asian Golden Cats are all well cared of just to name a few , take the trails you will see a lot more in comparison with the Tram were you see very little , the Asian Fishing Cat Trail and the Leopard Trails are very rewarding"
,,Night Safari,1.0,,"This was one of the most disappointing tours I have ever done. After the 1/2 hour in the Taxi and then lining up for over 1 hour. There were about 7 exhibits of different deer, and most of the other animals were hard to see or stunned into frozen like behavior. Very unhappy with this place. The best thing was the fire twirling guys and their fire breathing skills. I would not recommend this Safari at all !!!"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"The cost of the entrance was quite high but then again what isn't expensive in Singapore!
The night safari was probably good for young children under 7 I would say as the show and the tram ride was more suited to them...we went as a four (kids aged 13 & 10) and they were not too enthusiastic to say the least on either the show or night safari.
It is a busy attraction so booking the first entrance is a must in my opinion as you are then guaranteed to see everything although the queues for the tram are long!"
,,FUN for Everyone,5.0,,If you're ever in Singapore this is a one of a kind must see attraction. We have taken every house guest here and it never disappoints. The lions roaring into the night and bat house are two highlights!
,,A good night out,4.0,,"We were offered this attraction as part of a package which was just as well because we visited on a Saturday evening and it was very crowded. Our tour status ensured we had priority access which reduced the wait for a free car from 90 to 30 minutes!
The tour is done using an electric land train on a Tarmac lane that winds through the park. There are two or three carriages to each train with an amplified live commentary starting with a safety lecture and a plea not to use flash or infra red focusing on phones or cameras
The success of your trip is entirely dependent upon on how well the animals can hide and for the most part they were most obliging especially the tapir, rhino and Malay tiger all much larger than expected
The meal, included in our tour, is conducted as a buffet in a large covered space with wooden tables and benches arranged around a series of buffet islands catering for many different cuisines. We were placed in the oriental area which meant a long walk and queue for those in our party seeking western foods
It is possible to walk through the park crisis-crossing the land train lane (supervised by park officials) though I am not sure how close this brings you to the animals
There is also a Disney like ""Show"" that presents some of the animals;otters, owls, a python etc and ironically calls for better ecological protection of the animals. After this there is a rush for taxis and tour buses, although if you were not on a tour you could walk through the park until closing time at two am, which we might do next time"
,,"Impressive Zoo, especially during the night",5.0,,"Impressive Zoo, especially during the night when you can ses all the animals out there - or their eyes anyway. Kind of scary but impressive."
,,Great !!,5.0,,"As we were waiting we saw the Tumbuakar's amazing performance with fire..
Creatures of the night show was amazing and my son volunteered and got chance for one of the activities.
Amazing way to travel through the seven geographical zones is by a 40 minute long open air guided tram where you can see the animals from close quarters !!"
,,Its dark at night,3.0,,I had been looking forward to taking the family to this event for ages. I started to well with the fire eaters however it quickly went downhill as disk came and darkness fell. The queue for transport was oh so long so we walked. The visibility was so poor that we could hardly see any of the animals.
,,The worst experience!,1.0,,"Completely disorganised! Excessively long queues with no regard for crowd control. Feral visitors pushing in and staff turning a blind eye even when its pointed out. Don't waste your time or money on this, its farcical at best. Que for over an hour for tickets and then get crushed at the entry que for the tram, where you'll wait at least another 90 minutes, and then the tram stops for the briefest of time to move to the next enclosure. You can walk, which we weren't told about until well into the wait. Would NEVER recommend this"
,,Pleasantly Surprised,4.0,,"I have been skipping a visit to night safari ask the senior in my 15 year stay in Singapore with the notion that it would be the same as the day zoo. But I was pleasantly surprised when I had to tag along with a few visitors who had come from India. The night version opens up a completely different world and their offering is a big differentiator as you get to be more up close with the animals enjoying the tram ride. Impressive. Moreover for lazy bums like myself, this is a leisure way of looking at zoo as compared to flexing your muscles"
,,Nice zoo,4.0,,Kids enjoyed the trim ride and the animal show. Tasty Indian buffet than many other places in Singapore. Didn't like the long cue waiting for trim riding
,,Quite boring,3.0,,Me and my friends went to Singapore safari by the month of december last year and i find it quite boring. Most of the animals were sleeping and you won't see all of them once you ride the shuttle that goes around the zoo.
,,very popular attraction,4.0,,"We visited the night zoo monday night, still we had to que. Saw the animal show and took the round in the ""train"". The zoo was well organized but animals could have bigger areas."
,,Disappointing and Chaotic,2.0,,"This was our most disappointing experience in Singapore. Don't be fooled by the publicity. The animals don't have much room and cold weather creatures cannot thrive in the heat. The entry procedure is tortuous; you can book and pay ahead, but you will end up waiting in a hideous queue for maybe an hour, even if you come early as directed. We felt we had wasted our time and would rather have done anything else"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Didn't see many animals & was very very busy when I went. Not sure on the value of this visit. Did enjoy the food area & night entertainment
,,My Family Enjoyed It But I Had Trouble Seeing The Animals,4.0,,"I visited Singapore on business in June 2016. My wife, son and daughter joined me. The night safari at the Singapore Zoo is a very good place if you have children. You have to take a long MRT (subway) ride and bus to get there. Once you go in, there is an animal show first which was enjoyable. Then you take the tram and are given a tour where the animals are pointed out. My family enjoyed it but sometimes I had trouble seeing the animals. I would definitely recommend this if you are in Singapore for 4-5 days. You can take a taxi back if necessary and it was not that expensive, about 25 Singapore dollars."
,,Terrible!,1.0,,"After being made to queue up for entrance for hours I was so annoyed that there was no crowd control and people just kept bunching and pushing to get closest to the gates. I have been to concerts, sporting events, opening events, travelled elsewhere and never experienced anything like it. Do not queue up, resist the urge! Wait until the night safari actually opens and than wander in like a normal person not like a stampeding elephant and I didn't understand what the crush was about? What were they all rushing too? The night safari is terrible, we couldn't see a thing, they use moonlight to light the place, there is no lighting visible to my eye, all the animals were sleeping or hiding. I have been to night zoos before and normally at dusk theres the noises of animals roaring, chatting etc, here silence, the only sounds were of tourists asking ""where are all the animals at""? was all we could hear. Terrible. And that show at the start with the fire was horrendous- all the guys were doing was spitting fire starter all over themselves- it was actually quite laughable but I couldn't laugh as I was being pushed in the back and pressed up against random strangers desperate for photos, really if that show impressed you, you need to get out more."
,,One if its kind unique safari,5.0,,You can see Animals in its natual habitat under the nights shade. Not sure if these animals are from jungle or the once from other zoo and brought in here. Nevertheless is a worth ride looking at these different animals with variety of skills.
,,Great experience,5.0,,This is a great opportunity to see wild life during the night. The animals are active and you have a great view to them.
,,Night Safari in SG,3.0,,"This is my second visit after ten years.

Good but quite annoying other tourists
Sometime, on a night tram they didnt keep quiet nor turnon the flash light. The tram leader also warned them many times but they still did not follow.

Unlike the great atmostphere what we had 10 years ago, a night tram tour was great and felt the real night safari atmostphere!

Please beware to visit a night safari if you has young children. They might be tired from other day zoo and end up with night safari at an ending of the day!"
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Hi,

I have been to this place with family and we all liked it very much. It is a perfect place for tourist .
Safari starts with fire show at the entrance which is too good. During the safari one can get out of tram and walk till the end of safari during which one can explore wallaby trail which can't be missed.

Strongly recommended

Regards,
Prakash Matuwani"
,,Great for the family,4.0,,Definitely something different but prepare for the queues. Best advice is go to the creatures of the night show as som. As you get in and then the crowds to get on the tram die down a bit from 9 am. Plenty of affordable food outlets out the front and we found the easiest way to get there was by taxi. No problems getting a taxi home either there was a massive queue waiting outside even at 11pm. If you want to get there at 7.15pm and wish to repurchase you need to do that 2 days prior online as it sells out. The later sessions at usually ok to book the night before.
,,"Nice experience, take your time to enjoy it",4.0,,"It is a nice and unique experience: I don't know many places where you can walk at night in a rain-forest like environment feeling safe :)
You can choose to take the open-sided bus (which they call ""tram"") and go for a 40 minutes ride around the park, or you can walk through the thematic trails. If you have enough time simply do both: first the walking trails (in this way you can avoid the crowd at the tram stop) and then, later on the tram trip to see different sides of the park and also to rest your legs for a while.

Small reminder: it's night, so do not expect to have a clear sight of all the animals and do not expect them to be too active. Take the experience as it is: you are able to walk in the jungle at night without being eaten by some exotic animal.

I strongly suggest to book the tickets in advance online, maybe in combination with the other parks a select the earliest possible slot if you want to enjoy the place and still be able to get back home without spending money on a cab."
,,Safari fun,4.0,,"When we arrived joined a giant line, was unable to see the fireshow along the side as there was way to many people in front. Once through the first gate was told the show was already full and to join the ""tram safari"" line, this line was also extremely long. After a long wait we finally got on board. The safari its self was great very dark so a little hard to see some animals. Good variety of animals. Went for about half an hour. Had an audio about the animals as we went around. After the tram ride we got directed down the path, but realised this was the exit when we asked the lady at the gate about how to get in to do the walking tracks or show she said we would have to go all the way back through. This was very messy organisation. The restaurants here were also very overpriced although good variety."
,,Memorable experience,5.0,,"This was very interesting since it's not usual for us to see these animals at night but it's also a bit scary since the animals are in open cages and some are even beside the road. I think the only animal that was in a cage was the tiger. I would not personally walk on a trail since I'm too afraid to do that even if there are plenty of guides around. But, I think I will still go back with my kids and still ride the tram."
,,Neither one thing nor the other,3.0,,We went on the Night Safari and were somewhat underwhelmed. It was a Friday night and there were thousands of people. Be prepared to queue for some time. The view of the animals was limited on the tram. I'd recommend walking the trails to see the animals rather than using the tram. The tiger is absolutely beautiful.
,,Didn't live up to the hype,2.0,,"The night safari was a let down! We paid for priority boarding, which also included a 10 minute show with a few animals at the start, the train ride around the park and a fire show.

We did see several animals inc elephants, Tigers, hippos and lots of types of deer, but the train doesn't really stop along the way as there are so many groups behind it. As such you catch a glimpse at best.

The enclosures were also much smaller than we expected and many of the animals were lying down away from the route.

I personally didn't think the cost matched the value so didn't stay long."
,,Was very crowded,4.0,,The only place in Singapore where we had to wait for so long to get into the tram. Was with my kid - who turned fuzzy because of the crowd. Tourist crowd who need a little more number of people to guide them around.
,,magic night,5.0,,We took the Night safari tour. Despite the initial crowds it was so well organised and its the credit to all staff who work hard to make it a success.
,,Enjoyable but...,3.0,,"Had heard rave reviews about this safari, and frankly I was disappointed. The night pavilion show was a great disappointment. Could have been amazing, but was pretty average. Train ride was fun, but the animals were not so exciting."
,,A novel excursion away from the city,5.0,,"I visited this site in September, which was a fun way to extend the day and enjoy some cooler evening weather. The tour is decent, and the animals sightings are relatively frequent. Flash is not allowed while you are on the tour vehicle, but you can photograph the show. It's a bit of a drive but not overly expensive."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"A little campy but overall a fun experience. The lines could be a little better organized. The venue is clean, enjoyed the fire breathers while waiting for the show to start. Other than the line up everything is well organized."
,,Not bad,3.0,,Its good but not that good if u go to the singapore zoo dont go night safari and if u didnt go then night safari is good but its not like what i thought and i like the zoo more
,,Wild experience,4.0,,"Oops didn't know. Had the 7.15 tickets but Should have got there at 6 30 ish to have a chance to see the free fire breathing show outside, missed that. And even though we got there on time. The queues were huge! 100's of people had the 7.15 tickets and half got to see the 7.30 show. We just missed it, so went on the tram which takes 40 minutes. Brilliantly designed so we can see lots of animals out and about at night. If we had come without young kids aged 6 and 7 We would have done the 1 hour walking trail. That must be fantastic! When we got off the tram we had just missed the 8.30 show which was now full! So then had to wait for th 9.30 show. Kids getting tired but we got the best seats being first in the queue. The show lasted half an hour only sadly as we were really enjoying it! Taxi rank outside was a blessing"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Don't know if we picked a bad night, but didn't see many animals at all. They were either asleep or hiding. Wasent overly impressed. The fire breathing dancers were good, if you could get past the smell of kerosene."
,,Nice peaceful ride,3.0,,"The night safari is surely better than the zoo and the river safari.
There are long queues to get in, and once you get in, you again have to stand in lines for the tram ride. All the tram stations give the same ride so going for is enough. The good thing is that you don't need to walk this one and the rides not that long."
,,Kids loved this Jurassic Park type experience.,5.0,,"We booked this online with govoyagin. They offered 15% discount on the price the hotel were offering. Very easy as voucher e mailed to me which I redeemed on arrival at the park. Missed the queue for ticket purchase and saved 8 dollars per ticket.

The Night Safari is quite a bit from the City Center so if travelling from Sentosa as we were it is worth going across to Vivo City and getting taxi from there as booking from Sentosa can be quite expensive.

We went on a Sunday night and it was really busy both the 715pm and the 815pm tours were booked out by the time we got there. Might be worth aiming for the 915pm which was a little more relaxed. The park closes at 12.

The teenagers loved the fruit bats and the flying squirrel. You have to go into their enclosures and it all feels a little Jurassic Parkish.

We did the tram and this was worthwhile but enjoyed doing two of the trails as well.

Well worth a visit and kids will enjoy the roaring lions and close up encounters with many Asian animals some of which are now endangered."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Saw the animals Lion,Tiger,Elephant name it from a close distance.Night Safari is highly recommended."
,,Just like being in the Jungle,5.0,,We really enjoyed our night safari but the kids absolutely loved it! It feels like there are no barriers between you and the animals which obviously makes for a more real experience. A must do whilst in Singapore.
,,concise zoo visit concept in night,4.0,,"reach a little early to beat the crowd at night safari, I'll say reach by 6. the queues start piling up and as expected crowds are more during weekends. once you get in, a train /tram cart takes you through the night safari with running commentary. the animals seem very peaceful and maybe behind thick glasses (not sure). you get a feel of being in the jungle at night. little scary but exciting as well. there are shows to attend to once you are done with the night safari tram trip. don't miss them, they are good and at specific times only.
food options are plenty once you are done with all the night safari offerings.

I'll suggest if you have plenty of time and love for animals to go visit the Singapore zoo instead."
,,Loved this for the experience,5.0,,"We booked this as part of the online 4 park promo.

It's very confusing ticketing as they give you times, so we booked 7:15 and assumed this is the time we need to get on a tram to do our safari, but the times are just for entry to park.

The creatures of night show was good, my young kids enjoyed it.

Thereafter we queued up for 15-20 mins for the tram to go round the park- not a freestyle safari. The tram takes you round the enclosures, so you see the animals as you would in their enclosures but at night- we saw all of them snd they were awake and in view.

Just like normal zoo, you are able to view feeding times too. Make sure you get the tram with language of your choice!

After this we watched the fire show and because it was so late, ate at Indian tandoor ( halal outlet), before we left.

All in all a good one-off experience. Very tiring for young kids so ensure they have daytime rest/nap!"
,,Watching animals at night !,3.0,,"The notion it's at night time, we bought tickets for it..Never seen animals in the zoo at night time before. The queue was horrendous..As we were queuing with children it was unbearable not to mention there Was another long queue inside after u passed the long queue outside.. the crowd were entertained by a cool show with 2 half naked man breathing out fire while waiting outside.. After the misery of the queues..we embarked on our tour on long jeep/train stopping along the way showing us the animals.The whole experience with such a long queue in a nut shell was overrated..Did not really feel it got the wow factor..something different yes..Did not fulfill our expectations ."
,,Ms,5.0,,Well worth the journey - we went for the 9.15 the place was exceptionally busy with long queues we decided to go on the bus trip around and then did all the walks - not a trip for very young ur elderly if you wish to walk - saw many animals but not all - There was a lot of dear and cattle which was a little disappointing but the elephants and tiger were great - loved the bats as well - we walked steadily and covered everything we left just after 12 the place closes at 12.15 - my kids said this was their favourite trip
,,Ordinary stuff...,1.0,,Night safari on tram is a pretty ordinary stuff...the tram takes you through jungle...and shows you different animals... Avoid creatures of jungle show... Like all other things in Singapore - hardly a value for money!
,,Lots of long queues but otherwise great experience,4.0,,"We visited the zoo as early as possible given we had a 4 year old with us. The gates for us opened at 7pm and there was a queue to get in. Bit was then through the gates and into an even bigger and slow moving queue to catch one of the teams around the zoo. It appeared that there were other shorter tram stops nearby but most people were directed into the long one and there was very little signage suggestion there may be other options. The ""need"" to take souvenir photos of everyone in the trains certainly slowed the process unnecessarily.

The tram ride when we finally got on it was very good and it was a chance to see animals we hadn't seen before.

Once off the tram we followed some of the trails to look at the animals again. It seemed that once you were on them, it was either turn around a me go back or follow them all to the end. Options to return to the entry gate at different stages of the trails would have been good. Our little one had had enough about halfway round as it was nearing 10pm and it was a very long way back to the exit gate.

Otherwise a unique experience and well worth visiting if you are in Singapore."
,,Not worth the hassle,3.0,,"Lines going inside were managed poorly. Comparable to a mob scrambling to get inside. You have to carry kids below five feet in height to watch the fire show while waiting for your batch's scheduled entry. This while there's barely any space to move. We went on a Saturday so maybe weekdays are less disorderly. But then again even if you have the park to yourself, I don't think it's worth the time. The creatures of the night show was way better a when I went there more than decade ago. The host was great but the program itself lacked excitement."
,,A slow ride into the singapore zoo.,3.0,,"Kids found it exciting, however we hardly see any action among the animals. Most of them are eating or drowsy. I wonder how is it that they stay in place while a train is moving in front of them. But there is a canal between the tram and the animals, and so its just safe. I doubt if the animals were just sleepy or have some dose of sedatives."
,,Booked by a friend as a wedding present,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this as it was something different seeing the animals in the dark. We decided to go on the tram. When we saw the queue we thought we would never get on, however it moved fairly quickly as the staff were efficient.
We also stayed and watched the Nocturnal animals show after we had, had some lovely Indian cuisine to eat."
,,Much better to walk through,4.0,,"It was very very nice but donot recommend to take the bus, just walk through till the jammed line for the bus get clear and enjoy the ride.
I spend the day in the zoo and had lunch just infront of the zoo then to the night safari. Must visit."
,,Really great,5.0,,"We really loved this place, but just wish there was more to do and see. The team that let's you see all the night animals was amazing but there's little more to see and do here. It's usually very crowded so your best bet is to go during the week. Still recommend it as its not likely you'll see these animals so up close anywhere else."
,,"Interesting, but don't get on tram",2.0,,"The way to do this is on foot, they have put in a huge effort on the animal habitats and you won't get to see more animals than this in their natural habitat. That said the tram was poor, very noisy, moved too fast to get more than a glimpse although that impressed me enough to want to see more. If you go though take earplugs, the human animals make a huge amount of noise and I couldn't get away from the main areas quick enough, they have done a good thing and deserve support."
,,Safe but not exciting,4.0,,"If you have visited the zoo at day time, then not much point of going across the parking lot to stay for the Night Safari or vice versa. You will be on the tram driven around but the animals are behind the open-space enclosures. Very safe for visitors but not as exciting as the other safari where the encounter is lot closer ..."
,,One if the best,5.0,,"The Singapore zoo is one of my favorite. I have beeb to many in different countries and i can say this was the best of them. Very organized and maintained. If you have young children sure they will enjoy it there.

Tip:

If you buy tickets to Singapore zoo (close at 6:00 pm) and night safari (opens at 7:15 pm) then go directly to at 6 to night safari and be the first in the long line waiting for the ride. Because the later you go the longer you will wait in line for the night safari ride."
,,Nice but overcrowded,3.0,,I cant believe how long we waited until we got into the ride. The ride was a creative idea but the waiting time ( 1:40 minutes) made me regret going there. If you hate lining up for long time then don't go or go once in your life and be deeply prepared for it.
,,ok kind no excitement,2.0,,"its ok kind of safari no thrill and no feel of real jungle, got bored feel like moving in zoo jurong bird park is better Option than this"
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore,5.0,,I have been 4 times now over the last 10 years. It's a great place with or without children. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore.
,,Ideal way to see animals,4.0,,"Right way of seeing wild animals , in their natural form and at night time and covers almost all wild animals but the line is sometimes very big"
,,"Absolute joke, don't do it!",1.0,,Queued for over half an hour to just get into the night safari under some feeble fans with no air conditioning. Way too crowded to the point of it being dangerous as customers surged forward to see a show going on at the side-very poorly planned and controlled. Once in the trams had over an hour wait. Decided to walk the trails which don't allow you to see all the animals and you can't go on the road that the trams are on. Saying that that's if you can even see them at all! Badly lit with most animals cowering at the back of their enclosures so you can't see them. Don't take a camera as you wont get any decent pictures. There are hardly an places on route where you can buy water either! Once out was subjected to long queues once again for grossly overpriced rancid food. Will never go back here and certainly not one of Singapore's top attractions. Don't waste your money and just go to the zoo during the day which is a great day out.
,,Fantastic a must see,5.0,,"We did the zoo in the day and then the night safari after it as they are next to each other and out of the city.
You are free to roam around the 4 small walking paths at your own pace and order.
The main path you must go on the open carts to see.
There are big lines for the open carts as soon as you enter so we did 2 walking paths first and then went on the carts after when the lines were gone.
We decided to see the live show, line up early as the lines get really big. Its worth seeing the show
We then went back and did the walking paths we missed earlier.
This was a fantastic experience and most of the animals were moving around and eating.
So worth doing this, we went in when it opened and we stayed till close.
Make sure you pre book your tickets as the ticket queue there is big, you will have to book for a specific night though"
,,A superb evening out,5.0,,We'd been before but our daughters hadn't - but they and we really enjoyed the experience again. And a nice meal to follow afterwards!
,,Overcrowded waist of money.Long waits.,1.0,,"Had a great 3 days in Singapore finishing with a very disappointing Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo.Arrived at 6.30 Pm and lined up in very long que finally boarding tram at 9.00pm.40 minute ride only very underwhelming.Lots of deer etc.Poor lighting.Food expensive, no water being sold near tram lines.Save yourself some stress and time by enjoying something else whilst in Singapore."
,,An unique experience,5.0,,"One is entertained from the moment of arrival till exit. will need 2+ hours to really enjoyed the experience. The included ""creatures of the night"" show should not be missed. For family with small children recommend to go early. Saw a number of family have to literally carry all the children because they just could not stay awake in all that darkness and heat.

The high entrance cost may seem like a negative point at first. However if one consider the whole thing as a live production then the price is very reasonable."
,,"Fantastic night visit, thoroughly enjoyed",5.0,,"We booked this in advance as we were recommended it by many different people -and we were not disappointed!

We booked with a pick up at our hotel, then triaged a few buses together then headed to the zoo at dusk.

We had dinner in our event and we went straight to the restaurant - the food was plentiful and really high quality.

We then went on our tram tour through the animal areas, the highlights for me being the elephants and rhinos. My son took a particularly good photo of the elephant which I'll attach here.

We then had the animal show which was great fun before we headed back to our hotel.

Definitely recommended."
,,Don't do it!,1.0,,"I was excited to do this trip, got us a 20% discount. We even made it an adventure by taking public transport there. That is where anything positive ends!
As soon as we got there it was just queues! You get given a time, ours was 9.15. You'd think that meant you'd enter the zoo a5 this time, but no! We didn't actually enter the zoo till 10.15, then we got told we could do the 4 walking tours before getting in the tram, but the zoo closes at 12, and the team ride takes 40 mins. So we continued to queue for another 40 mins. The tram ride was OK, but you didn't really get your see much, and animals didn't seem natural to me. We eventually go out at 11.15. By this stage we both had headaches and felt truly ripped off, so went home.
But the queues again were mad crazy to get public transport or taxis. I thought I might cry. Luckily I'd downloaded an app called grab, and I managed to get us a taxi while hundreds of others continued to queue!
I honestly felt like this was a rip off. We spent more time queuing than enjoying the attraction. It's almost like they just want another opportunity to make money off the tourists. 1 park split into 4, so if you want to see all the animals you have to pay loads. Ohhh and you can avoid queues of course, but that also costs more money. So no giant panda for us on this trip, cos for that you need the boat safari! It's a joke."
,,"Overrated, overcrowded, overpriced",1.0,,"We cannot believe this is listed as top thing to do in Singapore.
Although the concept is good, the execution is extremely poor. The crowds are unmanageable, all we did was wait, wait and wait.
Arrived at 7pm, 7:15 and 8:15 entries were all sold out. Ok, we take 9:15 thinking we will have time to have dinner and then still plenty of time to do the show (9:30), tram and trails. Gosh, we were so wrong...
Food is overpriced, and not even good. Then we queue again with the other people with 9:15 tickets. Staff blocked the gates just before us saying there was a 1h30hr queue for the tram. So we have 9:15 tickets, but we still cannot go in?!. Ok... can we go in for the show? No, the 9:30 show is already full.
I don't get this, if you let a certain amount of people in at a certain time, then you need to police people to leave as well or the principle does not work. Unless you have 7:15 ticvkets, there is no way you can do the show that is scheduled 15min later.
By the way, that show, ""creatures of the night"" is a joke. There is a line for that, but you will see a raccoon, some type of lemurian, a snake, a hyenaand that's about it. Dont expect anything fancy worth the pain, no, just a girl who hypes the crowd.
Then back to the tram, back to another long line. We finally make it to one of the last trams (thanks to Chand, only updise of the night!). Our driver obviously had enough, he kept pushing the gas pedal, we were right behind another tram all the time. He would have to hit the brake pedal not to rerar end it in some turns, we thought he wanted to pass. Some animals were active, but most were not or so far back in their areas that we could not see them anyway.
Summary of the evening: we arrived at 7pm, we had a horrible meal, saw a horrible ""show"" (can;t believe they even use that word, it's barely a presentation of 5 animals) and took a 40minute tram. We left at midnight. If I include dinner, say 1.5hr of ""fun"" for 3.5hr wait. Impossible to do the trails with all that time wasted in queues. Totally not wort it. If you want to use timed entries, then make sure the number of people is appropriate, and people exit. If you enter at 7:15, you can spend the night there, if you enter at 10:15, you will enjoy the long lines (since the ones from previous hours don't have to leave). Completely stupid, very poor management and execution."
,,15 Minute Experience not Worth 3 Hours of Lining up.,3.0,,"Booked for a 21:15 show, got there 45 minutes early with my son who is 4. Stood in line to redeem voucher, although i had purchased the ticket online, all i got was a redemption voucher from my hotel's handy phone. Word of advise, book online through the night safari website if you want to jump the cue and redeem them from the ticketing kiosk. Got my tickets at 21:30. Lined up at the entry gates and finally made it to the Tram by 22:40, and we were out of there by 23:00. The experience was good, The tram ride and the collection of Animals was great, don't get me wrong but with a 4 year old or younger kids the wait is just terrible and especially at the time of the night when they are struggling to stay awake. P.S. i had to carry my sleeping 4 year old through most of the wait so i can skip gym for a week :P. Try and go for an earlier show which usually is booked out real quick."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit here and the animals were really active. We bought tickets online but then had to queue for about 30 minutes to slowly get through the gates. After that it was fine - we didn't queue for the tram straight away as we had read it could take a while to get one. We just went off on a walk around the different trails which was great. We walked for about 90 minutes and then jumped on a tram tour when it was much quieter.

We had a great evening and would recommend visiting when in Singapore! We simply got an Uber from the centre of town and back again (there is wifi available in the safari if you need it)."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"the tram tour is great, lively commentary and you must go and take a tour of the trails, totally amazing to see the animals more active at night. Limited food choices and don't be alarmed by the opening crowds once people disperse there is plenty of room to explore for everyone. Eerie feeling listening to the animal sounds at night"
,,Interesting and fun,5.0,,"This tram ride gets you up close to many animals you might not have seen at the zoo or who are often inactive in the day time. Nice not to be walking, but big crowds and a few queuing issues. Be prepared to wait in line."
,,Worth to try,4.0,,"Night safari is next to singapore zoo and river safari. Is really nice experience if you never try night safari. Only when we came is really chaotic, is tourists season so we must take 1 hours for the queue but is really worth to try."
,,Overcrowded,2.0,,"We were looking forward to this as something different to do. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. Although ticket sales are ""limited"" daily, they sell by far too many tickets and the staff seem a bit over-whelmed by this and are not especially helpful and there was a distinct lack of organisation. The queue for the ""safari ride"" was ridiculously long and we didn't even manage to get into the show due to high numbers. It's a shame the last bus leaves before the park closes as it may get quieter towards midnight. The walk around to see the animals in the dark was the only good aspect really."
,,Better than the Zoo!,5.0,,"First of all, this is very similar to what you can experience in the Zoo - just a lot better! Most of the animals are more active during the night, the lighting is not too strong to disturb them, just enough for you to see them, and you can get pretty close to them, so it gives you a lot more than the traditional Zoo IMHO!
It's so interesting everywhere prepare for several hours of strolling around! :)"
,,Recommended if you're visiting Singapore,4.0,,"We visited the Night Safari in August, and luckily it was not raining. You need to choose your spot carefully when queuing at the entrance in order to enjoy the 7 pm performance especially with young kids. You will probably have better luck when leaving the park. I recommend you take the tram first to explore the different sections before you walk the trails. Overall it was fun for the whole family, and I highly recommend if you're visiting Singapore."
,,One of the best zoos,5.0,,"I have never been to a zoo at night, but I will tell you it was a very different experience. I would say that there are things that you will not see as clearly because it is dark, but having this experience is something that everyone should have. My advice is to get there right as the night Safari opens which I think is around 6 PM, that way you will have both a daylight and nighttime experience"
,,Best Night Safari ever,5.0,,"The safari starts at 7.15pm but make sure you get there well in time. There are serpentine queues but well managed by the staff . The excitement begins once you hop on the tram for an amazing experience. The tour by the tram takes about 45 minutes and there are optional walking tours as well. The proximity to the animals was just amazing. We spotted a deer so close to us that we could almost touch it. The elephants were majestic and the African Lion a royal treat.
Must visit place."
,,Good trip for families,4.0,,"Generally, it is over-crowded in the queues unless you have a priority pass. The safari rides begins only around 7 pm and lasts for an hour. It is nice to see the animals in their natural habitats. As the ride is in pitch dark environment, flash photography is not permitted. Overall, a good ambiance for the family and kids to get excited. For those who have good energy to walk, would recommend taking the walking hike to see the animals. Awesome experience! Must also try the Gelato ice-creams after the ride for a refresher."
,,Busy place but worth the visit,4.0,,"We got a taxi from our hotel to the zoo for the night safari. We had to buy the 9.15 entry as others full. We ate dinner there and visited the River aqarium before it was out turn to go in. They let 3000 people in every hour. It sounds a lot but the place is big although the entrance could have more gates as took awhile to get in. We opted to do a few of the walking trails first as tram was in high demand. It was interesting to see the animals at night, some of them were eating. The fruit bats were eating bananas and the otters were very noisy calling for the keeper to feed them but they were very active. We got on the tram at station 3 and were glad of it as we had walked a long way by that time. The tram commentary was good and it was easy to see the animals as it stopped everytime there was something to see. It is not cheap to do the safari unless you get it as part of a package but still worthwhile. The food at the cafe by the entrance was good."
,,Crowded as usual,4.0,,"You would think that after they changed it to a time slot ticketing system, the human traffic flow would have improved but in fact it's become worse and very haphazard. I'll give them the benefit of a doubt that they're still working out the bugs in the new system.

The tram ride, although as good as usual, had the usual crowd but this time no priority boarding for annual pass holders which I find very frustrating. Staff on the tram are very slack too because there were so many people using flash photography yet they didn't do or say anything about it.

Despite all these failings it is still a good place to bring the young family because where else in Singapore do you get to see so many animals in one place.

However I urge the management to look into these teething problems as well as improve some of the exhibits for the future."
,,Easily the best night Zoo in the world,5.0,,Take the trails after the amphitheatre show. Then the Trams for a full tour. Multiple visits is recommended
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,Can take the tram to minimize the walking needed to see all the animals. There are a few short trails that are easily accessable as well. Try to be there early since children can get very tired by 10 p.m.. The que for taxi will seem endless when you have small children all falling asleep around you.
,,There are 2 Zoos and the night Zoo is not to be missed but pay for a tour!,5.0,,"There are two (2) Zoos, 1 day and 1 night one. We want to the night safari and what a fantastic setup. I am glad that we paid for a tour as we skipped Long queues for tickets and straight onto the little train that takes you around looking at the animals from a comfortable seat which is great if you have trouble walking. Up close and personal and the animals were all up and about as they are nocturnal which means that they came out at night time. So close that you cannot see the little wire fence between them and you. Very busy anytime with weekends even more so. Plenty to eat and drink with slightly higher prices but not over the top."
,,Amazing and original concept!,4.0,,"Reaching the zoo for the night safari without a car is not easy. The advertised public transport on their website from woodlands is not possible after 6pm yet the night safari doesn't open until 7.30pm. This was a surprise for us and meant an expensive taxi which was unplanned. There are other busses but knowing which one is still operating is not clear.

We booked in advance which was best as the first two admissions were sold out on arrival leaving only 9.30pm. Despite booking we still had an hour wait for the tram. In hindsight we probably should have walked first and returned to the tram afterwards.

The concept of exploring the zoo at night when the nocturnal animals are most active is unique but more logical - we saw the animals being far more natural (and interesting) at their peak times. This did begin to tire out by 9.30/10 though as even they began to settle down for the night. The walk through the bat enclosure and other enclosures puts you right up close with the wild animals and really improves the experience.

To end the evening an enjoyable show was given for some of the smaller nocturnal animals which was an enjoyable 45 minutes. The food options promptly close though leaving little choice for dinner if you choose to frequent these expensive eateries.

Overall very enjoyable for all ages and would recommend for a variety to the normal zoo experience."
,,Maybe by Asia standards?,3.0,,I am not sure of what is considered good in Asia for safaris and zoos? However it is very pricey and under delivers compared with Australia. May be ok for locals to enjoy a night out but not an international tourist destination.
,,"Interesting evening, with great potential.",4.0,,"So glad I did research on internet before committing to buying tickets. Ended up booking through Viator - first experience with this site which turns out to be a TripAdvisor affiliate. So good were they in taking booking and allowing for crowds. Being National Day extra crowds were expected, and were there. Our tour began when we were picked up from hotel in minibus and taken to Chinatown where we joined more people on a coach which took us to Night Safari. Upon arrival and instructions we went in to enjoy sumptuous buffet dinner - great selection of delicious dishes, hot and cold, with desserts and drinks. Not too crowded, good wait staff. After dinner we had priority boarding on tram ride throughout the forest. Queue for general public would have taken ages to be in turn. The commentary was in good English. Animals were ordinary - nothing exciting or startling. I liked the environmental and preservation messages. Then we watched a fire eating and dancing display - good but not outstanding. The last item on the evening agenda was the Creatures of the Night performance, which I thought was fairly insignificant and somewhat amateurish. Could have been so much better. However, all in all an entertaining night out."
,,Victim of success,3.0,,"I visited the night safari many years ago when they first started. It was very good and felt very comfortable and the zoo was impressive. However this visit was very very crowded, visitors were grouped into different time slots at an attempt of crowd control. However it was still very very crowded, we had to miss the show to get into the tram. It was such a long wait for the tram ride that that we did not have much energy to go on the walking trails."
,,Only Speaking of Night Safari,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari at Singapore Zoo on a Saturday night, and it was hot and crowded. Waited in line over an hour for a 20 minute tram ride through the park, to see ""nocturnal"" animals that were, for the most part, laying around looking as though they'd rather someone turned off all the lights so they could sleep. I feel like this would have been a much better visit during the day, preferably on a day of low (for Singapore) humidity. We did get to hear Asian wolves howling, which was quite spectacular."
,,Zoo with kids,5.0,,"Did the night safari which was excellent , we got the bus there as part of our trip which was good as the guide just walks through the crowds which there is a lot of !
Sat down in private area to eat as part of the trip , food ok , just what you'd expect from a guided trip , guide got us straight on the tram and then when that finished walked us through some more attractions , worth going just to say you've done it .."
,,A Great Evening!,4.0,,"I waited for years before giving the Night Safari a shot as I heard so many mixed reviews about it, mostly complaints saying that it’s a waste of time and that you do not get to see many animals as it is dark.

How wrong were these reviews?! I am so glad I disregarded them and went over to check it out myself. This place is great! First of all, it has 4 intake times - 7.15pm, 8.15pm, 9.15pm and 10.15pm – be aware and plan your visit accordingly, as it closes at midnight. We went for the 9.15pm onwards slot and we didn’t have enough time to finish exploring the whole place..really regret that :( We were literally chased out at midnight because we were hanging around doing the walking trails without checking our watches haha!

I would call the Night Safari a slow paced unique adventure. Guests will get a chance to witness a fire-breathing Thumbuakar Performance at the entrance, which is very interesting! Once you enter the premises, I suggest you start off with the Creatures of the Night Show which is really organized and informative. You can then tour the place on a tram, discovering the wildlife of 7 geographical regions. Once you’re done with that, you can further explore the premises on foot, exploring the four interlinked walking trails. My suggestion is go there early and have the entire evening to explore the place at your leisure.

I must say that we were thoroughly impressed by how organized the whole concept was. Even though the crowd was large, you hardly felt it as everything was organized very smoothly! Well done, Night Safari Team! It was truly a great evening :) "
,,Worth a visit... But not managed well,4.0,,"The safari is a with a visit. But the management very amateurish. So many tram stops with no clarity on which one totals. Surprise to see reservation seven in amphi theatre for the shows. No clear directions/ announcements.
But during the safari one can see white lions, tigers,rhinos and other creatures."
,,Super Safari,4.0,,"The safari opens in the evening and quite interesting The train moves very slow inside with commentary in English.The animals are very close and great to see Lions,Elephants,Hippo,etc"
,,No. 1 poor managed zoo,1.0,,"If you have time to waste, wait for hours and see for minutes, then go for it.
If you are bored with other attractions in the city, and want to spend an hour travelling time in your trip, then go for it.
If you are confident to be safe in a big crowd in the dark, without any assistance of staff, then go for it.
It you have excellent vision and imagination, see and imagine what animals you see in the dark, then go for it.
If you want to train your EQ and patience, then go for it."
,,A sleepy adventure,3.0,,We purchased tickets for the 9.15pm safari but actually went on the tram about an hour later. The queue to purchase tickets for the show was ridiculous (waited over 30 minutes). The animal show beforehand was interesting but short and we were told at least 10 times to not use cameras with a flash (I understand the importance of this but it can be annoying to hear the same thing over and over again). The tram ride was such a beautiful experience. You really get to see animals up and about which is wonderful as often during the day they are hidden away due to the hot Singapore sun. Definately recommend this safari for all especially animal lovers. I would recommend earlier safari times for children as we were exhausted by the time the tram ride finshed (was just too late of a night for us Kiwi's and Aussies and i am sure that the jet lag didn't help).
,,Super cool!,5.0,,"My husband and I spent the entire day at the zoo and were so exhausted we debated on whether or not to even do the night safari but we pushed through and it was 100% worth it! The night started with fire breathers putting on a show before the gates opened, which was awesome! Once the safari began we quickly realized it was almost impossible to take pictures while on the tram at night with our phones, so we just sat back and enjoyed the show. After you do the night safari by tram you will want to walk around and see everything up close and all through the different pathways. You can get great pictures this way too! Even after spending 10 hours at the zoo previous to doing the night safari we saw things we had never seen before and enjoyed the whole over all experience! My only complaint about the night safari were the people who continued to use the flash on their cameras even after repeatedly being told not to! It really does scare away the animals and it takes away from everyone else's experience. I am giving 2 big thumbs up to the night safari! A must do in Singapore!"
,,Never Again,1.0,,"On this my 3rd visit to the Night Safari, over a period of several years, I could not recommend it to 'seniors'. Reason being the crowds, heat and waiting time to get onto the tram.

We arrived early (wrong thing to do) then had to endure the 'sheep herding lines' for 1.5 hours before boarding a tram for what turned out to be less than 40mins 'tour'

The tram entry lines are hot, sticky, noisy and highly claustrophobic.

No longer a 'must do' attraction for my age group."
,,Can't see anything when you are on the bus,3.0,,"You need to wait for such a long , time , and once you get you , you won't really see much , it is family friendly , but at the same time , it is very boring , after we get off the bus , we tried to walk through it , it is much better , you can see everything , and it is not scary at all , so I suggest you to walk through the whole thing ."
,,Good for young not for old,3.0,,"if you are inside the car, you cannot see much clear. Might be get down and see by trekking. You cannot use the flash if you take pictures."
,,a very new experience at night safari,5.0,,"This tour was so excellent. There are a lot of animals in this zoo
Besides, touring around the zoo at night is very new experience to me.
if you want to have full tour, you should combine taking the train and walking because there are a lot of places where the train cannot go through.
highly recommend tourist to visit this zoo"
,,Good Family Activity,4.0,,"I went here with my wife and 7-year kid back in 2009, and we had a great time. We just went on our own, so we managed our own time to see the things we wanted. It was quite an experience really, but definitely better for the kids. My kid absolutely loved it.

There's a good selection of food too - but queues and waiting time can be quite long, so plan ahead for that.

All in all, a great thing thing to do with the family. Definitely recommended."
,,"Unique experience, be ready for the crowds",4.0,,"Went on a Sunday night in August, was swamped. Pre-booked tickets a must and be ready to queue. That said the tram was a unique experience and one my 13,12, and 8 year olds enjoyed. ""Creatures of the Night"" show was fun. If my kids were a bit older I would make sure to explore the trails and skip the tram lines where were about 30 minutes.

Korean food on the way out was expensive (25 SGD per) but good. Taxi queue was short at 9:30pm."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"It was a good experience and I'm glad that we went, however it is quite pricey and there is A LOT of waiting about. Even if you pre book tickets you still have to wait forever. The train is good but doesn't last that long, but it's nice to wander the trails in the dark."
,,Spectacular Night Safari but book before you go,4.0,,"We made the mistake of not checking ticketing for the Night Safari and found the 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30 sessions sold out. The next night we had on-line bookings but for visitors to Singapore, the on-line booking requires you to proved a mobile phone number and password so see your hotel concierge.

The safari is well conducted and has interesting commentary with a quite wide range of Asian animals but due to its popularity and reputation, be prepared for lines of people and a bit of waiting."
,,Dissapointing,2.0,,"The night we went there were around 6,000 visitors. We were on a tour and we were rushed all night. The train ride past the animals was very dissapointing as it did not stop at any point so even tho you were going slow you only got a quick glimpse. The food was ok but again rushed. The potential is there it's just management of numbers. Check out days and times carefully."
,,Spooky but fun,5.0,,I don't think I would have got off the transport to walk through the zoo at night but a great opportunity to see many animals up close and more active than in the day time. The wait whilst queing for the trams was unbearable in the heat of the evening and the attraction was spoilt by people who ignored the instructions not to use flash photography as it scares the animals and makes it unpleasant for fellow visitors. The guy in front of me finally got the message after being told 5 times!
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I decided to book tickets through a tour company (RMG) and i would recomend others to do so as it allows you to skip the huge ques. However if you're not using a tour I think it best to skip the tram and walk around as you can get closer and look at the animals in your own time, without queing."
,,Be awake with the night animals,5.0,,Very nice experience to take a walk (or drive) in the night safari and watch the night animals go about their business.
,,Ok but not great,3.0,,We booked a tour through our hotel which was a good idea because we got priority entry and avoided the long lines for the tram ride. Saw some animals but overall a little disappointing with the number of animals we could see. Creatures of the night show was ok but not fantastic.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"We have a fabulous time. We did a tour, which included a banquet meal, followed by the ""tram"" tour rambling amongst the exhibits. Because it was night, we saw plenty of animal activity. A very worthwhile activity."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"This was an amazing experience. We did a tour, which included a banquet meal, followed by the ""tram"" tour around the zoo exhibits, which at night, gave the impression that you were in the jungle, with no fences. A very worthwhile tour."
,,"Fun, but put your camera away!",4.0,,"Last week was the 3rd time we had gone through Night Safari. First time was with a tour group, second and third was by ourselves. My recommendation, go to the Singapore Zoo and River Safari first, and buy your Night Safari ticket at that time as well. We did that both times, and had no trouble getting in at the 7:15 opening. I also recommend either trying to get to Creatures of the Night show, or doing a little walking first before boarding the tram. The line is significantly shorter that way. And, for goodness sake, once you pass the gate, put your camera away!!!! Unless you have true night vision on your camera, you're not going to be able to take a picture of anything, and all you're going to do is earn the wrath and ire of other visitors by selfishly taking flash photos. Seriously, almost had someone get thrown off the tram by the other guests for constantly using his flash. Even the staff had to announce multiple times to stop."
,,good way to pass the jet lag!!,5.0,,"A night time Zoo! There is a fire dance that is done by people in tribal outfits before the main event. During the show, we saw exotic animals that we had enevr seen or heard of ever before!"
,,"Enjoyable, touching and a wonderful night",5.0,,"We went there with 2 elderly, 2 kids, my wife and me. My dad having difficulties in walking, 1 sleeping and one running around and one of the friendly staff notice us and give us priority queue for the tram. It really touch us and starts our wonderful night. Laster on, we saw another family with their kid not feeling well and once again, another staff lead then to the first aid station. Lastly the staff there are friendly and caring, they played with our kids, describe to them abt animals and teaches them, both my kids really quiet down and listen to her. The staff there really made our night very enjoyable and wonderful.My kids enjoy a lot and excited about coming back again. Thank you to all the friendly staff and we'll be back again."
,,Dissapointment visit,3.0,,"Place is too crowded, long lines and was very stuffy. We waited for more than an hour in the line and then get on the train but nothing much to see as it's too dark or no sign of animals."
,,Not worth to see..,2.0,,"I was expected to see how animals hunting during night or something like that but what I saw, was some asleep animals, and others did anything that do during day. But in dark environment. I recommend you to get normal zoo ticket."
,,A must do!,5.0,,A must do in Singapore but to avoid the long lines book with a tour operator. We enjoyed the guided team ride to see the nocturnal animals as well as a great fire dance show - sit in the bongo restaurant for a great view.
,,Loved the elephants....,4.0,,"Access - took the tube and then hooked up with number 138 bus at the depot over the road from the tube station using our 3 day tourist pass (cost $20) so no issues getting their. Bus ride ends at the night safari access point. Taxi would be quicker if you are happy to pay extra.
The activity itself was thoroughly enjoyable with a good range of animal to view and good commentary along the way. No flash on cameras allowed which is understandable. Better to sit back and enjoy the ride.
Expect queues but boarding system efficient and found the queues moved reasonably quickly.
Food outlets available at beginning and end of the safari as well as usual souvineer stands.
Great experience and worth doing of an evening."
,,one of a kind experience,5.0,,"this was our first time to a safari especially in the night. it turned out to be an interesting visit though. you can actually visit all the animals quite closeby in their natural surroundings. even though its dark u can actually see the animals well only tat ur are not allowed to take pictures using flash.here too, as in other places the queues can be quite long especially during holidays. but takes nothing more than 15-20 mins. or you can even walk through the various trails to get a better view.
there is the tribal dance kind of entertainment program outside the safari area which is interesting too. the animal show is also good. the voice over in english during the tram ride is informative. what bothered me was how the animals managed to stay in the confined place which was definetly not anything like their natural habitat."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Best experience was sitting in a tram and closely observing the animals. Overall experience of a jungle was fantastic. Could not see the show because of rain.
,,Night Zoo for Transit,4.0,,"The Night Safari is located right next to the zoo. Actually, it is just a night zoo. It was our first time to go to the zoo at night so it was interesting. We had a great time. It took about 35 minutes from the airport. Taxi fare was $25 during non peak hours. We arrived at 6pm to get dinner and then lined up to get in for our 7:15 entrance time. This allowed us to watch the 7pm fire show right in front of the entrance. We were able to get on the first tram as well and then went to the 8:30 creatures of the night show after we walked around. Don't forget your bugs repellent. The food and drinks are 3x higher than outside. Overall, it was a nice transit experience."
,,"Ok-ok, not for a long day's night out",3.0,,"For tourists, I suggest to put your visit in a day that isn't so packed with other itineraries. Also, it is not recommended for toddlers and babies. The nights in Singapore can be hot and humid, the kids turn up to be impatient and noisy. (Be considerate to fellow tourists.) Riding the tram with children and parents making all sorts of noise will definitely ruin the sight-seeing, as the animals tend to be startled. The kids will also have a very hard time spotting the animals. Better bring the children to Jurong Bird Park or the Singapore Zoo for a more educational view of the animals.

Don't go here if you are not prepared to queue at most 1h for the 40 min tram ride that guides you throughout the safari. Also, make sure you tend to your belongings at all times.

Enjoy the show: Creatures of the Night and walk to see the animals up close if the tram queue is taking very long."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"-- We have selected Zoo and night Safari on same day so it was kind of tiring for families with young kids.
-- Although there were too many people and long queue but still we got into the tram in 30-40 mins
-- Overall it was nice to move around in dark and feeling the jungle atmosphere but we were not able to see much.
-- Fire show before the ride was good"
,,Really bad,1.0,,First let me say I visited as part of a tour. HUGE mistake. Hours of waiting pick ups coach parks and more waiting for 25 mins on a tram looking at animals in the semi darkness who are mostly sleeping. Waste of time and money. Also no time allowed to really do any of the walking trails. And the Creatures of the Night show was awful. Poor animals. Would recommend visiting in the day independently at your own pace. You probably get to see more animals this way.
,,"Always impressed by the night safari, animal show was not so great though",4.0,,Having visited previously many years ago I was excited to go again. The tram ride around seeing the various animals at night is really one of the good experiences one must have in their life. I feel it is unique. The animal show creatures of the night was not impressive and can be skipped.
,,World's First Night Zoo,4.0,,"Every trip to this place brings a different experience. The animal show is worth watching and if you are lazy or too tired to explore the place on foot, do consider taking the tram. It's nice to plan and go to the Safari after the Day Zoo, since they are within the same area."
,,Unique experience but be prepared for a ridiculous amount of queueing! :),3.0,,"There is no doubt that the Night Safari offers an unique experience where you get to take a tram safari after dark and see some incredible nocturnal animals in motion. However, be prepared for a lot of queueing and I mean A LOT. The first timed entry is at 7.15pm (buy your tickets by the end of the afternoon as this slot gets sold out quickly), which I went on. I arrived at the Night Safari entrance around 6pm on a Saturday after finishing my Singapore Zoo adventures and a long queue had already formed almost out the door! There was a fire breathing show on by the entrance queue but because of the huge crowds of people and the trees in the way I didn't get to see much of it.

Once I finally got in, I immediately headed to the Creatures of the Night show, which was very cool to watch, but be warned you are not allowed any flash photography as you could damage the vision of some animals. There was a sign saying that this show would be cancelled whenever it rains so if the weather forecast is rain for the evening you plan on coming here, I would recommend choosing another date for your visit. You definitely need to bring some mosquito spray as there are mozzies about waiting to snack on some tasty humans.

Once the show had finished, I had to queue for over an hour to join a tram safari so was a bit exhausted after all the queueing up till then. I was slightly underwhelmed by the safari part as the tram drove by the animals slightly too quickly and I didn't get long to enjoy the sights of the nocturnal animals. There is an option to skip the tram ride and just walk around designated parts of the park at your leisure, which in hindsight I would have probably enjoyed more. It is worth visiting the Night Safari though for the unique experience! :)"
,,Fun,4.0,,"We came to the night zoo 5 years ago and it was the highlight of our trip, 5 years later it is still out of this world.

Rated one down as an Ice Cream cost me $14 from the place out front, now that's taking advantage of tourists"
,,Rip Off !,1.0,,"Very expensive, bad food, extremely long lines . I've been to a real safari and this is not even 20 % as good as a regular african safari !"
,,Sounds ordinary but it is fabulous,4.0,,This us not just a night zoo and whoever put this together is brilliant. We spent 4 hours here and the time just flew. It is such a fabulous experience seeing and hearing these amimals though this experience. We loved it.
,,interesting,4.0,,one of the many interesting things the city of Singapore has on offer. decent enough to have a look at
,,Underwhelmed,2.0,,"I was looking forward to this experience but I was disappointed. The live show was quite good( the best thing out of a hot night) but the trolley ride in the dark to see the animals was, as I said underwhelming. The animals were difficult to see due to the foliage and the fact they were often at the back of the enclosure. You have to queue for the tickets and it feels a bit frenzied to get there early and can be very busy.
Its also quite along way from the city centre so if you don't have a car it does take time getting there and back.

While I would not disregard it as a family outing, just consider the time and money before you choose this attraction an option. Also because is starts late and finishes later,and its hot, not always the best combination for young kids that have had a long day."
,,Overpriced and underwhelming.,2.0,,"The concept is very good. A safari in Asia. Unfortunately, the ""night"" concept is really not working. The animals are asleep (rhino, bear, lion, hyenas, etc.) and cannot be seen. Also, when it's too dark you can only see the outline of the animals and with the no-flash rule, you can't really take a picture. I also think the variety of animals are small (they have deer and more deer). The safari also has a portion where you will alight the tram in the middle of the tour then check out other animals while walking (nobody wants to leave because the people are not sure if it's worth the trip and if they can come back and continue the tour). I think it would be better if there is a separate tour for that.

The show afterwards was very underwhelming. The animals were having a mutiny and not following the instructions of the instructor. They showed about six animals, four of them did not do well, one of them is passive (snake), and only one of them succeeded (the otter).

The price of over 40 SGD is too much for this activity."
,,Go to the latest session,4.0,,"Brilliant, once we were in, the queues are a nightmare for 7:15 and 8:15, I would go to the 9:15 one far less crowded, and cooler. We walked all of the routes rather than queue (again) for the trams, and you see much more. All the animals appear in completely natural surroundings."
,,Night fun,4.0,,"We did the night safari as part of a zoo multi pass, was an interesting night. The lines to get in are abit of a joke. People everywhere. We rushed into see the first show of the night. Was ok but nothing special and was the same routine as one of the shows in the zoo during the day time. Dont think I'd waste my time with this show.

The lines to get on the trams were long so we did all the walking parts first, got to see animal being feed and speak to the keepers which was really good. We did the tram ride last which takes you too areas that are open with animals right next to the road and was a better way to end the night safari.

Not sure what the cost is on it's own, but as part of a multi pass was a good experience, thou doing the zoo, night and river safari on one day was a big day."
,,What could be fantastic was overpriced & involved a long time queuing.,3.0,,"Having done the night safari several years ago, I was excited to return with my 6 year old daughter and my mother. I booked online which received a 10% discount however the tickets still totalled $108. On arrival we had to negotiate 45 minutes (or more) waiting time to take the tram around the park. The animals that we saw were an abundance of deer of several 'varieties' with a few star 'attractions' thrown in on occasion. Sadly neither the giraffes nor the zebras were 'available' which was not communicated prior to booking. It was certainly underwhelming and the focus on restaurants and gift shops towards the exit was more than we had on any animals that we looked forward to seeing. What a shame as it was such a good experience on my last visit."
,,Good Concept,4.0,,"After a long queue enjoyed Tram ride, animal show was not too interesting. overall it was a good experience."
,,Fun experience - different from a normal zoo,5.0,,First of its kind. Timed entry - 7.15 (first entry) gets sold out quickly - we went at 8.15 and all was fine. Walked first and used the tram later to see some parts that you can't see on foot. Animals close to the tram and easy to see.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A great activity to do in Singapore. We all loved it. Got very close to the animals which was awesome. It is a long way out from the city centre. We went by train and then bus. We wanted to catch the first show which was 7.15pm. Unfortunately it was sold out by 6.30ish so you need to be out there at least an hour earlier and if you are travelling by public transport, give yourself 2 hours. Made for quite a late night but still worth it."
,,OVERATED and OVER-PRICED!!!!,1.0,,"So bad and overpriced that my girlfriend was apologizing to me because it was her idea to go. The ONLY bright spot of this $45 (EACH) attraction was the Animal Night Show..that has only 4 shows a night and gets sold out. And, just when you begin enjoying the show....it is over! The introductions and instructions phase was equal in length to the show itself. Even after the guy said no flash or spotlight photos (in five languages) still, TWO idiots did it anyway. With the wait in line for the tram, not that there is much to see, I was always looking at my watch so not to miss the bus...keeping in mind the travel time on the MRT to the city as well. If taking mass transportation...get there before the first show to make it worthwhile....or better yet....just give this a miss. You are NOT missing anything!!!"
,,Different Experience,4.0,,It's a quite difference experience . I was very excited about Night Safari but were not able to see much as expected . There was quite queue for tram . Also some shows after Safari were very good and worth watching . I think it is worth giving a visit once.
,,Great experience which I'd do again,4.0,,"This is definitely worth the visit.. When i first saw the word ""night"" I really thought it would be night.. But since in Singapore the night starts form 7pm on.. its more like an evening Safari ;)

It is totally worth the visit and see many nocturnal animals in a kind of natural environment. You wont be able to take pictures as flash is totally forbidden to not disturb the animals but its better that way - just enjoy and live the experience!

We had booked a skip-the-line tour in advance and it was the best decision taken as the crowds queueing were vast! After the safari, there are some shows with fire and one with animals both really fun to watch!

You can also have dinner there if youi like there are some Cafes and restaurants as well.

All in all I didn't regret it for a moment!"
,,Loved it and would have stayed longer!,5.0,,"Takes some planning to get there (metro and bus) so we were too late but no worries, we could walk right in past the queue. Too long waiting time for the tram and too many tourists talking inatead of watching. Having said that, it was very interesting to see the night animals. I was a bit worried that the noise and light would disturb the animals but the seemed to be healthy and in good shape. So I can definitely recommend this experience for familie with animal interested kids. My youngest (11 years old) was sad to leave because even though we had spent almost 4 hours there, we had not seen everything."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"We heard a lot about the night Safari and how cool it would be. Even though we did get too see several different types of deer, there wasn't a big variety of animals to look at. Most of the animals weren't active as well. It was cool to see the elephants and the rhino. However most of the animals just stayed put and you didn't get to see much for what they had to offer. Also, the photo booth closed before we got done with the tram ride so we never even got to view our photo."
,,The worst experience ever,1.0,,"This was the worst activity I have had in a 2 week trip to Indonesia & Singapore. In fact one of the worst ever. So you queue for about 50 mins to buy your ticket, then queue for another 1hr until eventually you get into the tram. All this in 30c terribly humid, in heavy crowds, with no air conditioning, just a few fans.

Then the tram ride through the zoo shows a dozen different animals, most of which were asleep or looked dazed/ drugged. It may as well have been called the madam tussauds safari, as most animals looked like waxworks.

Really really can't stress enough not to waste your time going, we have only 2 nights in Singapore & I can't believe we wasted one on this activity, gutted."
,,A good concept but not totally appropriate for us,3.0,,"We had to travel a fair way to get here.
I must admit the buffet food was excellent.
We then went on a train to take us round the nocturnal animals.
This was really good but my wife was unable to see very well so was not really suited to this.I also had difficulty picking out the animals which clearly had their food strategically placed with a view to make them visible.
What we found particularly off-putting was the fact that on many occasions we were all told in no uncertain terms NOT to take any pictures with flashlights as this could damage the eyes of the nocturnal animals.Despite this people persisted in doing this,which was a real distraction,apart from the most important consideration that the animals might be harmed.This was not policed well and it should have been made clear that if there were further incidences the offenders would be asked to leave immediately.
We were not really impressed with the 'show' for which we had to queue for some time.
Perhaps I am being too critical but it was not really our 'cup of tea'.
However this is personal only and clearly many people enjoy the whole evening and should not be put off from going
The children there seemed really to enjoy the whole evening,however."
,,A novel way to visit a zoo,4.0,,"Good experience for a 7 year old. Slightly chaotic to get on one of the little buses but found by walking round for a while to begin with, the queues had quietened down. Animal show was ok - not sure about pretending a snake had escaped! Nearly had a stampede by the audience."
,,Unbelievable experience,5.0,,It was unbelievable to see the animals around you. It was a beautiful experience and I recommend everyone to must visit night safari if they are planning to come to singapore in near future.
,,Average,3.0,,Down side of the visit here was the poor ticketing a total shambles to many variations of ticket purchase and then waiting for tickets to be sorted printed and sign for tickets time you stream lined your ticket process very average way to start the night and so many rude tour operators barging through ticket line thinking they are the only people there once in 45 min wait for tram ride through park highlight of the night getting on the 915 bus to leave
,,Night safari after visiting zoo,4.0,,We opted for the 7.15 one but huge crowd was there for the same...so better opt for the later ones and have dinner before going in so that once ur done with the safari and the show u can head home.
,,It's good,5.0,,Reached at there before time till 5 pm Always every day busy But waiting is worth Fire show is Totally cool and outstanding
,,Definitely not to be missed,5.0,,"We went to Singapore in July for our anniversary and decided to go for the famous night safari. It's a great concept and the animals are really marvellous. I was a little scared when I saw the hyaenas and the Indian wolves in their natural environment. The only difficulty we faced was the longgggg que. We close the 9pm slot and even though we got there at 8.30pm, we didn't actually sat in the tram till 10pm. I would advise choosing the last slot as by then the tourist crowd is dying. There are tons of eating options there so one can just get there and grab dinner. It's better to buy your tickets online or through an agent before as the lines can get very long especially if it's a weekend."
,,Good experience,3.0,,"If you haven't done it, it is worth it to see the nocturnal animals really come to life. We saw the show, which again if you haven't seen it, worth it but I would see it again. We then took off on the walking trails where you could see the animals quite close. When we got back from our walk, which took just over an hour. The tram line was crazy, so we left. It did mean we didn't see the African Animals at night but the line was well over an hour and a half."
,,Awesome! A must do experience,5.0,,"Absolutely loved our time at the night safari, as did the kids. So many animals are visible, unlike many zoos where they are hiding somewhere asleep. The 'show' was terrible though, which is good news for you because it's packed! Use this time to jump on the tram with less people & queues. The rest of the time take to the walking trails. You need to do both to see all the animals. Also, the Singaporean food at the back of the eating area was surprisingly good."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,This is definitely worth visiting when in Singapore. It is unique and so cool to see animals awake at night. Skip the tram in the beginning and walk the park. The lines are crazy when the park first opens. You can always ride the tram when you circle the park once. I believe the last one departs 30 min before the park closes.
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,one and only safari which opens only at night . its very adventurous and amazing experience to see wild life in night . They have all kind of entertainment program like bird show etc...... Must go destination if you are in singapore. You can watch the animal in all natural night light without disturbing them. A different experince
,,Night Safari....Good to do,4.0,,"This attraction is a ""good to do"" in Singapore. Travelled in May 2016, was a bit late for the safari (last tram to leave the main station). As a couple and animal lover, was nice to see the animals at night. All the animals, were kept in a very naturalistic habitat and not in cages, so thats the plus here. I would strongly advise to go early and if you are up for walking, do a bit of the park via foot. There are rangers almost everywhere. Although folks travelling with young kids should keep the kids informed about noise and disturbing the animals (the park is SAFE!!).
If you are an animal enthusiast, it is a must go just to appreciate the beautiful animals in their night life."
,,Too crowded and boring,2.0,,"I stay in Singapore for the last 10 years so have been coming here a few times.
The most recent time was last weekend and it was terrible.

It's packed with tourists from 7pm until 10pm+. Queues take at least 40-50 minutes. It's a people-safari because you cannot see any other animals.

The ""Night Creature"" show is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. It used to be longer and more fun, with more acts and really like a show. Now, there's a lot of talking, 3 acts in which some animals would come out and go back in. it lasts for 15 minutes. It's a waste of time!!

If you haven't been, can try once.
If you have been, don't go back.
Be prepared to queue a lot.
If you have young children on the baby pram, please don't bring them there. It's humid, hot crowded, the kids will cry and cry the whole time and it's very uncomfortable for them."
,,Last time probably,2.0,,"This was about our 10th visit over the last 18 years and probably our last.

Little has been done to modernise the attraction. It still retains a uniqueness that makes it a key attraction but for us it has lost its charm. This loss has been caused by it being a victim of its own success. Tour packages and general sales have clearly taken off. Significant foreign visitors from China, India and Arab countries have forced a four slot timed entry programme from 7.15 at hourly intervals. The shows (which last 15 minutes) are full about 25 minutes before they start (7.30, 8.30, 9.30 and 10.30pm) and that is with about an 800 seat amphitheatre.

Opportunities for people to interact with animals are almost non-existent. For instance only two of the general public at the show get to interact with any animals at all. How difficult would it be to set up a snake handling area for instance for before and after the show.

The staff seem not to be well drilled to optimise the publics experience and the sight of half-filled tour trains sailing past when you are queuing is quite galling. On the tour trains the diction is clearer than the somewhat charming Singlish that used to prevail. There are still some remnants to keep those linguistically inclined on their toes as they await the next hyaena (such as the incorrect use of matured (past participle) instead of mature).

The commercial edge has grown also and that has also eroded the charm.

On a positive note there are discounts for under 12s, over 60s and Singaporean residents if you book online.

Sorry there are no photos as flash photography is banned pretty well everywhere."
,,Fantastic Night Viewing,5.0,,We really enjoyed the night viewing and saw many animals active at night that one wouldn't normally see. Light rail goes around the park and you hop on or off at various locations to see the different attractions. Really enjoyable evening.
,,DO NOT GO IF YOU HAVE A HEART,1.0,,"We decided to go here after reading about it and thinking it would be a different thing to experience. However we were so wrong.

The animal care is not the priority the organisation is solely focused on making money.

Hundreds of people gathered in an overly touristy complex where by people are shuffled into buses and taken around a very strategically build 'safari park' animals have no room to go anywhere or roam free, we were expecting animals to be able to naturally go about there business and we'd stumble across some amazing creatures however food piles were left at the front of their small patch of land in order to ensure animals were in site. Anyone who looked closely could see the electric fences that went round to show they really didn't have room to move.

It was a shame people abused the rule to keep quiet and avoid using flashes on there cameras as it was evidently frightening the animals. We found this to be very disrespectful and make us feel even worse for them.

This goes on from 7pm - 11pm with a constant stream of buses distracting the animals sleeping patterns, which clearly would be distressful for any being whether it be a human or an animal."
,,Probably better for younger kids,3.0,,"There was a lot of hype so we went in with big expectations. Other reviewers are correct- 45 min wait, at best. Either get there early (6:30) and wait for 45 min or get there at 7:15, and wait 45 min (general admission). The entire attraction is the tram tour. It lasts around 40 min and is pleasant but there's not a lot to see. We're originally from the U.S. so we don't find deer and raccoons to be exotic. We've also been to lots of zoos and such so we don't get overly excited about elephant, hyena, or lions. That's nearly all the animals they have. It's neat that the animals appear unrestrained but by 8:30pm they were all going to sleep anyway. Left side of tram seemed to have more up-close experiences with the animals. Take a left when departing the tram to go to the show at the amphitheatre (instead of being hoarded into the restaurant by staff). The show is for little kids and is short and sweet with a goofy style. It wasn't an awful experience and my 11 year old seemed to enjoy it. The 14 yr old didn't get excited about it nor did the adults. If you're short on time then skip it but if you have time to kill them you might as well do it."
,,Definitely avoidable,2.0,,This is one of the few attractions in Singapore that is a big let down. It is perplexing how this is one of the most popular attractions. There are endless queues for the tram and 'Creatures of the Night' show and while the actual tram ride is decent the show is a big let down.
,,"Wow, what an amazing end to the day!",5.0,,"What an amazing end to a busy day.
This is truly an awesome place!
The queues at the beginning are lengthy and you need to be patient.
Try to book the early ticket 1915 to get the first slot for the trams
Outside area opens from 1730 and we had some food and a refreshing drink before we waited for the park to open.
Food and drink options are plentiful as are the gift shops
The toilets are amazing, it's was like being in the rainforest!
Once on the tram it is a slow journey into the unknown. Don't follow the map or take photos as I think the best way is to explore and experience first hand what is round the next corner. It is like you are on a journey through the actual rainforest and not a zoo!
Cannot recommend enough!
Well worth the visit"
,,Zoo and animals great. Fire eaters outrageous,3.0,,"We booked tickets, and it appeared 9:15 pm was the only night option. It is sold ""cheap"" by a couple of $. We could have gone earlier. When you arrive you are directed to an area where there will be ""dancers"" and you can get something to eat or drink. We chose warm overly sweet Singapore Slings. Should have had a cold beer or water.
The dancers were 3 young men. Who twirled fire sticks. They then spent about 20 mins drinking and spraying kerosine, which busty into flame. This is very dramatic, but very unhealthy. Singapore is highly regulated. I am surprised this got past health and safety. I was left breathless from the concentration of kero in the air. I wonder what the ""dancers"" lung capacity will be like when they turn 30.
The train ride thru the animals was great. We did not see everyone but quite a lot.
Solosydney"
,,A Special Experience,5.0,,"Believe me - this is very different than the day zoo. It's a memory you won't forget . Riding the tram and seeing the glow of the animals' eyes and watching some of them moving around the dark up close to the tram is such fun. I'm a science teacher and wish I could bring everyone of my students on this special visit .
We even went to the bird show and that was especially fun for children and most of the grownups ,too !"
,,great night activity,5.0,,"great for children (although the night hours) but also for adults.
it is great that the animals are in open enclousers (except for the tigers and lions). It feels like you are walking right next to the animals. public transit to the night safari is not very comfortable. I recommend taking the private bus shuttle to and from there, if you don't want to take a taxi or buplic bus in late night hours."
,,You need to be patient!,4.0,,"The queue to get in was overwhelming. You then had to wait to get on the tram...waited over one hour. Once on board the safari was worth the wait however it was difficult to see some of the animals as it was dark. You cannot use a flash as it scares the animals so leave your camera and mobile in your bag. Plenty of taxis to take you home if you leave before 9pm,"
,,Best wildlife experience,5.0,,"At the entrance of the park, you will really feel the wildlife atmosphere. Since we took the tram ride, it was an unforgettable experience you really get to see the animals uncaged and see how they are in their environment. Inside the trail is a no flash camera policy, and people really need to respect that because it hurts the eyes of the animals. I suggest that visitors just should enjoy what they see and not be concerned about taking photos with flashes. Its definitely okay to take pictures but just remove the flash. There are a lot of places where to use the flash of the camera outside the trail and thats what we did. This park lets visitors be aware that we need to protect what our world has for us for the coming generations."
,,Family fun in the night!,5.0,,Had a great time at Night Safari with my family. Brought my parents as well. Thank you for taking extra care for my elderly and all of your staff are so welcoming!
,,These animals are wannabe Hollywood stars.,5.0,,"If you thought Singapore couldn't possibly surprise you anymore, this place just about does it. First of all, the wait at the ticket counter can be quite long. And then the wait to get in is even longer. So, arrive well fed and hydrated. Once you enter the safari, however, things get impressive very quickly. Just as you enter a tiger exhibit, the tiger walks by to show its might. A fruit bat just about plays its part in sucking the nectar off of hanging fruit as if it was choreographed. Chimps sleep on each other as if they are being paid for a still painting. Oh, when you are done with the safari, go to the Ulu Ulu safari restaurant and get the Chili crab. You can thank me later."
,,Must See,5.0,,"One of the great night safari in the world, have different experienced by seeing the wild animals at night. A must visit tourist site."
,,"Average experience, boring tour",3.0,,"I felt that Night Safari is a bit of overhype, having a lot of expectation. It was just too dark in the night and wasn't be able to see much. The trail, which I did not walk as my wife said it could be dangerous. Should have done the River Safari instead.

Also not to mention the long queue in NS, and the 20 shows is just boring and not exciting. A bit regret waste time going here."
,,A cooler option/ Major attraction for Night visitors,5.0,,"The Night safari is also a must visit for a walk in better lower temperature averaging 24 to 27 degrees than the Zoo in the Day where temperatures averages 30 to 33 degrees depending on month of visit. There are quite a few indoors enclosures with fans and aircon comfort if you start to feel the heat.
If you hate walking, tram services are available with a few stops along the way for your own pleasure. Look out for some ""live show times"" that are very very interesting and amusing too for your delightful visit.
Entrance fees and tram services are chargeable. Food & beverage available with various choices. It is advisable to follow protocol when you are in the Safari."
,,Really??,3.0,,"We went to Singapore for my husband business purpose for couple of days and we took a along our children because they have summer vacations.
Therefore we had no plans to go anywhere accept to universal Studios and the rest just strolling around the city. However we made plan to to night Safari since some people said it was good.
Ok the we go buy ticket at the hotel, the next day got pick up by the tour company and we are on our way to night safari ( it took the bus for 45 mins to arrive) the journey was nice to see other side of Singapore (not only shopping and shopping town) then we arrive at the place...now we have our guide in a group of 12 pax.
We expected something more from this night safari...how ever it's disappointed since we can't see many animal around. Even they offer us to walk around the park...we could not do it because the timing is really tight...then we go back to hotel. One of my daughter got really upset because she can't buy one animal t shirt...because we had not enough time :("
,,Nice little tram ride for family,4.0,,"The park opens from 7pm. We ate at Purvis street for dinner and hop on a cab to the night safari on a monday evening around 8pm.
Crowded and long line to wait for the tram, over 20 min wait. The tram rides for around 30min, see different animals, pretty much like the zoo at daytime. Sit in for a night creature show which is fun.

Left around 10ish, not many people in line for cabs."
,,Great evening activity!,5.0,,"The night safari was great , not just a night zoo with animals in enclosures. Some were roaming around freely!! It was an enjoyable experience for both adults and kid. There were a lot of tourists, the place was jam-packed, but overall, crowd control was well done."
,,Terrific,4.0,,"Lovely trip around the zoo by boat and tram, seeing nocturnal animals freely going about their business. Also great fire eating display beforehand."
,,Loved the night safari,5.0,,A little chaotic with our hotel to bus transfer and the park itself is sooo busy but we so enjoyed it. The tram ride was fun and exciting to be so close to the animals and we really enjoyed our walk afterwards. Dinner there was excellent.
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,One of the best night safari in Asia with live demonstration and various behavioural patterns of animals on night hunt for food. Entertaining and Enjoyable.
,,A Perfectly Good Attraction Ruined,1.0,,"This attraction was terrific 14 years ago and even 3 years ago but now it's an absolute disgrace and an attraction for us that has been taken off our not to be missed list, to avoid at all costs.

Drove family who had purchased combo tickets at the Jurong Bird Park only to find that they now have to select an arrival time several days before going to this attraction. Who on holidays wants to be strictly regimented. And maybe if the time meant smooth travel through the attraction it could be forgiven but it doesn't.

The ticket had been put through wrong for a same day ticket even though it read to be used several days later on the Monday at 8.15. They also were told at Jurong Bird Park that this time was flexible but it wasn' so they had to wait and line up with throngs of other frustrated people just to get in the door, stifling traffic flow and causing copious bottle necks. I would hate to see this on a weekend which we didn't do trying to avoid this scenario.

Next the lines of people were outrageous and the mood was chaotic and embarrassing, since we'd said how good it was. WAS is the word here.

Food here used to be good and fairly reasonably priced, now it is a total tourist 'rip off'. Hawker meals that usually are $5 to $7 were $22. A crappy burger with cold fries were $18, add a drink and you see it at nearly $30 a head. I used to get satay here for about $12! Now no satay and no decent food, even the hawker rip off was really bad quality. And seating was a nightmare. Now you expect a 100% mark up on food for a tourist attraction that's just a given, but a 400% is highway robbery.

I am told that lines of people continued once they messed around with sorting out their tickets and got in the door as it was obvious that they had over sold the 7.15 crowd. Lines, lines and lines. Really a very bad ending to a good trip to Singapore and having witnessed the crowd at entering I totally believe it. I was intending to go and join them but there was no way given what I saw we would go.

Whoever now runs this is not doing anyone a favour by cramming everyone in and overselling and not focusing on a quality product, which it used to be. Very poor execution. Yes, I am quite annoyed at the waste of precious time that was wasted here.

Buyer beware."
,,Spectacular evening!,5.0,,"Visited the night safari a few nights ago, suffice to say I was not disappointed.

As you enter there is a queue for the tram to take you around the park, however, you are presented with the option to take the walking trails. In my experience, I would suggest taking the walking trails first and thereafter returning to the tram when it's a bit quieter - ultimately saving you some time later in the evening.

The animals truly do come to life at night, we saw the lions running around and playing with each other. The tiger was right up and the spectator's window staring down everyone and the elephants were roaming around and giving us quite the show!

Best of it's kind in my opinion.

I highly recommend the night safari if you are looking for an amazing get up close animal experience and a great alternate to a day visit at the zoo!"
,,Interesting Trip,4.0,,Maybe not the only nite time Zoo trip in the world but really interesting. Surprising number of animals are nocturnal & well organized.
,,Perfect,5.0,,"Went to the night safari on a Monday night and it was packed.
I must admit I was a bit unsure how much we were going to see however I am happy to say it was well worth it kids loved it.
I would suggest organising the tour from your hotel that way there is no long lines to wait in."
,,Visit,4.0,,It's a lovely place with lots of different species of animals some of which I ve never seen or heard of before. I just feel sorry for the animals as they are confined to limited area and can't be free.
,,Amazing evening,5.0,,"We loved this night safari and stayed there from 7pm until midnight when it closed even with 2 young kids. My recommendation if you are an animal lover and want to avoid crowds is:
1. But 7.15 ticket. Sit down, have dinner and drink while you watch fire show at front of zoo
2. Enter zoo when crowds are dying down prob 7.40
3. Upon entry avoid the busy trams and do all the amazing walking tracks. This took us until the last show of the evening
4. Watch final show I think it was 10.30pm. If you sit at front you might get chosen to go up on stage like my daughter who met a binturong.
5. After the show do the tram at around 11.15 or so (we were the last team and it was pretty empty)
This meant we had a nice quiet time everywhere. Several friends I have spoken too didn't enjoy it as much because they just got there, stood in long queues for the tram then left. We did have a Slight panic when we left at midnight and there were no taxis but one came within 10 minutes. This was a really special night!"
,,Good attraction but avoid weekend,4.0,,"We went to night Safari on Friday night and the park was fully packed with people. We took 8.15 Tram and we have to wait for more than an hour to get on the the Tram. Avoid weekend trip if possible

The journey took about 40 minutes with commentary in English. We have choice to get off the Tram on station 3 and walk around along the trails so that we feel more intimate with the animal. When we feel tired we can get back on the Tram. We didn't do this as we all already tired after a day strolling in Orchard Road. Lol."
,,A Worthy Visit,4.0,,I really felt this was a worthy visit...seeing animals normally in day light is usual...this was very different...the tram ride was very informative and the pre shows were also very nice... Walking trails were there for the brave ones!!
,,Not the best when busy,3.0,,"We were really looking forward to the night zoo, but it was crazy busy from line up to get in to the very end when we decided to leave.
It took about 20 minutes just to get into the zoo and line behind us was massive.
We did manage to see 1 show and that was it! The lines for the trams were huge, so we decided to walk around to see the animals. I am sure we missed more than half the zoo.
For us it was a big disappointment and really not worth the effort! We much preferred the Singapore Zoo and River Safari.
Maybe if it hadn't been so busy would have enjoyed the night much better."
,,Good for kids,3.0,,When we went on the night Safari we found that a lot of he animals were either sleeping or not visible site. There are so long to ques but it depends on what time you getting there. They have a show which the animals they along with which lasts for approximately 30 minutes. I would recommend this venue for parents with their children looking to pass time in the evenings.
,,Nightmare Safari,1.0,,"Greetings Readers, Salty and Mrs Kroc are here in Singapore for a winter break from shaking down Australian Bogans for the bank to take in the spectacular flowers at the Garden Festival. We thought that we would also pay a visit to the night safari having been to the Singapore Zoo previously during the day and really enjoyed ourselves. This outstanding institution is at the vanguard of animal conservation, and particularly of the many endangered primates in this part of the world.

However, I can only describe our interaction with the night safari as an unmitigated disaster and an almost complete waste of $100. Things began well enough, we booked an online tour with City Tours figuring this would be the easiest way to get out to the zoo from where we are staying on Orchard Road. This was simple enough, and we had a good start with the shuttle van collecting us promptly at 5:45pm. We spent the next 40 minutes weaving our way through various neighbourhoods, stopping and waiting for patrons who never bothered to turn up. Eventually, we got down to the Singapore Flyer at 6:20pm. This seems like a long ride,but then we waited another 15 minutes for a shuttle driver to arrive and collect the 8 of us who had bothered to turn up.

Here began yet a stranger odyssey as, despite having a full van, we weaved our way through downtown streets stopping at two more hotels, where our second driver disembarked and engaged in animated discussions with staff at these hotels after which he returned to the car and eventually got us on the PIE to Lake Mandai. I have no idea way we made these stops,though it cost us another 20 minutes in delays, and I found it most amusing the fellow who was accosted at the last hotel seemed to be the doorman who was dressed in such an outrageous tuxedo and bow tie that I thought he was an extra from a Jackie Chan movie. It takes a debt collector to know a debt collector and my suspicion is that if some bills aren't paid soon, then someone is going to have a very bad day indeed!

Back to tho zoo. We eventually got there at 7:40, two hours after leaving the hotel. Here we waited another 40 minutes with other irate customers in line 4 of the ticketing window to redeem our on-line ticket, which wasn't really a ticket but a voucher for a ticket that could only be redeemed for an available show ticket. So despite having ""tickets"" for the 7:30 tour we wound up with tickets to the 9:15 admission. The length of the queue to enter was astounding. You would have thought that it was an exodus from some war torn hell hole.

This left us both speechless as we needed to be back on the bus home by 9:45 for the reverse two hour trip. I noted that we were not alone in our frustration. So we had an ice cream, kissed our $100 good bye and considered it a donation to the poor inmates, and walked down to catch a cab, which had us back on Orchard road in twenty minutes. It was the worst experience that we have ever had here and the most uncharacteristic. We can't recommend the night safari or city tours to anyone. My next safari will by to watch Tarzan in the theatre. At least I might actually get in to the theatre.

Happy Travels, Salty"
,,visit tigers and leopards,4.0,,"We stayed at hotel near the river and thought it would be arround 45 min travel by public transport (we had a touristpass). it was about 1,5h. The night safari was fun, but expensive as everything in Singapore. The fire show was hot and impressive. everything is well organised. Some animals looked a bit stressed. Book tickets in advance on the website, you have to pick an hour. We left the zoo at around 11h. We took the bus and one part of the metro but than got stuck because the green line stopped for that day. We have found a taxi and had to pay the late night surcharge (50%), but it was not to expensive.
Our daughter loved it all. We felt a bit rushed (our entry ticket was from 21h, we taught this was for the train, but this wasn't the case, we think that we could have come earlier) to see everything we liked."
,,Uncaged!,4.0,,"A beautiful zoo where the animals are free to roam around. All animals are ungaged except for the tigers which was kept behind a glass shield. The Night Safari is an excellent experience, and once you are on the tram, you can sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.

The only sad part of this tour was no flash photography and therefore no good photos of the tour"
,,Chaotic,3.0,,"The evening we went the organisation to actually get in more or less broke down. Queuing was not possible as just to many were trying to get in and most were prepared to barge their way forward.
Once in getting on to transport was again hit and miss.
But worse still, we saw virtually no animals.
Waste of time and money in our case"
,,Most enjoyable,5.0,,"This was unexpected. Loved it, did not want it to end. Lots of animals quietly enjoying the early evening calm, slightly cooler temps. Lots of crowds at beginning though. If you booked for 715 entry, start queuing early, like 630! Entertaining show too that is on at 730 and 830. We did show first at 730, but you could do it after safari."
,,Fab zoo,4.0,,"Arrived late afternoon because we wanted to do night safari. Very hot. We did River Safari exhibit mainly for pandas which were disappointing actually. Only one of the two was on display, but crowds were minimal so we could stay as long as we wanted. Red pandas very entertaining. Night safari unexpectedly wonderful, so quiet and peaceful, I didn't want it to end. But get here early for that. The tourists literally pour in. We were booked in for 715 entry, should have started queuing well before 7."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"My 2 children aged 8 and 11 were insistent we do this attraction and unfortunately this did not meet their expectations. From their point of view, there weren't enough animals and the animals they did see seemed very similar. They thought there were too many deer like animals. Very expensive for what it was."
,,Fun experience,4.0,,"Visited night safari with few office colleagues on a Friday evening. We were early at the park gate. There was a huge crowd at the main entrance, waiting for their turn to enter the park. Luckily we had corporate membership card so we could bypass the entry queue and queue for the tram ride. The tram ride was fun and informative. We could see many animals in their natural habitat. The animal show was just ok, nothing spectacular"
,,Much too expensive for what you get,2.0,,"This attraction is far too expensive for what the experience offers. My family went tonight and including transportation costs to and from the night safari we spent over 200 USD. Our time slot was 7:15. We waited in a long, cramped, hot line for almost an hour and did not get on a team until 8:15. We had a much better experience at the Chiang Mai Night Safari for far less expense."
,,My,3.0,,Did the night safari. Was not very impressed with the whole experience. Couldn't see the animals as some of them were out of view or in the dark. Weather being hot too makes the experience uncomfortable.
,,July 2016,3.0,,"Booked a tour and meal. Meal was buffet style with great choices.
Safari was in open carriages that were comfortable enough for the occasion.
Unfortunately it seems the tours have become so routine due to the numbers of people going, including us, it has lost the award winning effect. Recommend doing the Night Safari by walking on the trials yourself.
."
,,Nice place to spend the night,4.0,,"The place is about 40 min far from downtown. Traveling through the zoo by train at the dark. All the animals were free, it would be easy to see the animals, but its pretty dark. All quality of pics will be poor, so don't waste the time for taken pictures, just enjoy! In the end you can attend small show for free."
,,What a way to see a Zoo.,5.0,,Must do when visiting Singapore. Book early or on line if you don't want to be out too late. We caught a taxi there and back from downtown Singapore. The taxi queue was a bit disorganised on the way back. The zoo however is brilliant. The food there was ok before you go in. Once you've done the tour by train then do the walk. That way you can take a bit longer to observe the animals you like and you don't have to put up with loud people on the train.
,,What a lovely way to see the zoo,5.0,,"We were here in July and it was crazy hot, so our host decided the best way to see the zoo was at night, and he was right! We got to see many animals that we would not have during the day. The fire eaters were awesome and the shows and presentations were top notch. You will not be disappointed if you decide to do this. I would suggest taking the tram tour, you can walk but the poor folks I saw walking were exhausted and super hot. The tram is the way to go..."
,,Night Adventure,3.0,,Used a tour company and time constraints meant we missed walking around trails. Watched the night creatures show that was good but left us waiting and expecting more. We should have used the time to walk the trails.
,,Not up to standard,3.0,,Too commercialised.animals appears to be posing for the crowds....Not able to see much.non of the animal sounds as you would expect in the wild.....expensive food
,,"long queues, short safari",2.0,,"perhaps the late start is an issue, but you have to book a start time, 7;30, 8;30 etc. Then the stampede starts to the entry. You end up waiting 45 minutes to get on the safari train.
its a great concept, but you barely stop to look at the attraction [the animal] & the train moves again. talk about speed safari! Perhaps the walks would be great, but by the end of it our kids were exhausted & we left."
,,unique attraction for kids,4.0,,"you get the opportunity to see tigers, elephant, lions, rhino at night. this unique opportunity gives you the perspective to understand how the animals behave at night. the feeding times are interesting. good time pass for children. taxi pck up might take time. try to take a tour ride, which would save hassle and time [less cue]."
,,If your holiday short I Don't recommend it,3.0,,We went on a normal day is not a holiday was awesome crowd but not worthy because you'll see animals in the dark and difficult photography to the Flash all I Don't recommend it
,,Fun,5.0,,"Fun tour...go with an organized guide because the lines are outrageous. Warning...lousy for pics. Also, easy to fall asleep...it's dark, it's a moving vehicle...you get it."
,,Night time excursion,4.0,,My wife purchased tickets from Expedia and we had a slight problem trying to redeem because we did not have the physical ticket printed. If you purchase from Expedia remember to print voucher before getting to the location. The staff was helpful with getting this problem solved. The visit was nice and the animals were out. It was surprising to see how close some of the animals were once we got close to their locations. We were on the tram but you can walk the area. Also if on the tram they do allow for you to get off and walk and then get back on at one location. The kids enjoyed the night ride and the animals. We are on site and although it was pricey because of captured crowd the Indian food we had was good.
,,Its a different experience,3.0,,"We visited zoo in the day time so were already quite tired by evening, still we decided to go for night safari as its right next to the zoo. Most of the animal are same which we already saw in the day time. So i guess one can choose either of the two i.e. night safari or visiting zoo in day time."
,,Fun!,5.0,,"This is a great evening out for anyone, but expect crowds and long lines for the trams. As we waited to enter the Night Safari grounds, we were entertained by two fire eaters. We chose to go to the first Creatures of the Night show, then caught the tram. The lines did move quickly though and we soon were on our ride through the night zoo. We were lucky to hear and see an Asian wolf at full howl, tapirs and deer close enough to to touch (we didn't!), elephants munching and tigers relaxing. We got off at the only stop and walked the Leopard Trail. We weren't lucky enough to see the flying squirrel fly. The one we did see was sitting in a tree, but in the bat house we saw the giant fruit bats munching fruit and flying. I ducked!

You can also choose to skip the tram and walk the zoos many trails. The lighting simulates moonlight, so it is dark but not pitch black. The trails are blacktop and smooth walking. There are zoo employees with flashlights at the tram crossings to answer questions and direct you to where you might be wish to go."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Absolutely packed and long queues but well worth the wait. A serene journey by safari bus into the darkness to see wildlife doing what they do at close up range.
,,Plenty of activities!,5.0,,Highly recommended if you hate the sunny zoo. You get to experience the night in the safari. You have to come here to experience it yourself! Adventure is awaiting!
,,a chreographed zoo,5.0,,"perfectly choreographed zoo.even the lion gives you angles for photo opportunity,the elephant will dance(almost) for you.how do they manage to do this?"
,,Overrated. Not recommended.,3.0,,"I visited Singapore zoo in the day. Night safari is just an experience of watching animals in the night that you may not get it anywhere else. However in my honest experience, it's waste of time and money. You hardly see any animal. Better to go for singapore zoo in the day time. You will see a lot many animals and shows.

Overall, I don't recommend it. Somehow agents are selling this as being in night, it fit well in itinary specially for those who are just visiting singapore for 3 to 4 days."
,,A must do!,5.0,,"We booked the river and night safari and had a great evening.

The river safari we started about 5 pm and finished by 6-6.30. So we went to the night safari next door and had some food before our 7.15 booking.

The queues were getting quite big and the wait in the heat would be uncomfortable, and quite a few people chose to try and push their way forward.

But once the ride started it was excellent. It seemed that the animals were on stage for us, and they were really close.

After the tram ride finished we decided to walk the wallaby trail to experience the safari on foot.

It was quite tiring but excellent to do. It took about 2.5 hours total.

One of the best zoo experienced we've had.

It's a must do visit!"
,,Fantastic !!!,5.0,,"This is my 5th time in Night Safari Tour, but 1st time I enjoyed too much with my children b/c i got package fromTripadviser. Great Tour by Tripadvisor n Viator"
,,Wildlife at it's best,5.0,,Night Safari is a must see attraction for traveller exploring Singapore for the first time. A cab from city centre would take approximately SGD 25 one way to reach this place. Safari will take almost 1 Hour through tram. There are intermediate stops in between where you can walk and explore this night habitat as per your convenience. The do have wildlife shows at certain time slots.
,,Great family experience,5.0,,"We visited on a Sunday evening hoping it would be a little quieter but it was heaving! We would suggest doing one of the walks if the queue for the tram is very long, and hop on the tram later when the first crowds have gone. The creatures of the night show is worth seeing"
,,Need some night vision goggles,3.0,,"Now this is extraordinary it was the first in the world and the novelty of it is great. However, it is at night and some animals are difficult to see or are timid obviously, although a tapir walked right past us!! They are animals though, it's always going to be random of how it is.

It's difficult to say what I made of it. You can see there nocturnal animals and they are great but pics are near impossible unless using a top of the line slr so sitting back and enjoying the ride is good. They take you around on these coach/buggie things and you can get off to walk bits if you want.

There is also a show where the trainers demonstrate some of the animals traits and skills in an informative way. This was very very good.

My advice;
It opens at 7:30 if I remember and is near the river safari it's well sign posted. Turn up early, we turned up at 7 and the queue was the length of the courtyard which is huge. The staff are great at getting a lot of people through but be prepared to wait a while if you're not willing to stand in line for so long.

Also the food is mega expensive at the zoo. Bring your own and drinks if you can.

On finishing the night safari we needed a taxi back. From doing this twice it is important if you don't want to queue for ages then sit at the back of the show so you're first out and then walk quick to the rank near the entrance. There will be a lot but there are also loads of people coming out at the same time too.

If you're going by bus the same applies, enjoy the show but quick to the exit."
,,Best Zoo I've Ever Been To,5.0,,"I would recommend doing both the night safari and the zoo if you get a chance. They are different and we only did the night safari, but had a great experience. We LOVED the open ""cage"" policy. The animals had more freedom and all seemed to be in their natural habitat.

The food was delicious (we ate dinner there), the tram was a good experience: a voice talked about different animals as we passed them. We wished the tram had gone a bit slower to allow more time to look at the animals that were active, but my husband and I were able to walk some of the paths after the tram ride.

My parents and brother went to the fire show and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We love animals and most zoos are a bit depressing, but this one seems to really cater to what is best for the animals."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"One of the good place to see , Where animals living on their own style. Battery operated car is available to go around .."
,,A very nice and recommandable Safari,5.0,,"The Night Safari is a famous part of the Zoo of Singapore. You can see a lot of interesting animals like Elephant, Rhino, Hyena, Tiger, Kangaroo, Zebra and so on. You drive with a tram (little train) through the part of the zoo and the can see the animals because there are artificial ""moonlight"" at the preserves. You can stay until 2am (booked tours are ended at 10pm because the buses/coaches drive back to the hotels."
,,Crowded but fun,4.0,,This was an interesting experience. It was great to see the nocturnal animals in their natural settings. When we arrived the crowd was very large and loud but once in the individual cars it was fine. The animal show was also good. Great for children.
,,Well presented,4.0,,It's always enjoyable to go to a zoo but even better at night time. As you expect it was difficult to see all the animals but having two tours by couch and by foot allows you to enjoy the zoo at your own pace.
,,Great attraction,4.0,,"It's worth a visit, and there are some great enclosures. We found the show a bit disappointing but the enclosures is very cool. We went on one of the late shows 10pm, definitely recommend going earlier to giver you time to walk around and explore the park more as last ride out was 11pm."
,,WOW,5.0,,"I honestly expected nothing going to the Night Safari. We booked a tour and thank god we did!! It was crazy busy and the tour got us in some great express lines.
Well worth the money of the tour, especially if you are not overly fond of negotiating big crowds.
I have 2 teenage daughters who just loved how close you are to the animals!"
,,A must see,5.0,,"The Night Safari is definitely a world class attraction. Even before you enter, they have a fun 'live' show - don't miss this - it's called Creatures of the Night & I think the timings are 7.30pm, 8.30pm & 9.30pm, but you will need to check this. You can either walk the various pathways, or catch a tram. I recommend both, as you will get to experience different aspects of the Night Safari. The tram drives right past animals grazing on or very near the route, which you will not see when you are walking. The 'bat cave' is also incredible, but you will need to walk through this. I've been to the Night Safari many times & honestly, I never tire of it. It's such a wonderfully laid out & well run attraction & whenever we have guests in town, we always take them here & they love it."
,,A must do.,5.0,,Night Safari is something everyone visiting Singapore should do. The animals are so much more fun to watch in the muted night lighting and a nice balmy Singapore evening is perfect for a tour.
,,UMMM?,3.0,,"Food was fabulous but not worth while doing it at night. Too dark to see much & just an activity for those not in the ""know""."
,,Amazing time,5.0,,"Got close and personal with nature, plenty of different animals to see and not a cage in sight! Great experience!"
,,You have never been anywhere like it!,4.0,,"Amazing experience, we booked the 7:30 time slot online and found no queues as it was the opening time (great as when we came out the line was huge). We passed on the tram as we wanted to take our time and see everything. The trails are brilliant as you are walking in rainforest with animals on both sides, the darkness makes it a lot better and it isn't too hot. Would highly recommend walking all the trails instead of waiting for the tram me going earlier means there is no queue to enter and no queue for the taxis!!"
,,its just OK,3.0,,"I am an animal lover, so a night safari is right up my ally. However, while the animals are wonderful, I was a bit disappointed with this activity. It goes pretty fast and with so many people you feel like cattle yourself. Its not horrible, so if you have the time check it out---but I would not cancel plans for it."
,,Lots of fun,4.0,,"We did an organized tour which meant we did not have to queue for entry, show or tram ride, so well worth paying the extra. The walks are even better than the tram."
,,Nice nighttime activity,4.0,,"Visited here with friends, we took the 9.30pm show and following train ride around the park. The show was entertaining and the train ride around the park was good too. Good options to get off at various stops along the way and have a better look around. The staff all seem really friendly and like they are enjoying working there which is nice to see! Food options are what you would expect for a tourist attraction. Not terrible but not amazing either. Grab dinner before you go."
,,Worth seeing,5.0,,The night safari was a nice way to see the animals and is well narrated. Not close to downtown but taxi's are cheap in Singapore.
,,GOOD ATTRACTION MINUS THE CROWDS,3.0,,"A great attraction to showcase some nocturnal animals. I have been to this attraction many times in the past and have always enjoyed the commentaries on the trams and also the host of the show. My last visit a week ago however has made me feel that i never want to go back again.
I know that this attraction has become very popular with tourist in SIngapore and the crowds are not a bad reflection of the attraction, however the manner in which people are treated at the Night Safari has left a bad taste with me.
One has to wait over 3 hours to get on to a tram. Children are heard crying and hungry. I feel for the tourist as this attraction has raised its prices at the FnB outlets. How does one justify a plate of plain noodles or local chicken rice for over $19 !! Its a total rip off and tourist are forced to pay as they have no other choice. Its not like the food is of Michelin star grade.

To add to this , the lovely ""LIVE"" commentary on the trams has been replaced with a recorded commentary. As you approach a certain section, it tells you to look left or right in order to spot an animal. The tram is moving and it is dark and often the animals are not in full view and the driver just moves on leaving curious onlookers ""in the dark"". Why this live commentary has been taken off the trams has probably due to cost cutting measure in trying to train staff.

Staff seemed to be interested in talking to each other more than interacting with people. The only time u get attention from a staff member is when they annoyingly try and take pictures of you and sell you the same afterwards. Most tourist and people visiting these attractions usually have their own cameras and annoying selfie sticks with flash taking their own pictures. Why have your staff ""crying"" out annoyingly to sell a photograph.

Management should also record the commentary of the host at the shows and play it back to them to see if the host follow and understand what they are saying. Half the show is about educating people to turn off their flash feature on their cameras.

Its sad that this once amazing animal sanctuary attraction is now nothing more than a money spinning business."
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,"A must see in Singapore. Hearing the nightly sound of the jungle while walking through the forest is very exciting. The tram ride is very entertaining and a highlight of the visit. Also the two shows are great.

Only downside: we had to queue 20 minutes for tickets, 20 minutes to enter the zoo and 40 minutes for the taxi after the visit."
,,Kids would love it. Good experience.,5.0,,"Night safari tries to give you an experience of real jungle safari, with guaranteed sighting of animals and of wide variety. Kids wud love it. Very well organised. Must do."
,,The only night zoo in the world,5.0,,THis place is the ONLY ONE night zoo offered in the world. Excellent experiences where we were able to see animals being VERY ACTIVE at NIGHT vs. other ordinary zoos where we often visited during day times. Worth the money and time to try at least once in your life-time!
,,WOW,4.0,,Night safari in tram was very comfortable as everyone can easily the animals and then there was some fire show that was the best.
,,Spectacular Fire Eater Show,2.0,,Very glad we bought these tickets as part of a tour. Pick up and drop off from hotel was great as it is about 30 minute bus trip from the centre of town. Thousands of people there with long queues if you are not on a pre-booked tour. The tram tour was good but with little opportunity for photos. Also understandably photos can also be only taken without the flash. The fire eater show was spectacular but difficult to see easily with so many people watching and with their hands up taking videos. Seating around this area was very limited.
,,Been there and that's it,3.0,,"Queued for a awhile before we managed to get in and rushed to watch the ""Creature of the night"" show. It was good except that everything seems to be in a rush and ended abruptly (not sure about the rest of the audience but that's our thought). Took the tram and it was too dark to see the animals and the tram just keeps moving. You does not even have sufficient time to spot where the animal is. There were too many deer, i mean different type of deer. It seems more like a deer tram tour than animal. However, i like how close we are to some of the animal."
,,Night safari,4.0,,This was out favourite of all the animal places we visited out of the 4. The tram on this tour unlike the zoo actually takes you past the animals. We took the zoos advice and went for a walk first. Then went to the show and then on the tram. We arrived at 6.45 and left about 10.30 so it's a full evening. Get a table for your evening meal at the back of the bongo burger place then you can watch the fire show whilst eating it. Show starts at 7.15 outside of the park. Hint make sure you wear mossie repellant and take plenty of drinks in with you as no where to buy inside the park you have to exit and re enter.
,,"wild animals real close,but safe",5.0,,"great experience, african lions, asiatic lions, hyenas, rhino, wolves,etc all wild animals u get to see that too uncaged. they take u around in a tram. only tiger is kept behind a glass shield. request ppl to keep silence to enjoy the most, especially kids make noise. parents should teach their kids to maintain silence"
,,Wasting my time just by queuing.,1.0,,"We reached the night safari at 7pm, bought the entrance tickets for 815pm and thought that we can have our dinner there before we go in. By the time we are about to finish the que to the entrance start to build up to a horrible crowd and soon it's chaos.

845pm we are finally in. To my horror, another que to the trams. It took us about 1hrs plus just to be boarded and there are no staffs to direct people with young kids or old folks to a special que. By the time we finish our ride, it's 10pm and we have to be in the bus station at 1015pm.

I really felt cheated with the price I'm paying for the tickets and just spended my time queuing. And I've read so many good reviews and I've thought that nothing could go wrong with Singapore Night Safari!

I'm sorry to say Its disappointing and over rated. Totally a let down on crowd control."
,,Ok but not again,3.0,,"We did this for a 2nd time - 1st time with kids (3 and 6).

The kids enjoyed the tram ride around but overall it wasn't particularly exciting or spectacular. The animals are hard to see and cannot take pictures at night (unless your good that way).

Entertainment afterwards was good but food and drinks very expensive.

Overall worth doing for first timers to Singapore."
,,Worth doing once but porbably wouldn't do again,4.0,,"We bought a tour ahead of the trip so had a pick up from the hotel and a return drop off which was good. The place is very busy, so queues of up- to 1.5 hours are normal for the trams that take you round the park. However, as we were on an organised tour, we were able to skip the queues. The tram tour was good and we saw quite a lot, but it was all a bit contrived and over-hyped. The tram rarely stops so photos are not easy. What we found more fun, was the walking tours, see the animals you want to see at your own pace. If you really want a great experience and haven't been to Singapore before, go to Singapore Zoo (a completely separate park) during the day."
,,Nothing Spectacular,3.0,,"So this was my 2nd vist to the night safari , the last one was with office colleagues and this was with family. The tram ride is okay and nothing great , you wont miss much if you just see the zoo in the day. Might be a better idea to take the trails rather than the tram , that way you can explore more"
,,Pay the extra and ask for Paul or Walter,5.0,,"The night zoo is absolutely worth it IF you book a private tour. It is worth every penny. We had the joy of Walter AND Paul ( in training) guiding us. Walter was fantastic, following keepers who were feeding animals, hanging back to observe and answering any random question the 9 year old had. It made for an enlightening and easy experience. Especially as we whizzed past the crowds, were shown to front row seats for the show and generally treated like royalty for the night in our own private buggy. Magic moments, especially the 10 minutes staring down the tiger while Walter explained their perils and likely extinction. The 9 year old was transfixed, purchased a tiger from the shop and immediately named him Walter. Enough said!"
,,"A night zoo, awesome experience",5.0,,"Counter-intuitively, the animals are more visible at night as they are more active and aren't seeking shelter from the sun. The Night Safari is an excellent visitor experience, and once you are on the tram, you can sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, literally. Very informative (my 17 y.o. daughter commented that she wished she had recorded the audio as she learned so much from it), and if you are tired after a long day sites eyeing, you won't feel like you have missed out on anything if you don't go for a wander around the park exploring on your own after the tram ride.

In hindsight we should have just paid to take a taxi back to the hotel at the end of the night as the public transport, while efficient and clean, was very busy, and over-stretched our stamina."
,,Night Safari- little Hyped tour,2.0,,"we had stand in Queue for about an hour or more to get in Tram. Night Safari appeared more like zoo Safari, where tram stopped in front if some fence or cage for us to see animals. Most of the time you can only see shadow of animals. Its kind of different experience but there are other attraction in singapore worth spending time and money."
,,Fun night,4.0,,"Enjoyed our night here, but wish we'd known a few things. Firstly, the two shows aren't worth the hassle of queuing and waiting for. The tram ride was worth it though, and the long queue actually moved fairly quickly. The walking trails were also good, but definitely take a map with you to plan your walks (and because some double back and the signs were ambiguous a couple of times). Toilets and water also a little sparse so plan accordingly. Finally, we ended up leaving around midnight and public transport options were nil but discovered there's a $10 shuttle to hotels in the city. All said, it was worth the trip out there."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Thrilling experience to engage with animals from a bus at night! Incredibly fun and an amazing and memorable event worth visiting!
,,So Memorable!,5.0,,"This was a really super thing to do with kids. The only downside was that bathrooms are not very nearby to the line-up area for the vehicles which they transport you in, so make sure your children have 'been' before you line up...!
The fire show before the night safari transport begins was very exciting."
,,Better than expected,4.0,,"Went with 3 young kids out of curiosity. Didn't have much expectations as I didn't think it would be as good as the other two attractions... it mean what can one expect to see when it's dark? I was in for a surprise.

At the entrance, one is greeted with a fire eating performance. The tram ride was great! It was amazing that when my kid also touch one of the tapir during the ride as there are no barriers at some areas in the journey so the animals, those daring enough would walk right up.

The only disadvantage was the hot weather. But a great place to come back to especially with kids."
,,experience a jungle....,5.0,,"we had heard from so many people about the night safari, but once you experience it, it is better than what we had heard. the experience starts with a fire performance and once you get inside, you can choose from a tram ride or a self walk in tour. we chose to do both-partly. the animals are in open enclosures, with some barriers, like pits, water bodies, but offer unobstructed views. The live show is an amazing experience especially for the kids. we walked to all possible areas (permitted zones), and enjoyed once in a life time experience"
,,Animals at night,4.0,,"At the entrance there is a show with flames (good one) and inside there is an animal show (not a must). The tram ride is good. We went on a friday night in July, arrived at 20.00 but could not enter before 21.15, because of the long que. They just let people in at 19.15, 20.15, 21.15 and 22.15. Be sure to meet early so you have time for a guided walking tour in the park."
,,The best,5.0,,"Undoubtedly the best zoo in Asia, excellent maintenance and care has been given to the animals, left in a very natural setting and children can interact with them. Themed shows make the overall experience interesting and worthwhile for every $spent. Night safe is a must watch."
,,Not bad,4.0,,"For about $30, you get to go on a tram ride of the entire night safari (got to queue) and there are walking trails for u with guides at certain areas, just to make sure u are not lost. The trails would leave u at your own pace so that you can explore the area and read and understand on the specific types of animals"
,,Wonderful night experience,5.0,,"The only time we get to see animals that prowl around at night. Catch the animal show before you enter the enclosures to get up close and personal with the animals.
The tram is recommended so you can see all the animals while seated comfortably. The lightings are set for you to view the animals without disturbing them.
Do take a walk into the bats enclosure, can be scary but it's one of the lifetime experience!
It's definitely a must visit when you are in Singapore!"
,,So bad experience!,1.0,,"Me and my sister were able to see the Nigh Safari after a great Singapore Zoo experience on 18 July 2015 . First, we had a dinner at the buffet restaurant (forgot the name of the restaurant). We choose to sit at a quite comfortable table for four before a staff came. What I did not like was the staff wanted us to move to other table so that a group of Japanese will take our table (who came about 10 minutes later). Actually, I did not get the logic of transferring us to a table that we didn't choose in the first place. The second thing that I was bit offended when the same restaurant staff approached us again and repeatedly telling us the buffet price which is very awkward in our part as customers. We are not rich people and we don't look like rich people, but before we decided to go to that restaurant we assured that we had enough money to spend. Then, after that lousy dinner we headed to an animal show. I found that the host is very clever, she can speak different languages (very impressive) and the show was quite entertaining. Last, was falling asleep during the tram ride because was really so tired standing in that horrible long crowded compact queue. I did see unrecognizable animals far from my sight but it was a whole crap! Sorry, really it was really bad experience and very un-entertained."
,,Gone downhill sadly,2.0,,"Been more than 5 or 6 times. Was brilliant to start but over the years the queues to get in and then take the train have got out of hand ... The train ride through the zoo is rather short, and although you see animals there are too many people not respecting the no noise and no flash photography rules ... The food and drinks are very average and then taxis hard to come by with massive queues of people trying to all leave at the same time. So disappointing as this is not the norm usually with Singapore tourist attractions ..."
,,The only good thing is you see the animals up REAL close,3.0,,"The safari is open for only a few hours as staff and visitors need to sleep obviously, so it closes at midnight. However it also becomes too dark to see anything properly, making the things you can do here really limited. And you cant come too early like 7-6pm cos the animals might not have waken up yet.

Because of the darkness, its really hard to wander on your own in the park - they're really thoughtful to create the animals' real natural environment so streetlights were a bare minimum. The dense vegetation also makes it hard to figure your way around :( I strongly recommend taking the tram which goes one round around the entire park. That ride is pretty much the highlight of the entire visit, but guessing it was a 40min ride it wasn't too bad. There are trails u could walk, but I think the tram would cover more ground, and u need time to walk the trail, each is abt 20-30min, so plan your time here.

As the name suggests there were NO enclosures at all, animals literally walked across the tram path freely and as the path was quite narrow, you could get quite close with the animals if they grazed near the sides. Larger and more dangerous animals are probably separated by a ditch or something i think. The closeness u get w so many animals is something I never had before so this was pretty memorable for me.

Apart from the ride there was a Creatures of the Night animal shows at 1hour intervals. They were meh, can check it out if u have time.

Overall, worth coming once only."
,,One of the highlights of our trip to Singapore,4.0,,We did a tour through Buffalo Tours and glad we did as we got priority seating on the trams instead of having to line up with the public. Fantastic experience sitting in the tram with animals walking beside the road. We had a buffet dinner at one of the eateries and it was lovely food. We went walking along the trails after the tram ride instead of going to one of the live animal shows and that was really good to get up close with the animals.
,,A very late night - be ready to queue,4.0,,I had read the previous reviews about the lines so i booked a tour so we couuld avoid the llines to get on the tram ride. Apparently they were 1.5 hours long!! The tramride was good - however this place is let down by the waits. Get more trams !!!!! By the time we got home it was after 11 and our kids were exhausted. And eat before you go - the food is ordinary.
,,Worst places i have ever visited .,1.0,,Being recommended by lot of friends we went there but it was a total waste of time . comparing with chimelong zoo in guangzhou and safari world in Bangkok night safari stand nowhere . we entered night safari at 8pm when it usually starts . but we were shocked they have a total of 3 shows and out of those 2 of them runs together . the shows were really pathetic . 90% Animals in the zoo are indian animal and i was shocked to see 90% indian were there to see them. i have no clue why my friends and forced us to visit this place. AVOID THIS PLACE
,,Strange journey,3.0,,It was a tram ride around some lit up spots. Very dark elsewhere except every 30yds or so there was alit up area where different animals were near food. It felt very organised and very much like little areas for each group of animals. We saw things that we hadnt seen before but we didnt like the false situation the animals were in.
,,mesmerizing and real feel of jungle,5.0,,"We did a walking trail called wallaby trail first as tram ride had a huge queue. The entry is timed and we were in at 8.15 slot, that was a good time as lot of animals were feeding at that time and we didn't miss any! we saw the creatures of the show and then went for the ram ride. The tram ride is awesome with right pace and with audio describing about animals as we move along"
,,A good day/night out,4.0,,"We started the day wrong by relying on public transport to get to the zoo, and wasted nearly two hours from our hotel to front gate. Much simpler to take an air conditioned taxi and arrive stress free, as you will enjoy the animals all the more, as you are greeted by a frisky bunch of cotton-top Tamarins, who are not shy about being photographed as they play above your head. With so much to see, we allowed all day, and brought the double (and discounted )tickets for the day and the night zoo visit. Throw in the bird park as well, and you get that cheaper as well. However we chose to take the $5 tram ride option to cut down on walking, and this is a great way to get around like a hop on, hop off system to see your favourite animals. Allow for some standing around time, as the queue on the day we were there, (the start of the school holidays!!) the tram rides were at a premium and very popular with family groups There is a great kids zone splash park near stop 2, for refreshments/snacks, but take a change of clothes for the kids/adults who are going to get wet for sure.Or you can slip out the main door, get your hand stamped, and slide into KFC for something to sustain you, then come back in again.
The night zoo was a must for us, but we seriously underestimated the crowd, so start to queue early as the gates open at 7pm. You can watch the fire eaters show for free, it is very entertaining for all ages as you wait to get in to catch your tram that will take you through the night jungle, as for once, the eyes are on you!"
,,"Hot, Humid but Totally Worth it!",4.0,,"Brought my family to Night Safari when my 3 kids were toddlers. Recently we all went again, this time with 3 teenagers in tow. The fun is still there. The sense of adventure still the same as the tram plunges into the darkness of the jungle.

It was wonderful to be so close to God's magnificent creatures. To see, to smell and to hear their squeaks, snorts and roar... awesome.

The safari folks did a wonderful job creating a sense of wildness and danger being so up close with the animals. When I saw the leopard turned and walked towards me... I was transfixed. Its eyes were so intense and it was so close, I couldn't move. I would have been eaten if not for the glass separating us... maybe not, but it certainly felt so at that time. That feeling was more exhilarating than the toughest ride in a theme park.

The best way to experience the park is to first take the tram and then walk around the park using its various trails. We made it to the mangrove cave where the free-flying bats soared. The brave ones in the family ventured in and were greeted by bats zooming around them. They conquered their fears... I am content to stand and watch.

Be prepared to give at least 3 hours for a good time in the park. Ours turned out to be a good workout. It was hot and humid but certainly worth it."
,,A must do in Singapore!,5.0,,This is a must-do while in Singapore and if you buy the zoo multi pass which includes the Singapore Zoo & River Safari - it's value for money. So interesting to see the nocturnal animals out and about - the tram is included in the price so if you're wanting to take a load off after a full day at the zoo - this is perfect! You can also get off at various stops if you wanted to explore the night zoo in more detail!
,,Unique zoo,4.0,,"Amazed by the animal show! Very clean and organized. Easy to navigate about However, very expensive! Would visit again"
,,Pangolin exhibit. Excellent Conservation efforts,4.0,,"Great to be able to see animals behaving naturally and more active than I had seen them in the zoo. Visitors are encouraged to keep quiet and not use flash to allow animals to remain undisturbed. Tram ride takes around minutes with a guide talking through the animals on display. A huge highlight for me was the Pangolin exhibit. I came to south East Asia to see Pangolins because I am fully aware of their highly endangered nature due to their illegal trade and was not disspointed by the conservation efforts and exhibit here.

Lots of animals you cant usually see active on show here (Binturongs for example) and a great way to fully experience Asias Wildlife"
,,Take a walk,5.0,,The night safari has an option of train and also one can walk. I preferred to walk and in the last part took a train. The sound of insects and the darkness gives a feel of real jungle.
,,Don't go Saturday night!,1.0,,"We got there at 6:45pm and couldn't get in till 9:15pm. We started queuing at 8:20 for the 9:15 show. The queues for everything were too long. The seats on the left hand side of the stage we had for the Creatures of the Night show had no view of two animals. There was a 50 minute wait for the tram. The last Hop on Hop off bus left at 10:30 so when we got out at 11:20 we had to queue for a taxi. It was chaotic! With so many people the Zoo staff suggested people call to book Taxis. This meant that most taxis that came were booked and the queue did not work at all , we waited 50 minutes. So many people had young children. The Taxi driver said this was unusual but zoo staff said most Saturday nights were busy. We had left the bus station on the first bus at 6pm and got back to our hotel at 12:30am!! It was not a good experience!"
,,WOW WOW WOW,5.0,,"you must go!
At the airport we were approached by a salesman and we decided to the buy the tickets for a night safari. He reassured us that we were getting a great deal!
I love animals however I was slightly scared of the possibilities of a lion attacking me or a monkey etc. The man again said there is NOthing to worry about. We took his word for it. The tickets we bought included a mini bus that would take us and others that have got the same deal. The actual night safari, a show which includes different animals AND a little event at the end of the night.
I cant remember the exact price but what I do no is that you NEED to buy tickets at the airport.
We were given our tickets from the airport and told exactly where we had to meet the next day. We were there on time and out driver was ready for you. He couldn't speak English which was a little difficult but it was still a very good ride to the zoo. Three other girls were on the van with us. We all got to no each other well. As we arrived it was EXTREMELY busy. If you are taking kids make sure to hold their hand throughout. We had to go through a couple of queues but it was WELL WORTH IT. We finally got on (all 5 of us) and the journey began .. We saw lions and tigers... All sorts of animals with the instructor informing everyone not to take pictures with flash. I was really scared but it was good scared. The instructor told us about the all animals we pointed out.
After the night safari was over we then went around the zoo and check out snakes and other animals .. We even feed animals.
After this we went to a show .. U get informed what time the show is at. The show was amazing! It is soooo worth it. Really good for kids. Audience get bought to the front and one man had a big snake around him it was really funny.
We were told an animal had escape but it was all part of the fun.
After the show was this dance show on for everyone. It was a couple of man dancing with fire.

Overall AMAZING! Need to see it. I would go again!"
,,Night Safari is a magical experience,5.0,,Take the zoo tram and also walk the night safari route The creatures of the night show is entertaining
,,Awesome tram rides!,4.0,,"They have entry by timing, so it's best to buy your tickets beforehand. They have a free tram ride that takes you to places only accessible by tram and a walking trail.

My friend and I did the walking trail first before going on the tram as everyone else rushed for the tram first so it was a long queue. The walking trail is great, as you get to see them up close but you really have to look for the animals as they can be hard to see. The tram will bring you to the other animals up close and real close! Don't worry though, they won't attack. It was about a 40 minutes wait for the tram but if you go on a weekday, I'm sure it won't be as long. But the tram was definitely worth it though."
,,Most dis- organized and chaotic place,1.0,,"Pretty disappointed with the poorly organised arrangements to let the guests enter the place. Long and dis-organized queues, little or no guidance from the staff, no regard for the elderly who are also made to wait and be pushed around in the crowd that builds ip to enter every hour.
While the exhibits were ok, but not worth the hassles."
,,Great evening,5.0,,Well organised and great to see the animals in their natural environment. Not pricey either! Will definitely go back and recommend to others.
,,Not worth it and poorly organised!,1.0,,"The night safari sounded wonderful to my friend and I. It was one of the most highly rated things to do so we bought tickets online beforehand with promise of efficient entry to a limited number of seats at 8:15pm. However, from 7 o'clock the space leading up to the queue entry point was ham filled with people. There is just a big mass of people, no separation of the queues leading up to entry and that alone took 45minutes. Add to that people pushing in, little kids touching you while your body sweats away under your limited clothing, and shrieking and crying families. So you wind your way for at least an hour through a snaking queue once someone had taken your ticket to the smell of citronella and at least you have fans blowing on you intermittently. I have to tell you, the reviews said this would be a good date night bit if someone took me to this one. Date I may push them off the tram into the lions! So far, and I haven't even gotten into a tram - it is not worth the money!!!!"
,,Fun with friends,4.0,,Short ride around the zoo at night in an open air tram type cat. Had a great time due to the company I had though there wasn't a ton to see. I don't expect the animals to entertain us especially when most were sleeping so it was nice to see the ones that were up and about. Seems to be a nice zoo where animals are well cared for.
,,Great for the family,4.0,,"We went here after a day at the river safari. When you buy your tickets you have to book in an entrance time, make sure you get there at least 20 minutes (if not more) before that time as the line is huge. While waiting in line they put on a fire breathing show to the left so try and get as far left as possible if you want to see it. When you first get in it is better to go straight to the right and head down the path to do the animal show to get that out of the way first. The show was cancelled for us part way through as it started spitting rain. When we come out (and of course it stopped raining straight away) from that we went to go on the tram tour but as the line was too long we walked around some of the tracks instead. Cameras are useless as you aren't allowed to use a flash and there is very little lighting around the park but seeing the animals was great. We then went back to do the tram tour and the line was even longer but it does move fast! What looked like a line that would take over an hour only took about 20minutes so it is worth the wait. We went on a Saturday night it was probably more busier then a week night would be."
,,Good experience but nothing new !,3.0,,Night safari was a good outing but I visited in the month of July 1st week and it was extremely hot ! We took the tram pass to see the nocturnal animals . The best way to explore this park is to walk and follow different trails. Personally my overall experience was ok and nothing really great . I'd rather prefer to go to a zoo where I can touch and feed the animals like the one in Bangkok where touching the Tigers is a big attraction for the kids !
,,Fantastic Experience- a must do in Singapore!,5.0,,"My husband and I visited the night safari, it is by far one of the best things to do in Singapore. We took the MRT to Ang Mo Kio station, then took the 138 bus which stopped right outside the Night Safari, River Safari and the Singapore Zoo entrances. We went without a ticket which in hindsight was maybe a mistake. There are 3 different admission times 7.15, 8.15 and 9.15. When we arrived the 7.15 admission time was fully booked so had to go for the 8.15 time. This meant we had to wait before we could go into the actual safari. Outside the safari are a couple of fast food areas and shops to browse through. They did also give us a free pass into the river safari as currently a lot of the sites were closed for renovation. It was still pretty good to see the manatees that they have there, but no boat ride unfortunately. As soon as 8.15 came you were let into the park and could either go by tram around the park or walk. As there was a big queue for the tram we decided to walk around. This was brilliant! Obviously it is very dark and spotting the animals is half the fun but walking around felt so much more of a natural experience. The Asian otters were particularly cute, being able to hear them before you could see them. The bat enclosure was also very good although not for the feint hearted. We walked halfway around, then jumped on the tram to experience the elephants, Rhinos and the other larger animals that aren't accessible by walking. We got back to the beginning and jumped on to see the first half again but on the tram. Then at halfway hopped off and walked the final bit which consisted of hyenas, Tigers and flying squirrels.
The tram took approximately 40 mins with the second half of the trip taking most of that chunk. If you wanted to walk only part of the safari, it would definitely have to be the first half. There are four trails, 2 for each half of the safari. It took us half an hour for each trail but could easily be done in 15 minutes. We finished everything at 11 but missed the show! My advice would be to buy a ticket beforehand for the 7.15 admission so you have a longer time going around all the animals."
,,A nice night time zoo,5.0,,A nice night time zoo. A good place to view many animals in their night surroundings. There were many different types of animals in their night surroundings. The kids loved it and had a good time viewing the many different types of animals in the night.
,,Pre-booked tour bypasses queues,4.0,,"We pre-booked with RMG tours, and while pick-up took a while we then missed the long queues for entry and trams!!
Managed to get around the whole zoo in 2hrs, tram ride 40mins and the walked the trails.
Great to see the rhinos, elephants, lions. cheetahs, tiger, giraffe, water buffalo's etc, and at around 8-9pm they were easily seen. Can't help but question the size of enclosures and relativity, but we did want to go and see them ....."
,,Most Interesting Experience,4.0,,"The zoo venues are very family oriented and interesting ways to view the natural world. The night zoo tram is the easiest way to see the sights of the animals in what appear to be spacious and naturalized settings. The quality of the activity is keenly affected by the other visitors on the tram, which you can't control. If someone is attempting to use a flash camera or there are crying children, it is hard to see and hear the guide and/or animals."
,,"The Night Safari, Fun for kids, not worth the hype for adults",2.0,,"I walked away from this experience feeling very uneasy with everything. Unfortunately, like most zoos, you walk around visiting the animals in their sectioned off cage or habitat. This experience was no different except it was night time and most animals were siting in one spot looking forward under what feels like a street lamp or spotlight, perched or propped for your enjoyment. Most of the animals on display aren’t even nocturnal animals, inactive and depressing. Some were moving but the whole experience seemed unnatural.

The Queue to take the trolley was unbearably long, especially in the heat and humidity. The cab ride to the zoo from Chinatown Singapore was 20Singapore dollars and it was 60$ Sinapore dollars to go back to our hotel by Taxi (we had to wait in queue for 20 mins).

All in all, not worth the 60USD for the Night Safari. Save yourself the hassle and go to the normal Singapore Zoo."
,,Interesting Walking Trails and Creatures Show,5.0,,"We visited on a Monday, it was not so crowded and waiting times was bearable. We bought tickets from Safari Gate at Suntec and took the open top bus at 6pm. The journey took about 45mins with slight traffic jam.

The door opened at 7.15pm and we went to the Creatures of The Night Show first. It was a very good show, educational and entertaining.

We then went by foot on all the trails - Wallaby, East Lodge, Leopard and Fishing Cat, and took the tram at the very end. If you do not have the time to do all, the highlights will be East Lodge Trail and Leopard Trail where you can see tigers, lions, zebras, leopards. Don't miss the tram ride too as you can see tapirs and deer roaming freely.

Upon exit, we took bus 138 to Ang Mo Kio MRT (about half an hour ride)."
,,"Great, unique experience",5.0,,"Did both the tram ride and the walking routes, all 4 of them.

For the tram, we queued about 40 minutes, ride lasts c. 30. Walking took about 1.5 hours. Saw elephants, lions, wolves, different types of deers and pigs, otters, bats, and others.

Nice experience overall. Opens at 7pm, closes at midnight."
,,only good part tram ride through jungle at night.. hardly could see any animal,3.0,,"The 45 minutes tram ride through dark dwindling roads of the jungle was the only good part. I could not see much of the animals.
They have a fire show at the entrance plaza before night safari starts. If you are going there must see the show. Free of cost and good.
The safari comes with a good cost and as it ends late night reaching city further is will be very late. So plan accordingly as this zoo and night safari park is located far away from main part of city. (though connection by bus and MRT is good). and it may eat up whole day of your trip, which one may utilize in other better things in Singapore."
,,Wonderful Night Time experience!,5.0,,"The Night Safari in Singapore was the first Night time safari to open, and It provides a wonderful experience and gives you a chance to see animals that are active night time in their true element. The tram gives you a nice tour through the different geographical zones and the tour guide presents the animals to you. Lights that resembles moonlight enables you to watch the animals in as natural night light as possible. The Singapore Night Safari is by far the best zoo experience I ever had worldwide!"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Arrived on a Friday evening at 1900 to find Long queues to buy tickets.
Also the earliest entry we could buy was 2115-not a disaster as we needed to get something to eat and have a look around the gift shops .
We have been to the night safari around 5 times so we decided to try something new regarding food so went for the buffet . It was really good ($45/adult and $34/child).good quality and value.
Anyway due to the ridiculous queue arrangement to get in to the safari, we couldn't see the fire eating show at all!
The queue to get through the turnstiles would push anyone's patience !
Once in we decided to go for the night show rather than queue again for the tram but it was full. So queue more we did for the tram.
We did the tram, got back for the 2230 night show and it was full also! So end result was none of us saw the night show.
We did most of the walks which is a good, different experience -especially if you have family or friends visiting Singapore.

So recommendation ,if you are unable to book entry in advance , don't go up on at the weekend expecting to have a smooth entry and enjoyable entry experience !

The operator needs to do something because it never used to be like this , you bought your ticket and went in .
Whatever the intention of the timed entries -it's not working !

Disappointing as the whole experience used to be excellent"
,,Visit with the family,3.0,,"We visited and did the 40 minute tram ride and the creatures of the night show. I wouldn't go again. Overpriced and not very exciting in my opinion. We didn't have a chance to visit the day zoo, recommend doing that instead of the night safari - not worth it."
,,go late as possible,3.0,,"the fire twirlers at the entrance were good .
the waiting time was unacceptable 45 mins before entry then another 1hr .15 mins for the tram, lots of foreigners thinking they can queue jump, not on my watch buddy!!
once on the tram it was fantastic all the animals were like an arms length away
go to the latest show if possible once every other pushy impatient turd has moved on"
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,Its a unique experience of visiting a zoo at night. I had set my expectations too high so it was a downer for me. The fire show before the safari was excellent. Overall a great experience if you do not set your expectations too high.
,,Good for Children,3.0,,"Night Safari, though looks promising, is a complete let down in terms of animals that we see in the Safari. It seems that the animals are trained not to attack the people going in the safari. The food in the Safari is highly overpriced."
,,Animals close up and personal,4.0,,"Recommended by family who had visited previously, we went to Singapore Zoo for the Night Safari. The trip was pre-booked with Tour East through Trailfinders, as part of our holiday package, which was a shrewd move as they are registered with the Singapore Tourist Board and this allowed us to jump the extensive queues. Our package also included a buffet dinner (Indian/Chinese) in one of the zoo's catering outlets, which was good if not quite as authentic as that available in Little India and Chinatown.

The safari is conducted on 'trams' - electric tugs pulling trailers (a bit Jurassic Park) with a recorded commentary in English. We came as close to the animals as you are ever likely to and I still can't work out why they weren't spooked as we drove through their enclosures. No flash photography means you need a top of the range camera to fully exploit the opportunity. Deer, cattle, buffalo, lion, tiger, elephant, giraffe, zebra, pigs, bear, hippo, tapir and rhino were all easily seen, up close and personal. The problem was that the journey was rushed. I'd have liked to have spent time observing the animals. We probably stopped for no longer than 10 seconds in each enclosure. So the tour concluded in 35 minutes or so. There is also a 'Meet the Animals' show, which we watched on a wide screen outside the amphitheatre, and there are some spectacular fire-eaters to keep the crowd in the queues occupied (we heard 2 hours in the queue can be expected at peak times). There's also the standard range of merchandising at the inflated norm for a Theme Park.

Overall I'd give it 4/5 spoilt by not being able to spend more time observing the animals."
,,Long wait for the tram,3.0,,"It's a long way from the city.
The performance before the gates open is quite entertaining.
The queue for the tram was quite long. We waited for about 2hrs for a 30min ride. They only thing I don't like was seeing people who came after us ride the tram before us on another station. They need to come up with a better system for that.
It is dark so it would be difficult to see some of the animals but this is something the kids would enjoy.
The Creatures of the Night show is also something for the kids and the kids at heart.
And, for those who don't mind long walks, you can always take one of the trails.
Remember:
1. No flash photography.
2. Wear comfortable walking shoes.
3. Bring water."
,,Will not go back again,3.0,,Went there with friends during May. Probably the time we went coincide with school holidays and hence there were lotsss of people...the queue was very long..we felt humans are more than the animals! Felt disappointed for the animal show too. We expected something exciting/ a climax for the show but there wasn't.
,,Go with a tour group: turn off FLASH,4.0,,"We went with a tour group and I'm glad we did. It was very busy and seemed quite chaotic. Our group was sent to the creatures of the night show 1st, this was about half hour show in which we saw 4/5 animals.
They tried to make it humorous by pretending to have an escaped snake, but you could tell this was very forced. And if you were towards the back you could not really see the animals which were shown.
Our group was then priority boarded on to the tram , this upset a few people in the queue system and they then started to make a scene shouting etc at the staff.
The tram takes 40mins approx to go around but sometimes it's to quick to spot the animals. If you want to see all the animals then you would have to go around twice sitting on both the left and right sides of the tram.
If you can avoid the front row of the 2nd carriage as its directly behind the main tram car and you have the exhaust fumes and heat from it directly in your face.
We left the tram and decided to do the walking trail ""fishing cat"". It was alright walking it until you had to go back to the entrance if you are doubling back on the trail the way back is uphill and quite tiring.

It amazed me how many people ignored the no flash or spotlight rule,it is put in place to protect the animals and guests. so before you go make sure you have a good camera which can take night pictures without a flash, otherwise don't bother taking one. I got a couple of usable photographs at the show when the put on their own lights, but none of the animals from the tram or habitats."
,,Tram is a must,5.0,,"The night safari opens at around 7.30 in the eve with a show at 7 PM at the entrance area. Since we visited this place on Saturday, there was a lot of rush . After getting in a Gate-1, one has to wait for the tram. It was a long queue for the tram. You can visit certain areas by yourself but after certain point you will be required to sit in the tram. A must if you want to have the feel of jungle at night,"
,,Diffrent exp for Zoo,4.0,,"Well, if you want to visit jungle in night..do plan a visit to night safari..there are different trails..Animals look lovely in night..Do turn off flash light in camera while clicking..Transportation from any hotel is convenient..I would choose night safari over singapore zoo.."
,,Not as good as expected,3.0,,"The location is quite a way outside the city so allow enough travel time to make your booked timeslot. We had some food there which was very nice and then went into the Creatures of the Night show. We lined up for a good 20mins and when the show finally started...well let's say that's 20mins of your life you won't get back, It was dreadful, no more than 5 animals were involved (and briefly at that), the hosts were good but there was no substance to it and other than pushing the recycle message hard, it was a complete waste of time.
After that we jumped on the train and circumnavigated the park looking at all the different animal exhibits. As you would expect, it's quite hard to see as the lighting is very dim but although my husband and I weren't overly impressed, the kids loved it and actually considered it the highlight of the trip.
For an alternative trip to the zoo it's worth doing but if you don't get the chance, you haven't missed much!"
,,This Place Surprised Me,5.0,,"Before going here, I had been to the Singapore Zoo, River Safari, and Bird Park. I did not go to the Night Safari because it was a little less convenient to go at night and I figured it would be nothing special since I've been to the other 3 unique zoos. Much to my surprise, this is such a good place to visit. In fact, it's probably my favorite of the 4 zoos. It's just such a unique visit in the zoo at nighttime and almost all of the animals were active. You have to sign up for a time to enter. Then they make you watch this show where a guy twirls fire sticks. I thought the show was awful so we got in early. We got on the trolley and it was a pleasant 35 minute ride. The animals are so close and some don't even have barriers if they are animals that pose no threat. After the trolley ride, there is a path to follow to see the animals you can't see on the trolley. That path takes about 1.5-2 hours to walk depending on your pace. You could do it faster too of course. There is just something exciting about seeing the animals active at night. I would highly recommend any local to do the Night Safari. And if I have visitors to Singapore, I'm probably going to have them visit the Night Safari instead of the Zoo. It's just unique and your'e less likely to find something like this anywhere else."
,,"4 parks pass, night Safari a must!",4.0,,"You can get the 4 parks pass this time of the year ( 4 parks for the price of 2), this includes the Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Bird Park. I ended up doing just 2 of those, the river and night safaris. River safari was good but you can skip this if you have been to similar parks elsewhere. The Night Safari however is a must. Its an amazing experience and the tour is very well planned and organised. Great open space for the animals, not caged and you get quite up close with the trams. Absolutely loved it. Its gets really crowded though so plan your time well and discover the trails at your leisure after the tram rides. The night I went, the popular 'Creatures of the Night Show' was cancelled, so was disappointing. Highly recommend the zoo for families. You can easily make a great day out and night at the parks the zoo offers."
,,Could have been longer,4.0,,"The safari journey does not take long on the guide bus which felt insufficient, I would suggest that at the first opportunity that is offered for you to trek with a guide you should take it as it takes a little while sometimes to see the animal in the moonlight safari. We opted for the night safari with dinner and the dinning experience was quite good. Just felt it went quickly"
,,Fun for all ages,5.0,,"Well done, delightful train guide and first night to see the baby elephant! Everyone even our two year old kept going for 2 hours."
,,Kids loved it,4.0,,So if you're here with children then this is a must go to place. For adults it's okay. Our kids simply loved the place especially the show. The food at the restaurants is below par so I wouldn't recommend eating here but then again you're here for the animals and not the food :-)
,,Long wait in line.,2.0,,"We arrived around 1915 and found long queues for tickets & entry. Entry was after 2015 as 1915 entry tickets sold out. Shows were full & tram queue was very long. However staff managed crowd well.
The animals were lovely to see at night, I just wonder how happy they are though
Tram ride was worthwhile.
Walking trails were fun & worthwhile
Food court food was pretty good.
Getting to the zoo is by bus, tour or taxi. Entry is pricey but so is Chester our local zoo.
I would not go again & if I was with young children in view of time spent queuing I would not go here.
If you go do not take tram immediately, walk down a trail for awhile then go back to the tram later.
Are any days quieter? Not sure"
,,Over rated.,3.0,,"Disorganised chaos, that's how I would describe it. Wasn't bad but was far from great. I wouldn't lose any sleep if I missed it."
,,Alternative night out,4.0,,"great night out, the place itself is very clean and the staff are superb. Don’t waste time taking your camera, it’s unlikely you will catch much in the dark as you can’t use your flash for obvious reasons. Walk round the park first before you take the jeep safari and avoid any lengthy wait’s."
,,WASTE OF MONEY,1.0,,"If you want to pass some time on night time from far from main city, it is good.
I cannot understand that why they are highlighting it a lot? Nothing else except you are travelling in a zoo at night time.
If you are going both Bangkok and Singapore then Bangkok`s Jungle Safari is much-much better comparatively this. In Bangkok`s Jungle safari Loins had came to near to our car.
That (Bangkok`s) was the excellent experience. Here it is total waste of money."
,,Expensive outing. So disorganised and people are. Packed like sardines in queues.,3.0,,"Not worth your time effort or energy! So disorganised. Once a show is sold out, you can't even get in for an hour till next one. No seats or benches while you wait either."
,,Loved it!,4.0,,"Dark & mysterious, the animals truly come out at night. Came here with my husband with little expectations. It was amazing! Loved watching the animals in their habitat, even got to pet a baby wallaby! Got a bit scared in the bat enclosure though!

However the mainland tourists were really loud and chatty.. Ruined the vibes in some areas, as it was tranquil and peaceful before hand."
,,Total waste of time,1.0,,This was very bad experience .......there was long waiting in tram and as such nothing new ....looking like normal zoo.Total waste of time.There was no proper crowd management....creature show was cancelled and staffs were not informative....staffs were creating queue for show and tourists including various school kids waited for an hour and suddenly they announced cancellation of show.Only food joints/other stores were time pass for tourists.In my view....one should not include this in sightseeing....instead give this additional time to Sentossa or Universal .O
,,Great for all the family,5.0,,"Great place to visit, I recommend the creatures of the night show. The tram is also good to get around. If I'd have been on my own I would have taken the walking trails as well."
,,family trip - memorial moments- Night safari,5.0,,it was family trip so familiar destinations were included in the trip after universal studio the night safari was liked by the family members on the second number . fully maintained fully safe .
,,The pain of the queue negated a lot of the appeal,2.0,,"I should have read some of these reviews before I went! My wife stayed home with the baby while I took our 3 and 5 year old daughters. Picked the earliest session (7:15) and thought on a Sunday night it couldn't be too busy. How painfully wrong we were. We got out of our taxi at 7:20 (not bad, I thought), and were met with a wall of hundreds (looked like thousands) of people queuing in front of us. Got through that, and were herded directly into the tram queue to began the long, hot, queuing process again. We finally got on a tram at 8:40, and saw our first animal about 5 minutes later. That's nearly an hour and a half after we arrived. I will say that once the tram trip started, I could see why it is so popular. It's a great attraction and very well done. But seriously, why are they letting in that many people for each session if they don't have the facilities to cope? I would definitely recommend the attraction, but you need to go on a quiet night (not sure how you'd pick this in advance), or they need to reevaluate how they manage their crowds."
,,Worst Tourist Attraction in Singapore,1.0,,"Far out from the city centre - not close to any MRT, train station or bus station. It is a 45 min journey from the city centre. As a result of the distance and the way the evening activities are structured, prepare to have a very late night. Despite pre booking, queued for 2 hours to get into the facility and another hour to get onto the trams, which is the only way to see the various geographical regions. There is no proper queuing system, no fans or aircons or water stations during this queuing experience.The tram experience is about 45 minutes long, the various regions which have clusters of animals are very poorly lit, hence trying to see them or to capture photos is near impossible. There are walking trails throughout the facility but, even on these trails, you cannot really get close to the animals to be able to see them in the dark. Even the lion and tiger feeding sessions are difficult to see let alone photograph. The Thumbuakar Show is at the entrance to the facility and is in a very poor location as it is a fire show for about 10 minutes of fire eating and blowing stunts. Difficult to view as it is not elevated and at ground height. The Creatures of the Night Show is about 20-30 minutes long, quickly filled, therefore, will have to stand in another queue for about 40 minutes. The show is nothing special. There are lots of food and beverage facilities which have a wide variety for all.
This is a tourist trap, very expensive for S$45 per person, no cheaper children pricing, waste most of the evening queuing in hot humid conditions to get in, get on the tram and to watch the 1 show. I will never recommend it to anyone. There are lot better tourist attractions in Singapore."
,,Animals look very sad,2.0,,Went to this night safari. It was difficult to get to easily. I took the MRT and then a taxi. I then watched a fire show and took the trolley through the zoo. Folks ignored the direction not to use flash photography which was annoying. The animals looked unhappy although I saw a few animals I have not seen in North American zoos. I watched their reptile/nocturnal animal show. It was okay for younger families. I took a taxi back to the MRT but he was very rude as he was angry that I didn't want to pay a fare all the way back downtown.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"A fantastic attraction. Despite having pre booked tickets, we did still have to queue and that was for almost 2 hours. However, this is to be expected at such a popular attraction. The drive through was thoroughly enjoyed but could have been slightly longer. If I was to go again, I would definitely sum up the courage to follow the foot trail too! Wide array of animals, riveting to be so close to them!"
,,First Visit,5.0,,"Though am a local residing in Singapore. It's my very first visit to Night Safari.

It was a Saturday night. People here. People there. Lots of crowd. Joined the queue for tram. Queue at Tram Station 1. It was so packed that the operator opened up nearby Tram Station 2 to help to clear the queue. It was fortunate to have another queue, got on the tram after 20+ minutes wait. Flash photography not allowed.

The tram drove through different safari themes to see the animals' habitat. They was amazing beautiful and active at night. The zoo tram guide commentary in English was good. She shared about the creatures' habits etc. The tram ride was about 45 minutes. Cruising on the tram through the forested park was very cooling and relaxing. Really enjoyed.

Will consider coming back on a weekday again. Missed the night creatures show.

Interesting! Enjoyed!"
,,Highlight of the trip,5.0,,Definitely worth the pushing and shoving on opening. Well light for night time photography. Fire show at entrance spectacular.
,,"Long queue, very tiring",3.0,,"This is not the best place for young children if they have been up all day venturing Singapore Zoo or River Safari. I should have arranged a separate day for Night Safari, with minimal activity planned prior to the visit.

The queue to enter was overwhelming. Buy tickets online, that will save time. But be prepared to stand in line as if you're entering a concert. It's packed, really packed. And I thought Sunday night will have less crowd. Once in you have the option to take the tram or walk on your own. We were too tired to walk so tram it is! Another queue for tram! One thing though, the crowd was organized although there were inconsiderate people cutting queues.

I don't think the zoo itself was anything interesting. You get to see probably more things by walking, but we didn't, it was too tiring with 2 young kids after the River Safari.

Food is expensive but taste good. We had dinner at Ulu Ulu restaurant... It's a for court with a variety of food, pricey though.

The opening fire show happens every hour from 7pm. Each show lasts 15 minutes, which is when the crowd is allowed to enter.

Again, if you have young kids, ensure they are well rested. The crowd is massive, the waiting is tiring. If you're on your own, go as late as possible.

Definitely no second visit for the next few years at least. Night Safari was a nightmare for us."
,,Animals come alive,5.0,,"One of the three zoos in Singapore and a must to visit to complete the outing (if you are doing zoo /river safari during the day)!
The tram brings you to most of the places but not all all but imo, it is great as you have a light breeze along the ride which helps heighten the experience..

Visit after dinner, less people and therefore hearing the animals better.. closer to nature.."
,,Worth the time but not the money.,4.0,,"Be prepared to spend a big sum of money for the food and drink. ( bring your own if can )
The night show is actually quite short compared to last few year when i went.
Do go there at 7.15 or 8.15 for sufficient time to roam around and in order to get back by bus, as their last bus is at 12.15am.
Do take the tram to zebra cafe and walk the trail ( map is given at the counter ) and then take the tram again to see more animals that are unable to see by walking.
Overall the trip is quite fun, but you will be shock how much you spend for their food and drink if you eat there."
,,night safari Zoo,3.0,,Nice to learn about and see animals in their night habitat....However we had a 1 and1/2 wait to get to the gate to go into the Zoo ...it was hot and humid ....Then we had another long wait to board the train ...other wise it was a very interesting night
,,Night Visit,3.0,,"I visited at night and went on the night train around park. Very disappointed as very hard to view animals and commentary not particularly good. Waiting time with booked time 45 minutes. Would suggest skipping the ride and walking around, see much more."
,,Controlled chaos,4.0,,"At first we were daunted by the long lines to ride the tram, but once we boarded the tram we enjoyed the ""safari""...it was great seeing the animals in more of a natural habitat. I have mixed feelings about zoos, but I think they do a great job in promoting knowledge and conservation of animal species."
,,A wow experience,5.0,,"I have seen many zoos, but this the only night zoo experience I ever had. The train ride is helpful, but you can also walk to all areas. Superb are the öfters. Stay here for some time. You will love their playing behaviour. Many other Highlights! Don't miss it. You rarely have a Chance to see such a thing."
,,Awesome family night.,5.0,,"We made a booking for the safari online and rocked up a day early by mistake. Our guide (Roy) changed our booking, put us on a priority tram, organised reserved seating for the animal show afterwards (we were unable to attend though due to our kids being tired) and looked after us brilliantly. His service made our experience a memorable one and we cant thank him enough. The tram was fantastic and informative and our kids loved seeing the animals. Its such a great zoo and worth the visit.
TIP- ask customer service if you can pay for priority tram rides. It costs an additional $10/ person but it means you don't wait HOURS for your turn in the long line."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"This is the best place to see animals roaming freely at night.Its like a zoo.There is tram which takes us around the zoo at night and we can see various wild animals .It's real fun watching them free.There are eateries also but quite expensive. One must visit this safari whole visiting Singapore.
."
,,Too small,3.0,,The zoo was clean and pretty neat but the animals are kept in tiny spaces. I felt so sorry for them. Skip the creatures of the night. Very boring
,,night trail.,5.0,,"a nice place to visit for first timers.more fun thing if you have kids along.typical bus ride,walking trail."
,,A little disappointing. I think the zoo is a better all round experience,3.0,,We chose to do what is called the safari expedition tour i.e. Your ticket covers both the river safari and the night safari (not entrance to the zoo). One of the traps of doing it this way is that the river safari which you usually arrive at around 2:30pm takes only a couple of hours to complete. The tour guide doesn't go with you. They just hand over the tickets and give you the instructions. The night safari however doesn't open until 7pm which leaves you 2.5 - 3 hours with time to kill. Not an easy feat unless you pay the extra to enter the zoo area. There is a pre-opening fire show but unless you are standing at the ropes it's not the best view. The best view comes from the burger place next to the show platform but you need to have bought food or a drink to sit in the area. Our guide returned at 7:15 to take us inside for the night animal show. This was informative but a little disappointing and I don't know how many times the Rangers have to ask people to not use a flash because it effects the animals before they'll listen. We were obviously with a deaf crowd. At the end of the show we went on the train ride but in a seat of 4 you really are limited to only seeing the animals on one side. This took around 40 minutes after which time the guide told us we now had time for dinner as the bus would not be returning until 10pm. We had been in the humidity for nearly 9.5 hours with little reprieve from breeze or cooling stations. We would never do it this way again. It is too difficult and too exhausting and with too much time having to be filled in with sedentary activities.
,,Much better than I expected.,5.0,,"Such a nice place. When I realized there wasn't much to do in Singapore and that the shopping malls, zoos and amusement parks was what usually tourist do I felt disappointed. But once you get into this it is really great

I didn't expect to see so many animals. Actually I can say I could see all of them and they are very close to you. It is an amazing experience and if you are in Singapore you must do it.

Make sure to arrive as early as you can. If you like animals you will feel you are short of time."
,,Night at the Zoo,4.0,,"What a great idea - letting guests experience nocturnal animals when they are awake. We started off watching the Thumbuakar fire breathing performance - that is a must see, those men can do things with fire I have never seen. We then did a walking tour of the park - you see more that way and it gave time for the line for the Tram to die down. We then jumped on the tram - you really should do the tram tour this is the only way to see some of the animals. Then we saw the creatures of the night show - very clever. The otters were very cool. I really enjoyed how the park had such a conservation message."
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore you should definitely visit the night safari. Situated next to Singapore zoo and the river safari, this will make you sit in a tram which will then pass through various animals enclosures and you can see them in the night."
,,Great place to see on your visit to Singapore,5.0,,"The best zoo I have ever been to, Singapore always seems to get their attractions right. Doesn't even feel like you are in a zoo."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Definately worth a visit if you like animals .. You have the option of walking round or getting the tram, do both! You miss things out if you don't :)"
,,The night tour is nice!,4.0,,The night tour is nice and definitively worth a visit. We saw a lot of kids but I am not sure if it's appropriate for children smaller than 4.
,,Not bad but not amazing,3.0,,"For years, we've been very curious about this place. And finally last May 2016, we finally decided to visit the place. It was around 9PM when we entered the park.The park was not crowded at all and we took the tram ride immediately. In fairness to the staff, they are very attentive and helpful. But overall the experience is not good compared to our visit to Singapore Zoo. I would rather visit the Singapore Zoo (again) rather than the Night Safari."
,,Go early and do the walking trail first!,5.0,,"This is VERY close walk from the Singapore Zoo literally next door. When the zoo closes can eat at food court in between and then catch the first available entrance to the Night Safari. Most people head straight to tram tour or animal show. We elected to do the relatively deserted walking trails first; good call. Did the tram tour later with much less wait, also a good experience. Take a park map and watch your step in the semi-dark and you will be fine. Used that map a lot as do quite a bit of winding around. A unique experience that we have not seen elsewhere, so recommend this highly."
,,Great place to have a night walk,5.0,,"I have been here many times, I love it because you can do the typical bus-train ride or just walk in the trails and visit your favourite creatures. A great place and a great walk with company or just by yourself"
,,Don't go - daytime zoo Much better,2.0,,"Family 3 adults & 2 X 12 yr olds - &195

Hopeless and So over priced.
Full of rude tourists - they cram too many people in.
The creatures of the night show is So lame - I was cringing !
When It finished, every one rushes out to get the tram for the zoo tour.
The tram moves very slowly & really not many animals to be seen. 1 good pic of flamingos - big deal

It cost us $195.00 - complete waste of money.

The daytime zoo is great and much better value So do that instead !"
,,Fun for kids,5.0,,This safari is a must for all the first time travellers to Singapore. The ride was fun for kids and for adults as well.
,,Not something extraordinary,3.0,,Is not that extra ordinary. You can skip this if you done have time. It started raining heavily when we were there. So it ruined our experience.
,,U gonna Love It !,5.0,,"ah so wonderful...Thats how i remember Night safari..never have been so up close with Lions,fox and hyenas (they are roaming freely mind you, with only a small artificial canal / pit between your good self & them )..and that animal show is superb..Kids will cherish every moment...
Do check weather forecast though..avoid visiting on rainy days as some activities are cancelled during rains.."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,This is one of the most amazing attractions of Singapore. The tram takes you through the guided tour of the park. The tour begins with the fire show which was amazing. Being in such close proximity with such magnificent animals is a very rare experience.
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,"We booked our trip to Singapore Night Safari at Singapore Zoo through Viator.

Sadly it was a night in the last week of school vacations & seriously, every school age child in Asia was there that night.

Our guide was a frazzled mess, she simply could not cope with keeping 17 people together.

We chose the optional meal with our tour. The food was awful, dried out, tasteless & not much to choose from. But worse was how rushed it was, the guide kept harassing us to finish but when we did we then had to wander about in hot, humid, crowded conditions waiting for the next stage.

We were then boarded onto 'trams' for our Safari, which wound it's way past various animals. Visibility was poor, & almost every animal was difficult or impossible to see.

We then waited for an hour for our bus back to the hotel.

For such a well known & well promoted attraction, we felt very disappointed & frankly 'ripped off'. The tour & meal was relatively expensive & we considered it very poor value for money."
,,A highlight and a must see,5.0,,"I must say i was slightly sceptical before i went....its another zoo.

Well it become probably a highlight of my trip and something i would easily say i would repeat visit.

Getting there can be a pain in the ..... and get back to ! But its worth it.

My tip is avoid the tour bus as soon as you go in - either walk around the zoo or go see the show then come back for the bus. The bus is the first thing swamped when the gates open."
,,"watch what animal, birds in park do in night",3.0,,the safari tram moves really slow and in the dark of the evening. I could see only few of the animals/birds they spoke about. The safari was also very short. Waiting time in the queue to board the safari tram was almost an hour for us.
,,Nice small wild life trip for 1st timers,3.0,,Very well kept and maintained by the authorities with good display and audio information about the animals. Though if you have seen the big wildlife parks you can give this place a miss
,,Night show and safari,5.0,,If you go to sigapore you should go and participate in night safari At first you go too see night show with animals after that you get on a long cars and see animals very quietly!
,,A different look at animal life,4.0,,"The night safari gives a different experience to look at the nocturnal wild life, and is quite exciting to see some of the big cats in their natural habitat. I would recommend walking down the fishing cat and leopard trails, and complete the circuit by riding on the tram from station 3 onwards. The show is good, don't miss it! It is advisable to get some dinner before you enter the night safari, and there are good options right at the entrance. However, the food joints gets really crowded, so be there early. If you are coming back using bus/MRT, be sure to check the last bus/train timings."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Really enjoyed our evening visit to the zoo. We paid for a 'tour' which meant that we skipped the long queues, which I would recommend. Beautifully maintained, slightly disappointed by the tram tour, could have been a little slower to spend a little more time searching for the nocturnal creatures. Overall happy"
,,repetative,4.0,,"the experience is nice and average , animals are sedated i guess and too predictable tour, the firework is the only saviour."
,,An Overpriced Tour,2.0,,"Buffet
We booked the Asian buffet dinner. It was fair priced and the food was generally delicious, better than I expected actually. However, they have arranged us to a non-air-conditioned dining area when there were seats inside. Yet, the one thing that really let us down was the dessert. There were flies surrounding them and ants crawling on the plate with cream puff. Disgusting!

Tram tour
We only got time to ride the tram and it was the most poor travel experience I have ever had. It was too dark to see anything and of course I understand that we must not disturb the animals but there must be something they can do to help us see right? Say like distributing infra-red devices? It was so boring that I actually fell asleep! However, what really angers me was its broadcasting system. It makes me feel like their whole preserving stuffs were SHAM and that they are only trying earn our money. It was their instruction to keep our volume low, but they just totally ignore their own rules and broadcast their introductions of animals loudly through their speakers on the tram!!! They should have totally used a headset system instead! Totally recommend not to visit.
P.S. The reason why we could only ride the tram was because the queue for the tram was so long! It totally reflects their poor management! Don't they know how to relieve congestion?

Design of the park
When we were riding the tram, 99.9% of the animals were on the right. So if you are like me, siting on the left, you are most likely done! That's is the very reason why I fell asleep, dark and nothing to see! What a poor design!"
,,Night Activity in Singapore,5.0,,"Take the rail within to see the massive landscape and the animals walk freely. There are great shows in the area, look for the schedules. Good tasting local food in the vicinity."
,,Spend some quality time with your family,5.0,,"I never seen such a controlled environment, excellent planning and such nice trails. Don’t forget to recommend your friends who are visiting Singapore. You can spend a quality time with your family and I believe you will never forget this visit & time spent together throughout your life.."
,,Great experience with cool animals,5.0,,"Having been to both the day and night zoo, I can say the night zoo is something different to most other zoos and a great way to see nocturnal animals more active. Stock up on Mosi spray as there are understandably quite a few around. Get the train car to get up close with some of the african heard animals and see a lot without sweating too much. Defo worth a visit."
,,Night Zoo trip,5.0,,"This is part of a four park ticket, or can buy separately, but does make it really long day if you do Zoo and night safari on same day (can be split, you pick day you want to go) Queues were not good, needs fans and water sprays as you have to stand for a long while. Option of walking or going on noddy train. Can get off at one stop. You see animals not seen during day in main zoo. Very different experience but worth it"
,,A welcome accident...,5.0,,"This was not originally on my itinerary, but I found myself stranded in S'pore and went on my last night. You can take the open air tram that rides through (it's captured the hokey feeling of Jurassic Park - or the other way around?) - you can also get off and walk. It takes a while to get there on public transport (1.5 hours) from the center so leave early! (The last public transport back leaves around 11 pm) You will need around 2.5 hours for a pleasant unhurried visit."
,,Totally Amazing Experience,5.0,,Night Safari is a must visit place in Singapore. It opens at 7 PM and is open until midnight. Reaching there by 7:30 is a good idea so that you can catch the 8 o clock fire show and then 8:30 Creatures of The Night show. After that walk the trails and then take a tram ride. The animals here are truly magnificent and the environment in which they are kept is commendable. A very well maintained Zoo and a must must visit place once in Singapore. Do not miss it at any cost.
,,it's not so good as expected,2.0,,it's a little bit far away from downtown. the animals are so quite and lazy without savagism. the night show is quite boring and so short I have to say.
,,interesting..but not so much,3.0,,"I saw the fire show, and it is interesting. but the show in the amphitheater was too much talk..and not so interesting. Cute animal..yes... but the show is just an average.
I think we have to had a lot of luck to see all the animal... because most of the animal are hiding, and we can not see all the animal."
,,Good fun !,4.0,,We had a very good time at the night safari. The show with the animals is really good fun. A very special thank to Leslie for looking after us so well and advising us about how to best schedule our time there.
,,Not organized well,3.0,,"The actually zoo and the animals were very good. All the animals were awake and generally easy to spot. My only problem is that it seemed to be very unorganized. You had to line up, then line up again just to get in. Then you had to join a huge line again if you wanted to do the tram ride!! Luckily I had read another review on TA who said ""skip the tram ride at the beginning and go left and walk the trails first"". Great advise as there was barely anyone else doing that and if felt like you had the zoo all to yourself. Then do the tram at the end. Overall I would recommend going, but be prepared for lots of standing around before you actually get in."
,,Long waits tire you,3.0,,"We visited the place on a Friday night. We reached at 715pm and managed to get the tickets for 815pm entry. After waiting for 90 mins we got some place in the tram and the tram ride was for little over 40 mins.

I guess the place is good for kids. For adults its a zoo ride in the night not really a safari. Can skip if you are tight with budget or time"
,,Check out the night zoo,4.0,,"It would've been too hot to comfortably enjoy the zoo during the day so the night zoo makes a great option. We really enjoyed the unique zoo experience and had fun walking around at night to explore all the animals. It definitely surprised us. It wasn't originally on our ""must see"" list but it was recommended by a friend. We were glad we decided to check it out!"
,,Hardly a safari,1.0,,This is just an extension of the zoo at night. Nothing exciting and surely cannot be called a safari. Do not expect anything remotely close to africa.
,,Take a deep breath...,3.0,,"We booked the early viewing at 715 and wowzor were we in the ""line ride"". Absolute anarchy with people pushing and shoving certainly not adult behaviour....

Once we got in and separated from the crowd we enjoyed the experience but no sooner was it ruined again at the creatures of the night show with rude and ignorant patrons.

Not the parks fault but they could certainly instill some order..."
,,Night Safari in reality,5.0,,"Night Safari is a thrilling experience with worth of penny spent on ticket.
The whole tour is arranged is mini-train with full discipline. You get info at each point on the animal which present in dark. No flash camera is allowed but you can do video without flash.
I watched tiget, lion, elephant, dear, wolves, hippotamus, so many animals at one place.
A must for each visitor to enjoy.
You also enjoys some fire shows at the entrance ."
,,A very different zoo experience,4.0,,"This was a suggestion by a friend for a different thing to do in Singapore, and I enjoyed wandering through the forests at night seeing the animals up and around, on the prowl and active.
The tram is great to get your bearings then it's fairly easy to wander around the four trails.
It's also open till late so a great activity to fill an evening in.
Only two things, firstly, there is no flash photography allowed, so unless you have an amazing low light camera capability, leave it at home, along with your smart phone.
Secondly, if your afraid of bats this experience will defiantly have you on edge, as small fruit bats and flying foxes are flying around every where!"
,,Really cool experience with managed expectations.,5.0,,"The night zoo is really a neat experience that is 100% worth the visit.

There are a number of paths that you can explore on your own and you can also do a tram tour. Doing both is a must, there are certain animals that you'll only see on the tram and vice versa. Because it's dark out, you can't walk the tram road as you can in the day zoo.

The trail experience was neat, it is remarkably quiet, I swear I was totally alone 70% of the time. However, you have to manage expectations. Because it is night and dimly lit you can't always see the animals well, sometimes not at all.

The tram ride was also awesome. There is absolutely no barrier between you and the animals for many of them which allows for some great viewing.

I'd recommend getting to the Zoo area at 3:00 pm, and first checking out the day zoo. It's a little cooler at that time and gives you three hours to check out the day zoo which is a bit tight but doable. You can then transition over to the Night Zoo which opens at 7:30 pm. The joint ticket is about $65 SD. There is a pretty big line-up that starts up at 7 pm. I'd suggest having some food and drinks until 7:45 pm to let the line dissipate. The line to the trams will be huge still so start by checking out the trails. Once you're done with the trails, say around 9:00 pm, go on a tram. You'll have no line-up. Wait until it's about to leave so you can hopefully sit at the very back in a fully unoccupied row so that you can shift from left to right as need be.

It is a bit tough to get there on transit, sky train + bus which could take from 80 minutes to 2 hours. I'd recommend taking the sky train to Marsilling station and then take a cab from there to cut it down to 40 min. It will set you back about $13 SD each way, cheaper if you share a cab of course.

Food and drinks are crazy expensive so you'll want to budget for that."
,,Good but big crowds.,3.0,,"The Safari tram ride it self was quite good but not a lot more than you would see during the day. The crowd for 7.15pm was massive and all packed in shoulder to shoulder, several tour coaches had arrived at once. Having said that the crowd was well behaved and after they opened the gate it took around 45min to get on the tour tram."
,,Night safari is the best Zoo attraction,5.0,,The tram service and the trails in the night are good. Do catch the fire show which happens just outside multiple times in the night.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,We were very disappointed with this attraction. It's not worth visiting as you can hardly see anything. The animals are hardly visible and most were asleep or lying down so hard to detect. The food inside the park was expensive. Very disappointing indeed. You're better off going to the zoo.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We did the combined ticket and went to the aqua park first.
the night safari is a must! You will never witness anything like it again. The animals are very active and you have a guides tour first and then free to Rome certain trails after.

We went for the first viewing and it was a bit chaotic getting into the tour tram. ..but once on it was brilliant!

There is food there which isn't too bad price wise and transport (bus taxi ) is readily available on leaving the venue"
,,this is for animal lovers!!!!!,5.0,,A good activity to be out of your busy schedule where your hustle bustle experience would definitely give you the bets experience of being out and have fun with your loved ones and friends!!!!!
,,Excellent,5.0,,A must see. Nocturnal animals in as close to there natural environment. You take a tram about the park. Lit well enough to see but not enough for pictures. No camera flash allowed so as not to startle the animals or hurt their eyes. You can also walk paths right next to their habitats. Give yourself at least three to four hours if you plan on riding and walking.
,,Grumpy staffs & super long queues,3.0,,"The night safari is supposed to be world class but is mended by unfriendly & grumpy staffs. They only greet people selectively. Ridiculously long queues for the tram ride. Half of the aggressive animals were sedated thought these animals were nocturnal. Tigers, lions & tapirs looked sedated & were lying down as the tram went round..saw mostly the non-aggressive animals like deers, pigs, elephant & giraffe by tram. Even the hyenas were in hiding. My suggestion is skip the long queue for the tram & walk instead via the fishing cat trail to the east lodge trail. Take a break there for some snacks then make your way to the wallaby trail & to the naracoorte cave. These attractions are new & worth visiting. For those who still want to take the tram take it from the east lodge instead. It's a walk from the fishing cat trail & less crowded. I would given the night safari a 4 star rating if not for the poor customer service & ridiculously long waiting time to board the tram as well as sedated animals."
,,Lovely ride,4.0,,"It's worth availing this opportunity. It's well planed and guided ride for three hours. They take u Singapore flyer, garden where one can watch super trees with lovely music n lighting arrangements. Then marina bay and Bugis street. Busses are available at suntec city area. U may include river cruise also it's optional. All ages people can enjoy this ride. Ticket is quite reasonable. I think first bus leave at 6pm."
,,Waste of time in night safari,2.0,,"All old animals and no fun ,it doesn't add to charm and the feel of night jungle safari. only the animal show is intresting"
,,Very poor,2.0,,Who says its a must watch?? It was pathetic. The rivers safari is still better and the zoo is good. This should be taken out of the top list for sure.
,,Experience,2.0,,- food was very expensive - some night animals hardly active - free tram services was slow. We walk half the park so as not to waste time in q before we manage to board the tram for tour -
,,"Amazing experience, maybe we got lucky?!",5.0,,"Booked this trip through Viator and paid about £90 for 2 people. For this we got priority boarding (10 minute queue vs 90 minute queue), transfers to and from the zoo, buffet meal and expert guide advice from the amazing Joyce.

Read a lot of mixed reviews on here, but if you pay the extra money it takes away so much of the pain and was an excellent experience. Maybe we got lucky, but we saw every animal pretty much barring giraffes (my favourite!), but we saw 2 lions play fighting, a tiger 3 yards away and 3 hippos very close by moving around, amongst so many others.

Genuinely is one of the best trips out we have ever had."
,,ANIMALS,5.0,,Their animals were fascinating and shows also. Shopping is very expensive but slush is vey goooood. tiger looked tired of seeing too many tourists
,,Fire Dance Performance is a Must,5.0,,"The Fire Dance is totally worth watching. Make sure to watch it first upon entering. I missed the Fire Dance on my first trip to Night Safari because we went for the Tram Ride first (thinking that we might miss it because of the long queue). So on our second trip, we made sure to wait for the performance first before anything else. Don't worry about the Tram Ride as you can still catch it after the Fire Dance performance."
,,Enjoyment of visit depends on how active the animals are,3.0,,"Similar to a lot of zoos your enjoyment depends on whether the animals are active and in sight. The extra difficulty is that it is at night. The animals that you do see are quite interesting in the main. The show was a waste of time as you barely saw each animal before they were taken off.
Would not go again."
,,Really enjobale with kids,4.0,,"A truly original experience on a night tour, especially for kids. Facilities are outstanding, watch out for the schedules starting at 1900 hrs, lines could be long. Get there early. Several options for dining right outside."
,,"Fantastic, unique, must do experience",4.0,,Lots of queues and we thought we could walk the whole zoo but it turns out you have to take the tram (once we did get on there was no queues). However that didn't damper what was an amazing experience. This is well worth it. Very unique and a lovely evening. We were exhausted by the end as we did three parks on the one day but it was truly lovely
,,Good Experience,4.0,,"The place gives you a good look at all the animals in their natural habitat, however some animals are difficult to spot due to low lighting & poor visibility.Also if you take the tram ride, you need to constantly keep looking on both your sides in order not to miss sight of any animals.Overall a wonderful place - avoid going on a weekend."
,,Night Safari - a Singapore Must Do activity,4.0,,"Singapore has one of the few night zoo programs in the world. The program is structured around seeing nocturnal animals in their habitats during their normal active times. The range of animals, and the structure of the habitats are relatively good, as you can get pretty close to many of the animals. While there are a number of other activities like shows, eating, and shopping; the animals are the star of the attraction. The shows are ok, but time is better spent seeing the animals. Coming from another part of the world, there a number of animals native to Asia that I have never had the opportunity to see before.

Recommendation: Do the walking tour first. The night safari has both a tram and a set of walking trails. First the tram lines are long and the wait times are excessive - easily cured by walking. You can see more animals, and can spend more quality time with the exhibts if you walk. If you want to get something to eat, get there with plenty of time in advance to stand in line, order and eat before the night sessions start.

The last part of the zoo can only be seen by riding in the tram. We did this later in the evening - there was no wait."
,,Annoyed by disobedient vistiors,3.0,,"On a friday nite we arrived around 7. Tickets easily obtaines. Very loooong queue to join the tram ride. Too bad a recorded text was played while on the tram, replacing a live guide on each tram, makes it more industrilzed. The life guide speaking on the tram was much more misterious. Visitors still talking out loud and make flash photographs. So annoying. Seems India having a holiday period, which was 70% of its visitors. Price too high for quality deliverd, way too much. Had a burger at Bongo's for 17 s$, ridiculously highly priced. The french fries were not even fried well, still raw potato taste, bring your own food please.
Soooooo expensive: entrance fee and food. Singapore zoo is better visiting."
,,You'll see it nowhere else,5.0,,"It is one of the kind experience of a zoo at night! Unfortunatelly it is too dark to take pictures (flash is prohibited as it scares the animals) but you just have to see it. All sort of nocturnal animals that you even didn't know are nocturnal. Hop on the train for a pleasant ride around the safari, but I would suggest to do it later as the lines to it tend to be really long. Walk around 4 walking trails and join one of the last train rides to avoid waiting. Don't miss the animal show, especially when with kids."
,,Something different.,3.0,,"Night safari was a bit of a different experience for us. We arrived at abt 8pm and had to queue in a sea of people. It was really stuffy with people trying to enter the park but the entertaining fire show just before the entrance distracted us from thinking how stuffy and long the queue was. It really would have helped if there was a big fan scattered here and there.

Since we were there with our 6 year old son and our 71 year old mom, my husband decided to pay extra $10 each (if im not mistaken) for the express lane. So glad he did that because we managed to cut the queue (a lot!)

The tram was a pleasant ride. However there wasnt much to see most probably due to extreme dim lighting. The journey was very informative and took quite a while (quite worth the queue outside).

We ended the night with the animal show which was quite entertaining. Night safari could try and improve though everything though in terms of queue system for families with elderly and place fans for some cold air while queuing."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a very nice idea, where you can see the animals at night after a visit to the zoo. The tram ride does not take too long. You can even walk down the trails and see the animals. We didn't do so because we were exhausted. The animals are fed in the evening and so you get to see all of them."
,,Night Safari Fun,4.0,,"We enjoyed the night safari as a whole - we were unfortunate however to visit Singapore during the Haze and it also rained but we still managed to walk round the park and enjoy the exhibits. The highlights included watching the staff feed the wild dogs and taking the bus around the park. Give yourself plenty of time to walk the whole park. The quees for the actual safari component were quite lengthy but I always expect to wait for these types of attractions and the food prices were expensive but once again this seems to be standard for zoos, aquariums across the world so didn't really change my opinion of the zoo. Quite a distance from the city and a bit expensive in a taxi."
,,Very average,3.0,,"I went here as it had been recommended by other people. However, I found it far too commercialized. During the safari, we only saw a few animals and I honestly didn't find it very exciting. I've been on safari yours in Africa before and this just didn't compare. The creatures of the night tour was very well done. However, it was slightly ruined by inconsiderate tourists who didn't listen to the presenters many reminders that flash photography was forbidden as it scared the animals away."
,,Well conceived Concept,4.0,,"we are made to travel through battery operated vehicles though the Zoo walk throughs.Tram safari. Nice concept and well organised.Even though it is well covered, they can spend few more seconds near every enclosures.Creatures Night Show is informative and teaches human a lot of lesson, ONE MORE PLACE TO BE VISTED IN SINGAPORE"
,,Queues too much,4.0,,"Timed tickets but the queues were massive for the trams. The safari itself is nice, although the number of stupid people still using flash photos even after being told not to was annoying."
,,Not as cool as it sounds.,3.0,,"I wasn't expecting to see tigers and elephants wandering around amongst people, but I was expecting more than just a normal zoo experience. What I found, however, was just that this zoo is dark with a few lights here and there to help visitors see the animals, which most of the time they are just sleeping. It's less exciting because you really can't see much, but the zoo experience and diversity is essentially the exact same as a daytime zoo. The only unique thing about the night side was being about to see a small handful of nocturnal animals on motion, like the bat cage."
,,Must visit to experuence wildlife at night,4.0,,This was the first time I experienced wildlife at night! The place is located little far from the main city but you will have bus connectivity that will drop you right outside. I took bus 138 from Ang Mo Kio bus terminal which dropped me right outside the Night safari. Reach there by 8 to enjoy the tram ride and then walk by the trails. I could just see ine show where they bring in some trained animals. However there is one more show that happens which is great as I have heard. You can inquire about the shows
,,Disappointing place,1.0,,"The night safari was quiet disappointing. Half the wild animals could not be spotted viz; Tigers, Giraffe etc.,. One has to travel quite a distance from city centre to reach night safari. Have to wait at least 1/2 an hour to board the tram.Rather it was not worth the trouble and expenses. Better avoid night safari, instead visit Jurond bird park"
,,Busy!,4.0,,"Went to night safari after river safari. headed there at 6.00 for 7.15 booking. decided we would have a drink and eat dinner. well........ first take plenty of money as drinks and food very over priced. Jug of tiger beer $50. Most meals $15 upwards ++. took us 30 min to just get in the gate as the crowd was massive, only to have to wait for another 15 min to get on the tram that takes you around. Only thing I would suggest is to go late as possible to park to avoid family groups with kids as they come and leave early. Once on the tour it was great and lots of animals to view."
,,"Ok, queues can be quite long",2.0,,"We booked this tour as something to do during the night and it was ok. The safari itself is made up of trails and a tram ride. Highly recommend if you want to visit this to do it with a tour and spend the extra couple of dollars to skip the queue, at time we went there was hundreds of people waiting for the tram. We were lucky enough to skip the queue otherwise would have been for a boring time. The place also has plenty of places to eat but bring your walking shoes as there are some good animals to see if you don’t mind the leg work. The unfortunate thing though letting it down is that the animals seem to be bored with the countless number of trams travelling in their area and look placid"
,,"""ZZZZZZZZ""",2.0,,"i was expecting night life or animals of the dark, instead what was shown are day animals so they were just standing around on dark light. you see lion sleeping, deer standing, rhino standing. so if you want to wonder around the park on the train, bring along your pillow because after falling in line for a long time, you will be treated to a path of sleepy animals."
,,Great for Families,3.0,,"We took a tour from the hotel which meant we spent more time on the bus than we did at the Zoo. If you go I would recommend trying to organize it on your own. The tram ride was awesome and there were lots of animals to see, which was by far the best part. But there were so many people which meant you had to wait in line for everything."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,"Reach this place by 5 pm to experience the first ride available by tram . We went for 7:15pm show and the crowd is very high in number. It took 30 min for us to board the tram.

If you want to explore this place by walk better take an entry in afternoon"
,,Wastage of time!!!!😞,2.0,,Not recommend as there is huge crowd and need to stand in queue for more than 2 hours to take tram. Also there is darkness and difficult to view animals. But fire show after jungle visit is awesome. Must watch. Recommend river safari or Singapore zoo if gives better experience rather than night safari.
,,Very Well organized !! I expected More,4.0,,"Night Safari is a good experience, but not an exhilarating one. The tourists are taken in an electrically operated cart around the multiple exhibits of herbivore and carnivore animals. The challenge is because of low lighting conditions spotting animals is difficult. The experience was similar to an experience in zoo instead of a safari. Though they have certain trails following which we can locate the nocturnal animals. They also have a live show, involving the animals which is quite interesting.In low lighting conditions, you would not be able to take photos as flash is not allowed."
,,It din't really do it for us,3.0,,"My mistake really, a Night Safari trip to see anaimals. We did not see as much as we thought we would see, but we were both exhausted from travelling across the world, so perhaps this is not a fair reflection. All I would say, really, is check out very thoroughly just what you are going to see"
,,Night tour - din't really see that much,3.0,,"I have to say that this review is probably a bit unfair really - we had very limited time in Singapore so we opted to do a Night Safari tour with RMG Tours - very well organised, and would use them again, but a night tour does not really enhance a zoo experience. My fault, not anything to do with the zoo - I would say MUCH better to go in daylight!"
,,Great zoo apart from visitors noise,3.0,,"We had been to zoo many years ago and throughly enjoyed it so decided a repeat visit was in order. Was also warned about large, noisy families, and yes, we struck it unlucky.
The family we shared the tram with did not take any notice of the polite reminders posted around the zoo that silence is necessary and talked loudly through out the first half of our tram ride.
We got off here to try to avoid the noise. it worked and the second part of the journey was very pleasant. .
This zoo is unique and would have been a great experience if it wasn't for the thoughtlessness of other visitors.
Perhaps the zoo officials could take a harder approach on the noisy visitors. i would not go to zoo again and unfortunately would not recommend the experience."
,,Animals in the dark,4.0,,"The night safari was a very different experience. We arrived at our booked time of 7.15pm. Once you have got into the safari the queue for the tram was large so we did the trails to do on foot first. It was dark but all the walk ways were flat with no steps or unexpected uneven surfaces. We had had a bit of rain so I would recommend wearing shoes rather than flip flops as some areas were slightly slippery. The animals were well kept but as it was dark could be difficult to see so there was a bit of luck involved, we did find ourselves looking into dark glass fronted enclosures seeing nothing, but I don't want to be negative as we did also see a lot of beautiful animals. We went on the tram tour at about 9pm when there were no queues at all. That was a welcome sit down and nice and cool. The tram took about 40 minutes and took you to the places that you couldn't walk to and we saw the larger animals like elephants, rhinos, giraffe etc. We left the safari about 10pm having a very refreshing fresh juice on the way out. My son was hungry and got a bongo burger which was over priced, the chips we cold and the burger was so hot it had definitely been heated up in a microwave - would not recommend a bongo burger, but the rest of the safari was good. I think if you want to see animals the day zoo would be a better bet if you are deciding between one or the other."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Plan your schedule. Go by the tram in the end. Finish your trails first. Bcoz there s lots of waiting for the tram when the safari opens at seven. Great sights of the animals. Shows are also good. But a repetition of what we had seen many years ago. Still enjoyable.
,,Over Rated,3.0,,Singapore Night safari was good but it was much over rated .. too much tiring and nothing but just wondering around the jungle in a tram .. looking at the animals from far
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Nice concept, the Zoo was very busy with children, You would need a good camera to takeany pictures."
,,A new slant on a trip to the zoo!,4.0,,"Singapore Zoo does have a bit of a reputation for being ahead of the game, and their whole approach to the animal welfare is refreshing, you seldom see a cage and they rely on a system of ditches instead, ( I'm sure some very clever people worked out exactly how big the ditches needed to be so the visitors do not end up on the lunch menu for some of the animals!) During the day guests are pretty much able to walk around the exhibits at their own pace, at night it is a much more organised affair with most of the people movement being carried out with a fleet of road trains. First thing to keep in mind is the daytime park and night time park are run as 2 separate items with the day zoo shutting down at about 6 pm and the night zoo not opening till about 7 pm. Once you have your ticket you are held in a very large holding area and while you wait are entertained by a fire eating act - at first sight it has the potential for chaos, with queue jumpers, but that certainly did not happen. A large volume of people are quickly moved and cleverly split into separate lines, they operate a load and depart system many real railways would be proud off, handling several road trains at a time. The train idea is a clever one as it keeps the guests exactly where the staff need them to be and eliminates the potential for human nature to do some silly things which could be quite dangerous for both people and animals alike. As the train meanders its way around the exhibits, there is a useful guided commentary which tells you what is coming up and which side to look., the viewing areas are dimly lit and lunch has been provide for the animals to encourage them into the viewing areas, the system seems to work quite well, although like most daytime zoos there is a percentage of 'No Shows' but this is probably less than if you went during the day when the animals had decided to 'have a little nap!' The whole thing is well organised and puts a new slant on a trip to the zoo!"
,,So much to see so little time,4.0,,"I read the reviews prior to heading to the Night Safari and I was a little apprehensive - it sounded expensive for what you saw. Was I wrong! Get an early time because I was there for three + hours. They shuffle you in and like sheep everyone heads to the shuttle bus or the show. I saw the show which was excellent! Then like sheep again was herded to the shuttle bus. The animals are extraordinary!!! Once the bus is finished, everyone follows each other to the exit. Don't do it!! Divert from the crowd and follow the walking trail - I can't explain to you how amazing the walking trail is, so many animals missed from the bus tour. It's the walking tour where the real animal experience is at!!"
,,"Not that much to see. Crowded, expensive.",3.0,,"The animals were very interesting and commentary was good. On the downside the venue was crowded, hot and expensive. 50 Sgd for a jug of beer. Lol. All in all not a relaxing night. Home late and stinking hot from the outing. Shell shocked from the clatter of noisy pushy tourists."
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"Gates open at 7.15pm we joined the line at 6.55pm, it took nearly 30 minutes to get in the gate. So we missed the first show due to it being full. Joined the tram line and waited another 40 minutes for the tram ride. Saw a few animals strategically staged for our viewing pleasure but don't blink or you will miss them. Saw part of the live show at 9.30pm but due to theatrics and a proposal we saw very little before we had to catch a 10 bus back to the city.
Food is expensive and beer price ridiculously expensive at $13.50 for a smallish glass of Tiger"
,,Best experience but avoid weekend,4.0,,"I've visited this place on a weekend which made me wait for so long , but the tram experience and fire show were worth it. Everything was so good over there that maybe staff, services, safety etc."
,,"Plan ahead, and arrive early for the Night Safari",5.0,,"Is the Night Safari totally awesome? Yes. Is it outrageously popular? Absolutely. Each running sells out, and even if you have a voucher, you must still queue up to get your actual ticket.

My family arrived with vouchers thinking we were locked in for a 7:15 PM running. Unfortunately, both the 7:15 and the 8:15 running shoes were sold out, so we waited in line for over an hour and got into the 9:15. It was worth it in the end when we saw lions, elephants, rhinos and hippos all in their nocturnal element, but hopefully you will heed this and avoid the hassle we faced.

Also, getting taxi out is a major pain. Unless you arrange a car independently, you will wait in line for about an hour to get a taxi."
,,Night visit letdown,2.0,,"We had heard how great the night safari at Singapore Zoo was and were advised not to do,it by ourselves but to join a tour as groups get in quicker and the queues are long at the zoo. We booked though our hotel and were picked up by car at 5.45 pm then we picked up from another hotel and were taken to the "" bus depot"" where we had to purchase our tickets and we stood around for ages in the heat until finally we were loaded onto a bus for the 45 min drive to the zoo. When we arrived it was extremely busy and I thought we had arrived at India zoo not Singapore zoo then of course we had to queue again for about an hour or more in the humid heat until finally we got into our 'tram' for our safari ride. After being told numerous times not to take flash pics so as not to startle the animals,flashes were going off the whole time which was annoying for the people following instruction. We saw the usual jungle animals hyenas, elephants, lions, and tigers behind glass, but these were way outnumbered by deer of different types in every second pen and some Asian type cattle I was a little underwhelmed... We then had over an hour in the heat to fill in the before the bus was returning to Singapore we either had to look at some souvenir stalls, have not appealing takeaway food or queue up for a 20min ""animal show"" we chose to do the latter simply to fill in time. this so called show was really weak I doubt it would have even entertained the children in attendance . Finally we were on our way back to the city, at the first hotel stop we had to change buses to a mini bus and we were finally dropped off at our hotel at approx 11.30pm . Sorry for the marathon story but it felt like a marathon outing which was disappointing and I don't think I would bother if I had the time over....."
,,Must See!,5.0,,"We weren't sure what to expect having done the ""day""zoo. This trip is completely different. Our visit was under tour guide escort which proved to be amazingly beneficial. With approximately 3000 visitors every night, the tour guide managed to circumvent the 1-2 hour wait in queues for a tram which follows a set route in the dark to observe many nocturnal animals and creatures. The trams trip lasting about 30 minutes was followed by a walk on one of the several dimly lit tracks and a ""night""show of well trained (well mostly) and very cute animals - great for the kids. In all very enjoyable and an out of the ordinary zoo visit."
,,Zoo visit,5.0,,"Night safari is just next to zoo and must see on same day for tourists atleast.Very near to life experience with animals.Dont forget to watch show Creature of the Night,even if u have to wait."
,,Excellent Night Safari,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our Night Safari - this was the second time we had done it ( a few years back was the first ) & we took friends with us this time . Is extremely well done & the animals look very relaxed as the "" train "" goes past.
The next day we did the River Safari & Amazon cruise. Whilst we enjoyed the river safari we thought the Amazon was a bit of a waste of time as really saw very few animals & although relaxing was a bit of a waste of time.
Loved seeing the Panada but it was only a brief look as the heat made them choose to stay in the cool out of sight - the red pandas are very cute too. A great family venue"
,,Unique But...,3.0,,"This venue just isn't quite enjoyable. At least not for an older person who doesn't like to be bathed in sweat. I mean it is in the rainforest but I was so uncomfortable that nothing was probably going to impress me. I guess I have been to a lot if zoos and except for the region specific amimals, have seen most. We did walk all the trails. In total, from air conditioned bus pick up to bus drop, it was just over 4 hours. If heat doesn't bother you, it is fairly unique to see nocturnals by moonlight."
,,Not my cuppa tea,2.0,,"We attended the night safari and everything seemed contrived, animals were too well-behaved it seemed unnatural that we should be so close to them and they just stood there on their little patch of land"
,,Nice idea not executed well,2.0,,"I booked this following positive reviews and it being advertised as a must see. I was intrigued by the concept and thought this may be presented in a similar way to Longleat Safari Park in the UK but at night! Where animals are given large enclosures and allowed as close to a natural environment as you can get in captivity, what you actually get are animals in standard zoo size enclosures, struggling to see them in the dark and many were actually snoozing!
Had to queue quite a bit initially to enter the zoo but would advise arriving about 20mins before your booking. Would recommend one of the shuttle bus services costing s$10 for return journey.
It wasn't an awful trip but didn't live up to the hype."
,,Nice & scary,4.0,,Be there in time otherwise you will miss the Thumbuakar Performance . Take a tram ride with a guide of the zoo and then you can walk around the zoo along the trails which gets a little scary and adventurous coz it is night and dark with wild animals roaming around.
,,As real as the jungle,5.0,,"This is one of the best attractions of Singapore after Gardens of the bay. It offers you real feelong of being inside the jungle, specially if you walk thru'their trails which are not only mesmerising buy also brings you so close to the nature & animals that at times you wonder how is it possible! The trails are the best part. Nite Safari is also very good & takes you on those tracks not part of the trails. Lot of eating options doesn't let you down at all. It opens at 7pm but go arnd 8-8.30 pm when it becomes less rushy & you won't hv to wait in long queues. Their show was a big disappointment, maybe bcoz we saw the last one at 10.30pm & it got finished in barely 15-20 minutes with not much activities. When yu enter watch the show first, then go walking on their trails, eat something & in last go for safari which will give yu ample rest & recovery."
,,A different experience,5.0,,It was a nice experience to see the animals in the tram and the best thing is that there is a division or fence/glass for very few animals. You can also see the animals really closely without any disturbance but you can't click any pictures because flash is not allowed.
,,"Night Safari, avoid the weekends",4.0,,"We went on friday night.It is a great concept, but the crowds on this friday night was overwhelming. .An hour and a half to get on the tram and the food is way overpriced"
,,Close view of the animals.,4.0,,"Recommend booking the Night Safari with Dinner. Shuttle pick-up from hotel to main coach. Good, informative guide on the coach. The Indian buffet was very good and well presented. Various curries, rice, satay, salad, fresh fruit, ice cream. Tram ride with narration provided by a guide. The animals can be observed at very close quarters from the tram. Flash photography is prohibited. The walking trails enable you to observe various other animals. The fishing cat was amazing to watch as it literally fished for its own dinner. The show was well presented with some audience participation. A strong environmental message was well delivered. An excellent evening out."
,,Great chance to see nocturnal animals,5.0,,"This is a great idea and really well run. You get to see a whole bunch of animals who never appear in the day at the zoo.

Don't jump on the train straight away or you'll be queuing for a while. Instead, go and explore the other parts of the zoo first then as you start to tire then jump on and enjoy it with no queues :)"
,,GOOD TOUR,4.0,,"As the name suggests, this was an evening tour which started with a ride on a bumboat around the central area of the city with views of the high-rise blocks of commercial buildings as well as some buildings of historical interest and the Merlion etc. This was followed by a visit to Bugis Market and a trishaw ride around, principally, Little India. The evening ended with a visit to the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel, where we were, of course, served a Singapore Sling. This was a lovely evening, well organised and interesting."
,,No kids but still worth seeing! Rain Forest Adventure!,5.0,,"I was reluctant to go on a Saturday night, but it was actually really cool to see the animals at night and be driven around the rain forest in a tram. It's nice and cool. The food was actually really good as well. There are plenty of restaurants on your way out leaving the safari if you don't have time to eat prior."
,,Simply Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing experience. One of a kind in the world. The trail walks are more fun than the tram ride, as you get a near experience of walking into a real forest at night. Must visit !!"
,,Singapore family vacation,1.0,,"Night safari trip was a bust
Arrived 45 min early and first ride sold out
Despite getting in we discovered first show was full and had a 1 hour wait
No mosquitoes at all-- Most impressive
Too crowded
Poorly organized-- they should hire consultants from Disney land and change procedures in place
No crowd control
All shows full and you wait for hours
Animals not Very impressive
Not a place to visit if you have been to a world class Zoo before
Many other lovely unique Singapre attractions warrant attention"
,,unique experience,5.0,,"Another one of the "" Not to be missed"" attractions of Singapore. The Fire show was a added bonus. You get excellent Veg. Food at one of the Indian restaurents in the food court.Go early to avoid long queues ."
,,Night safari,5.0,,"This was my second visit to the safari. As usual people throng to this place to experience the animals in the wild and not caged. It is scary but an experience to see lions in front of you. Many species of the wild from hyenas, deers, giraffe , etc
The walking trails are a treat to be close to the wild animals and the shows are very good too. Very well organized"
,,Interesting night safari,4.0,,"We went for the night safari, and found it to be a very interesting experience. It would be nice to know how large the enclosures are, but the staff were good at getting the animals near to the front so they could be seen.

Make sure to get off the train and explore on foot, there's a lot to see!"
,,One of a kind -something I have never seen before,5.0,,This was one of the best experiences of our Singapore trip. You see animals from a small distance ! What a superb way to get closer to nature !Each animal is adopted by a specific company for their care . My son simply loved the experience and I was thoroughly mesmerized!!
,,Benchmark for zoos in the world,5.0,,Singapore zoo continues to impress. The enclosures dont look or feel like enclosures. You can interact with more animals than most other zoos and the night safari really feels like a safari. Great for all ages.
,,Great experience - rendezvous with the wild life,5.0,,"Once again , a great way to bring nature closer to you. Set in a natural forest, the night safari brings you close to animals who are raised in their natural habitat like surroundings.
Walking on the jungle trails, one can see the animals from very close distance ( it's pretty safe ) , say around a meter away from them.

The whole experience is really surreal."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"The zoo is an amazing place to visit. The night safari must be experienced there is nothing like this anywhere else. You feel like you really are on a safari at night, if is wonderful to see the animals and hear the night time sounds. You can also have a lovely meal there afterwards."
,,Good as usual,5.0,,"This is my 3rd visit to the night safari. although we missed the creatures of the night show as kids we very tired after a full day we still enjoyed.
It always impresses you.
Just make sure you reach the park atleast 1.30 to 2 hours before the show that you want to catch coz most of the days it has a lot of crowd. The waiting time maybe almost an hour for the tram ride which itself is 40 mins so if you dont wanna miss the show reach early."
,,A different experience,4.0,,One of the most visited place in Singapore. But you will not love it very much if you already been to jungle safari.its more like a zoo where the creatures are kept in their natural environment. U will certainly enjoy the tram ride and the tribal dance with fire.there are various restaurants to satisfy ur taste bud.It will take 40mins by car from little india.
,,Great experience but be prepared for the humidity and long queue,4.0,,"This attraction is constantly crowded because it is good! As a Singaporean who has been here on several weekdays, the queue never ease up. Lately it has implemented staggered timed entrance but the queue is still quite long.
Remember to bring fan and lots of water, if you perspire alot bring along a towel or a change of clothes.
The best way to enjoy this crowded is to do the walking trial first and enjoy the feeding sessions followed by the tram ride (much shorter q) at stop 3 which will end at the entrance of the night show. After the show, continue the tram ride at Stop 1 to complete your tour of the Night Safari.
Please do not use flash or speak loudly so the poor animals do not get stressed out."
,,Not really for adults,3.0,,"Maybe it's because we went too close to closing time, but I did not enjoy this place at all. I've been here once before in 2008 and I was surprised that the changes in the Show and the tour was minimal. I went with my husband and we were both bored throughout the whole visit. We barely saw any animals! When I went last time, I went with a big group, so we ended up entertaining ourselves. This time it was a waste of money."
,,A great experience,4.0,,"We booked this tour through our cruise ship. About a 40 minute drive from marina bay. The safari train is a bit like Disney's animal kingdom, but in the night. Saw heaps of animals and was very satisfied with what we saw. A very unique way to view animals. Worth the visit. We did not watch any shows, but did some walking trails instead."
,,Unique attraction,4.0,,"A unique attraction. It is great to experience the animals at night. The park is accessible through four walking trails that take you close to the enclosures at almost touching distance. These trails are designed as per the animals housed in that geographical region. The other way to see the animals in on the tram (separate ticket required) - some of the animals can only be seen by the tram as they don't figure on the walking trails. It is eerie in the beginning and thrilling... And then one gets used to it's one's eyes adjust. The walkways are well lit; the maps and directions on the property are clear; there are guides at check-points to help you out. The Creatures of The Night show is a must-see!
Note: reach at least one hour before opening time to secure early entry tickets. They let in people in three batches one hour apart 7:40,8:40 and 9:40pm - and as soon as you enter head for the Creatures of the night show and get that out of the way. The queues for entering into the park is huge!! So be there early. And then the queues for the tram is also lengthy... But a lot of the visitors just take the tram ride and they are lazy to do the trails so the queues become less. Ask the staff to guide you to plan your visit after you enter. They are very helpful.
Note: THERE IS NO DRINKING WATER FOUNTAIN OR RESTAURANT INSIDE THE PARK SO CARRY LOTS OF WATER. The restaurants are outside the park and they allow one to step outside with a re-entry stamp on the hand.
It is a fabulous experience.
Plan your visit in such a way that you do the zoo in the morning, then do the river cruise and finish off with night safari as they are all located at a stone's throw fro each other. Also going back again to see one attraction will become cumbersome and expensive taxi fare. There are unique combo tickets that combine all four parks - Jurong, zoo, night safari and river cruise.
Suggested itinerary
11am to 3pm : zoo
3 to 5pm : river cruise
5 to 6pm dinner at one of the many restaurants at the entrance of the safari
6:15pm onwards queue
7:15 fire show at the entry"
,,Very good experience,5.0,,"The show held in the evening and the train ride is a very good experience for everyone to see the animals in their natural habitat. Despite being a dense tropical area, it was well maintained and 'almost' devoid of mosquitos"
,,Astonishing A life-First Night Tram ride......,5.0,,"A very good experience and must cover spot of singapore,as visit is incomplete without these tram ride.I suggest to go there on weekday as crowd is less as compared to weekends.You must report and stand in queue @ least 40 minutes prior as queue goes nearly crazy.One can experience THUMBAKAR SHOW here."
,,What did I do wrong?!,3.0,,"It may be unfair for me to give a mediocre review against nature, but I've seriously been to Night Safari 3 times in the last 4 years and I hardly ever seen any animals on the tour. They are either too far back in the enclosure or are just sleeping. I can't blame the park itself, but I don't feel that the park offers enough outside of the main tram tour to make it worth going there. The pre show is mildly entertaining but pretty standard fare for an animal park. If you're in Singapore visiting for longer than 3 or 4 days go ahead and check it out, but don't put it at the top of your must-do list."
,,wooooooooo,5.0,,"A great experience. Must visit. After the tram ride, one must walk inside the zoo also to feel its beauty"
,,Disappointed and not worth the wait to go in time,3.0,,"Long queues at the wait and we need to wait for the admission time before we can enter the night safari and there is on the weekday night. The fire show we hardly able to see clearly due to too crowded and the other show is average only, when I come out after the show, the feeling its like ""just like that!"", nothing special. Almost fall asleep during the tram ride as hardly able to see anything and there is nothing special, some are the same animals we saw during the day zoo. Not worth the money and time, not recommended."
,,Singapore night safari,4.0,,This is a good experience. Very smartly the regular day zoo is converted into a night safari. The added show by tamed animals to promote environment issues is good. One could choose a walk or travel by the train. The stops in between also adds value. Do not expect anything on the lines of African safari or even those available in India.
,,Poor crowd management on a Saturday night,2.0,,"The system seemed rather disorganised as there were very long queues with some people trying to cut queues at the ticketing counters and the waiting area before entering the park. The staff did not seem to care much as they continued to serve someone who had cut our queue instead of highlighting to her to join the queue at the back.

The animal show was a disappointment and it paled in comparison to that of the Zoo. While the trainer was very enthusiastic in sharing her knowledge about the animals, the duration of the show could have been longer (instead of just 15 mins) and more animals could be introduced as well.

I did not try the food there, but I find the prices too expensive for the dishes and ambience (non-air conditioned food court). For instance, a chicken rice set is priced at $18.

It is better to save your $ or/and time and visit the other attractions next to it (Singapore Zoo and River Safari) instead."
,,Long wait,3.0,,Once the safari started was good but the wait arrived at 6.30 for 7.15 trip to discover it was sold out had to wait till 8.15 for next safari. There was little to do gift shops and eating areas okay but so busy and crowded. Fire eaters show impossible to see for crowds. Once allowed in wait for safari buses another hour in extremely hot humid snaking queue. No time after safari for anything else as our bus let by 10.15.
,,A let down!,1.0,,"To our utter dismay the safari turned out to be a major let down with hardly any animals to view!
The usual varied types of deers, a couple of zebras, one giraffe, hippo, two elephants , rhino, one tiger, one asiatic and one African lion couple the other few animals failed to attract even a few eyeballs!
With a policy that prohibits using flash, even the best of cameras fail to focus and capture the moment.
How does one carry back memories of this visit?
An over hyped attraction! For those who have done safaris elsewhere, specially Bangkok and South / Africa, this one is highly avoidable.
Except for the cool weather, there is nothing much that could be boasted about this safari!"
,,So much better than the River Safari.,4.0,,"Certainly different and nice to go somewhere where it's a little cooler in the evening. Excellent public transport links take you straight to the zoo and the night safari which is next door. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops to use either before or after your trip on the land train. Fire eating display to start followed by animal show but the big attraction is the trip on the land train taking you through different areas and past different animals. We went to the River Safari the following day but were somewhat disappointed."
,,Very good family activity,4.0,,We did the night safari with our 13 & 9 year-old boys. It was a very nice and unique experience. I would recommend leaving enough time so that you can also walk on some of the paths and not only ride the tram.
,,night safari,2.0,,Don't worth the money. Only common animals which every one would have seen shown under sport light. I don't think it is worth money
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,I and my cousin went yesterday.It was a nice experience that we can see animals in night view and the shows held in night safari was amazing And also the tram experience is good
,,Long lines spoil the experience,3.0,,"Having visited the Singapore Zoo previously, I was expecting a lovely evening with my family. Instead, I experienced horribly long lines and non-existent crowd control. Standing in line for a tram with hundreds of people for over an hour with tired children was not what I had in mind. My youngest fell asleep by the time we finally got on the tram. It was inexcusable for the zoo to pack so many people in there without having the capability to service them. I would say to avoid Saturday nights and get a VIP package with one of the resorts."
,,What a boring experience!,1.0,,"It was a very boring experience and you don't really have much to see. It is not worth it to spend hours to get there and wait for an hour to get on the tram which it will drive us by those ordinary animals for a 45 minutes trip. The food and drinks are very expensive like a bottle of 390ml coke is selling for $4.50 and for the food the chilli crab at the called Chinese Wok is selling for $69.00. The fireplay was ok but it was a free show while you wait on the line to the entrance so anyone could sit there and watch it.
So I rate Night Safari a negative point. And I really don't think it should be running any longer if no one wants to come back again."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"Enjoy a open car train ride through an area separate to the main Zoo - amazing to see the animals so close. The animals are spotlit and it's very atmospheric. Despite repeatedly being told, a few idiots still used their mobile phones + flash, at one point the guide stopped the train to tell a guy to put his phone away. Shame it wasn't given away to a zebra. Don't use your phones! Enjoy time just sitting and looking, it's marvellous!"
,,Night Outings,5.0,,"A little bit far in Mandai area but worth the journey there for a night out with wild animals.
The settings and layout for these rare wild animals are well orchestrated with good sound and lighting effects.
There is mono rail system to transport visitors around the park. Intermittently there are cafes and drinks shops at the park with the main one at the entrance.
The souvenir shop carry many nice collective items and apparels suits for young and elderly.
Enjoy tbe special intelligent talented animal show at tbe end if tbe tour."
,,Simply majestic,5.0,,This is a must do! Leaving singapore without doing this will be criminal. The whole evening is amazing starting from the show to the actual night safari is beyond your imagination
,,Disappointing !,2.0,,"My wife and I went on the night safari with our son,daughter- in -law and two grandsons, aged 3 years, and 9 months. The fire eaters were excellent whilst we were waiting for the 7.15 admission.However, there were so many people queueing to get on the trams that we had to wait for almost an hour to get on, by which time both children were asleep. I think that far too many tickets had been sold. Tip : avoid Saturdays !
We also thought that the prices for food and drink were extortionate, even by Singapore standards."
,,Get up and close to the animals,3.0,,Fun experience and the cars are open and you get to come up and close to many of the animals without bars or glass between you. Fun and a different way of going to a zoo.
,,Great effort,5.0,,"Great effort by the zoo keepers to make as natural as possible the habitat for endangered species. Food prices are a bit on the high side, so better take a bus to the nearest hawker area (bus stop/terminal is just a few meters away from the exit)."
,,Animals of the Dark,3.0,,"It was raining when we visited the Night Safari, luckily they did not close the Park, and arranged Tram ride which took us all around the Park."
,,Too crowded and longest wait for the tram rides,2.0,,"Just cam back disappointed with the group of children. They were all excited and looking forward...but upon arrival at 7.30pm, the queue was very long.

Night safari should have catered for the number of visitors having collected the entrance fees. But waiting for the tram rides took almost an hour. It was unpleasant and hot and humid and the kids lost all their interest.

The frequency of the trams should be made to cater to the crowd.
To the Management, please consider the alternative to increase the number of trams so that the average waiting time does not need to be an hour.

Overall an unpleasant stay and we left."
,,An impromptu visit to the night zoo,4.0,,"As per my nephew, ""much better than the Singapore Zoo"", as we were able to see animals/insects that would only be out during the night."
,,An absolute treat!,4.0,,The only bad thing was the tour I had gone with on this. I had gone with Viator tour for express shuttle. While it was good for the express shuttle it was by far a waste of money as you only got 30 minutes free time and missed out on one of the shows. I would recommend doing your own thing and getting your own way there so you have plenty of time to see and enjoy everything! Or if you want to do the tour get your own way home. Note it is far out of the city so a cab can cost $60. or you can purchase a hop on hop off bus ticket and they do it as well. Or they have public transport (not sure what time that finishes though). just know IF YOU GO WITH THE VIATOR TOUR YOU WILL MISS A LOT OF THINGS! The dinner package was okay. The tram was excellent and great to see all the animals. The walking trails were fantastic although you do get lost if you don't pay attention. You can not use flash photography here but can take photos so be aware. The night safari is beside the river safari and the zoo. I would recommend spending the whole day and doing each one. Also if you chose to do it on a sunday you will find it hard to get a taxi/cab as they have their family day so they don't usually work out that way. So be prepared for a long wait or get a bus. Highly recommend!
,,Worth the queues,4.0,,"We took our 5 & 6 year old to the Night Safari (715pm admission) in June. We bought our tickets as part of the 4-park ticketing, so felt it was well priced. The queue to enter at 715 was HUGE so we hung back until it had died down and entered. We skipped the queue to the trams and went on the walking trails which were fantastic. Plenty of animals to see and very close up. The kids were a little wary of the dark but soon relaxed. We eventually headed to the trams about 830 and even though there was still a queue, it was fast moving and worth getting on eventually. The animals were all very active and alert. I would recommend it as it is completely different to the day zoo and well run. We didn't do any of the shows, so can't comment on those. Taxis were easy to find when we left and no queue. Bring insect repellent and water and don't bother too much with the camera - just enjoy the experience!"
,,Overrated,2.0,,Just too many people going through. Some groups are very annoying as rude and pushy so does not make for a comfortable experience
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,Nicely arranged tour of variety of animals @ nite in near natural surroundings. Well maintained and secured for visitors. Ideal for walkers to take different walk trails but tram journey too exciting. Fire People show at the beginning was mind blowing while creatures of the night show could have been more exciting. Must see even if you see the zoo
,,Enjoyed It,5.0,,"A wonderful experience. We started with walking trail, while waiting for our ride around the safari.It's quite dark well that's what's the tour is about, to observe these animals by the night. It's been scary, the cars that will take you around is an open one which is scary especially when you have kids because these animals are in their natural habitat they are not in the cages."
,,Enjoyed it,4.0,,"We first went for a river safari tour, we have to wait till the rain stops, they are more cautious about the thunder and lightning. And when the rain stopped we went ahead with the tour. During the river tour we saw some animals along side the river. At night, we joined the night safari tour. It was packed and very busy. At first we had a walking tour and then we took the carriage an open one which is quite scary because you'll see the animals in their natural habitat, not in they cage,even the tigers.But the animals are well behave maybe because it's night time."
,,Nothing else like it,5.0,,"I love zoos and this has to be my favourite. You see animals you don't normally see and see them active, not hiding from the midday heat. The animals seem happy and looked after by passionate and friendly staff. Certainly recommend"
,,Not impressed,3.0,,OMG! The crowds. It was so packed and then after a long wait in the queues you get to gonon the tram. Saw a few animals. For me personally this was not an impressive tourism stop.
,,Not great,3.0,,"Singapore really pushes that this is a great place to go to. However, I felt like the day zoo was much better and had much more to see and do."
,,Great place,5.0,,I took my kid to this place and we can see another word in the night. If you come with kid please do not missed this place in to your itinerary too
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Watching the animals in the night is a good experience especially for kids. Very safe and quite a lot of animals to see. Dont miss the feeding schedule, especially the otters. There are two shows in the evening before the safari starts. Be there 30 mins before, and yes u can combine both the night safari and the zoo activity in one day."
,,Night life in a zoo!,3.0,,We took our teenage Grandsons who thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We were not so enthusiastic...went round on the night train but walking around in the dark not so exciting for older visitors. A different experience but we much preferred the zoo in the daytime.
,,Don't Avoid The Walking Trails Just Because It's Hot!,4.0,,"This was a wonderful experience - really enjoyed the tram tour around the park, was impressed with how many of the animals were out that late at night (but I guess they wouldn't call it a ""night safari"" for nothing...)
Make sure that you do the walking trails too as you'll see animals that you wouldn't see otherwise (who knew bats were that cute, that close up?) and you'll get closer to some of the animals you saw from the tram.
The show was good but nothing special.
Didn't eat any food there as I wasn't excited by what was on offer and it was rather pricey."
,,Encounter with the animals at Night..Excitement unlimited !,4.0,,"We visited Night Safari on 24th May. As we reached late, the creatures of night show had already started , so decided to take walking trail. I must the walking trail are must do at Night Safari. You get to see the animals like wallaby, hyena, bison, etc so closely, actually can get you goosebumps. The tram ride takes you through different regions of night safari and describes the animals seen. Really an experience in itself. Although i had heard many people say that all asian animals so there is nothin exciting, But i choose to differ. You get to see the animals live openly at night in their own privacy and the tram too is open, so thts the fun. The shows were ok, nothing great as such. But overall i would say an evening well spent !"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,The Singapore Night Safari is an extension of the Singapore Zoo. Even though you have see the Zoo the Night Safari is totally different. It is so much better now as the Zoo / Night Safari / Jurong Bird Park and the River Safari are now all grouped together so You could conceivably spend a whole day and part of the night all in one location. I cannot supply photos for the Night Safari as they are Totaly Forbidden as it damages the animals retinas
,,Night Visit,3.0,,"First time at a Zoo during the night, different experience. The tram experience was good. Was difficult to take photos during the night."
,,Night out with animals,4.0,,It was nice to look at different animals of different regions at one place. Hope it could have been much more enjoyable if we had taken to walking trails which we could not do for paucity of time
,,Unique. ..natural,5.0,,"Night safari is something to go for to see animals in their natural habitat and surrounding. You can either follow the trails and walk or take a tram ride. I preferred a tram ride as I had young kids. They would enjoy the ride better. Safari starts from 7.15 onwards and there are different timings till 11.15.
Food outlets are just in front of the safari place. Drinks are also not a problem.
You can spot all animals from bears, elephants, lion, Tiger, rhinos, deers and so on. You can see them so close. Only the tiger had a glass covering. The elephants are beautiful. There's an elephant named sameera which is 15 years old and she was born in the Singapore zoo. Her father is also there and you can see during safari. He has beautiful long tusks and was dancing while we were on tour that night.

Huge rhinos...

Different types of deers all so close and sometimes there were even blocking the tram.
Taking pictures Could be difficult as it's dark and you can't use flash."
,,Crowded and overrated,3.0,,"The night safari ride itself is a novel idea and good as long as your there only for a new experience. A few animals here and guess if you club it with the zoo visit in the day.. Can become an overkill.

There are long queues throughout and can get very hard with young kids who are impatient as Singapore is quite hot as well.."
,,You can feel the crisp night air .,4.0,,The experience is impressive. However on a saturday the queue is so long and you have to wait at about 7p.m.before the park opens. I think the staff should learn a bit more on crowd control .
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Middle of nowhere, not easy to get to but worth it! Loved seeing the animals at night. Bring own snacks and drinks as SO expensive there!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Amazing experience of seeing wildlife of the night, through close quarters. Don't miss the show, great attraction for kids"
,,Great Night but go after 9pm,5.0,,"I went to the Night Safari with 2 friends recently, we caught a cheap taxi from Orchard Parade. When we arrived it was very busy and a lot of kids running around, we thought it was a bit to much but just after we entered most of the crowds emptied out and it felt like we had the place to our selves. We got on the train with only 5 other people. I strongly suggesting going after 9 if you don't want crowds. I also only suggest going to the animal show if you have kids. It wasn't great and more aimed towards the kids. The rest of the park was spectacular tho. The animals are a lot more active at night. Being a humid Asian country the night time event is cooler and very relaxing."
,,very nice evening,4.0,,"a nice evening surrounded but beautiful greens and of course the wild animals. the ride stops often allowing you to catch a good moment of the animals interaction. a little too dark at times, difficult to take perfect photos but the full experience is worth it."
,,nice evening,4.0,,"we had a pleasant evening, the ride to visit the zoo is cleverly done as it stops along the way to catch the wild animals. a little dark at times , difficult to take photos, but the experience of night safari is worth it."
,,Make sure you go with a tour,3.0,,Booked our visit through a tour group and was able to avoid the long and crowded queues to ride the tram. Would not recommend the option for the buffet dinner as it was marginal food. There are several food stalls that serve better food and value.
,,Birth of an elephant,5.0,,"When we first arrived we went to the show which was a biyt contrived and cheesy, but trying tio get a message across I guess. Then we headed to the tram (sit at the back during the show to get the advantage when heading for the tram :-) ). As we drove round we could hear the elehants making all sorts of noises. We saw 3 elephants together and they were trumpeting and making noises a bit like a whining child. As we drove further on, we could see a ranger moving towards the elephant enclosure so realised something was up. We left the tram and walked around the walking trails for a couple of hours. Before we left we decided to do the tram one more time to see if we could see some of the animals we had missed earlier. This time there were only two elephants, and they were quiet. The ranger explained that there were normally 3 elephants on the night safari but one had goven birth an hour or so before, we were stoked!!! It explained the noise that they had been making.
Clearly not going to happen for everyone, but in all honesty it is still well worth a visit, we heard the lions roaring, very eerie at night, and the leopard was asleep against the glass so we could virtually touch him. We had done the zoo earlier in the week which was fantastic, but this was so much more peaceful somehow. Worth buying a combined ticket with the zoo, and possibly the 4 park ticket"
,,Wildlife Experience,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, plan to go to Night Safari. Best time to go will be around 7:30-8:30pm. Although the queue may be overwhelming at first, its very fast moving as there are trams that come almost every 10 mins. Each tram takes about 30-35 pax at a time. If you want to explore further, may sure you get off the tram on its first stop as you will be going through the trail by foot. For those who prefer to just stay on the tram, the experience is great too. You get to see different exotic animals in action and really close. The experience is amazing.. kids will love it. Please make sure you dont take flash photography as compliance to the park's rules and courtesy to other guests. Truly, this wildlife experience is worth coming back for. It makes u appreciate not just the wildlife but nature in its whole entirity!"
,,Nice Show...,4.0,,The show before the entrance is so nice... The flames show... Lot of people and a very long que that you will wait for ages untill going inside the Tram.. The Singapore Zoo is much better.. The night safari has animal show inside.. But it's really so simple and only 3 kinds of animals they show... Not as expected!!
,,Thriller,5.0,,I have been with the family.Its a unique experience of watching untamed wild animals in the open while moving in an open tram...a real thriller.Safari at night is a great experience that one must never miss when in singapore
,,Watch out for the Bats!,5.0,,One of the highlights of the trip. Very well organised and great fun. The walk through the bat enclosure was interesting! Dive bombed by bats the size of dogs that brush against you in the dark was definitely unique!
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"The night safari consists of a performance, then a show by animals and then a tram safari. People can ofcourse walk around the park guided with park authorities and enjoy the beauty of the park at night. The animals are so wonderful and are available in the open to view for all. It seems as if they are all waiting for us to arrive. 3hours spent here are the best you can spend and worth it. Excellent place."
,,"Exciting, a bit nerve-wrecking to say the truth",5.0,,"Night Safari is very exciting and special compared to other zoos I've been to! For one, the animals aren't locked in the cages. For the more tamed ones, you can even be very close with them and see them cross the road in front of you. The tram ride was excellent and you really get to see the animals. However for the trails, I find it a bit nerve-wrecking in the dark. It could just be me being wimpy, depending on the time and the trail you're at, the experience could be wonderful with the silence and darkness, making star gazing possible. Seeing the line for the tram as we enter at 8:30pm, we talked to the staff and was advised to first walk the Wallaby trail, then watch the Creatures of the night show before catching the tram, and after the tram do the rest of the trail. Entering at 8:30pm gave us enough time to do everything before the park closes."
,,Great evening with the team,5.0,,First time had a night safari with the team. We were able to see the animals who normally fell asleep during the day. It was a memorable night
,,Creepy but thrilling...,4.0,,"One thing on my list of travel was a trip to the Night Safari. Once you reach the nearby metro station ask the inquiry about the bus stand for the zoo. The zoo bus service is very easy and good for pocket. The zoo was crowded but very much managed.
The night Safari starts with a open air show with animals and followed by a tram ride through the jungle. Both the show and ride was exciting. My main attraction was the night tram ride. The tram will take you within the jungle. You can hop-on or hop-off at different stations and explore the areas with or without a guide.
Overall it was a thrilling experience. Better to take you kids who will love the place."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"This is the first time I have been to the Night Safari. I came because I managed to get a corporate pass for the evening. I'm glad I did not have to pay for the tickets as it would have been a total waste of money. It was a Friday evening and my family arrived at 7 pm. It was super crowded with very long queues. We managed to skip the queues because of the members pass but can imagine how awful it would have been if we had to go through those queues. The Creatures of the Night show was an embarrassment. After all the elaborate instructions nothing of interest other than the cute otter appeared. It ended abruptly and you can feel the ""huh that's it?!"" feeling in the audience. We tried the wallaby trail and tiger trail and managed to see two wallabies and a sleeping tiger. Oh yes a lots of sleeping pigs or babirusa as they call them. Thankfully we got up the tram halfway and that was quite an alright ride where we could see animals quite close. However they were mostly deer. The tapirs were quite interesting. The children enjoyed the tram ride. Overall I won't recommend this place. Stick with the zoo and river safari."
,,Awesome experience so says my kid,5.0,,My children absolutely love the experience that is after you get pass the long queue. Aside from that everything else is wonderful and a great place to keep in mind if you ever in Singapore.
,,Presentation was excellent,3.0,,"Hi, you won't anything special from other zoo or if you've visited Singapore zoo in the morning. Why this is different from other place is because of show and the way it was presented it differs with respect to other"
,,Buy tickets in advance avoid the rush,5.0,,Try to buy tickets in advance to avoid any rush or lines at the location. Food is super expensive at the restaurants there. Attraction is superb and very well maintained.
,,Not Very attractive,3.0,,The concept is good but the content is average. Overall not enjoyed.. The animals which was kept can be seen any of the average Zoo also.
,,Good one time experience,4.0,,"It's a night safari so it's not just about seeing the animals but also experiencing the dark, sounds, noises etc. Good for kids but as long as they don't get scared or feel sleepy."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"This is a well organised tour, it's nice that it is held during the evening so it's not as hot. Would recommend this attraction, for couples or a family."
,,Interesting,5.0,,This was an interesting experience and worth doing once. Lots of animal's to see as you go along in a train around the park.
,,Average and Crowded,3.0,,The overall experience is not that great. It is humid and crowded! The Creatures of the night show is not that amazing too. The tram ride however is kinda cool especially when see you those animals with nature.
,,Extremely crowded,1.0,,"While the concept is good, but the place is being very poorly managed. We were in the queue for almost 2 hours before getting an opportunity to ride the safari... all this after paying through our nose."
,,"Over-rated, very disappointing",2.0,,"I would not recommend the Night Safari to anyone. We telephoned in the morning to make enquiries and were told it wasn't necessary to book ahead. We arrived at 6.45 only to find that the 7.15 session was sold out. We booked for 8.15 and filled out time with the Fire Show, the Creatures of the Night and mainly queueing. The Fire Show was mildly entertaining for the 10 minutes that it runs. The Creatures of the Night was pitched at small children, very ""staged"" and with patter that would only have amused a toddler. We then spent a ridiculous amount of time queueing for the tram ride. If it wasn't for the very high cost of admission ($90 for 2 of us plus transport to get there), we would have left the queue and gone back to our hotel. I wish I could say it was worth the wait....but it wasn't. Again the commentary was infantile and the tone and content appeared to be aimed at children. One certainly doesn't feel as if one is seeing animals in the wild. It was a relief when the ride ended."
,,Great,5.0,,Night safari great although I hadn't realised it was just walking around the zoo in the dark thought there was a separate area or park that we hadn't seen. Did the whole day and all three areas so by night the kids 5&7 were a bit tired. Animals more awake a night as cooler but so are the insects so definitely need bug spray x
,,Nothing spectacular,3.0,,"As against the popular reviews of the place, I dint find it too exciting.. it's an ok kinda place, kids can enjoy spotting animals and audio assisted tram ride can be fun but nothing spectacular. If you have been to any zoo in India, you are sure to have a similar experience, only difference is that you enjoy the ride in evening. This place can be definitely skipped if you are not a big nature fan. Fire show at the end is good and worth a credit."
,,"Good for a one time, but wouldn't recommend a repeat visit",3.0,,"A couple of years ago, Night Safari was less crowded and less expensive. Apparently its getting popular with the masses. The 7:15 time is extremely crowded and takes about 30 mins to just enter the park. Inside, there's nothing exceptional. The team ride is about 40 minutes and more or less covers the whole area. I have done all of the walking trails too and they're pretty much the same but I would recommend wallaby trail if you want to do just one.
The creature of the night show used to be longer before, but they have cut it short. Also, its exactly the same jokes as it was 3 years ago. I think they need to keep innovating to keep it interesting for repeat audiences. The only thing I like watching over and over is the fire dance performance outside Bongos. It just doesn't get boring :)

Tips that might help:
1) You will get a 10% discount if you book night safari online, 30% discount if you book 2 or more park tickets and 50% discount if you book all 4 - zoo, night safari, river safari and river cruise.
2) If you prefer the 7:15 slot, book at least a day in advance. Specially if your planned date is on a Friday or Saturday.
3) The food around that area is unreasonable over-priced and bad. Eat before you come or you will shell out a lot of money only to be disappointed.
4) Check the weather forecast to see if its going to rain. They cancel the shows when it does, and the ticket is non-refundable.
5) If you want to take pictures, take a camera that can take photos without flash. In most of the places, flash photography is not allowed as it disturbs the animals."
,,One of the best Zoos in the world.,5.0,,At no other zoo have my children been so excited throughout the experience....the fire show....the night safari...the tram ride...and to top it all the zoo authorities were so alert on having safely gaurded my child when she was lost ....true
,,pricey and skippable,3.0,,"The zoo is a must do but this safari can be skipped. Its expensive and will keep you there for a long time. You will end up spending a lot of money on the night safari, the mediocre food and expensive cabs. So, its easier to plan to skip it altogether."
,,"We went on a night tour, it is nice especially with the mini bus tour",4.0,,"I have been to different Zoos in different continents, so I can't say this is the most attractive one, but it has nice attractions and driving through the zoo with an electrical mini bus is a nice experience."
,,So Fun!,4.0,,"This was really good, coming from Africa and having been on Safari there. I did this half heartedly but It was actually really good. The walking trails were laid out very well and there are a lot of animals. The show that is on however I feel is a little too short and there is not plenty of animals that are brought out during the show. I also loved the tram ride around the park and you get to see lots of animals even the ankole(long horned cows) that are from my country. Recommended for all ages! SO fun"
,,Night Safari,2.0,,We did the night safari at the zoo and were very disappointed with it. You couldn't see much at all. I've been to the San Diego Wild Animal Park and their night safari ranks far better.
,,Great night out with kids,4.0,,Show is great as is the tour. Fire show also worth seeing. Can get very crowded but worth the trip. Several venues for dinner which you can have prior to gates opening.
,,Unique,5.0,,When it gets dark at 7pm each evening there's one place which you simply must visit at least once and that is the night safari at Singapore zoo. Walking around at night seeing the nocturnal animals running around is a wonderful sight and one which i will rememver for a very long time
,,Amazing and worth the crowds,5.0,,"We followed advice on tripadvisor and got there early. We took a combo of mrt and taxi to night safari on a week night. We
also chose the 7:15 admission- and arrived by 7 so we could see the flame blowing show at the gates. Our kids were mesmerized by this.
We went for the tram right away thinking if we did not see a huge line we would wait- given we were the first admission group.
We were half way in the first set of waiting lines and so this was about a 20-25 min wait. They have many trams! Not bad and it got dark. What a great ride. It is crazy how close the animals are!!! (Kind of unsettling!) but amazing. Creatures of the night was just ok- short, but kids loved it. Highly recommend!!!"
,,Overrated,3.0,,"We were really looking forward to this experience. But were quite disappointed. It was very crowded and could be a little more organised especially during entry process. As we wait with the crowd for the doors to open, the staff yelled and asked everyone to move forward and fill in the gaps. It was already tight enough and having a small child with you, makes it a little bit more uncomfortable. We thought the staff doesn't know how it feels like to be in the middle of a big crowd with many children and some elderly around. Its not safe to squeeze in whilst waiting.

We took a map at the entrance but found it useless. We didn't realise the tour is already planned. Each batch will queue, ushered to the night show, then rush back to a station to queue for trams. You can't help but rush because of the crowd. The host of the night show was very entertaining.

The tram ride was okay. The animals were present but 1 or 2 in each stop, except for the deers, otters, flamingos, cows and buffalos. I advise to bring mosquito repellant, fans and water for a more comfortable stay.

The experience could be better with more organisation of people."
,,Best experience of my Singapore trip,5.0,,"I visited the Singapore flyer, Marina Bay Sands, Jurong Bird Park, Universal Studios and Siloso beach apart from this during my stay there. Undoubtedly this Night Safari is the best experience of the lot. It is a whole new concept of a zoo to see the animals in the night effect and the four walking trails give you the feeling of exploring a rainforest in the dark. There are two attractive shows too. However we could not see them as it rained on our day.

The animals are not caged and they are allowed to roam freely in restricted areas and there are tram rides with a guide's voice to narrate about the zoo. Go in the tram once and then explore the trails by foot too. There is a splendid lake view near the first stop of the tram. The view of the moon at this spot is tranquil and serene.

If you go by taxi or bus, you can also see the eco bridge en route where animals are given a bridge to cross the road. That is also a wonderful idea to prevent animals getting hit by vehicles on the road."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,Start the adventures with the wild animals and feel the natures of them. Amazing little world for these creatures. Walking tour may be the best.
,,a new concept,5.0,,"its a different experience as its not available in any other country , animals collection is good and visuality is well planned ,it a well coordinated tour with good inputs"
,,A bit of a disappointment,2.0,,"The concept in theory of having a night safari is good, but in practice, a bit impractical. It was a different experience, that's for sure, but not necessarily a good one. I had no expectations of this whatsoever, so I was pretty open to whatever.

However, there were too many people (I guess it was a Sunday but what do you expect when you're only open a certain time of the day?). The tram's narrator did a good job of educating people about conservation and things like that, but the whole thing felt rushed, and if you're lucky, you'll actually see the animals moving. Most of them were just lying around and sleeping (or just resting). They were too far for you to get a good look, and you couldn't spend your time just looking, as you're in a moving vehicle.

Also, if it starts to rain, the show gets cancelled, which it did on our case, as our tour guide suggested we go to the 8:30PM showing since he noticed the lightning, and advised us to catch it in case it got cancelled. So, it did end up getting cancelled, with an ambiguous announcement that there might be a 9:30PM show if it stopped raining. If. Considering hours open, we couldn't help feel a little shortchanged. There were no contingency plans for weather conditions at all. We were supposed to go on the walking trek, but opted not to, as it started drizzling, and we didn't want to end up sick the next day.

Good intent, but a bad business model. Don't get me wrong, the staff was helpful and nice, but the impracticality of the whole situation was not worth it. Just go to a zoo where you can see the animals properly, and you don't need to crane your neck or squint your eyes trying to see in the dark (you're not nocturnal enough for that)."
,,Seriously worth a visit,5.0,,"I lived in Singapore for 3 years and finally went to the nigh safari in my last year thinking it would be totally overrated. It was actually amazing!!! Like most attractions in Singapore, totally detail oriented and like nothing I'd seen before. The animals were sooo close and there were so many of them it really was like a safari. The commentary was really helpful as well. I just hope that the animals weren't sedated in any way as it was truly incredible how close we were able to get to some of them...
Also good to know that there are bars and restaurants inside so u don't have to go to the limited food court outside!"
,,Night Zoo,5.0,,Amazing trip at night. We did this one some years ago and we were entertained with a traditional South East Asian music and dancing and visited (saw) night creatures like bats.
,,Much hype but...,3.0,,"I had heard a lot of hype on the night safari, but let me put it bluntly it's not up o the mark.. The animal show is a disappointment. The fire show was great. Only 1 tiger and a couple of lions. The food courts are expensive, options are limited. However good effort, a little bit more effort and variety of animals will make the place awesome"
,,Bit rushed,3.0,,It's different and worth doing but there are some drawbacks. We went on an organised tour which meant we got there at opening time which is manic with long queues. We avoided these but had a very rushed Buffett dinner before the tram tour. The majority of animals are cattle or deer. Not good for taking photos as flash is not allowed. The animal show is very juvenille
,,"Bad Bad Experience, soured our entire day. Please avoid and go to the Singapore Zoo",2.0,,"We visited Singapore on our own and took an Attraction Hopper to the River Cruise, Zoo and Jurong Bird Park. After touring the zoo we visited the Night Safari in the evening. But, only to be pushed and shoved in a queue. It was hot and the staff was not cooperative. To make it more hotter, there was a fire show that made my daughter cry. It was aweful as we were made to stand in lines for over an hour. We booked the 7.15 or 7.30 show. Later once we entered we were pushed into even more lines and queues. We were about to leave from this ordeal when we realised we were next to board the tram. There were tram delays and the staff was not cooperative.
Once in the tram, we saw animals but the tram was going too fast to notice them clearly. Especially the white lion which was the symbol of Singapore. The tram was moving very fast then. There were leopard trails and creatures of the night show, but we were exhausted from the shoving and the pushing that we avoided it.
If I wanted shoving and pushing and irritant staff, I would have stuck to Mumbai locals not an expensive trip all the way to Singapore."
,,Great for kids!,5.0,,A zoo visit during night time is a very different experience. We did enjoy it a lot. The downside was the queing. When we arrive there was a very long queue to the first tour trains. I´d suggest to come a little earlier - 30 min before the park opens should do
,,Different and good,4.0,,This is different to most at night. Entertainment at main area and a show. Highlight is the train ride (on the road) through the park with stops and chances to walk. Bit of a gimmick but good all the same. Gets packed which is an issue and food outlets not the best and expensive
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I had a great experience the last time I went there it was definitely a blast because all we had to do was sit in a tram and let it take you around Night Safari and you will be able to see all the animals from up close and far ahead like the lions,tigers etc and some of them like the crocodile you will be able to see up close and it looks good just don't sleep in the tram or you will loose the opportunity of the whole tram experience and lastly catch the shows which are interesting and hilarious with cute animals doing different things"
,,Overrated attraction,3.0,,"Our experience to the Night Safari was tainted with our awful experience with the SAEx shuttle. I prepaid online for six persons, waited for 30 minutes from a designated pick up point, only to call the company and be told that the 6:00pm, 6:15pm and 6:30pm buses were full and that we had to catch a taxi. Lucky I expressed my displeasure at their lack of service and I got a refund of $60SD for two taxis. The trip home was the same experience. There was no 10:00pm, 10:15pm or 10:30pm shuttle as advertised on their website. We ended up paying $60SD on the return trip, not refunded the SAEx. By 11:00pm with two young children and two seniors we were too tired and hot to argue with the company. Please note, the SAEx service is recommended by Night Safari on their website. DO NOT USE SAEx for any travel around Singapore.

As for the park. It was difficult to redeem my Singapore City Pass, and I was shuffled around to different lines only to be serviced 30 minutes by the first attendant I approached. The fire show was slightly entertaining. The tram ride around the park was ok but it was driven fairly quickly. There was a lot of pushing and shoving happening at the tram line which my young kids found scary. The show is not worth seeing. More talk than showcasing animals, in actual fact they only bring out 4-5 animals. The bird show at Taronga Zoo, Sydney is significantly better. The merchandise was astronomically priced. Two shirts and two small stuffed animals cost $140SD. We would not come back again. It was a very disheartening experience."
,,Definitely pay to Skip-the-Line,4.0,,"We did the Skip-the-line trip which included hotel transfers, dinner, the tram, the creatures of the night show and the fire show but it was all a bit rushed. I would recommend you do the version without dinner so you have time to see the fire show at the beginning and I would miss the Creature Show to give you time to do one of the walks. The Creature Show was really disappointing - even my 5 year old was bored - too much waiting, not enough action - I've seen these types of shows done so much better elsewhere.

The highlight of the night was though what we went for - the tram ride. No way I would have wanted to wait in line - the crowds were crazy. The ride and commentary was good and we saw heaps - more time at the big African animals would have been good though. I wouldn't get get off the tram though as there were long lines of people waiting to get back on.

We were picked up at 6pm and all the various tours and buses met at China Town - we didn't leave there till 6.55pm which was late and contributed to the rush as it takes 30m to reach the Safari. We met to come back at 10.10pm and thankfully almost everyone was dropped off our bus in one stop or it would have taken an eternity to get back."
,,Tram ride is the best but thats it.,3.0,,"We got here late unfortunately due to bad timing with the MRT and bus service mix up so we missed the flame throw show. There were a lot of people when we went which was a Thursday night at 8.15pm. We thought we would go to the Creatures of the night show first. So many people and hard to find a place to sit. Be very early if you want a good spot. The staff member taking the show was exellent. She knows her job well and is a sure performer. Had a few good laughs. It was a short show and nothing really exciting happens. We then hopped on the tram which is a great ride. We got off during the ride to explore a section of the safari. Unfortunately we did not see any animals at all!! I get they have to sleep and are not in their wild habitat but did not see one in this section. I did enjoy seeing a few animals back along the train ride but some of the narrators story did not seem to coincidenwith what we were seeing i.e. talking about giraffes but seeing zebras. When the ride finished it was getting late and we decided not to see the wallaby trail (we are from Australia is this isn't new to us anyway). We got dinner instead (ran out of 2 meals so had to settle for another at the indian restaurant) and left.
It would be a great place for families with kids and even though we are big kids at heart we weren't overly thrilled with this place. Would be best to get in earlier for dinner and have the chance to watch the flame show beforehand and then we would have been impressed and not so tired and hungry throughout the park."
,,Grwat and Friendly Staffs,5.0,,Great staffs at the entrance! Friendly staffs! Love the lightings and silence of the park at night!!!
,,See the zoo in the morning,3.0,,"This is not the right way to see the zoo, but if you dont like the trails and the treks you should do this. An easy way to see the animals in their habitats. Since you will do the tram rides, try to get an early ride, get down at the stations and walk the trails. You see animals better that way."
,,Great surprize,4.0,,"The Night Safari is connected to the Singapore Zoo, focusing on animals that are active at night time.
It requires a decent trip, and best to take a tour from the city.
The night we went was a public holiday and it was incredibly crowded, but we still managed to have a great time, and would certainly do it again.
One advantage of organizing your own transport is that you are able to spend longer at the park. Busses seemed to all do their final run well before closing."
,,Really loved the Zoo!!,5.0,,"It has a lot of different animals...monkeys, alligators, lions, monkeys (oh did I say monkeys you will see a lot of them), zebras, and it's all in a really natural habitat. Go early or late at night. They are sleeping in the day time."
,,Excellent concept,5.0,,Great concept with a lot of empathy towards nocturnal animals. A good place to visit with friends and family while in Singapore.
,,Wonderful Experience - Not to be missed,5.0,,"Fabulous guided tour of the zoo at night, option available for walking. Would definitely advise a tram guided tour. You can see the animals close and in their natural habitat."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Really interesting and different to visit the zoo at night. Is much better than the daytime trip, good range of animals, get very close to many of the animals, the wallaby trail and bat enclosures are amazing! The tram audio is a bit cheesy and the drinks/food are a bit pricey but overall a great attraction, ensure you have at least 3 hours if you want to do walking trails, tram and the creatures of the night show!"
,,Surprised I liked it so much,4.0,,"We had a 9:00pm reservation for the tram and found this to be an excellent time to visit. Most everyone was headed out the exit gate. Love families with kids but if you want to hear the commentary on the tour going when there are fewer children is probably a good idea. Seeing the animals on the walk was also very nice. Park is well done, but the number of animals seen is limited. Worth the $26 for admission? Not sure how I would answer that. It depends on how many zoos and safari park experiences you have had in the past, I suspect."
,,Very good experience,5.0,,This is a nice way to experience animals in their near natural habitat. There are tram tours with guides.
,,World's 1st Night Safari,4.0,,"Night Safari is located next to River Safari and Singapore Zoo which can be purchased in a package. What caught my attention was the fire breathing display outside the entrance while i was enjoying my CHANG beer and dinner. The 45 minutes tram ride was very well planned as we get to enjoy the close proximity with the animals and managed to see many animals as well. The restaurant was abit too pricey for me as well the beverages on offer. Overall, it was a good trip and i will recommend to my friends."
,,Interesting zoo with close proximity,5.0,,"Most animal are nocturnal, most active at night. Interesting concept to allow close interaction with them. Interesting to see how a giraffe or elephant sleeps. Also like the fire show. Unique experience. Best to visit after the day zoo or river safari."
,,The voyage to a special night,5.0,,This place is the closes you can be to a real night in a tent i middle of the jungle. Let your self to be transport in a closest experience of a wild animal experience without the risk. Get the opportunity and we talk later
,,Interesting Night Safari,4.0,,"Add to the list of must dos in Singapore.

Queues are long even with prior booking.
Enjoyed my trip to Night Safari. Took the tram.
Queues to enter the zoo and queues for the Tram. If you are travelling with children, please factor this when you are visiting the safari.

Or one can time your visit around 8 pm to skip the rush and avoid the queue.

Wonderful sight to see the animals at such close quarters."
,,Second visit,3.0,,"Not as good as the day zoo but still an experience not to be missed. Love the mouse deer - so cute. Lots to see, not enough time to see it in. Don't bother with the show unless taking small kids. Dinner there was the buffet and it was actually very nice. Train trip around the exhibits is great but you just can't cover the four walks at @20mins each and see everything without rushing. If you do visit the zoo and enjoy it try to get to Jurong bird park as well - gorgeous."
,,good one..worth a visit,4.0,,It is worth a visit...as mentioned this is my second visit but loved it again!! the kids loved the animals...the way they take us through the tour is appreciable ... the host of the animal show was energetic person who kept engaged throughout the show and the show is also wells cripted
,,Wow,5.0,,Great time to be there recommendation make purchase of the tickets online before you go there. Enjoy every walking track.
,,Night tour,5.0,,Highly recommended to visit it especially night Safari. Food corner is available bus and taxi stations are just opposite of entrance.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Actually, we did night safari at the zoo and it was a great experience. It was a perfect natural setting that can be setup in a controlled Zoo environment."
,,A very lovely sight to see creatures by the night,4.0,,Well I have been visiting these shows & going on the tram ride for about 15 plus years. It is very nice and Singapore is a destination that keeps you guessing all the time for something new. However this show has changes a lot from what it used to be . Maybe the animals have gone old and then don't respond to them like before. On the whole its is a don't miss site for all the first time visitors.
,,Fantastic group adventure,5.0,,Best bit was the ability to get off the transport tram & have a look around. Excellent value and the open bus to the safari from Suntec city was heaps fun
,,Disappointing,1.0,,Go to the zoo! Can see all these animals there. Not one was nocturnal and could hardly see the point in seeing them in the dark! They all looked as bored as me!
,,Great night out,4.0,,"Really fun way to spend an evening with family or friends.

We went over a public holiday and it was a bit of a wait to get in (even though we'd booked in advance) but it was well worth it! Would highly recommend exploring by foot as well as taking the tram - it's a great chance to get a long and close look at some of the creatures, especially the wallabies which are not enclosed!"
,,Animals of the night,4.0,,"We caught the shuttle from The Village Hotel on Arab Street (they do other hotel pickups) for $10 each way and it took about an hour. We decided to combine the River Safari and Night Safari into one day. We had tickets for the Night Safari to enter at 7:15pm. The queue to get in was just ridiculous, we were all crammed in to a roped off area in preparation for the fire show to start and after that had finished there was a massive rush from everyone to push through the queue until they reached the entry turnstiles, it was manic. When we finally got through we went straight to the Creatures of the Night Show and enjoyed seeing the animals of the night perform for us. After that we decided to do the walking trail and walked around the park before getting on the shuttle after 9:00pm. The park layout is fantastic and we managed to see most of the animals in their enclosures. It takes a while for your eyes to adjust to the dark but after that you should be fine."
,,Great evening out,5.0,,"This Safari is a lot of fun, jump on jump of shuttles so you can watch the animals at night. Don't miss the show it's informative & fun. Suitable for teens as its a different experience."
,,Very special,5.0,,This is my first time visiting this place. I don't know if there are similar zoo elsewhere. Great experience to know more about nocturnal animals!
,,A Fun Experience,4.0,,We did the Night Safari on our first night ...we were picked up at hotel ...no hassle ...very popular..did the Safari and had as much food as you wanted ! Fun Experience enjoyed it
,,Nice activity,5.0,,"Wasn't really expecting much from this, but actually really enjoyed it!
Spotting nocturnal creatures in the dark is good fun.
Everyone gets let in in one big crowd at 7.20. Don't take the tram with everyone else. Go for a walk first and you'll avoid the hordes. We were by ourselves for a lot of the time.
When you're down walking, you can hop on the tram, and by that time it's almost empty."
,,Brilliant evening out,5.0,,We spent several hours taking the tram tour and walking all the interconnecting pathways to view the exhibits at the night zoo. So many animals that are hard to spot during the day and visible on this trip with our only disappointment being the tigers. A great family attraction.
,,"Great for children and young families, not so much for adults with no children",3.0,,"The Night Safari show is really geared towards children and young families which is great, it just does not have much appeal for those of us not traveling with children. Once one enters the park with one’s timed entry ticket, the queue to board the trams was quite long, and there is the obligatory photo stand where you can have your photo taken and the animals are digitally added for a cost. The audio commentary on the trams and the Creatures of the Night Show are entirely geared to children, and I must say that the children present truly enjoyed the trams and the show, and were having a great time.
I would recommend that not riding the trams but rather walking the well-marked trails as you will have a much better chance of seeing the animals. Keep in mind that it is a night time experience, so of necessity, the lighting on the animals is quite low, so if you have poor night vision you will have great difficulty seeing the animals; I have excellent night vision and had difficulty seeing many of the animals myself. Do not bring a camera with you for the Night Safari unless you have a very high end camera with a tripod for taking nighttime photos with no flash as flash photography is not allowed; however, many visitors do use a flash resulting in poor photos and blinding the rest of us on the tours.
Also recommended that water be brought along on the tour as it is quite warm, although there is a snack bar in the middle of the trails where one can purchase drinks and snacks."
,,Night Walk,5.0,,This was wonderful. Having just come from South Africa it was great to see the creatures. The facility is incredibly well made and the tour is interesting. The meal was good.
,,We attended the Night Safari,4.0,,"The zoo is very impressive. We did the night safari to avoid the heat of the day, which was good. The cart does move around a little too fast, but you can walk around tracks as well to take some more time."
,,Nice night attraction,4.0,,"The night safari was fun. Kids under 4 might not appreciate it. Note that nights are still hot, there are mosquitos and if you buy food while waiting, you cannot take it with you (and some of the food is quite expensive - $15 for ice cream).

And you likely will not see all the animals as they do what they want, but the ones you do see are great."
,,Educational,4.0,,"Had a wonderful time with the opening number of THUMBUAKA while on queue at the entrance for the tram ride. Staffs are friendly. Professional. Very educational. Planning to adopt ""chawang"" in the future ☺️"
,,Must See for kids and adults Alike,4.0,,I went in last week of March. It is a bit far from the town centre. You have to catch a bus or a taxi to the place. The buy the tickets online. You get a better deal than taking it at the counter. They have started entry at specific timing each hour. First went to the animal show. The animal show is very good. They show different animals. They let the small kids touch the animals also. The host is funny. Then I went into the tram . It goes into a defined track and a running commentary in English goes on. There are couple of stops to go into the trails. I went for the whole round and then the trail. There are few trails which are a must go. There is a lot of walking involved so do get your sports shoes on. There are bats and flying squirrels. The walking trails are a must see. Ohh forgot. In the entrance there is a fire show which can get cancelled due to winds. Overall a nice place to visit in Singapore with family and friends.
,,Night Safari busy but worth it,4.0,,My mom and I had an amazing evening at the Night Safari. This gave us something else to do other than walk around or go to a bar in the evening. It was incredibly busy and some people were pushy when it came to boarding the tram but overall we had a great time.
,,Something different,5.0,,Good price and something different from the average zoo. Well worth the visit. Went there by taxi and it wasn't expensive.
,,Must Visit attraction,5.0,,"Visited last show here at around 10...we chose local commute metro and bus to explore the city which took us nearly an hr and half to reach the place.We missed the tribal performance , but enjoyed Creatures of the night shoe with fun hosts...then had tram journey which was an experience to roam in jungle around 11-12 at night....amazing to see wild life in open near you....thrilling experience...must do!"
,,Don't go,2.0,,"Interesting but exploitative. If you do go, walk don't ride the tram. You will then see the electric fences which keep the animals in position."
,,The only disappointment in Singapore,2.0,,"Extremely long queues. Takes a long time to get onto the actual safari. It is generally difficult to see clearly in the night time. You can skip this, all the animals you will encounter in night safari can be seen at Singapore Zoo and other wildlife parks at Singapore."
,,What a fun night,4.0,,"We took our 2,5 years son to the night safari, and he loves it. The show was outstanding. The night safari actually so so, they have walking paths in every bus stops (i think they have 6 i forgot) but we didn't walk to see all the animals because our son didn't wanna leave the shuttle bus. They will give you 10% discount if you are traveling with Singapore Airlines."
,,Must do while at Singapore,4.0,,"The night safari is a unique experience !!
Kids are sure to love it especially the Creatures of the Night Show and Tram ride. Walking trails are nice and you may choose which ones to do depending on your interest.
The Tumbakuar show has nothing much to offer except few people blowing fire from their mouths.

Visit time needed: 2.5 hrs
Reach by 6.30 pm
Get something to eat and watch the Tumbakuar Show
Dinner options are available. Limited veg options include

First Entry into park by 7.15 pm
Should be out by 9.15 pm

Best value when seen as part of a combination tkt/ park hopper."
,,Bad customer service,1.0,,"Night safari started an hourly entrance - meaning that you can only enter at either 7.15 or 8.15 etc. We did not know that and bought the tickets without checking the time and our tickets were for 9.15pm. I've called the customer service asking for advice and all the advice I've received was ""to go at 7.30pm to try my luck to enter at 8.15 and not to ""talk so much"" so they are doing me a favor by letting me enter"".

I have always been going to the night safari yearly as my husband and I always bought our guests whom are visiting Singapore there. If this is the kind of service the night safari is aiming for, I have to say I'm deeply disappointed and they will no longer have me as a customer."
,,"Great, if you like long queues and big crowds!",3.0,,"Be prepared to wait in line! Feels like an American themepark. The night safari is cool but again, the queues are horrific!"
,,Must see!!!,5.0,,"It's totally unbelievable how they keep us safe when wild animals like Lions, Tigers & Hyenas are not more than 20 feet away. Totally unique and must do"
,,Very good,5.0,,we have done this on 1st day of our sigapore visit.. Very nice.. It feels very good in night to see animals
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"We went to the Night Zoo on a guided tour. It enabled us priority access to the tram. Next time I would make my own way to the zoo. Do the walks first. We were so lucky as we came to the otters just as they were about to be fed. The keeper allowed our four year old grandson to throw some food to the otters, an absolute highlight for him. We managed to cover all the walks and saw many animals As it was not crowded on the paths. If you take the tram after doing the walks the tram is less crowded and so you are afforded better views of the animals. Be aware if you go to the shows you need to queue for at least half an hour and this was on a quiet night. We chose not to do so. Eat before you go as the food is expensive and is more of the fast food type. We enjoyed our visit especially walking along the paths with very few people in sight."
,,Memorable nocturnal activity,5.0,,The entire concept is so well thought of. It was a first time experience to observe animals in the night and at such close distances. The Creatures of Night show was superb
,,Good idea but needs some work,2.0,,"Went to Singapore for a medical meeting and one of our friends suggested the Night Safari. Completely underwhelming. We were all adults and I guess we expected so much more. We didn't get enough info beforehand and didn't realize it was so canned, (tram on wheels ride on an asphalt road through the middle of a zoo at night). It's too dark to see the animals, which it should be at night (so I felt like we were bothering the animals). You can buy singapore slings in the park and Gelato. It's a lot cooler at night which is a plus. Oh and there is a really cool fire show that the natives...not sure to what...dance with, twirl, eat and spit FIRE, very cool."
,,Nice,4.0,,The night show is fun. Tram riding is great. Night trail was a bit scary but nice. Its good for kid's
,,1st visit to Night Safari and Love it!,5.0,,Surprisingly long queue from 6.30pm despite night safari starts at 7.15p. Many restaurants inside the zoo. Highly price in comparing with day zoo and River safari. Spent at least $25 per person for simple meal. Would recommend people to come early and have this in Singapore zoo before entering. Love it onboard with the tram for 30+ minutes.Seeing many animals walking very close. You have a night show. Must go! $45 for adult ticket. Night safari close at midnight.
,,Not interesting...hard to view animals...,3.0,,"too crowded even on week days as all sightseers from zoo/river safari joins here when that attraction closes.thumbuakar performance - no seating arrangement, viewing is just by platform so be in right spot for better viewing.after thumbuakar performance go directly through gate 4 to creatures of the night show starts at 1930hr and ends at 2000hr. then take the tram for the ride from gate 1.it takes approx 1 hr to complete single ride. u cant use flash photography and as its dark(dim light) hard to see animal thoroughly..mankind is selfish/disobedient and irrespective of guide advice still tourist used flash to take photo of lion."
,,Nices zoo i'v ever been,5.0,,"Love the fact that animals weren't in cages, but had lots of room to roam around, and they were really active as we also happend to see many feedings.
Includes a free tram ride across the zoo.
And not as much kids as during day time which made this a bit quieter visit."
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,"This is one thing you must do in Singapore. This attraction is huge, and the crowds give testimony to this. It is a ""no pics"" attraction, as flash would scare the animals, but in every sense, a true safari adventure. Animals living in harmony!! How did they achieve it."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Very popular with long queues. We went on an organized tour which included a buffet meal and express access. The buffet was plentiful, but bland. . The night safari itself was on trams which move from the various enclosures. Yes it was dark which restricts vison and what you can see also depends on where you are seated, some viewings of the animals were better than others, walking would have been better. Overall pleasant but disappointing."
,,I love this place!,4.0,,"The first thing I will do when I go night Safari is to have my dinner and enjoy the fire show from the crews. Personally feel that animals are acting differently during night time, and the weather is better for sure compared to daytime. Don't miss the place"
,,well worth the visit get there early,5.0,,"It is suggested you get there early and take in the shows prior to boarding the trams to look around the park.

We found walking the trails afforded us better views of the animals than when on the trams.

We had an early dinner before going but they do have a number of eating places at the venue however I do not know what the prices are like."
,,Unique experience with animals,4.0,,"We have visited the Night Safari in March. This is an amazing experience. You should visit it if you like animals. You can have a close look of them. There are two ways to visit the park. You can take the train or walk along the tracks. If you are going with kids, you may need to be careful with the bats. There are some bats flying around. Besides, you can see the tigers, lions, zebra, elephants, etc."
,,Every visit was different,5.0,,"I have been a member of Night Safari. Very often, I have friends visiting me and Night Safari is a must visit for them.

Every time I visit the Night Safari, there was always surprises and it is always different. The animals always behave differently, be it hot weather or after it rains.

Take the tram ride follow by the walk. To really enjoy the Night Safari, cater at least 2 hours, 3 hours would be ideal.

Flying foxes, fruits bats, animals walking openly in the park and many more exciting adventures await you."
,,Pretty close to Nocturnal animals,5.0,,"We visited Night safari on 7th May. It was my second visit after 2011. The disappointment was that nothing much is changed. But I still like the Tram Rides and walking trails. Do take 7:15 pm slot, since it allows you to take tram ride first and then venture out on trails. So you can manage time. Creatures of the Night show is OK, it feels little shorter. Don't miss the Tiger n Lion feeding sessions, it's worth every penny to look at these big cats. Use Night Safari online booking, it usually has few promotions going on. Avoid Rainy days!"

,,one of a kind,4.0,,a must go. i've read about it many times but seeing it for myself was really worth it. my kids enjoyed themselves too.
,,Night safari,4.0,,"This was a great night but must do as tour package with pick up and deliver back to hotel. Hundreds of people there just entering as walk in customers.We had this with dinner could not fault our tour guide walked us to reserved sit down buffet what a spread there was so much choices of food and desert it was excellent. Then lead us to trolley for start of tour of safari. After trolley ride we then could look around ourselves then back to start point out front bus back to either hotel direct or for us and others dropped a number people at location in city then had shuttle buses back to hotel, terrific setup organised by efficent team."
,,Average,3.0,,Tour is well organized but really nothing impressive if you have already done other night safari (ie: chiang mai). If you plan well you can finish the tour in about 2h. You will not be able to feed the animal in Singapore and most of the animal you will see are quite far. We were not be able to spot the hidden giraffe though.
,,Highlight of Singapore's night,5.0,,"The Night Safari is very popular. You can see lots of nocturnal animals in their natural environment. The ever-practical Singaporeans have made an very successful attraction out of what would otherwise be dead time. It's a great outing for thw whole family, including young children.."
,,Good!,4.0,,The concept is fantastic but couldn't spot many of the interesting animals. Mostly saw only bovines in different shapes. But no doubt a unique and at times a bit creepy. Takes at the most a couple of hours to complete the sight seeing.
,,Good place but bad timing,3.0,,"We planned to go night safari to get the different experience. We eat in zoo restaurant before ready to up in tram. We usually see the attraction or show. But dissapointed when we go there, cant see the animals clearly. I think maybe the aninals is tired or shy hahaha i will trying to go there if going to singapore again."
,,Needs to be on your bucket list,5.0,,"Does it compare with Sydney or Melbourne Zoos, NO. It's better, much more relaxed atmosphere, Kids would enjoy the nightly train ride through the zoo. If kids enjoy it, the adults would as well. A must do."
,,Disappointed,1.0,,I went to the night safari as part of a tour and paid for the safari and dinner and was disappointed. It's impossible to take pictures due the no flash policy which I understand but it takes away from the experience. The buffet dinner was not great. A better alternative is to do it on your own i.e. public transport or taxi and eat at one of the many food stalls which I believe will be better value. The animal show at 9.30 is not worth the 30 minutes that it lasts.
,,"It's great, but animals need more space.",3.0,,"I never visit Asian zoos for fear of seeing sad sights. This was a safari in Singapore and I thought I might give it a shot. We were pretty close to the animals and there were speakers on. Visitors continued to take pictures with flashes. Weren't these animals supposed to be resting at night?

I couldn't see very clearly how much there was per square foot for each animal but my estimation was that the space wasn't enough. It should be as close to its natural habitat.
Comparing to other Asian animal enclosures, I would say this was fairly good.

I remember the Melbourne Zoo where there was a pride of lions- they could roam around quite freely, quite close to their natural habitat.

The Night Safari was very crowded, the crowds were well managed. As you queued up, there were little built in seats where you could rest instead of standing in queue. We had to queue for 50 minutes for a 40 minute safari that costs 45 Singapore dollars. Was it worthwhile? Yes, it was, but I'll make this a one time visit for myself. I'd go again if I had to take visitors with me.

Animals need more space. They can't talk but they sure do have feelings especially if there's constant human interaction."
,,Interesting but not sure the animals are happy,3.0,,"We went to the night safari on our first night in Singapore as it had been recommended to us. It was quite a trek to get to it and I was worried about making sure we got around everything in time so we could get the last bus from the night safari!

The night safari itself was interesting and it was good to see the animals when they are more active at night but some of the animals seemed to be in distress which was not nice to see."
,,Walk rather than Ride,3.0,,"This would be a lovely experience, but it's difficult to see much of the animals from the train. They're fed exactly before the ride passes by so obviously doing their best to make sure you see the wildlife, but if you have the energy (and it's cooler in the evening anyway) definitely take the walking routes between the train stops."
,,Long queues,3.0,,After hearing such good reports of this activity I was disappointed. The crowds of people waiting for the entry was long and restrictions were in place to limit the number through at any one time.
,,A True Safari,5.0,,"Easy way in fact an awesome to explore Singapore zoo, Please manage timings as quick as possible to experience safari as well as other shows, We enjoyed the place. They are good enough to take huge queues easily and in an efficient manner"
,,Could have missed this.,2.0,,This place is far away from downtown. It was expensive. I didn't see as many nocturnal animals as I would've liked.
,,Great night out just didn't expect the overwhelming hordes of people,4.0,,"Great arena show started the evening, with wild animals which included a huge Otter, a young Ocelot & Python, trained to do some amazing tricks, with the help of children & teenagers from the audience. Then we took our places on our train which wound its way through the illuminated yet dark parkland. We were lucky to see Rhinoceros, a pride of Lions, Hippopotami, Wolves, several types of Deer, Anteaters , both the Giraffes & Tigers kept out of sight hidden in the darkness. However, who could fail to be impressed, we & our fellow guests were enchanted. Once outside in the restaurant & shop area we were treated to a wild spectacular display of fire eaters. Whilst we wouldn't have missed this experience, I wish we'd known just how crowded it would be, how hot. Could have done with the whole evening being perhaps an hour shorter ! If we felt this then seeing parents carry their sleeping children to the coaches only compounded our feeling that everyone would have liked to be back to their hotels much sooner ! We were ordering room service around midnight, having left at 6pm."
,,Very good...but!,4.0,,Wonderful to watch the animals behave as they would in nature at night time. Cleaver subtle lights make it possible for us to see them. Alas the queues to get in do rather spoil the evening. It didn't help that it was also raining but I can't blame the zoo for that! May be going at a different time in the year would be better but I don't know when that might be.
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,I can't find the words to tell you how good this is and i wouldn't want to spoil the surprise. Don't miss it is all i can say
,,Must visit for all age groups,5.0,,Night safari is an truly unique experience for all ages groups where we can see all types of animals in open enclosure and closely. Every place in the safari is well maintained by the authorities.
,,Superb night safari,5.0,,We decided to try the safari at night. It was well worth it. The zoo was efficiently run and the animals well looked after. I would recommend both the tram ride and the walking around the different areas.
,,Excellent - especially in VIP buggy,5.0,,"Late review but the night safari in Singapore Zoo is excellent, especially if you do it privately in a VIP buggy - in my opinion worth every cent! Have done it twice now with different visitors and have loved it everytime."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Singapore's night Safari is a must do for anyone visiting Singapore. It's such a unique experience to see the nocturnal animals in the incredible setting that the night safari offers.

The shows are great. If going you want to get there for around 7pm.

Most visitors will take be tram around which I would highly recommend for sure, but if you allow enough time, the walking trails offer some things you won't see from the tram that are well worth the extra effort to get to.

While not the big draw items like the leopards and tigers, my favourite of all here is the fruit bat enclosure. Getting so close and having them fly around you in the night is really special.

Which is best, Singapore Zoo, night safari, river safari or bird park? I would have to say the Singapore Zoo, however, the night safari is truly unique and something very different to experience. You shouldn't miss it."
,,Waste of Time,1.0,,"Booked in advance , great double decker busride , then it happened...arrived to find half of Mumbai already there. At ticket desk told 715 booking full so 815 available. After raising voices finally got in after lining up for 25 minutes.heded to Creatures of the night where for 15 minutes reminded to not use flashes, 5 minutes talk on recycling rubbish, 10 minutes showing a few animals. Lined up with 15000 people in lines with some pushing in .. lame 35 minute ""train "" ride thru the dark to look at a few animals. Could not get out of there fast enough along with a few other Aussies who all had same experience...NOT RECOMMENDED.."
,,Waste of time & money,1.0,,"A wasted evening in Singapore. Tried to make us wait over 1 1/2 hrs just to enter (even though we'd booked). When we finally get through, after waiting in queues for ages in the stifling heat it was to see a very ordinary show and then heralded like sheep along canals with hundreds of other people to get on the night safari. We did see a couple of animals (mostly deer) but definitely not worth the cost or time. We were too exhausted to even walk some of the animal trails. It was SO crowded and poorly managed. I would not recommend this at all."
,,I'm a local and this is my favourite attraction,5.0,,"Been here at least 5 times, and always charmed by the place. Well maintained (well you really can't tell because it's so dark, but so this could be a bias,) wide variety of animals that you don't typically get to see up close.
Tip!
1. Definitely buy the ticket with the tram ride - it's worth every penny.
2. Do still walk on all trails - all animals are worth seeing
3. Come on weekends - they let more animals out on weekends. It may be crowded but it's worth it
4. If you see a man feeding the animals and doesn't look like he is flouting the law, do talk to him, he is likely to be the keeper, and the keepers are generally friendly and happy to share little nuggets of information on the safari/animals
5. Arrive at 7pm and stay until 11pm if you can. Spend some time with the bat enclosure or reciting a poem to the Owls if you run out of things to do"
,,"""Urban Rainforest""",4.0,,A very organized conservation area within the city! I think it's a must when visiting SG. Happy that my son enjoyed it. Made me feel he appreciated nature. Quite far though and be prepared to sweat. So put on your most comfy clothes. But staff are nice and knowledgeable.
,,Night at the safari!,4.0,,"Nice place!! Didnt expect it to be super crowded, considering next day to be a working day. Luckily we got priority queue and did not have to wait behind that at least 1000 visitors.

Overall was great experience except for 1 visitor who took flash photography and the guide insisted on chasing him out of her tram. Whole episode was ugly and waste at least half an hour.

Price was very expensive for a short visit. Will be a long time before i will go again but its really great!"
,,Night Safari is very unique experience.,5.0,,It is good to see wild animals out in the open and not in the cage. Very well maintained and organised facility. You will see lot of animals from close. Make sure that you include night safari in your itinerary.
,,Disappointing Night at the Zoo,2.0,,"The Night safari is very popular and, like others, I read how it was best to visit the zoo at night to see the nocturnal animals feeding and at play. Unfortunately hundreds if not thousands of others thought the same. Arriving 2 hours before the opening of the Night Zoo (and after one and a quarter hours on a train-bus combination to get there from our hotel in Orchard Road), we queued for 30 minutes to buy our tickets the queued again for almost an hour to access the tram that took us around the tracks to see the animals. Missing was the giraffes, the wolves, the bears but there were plenty of deer varieties. And, surprisingly, there was no sign of the panda that features on the promotional posters around Singapore.
I would advise anyone contemplating visiting the Night Zoo to buy the express package to minimise (not avoid), queuing and to expect to not see anywhere near all the animals-although plenty of deer!"
,,Fabulous Night!,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the Night Safari. It was amazing to see animals during the evening roaming about as they would in the wild. Highly recommended!!
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"A must do, just to see animals in a well kept and maintained zoo. It's obvious that sadly, some of these animals are now rare in the wild, zoos and breeding programmes such as this will hopefully replenish their stocks in the wild."
,,Really exhausting!!!!!,1.0,,"I think I picked the worst night of the year! I arrived at 6:45 in the evening, missed the 7:15 tour as it was already sold out and waited for the 8:15 tour! By 8:45 we still hadn't got on a tram! I'm sorry I am so exhausted that I can't think of anything good to say!!!"
,,"Hot and crowded, but must see if you love animals",4.0,,"We bought tickets online and it offers some discount. So dont forget to check that out before going. It was hot and humid. You will want to plan your walking route and tram timing earlier. Come earlier so you get in front of entrance queue especially at weekend to avoid spending time waiting to get on the tram if thats what you intend to do first. Else take a walk first and come back for the tram later to avoid the long queue at the start. The timing for the animal shows are limited, so you will want to plan that correctly in your itinerary.

The place is well mantained considering the age of the attraction place. Staffs are polite and professional."
,,"Crowded, unpleasant, expensive. Unhelpful staff.",1.0,,"We had booked to attend in advance with a time slot, but we still had to queue for ages to get in. We were then herded into another enormous, squashed and uncomfortable queue to try to attend the creatures of the night show, which was cancelled with no notice just as it should have started. Everyone then wanted a tram ride, but after waiting ten minutes and moving nowhere we realised this just wasn't going to happen and went walking on the trails, which were very dark and rather slippery. We didn't really see a lot. Staff that we asked for advice quite frankly couldn't care less. We did eventually get in to the creatures of the night show at 9.30. We shouldn't have bothered, it was awful. A tired formula, not much variety and few animals. Give this one a miss."
,,Nice safari,5.0,,A must do activity in Singapore especially for family with young children very well organised trips in late evenings very nice
,,Good experience!,4.0,,"My husband and I were told about the night zoo by several friends and that it was a must see attraction. We purchased the 2 park hopper ticket (zoo and night safari) as it worked out as $59 each so it was a good deal. There is a 4 park ticket for $69 which includes the bird park and the river safari but we simply didn't have enough time. Our time for the night safari entrance was 7.15pm and we were queuing to enter well before 7pm. We queued for the tram and didn't see the show that was on and we still didn't get on the tram until close to 8pm. Some of the animals are hard to see, others are very easy! The bull elephants looked amazing! The tram ride takes around a half hour I believe then we completed the walking trails. They didn't take too long either and were a pleasant walk.
The reason why I didn't score it 5 out of 5 was due to the staggering amount of people that were there which dampens the experience a bit. What tends to happen is that large groups of people stand at attractions for various lengths of time blocking the view of others or they stand blocking the path!
Note- the zoo and night safari are far from anything else so we would recommend that if your coming for the night safari -eat before you arrive. As mentioned in other reviews food here is very expensive!
We visited both the zoo and the night safari in one day which made our day extremely long but we still enjoyed it and we felt that this was the best option for us considering our time restraints."
,,Night tour,4.0,,We had a lovely visit to this zoo. The animals have large open spaces and look well fed and healthy.
,,Eat before you go.,3.0,,"The night Safari is ok.
Nothing really special.
Most of the animals are hard to see but it's night time, so expected.
The big disappointment are the restaurants and food outlets.
The zoo is miles from no where so there is no where else to eat, except there and they know it.
Prices are outrageously expensive, the sort of prices you would expect of a high end city restaurant.
I paid $27.60 for two tubs of gelato ice cream that held two scoops each. Anywhere else they would have cost at most $12.00 to $14.00 for two.
The ticket office opens at 5:30 for the 7:15 show. If you are waiting, beware, there is no where to sit except at the tables reserved for restaurant and bar patrons. Another way to entice you to spend big on their food.
There is no seating in the public areas.
A potentially great tourist attraction spoiled by blatant profiteering."
,,An experience of a lifetime,5.0,,"This was my second time to go to Night Safari but the recent one was more memorable. I enjoyed it so much because my kids were with me and they enjoyed the show. We were a group of 8 adults and 5 kids and this man named Roy heard us talking about getting in for the show or watching the fire show outside first. He was so kind enough to assist us with the schedule and made a reservation for us in the show because we have a person with disability and elderlies with us. It was such a smooth adventure, I must say. And we enjoyed the show so much because it was sooooo hilarious. The host was so funny!"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Strongly recommended to anyone going to Singapore. Don't miss this amazing Night Safari. I've been there a few times but I never get bored and I don't mind go again....
,,Fire show afterwards was great,4.0,,"Rode the 'train' around to watch the animals eating their dinner. The highlight for me was the fire show afterwards, with three young men performing fire stunts. Worth a visit."
,,Nicer option than the Zoo,5.0,,"Go here during sunny season so you'll get to get off at the unbeaten tracks where you can see the animals up close and personal. There are also bat sanctuaries which hosts a lot of huge bats, almost 3 feet high. Flash photography is not allowed but there are still a lot of violators."
,,Good to visit once,4.0,,"I have been to night safari twice. Absolutely no change at all. The zoo is shown in night in a tram. Some different shows can be shown,"
,,Average,3.0,,"To be very honest, yes this is an experience but if you have done the regular day trip to the Singapore Zoo,there is no point doing this as well as it gets very tiring.
The concept is nice,to take us into the wild at night and you can see a lot of animals as well but I enjoyed the zoo more. They have a post show as well which is fun for the kids.
Again purchase online as you get good discounts on multiple attraction pass."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Definitely a must do in Singapore. The lines might be long but it's worth it. You can see what the animals are doing during night time.
,,Novel way to see Animals,5.0,,"This is surely unique as the Night Safari is home to over 1500 species of animals, birds, insects and creatures all of which are noctural and are active at night. The conditions created are such that the lights are strategically placed and it looks like moon light.One can first see the entire zoo sitting on an open tram. Some animals can be seen clearly but some cannot so what is recommended is a walk after the tram ride. One can watch several shows (Creatures of the Night) all throughout the evening and night or take a walk and see the night animals up close. A real enchanting experience. The cost of the ticket includes a pickup from the hotel in the evening at 5:30pm SGT in an air conditioned bus and then change into a larger bus which brings everyone to the entrance of the night safari by 6:30pm. Again a must do for all first time visits to Singapore."
,,"An absolute Singapore ""Must Do""",5.0,,"Something that cant be missed when visiting Singapore. The night safari was everything we had hoped for - there were less crowds and the animals were much more active - especially if you were quiet. A couple of noisy family groups came along now and then and the animals all retreated into the dark, but they soon came out again if you waited. The tram ride to see the bigger game was amazing and not to be missed. The nightly show ""Creatures of the night"" was pretty tacky and I wouldn't bother unless you are 5 or have young children. One big tip - eat before you arrive. Prices at the venue are exorbitant and the variety limited. We simply were not prepared to pay 4 x the price of a similar meal back in the city and the drinks were triple the price as well. Because of the start time we caught a cab and it was under $20. Fast efficient and air conditioned!!"
,,Did not like it at all - too much show,1.0,,"We did the tour on a wednesday evening and still, it was super crowded. They habitats looked extremely tiny and i felt sorry for the animals. The male elephants were not with the herd ( not sure why, there might be a good explanation for that, or not...) but by themselves and shaking their heads from one side to the other, and there was simply no way to hide or go. I feld sorry for them. The Lions were not moving at all, which was kind of odd. The guide was a electronic voice and the car/train was uncomfortable. I undertstand the idea of the safari but did not like the implementation at all. Give the animals more space. The show ""creatures of the night"" was ridiculous. Why would you do that in the first place?! Then again, the otter that managed to recycle the cans into the bin was probably the highlight of the whole night"
,,A must see in SIngapore!,5.0,,"We booked this trip through our hotel, and it cost about $15 USD per person more this way. However, it included transportation to and from the safari on air conditioned bus, and cut the line privileges for the crowded tram ride (the line for the tram was about 45 minutes long, but we got right on). This was a nice little trip through the rain forest. The park is small but cute. There are two shows, one is large, with some animals who do small tricks, and the other is very small, a fire dancing show which was located right at the entrance. I was a little disappointed by the shows, but overall, the safari/tram ride seeing the animals up close made the trip worth while!!

We were travelling with two older ladies, one of which was in a wheelchair, and the park (including tram ride) was easily manageable. There are walking paths to view the animals as well as the tram, but we did not participate in these, as we opted to see the shows instead, since our time was limited."
,,Open your eyes don't close them coz theres a lot to come,4.0,,"Well i know everyone wil be tired by the time you reach for night safari. Watch the shows ,Splash some water on your face and look at the mightyasian lion , the huge elephants , the roaring tiger , the giraffes ,the zebras,the african white lion and many more animals. Bon Voyage"
,,Excellent!,5.0,,You have the option to stay on the tram or get off and walk around places. Some days nd times you will be able to see the animals being fed such as the Lions. A wonderful experience for a zoo.
,,Very different experience of a Safari,5.0,,"It was really crowded when we entered the park. As we were waiting to enter the night safari, we were enthralled by the fire show at the entrance. Then we took the tram ride through the park to see the animals during the night."
,,Generally speaking,5.0,,Situated in Singapore Zoo. Real fun when you see all the animal in night. For kid's it's thrilling. You can either take tram or track .
,,Lots of fun,4.0,,"Fun evening,moots to see. Did the tram ride first then walked around the park. Tried to pre-book tickets for discount but didn't work online - they honoured the discount for us. The park is a bit inconvenient to get to - long train and bus ride."
,,Do this if you have energy and time,3.0,,"The bus/train ride going to the zoo is a long one from the city center. We were actually very tired already coming from various spots in the city so when we arrived at the zoo, it was almost evening and we were really tired.

We had to wait for the opening of the night safari and there's really nothing to do while waiting.

When we finally got inside, there were several animal shows on scheduled intervals, walk-by trails and tram trails. Other animals are not really visible because some areas are really dark and from what I learned, they intend to mimic their habitat. This also means flash photography is not allowed. I think I only saw around half of the animals and the rest, I just saw the labels and pictures. Some of the paths are also not lit so it was a bit scary.

The experience was still nonetheless worth it."
,,Good experience,4.0,,"This isn't a replacement for a real safari but good fun all the same. We opted for a package for the night which made everything very straightforward. We were picked up on time at our hotel and taken to the safari/zoo area, north of the island. We had dinner included which was a fairly extensive decent 3 course buffet although time was a bit rushed. The tram ride was around 40mins with a very good guide on board. All the animals were outside in their compounds, some very close to the tram.
There are various walking tours, around 20 mins each where you can see more animals, close up.
The night finished with a show where more cute animals were brought out to a stage area where a very good host compared the show.
The transfer back to hotels was again smooth with no issues.
All in all, a fairly enjoyable well organised night."
,,"Indeed for family, saex not reliable service",3.0,,"I went there with my big family it includes my dad, mom, aunt and my brothers family it could have been perfect but it was almost spoiled by saex ( singapore attraction express) its the bus that will lead you directly to night safari. I checked their website to make sure the time and location, buts its almost an hour and no bus show up, i called them to confirm if any bus is coming and they cant answer me directly, imagine having seniors and kids with me. After a 5 minutes argument finally the bus arrived. I dont recommend using saex but its one of the bus that will lead you directly to night safari, called them or email them to confirm their bus schedule."
,,Night Safari was good fun!,5.0,,"My friend and I did the night safari carriage that took you around to see all the animals which was fun. Takes around 40 mins.
No flash photography is allowed, but plenty of morons do it and had to be told about 7 times. There's a heap of places to eat at too before you go, also a stage show but we didn't see that."
,,A split vote.,4.0,,"My wife thought it excellent. Get advance tickets for 2030 or later. If you go for dusk it will be about 30 minutes shuffling up the queue to the trams. Worth doing the night show before the tram - only 20 minutes but will fill an hour; you will also find the better eatery on the way.
This is not a zoo extension but a standalone facility. Don't expect all the animals to be awake. If you're fit take the walking trails and see much more."
,,A night out in forest,4.0,,"Night safari is one of the selections if you are planning a night activity with kids and family. The experience is interesting, and my kids love it. A must try experience is the night tram around the park. Keep your eyes widely opened on the tram, as the animals are just awake! Ticket is reasonable. Remember to wear trousers in order to avoid insect bites."
,,Good but not amazing,4.0,,It's definitely a good experience and the animal show at the end is quite entertaining but don't. You have to do the walking tour as well as the tram otherwise it can be a bit dull. Nonetheless I enjoyed it and would recommend it!
,,Tourist,5.0,,Family entertainment for all travelers. Night safari is a must place to visit .no one should miss this place
,,Night to remember ...,5.0,,There is shuttle bus to take you to this attraction ... We were lucky to avoid crowd as we were told it can be crowded ... We had night to remember as we saw many animals upclose in their natural surroundings ...
,,Great idea,5.0,,We wouldn't normally go to a zoo but really glad we chose this one. Saw lots of animals that only come out at night and saved our legs with the little open train that goes around the site. Well worth a visit.
,,Singapore night safari,1.0,,It's not one of the best tours I've been on. My husband and I found it a little bit boring. The thing is when you are there you are a captive audience. If you have children I can see the appeal. This is my own view. However other people on the tram said the same.
,,Best of the Parks in Singapore,5.0,,"Personally, this is my favourite park amongst the Zoo, Bird Park and River Safari.
There are seriously so many interesting animals and birds to encounter along the way, and very often right up to your face. It is a wonder how come these animals do not bite! haha! Take the tram ride, but my advice is that you SHOULD stop at every stop and walk the trails in that area, lest you miss out all the fun and close encounters with exotic animals."
,,A must see,4.0,,"You cant see Singapore and not to go to the night safari. I gave 4 stars and not 5 as they have long lines and the habitats windows are in most cases foggy and you can not see the animals so good. The humidity is hard on me .... But the area is interasting, the idea is great and it is a must to experiance."
,,Too many Japanese !,3.0,,"When we arrived, we found too many people quene up to enter, Oh ! My God ! When we get inside, too many people quene for the car trip ! When we went to animal show, most of the people were from Japanese, the show was design for Japanese ! Too boring ! Walking was the best time inside. Many people left the Safari after 9:00p.m., no need to quene up for the car trip late at night."
,,Best night attraction in Singapore!!,5.0,,"Had a fantastic night at the Singapore night safari. There is a shuttle bus that picks you up from various stops around Singapore. The atmosphere was amazing as the night started with fire breathing show, there are many restaurants to choose from for dinner. There is the choice of walking around the park or catching an open air tram with a guide talking you through the park. We did both but enjoyed the self walking tour more as you can get closer to the animals and watch them. We had a fantastic night and would go back again for sure, highly recommended!!"
,,Night safar,4.0,,"We didn't visit during the day but joined one of the organised night safaris. The 'safari' in a motorised train, was pretty interesting and we saw a good range of animals. The free time was the best part when we followed walking trails and got quite clos to a lot of animals. The show at the end of the tour was disappointing and likely to appeal mostly to the youngsters. Average value for money."
,,Best thing in Singapore,5.0,,"We have seen many zoo's in europe, but taking this night safari tour in Singapore was the best decision ever! The sensation you have when you ride so close to wild animals is incredible! I would totally repeat this if i ever come to Singapore. Make sure you book your tickets online, so you dont have any pressure you might not get one at the entry, as the number of tickets at the entrance is limited."
,,Better than expected,4.0,,"We had heard such mixed reviews but we're very pleasantly surprised by how many animals we saw and how close they were. Very well organized with plenty to do for the evening, especially if you do he walk trails as well. Wish we 'd had the grandchildren with us as they would have loved it."
,,World class customer service,5.0,,"Firstly I applaud the park attendants for diligently checking tickets and enforcing the timed admission.
We were two families with young kids, and one of the attendants noticed that our party was outnumbered by the kids (4adults, 5young kids), and very kindly fast tracked us to the priority area of the tram queue. Really appreciated that kind gesture.
Kudos to the gelato shop at the park's entrance. Was close to midnight n the shop was closing (I think they'd shut down the cash register when we got there). Yet they very kindly ""re-open"" to serve us when our kiddos wanted gelato. They got to entertain a few other customers after us in the process
Because we drove in with a foreign registered car, upon leaving the park we went to enquire about topping up our Autopass to pay for car park. We were told that facility is not available on site, and we actually had to purchase a car park ticket from the park itself. As the park's ticketing system had been shut down for the night at the time we made the enquire, the service staff very graciously presented us with a complimentary parking ticket to resolve our problem! To top it off, as we were just about to exit the car park, we realised we had dropped and lost our Autopass! My husband ran back to the park entrance to seek assistance, and amazingly the park had our Autopass in their lost and found facility!!! A truly world class service experience. Well done Singapore!!"
,,Not a must-do,3.0,,"There is alot of animals here, but unfortunatly you wont be able to see all of them because its night, and because of respect to the animals there is no light here. If you want to take pictures, DO NOT come here. Blitz are not allowed. However, seeing this through your own eyes was OK. The Lion impressed me."
,,A well-planned and enjoyable Night Safari,4.0,,"Since I could not go on the Night Safari in the earlier trips, I made it a point to go this time with family. There was a good crowd on friday evening when we reached there. But the arrangements were good and well-organized. We had our dinner and started on the Safari at 8:15 p.m. The tram ride showed us the layout and we were able to see some of the animals / birds. But most enjoyable was the Trek to see these animals. Walking in cool night with soft lights to guide us was a nice experience. We were able to take time to see the animals in their natural habitat. Since most animals are nocturnal in nature, it was nice to see them in the night. Overall it was a really nice experience."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,First time having a zoo visit at night. The animals are not hiding from the heat and you get a chance for a close view of most of them. A place to go as a couple for a nice evening
,,Not really a safari...,3.0,,It's more like the zoo at night. It was awesome how close you were to the animals! But a lot of them were hiding out of the light or sleeping. About half of the animals were deer. Would have liked more variance. Some of the walking pathways are really dark so be careful there. It was hot as heck and we did the late show (8:15pm) so I can't imagine during the day! We couldn't find the supposed fire show. It was fun though but not sure if it was worth a 30 minute cab ride each way from the city center. We were done with it in less than 2 hours.
,,Must Visit Place for Animal Lovers,4.0,,A well managed place where you can find animals from around the world. One can take a Tram & roam around to have a new experience.
,,Not Photos Allowed,5.0,,"We had a lot of fun riding the tram at the night Zoo. Despite the chaos, we were able to get some special treatment due to out handicapped son. The tram was good through the tour. We just missed the show afterward but overall it was a fun time."
,,Night safari,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit. Seeing animals close up was amazing. Well organised - would get there early and also do the walking tours
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"I'm 28 and have lived in Singapore my entire life, and this was my first time visiting the night safari. I have to say it was AMAZING!!! It doesn't have as many animals as the day zoo, but we took the tram and you really get up close with some of the animals. I swear the deer, tapir and cows were about 2 to 3 feet away from me!!!

The tram ride and animal show were included in the standard ticket, so that was nice. I wish there was more of a raccoon appearance at the show, but overall it was really cute and fun to watch. I felt the ulu ulu restaurant was quite pricey, given it was just a fancier hawker centre. But overall, I love the experience and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
,,Nice but misleading name,3.0,,"Essentially this is a zoo you visit at night time.

It was nice to see the animals in quite spacious areas but we were disappointed by the fact that this was a zoo and not, in fact, a safari.

There are rather a lot of different types of cattle and deer with a tiger, lion, rhino, elephant peppered in between.

The team ride is a nice way to see all the animals but the highlight of the zoo is the Creatures of the Night show. I would suggest you do not kiss this especially if you have young children as it is a chance for them to see some cute animals up close and learn a bit more about them. The presenter was funny and entertaining and we enjoyed the show very much.

I would definitely suggest trying Uber or the MRT as taxis, like most things in Singapore, are extortionate especially after 7pm."
,,Not so worthy,3.0,,there are animals to see but some of them are just resting because of which we are unable to see them. little bit scary too.
,,Wish it had that little bit more,4.0,,"Overall had a very good experience at the Night Safari, the shows with men playing with fire and this lady with the animals was truly great and fun! The animals themselves you see by a cart that drives slowly by them, you can't use your flash as it will drive the animals crazy so unless you have a professional camera you won't be able to see the animals clearly via a mobile phone I.e Iphone etc which slightly spoils the experience for me personally yes you can see the tigers/lions with the naked eye but as the way you with things you want pictures for your holiday and when they don't turn out great it becomes a dissapointment.. I wished I visited the zoo during the day!"
,,A Fun Experience for All,5.0,,"Reading the reviews, I couldn't get a handle on how to get there and exactly what to do, so I'm writing this to perhaps help others who are in the same quandary.
We ended up signing up for the Viator Tour and it was a wise decision. We were picked up at our hotel in a small van and driven to a central location where other vans met up. We then boarded a bus and on the way out of town to the zoo, given information on what would be happening, and where to meet afterward. We did not opt for the dinner and for us this worked.
We started by walking around with the group seeing night small animals like the cat which fished at night and many others. Often you would hear, ""Ooh, look,"" and we all did. After a period of time we all walked to the tram lines and boarded a tram for the Night Safari which was very interesting for all. We then had a break to grab an ice cream, beer, or other treat, eat, and then head to to line for the night show in an outdoor amphitheater. The show was a bit predictable and more for children who loved it, but probably worth seeing.
When everything was over we knew where to meet and re-boarded the bus and headed back.
As I said, this could be done by yourself, but this way worked well for us, making things easier and our guide was excellent. I would recommend it."
,,The best animal park of Singapore,5.0,,"By far the largest this is divided in 2 sections, one for walking and one for driving with the included train. People who have night blindness will have problems seeing the animals and remember your insect repellent. Most of the animals though you hardly meet anywhere els, like the Borneo Tarsier or the hog badger."
,,AWESOME,5.0,,"Good to go with family.......... awesome to see all animals in night time that too in open environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
,,"More of a Theme Park, but still enjoyable",3.0,,"The train ride safari was a bit slow at first, but picked up during the second half with elephants, tigers, etc. food / gift shop etc was VERY expensive. The 'creatures of the night' show was pretty poor. We waited for a long time for seats / for the show to start, then it was over and i didn't feel we'd seen that many animals. Maybe it was more aimed at children. I came away feeling i'd enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the fun experience i'd expected."
,,Spend an enjoyable late evening among the animals:,5.0,,"The animals are all trained to pose when your train passes by. Well planned but it is all artificial, not natural. Still worth a visit. Enjoy the cocoanut water served there (quite expensive though)"
,,The night Safari is a great experience,4.0,,Don't miss your chance to visit the Singapore night safari at the zoo as the kids will love it! It great do see a zoo in a different light literally. It's easy going as you catch a shuttle around so don't have to worry about whinging kids too much which is always a plus. Add it to the list while in Singapore
,,Watch animals behaviour at night,5.0,,Great place to see animals during the night time. Advisable to take the tram ride that will take you slowly to the night trails which you can see the all the animals. Recommended for families with kids.
,,Amazing Experience !,5.0,,"I was under the impression that animals will be caged and we have to search for them. Surprisingly, Lions and major carnivorous animals are left open to have a better view for the tourist. It is one of kinds experience and a mist do thing in Singapore. About 40$ is the cost, but it you buy it online, its cheap around 35$."
,,Unbelievable night experience with Animals,5.0,,"The night safari was my highlight in Singapore. The barriers are so well hidden you feel unbelievably close to the animals...like they could get to you! Such intimate time with the nocturnal animals. We walked through half of the zoo and took the safari train the remainder. Quite large and definitely worth going twice to really enjoy everything. My favorite was the rescued orphaned elephant who greeted us and walked by our train along our path. Being in the bat area with gigantic Indonesian bats hanging above us was terrific too.
Kids of all ages love this unique night experience."
,,Would have liked to stay longer,3.0,,"Only spent 3 hours here, 1 hour was used up getting food (which was good) The attractions itself were really fun but would have loved to spend longer there and it was sometimes hard to see the animals as it was dark."
,,Good fun night nice and quiet late on,4.0,,"Went to the night zoo using public transport (MRT and bus). Must admit it takes a long time to get there (over an hour) but we had already paid for our 3 day travel pass. Arrived at 9.15pm and everyone appeared to be leaving. We were on the safari tram and exploring the zoo within 5 minutes of getting there. Zoo was really good and peaceful and had just enough time to walk all the walk trails. Another hour would have been good.

Last busses are at 12.15am but take no notice of this. We took the 11pm bus but by the time we were on the train and needed to change lines to get to Clarke quay/china town the trains had stopped running so needed to jump in a taxi!!!

Well worth a visit but make sure you plan getting there and back!!"
,,not what you would expect in a city,5.0,,this was good value as had the dinner package which allowed plenty of time to eat and see the animals in their nocturnal life
,,"Big day, but worth it",5.0,,"We combined a river safari and night safari in one day. Very long day that saw us back to our studio near midnight but it was a great day.
Suggest for a family with young ones, it would be best split over a couple of days.
The creatures of the night show was very slick and amusing. My daughter was called up on stage, which made her night!
The other main attraction is the tram ride around the night safari part of the zoo. It takes about 20 mins to get around seeing a vast array of Asian and African animals, with a recorded soundtrack describing the animals and providing some short facts on each.
We then took a walk on the leopard trail and spent a bit more time looking at some of our favorites."
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,"Well there are two parts to it -

1) walking trails - here you cover half of the safari getting to have a closer look at the animals. Takes about 1-2 hours depending on your speed.

2) Tram ride - they take you on a tram ride to see the bigger/wilder animals with a recorded voice that explains all you need to know about the animal.

Do not miss the Thumbuakar show and also the Creatures of the Night show."
,,A different way to enjoy the zoo!,4.0,,"My wife and I used the MRT railway and bus to travel from downtown Singapore to the Night Safari at Singapore Zoo. The trains and buses run frequently and all of our connections worked perfectly. Consequently, our outbound journey took no more than 75 minutes and the return journey was under 1 hour.

It is important to book zoo tickets on-line, to guarantee prompt admission and benefit from a 10% discount off the gate price. Also, it is best to opt for the 7:15 admission time and arrive before 7 pm, because there is so much to see and do,

Upon arrival, we saw the Thumbuakar act, a group of energetic dancers and fire-eaters. Then, we passed through the turnstiles and queued to board one of the electric powered trams. 15 minutes later, we started our circuit around the zoo, with an interesting commentary in English. As expected, we saw many of the animals en route.. Following the tram ride, we entered the zoo again on foot for a walking tour, to see areas and other animals, which were inaccessible to the trams. Time flew, and we did not depart until 10 pm."
,,Fascinating place for family with kids,4.0,,A nice park. Presentation of animals is very nice. The tram ride is a little disappointing. The trails are very nice. I was there with a colleague. We felt the attraction will be great for children. For us it was a little boring. The tickets are quite expensive ($45)
,,awesome experience,5.0,,this was my first time in the dark and seeing animals without any barriers expect for potentially dangerous animals like the cheetah.it was a very good experience and I wish I want to do it again
,,'Waste Of Precious Time',1.0,,"I don't enjoy giving bad reviews but Tripadvisor is all about honest reviews so here it goes. With limited time in Singapore many friends advised us not to miss out on going to the Night Safari. It's great, fantastic, amazing were some comments by our friends so we thought must be good so we put it on the list. We left Suntec Centre on our Duck & Hippo Sight Seeing Group(another review) tour bus around 5.30 - 6.00 cannot remember exact time. Many other tour groups offer deals as well. About what seemed a 30-40 minute drive we arrived to a carpark of buses and cars. Upon entering front entrance it was like OMG look at how many people are lined up. Stood in line for about 30 minutes now dusk they open the gates. Everyone races again to line up to get on the safari trams about an eight or ten seat open buggy style bus/buggy at 5 minute intervals. Oh great another wait, the line constantly moves but its another 15 minute wait. Finally we are on our way with our driver and guide speaker who spoke so fast and muffled through the microphone l could not catch a word she was saying and l was sitting in the front row in front of her. Ok l'm now getting excited as we drive slowly along the road with thick lush jungle like plants and it's nice and dark. I'm thinking we are going to see some wonderful animals in their habitat. Now when a person visits a zoo they expect to see a variety of animals don't they. A lot of enclosures are open of course the animals won't jump out as they can't but obviously they have just been fed so are quite relaxed resting or just no where to be seen. We passed a lot of enclosures and seen some lions, an elephant, a leopard, some deer, some type of cow or buffalo, some more deer, some more deer oh and let's not forget some more deer and several other variety of bovine animals. Apparently we passed a zebra, giraffe, wallaby and invisible animals as they were no where to be seen. Not even half way through and it wasnt that long, my husband and l lost interest. After we got off we had over an hour to wait before our return bus trip so even though there was food areas we had made other plans for dinner on our return so we just sat around. We did not want to wander off on path trails only to miss our ride home. Our interest was gone. Get me out of here.
Now to summarize if you want to go to the zoo go during the day, l am sure it is so much better and you can actually see a lot more animals by walking the foot trails. The Night Safari is a waste of time and money, sorry but l just cannot find so many varieties of one animal interesting with such a lead up to expect an amazing experience. Just because they are from different regions they all look pretty much the same, better still save your money and go to one of our own zoos here in Australian cities where we have an abundance of different animals. Sorry guys but it's a big NO GO from me for the Night Safari."
,,Great Night Zoo experiance,5.0,,"This wounderful and well arranged place can not be missed by any visitor to Singapore.
It starts their operations at 6.30 - 7.00 PM and it is little bit far a way from city center.
You can enjoy moving through the safari through train or by walking.

recommending this place highly"
,,Meh,2.0,,"Nothing special. Most of these animals were sleeping and both my friend and I agreed that it was boring. But check it out if you are still curious, especially if you never been to a night safari before. Personally, if I want to see animals in the dark, I would just break into the zoo after hours."
,,Good to do at least once,3.0,,"We stayed up late to see the night safari. It was worth doing once. We did this a couple of times and after the first time you realise it's not as great as he first. So recommend this just once.

It's on late so have to stay up late, kids enjoyed it. You sit on the shuttle bus which takes you round. It's not very long but you do get to see the animals. If limited for time skip this and just do the zoo which is excellent.

There is a fire show before hand. The food is slightly better here."
,,5 Day stay,5.0,,"Fantastic Zoo, well worth the money, we did the Night Safari on first visit to Singapore about 10 years ago. Still a fantastic visit."
,,Long long long queues for the tram on weekends,3.0,,"It was a nice experience specially for the kids however the wait time for the tram was way too long. It was almost for an hour and a half we had to keep standing in the longest queue ever. We went on a saturday evening. First there was a long queue for getting entry to the park. After around half an hour, we were finally able to enter the park. We then headed for the live animal show which was great. Various animals performed various activities with the instructors and it was all fun. It lasted for around half an hour. Then we headed to board the tram for the actual safari. The wait of around 1.5 hours in the hot and humid environment was real pain. Though they have some wall fans installed at various points but it was hardly any relief. Finally we got the chance to board the tram and the jungle safari started. It went along its predefined path covering various wild animals. Since it is all dark, dont bother taking photographs of the animals. Instead just have the pleasure of watching them and enjoy. It was a small ride of around 25 minutes. There is also a restaurant which seemed overpriced. Overall, it was a good experience which could have been much better had there been no queues."
,,A night to remember!,5.0,,"Going to a zoo or safari in the day is quite a thrill, but at night? That too in controlled surroundings? In the Night safari, You can get to see the majestic Asiatic lion and the Bengal or sumatran tigers, Flamingoes, the pink ladies that strut about in flocks so proud, the more sedate buffalo and cattle from the region, big cats and beavers, deer and their ilk, They are all there. Well, its an exhilarating experience to see the animals in the environment of their own and domesticated enough to allow you to pass by in a tram. you can also walk in different trails and see the performances of the animals of the night thats a very well orchestrated show. Basically a great experience for young and old. make sure you get to be there at sunset and then you can go through the selected places by walk. if you are hungry, dont worry, there are watering holes and enough eateries that will satisfy most palates. Ice creams for kids , plenty! whatever you do don't miss this pit stop in singapore. its great and kids will love you for it."
,,Must do if you have kids,4.0,,"Its a must do activity if you have kids, very well organised and worth the long queues. Don't worry if the ""q"" seem a bit long it gets over quite quickly. Its a beautiful experience."
,,Scary!,4.0,,"Perfect for families with younger children,up to 15ish. We enjoyed it, but you do it once. Really good organization and well worth staying up late for the kids. It is essential that the smaller children are prepared by there parents so they can be quiet and look and listen for the animals etc. Great fun."
,,Quite Small but quite fun,3.0,,"Albeit its size its quite small and the animal collection is not that many, it offers a night safari which is quite fun to ride a cart in the dark forest around several animals."
,,Great night safari trip!,5.0,,"Would recommend night safari and the shows were brilliant too. A must do in Singapore! We ate in the restaurant, food was reallu good."
,,Wonderful Event,5.0,,"Lovely to see the fire show and the animals at night. Can have long queues, and the queue jumpers are frustrating (watch out for these)."
,,Nice fun,5.0,,You can have a close look to the animals. Most of the animals are in open. They are not caged. You can enjoy the ride or walk around the park on foot.
,,Enchanting evening at the Night Safari..!,5.0,,"Went for the night safari on our last day at Singapore and what a brilliant evening it was..! Loved the ambiance..! People usually line up for the night safari ride, which is great, but you can give it a pass if you do a couple of the walking trails. The walking paths are well carved out and they make you feel as if you're in a jungle with superb footpaths..! Even if you do take the safari ride, for sure go on at least 3-4 of the walking trails. They've got a GREAT variety of animals which aren't visible from the safari ride..!"
,,Not recommended if you have seen the Zoo,3.0,,"Having already seen the zoo, this is not so exciting, as you would have already seen almost all the animals in the zoo. Only good thing is you watch it close and also during night."
,,A thrill seekers Safari,4.0,,"I bought combo tickets Hopper Pass online for Jurong bird Park, Singapore Zoo and night Safari with Tram ride for 88 SGD.
I had much expectations on night safari...
It opened gates at 6 30PM and the crowd gathered more...and there was a food court with live African fire dance performance. The tram que was so long but was easily managed by the officials..The tram trolled inside the forest..and dim moon lighting was provided along the route..and I saw sm animals gazing at the darkness..I hardly saw many ..the tram ride was half an hr and it dropped us back at the start point...But I could say it was not worth much..jus for the sake of night drive experience inside a forest area..."
,,Only in Singapore lah,4.0,,"I always enjoy visiting this themed zoo, it's different from the regular ones. It opens at 6pm, after Singapore Zoo and River Safari closes. This is a must-not-miss attraction in Singapore."
,,Singapore must do experience,5.0,,"Singapore zoo is a unique place. The animals are not barred, just natural barriers. 'Most dangerous' part you'd pass on a train. Night safari is a very special experience. Do, do recommend. Jungle breakfast experience (preliminary booking is required) is a fantastic opportunity to grab a meal with apes and other animals (including charming orangoutangs)"
,,Good place to have fun with kids,4.0,,"We booked the tickets online, as it is much more convenient and cheaper. I would suggest you that the first slot for 7.15 pm if available. That was full so we took the second slot for 8.15pm. At the entrance there is a Thumbuakar performance which is very exciting as performers are throwing fire from there mouths. When we entered the tram had very long waiting time so we headed for the various trails inside wherein you can see animals very closely. Since the trails are dimly lit it adds to the adventure. Best is the Wallaby trail as we can walk through them. Malayan tiger is also not to be missed. When we went the tiger was sitting just near the glass window and was interacting very actively. It was a very nice experience. Once we did all the trails, we took the tram which was very informative. Also their Creatures of the Night show is awesome as they make small animals some very good stunts and it is very interactive with the audience."
,,Loved the night safari,5.0,,"The tram queue at the start was a bit off putting, but once aboard the tram this was forgotten!
Great seeing animals at night, the were a lot more active & vocal which we enjoyed.
The walks were quiet & we visited most animals alone

If combining with Zoo, book the 7:15 slot & start queuing at 6:30"
,,Unique experience but don't have high expectations,3.0,,Just visit the place for a unique experience and don't go with high expectations. There is an animal show as well and is worth watching it.
,,It was okay :),4.0,,Let's just say my husband loves animals a lot like a lot ! We bought the park hopper package from changi airport ... Spent the whole day at Singapore zoo and river safari followed by night safari ... I am scared of the dark so night safari wasn't that fun for me but the fire show and night safari show was really interesting ....there was a long queue so went to watch the show first and thn took the safari :)
,,Fun for All Ages - Put on your Walking Shoes!,5.0,,Wear comfortable clothes and shoes (sports shoes are even better) and enjoy the walking trails before taking the tram ride. You will see different animals on each - therefore you must do both of them! The lines for the tram ride are long just around the time the Creatures of the Night show are ending - so try to go for the tram half past the hour instead of on the hour. Definitely recommended for families and single adults alike.
,,Just once is Enough,4.0,,"Have not been to a night safari anywhere so, one experience is definately worth it. One show was cancelled due to weather conditions. Apart from that the other show was okay but kinda short and very less animals shown during the show. Expected a lot more animals.
Tram ride is good as it takes you through the jungle and you can see many animals during the night."
,,Disappointing Return to the Night Safari,2.0,,"Having been before, I was hugely disappointed with Night Safari tonight. The show ""Creatures of the Night"" was, frankly, dire. We had more warnings about not using flash photography than was the number of animals we saw during a 30 minute period we may never get back. The number of nocturnal animals also seemed to be down on the previous visit and those that we could make out in the gloom were usually asleep. When compared to the trip to the Zoo during daylight hours, I can only say that this experience is not one I would wish to repeat any time soon."
,,We did the night safari,3.0,,Although it was stinking hot it was still so relaxing walking around and seeing most of the animals at night. The only thing is the lights were very dim so it was a bit hard seeing all of the animals. The show was quite interesting as we got to see different types of animals and learn about them. Would probably go during the day especially with small children next time.
,,Disappointed this trip,3.0,,"Not as good as we remembered from last time. The show seemed alot shorter and more focused on the two random people chosen from the crowd than the animals, not enough animals showcased. The tram ride was still good but again we didn't seem to see as many animals, maybe they were just out of sight? Unfortunately I think this attraction has just become so popular and there are SO many people there it has detracted from how good it used to be."
,,Great but you need a good camera!!!,4.0,,"We visited the zoo earlier then waited to do the Night Safari - worth the wait but .....
at the beginning you felt as if you weare being treated as cattle as you were penned in and moved forward to the entrance in groups then when you got in it was a rush to the queue for the bus. After that it was brilliant and the commentary was entertaining, even the animals played along and were visible in the area they were supposed to be. Unfortunately none of our cameras were good enough to get really good clear pictures at night without a flash - the iphone was worse than useless and neith of our fujifilm cameras were sufisticated enough. After the tour we wlked among the exhibits and were fortunate in, again, seeing everything we wanted to see. A good evening out but it makes it a very long day when tagged onto a visit to the zoo as well."
,,A great adventure,5.0,,The night safari gave another aspect to the zoo. The highlight was the performance of the animals at the arena.The train ride through the zoo was great too. We got caught coming home though with a very expensive taxi fare as it was after midnight. Check you prices with the taxi driver before you leave and travel home before midnight.
,,Nice Experience,4.0,,"Its a good show and nice experience, mine was 1st in such kinds so personally liked it . Also its nice to see how well they have it all maintained."
,,Lots of animals,4.0,,"The Night safari was an enjoyable evening, plenty of interesting animals to see. Some animals weren't visible in their enclosures as they were probably sleeping but we saw a fair share of different animals anyway. Good fun!"
,,Good one,4.0,,Was nice but was expecting something more and unique.. Even the fire dancers were average. The live show too was just good. Good facilities and arrangements but not to the mark as hyped.
,,A new Experience,3.0,,"It was an amazing feeling to hear a tiger or a lion roar so near us at night. Eve though the guide kept on reminding us not to take any pictures or flash lights, my little girl did enjoy the experience."
,,Animals are Sleeping,2.0,,Remember these are not your usually night hunters. They are feed and trained for day activities since babyhood
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,It was great to wander around this park at night and see the creatures of the night. If you don't book a tour be prepared to queue though! Food was quite expensive and a general lack of seating unless you sit at the restaurants for food. Staff were helpful.
,,Full Zoo visit,5.0,,"Bought a combined ticket that included the river, day zoo and night safari. It was interesting seeing the animals at night and it was very atmospheric. The river region with the pandas was fascinating and well presented and we spent nearly 4 hours in this section. The route through the exhibits combined shaded paths with fans interspersed with cooler rooms and very few steps to navigate. The zoo appears to have considered carefully the access for buggies and wheelchairs users. The main zoo has ""free ranging"" apes/ monkeys and you can get reasonably close to them."
,,Different Experience,4.0,,"Night Safari was included in the combo tickets that included Jurong Bird Park, Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari, Amazon River Quest and River Safari Cruise.
Night Safari was great. It is one of a kind experience. Night Safari is not the same as Singapore Zoo. It is close to the zoo but have a different entry gate. Visitors are allowed inside the main entry gate but not inside the tram area where night safari begins until the time slot. Do not forget to get the park map on entry. We booked the 7:15 PM slot and we were there by 6:00 PM and was able to have dinner in one of the many restaurants. There is a food court with lot of restaurants that are open all the way from 5:00PM to 10:30PM.
There is a fire breathing show that starts at 7:00, 8:00 and 9:00 PM right outside the night safari entry area while waiting in line to enter the tram area. This show is not to be missed. It was awesome. It lasts for 10-15mins, however, they start allowing people inside for the tram. Therefore, you may have to come back again after the night safari ride to the main gate to watch the end of the show (next slot)
We thought the lines will be longer and crowded but to our surprise it was lot less crowded and shorter lines. Also the loading and unloading in the tram was smooth and orderly. We were lucky to see lot of animals including but not limited to lions, tigers, hyneas etc. From the map, we were able to plan a walking trails soon after the tram ride. We started from the main gate on a walking trail and went all the way around the park and came back to where we started. It took us an hour and we saw lot of animals that we did not see in the tram ride. There were couple places that had water fountains to fill up the water bottles. It was hot an humid but it did cool a bit little later.
We took the bus to the zoo/night safari and there were buses back to MRT station (Ang-Mo-Kio) from the night safari with regular frequency.
Overall, night safari is a different experience and definetly recommend for tourists."
,,refugee safari,2.0,,"its just that instead of zoo, similar animals are viewed in comfortable tram, with commentary and right light setting as if they are in moonlight. To get in we had to stand in a queue for full one hour. It was so exhausting. By the time we entered pram, our kid was asleep. they should give waiting facilities or use token to decide who all will enter first! this was an absolute low in my entire Singapore visit. I felt like a refugee trying to cross over!"
,,Do the full walk!,5.0,,"They offer a tram ride which to me, was alright; the animals you see on the ride and on the walk are a bit different with some overlaps. The most interesting part on the tram for me was seeing Malaysian tapirs sleeping on the street with no care.

The walks were the reason I would give this place 5 stars. Perhaps we were just lucky but we were able to see the tigers, leopards, hyenas, and many more pushed up right against the window, essentially 10 centimetres away from these magnificent animals. Never been so close before.

Most importantly, the animals looked extremely healthy and active compared to other places I have been to. In my home country, many zoos and such are shameful and mistreat animals disgustingly. At the Night Safari, all animals looked extremely healthy and it was great to see them in such condition."
,,Brill,5.0,,"Totally recommend for all ages. It's great to see all the animals active at night, and the tour was very informative. I recommend book the priority tickets before with the dinner included as the lines for the tram tour were extremely long."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,We were expecting much more at the Night Safara but found it very commercialised and the environment for the animals wasn't great in our opinion.
,,animals were mostly sleeping,3.0,,"animals are sleeping, some are hiding, but the last part was a lot of fun! more for kids, food inside are quirte expensive"
,,Holiday With Family & Friends,5.0,,"Beautiful place so clean and the animal enclosures where very impressive, natural to their own environment. We did the day zoo and also included the Night Safari great value for money. We arrived at 200pm and left at 9.30pm big day!! But worth doing so much to see and do night safari had a fire dancers a nocturnal animal show followed by a night safari seeing the animals at night fantastic must do"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Great to see the animals up close and active! The show was good. We did this first, then followed most of the walking trails before jumping on the tram to go around the park in full. We booked for the 8.15pm entrance and left the park around 11pm. It was a great experience. We also caught taxis there and back from our hotel - about $S30 each way."
,,Exciting,5.0,,"We went there many years back, when it was new and now came again. Much more animals now and bigger. You don't get to see every animal, it's up to them, but you see many. The best way is to avoid the queues for the train and start with the “walking tour” and finish with the train ride went most people have gone home. There are several restaurants at the entrance and you can have dinner there before the zoo opens, giving you more time for the animals. The show is a bit fun, with ingenuous ways of showing wild animals doing something naturally that becomes part of the show. However it was about 20 minutes tiresome speaker and 10 minutes animals."
,,Nothing that special,3.0,,"Perhaps if you have young children, but it is not really that unique. You ride a trolley thru landscaped grounds. A few wild animals are lazing next to the road separated from you by ditches. You see some elephants, a lion, rhino and alot of varieties of cows. Kids will like it. They have a show several times a night of some men eating fire and blowing fire. This is fun for five minutes. The most unique site there"
,,It's OK - Can't see many animals,3.0,,"Very busy attraction so go early. Can't see many animals as it's not well lit up and you are not allowed to use a camera, they are quiet strict but some people just don't listen. In my opinion they shouldn't be allowed to come on the ride."
,,Bad,2.0,,The animals alll sleep so cant see anything... All just dark...... Will not visit there again because very far from city....
,,fantastic wildlife park with a great emphasis on conservation,5.0,,what an amazing experience. animals are in full swing at night. the tram is great as well...lots of interesting information and you get ot see things you dont see when walking. definitely recommend the tram. its a little difficult to get to on public transport though so make sure you leave lots of time to get there and also have a plan on how to get back. trains and buses finish before the zoo closes.
,,Pretty good but.....,4.0,,"..... Don't make the mistake we did,eat beforehand somewhere else because it takes up time that you could do something else. Felt rushed because we ate there and time flew by and public transport only comes at certain times we had only time to eat,go on the bus tour,watch a show and then have a quick five minute walk before having to go! Otherwise it's a good experience"
,,So much fun!,4.0,,"It wasn't perfect, probably because there were too many tired children. But it really was a fun trip. The train tour was well managed but we especially enjoyed just walking about trying to spot the animals. Any worries that the lights would be too bright for the animals to be comfortable were unfounded. I'd recommend getting there as early as possible!"
,,Great,5.0,,"This Zoo is very high quality, and very well planned , a really good attraction for both adults and kids. The theme park nature of the view took us on an adventure trail with lots of surprises around each corner. For me the highlights were the massive white tigers, the pandas and the elephant show , all a must see. The night safari is a nice way to wind up the experience followed by a nice meal in the nice restaurants . Bring an umbrella"
,,Lovely show of night animals,5.0,,"Nicely managed show of night life in jungle. The animals lying around and fed nicely. The safari jeep made a little noise which was annoying, but otherwise great experience."
,,Well Maintained,4.0,,Good place to go with Kids. Entire zoo is well maintained and animals well treated. Must go place in Singapore.
,,One of the must do in Singapore,5.0,,Great place to visit. Nicely managed with fire show and nocturnal animal show. All locations cannot be covered with tram. Recommended to get down in between stations and take the walking trails. Nicely managed although its not that big. Don't forget to check the shuttle services while returning back which drops at famous hotel locations at an affordable price.
,,not worth the effort,3.0,,"I booked to go on a group tour and I was looking forward to this event but on the night I was there the animals in the show were not co-operative which I can understand and the fire show was a waste of time as I am short in stature and I could not see over people's heads - we had to stand behind a barrier to view it. The tram rime was quite good but, once again, the animals were not able to be seen easily. I would go to the Zoo and river safari in preference. The saving grace was that I met some lovely people on this tour"
,,Went there once,3.0,,"I Went there once, I don't think I'll visit it again. It is too dark, you can't really see the animals. Don't dream to take photos even with 10,000 ISO! Morning zoo is much better."
,,Safari Park After Dark,4.0,,"Wow, this was totally cool (Actually it was really hot). We had a great family outing here, it's a little way out but worth it."
,,Amazing experience - a must do in Singapore!,5.0,,"Make sure you do this when visiting Singapore, but be tactical about the order you do the activities in!

We booked the first slot (7:15), we had read about the crazy team queues and so decided to head straight to the walking route, which was dead empty & so much fun.

Don't bother with a camera, the lighting is too low & you may as well enjoy the experience and take it all in!

After we did the walking tour it was around 9pm, and the tram queue was empty. We managed to get on a team and there was 8 of us in total.

Overall we both loved it (as you may be able to tell), and would definitely recommend it!"
,,Best to book before it gets dark. 6.15pm or 7.15pm show usually the best,5.0,,"From the city centre it is about a half hour drive to get to the night safari. Once you Are in passed through the entrance best to queue straight away for the tram that will take you around with an automated recording tour guide. You will get to see the elephants, lions tigers and other animals and is entertaining for the kids especially. With the tram it will stop off at four points and you can hop on hop off at each of the spots. As you come out there are plenty of taxis to take you home. Check with your hotel and see if they do provide a complimentary shuttle bus that will take you there."
,,Children enjoyed it,4.0,,"Children will like it as they will see free animals without cage ! You can take a tram ride or a walking trail. It has a dense forest like environment.
Dont forget to watch the fire show which is without any charge.

Indian vegetarian wraps are available for the vegetarian visitors."
,,A worthwhile visit but don't show early,4.0,,"The Night Safari is a wonderful place to spend a few hours enjoying nature during the evening but do not go early if you do not have kids in tow. I recommend you show up about 10pm. You will have a good chance of skipping the lines.

Near the entrance you will get your tickets which was a very quick and efficient process. Shortly after that, just past the ticket booth they may have the fire breather show. A couple of young local men will come out in a animal skin and shoot flames all over the place. This is definitely a crowd-pleaser.

Once you make your way past this you may or may not have much of a line to wait in before you are allowed to begin a walking tour. I started off with the walking tour as it appeared if we saved the tram tour for later we would have even less lines to contend with.

There are several paths to follow but it is not difficult to plan your routes and catch all of the critters in their nocturnal habitats. Being a nocturnal attraction, there is very little light and picture taking is very difficult, particularly because they ask that you do not use flash. You will want a high res camera with the ability to adjust your settings up to and including night mode. Otherwise, you will have a difficult time getting many post worthy photos.

They have many critters and not just from the local areas. They have many from Africa as well. You see more of the larger African species when you take the tram with guided tour.

We made it to the end of the walking part of the tour back to the entrance and hopped in a much smaller line to enjoy the tram ride with guide tour. If we had waited just a bit longer the line would have been near nonexistent. As it was we had a few very unhappy kids who only wanted to be in bed by this hour.

Once finished with our tram ride it was back out of the park where we past through the restaurant, snack bar and souvenir area. The food does appear decent and of course the items for sale are all zoo based animal replicas.

Surprisingly, getting back to our hotel this late at night was not hard to do as they had plenty of taxis waiting outside but the traffic was still moderate but moving as we headed back into the city proper. I most certainly recommend the Night Safari as one of the must do items in Singapore."
,,One of a kind!!!,4.0,,"This is the first time I have done a night safari and the experience is very different. We took the tram ride and then walked all the trails. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Make sure you have a bottle of water with you as it still gets warm even if it is at night. Get there for about 18h00, have dinner (there was only one place that did halal food) and then go for the safari. All the staff are really helpful and welcoming. The animal show is a bit basic but still very entertaining."
,,Fun,3.0,,"It was a pleasnt experience with kids. Kids were very existed. Management is not upto the level of Singapore. Crowd management was poor. It was difficult to know what to first,what to do next."
,,Very good experience,4.0,,"Singapore Night Safari
Is a unique way to experience the wildlife , it's part of the Singapore wild life and has three parts

- tram ride - you can enjoy the ride and view the animals in their battalion habitat.
The attraction is the African elephant, Indian lion and the Malayan Tiger

Walk trails - you can get down at the team station and take a walk trail - it will give you and experience of walking in deep woods.

- wild life show - you get to see some animals in the amphi theatre.

If you are visiting Singapore this place is a must go."
,,Bit crowded but go for novelty value,4.0,,We managed to go during Chinese new year so had to wait in queues for almost 2.5 hours. But not seen anything like this and that too in natural habitat.
,,Unique in my experience,5.0,,"I've been to many fabulous zoos, but this was unique! We loved walking the trails and were surprised at the amount of animal activity easily viewable. The tram was also much better than expected. We didn't expect to see animals from the tram, but there they were!

As two adults, we were disappointed in Creatures of the Night and will skip this show on the next visit. Because the earlier shows had filled quickly, we queued for over 45 minutes for the 9:30 show. This was unnecessary as that show had seats available at the start. I wish we had spent extra time walking the trails rather than standing in queue. The show itself was clever and the presenter excellent, but had more jokes and gags than animal activity. If with children, this might provide a nice rest, but we regret not spending more time on the trails. The Fire Show was not running the evening we were there.

I was concerned about transportation for the return. There was no difficulty however. Many taxis arriving and leaving around 11 PM as we finished up.

The staff was great. I appreciated those manning the tram crossing and making sure visitors did not go astray. This is a definite return for next visit."
,,interesting take on a zoo experience,4.0,,fun to do once -- ride a tram through the animals' habitats..... other things to do there but we just went for the night safari.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The night safari is a brilliant way to see animals from a close distance without them being locked in small cages. The tram was a brilliant way to get around the park and see lots of the animals in a short space of time. Unfortunately we had bad luck with the day we went because there was a festival on and the safari was packed so missed out on bits of it but would definitely recommend!!
,,Amazing Time,5.0,,Great fun highly recommend world class good value for money. Enjoyed the tram car Safari the animals were up and close🐘🐅🐅
,,An evening I will never forget,5.0,,"I will never forget the midnight sarari which I went on during my stay in Singapore. Driving around in a golf buggy listening to the sounds (and smells) of the jungle at midnight is an experience which I will never forget. I remember turning a corner and on one side a mother and a baby elephant had literally just stepped out of the jungle and then unbelieveably the, I will call him The Daddy elephant, a huge beast stepped out from the other side and trumptted his arrival. Simply unforgettable."
,,Worth seeing!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this attraction. It was very atmospheric seeing the animals in natural settings at night. Whether it would have been quite the same had it been very busy - which we were told it can be during the high season - but by the time we got onto one of the safari buses to take us round we were the only ones on it, so there weren't lots of other people chatting or fidgeting. We also watched a ""show"" while we were there where one of the keepers introduced us to raccoons and otters etc. There is a food market at the site selling different kinds of cuisine so it is easy to make a night of it."
,,Zo zoo spezzul,5.0,,"See Singapore Zoo at night! All the nocturnal animals normally not on view during the day are tempted to their feeding points that are close to the night safari ride. The zoo also has great food and entertainment, it is a special zoo."
,,Amazing setup,5.0,,"All the animals here are fabulous. Lots to see and also good food. Many more animals than I expected , shuttle service is very good."
,,Not great if you have visited the Singapore Zoo,1.0,,"I had bought the 4 park ticket. So we visited this place after the zoo. I did not enjoy it much as amphitheatre show at the end of the safari was similar to Jurong bird theatre show and the night safari has the same animals which we saw in the zoo.

Tips for visitor:
1. They have a fire show in the beginning ( 30 minutes before the gate opens) which you can enjoy
2. You might have to assemble an hour before and occupy seats outside. You can grab some barbecued meat. I am a vegetarian so have less idea
3. If you have kids it may be nice to see the safari but for a family with teens I really doubt it.
4. If you skip it you won't miss any big experience."
,,Well managed Safari,4.0,,"A Well managed Safari.love the tram ride. Tram guide shared fascinating facts and tales about the animals and habitats along the journey.
Queue for the tram could be long, so reach on time.You can choose to walk first or to see the show with the animals and get on the tram later. However, I recommend to take the tram first and get a global picture, later you can decide which trail to walk on.
There are two free shows in night. And after the safari you can enjoy some good foods as well. I had Indian thali,that was good."
,,Human zoo more than an animal zoo,3.0,,"I really wanted to like this more than I did. We arrived at 8.15 on a weekday evening and there were hundreds of people lining up... the queue to get the trams was huge although it did move quite fast. The voiceover in the tram was loud and didn't stop talking the entire trip although it kept saying we had to be quiet to see the animals. Saw a few animals but many were asleep - so much for being nocturnal!

Later in the evening when many of the humans had gone we walked the trails again quietly and this was so much more enjoyable as we saw more animals and it was much more peaceful. Maybe the secret is to come late at night when there are less people."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"booked the tour through Viator which included hotel pick up. Did not book the buffet dinner this time as we didn't think it was value for money last time. Night show was interesting, but wouldn't bother again. Priority tram ride with tour and then an hour and a half to walk around the zoo. Great night, would do it a third time."
,,Great zoo,4.0,,One of the best zoo i've visited! They have so many other different types animals that aren't like the generic animals in usual zoos. The compound is large and the animals aren't kept in cages either which is excellent. I went at night for the night safari and we got to see plenty of animals (since most of them are nocturnal). The shows were also amazing (we even saw a wolf) and the animals seem well trained. The only downside is that the lines are extremely long so you'll probably have to wait for 30-45 minutes in line until you're at the front of the line.
,,An Evening to Enjoy,5.0,,"As we come from Dubai, United Arab Emirates the four hour difference in the time zone effected my 7yr old son more than I thought.
It was difficult getting him out of bed in the mornings and would end being cranky the whole day so to enjoy the holiday I decided to compromise and do things after lunch.
I usually do everything myself but but as the zoo was quiet far off from the hotel and the return was at night I opted to go with a tour company. We went with Tour East.
Got picked at the hotel, taken to China Town where they had a cashier kiosk. After the payment was made got put into a bus to go to the zoo.
The guide was funny and informative. Once we got there the guide went to get our tickets and we had a quick toilet rush. Facilities are very clean.
He handed us our tickets and got us into the tram for the safari.
After the safari we watched the "" Creatures of the Night "" , it was entertaining. Not any wow factor from the animals but fun to watch. This was approximately 20-25 mins and we left the amphitheater.
We were left to do the night trail, but my son was too tired and scared as it is pretty dark.
Saw a 2 min fire show--- it's nothing but a guy blowing fire --- seriously that's all it is but the children were impressed.
Had dinner which was obviously overpriced and this is norm for such places, no surprise here.
Definitely recommended.
Please be prepared for show cancellations as for Safety Reasons, shows and rides get canceled due to lightening threats."
,,Only if you are really interested in wild animals,3.0,,"A one of kind zoo, to watch animals in nocturnal environment. The lighting is simulated moon light, so that the nocturnal habits of the animals are unaltered. The number of animals and their variety is good.
Children can't enjoy much, as it is difficult to spot animals in low lit (moon) light. It takes an extra effort to detect animals. Flash photography is not permitted. Not the place, to get great animal photos or selfies."
,,Not as expected,3.0,,"The most enjoyable part about this safari is that it's done at night. The animals you see aren't that different to the ones in the main zoo.
It might have been the time we went, but the animals weren't any more active than during the day. I also noticed the animals were hiding in the shadows, trying to get away from the light the park had put over their enclosures.
The show they put on was also quite average, not much happened."
,,Safari with no barriers,4.0,,"The night walk between the open cages leaves you amazed. the fences can't be seen so you are standing in front of the Lions or hainas with only few meters between you. Moreover the coolness of the night allows the animals to wonder around and be active. With all that said, the price is not cheap, about 45sg$ for an adult."
,,Don't miss out the Night Safari at all!,5.0,,"Although you might have to wait a little bit because of the huge travelers' crowd, It is going to be an experience of a lifetime. We got to see Tiger and Lions openly, without any barricades in between. That was a wow moment for this trip. The foot walk is amazing, given it is night time and it's very quite all around. The management is quite good and you need not feel unsafe at all! The live animal show was very good experience as well. Unfortunately the fire show was cancelled due to heavy wind,but I have heard that's worth watching as well."
,,Just OK,4.0,,"Go during the day, Tough to see animals in the dark. Its not cheap, but nothing is in Singapore. Ride the tram to the parts you want to see. There are 2 shows at night in the zoo (free) go see them if you can."
,,great night,4.0,,"it took one hour to queue for tickests and tram ride. we have seen many animals,the animals all looked good,not like someone commented that the animals looked unhappy. visiting a zoo at night is really different.which makes it more thrill.my son enjoyed it a lot,even want to go again without tram ride(there are walking trails),it is a good place for kid to go."
,,Good,4.0,,This night safari in the controlled environment is different to other ones .A good safari ride for family and friends.Animals looks good.
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,Went on the night safari whilst visiting my daughter who has been twice before! It is a lovely experience and unusual to see animals at night. The only thing wrong was the idiots who are told not to use flash cameras but still do so!!!
,,Great Night Outing!,4.0,,"Be sure to come early for the 7:15 admission, so that you can cover the vast area, plenty of wild animals see."
,,Fabulous time!,5.0,,This is a must see attraction in Singapore. I would highly recommend the night safari!! We weren't going to bother with it as only had 2 days in Singapore but I am so glad we did go as it was amazing!
,,Overpriced and over rated,2.0,,"We visited during the Singapore 50th anniversary of independence and the night zoo was absolutely rammed. The locals were able to visit for free and they did! We queued for over 2 hours and then were whisked around the zoo in 35 minutes. I assume in
normal circumstances it's not as bad, but looking at animals in the dark didn't really float my boat."
,,Best zoo-visit ever,4.0,,"I've never done a night safari at a zoo before, so this was a fairly special experience for me. The lineup was VERY LONG, which ruined the atmosphere a bit. But all in all, I definitely this to couples and families."
,,Get close with Creatures of the Night,4.0,,"We started off the trip with an animal show the animals were really smart and there was some surprise in the middle of the show which was really cool.

The night tram ride was the best as you get to cruise around the zoo, it was cooling and at some points the tram will pass by deers, wild pigs and some other four legged friends wandering freely.

The bat enclosure was another highlight as bats were flying freely above you and across you. It was exhilarating to say the least.

With the other tracks, animals were really adorable doing about their own things probably thinking 'who are these people?'

Nice experience for a night time zoo trip overall but if you want to 'see' the animals going about in their daily activities and take pictures, you could perhaps go to the zoo in the day time when the sun is out."
,,Not as good as the Zoo,4.0,,"We went to the Zoo before heading to the Night Safari in the evening. While it wasn't bad, it probably didn't live up to the hype, and we found it really wasn't better than the zoo. A lot of the animals are not necessarily nocturnal, and so many were sleeping. A good experience, but make sure you don't miss the zoo!"
,,You can choose it as an optional tour,3.0,,It's very nice and well made. You really can't see the animals so clearly at night from the tramp. The tramp moves quite fast so you don't get much time to experience the site of the animals.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Amazing experience! I would recommend doing the cart ride around the safari first and then doing the walking trails- trails do not take too long and it is easy all flat. You see so much more doing the trails so do not skip this. Wonderful night.
,,Pretty good but crowded,4.0,,"Liked the tram trip but thought the creatures of the night show was disappointing, boring and not that great. The zoo is hilly but has some great exhibits. Fun to walk around at night."
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,"It was an awesome experience, primarily due to the novelty of the idea and the fact that we saw a lion up close for the first time."
,,Disappointed by the Hype,2.0,,Night Safari is good for kids or maybe families but definitely a no go for solo travellers. Had seen more animals in wild than here. Expensive and not worth a visit.
,,"A great experience, but crowded",4.0,,"Easy to get to via MRT and bus, but takes a long time and the bus from Ang Mo Kio gets very full. Far better to take a taxi or Uber. We arrived very late due to some transport difficulties and thankfully were given priority access so we didn't have to wait in the very long queue for the tram with young children.

It seems like a lot of people stick to the tram. Do yourself a favour and jump out for a walk. The kids loved spotting the animals although many of them weren't very active. The bats were a highlight for us because they were very active and you can get very close to them."
,,Better than expected and definitely worth it!,5.0,,"After reading so many negative reviews I was quite worried about the quality of the night safari. However, I did really enjoy it and I went by myself. This is a cross between a zoo and a safari (Do not expect it to be a full safari)
Don't focus on taking pictures as it is often too dark. Just enjoy it with your eyes. People with poorer eyesight may not enjoy it as much.
The highlight was the shuttle but do it much later when there are no lines. Do the walk trails first that is the secret! It will be much more enjoyable this way. Didn't expect to see animals roaming between the tracks and with no barriers (This is why I said it was a cross between a zoo and a safari).
Don't expect to see all the animals but I did see most.
Definitely worth a visit for people who have not experienced it."
,,Joke Safari,1.0,,"It was only half an hour ride by tram and very limited animals shown, the shows before and after are also quite average"
,,Great!,5.0,,We went at night on a tour here. Food was nice and fire show should not be missed. Great experience.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"If you got kids this is a must do. Lots of fun, a bit of thrills and very reasonable in cost. its a great attraction after an earlier dinner to get those kids tired."
,,Zoo at night...we expected more,2.0,,"We expected a spectacle but it’s nothing really special, besides the long queue.
Crowds of people everywhere, long lines and only few attractions. Our kids where little terrified when we had to wait in the masses of people before the gates opened.
Basically it’s nothing special, it’s just visiting the Zoo at Night. Go during the day and you will see more."
,,Must See,5.0,,"A unique experience that is well worth the 30 minute trip out of town to attend. We caught a taxi to and from the zoo, cost was about $S20 to $S30 per trip (depending on traffic and time of day)."
,,Throroughly worth it,5.0,,A unique concept and a very enjoyable one ! Its an excellent option to spend your evening and looking at animals.
,,Good evening tour with guide.,5.0,,Booked this as part of the package and the bus didn't fail to do a good job. Our Guide Kelly was larger than life and loud. The microphone broke on the bus but we could still hear her. She obviously loved the Singapore area and supplied a lot of facts and details.Best bit was the light show at the Gardens by the bay. This is in fact free but the bus dropped us off very near and Kelly advised on the best viewing locations.
,,Night Safari - must do!,5.0,,Night Safari is awesome - a must see! Definitely go with a tour - you get fast-tracked through to the Tram and avoid the queues. Great to see the animals at night and the buffet was good!
,,"""Lovely experience for all age groups""",4.0,,"I had visited Night Safari during the month of November, and have not got long queues any where. They have a few shows, which needs booking. On busy weekends its better to book entry tickets in advance. Tram rides needs a waiting of maximum 10 to 15 minutes. You can also choose to book it on spot. There are few walking trials inside the park, which are absolutely safe and very well maintained. Unfortunately, if you reach there very late in the evening, you may miss few things. Best time to go would be post afternoon, the weather will be pleasant and you would get lot of time to explore the entire safari."
,,Great tour to hang out at night with family,5.0,,We went to Night Safari for 42sgd per person and enjoyed the ride. Plus the price include animal.show which is very entertaining and the latter part make it worth the money. Went back to bras basah area with transfer service with only 5sgd.
,,Nice moonlight view of a zoo when it first startd,4.0,,Better to walk than to take the tram -better sensation of being in a jungle. Cannot compare to other night zoos because of land constraints. Hope the new plans will give this a fresh look. Good for first time visitors
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Go on an organised tour and your guide will make sure you get on the tram ride quickly, be there at the end of tour to offer options of walking tour or see an animal show and allow free time. It's a great and unusual experience. If you have only one night in Singapore, do this"
,,A concern,2.0,,"Very very busy. Long queues and loud unruly tourists running wild everywhere. The shuttle was extremely busy and a very loud engine which drowned out most of the tour broadcast.

The animals looked sad and many were walking in small circles with one banging its head against the glass. This is not a sign of hunger, as I was told, but rather a sign of a very stressed animal.

This is a shame on Singapore and should be reviewed against animal welfare measures."
,,Well Done and Fun for All Ages - But Time for an Update,4.0,,"This was my sixth trip to the Night Safari - going back almost a decade. I still love the novelty of going to a zoo at night - and seeing the animals in a different light (or lack thereof) compared to what you see during the day. That said - I think its time for the zoo to either expand a bit (particularly on the tram ride) - or maybe refresh the exhibits so that there is more to look forward to on repeat trips. That said - I think that the park is basically being run as a novelty type attraction - grab the tourists once - and no need to focus on the repeat customers.

On this trip - we arrived around 8:45 p.m. - and the lines were very long and slow to take the tram ride. In terms of loading the trams - they were very inconsistent. Some of the staff allowed parties of two to have their own bench seat on the tram - while in our case (and many others) we were overloaded on our seat (thanks to some extra large guests on our seat) and our knees and shoulders were crammed in to make sure we all remained in the tram. When it's steamy and hot - you don't want to be in this position!

The exhibits were great - although the Bengal tigers are looking very bored - and I suspect animal rights experts would say that they need more enrichment as the 15 minutes we were with the tigers all they did was pace back and forth in the same place in front of the glass window - which is far from normal behavior - even in a zoo environment. To make sure you see everything - including all aspects of what you see in the trolley - it is worth your time walking on the multiple paths. Not only do you see some great Asian animals you won't see in your home zoo - but you can get much closer to the animal enclosures on the tram path - and can notice much more of what's going on with the animals in the areas of the enclosures not visible on the tram.

As usual with all things Singapore - the park is clean, the staff were friendly, and while I think the cost is a bit high for the number of animals they are actually exhibiting, you are paying a premium for the night experience. It's definitely worth it for the first time Night Safari goer - a little less so for the repeat visitor."
,,It's not worth the money,3.0,,"We were with hight expectations but when you arrive there quickly see that is the same as go to a normal zoo but at night and with selected animals. There aren't any kind of emotion or animations extra.
Even the show is very weak and short.
We wouldn't came back or recommend it.
You have to be lucky to be able to see the animals because there's a big possibility that they a sleep or eating."
,,Not worth the money!,2.0,,Nothing you wouldn't see at the zoo during the day. Just plainer animals at night. I would skip the night safari and just do the Singapore zoo during the day.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,The night Safari is very good. There is a pre-entry show with fire blowing performers to make waiting in que to get in very entertaining. Only downside is that kids may start to get tired during the evening.
,,Better than anticipated!,5.0,,"After a couple of hours in the zoo, we went to dinner at the entrance plaza of the night safari, which is entirely separate from the zoo. It is well set out and prepared for the onslaught of people arriving at 5.30 when it opens.
When we entered at 7.15 we chose to go straight on the tram, which was 40 mins and had excellent views of most animals. In some cases feeling a little too close (I'm looking at you hyenas and lions!).
This area of the park is completely separate from the zoo, with different animals (some repeats) and a different layout. It is lovely to see the animals more awake and moving around freely.
We then did all 4 walking trails in an hour, which was interesting as you got to see different animals than from the tram.
We then got a more crowed bus back to the mrt and made it back to marina bay in an hour. An excellent evening out."
,,Very Dissapointed,2.0,,"My Husband and I were really excited about night zoo as have heard great reviews, but we walked away very dissapointed. We went on small tram around zoo didn't see many animals at all mainly deers and when attending the night show we were seated and had a huge hedge blocking the show so once again more disappointment. Overall we wouldn't advice this, but have been to the zoo in the day and thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,Totally different experience,5.0,,Its a very different and great experience to visit a zoo by night. The night safari opens at 7.15pm. I recommend to start with a ride with the safari tram. Nice intro and initial view of the animals from all continents. After the ride follow the trials and within 1.5hrs you are able to walk through the park. We ended the visit with a funny show.
,,Chaotic start but worked out ok.,4.0,,"We booked a night safari on high recommendations and expected it to be a quieter experience. 
We were booked on a 7:30 ticket and decided to arrive early at 7:10.
However we arrivedand were surprised to find a few thousand people queuing to get in. This looked like chaos ! It may be that people booked on the later tickets had all turned up early. 
The result being a massive crowd pushing to the trams . The staff appeared to be prepared for this and we were moved on to another area where we watched a live animal demonstration that lasted around 20 minutes.  The show was actually entertaining but did feature some trained animals which might offend a few  people.  In my view this isn't exploitation and we should bear in mind this zoo donates money to various animal aid and research projects around Asia.
So the show finished and we found ourselves back in a Disney land style queue for our tram which we finally boarded an hour after our ticketed time.
I hope this information is useful,  basically there's no point in getting here early and don't worry if you are late. It doesn't seem to matter to the zoo what time your ticket is booked for and it doesn't get checked.  As I say a bit chaotic really but all will work out in the end , but be prepared for some standing and waiting.  The tour around the zoo by tram , is wonderful and quite different to what you will see in the daytime. There are also 2 optional self guided walks.
 We actually did the day visit and a night safari but if you have limited time then we would suggest the night safari as it's a unique experience.  Bear in mind unless you have a night vision camera you won't be able to take photos!"
,,A great night out,5.0,,A great night out for the family and anyone who loves animals. The tram safari was excellent and the night trails a must. Tip-try to board the tram early. The animals are feed then and sightings are much more prevalent than later in the evening. The animal show was average and can be missed.
,,Just the best zoo experience,5.0,,"It's fun , it's impressive and it's heaps cooler than the day experience at Singapore zoo. There is food (variable - go for the local food ) there are options to walk or ride but the stars are the animals - very well done Singapore!"
,,great outing singapore zoo,5.0,,"do not miss the zoo and night safari on your singapore trip, go a bit later in evening when its cooler else u may not be able to visit the whole place, do not miss night safari, its a great experience, hats off to management, well maintained, v profesional, many things to learn from there"
,,Not a Great Experience,3.0,,"The idea and concept is good of seeing the wild animals in the open at night time but it can be avoided as you get to see more of deers, cattle and elephants. If you are lucky you can see a lion and fox. If you have energy to walk then better take the Walk Trail rather than the Tram ride. Book the first show of 19.15 hours to enjoy more time inside. The show at the amphi theatre is also not so good so you can save around 20 minutes."
,,Awesome zoo experience,5.0,,you get to walk around the zoo at night. and its nice to see animals not in cages. the train ride around the place is really cool too. i've done this twice and enjoyed it equally both times.
,,Definitely worth going!,5.0,,"There are 4 different times and we opted for the earliest (7:30 start) which was good as we got to see and do more and ended up not leaving until past 10pm. We arrived before 7pm (mistimed, not on purpose) and there were a lot of ppl there already. There's no point actually queuing early as once inside, you still have to queue for the safari tour if you want to do it right away. About 15 mins before the door opens, there is a side show with some flame-tossing which is quite neat (but you can also catch that on your way out).

We lined up for the safari tour which took around 30mins wait-time And the tour itself was around 30 mins , then had some food near the entrance (highly recommend the Korean Galbi beef rib set!) and then went back in for the walking tour, rejoining the safari tram at station 3 for the second time.

In future, we would probably start with the walking tour which is to the left of the tram line (fishing cat and leopard tour) for a more leisurely start and then catch the safari ride at Train Station 3 mid-way and then do the rest via tram. This would definitely save some time and would be less tiring, esp with young children."
,,Night safari- Not quite what I expected,3.0,,Found the Night Safari disappointing. The pre Safari entertainment was amateurish and aimed at children. The queues to access the safari coaches were chaotic and muddled. The Safari itself was basically a tour round a zoo with the lights turned down. Go in the daylight you will see the animals more clearly! I had looked forward to this greatly but found it somewhat lacking.
,,Too congested on Saturday,3.0,,"We went to Night Safari after going to Singapore Zoo last Saturday. It opens at 7:30p.m. and allows visitors to enter by hourly sessions from 7:15p.m. When I arrived at the ticketing counter at about 6:20p.m. , the tickets for the first session were sold out. I could only choose the second one. After dinner, we found the visitors had already queued for the second session of 8:15p.m. about half an hour before. We did so but could only enter it at about 8:30p.m. when the show was full. We hurried to the tram stop and had waited for another hour for the tram tour. After that, we could just get the last session of show at 10:30p.m. The M.C. for the show is excellent but the show itself is not quite special."
,,Fun and educational,5.0,,"Another recommendation of my sister's, and another spot on the money as far as I am concerned. The Night Safari was a lot of fun. I took the 7:15pm show, starting off with the animals of the night show, this was a simple but cute show of various creatures performing a few tasks, including teaching us the importance of recycling of rubbish.

It was the tram ride that I truly enjoyed, this went for a decent length of time and was very informative. During the ride I discovered a number of creatures like the lion and rhinoceros that I had thought were exclusively African also existed in Asia, though sadly were endangered. I didn't want my tram ride to end I was enjoying it so much. If you intend to take the tram and are on a tour be aware it's popular and times to get onboard can be long.

Unfortunately windy conditions prevented the other show the park runs for running on the night I was there, it looked amazing from their flyer, so a pity to have missed.

Don't miss this if you visit Singapore, I'm glad it was recommended to me."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,We had an amazing experience during Night Safari. We took the tram than doing the walk trail. The audio guidance was explaining every thing very well.
,,Great for family!,5.0,,"Do it if you like to be safe and have fun. A little too dark but maybe I was getting, too old! Amazing animals like the Tiger :)"
,,Fun,5.0,,Nice way to see creatures of the night in their habitat. Remember: NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY. Some visitors seem to forget this.
,,Could see most of the animals from the tram,5.0,,"Was surprised that we could see most of the animals from the tram ride. When I last went a few years back, a lot of animals were already tugged in, which was disappointing. We also took the Wallaby trail after getting off the tram. Signs for the trails were a little confusing so having a map with you would be helpful. For the ""Creatures of the night"" show, it'd be good to be seated a good 20 minutes before the show. It was very crowded the night we went and spent a good amount of time queueing for entry and for the tram ride. If you happen to be at the outside courtyard at 9pm or 10pm, you can catch a fire-breathing show there. We caught that show while in the queue to enter."
,,Nice but crowded,3.0,,"We went on the night safari after spending the day at the zoo. It was very crowded and long lines. You have to go for a timed entry but, 1000 plus people have the same time. It was breezy so they cancelled the fire show. We went for a nice bird show and then stood in line for a tram. We waited about 20 minutes and then we were on the tram which was nice after walking all day. Most of the animals were visible but it was like seeing them at dusk. Commentary was interesting. A little pricey compared to the whole days entertainment at the zoo. If you have to pick one, the zoo would be my choice. We almost just did the safari and we would have missed out. I think these are in 2 different areas. If money is not an issue, do both."
,,Great concept,5.0,,This is something unique. One of the must do things in Singapore. Usually you only get to see captive animals during the day so this concept is pretty unique and thoroughly enjoyable.
,,Walk till we dropped,5.0,,We tackled River Safari for several hours during the afternoon and stayed on to experience Night Safari. Glad we did. Well done and the tracks to experience the night life is fantastic
,,Really cool zoo,4.0,,Arrived with 2.5 year old in Singapore and friend took us to the night zoo. As we were still jetlagged the timing was great as she would have otherwise slept throughout the safari. The only negative thing was the wait in the humidity for about one hour. Do not go before chinese new year or on a saturday night ;)
,,Whole new experience,4.0,,"Went during the Easter weekend at 9.15pm and it was unsurprisingly packed. Good thing is the park uses timed entries (once every hour).

Prior to the entry there is also entertainment available outside the park - there was a fire eating show at 9pm.

Upon first entry the queue to the tram ride was unbelievably long. However a good idea is to go through the walking trail first - it takes about an hour to get through and at the end the crowd should clear for the tram ride. Not sure if this will apply for earlier entries. Skipping the tram ride entirely might not be a good idea since the route that the tram takes is not accessible via foot.

However, the trade-off is that entering late will mean missing most of the shows - the Creatures of the Night's last show is 9.30pm, and there are limited seats. Lion and tiger feedings also end by then.

The park offers a good range of animals, and seeing them in the dark is a whole different experience. It's still bright enough to take photos, but please do not use flash photography.

The tram ride experience is a lot more up close and intimate. There were animal exhibits on both sides with an English audio commentary playing overhead. We even saw the buffalo sleeping on the grass patch right next to the road! The tram also stopped for when the animals crossed the road, which was quite a sight.

Perhaps the only thing that may spoil your visit is the tourists themselves. Do wear comfortable walking shoes as the park is quite big and spaced out."
,,"Creatures of The Night Show - Long Wait, Short Program, No Meat",2.0,,"Waited about 40 mins for the creatures of the night show to get in and start. Amphitheater was not sufficient to accommodate so many visitors and some had to stand behind. Worst still, the compere or host took up about 3.5 mins to tell visitors not to use flash in different languages, leaving only about 16.5 mins for the show proper. Content was very lacking in substance and originality. Same old routine of getting a child volunteer to hold a piece of food for animals which virtually all zoos or similar places also do. Next was the boring routine of putting a snake around the neck of another volunteer and make him do a macho man pose. This procedure is repeated in so many zoos (not sure who is copying who). Getting the otters next to pick and throw objects into bins is highly similar to what they do during the day zoos around the world.

Waste of time to queue so long and see so little, much of what was shown was uncreative and stale. Will not bother to come again."
,,Get the feel at night,5.0,,Long queue at entrance.Tribal fire dance at entrance so if u r not early you have to crane your neck to see it.Opens at 7pm and all rush for the ride cars.Gives an effect of night in forest.Since we had time and it was not much rush so we took the rides two times and my kid was more than happy.lucky if you see the lion roaring.
,,Kids really loved it,4.0,,"The tram ride was real fun and you get to see many animals. The queues are very long, though. The show is no more than nice ..."
,,Excellent evening's entertainment,4.0,,"We went on an organised night tour which included dinner. On arrival we had our buffet meal with a selection of Chinese and local dishes which was excellent. We then went on a 45 minute tram ride through the zoo where they have highlighted areas where the animals come out at night to forage. It's all lit by moonlight so you can see clearly without disturbing the animals. What animals you see is down to luck but most are visible.These tram rides are very popular and best pre booked or you could have a long wait. The tour companies have specific times and trams allocated to them.
There are several walking trails of various lengths to see smaller nocturnal animals. We only had a short time and did one of the shorter trails but managed to see plenty animals.
Our trip ended with an 'animals of the night' show. This was enjoyable but concentrated too much on showmanship rather than showing the animals. It was more aimed at promoting environmental issues.
An excellent evening's entertainment with a good meal. Recommended."
,,Interesting experience,4.0,,My first night safari experience and the kids loved it. Going at night beats the heat too and everything seems different in the dark. Good try
,,Great attraction in singapore,5.0,,I was surprised at how the zoo comes to life at night. It was an easy taxi ride to the zoo and even better on the return trip to the city. Highly recommend for young families if you can keep them awake!
,,Night Zoo,3.0,,Was a different experience going on the tram too see the animals at night. Some animals are not seen clearly because of the lighting. We can see some animals very near to you. Not flash photography allowed.
,,Expected to see more,3.0,,Went on Easter weekend so expected it to be busy Booked tickets for 19:15 but didn't get on tram till 19:40 Waiting area before going in through turn stiles was chaotic Need to create lanes leading up to turn stiles Some foreign visitors were just inconsiderate of families with little children Ride wasn't 40 minutes as they had announced Lighting was poor Alcoholic drinks were overpriced Half litre of beer was SGD 13:50!!!!
,,Well designed park,4.0,,A park that you can get to the closest of some animals that are so tame you can never imagine. A walk through will give you an insight of many nocturnal animals which habits you won't believe
,,New Experience,4.0,,Went on the night safari during my last trip to Singapore. It was a new experience to see animals in their natural habitat and to see how they behave at night. We had to stay stand in the queue for a long time since there were only few staff at the counter to sell tickets. We missed the first safari trip but were able to make it to the 8.15PM. The place gets crowded really quickly so get there early. The first safari is at 7.15 PM. We went on the tram and later took the trails. Since its no flash photography don't waste your time to adjust your cam to take pictures. Enjoy the ride and the animals that you see.
,,Premium safari adventurer tour - a memorable experience!,5.0,,"We decided to splash out and booked the Premium safari adventurer tour after reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor about the Night Safari being quite busy with poor views of the animals.

The Premium safari adventurer tour was excellent - highly recommend to adults with or without children! We checked into the zoo at 6:15pm and had about an hour to enjoy a buffet in the Ulu Ulu restaurant. From there, we met our friendly and very knowledgable guide. We were taken to reserved seats in the nightly show (Creatures of the night), and then enjoyed 2.5 hours on a private tour with our guide. I think this tour can have maximum 8 guests. Our guide was excellent at pointing out the hard-to-see nocturnal animals and explaining information about them, that we never would have got on our own. A highlight of the evening was being able to feed the three female elephants!

As an aside, the zoo is about 25 km from the main part of Singapore and would take a while to get to on public transport - we took an Uber each way."
,,Brilliant.,5.0,,Such an adventure. Great way to deal with jet lag. Thank You. Don't miss it. Especially the tram and the walks in the dark. Brilliant.
,,Strongly depends on expectations,2.0,,"Sweet idea and always well booked, yet not my cup of tea. While very many animals are active at night, and hence this might be a great option, you really need to come early to avoid long queue time. Easy to get there, but a long ride in taxi or public transport, etc.
As said, if you have kids, might be worth it, but nothing that exited me much,"
,,Great experience & saw lots of animals!,5.0,,"We weren't sure what to expect, and we had to queue in hot & humid conditions, but felt it was well worth it as we saw lots of animals at quite close quarters- bears, elephants, lions, a tiger, hyenas, wild pigs, hippos, rhinos, lots of types of deer, and tapiers amongst others. Really enjoyed it - it felt magical in the moonlight."
,,The only Night Safari,4.0,,"This probably is the only night safari in the world. It was an amazing experience to watch so many animals up close (including wild animals like Tiger and Lion). Also, one need not walk if they cant, and can hop on to a road tram and take a trip of the Safari."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"Had a tour of the night safari on the tram, amazing to see all these animals so close up & no apparent barriers, also did the wallabies trail & show & was very impressed with the whole night safari experience"
,,First time in Night Safari,5.0,,Had never been to a safari or zoo at night time. What a lovely place to visit. A must visit when in singapore
,,Loved seeing the animals at night,5.0,,We did this trip with our 3 year old and it was a great experience. We did the Creatures of the Night show and did a trip on the tram (which is about 40mins) and found this was enough for us. There were walking tracks to do but we though what we did was enough with a small child. All of the animals were visible and it was a lovely atmosphere even though there were hundreds of people visiting.
,,Great night zoo..,4.0,,"Visited night safari during Chinese new year..
The queues for trams were large and took 40 45 mins to get tram. I being solo got a tram quickly..
Concept nocturnal zoo is great.. Various animals in their nightly glory..
I did only tram ride.. However walking trails are recommended.. To see more upclose experience..
Watch the fire show.. And had a decent burger at bongos."
,,It a experience if you like nature,3.0,,"It a good experience for tourist if you love nature. Can see the different type of night animal that moving and hunting for food at night. But do bring a small fan, as it will be quite hot when you visit at peak hour."
,,Excellent place to spend a day and an evening,5.0,,"This is a full day excursion. There are a lot of different animals and shows to see in the zoo. An awesome place for budding photographers. I particularly love the sea lion show!

Night safari is just next door. River Safari and Night safari are a must see."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,We tried the Night Safari and were very pleased. Such a unique opportunity to see animals walking free and so close. We ride on trams throughout the zoo. All of the workers were very friendly and really seemed to enjoy their jobs.
,,Night safari.,5.0,,Really good. The animals almost run free! The night safari is great. We arrived for the 7:15 pm safari and it was packed. If we did it again we would arrive for 8:15 or 9:15 pm.
,,Overated!,2.0,,"The night safari was a total let down.

May sound stupid but a little bit more lighting wouldn't go astray as some of the enclosures were really hard to see the animals that were out and about. Best bet would be the normal daytime zoo.
Take night vision goggles for the best look"
,,A little disappointing.,3.0,,Visited the night safari with family as was very excited but the overall experience was a little disappointing as most animals were either sleeping or in hiding. The lighting was too low to experience anything. Instead go in the day time and visit the Zoo.
,,Good for first time but not worth a repeat,3.0,,"this is more of an experience -- a fake jungle visit -- than a zoo visit.
first time watch still worth it but really if you want to go to see animals, then better to go during day.
try to book this with other park visit as a package.. that is the cheapest way to book it.
don't miss the fire show in the outside area.. its really amazing..."
,,Good nights entertainment,4.0,,"Wasn't sure what to expect with this, but glad we did it. You get up close to a lot of animals and there are many that I had never seen before"
,,Mixed Reviews,3.0,,"I was able to go to Singapore Zoo during the Christmas holidays. I had mixed emotions about it. The queues were horrifically long for the night safari experience. People were trying to cut queue, sell dodgy tickets in queue and then it's was a bit of a scary experience.

Animals were trying to run towards the car etc..

It seemed like a lot of work for the outcome. And it was about $100 for 2 people. Overall, I wasn't that impressed. Just followed the crowd as it's a popular destination.

PS. if you go to the night safari, depending on where you are staying the MRT may be closed down by then. We had to catch a taxi as it was too late..."
,,This is the best zoo I've ever been to,5.0,,"I've come back to the Night Safari multiple times - each time a friend visits Singapore, we always take them here. It's amazing. Personal favorites are the fishing cats and the slow loris's. A little expensive, but worth it.

Try and watch the show if you can. I also recommend taking walking about half way and taking the tram from the mid-way point back down."
,,This was so bad...,1.0,,"I don't know if it's because I'm a British tourist but I found this terrible and really unorganised not to mention incredibly cringe-worthy and commercial. For me it was uneasy watching animals being used for tricks and having tourists running and shouting about.
The actual show that is put on was one of the cheesiest things I have ever seen (I'm looking for my 'mr macho man') and various animal paraded in front of shouting kids. Not for me so left early."
,,Waste of time and money,1.0,,"Don't waste your time! Hardly saw any animals. Walking trails were not well lit, not well signed, and slippery in spots. Very disorganized at loading trams! Overall a big waste of time!"
,,WIld animals In Night,5.0,,Excellent to see. But Expensive you can bargain to the tour operators for the price. Around 45 Minutes of walk thru the Jungle and 30 Min in a TRAM. We can see a lots of Wild Animals.
,,Waste of money!,2.0,,We were extremely disappointed with the night safari. We couldn't see any animals due to lack of light (yes it was night time but nothing was lit up) and when there was an animal to be seen it was on the other side of the buggy. When there is 4 people to a row and 2 people are blocking your view well it leaves a little bit to the imagination. I personally wouldn't recommend it and probably a waste of money for the kids. I will say that the live animal show was amazing though so we didn't walk away completely disappointed!
,,Awesome concept with lovely indian food,5.0,,Visited the place with my 2 year kid. Lovely concept and found best indian food in Singapore. Want to visit the place once again in future.
,,Best way to see some amazing animals,5.0,,Very informative and the care for the animals is very evident. The team through the zoo at night is a great way to see animals that would otherwise be sleeping during the day. And i love the no fence enclosures!
,,A good thing to do,4.0,,Never been on a night Safari before this was good fun we booked a tour that included dinner at the zoo and was ok for mass catering
,,Night Safari - Give it a miss and do something else,1.0,,"If you are a local or a tourist wanting to find something to do at night, I would suggest doing something else rather than visiting the Night Safari. The staff members' customer service leave much to be desired and most of them seemed disinterested and are merely going through the motion. For the well-being of the animals, bright lights are discouraged, but it seemed to apply not only to strong camera flashes but even most of the pathways and stairs within the Night Safari. Do not expect to see all the animals since it will be quite dark. I am not sure whether the trams used diesel but there was a strong exhaust smell near the trams and the tram stations. If you love animals, I would truly suggest going to the Zoo in the day-time instead."
,,A Fantastic Zoo,5.0,,"Went as a family of 5 (3 children 13, 11, 11). Had a great time over a 4 hour visit. Walking around was great, Creatures of the Night show excellent and entertaining and tram ride superb. A real combination of a great zoo with a great safari park - up close to most of the animals.

All in all, brilliant and very well organised with friendly staff."
,,Great venue,5.0,,"Great visit, many animals in the night!! Great adventure. Combine it with the Singapore zoo visit. Have visited many times. Not to be missed"
,,Disappointed night,1.0,,"The zoo was well organized in their animal section, tram ride,activity and etc. The thing that made traveller feel not worth which is place are too dark, and the tourist are not allowed to snap photo. What we had seen was just the grass, rock (it is too dark to see an animal sometime) and the tram are riding too fast at certain section. It is not worth to spend money at night safari as i rather spend it in Singapore Zoo which is much better than this."
,,A MUST DO everytime you go to Singapore,5.0,,Such a unique experience getting to see nocturnal animals wandering around. Temperatures are cooler than the day time so it is a bit more comfortable for the humans as well- you sit in wee passenger buggys and get quietly driven aorund
,,Night Safari- Not as good as I thought it would be,3.0,,We had been looking forward to this. We were taken from the City by coach to the zoo. The safari drive is timed so you either go on the first Safari or the second one. The pre Safari animal show was tame and amateur. The Safari itself was basically a drive round parts of a zoo in the dark. I am not sure what I had expected but I came away disappointed.
,,Well Organised...,3.0,,"I think if you've got children then it's going to be great fun, but for tourists or adults living in Singapore... I'm not so sure it's worth the ride all the way there... It's well Organised and managed, as you would expect in Singapore. Essentially it's a zoo, in the dark..."
,,Night safari Singapore,2.0,,"Do not waste your time or money at this place. Very expensive not allowed to take photos of animals while on the tram ride, total disappointment.😞😞"
,,Well worth the crazy queues !,4.0,,"The ride was fabulous, the experience unsurpassed ! Seeing those animals free (except for the tiger that was behind a glass screen) was a highlight of our stay. The ride was comfortable and the explanation ample as we toured. We had purchased the tickets earlier on in the day yet still had to queue up for 2 hours to enter through the main gate. Personnel were not very friendly either; it seems they are overwhelmed by the numbers flocking in. Another 2 hours of suffering was yet to begin to access the night ride station after the entrance gate. I would suggest that there be a daily limit for admission into the park as the wait and the unbelievable crowd made it difficult to breathe let alone to enjoy. We could not leave the queue to purchase a bottle of water for my younger one to drink. Stock up on water and snack in preparation if you intend to go during the holidays. We arrived at 7 sharp and boarded for the ride at 11. There's a nice nocturnal animal show inside that is also not to be missed.
I would give a fabulous rating for the ride and show but the organization detracts from it all."
,,Good to take children - bring mosquito repellents,3.0,,"It is not as good as the Night Safari in Chiangmai, Thailand where there are lots more animals and they roam around so you can see them closer in action. The Singapore one is a lot more expensive and smaller. The ride feels so much faster. We took nephews who come visit from the US and they were bitten by mosquitos. So to parents, please spray excessively on their legs and ankles to prevent the nasty bites.
The shows including the breathe fire sticks were great. Kids enjoyed it."
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"Too many people crammed like sardines into too many trains, trains travelling so fast that it was impossible to see the wildlife properly. Long queues to see other shows. Very expensive foods and drink, eg nearly $10 for an ice cream. The whole venture appears to be set up to generate revenue."
,,"One of the best zoos in the world, a must while in Singapore!",5.0,,"A great experience for all ages and a must do while in Singapore. A beautiful, tranquil setting to observe nocturnal animals in a semi natural habitat. And the zoo is so much better at night in Singapore also because it's cooler and less humid! Love the fishing cat and bat exhibits... And if you don't care to walk, take the tram where you'll also see plenty of the wildlife."
,,Good experience,4.0,,Creatures of the night completely avoidable. Otherwise good experience. Children enjoy. Tram rides get crowded. Go only if its not raining.
,,Different experience of a Zoo,4.0,,The concept of night safari is quite a distinct experience as compared to a normal zoo walk. It is well maintained and offers most favourite animals of globe. Dont miss the Lion feeding sessions and animal shows.
,,Night Safari of Singapore Zoo,3.0,,"It's nice trip to view animals at night. We take the tram of 40 people for arround 40 minutes. We also can take the private tram of 7 people by the extra cost, by the flexible route as we want.
We also can take trip in the zoo by walk, just watch the animals surround you

To get to singapore zoo, we can only take taxi or bus.
Ther's no MRT close the area"
,,A different experience!!,4.0,,"I would recommend night safari over Singapore zoo.Singapore zoo is well maintained and good,but if you have been to couple of zoos around the world,then Singapore zoo isn't a must go.But a night safari option,and a chance to watch the animals at night,we won't be doing it that often,and that makes it a different experience all together.The 7.15 pm slot is the most crowded.If you go for 7.15pm,first opt for creatures of the night show,and then the tram.or else queue to tram would be too long in the beginning.After the initial crowd,the safari is less crowded past 8pm."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"This was the first time I had been to such a safari.
Its nice that they take us in a tram around the park.
There is commentary in the van about the animals.
Its wonderful to see the animals up close.
It would have been better to the guests to remain quiet for the safari to enjoy it more.
There were so many people talking incessantly spoiling the mood.
I loved the rainforest theme displayed n also seeing the Malaysian Tapir which I had never seen in my life.
Give the creatures of the night a miss. Only family of kids can enjoy that show as it seemed a bit juvenile."
,,Last stop before home,4.0,,"The Singapore Zoo Night Safari is a good trip to go on, it's good value except for the trip that includes the buffet dinner, I felt this was perhaps a bit expensive but that maybe because the buffet dinner was mainly Indian food, which is not my favourite buffet food. The animal experience at the zoo is as good as any other zoo."
,,Lots of peole,3.0,,"Was glad when it was time to leave. My mistake was doing both the River Safari and Night Safari in the same day. I was sick of walking around looking at animals. Couldn't hear the commentary on the Tram because people don't shut up. It was packed with people and being gates don't open till 715, you can't escape the crowds. However, the park is well maintained, plenty of staff, good enclosures. Just not my idea of a great time. May have been a better experience if I just did the night safari. Easy train/bus transport that's set up well for tourist."
,,Nice Experience,4.0,,A nice and different experience . Very close encounter with the nocturnal animals . You need to have a very high end camera and real skill to click pictures .
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"There are few chances to get close to nocturnal animals and this is one of the best of them in the world. Do it, you won't be disappointed."
,,Day and/or night for children mostly,4.0,,"This zoo is not the biggest I have been to, but the cages being a bit on the smaller side give you a lot more chance of seeing some of the critters up fairly close, Zoos do not please everyone but being able to see the nocturnal animals in their normal time of appearance is something that the children learn about as being new to them. Patrons can pay for the double day and night ticketing I have not heard of anyone being disappointed doing just that. Enjoy the activity especiallynif you have youngsters with you REM"
,,Wonderful Setting,4.0,,"Lovely setting, excellent idea. I wouldn't go with a guide party but rather on your own that way you can fully explore the park and the many walks and experiences it has to offer."
,,Underwhelming esp for Indians,3.0,,"Read a lot about this attraction and travelled quite a distance to get here. The way it is designed is a combination of zoo and walking trails. You get on a tram that takes you through various showcasing of selected wild animals like elephant, Tiger, lion etc. It was pleasant enough. However, being the night safari and low lighting for animals, spotting animals was quite difficult. Also most of the herd were Indian species - cows, buffaloes, Tiger etc that I had seen before.

The walking trails are good but not on the days it rains. Then it becomes damp and no animals are visible.

The creatures of the night show is rated as excellent. It's absolutely avoidable. Not only it's making joker out of animals forcefully performing for humans, it disregards it's own rules of harsh lights and loud music."
,,Educate yourself other ways people,1.0,,"Having spent a week at The Elephant Nature Park last year, has made us even more aware of animal welfare. Especially elephant needs & behaviours. The male elephant was repetitively rocking. A classic sign of a very unhappy elephant. I did not want to do the safari but was with my sibling family & felt obliged to be with them. I was distressed when I saw their male elephant. Please educate yourself. Elephants spirits are broken using torture & deprivation to be on show & ridden. They are not animals to be confined in very small spaces for humans to gawk at. The show was disappointing. Yes they educated the public but again animals were 'trained' to do human behaviours. It was pretty slow & lots of people walked out throughout the show. Not sure what people are raving about."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Visited with my wife. Ambience was nice however it was nothing special to me as zoo. Food and drink there was expensive. If you have time, please visit"
,,Do the night zoo experience,5.0,,We only visited the zoo of a night...It was fantastic. The zoo really comes to life after dark with all of the nocturnal creatures coming out. Great experience for both adults and children.
,,Unique to Singapore - must visit at least once.,3.0,,"Okay you have to do this at least once in Singapore. It is a coach trip to the zoo at night. Expensive, early start, food extremely expensive but good evening out. We ate early - good job or the food bill would have eaten a huge chunk out of our wallets ($13.50 for a glass of tiger beer, $6.50 for one scoop of ice-cream). The attraction is an animal show (average at best), a tram ride through the park (good) and a fire eater (gimmicky). You are then free to discover the park on your own (the best part and it's free !!). Be careful as it is a long walk all around and it is easy to go too far. The animals are in simulated natural habitat (only the tigers were behind glass screens the other animals are in the open). Very well maintained and worth a visit (but don't think we will be back)."
,,"Amazing, must do",4.0,,"This is where you get to see all the big animals, elephants, rhinos, hipos, lions, just amazing. The only downside was the tourists continued using their camera flash, even tho instructed not too."
,,Midnight Safari,5.0,,"Fantastic place to visit, make the midnight safari a must.
We arrived at 9pm. had a great time in the zoo interacting with the animals.
We then had a meal at the open air restaurant, the food was lovely and fresh.
At midnight we boarded the train and was taken through the forest enclosure to have close encounters with the nocturnal animals, including the lions.
I would advise you book your tickets before your visit to prevent disappointment if they are busy."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,Before going for night safari we had gone to Singapore zoo n were lil disappointed n bored but night safari was a very unique thing which we got to experience. Go for it if you are in Singapore
,,Pleasant enough but different evening out,3.0,,"Nice enough evening out, was a bit disappointed that saw very little of animals the little 'trains' have to keep going round and round. The little show was interesting. Clearly designed to maximise profits all felt a little like being herded ourselves"
,,Night Safari beats out the internet,5.0,,"If you have teenagers like me, finding alternates to the Internet is a real challange. Despite the initial moans and groans, my teens reluctantly agreed to a family outing to the Singapore Zoo.
For a twist we decided to go at night for the much acclaimed Night Safari.
A very good choice. What a difference the night experience made! Very cool vibe, night lighting makes it seem surreal. And the animals are more active than during daylight hours. Cafes open in zoo. We capped off the night at Ben and Jerry's Ice cream.
No complaints and even some reluctant teen 'thumbs up'
Want do to something different from watching tv or catching a movie after dinner, get out to the Zoo."
,,Enjoyed this,3.0,,This was interesting and worth doing for a change. Drive yourself if you can though as getting a taxi home is a nightmare with really long queues.
,,Fun for all ages,5.0,,"I took the walking route, and boy, I was blown away by the night time experience in the wild. You do get a tram service that will take you around, but I would highly recommend taking the walking trail as well (you mix both) . If you have older companions or infants you will get a wheelchair/stroller. It is best to use that for them because there are ups and downs in the walking trail. You might feel a bit tired pushing the pram/wheelchair."
,,Too staged,1.0,,"Maybe I am jaded as I have been on real safaris but the prerecorded guide says as you round this corner, you will see....and there the animal would be. It all seemed staged"
,,It's ok...,3.0,,"We decided to go to the night safari because we had heard good things but unfortunately it was pretty disappointing. We done the tram ride and most of the animals were asleep and it is pretty dark so you struggle to see much. There's nothing different here that you cant see in the zoo and at least at the zoo you can go in the day time so you can see a lot more. On the tram ride we mostly see deers, nothing to exciting. It's pretty straight forward to get here by public transport, it's worth doing rather then getting a taxi."
,,Good fun,5.0,,Great to see the animals in their nocturnal state Buy a express entry to avoid queuing it's only 10 dollars each extra but worth it
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"You can combine visit to zoo flowed by night safari and spend whole day there. They present a cultural show next to the entrance gate. This starts around 6.45 and if you want to view this properly you need to be present there well in time considering time for buying tickets. You may get seated at a burger place with a glass of beer and enjoy this show leisurely.

The night safari is an unique experience where you move in a tram and animals are in open. Presentation is awesome. You can take a walking trail instead of moving in tram if you want spend more and closer time with nature and animals. You may have to visit the place two times in case you want to take tram on one day and take walk on another."
,,Must visit - great for all ages!,5.0,,"The iconic Night Safari is a must visit when in Singapore. It opens at 7pm and can get crowded on weekends. The tram ride is fantastic but the trails are where the action is! Catch nocturnal animals including huge predators here. I especially loved the fishing cats - they were a treat to watch!
The entire attraction takes 2-4 hours to complete."
,,Night safari . Nice experiance ...,5.0,,We were six pax including 4 senior citizen visited night safari on 2nd march 2016. Dont miss tumbakar show @6:45. Its for 15 minutes.. must watch list... try to reach night safari early to get tram ride.. people stood in lines as early as possible to visit animals in little early evening time. So the vision will be better.. creatures of night show is also not to miss.. @8.00 o'clock.. very convenient for senior citizens.. wheel chairs also accessible easily.. we took bus from united square. We needed to change three buses.. googled over the map.. loved the place... better to take sentosa express buses from night safari to reach home.. food also available.. for vegetarian people it is little hard to find pure veg restaurant.. we took some food with us and had it out side night safari.. before visiting night safari we had been to river safari.. really awesome.. atmosphere was also nice.. try to keep sunsceen lotion with you all the time with some tang and glucose powder if you are with senior citizens..
,,Great fun at midnight,4.0,,"At first I didnt realize how late this place opens, i thought the zoo closed at 10 or 11pm. But I was surprised to be very late at night walking through the zoo and watching the animals. It was a great experience. Definitely take a taxi instead of waiting for public transport."
,,Ok experiance,3.0,,"This review is going to be just a lot of tips as i think we could have enjoyed it more if we had done it differently.
Firstly go during the week as it is less crowded.
No need to arrive early. Its open until late. Once the first rush has passed at 7.30 with people queing from around 6.45 it is much quiter. I would suggest going at 8pm or after.
Take the tram ride around the park and the ranger tells you all about the animals. This is a 40 min journey. I would then do the walk through the parts that you dont see from the tram. You can also spend time looking at some of the animals for a longer period.
I personally didnt think the animal show was worth the effort. It was very hot and uncomfortable and a good part of the show was telling people not to use flash cameras. This of course was totally ignored by quite a few people.
The food was very nice but very expensive. If you dont eat before you go then i suggest you have your meal before you do the walking trails. Its much more atmospheric after dark."
,,Night Safari- Singapore,5.0,,We loved night safari. The show was entertaining- the tram ride was fun- there were lots of different animals. We also loved the fire show at the end
,,Nice Experience!,4.0,,"Night Safari is a good Experience , but not superb !! OK typo Experience.Different animals are shown n cool atmosphere."
,,Zoo at night,2.0,,It is the same zoo but only in the evening and there are night animals on the move. Nothing special. Only a animal prison.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Recommend this to everyone. Specially the shows were amazing. To look for different animals in the dark, was just an amazing adventure that I'll never forget."
,,Good fun worth pre booking.,4.0,,We pre booked in UK and the tickets included transport. You also get priority boarding on a tram This was well worth it as it does get very crowded. We saw plenty of animals on the tram journey ... and very close but safe!. A good night out.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Incredible experience! It's the only place in the world that I've been to, to view nocturnal animals up close. Trams are available to take visitors around the Safari. The Safari is very well-spaced and the animals are certainly very well cared for. The environment is lush and full of greenery. Visitors can visit the Singapore Zoo and River Safari during the day as they are in the same vicinity and then proceed with the Night Safari. All three sites are worth seeing!!"
,,Too much hassle,5.0,,"The safari its self is must see, there is a lot of people, and not organized at all.
we liked up for about 2 hours, there was some fights between Indians and Chinese.
Chinese jumps in front of your at the line, and Indians want to bring the whole family at the end of the wait line, once you let the first person to pass you, the rest will follow and they can be very rude. if you don't want to take the ride to explore the safari. just go to the left after you enter the gate and enjoy the walk, if you want the ride, then you need to wait about an hour and half, depends on the day, and you will hassle again, even during the trip, Chinese people can be very noisy and annoying with their camera and selfies.

We enjoyed the night safari not as much as we were annoyed."
,,Great sight,5.0,,The night safari is spectacular go on the ride more than once to be sure of seeing all the animals do it as a pick three and make big savings with the hop on hop off
,,Unique ride,4.0,,Good ride in battery operated tram. Tickets cost about 42 SGD and is about 35 minutes ride from the city. Tickets can be bought before the ride at the venue itself. As the first ride starts by 715 PM we reached by 630 pm and first saw the fire show. Animals are showcased very nicely in natural environment and one of unique features is we observe them in moonlight lighting. Overall good experience and value for money. A must visit in Singapore itinerary.
,,Best of the Best - Must do this tour,5.0,,"The night Safari is a magical amazing experience for all ages. We attended the latest tour and stayed until 11pm and I must say it was so quiet you felt like it was just you and the animals in the middle of an African jungle. The tram takes you through the enclosures of some animals and sometimes the animals were only arms length away (but you can not touch) it was truly fantastic to see wild animals up close and personal. The enclosures of the lions and elephants and other animals were amazing so open and big, not just hidden behind a glass wall. With the stillness of the night you could hear the lions roar and it felt like it was right behind you it was so loud and clear. There are also 3 or so walking trails that are spectacular we hardly came across anyone else and felt like we had the zoo to ourselves. The night tour is amazing its when most the animals are active and hunting for food so you can see them doing what they do best not just sleeping. This is a must when visiting Singapore."
,,not so amazing anymore,3.0,,"Went 15 years ago and loved it. Came back and think not much has changed. But if you have been in Africa on photo safaris, this attraction is now an overprized children activity with not much thrills and long lines at the shows. Also, no ATM closeby and long bus ride away from downtown."
,,Worth visit,5.0,,Real jungle feel.. too good.. take walk or tram tour as late as possible... Dont miss the animal show in evening.
,,Good!,4.0,,This was a good experience watching animals in night time while chillaxing in the tram. One time watch!
,,Expected more!,3.0,,"Its not bad experience, but maybe my expectations were too high. Most of the animals were sleeping, and if you have any problems seeing far better don`t go. Otherwise ok for visiting with friends, the shows were interesting and fun."
,,"Great Exibits, Awesome Staff, Almost No One Past 9",5.0,,"I was fortunate enought to visit the Night Safari on two different nights in one week (managed to win some tickets, bought the others before that). One night we arrived at 9 and stayed until close, the other night from opening until 10.

I have to say that by 8:45 the amount of people in the park plummets! Everyone arrives right as the park opens, then clears out to get back on their tour buses. This leaves almost just you and all the amazing nocturnal creatures.

While the tram and Creatures of the Night show are great the best part of this tour are the walking trails. Very few people take advantage of them! This is how I got such great photos of the leopards and tigers.

Turn off the flashes on your cameras and phones and enjoy this unique experience!"
,,Only visited the Night Zoo but that was excellent,5.0,,"A very pleasant evening out, with a show to start and then an easy ride round in the train: you can get on and off at some points and there is plenty to see"
,,"Good Tiger's,Elephant's,Hippos,Etc..",4.0,,Nice Night Safari..But Photography Is Not Allowed In The Safari Ride That's A Disadvantage For The Travellers... But It's Helps Animals For Their Vision..Over All Good Experience!
,,A unique way to see nocturnal animals in natural settings,4.0,,"The Night safari in Singapore is a unique way to see nocturnal animals in their wilderness like setting. The night safari is a separate section of the zoo and you climb aboard a small trolley train that takes you through the dark along a special trail and highlights the animals you can see as you go by slowly. There is a stop mid way where you can get off and explore local trails on your own as well as trails you can follow right from the start of the zoo. They are readily marked as to what you can see on each trail. Maps are also given out when you first enter.
Following this is a night show every hour on the nearby stage.
We did the tram ride twice, first with our group tour and the tram used a recording to describe what we saw.
The second time, we did it with a live zookeeper who knew the animals, and made it more interesting with stops at key locations. This is the best route.
We were fortunate to be there on a mid week night when there were few crowds so had a great time. We understand at other times the lineups are long and it takes time to wait for the tram."
,,night zoo,4.0,,different experience to watch animals in the night time from tram. visited normal zoos many times but this thing one must try and experience the thrill.
,,Night Safari-- New Experiencce,3.0,,"The Night Safari at Singapore, covers a vast area of about 90 acres of Land.
This Night Safari is an entire open-air zoo set in a humid tropical forest that is only open at night. This Safari can be explored through Walking Traits or by the Train

We were here on 10th February 2016 and we choose to go by Train. Our Agent has already booked our tickets and our time sought was 7.15 pm. We were told to be at the spot 20 minutes before the given time. As Chinese week was being celebrated, there was huge rush. Big queues were seen. It took more than 30 minutes to sit in the train and start Night Safari exploration.

The animals at the Night Safari, ranged from Indian Rhinoceros, Elephants to Tigers. They are made visible by lighting which resembled moonlight. The lighting is dim enough not to disturb nocturnal and the animals' behaviour. We were also advised not to use flash Cameras.

The journey in the train passing through the forest area was good and we could enjoy every bit of it. Though we have seen these animals in Zoo and in the day time, this is a new experience for us and thrilling too.

Night Safari is one of the main tourist attraction and hence there is crowd at all times. There are many shops and Restaurants in the Safari. We could spend easily about three hours at this place and left the place as our scheduled pick up time was fast approaching.."
,,Not bad...do not junglee expect safari,3.0,,"Night safari is kind of a park you can say on which people are taken on golf carts through a kind of a open zoo with what seems like sedated animals..the park opens up at 7 pm in the evening or as soon as it gets dark,main attraction is the tram ride which shows you all nocturnal animals its a 20 min ride in modified golf carts taking through man made jungle not exactly a treat.The ticket price also includes creatures of the night show where in animals perform...meant more for kids and lastly the thumbuwaka fire show...its one of those attractions that you won't regret much if you miss."
,,Almost like a real safari,5.0,,"Be prepared for the crowd! Arrive before your scheduled time at least with 30 mins! The main route can only be taken with the train. Opposite as the Zoo this is the better option to see the animals. The ride is about 40 mins and informative. The animals are lit with pale lights like it was full moon but you can see them clearly from the train. You can't use flash on your phone/camera so it's hard to take any normal pictures.
You can choose to go around on foot and it takes a few hours only, but you see fewer animals, though you have more time to look at them. Really interesting experience I would visit it again!"
,,Fabulous and rare opportunity,5.0,,"Not many places you can see nocturnal critters at their most active. Whilst the zoo is also brilliant, if choosing between the Night Safari would get my vote, purely because it is done so well and something that can not be easily found elsewhere.

Should be high on the list even if only in Singapore for a few days."
,,School holidays!,3.0,,"Crowded and long queue esp. durung school holidays! Not worth to visit at peak seasons due to the crowd and duration/ time of waiting for the ride might be up to 1-2hrs. If you have small kids or elderly with you, I suggest you come on another day to prevent the kids from throwing tantrums or your parents standing there for hours waiting for the ride. Everything's selling at Night Safari is not cheap includes of foods and drinks. Make sure you don't go there with empty stomach!

Might be a little difficult to see certain animals due to the darkness and visitors are not allowed to feed or provoke the animals during the ride. The tickets itself quite costly and very hot while you are in the queue due to the crowd and the amounts of people's visiting during school holidays.

It might be a bad day or bad timing to go on raining season as you might get wet and the walking patch might be slippery after the rain. Thus, walk carefully and held your parents and kids to prevent from any unwanted injuries. Flash light is not allowed while using camera, taking picture with your hand phone as this might trigger the animals or causing harm to the ur eyesight due to sudden flash from your device."
,,Night zoo,5.0,,"Was in Singapore for a work meeting, & we made a trip to the Night Zoo. Had such a wonderful time visiting all the nocturnal animals that you don't normally get to see. Had dinner at the zoo, which was surprisingly good. A really enjoyable night out for everyone involved. If you have time on a stop-over, it's so worth going."
,,Fun and different.,5.0,,We enjoyed this zoo. We decided to see it at night which we hadn't experienced before. Well worth doing. A small train takes you through the jungle and spot animals in their natural habitat at night. Safe walking trails also. A good variety of animals. We saw lion tiger bear deer otter and more many of which are endangered.
,,Unreal!,5.0,,"You so have to do this if you are in Singapore. This was great from start to finish. My advice would be not to rush to do the safari tour as soon as you get there - everyone does. Do the walk tour first - it's easy walking and you get so close to the animals. It's amazing. Took us about an hour or so to walk around the track, but when we got back, we were able to get straight on to the safari bus. This us amazing to. It takes you into other areas where the walk doesn't. Food was ok - but then, we didn't go for the food. Caught a taxi to and from the zoo - not too bad and cost was ok. All round loved it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We first sat at Bongo burgers from where we saw the thumbhakar performance. It was breathtaking. Then entry started. No doubt there was rush. All were going to the tram stop. But we first decided to watch the creatures of night show. After that we did all the walking trails. It took less than 40 mins to cover all these trails. It was a first time experience. I feel everyone must do the walking trails. then we went for tram ride. By then there was no rush. Overall once in lifetime experience
,,Awesome place to visit,5.0,,"Really thrilling experience, when you see wild animal freely walking around, in night and amidst their habitat, awesome feeling yet keep it contained, as they are still wild beast, and any close encourter with these animals are forbidden, as the personnel of the safari will take you around in a closed but open windows-trailer /train in night and people can see all animals in harmony, in open, families of lion, tigers, giraffe, zebra, gazelle, antelop, elephant free....and incredible and breath taking view....just loved it !!!"
,,Should be on everyone's to do list in Singapore,5.0,,"A great way to end the day, we did this after visiting the Gardens by the Bay. I've visited Singapore many times, yet this was my first time doing the Night Safari. Glad I got share the moment with family. Not much to add that everyone here haven't already said. But what stood out for me was that there isn't and fence between you and the animals. Can you imagine a group of hyenas lunging at you? Or a bear? Should be on everyone's 'to do list' maybe not at the top of the list for some people, but it should be on that list. We went on a week night. Arrived around 9pm and pretty much had a 5 minute wait to hop on the tram."
,,A stroll in the dark,5.0,,"This is a stroll in the dark with a difference. Whereas some of the animals are not visible by day, at night they come out and are a treat to see. Obviously some are more reclusive than others, requiring greater concentration to spot them. A worthwhile exercise - take the walk rather the the train for a good aerobic workout. There are some steep inclines so may rate as challenging for some."
,,Great adventure,5.0,,Good selection of animals in a sensitive setting with large enclosures and seemingly all in good health and not stressed. They are keen to push the recycling to save the planet but not so much anti killing of Tigers for traditional medicine or re Rhino horn. Get there close to opening as it gets very busy on the Tram safari ( included in $42 ticket price)
,,Always enjoyable,5.0,,"The Night Safari is really a 'must visit' if you are in Singapore. It's cool to walk at night and there are so many unusual animals to see. Of course it's expensive ($42) but it's a whole evening's entertainment and truly memorable. The trick really is to manage the crowds as its always busy. Most people go around 7pm to get a full evening and I do too. But at this time the tram is really crowded so rather than waste time queuing I start walking the Fishing Cat trail. This has much to see and ends at East Lodge where you can pick up a drink and the tram if you want to. However I continue to follow the footpaths and finally end up in the new Australian section with fake caves... fun for the children! This whole walk takes about 2 hours if you stop and look at everything. By this time the trams are much emptier and you waste no time. Although you have seen plenty of animals as you walk the trams go to area's not open to walkers and are amazing as they get close to herds of deer, tapirs and other night creatures. There are also animal shows but likewise... It's good to see when the last show is, and fit it in between the walk and the tram or you just end up jostling with crowds and wasting time."
,,A zoo experience with a difference,5.0,,I have never been to a zoo at night before - but very worth while experience seeing creatures when they are normally active. Everything laid out with great thought to the animals. very popular with the locals.
,,Animals in Night,4.0,,"The night safari is a very popular attraction. Shows start at 7, but queues start much earlier. There are also restaurants which serve a variety of cuisine. Once there, visitors take a tram which gives a tour of the various attractions. Plenty of animals like lions, elephants can be see very close. The tour ends up with an animal shown which is fun to watch."
,,"exciting attraction, sweaty though",5.0,,"Love the atmosphere, must reach there by 7pm to catch all the attraction, performance at the entrance, nice food before going in, stay the whole night and experience safe but exciting animal sounds, even almost centimeters away from leopard (thick glass separation though). Walking near the wolves den you may experience hair raising howl, which I did, 20 meters away. bats fly above you, ant eater at close proximity. FUN!!"
,,"Please do not miss this experience, you will not find it anywhere else",5.0,,"Walking around all kind of animals at night in open air in open car in a rainforest is such a refreshing experience and like a dream, must do."
,,I was so excited about visiting but.....,4.0,,I had heard from so many people and on the internet that this was the most visited attraction in Singapore and that you MUST visit. I was very excited so on recommendation I booked with a tour company. I was told from a few people if you go by yourself you could end up waiting 2 hours in line but you are guaranteed a time slot with a tour company. To be honest it was all very rushed. We went to an animal show first which was very poor. The presenter spoke most of the time and we only saw 3 animals in the 30 minute show. The safari itself which lasted 45 minutes was interesting but not great. We did walk around the trails a bit and we thought that was better. We were all a bit disappointed to be honest. If you are in Singapore you should try and go but don't put it at the top of your 'do-see' list.
,,Good night at the zoo,5.0,,Animals were very active on this night following a very hot day. The animals will sleep during a hot day and we saw them on an active night.
,,Night Safari - Evening Walk in the jungle,4.0,,You wont get to see much as heard but over all its good experience as its like a evening or night walk in jungle trails. Sometimes it is very difficult to see the animals in the dark but there is no other option. This visit also includes one small animal show & some fire stunts at the entrance.
,,Not that impressed...,3.0,,"We were a group who visited the zoo at night, and were to take the tram around. First of all I think the experience would have been better if we had walked, but after taking the tram I would never get to that. When you drive around a automatic voice tells you about the animals and asks questions which is very annoying. It also makes a sound to wake up the animals for us too see, and if that is not enough - the food truck which drives behind will make sure the animals will come forward. For me this is not the way to show animals in their nature - and I am also well aware that we might have missed some if they did not use that set up. But you can't promise sun on a beach either..."
,,I will never get bored of it!,5.0,,"How this isn’t higher up the list of “things to do in Singapore” I will never know. The Shoppes at Marina Bay rank above it – really!?

I bought a membership pass as I knew I would have visitors to Singapore. I took friends and family, and they all loved it!

Book online in advance using a mastercard and get 10% off, use a Singaporean card and get 15% off! You also avoid the need to queue for tickets.

People will queue for ages to ride on the tram the whole way round the park, but you only need to do that for the non-pedestrian bit (to see the elephants, roaming deer, white lions etc.).

Take your time to see the animals close up…deer, birds, bats, slow loris…

OK, some of the animals aren’t nocturnal, but seeing them at night is still pretty cool. There aren’t many other places where you can do that. The show isn’t amazing, but still worth going to!

Try and go midweek as the weekends are particularly busy, and DON’T do it in a tour group – they rush you through, and you ruin it for everyone else!"
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"I would say this is must visit place,lovely location and best for the animal lovers, as they are given much free space than other Zoo, The train you take can cover more place."
,,Great to see but very small cages,4.0,,"It's a zoo, which is inherently problematic. Most cages are beautifully designed but very cramped. I hope the animals have larger spaces to roam during the day and only move into those spaces to be fed during the brief opening hours.

Make sure you visit the bats, they have lots of room and are totally unafraid, will inspect you from their perches a few feet away while they munch on dinner."
,,A good evening,4.0,,"We took a tour from the hotel, which whilst probably a bit more expensive was convenient - $58/head. This included priority to get on the tram. As it happened it was a Tuesday and not very busy. A fun trip round the park with lots of animals to see - took about an hour. Followed by some Indian food which was fine - a quick look at the fire-eating show at 9pm, a quick walk round the Wallaby Walk and then the animal show. This was kind of fun with an entertaining presenter but not too many animals. Well woth it overall."
,,Interesting experience !!,3.0,,"Good concept having a safari in the night, you will get to watch lot of animals up close.
Was amazing seeing the animals in the dark.
One thing to note, the park is very popular, queue was really really loong, come early and get a early slot. Park opens at 7.15 but crowd gathers from 6pm.

Must mention the show Creatures of the night show which was very entertaining and the person hosting the show was a great entertainer."
,,Not creatures OF the night but animals IN a night setting.,2.0,,"A great idea, a night zoo, but too little in the way of nocturnal animals to make it a genuine experience. The Advertising gives the impression that you will see creatures OF the night but no, this is simply creatures IN a night setting with spotlights on them and they have been just given food to make them available as your tram drives past. I feel sorry for them having to eat four or more times a night just to have them in position!
The cave walk through with snakes etc sounded exciting and a little dangerous - no, very few exhibits and very fake stone corridors.
Must get a lot of people at times because the queuing lines available are very long. We were lucky to go on a slow night so just ducked under ropes to navigate empty lines.
The show was lame, relying on two opportunities to have members of the audience be the star attraction as they were made fun of.
Want to see a great show with wild animals? catch the birds of prey show at Currumbin Wildlife Centre at Currumbin, Gold,Coast, Queensland, Australia."
,,A special experience,5.0,,"One can enjoy wildlife from the train-car tour, without having the feeling of animal being in cages. A lot of trails available for people who like walking. I recommend to buy tickets online for a specific hour slot, so you will get in without queuing for tickets."
,,Not good at all.,2.0,,Really guys don't bother with this. It was a total waste of one of our nights. The little team/bus goes too fast for you to get a good look at the animals. Honestly don't bother. I believe the zoo is much better (we didn't go so can't say much more)
,,Night Safari,3.0,,It was okay. Not what I expected. I know its a safari but we didn't see much and for me it was to dark. The Fire eaters before the safari were much more entertaining.
,,Evening at the Zoo,4.0,,"My husband loves zoo's so when he read about this night safari it was one of our first tours we booked while in South East Asia. It did not disappoint. It was amazing seeing the animals in the dark. Even though at times some were difficult to see, but a fun evening in Singapore"
,,"As advertised, a real gem!",5.0,,"I know there is plenty of reviews on the Night Safari.
After visiting Singapore many times, this is the first time with my Wife, and it's stopped me drinking and given me the excuse tondo all the tourist trips.

Couples, Solo s, Families with school age children(5+), this is a excellent venue, it's amazing how close you really get.

Allow at least, at least 3 hours!

Night Safari, Thank You.

Sorry about the poor pictures!"
,,I couldn't have loved it more,5.0,,"They say that no two visits to the night safari are the same, and it's true. You really can't say what you will see there, for instance, I saw the leopards up close (to my delight), but I couldn't find the flying squirrels. I guess it adds to the fun because we enjoyed searching for the animals, and it was so cool once we spotted them. You can really see the animals roaming about at night, very interesting! The Mangrove Walk was the most exciting, the bats were huge and really, really close. The tram ride was very good also. Some tips:

1. This is really popular with tourists so arrive early, or get tickets in advance. Even though the park opens at 19:15, there were many people already waiting as early as 6PM
2. Do the walking trails first, and go for the tram ride afterwards, the tram queues can be very long when the park opens
3. Apply insect repellent to bare skin
4. Not for rainy days"
,,One of a kind experience.,5.0,,The animals are at a surprisingly close proximity and are doing their thing. Vast variety of animals to be seen.
,,Nice is u get in early.. Read more Tips in this review!!,4.0,,"Our Experience: We had booked tickets online and since the 7.15 slot was booked we could get in through thee 8.15 slot.. due to this we had to wait outside for a really long time and it was actually time wasted.. when we went in finally we saw the creatures of the night show first.. then went on the tram ride.. since we were travelling with senior citizens we skipped the trail walks as they were not very comfortable with that.. but i guess it wud have been a good experience..

TIPS:
1. There are 3 Aspects to this attraction.
a. Creatures of the night show - it is a stage show where different nocturnal animals perform.
b. Tram ride - it is a 20mins ride through the conservatory showing u different animals and along with very interesting information.
c. Trail walks - in this u have to just walk around by urself in the conservatory and see the animals along the trails..
2. Make sure u book an early slot online or contact some travel agency or something..because i noticed that almost all of the people who were in the early slots were wearing batches of various travel agencies..
3. If u think the Tram ride line is massive dont waste ur time there just move to the creatures of the Night Show. The tram ride lines get smaller as the night goes along so u will get a shorter wait time.
4. it is advisable to keep the trail walks as the last activity there so that u can take a peaceful stroll in the moon light watching all the animals that u come across in the trails.Unless ur scared of the dark or u feel uneasy to walk the trails so late at night.
5. It is extremely important that u select ur day to visit this place when ther weather forecast is not showing rains or thunderstorms."
,,Too much of a show,3.0,,"Although good to experience once, I find it as too much of a put up show - can be a bit disappointing at times."
,,Interesting but busy and a little tacky,3.0,,Went on a tour to the Night Safari which was not up to much more a bus ride out with something speaking nonsense to you. The zoo itself was quite fun with a few animals to see but not as many as I would have liked. Food was fast and not great.
,,great experience for jungle lovers!!,5.0,,"By its name only it describes how interesting the place will be.we reached there by 6-6.15pm and then we started our tram ride.it was a real nice experience as just before we started our tram ride it was raining but by god's grace rain stopped as soon as we started our ride and so we can feel the freshness of nature and the smell of rain forest.The feeling was beyond expectation.the night had started falling and then it was a real jungle experience.we saw bison,hyna,white lion,elephant,deer,asian tiger,hippopotamus,rhinosaurus,giraffe,kangaroo etc.then after the tram ride we we went to see the show named ""Creatures of the Night"".it was just mind blowing show!!!trainning those wild animals is not an easy thing so really salute and hats off!!!!to those who train those animals!!!animals who performed in that show was racoon,hyna,leopard,snake,meerkat.after this show we went to see the ""Thumbuakar""TribalPerformance.it was really dangerous for those who were performing as they were performing with fires!!we were just speechless as it was fab!!!so much risk those people take justto entertain us.hats off guys!!!!after that we had dinner there.there were all types of foods like Indian,Chinese,etc.we ate delicious hotdogs and cranberry and strawberry flovoured Gelato.overall it was a really nice experience."
,,Average visit,2.0,,We were really excited for this safari but it failed to fulfill all our excitement as shows were quite average..only fire show was good to attract people's.. We went through toy train to take a ride to jungle to watch animals but there were not much animals at that time. Overall it was ok but not too worth.. Jungle ride was ok.. You can take jungle ride by walk as well that may b adventureous..
,,One time visit.. Must go..,4.0,,"Nice place to go and experience wild life.. Take the Tram for going around as it will be too hectic to walk inside.. Visit in evening.. Be there around 6pm, so that you can cover night safari, shows etc on time.. Overall a nice place in Singapore.."
,,Do not miss when you are in Singapore,5.0,,Nice experience of night safari. The tribal fire show is excellent. Unique experience of walk through the zoo in night.
,,A very different Zoo,5.0,,"We have all been to zoos , of course Singapore does it differently. A Night Zoo Safari! The route takes you past the nocturnal animals whose feeding points close to the route. Then there are food outlets and entertainment . A super experience ."
,,Must visit for Tourists,5.0,,Awesome place. A must visit for tourists. Great live shows. This is definitely a recommended visit. Passed the ticketing queue using the Singapore Pass.
,,Experience the jungle by sitting in the tram,4.0,,We did night safari post visit of Singapore Zoo whole day. I guess it is the same area of Zoo being used fir night safari but with different routes and some new animals. We saw some of the gates were closed while we were in the Zoo which may by opened during night safari. It is adventurous to see these animals at night and that too without cage. There is continuous announcement as brief intro of each of the animals we see from tram. Overall nice experience.
,,An OK evening out,3.0,,"To be honest we were expecting more from this. Going around on the train meant that you could only see the animals if they were in the right place at the right time; you had no time to stop and wait for them to move etc. We did get off part way through to walk around the big cats but unfortunately it began to rain heavily. There was entertainment near the entrance which was good, some nice food outlets and all the staff we had dealings with were really friendly and helpful."
,,"""Nice experience""",4.0,,"That was a part of our travel package, although it was not as great as it was expected. But yes it worth paying one visit. Live shows like Fire play was worth watching. These experts put really hard work and efforts to do such things. Hatsoff."
,,Mediocre,3.0,,I heard great reviews but what you get is a tram ride in the dark with animals no more active than at any other zoo I've toured. All this in a Jurassic Park atmosphere surrounded by tourist food and cheap souvenir shops. Save your time. And your money.
,,Over-rated but unique,3.0,,"Avoid the weekends especially, but the Night Safari is a mob scene any day of the week. Over-rated, as it's dark because the animals are nocturnal. The animal show is strictly for children. Do get off the tram and walk the pathways to see some interesting wildlife."
,,Must Do for kids,5.0,,It is a must do for kids and they would simply love it here with the kind of atmosphere there is.. Also they have a number of animals so no one would go disappointed. Four different walking trails and also you may just visit in on the tram it is entirely open to you.. Opens at around 7 15 pm till 12 am in the morning.. It is a must visit if you have little kids
,,Thriller!,5.0,,"I dont really like the idea of caged animals, but i guess this visit thrills me in certain ways. It is really dark and dim in this zoo, you can hardly see anything in the zoo, we came so close to almost an arm length till we spot the black panther staring at us! I guess in real nature, we would had been eaten by this huge cat! We are grateful that the glass wall seperate us from the beast! What a shocking experience!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Although we were put off by the Long unruly line, we loved the experience. We saw the tram lines were full, so we decided to walk and that was the best thing to do, we saw parts of the Safari the trams couldn't get to."
,,One of the 1st Night Safari Zoo,4.0,,Mandai Night Safari is one of the 1st Zoo to operate this. You can walk on the trail and get closed to the many animals which is exciting and toward nature walk
,,Its a zoo not safari,1.0,,everything is so artificial and fixed nothing natural. We were giggling on how stupid we were to be on that tram...
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"Singapore zoo it's a must have experience. Been there 5 times. River & night safaris - are my favourites.
Bring your own food and prepare to spend there the whole day.
I usually go to the zoo in the afternoon, when the zoo close, I proceed to the night safari. There is a restaurant with nice fire show - spare time just enough to have a dinner and rhea proceed to the night safaris that starts after sunset."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"The noght safari is a quire unique experience but my suggestion is to actually walk it. Unlike day time when the animals all tend to be quite sleepy, the zoo takes on a completely different complexion at night.

A highly recommended attraction. If you wanat to do the night safari the way 95% of people do which is to use the carriages provided, get there early. It gets incredibly busy."
,,Exception way to experience the wildlife!,4.0,,"This was the second time we been in the Night Safari Singapore and still we were as amazed as we were at the first time, specially for our kid it was like a lifetime memory! The whole ambiance, including food stalls and the souvenir shops, of the safari area is really interesting. The Tram ride is thrilling though the long queue is tiredly. Get prepared to stand in the queue for at least 30 mins. The night show at the amphitheater is OK but for the first time only.
Its a fantastic way of getting close to the wildlife, specially if you have kid along with you."
,,"""No, no, no""",1.0,,"Terrible experience. We were there last January. Were waiting 4 hours in the line. 4 hours. Totally unorganized, unpolite crew. Extremely slow. Animals were nice, ofcourse. But whole trip was complete waist of time."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"My husband and I have been to plenty of zoos around the world, so instead of visiting the Singapore Zoo during the day, we chose to do the Night Safari instead. We pre-booked our tickets which specifics an entry time. When we arrived though, there was a long queue that everyone had to wait in, and we assume it's because they let in large groups in batches. It took us about 45 minutes to get through the queues to get on the tram that offers a narrated tour around the zoo. It wasn't fun standing outside in the muggy air, but the tram ride was worth it. It's very difficult to get pictures because of the darkness and movement, so we put our cameras away and just enjoyed the experience. The guide was knowledgeable and funny, and it was really neat to see the animals so active at night. If you have the time, you should definitely check this out!

Note, the Night Safari is a decent distance away from the centre of the city. There are bus options, or you can take a cab which wasn't that expensive."
,,Very unique - opportunity to see so many nocturnal creatures,4.0,,"Like the zoo, this is very innovative and great. And for so many of the animals, it seems as though their habitats are quite adequate. But again the exception is for the bigger cats - enclosed in tight pens where they are clearly unhappy and pace maniacally."
,,Night safari with animals,5.0,,"One of the best views and experience on your visit to Singapore.
You will feel you so close to nature and animals that you do not want to go back.
Amazing sights of wildlife with Tiger, Lion, Giraffe, Elephants, Crocodile...everthing you ask for.
Kindly note that no flash light to be used while taking pictures as it will frighten the animals."
,,Great Concept,4.0,,"Never before have we been to a zoo at night- what a great idea! A lot of animals become very active at this time, and so it can be a great time to spot them. We really enjoyed traveling in the tram and there is a good and varied collection of animals. There are foot trails so you can hop on and off if you wish to explore further routes in your own time.

The queues to get in are huge as are the ones for the trams, it took absolutely ages for us to finally get going-also when you hop off you have to wait again until there is a space somewhere for you to get back on, this was a real pain. However, we did have a really enjoyable evening seeing animals in a completely different setting and I would definitely recommend giving this trip a go-just be aware it's a really long way out if you are making your own way from the city centre via the MRT and public busses (as we did) will be much quicker and easier to try to find a trip that is heading there anyway and hop onto that.
We got an organised bus back home to the hotel again after for 5 dollars each which was much cheaper and quicker than making our own way again-but we enjoyed the experience using the public transport system and going through the suburbs on local busses it's all part of the adventure."
,,Different view of the animals,4.0,,"We arranged this before we left the UK. We were picked up at the hotel and taken to the departure point where we were appointed into another bus.
At the ""Night safari"" we first had a meal which was of good quality.Following that we were directed to the train. Straight on with no delays. I have been fortunate to see a lot of these animals in daylight and in the wild. OK It's a zoo but to see these animals at night gave it a different slant entirely.
Following that there was a fire eating act which was enjoyable, alternatively we could have opted for a walking tour, then back to the bus for the transport back to Singapore.
I can't remember how many times tne departure time and location was given out,it was a lot. I hope the two persons that were missing got back to their hotel and weren't consumed by the lions.
Overall very good"
,,An Interesting Take on a Zoo,3.0,,"This is basically a night zoo. You board a tram that takes you around the zoo in about 40 minutes. There are a few stops where you can disembark and stroll along some of the trails to get a closer view of the animals. If you are a photographer, you will be very disappointed. No flash is allowed and even though the team only moves at about five miles and hour, the park is way to dark for taking pictures. There are only two shows in the park so if you're going to be there for a while plan on seeing those shows. This is basically a night time zoo theme park."
,,Over-rated,3.0,,"Don't do it when you're jet lagged.... I fell asleep on the train it was so dull.
The kids weren't too amazed by the number of deer that were grazing at night and the only lion to poke his head out didn't make the mark.
The show beforehand felt like it had been put together 20 minutes before showtime.
It might have been better for smaller children but I definitely wouldn't advise it for those over 12. The price and hype is really excessive.
The zoo itself is supposed to be much better... during the day however."
,,"Very different zoo experience, great value for money",5.0,,"This is a totally different zoo experience, and a highly recommended one. It was easily accessible by MRT and bus with our Singapore travel pass (directions on night safari website). The zoo experience was totally different, with a tram ride and tour through big animals, dropping you off at 2 points which take you on 4 walking trails where you can see smaller animals. We went on a drizzly night so there were no lines, but the animals were super active- we also followed a keeper around for a bit of feeding time which helped. The lighting at the zoo is specially designed to imitate moonlight, and where possible natural barriers like moats and rivers are used instead of fences which felt as authentic as a zoo can feel. I'd recommend getting there early (7 30 or so) so you have plenty of time to do the shows and all the trails- we arrived about 8 30 and took our time but didn't get to see creatures of the night show."
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,Had a very enjoyable evening exploring the Night Safari. We did the walking tour first (as the queue for the tram was huge) and took the tram at the end of the night (and practically had it to ourselves). There is lots to see and the enclosures are well laid out. Wear comfortable shoes if you plan on doing the walking tour (which is worth doing) as there is a decent amount of walking involved! The only downside is that this place is hard to get to on public transport and you will almost definitely need to get a taxi back (but there is a well serviced taxi rank outside). Make sure you take a normal taxi rather than one of the 'deluxe' ones or you will get billed a lot more! Typically it is mostly the deluxe ones that turn up to the taxi rank!
,,Don't go on a rainy day,1.0,,"First make sure to go with a guide that has priority boarding on the train as you will wait for hours otherwise. Second, don't go on a rainy day as you will see nothing. Third, make sure you have a bus organized to get back to the city as you will spend hours again to wait for a taxi otherwise."
,,Well-orchestrated Night Views,5.0,,Very well designed and constructed views of a good variety of animals. We enjoyed the tram ride with real time information coverage of the various animal enclosures. Lighting was great.
,,great way to see the animals,5.0,,can be a bit busy but you do have all evening to wander or take the 'train' around the park. Cleverly done so that it seems that there is no barrier between you and the animals. if you want to see the show then get there well before the start time as it is often very busy.
,,A different experience of the zoo,5.0,,It's the day zoo seen in the night time that is the only difference..but the experience is totally different from the other zoos..the nocturnal show was also good..a fire show is also there..
,,Pleasant evening activity,3.0,,"Very busy but well organised.
Staff were helpful.
The ice cream was excellent.
The tour was good especially for younger kids.
The opportunity to walk around was interesting.
Probably a bit too jet lagged to fully enjoy it - so perhaps not the first night you get there after a long haul flight ."
,,Good fun alternative Zoo visit,4.0,,"The night safari exhibits animals in a night time environment very well. The zoo is kept very dark so you can see the wildlife as one would at night. We felt the tram ride around the safari wasn't worth it as the wait was 45 minutes to an hour and it only encompasses a small part of the zoo compared to the walking tracks. It was a very nice walk and exhibited many creatures which you could look at up close. A must do, especially if you have already been to the zoo during the day."
,,"Sadly, not worth the money",2.0,,"We took this as a recommended trip, booked before we left England. So disappointed! The buffet meal was luke warm food, and we were amongst the first to eat, so later diners would find it even worse. The variety of food was OK however. The train ride around the park was only mildly interesting, many animals only seen lying down or sleeping. The walk around was better as you could take your time. Finally, the creatures of the dark show, whilst well presented, was again, very overstated. Save your money and spend it on more interesting excursions, Singapore is full of much better attractions."
,,Long queue for the tram.,4.0,,"A 40 minute queue for the tram on arrival (even though the tickets are timed), spoils the visit somewhat. Once on the tram, it's really interesting, with close-up encounters with lions, tigers, antelopes, rhinos etc. Just be prepared to be in a long queue with hundreds of others. If you choose to walk around, the animal sightings are more limited, but there are good things to see, such as bats and free-roaming wallabies."
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,Its a unique experience as very few places provide a night tine view of wild animals. Although the trip is not as wild as it may sound . There is a set path and animals are in semi-enclosures
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"After the day zoo, I wouldn't recommend the night zoo. Pick one or the other, or go on two consecutive days. But this is just as impressive as the day zoo!!"
,,Great and unique experience,5.0,,"It was really nice to sit inside or walk along the Safari at night. The quiet and natural environment made u feel really relaxed.

The ride was free and it was equiped with special trained staff. The illustration and the introduction of the animals was fabulous! These people also speaks beautiful English! If you say you can see many things during the day, then you can feel and listen to more things at night!

I love night safari more than the day tour of the zoo!"
,,Very interesting !,4.0,,"We had a great time when we went on guided tour to the night safari. We were very lucky with our tour company, buffalo tours that managed to get a priority team & didn't have to wait in the long queues. Worth every dollar ! All hype animals so tame !"
,,A Zoo like any other,1.0,,"If you like to stay 2.5 hours in a cue to do a 40minute unspectacular night safari, then give it a go!"
,,It seemed fun...,2.0,,"It wasn't.

The animals are pretty tired and just lie there. Theyre not easy to see because you are such a distance from them. This was okay but boring... basically an outdoor train ride in the dark.

For the price you can do something much more fun. The animals do look well looked after though!"
,,Much Hyped but Dissappointing,2.0,,"We visited the Night Safari on an organised tour, with dinner, and being in a group is frankly the only way to go there if you want to avoid lengthy queues

Dinner was average, almost poor to be honest and seemed expensive for what you got, although everything in Singapore is costly. The safari is on a little land train and gives you a dusky glimpse of the animals but not a great experience, it being dark of course. Most impressive was the 20 seconds as we passed the tiger, but that's right opposite some bears that didn't get a look-in

On alighting, we had time to walk some of the paths and this was much more rewarding; the surface is good and well-lit and you have time to see the animals from whichever angle they're best viewed. Excellent view of a couple of jaguars just a metre away through the glass

However, net-net, we were recommended this trip and it didn't live up to the hype"
,,Nice safari journey,4.0,,"It was jam packed evening, still managed to flow in and enjoyed the safari ride. Must for kids and family."
,,Waste of time!,2.0,,"I didn't wanna be too negative about this place but I really didn't have a good experience here. The prices were different as to what I had seen online and the staff were unable to help me with any questions I had. It was seriously busy and it is quite hard to get to so it makes getting home quite difficult/expensive if your not staying nearby. I guess it was kinda cool to wander around in the dark, but a lot of the animals were sleeping (rightly so) and the lighting wasn't great so I imagine if you had young kids it would be a nightmare to keep hold of them. Cool bat enclosure though. Wouldn't go again, wish I had not wasted my money as there are way better things to do in Singapore."
,,Wild experience,5.0,,Proximity to nature redefined! This is a great adventure for nature lover but not for the weak at heart coz the proximity of the animals is sure to send chills down your spine!
,,Night at the zoo,4.0,,Nice cool visit to the zoo at night Many nocturnal animals can be seen Recommend that visits should try the riverine cruisine
,,Very unique experience,5.0,,"Absolutely recommend the night safari. Try to get in the early group - 7:15. We got 8:15 tickets and did the walking tour first. Our group, including 3 children, were so tired from the walking tour, we skipped the tram. The flying squirrels and otters were highlights."
,,Must See..Safari,5.0,,"The night Safari in the zoo is very good. It gives you a perspective of the animals in the night. We took the Tram to go around,but it would be also nice to walk around on your own with a group of friends.Nice Lion and Elephants."
,,Better during day than night,4.0,,"I went to see the night museum. Ok, it must be wonderful to be seen during day time, even if I saw much better zoos, but the night one... it's a bit expensive for what you can see. Long queue to get in and, as all in Singapore, expensive!"
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,"This is one of the unique experiences in Singapore and worth to go. Well arranged and peaceful tram journeys are available and one can sit back and enjoy the wild beauty. If you like to walk, you can see animals nearby. Flash cameras are not allowed in most of the places. Don't miss the shows near entrance. Though you might have gone to zoo, many animals you see in night safari will not be there and vice versa"
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,This adventure is unique among Zoo's worldwide! Great for families too. Any hotel can line this attraction up for you.
,,Amazing attraction,4.0,,"Located at the far west corner of singapore, its easily accessible via MRT and Bus, its an amazing place for an excellent evening out with family."
,,Excellent,5.0,,This place not to miss. Only the problem was big ques since we are visited in Christmas time .It was raining to that make our visit more beautiful. Its well organised safari. One should collect all tickets in advance. Because of rain atmosphere was great. All animals we saw so close. Arrangement for night safari was good. Since we book via agent so return was not difficult (Its little far away from city). So arrange your return in advance.
,,It is okayish!!,3.0,,"When i heard night safari, i had a totally different image in mind.. i thought it would include travelling by open jeep in jungle but it was bit disappointment with what i saw.. the tribal dance was good. creatures of night was again ok and something amazing."
,,Different.,5.0,,"This was OK but we pre-booked went with an organised trip which was late leaving to get there and we were informed during the journey by our guide that we would not be allowed any refund of any sort and only had 5 minutes to eat our evening meal due to them being late, which we had already paid for! We were allowed a little longer in the end to eat which was excellent food but I've never eaten so quickly and felt dreadful afterwards but we had to get our allotted slot for the safari which was good. There was a fire eating show also going on."
,,A good night safari,3.0,,"The Night Safari in Singapore is fairly well done and the animals seem to be well cared for but the humans are not treated very well. There was a mad rush to get on the trolleys that take you around to see the animals and there was a long wait on winding lines. I felt like I was in Disney World. Once you get on the trolley it is enjoyable but of course there are the annoying bad guests that take flash photos when they are told not to and have no manners whatsoever. After the ride we went walking through some dark paths to see little exhibits. For the price I would have expected a bit more. Also, this is quite far out of town and you must take a taxi if you don't have a car."
,,A Should have Place In the Night of Singapore,4.0,,"Firstly I want to tell you that this place should be visited at least once to see the Night Life of Singapore with Animals. You can see the Show here in which The mongoose or Tigers are there which is a good Show I think but not the best One. After that you can see the Live Animals from your Eye in the Night, Yes it is true you can see in the Tram Ride...
But Overall according to the cost & all that this is not the must have been place, This is the place where you should have Been if you love the Animals but my Suggestion is that you can try at least once...."
,,Not worth the wait..,3.0,,We had a long long queue to get into the tram and what we saw was lots of deers... Tiger was not spotted and most of the big animals seems to be in hibernation..
,,great experience,5.0,,"we were collected from our hotel and driven to the night safari we started the evening with a lovely buffet meal, drinks other than water are not included we were then taken on a great train ride through the Zoo to see the animals stopping of places of interest, we then had free time to walk through and see what we wanted Great tour guild brilliant night"
,,Night safari is WOW,5.0,,This is part of Singapore zoo but as the name suggests you do it at night so you see animals here that you might not see during the day you can travel on the little train that takes you round or you can do it on foot an excellent section is were the fruit bats are as you are in darkness a the bats fly around you this Safari is a must if you are visiting Singapore
,,Great Time,4.0,,We made a day and night at the Zoo's. The night Zoo was great. Our first visit was about 5 years ago and they have expanded since then. Lines were a bit long at the entrance as we were there right on opening time. Good to see the animals at night using both the tram and also the walking paths. Tiring day do both the Singapore Zoo and Night zoo. Well worth it
,,Brilliant evening,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. Well presented, saw some amazing nocturnal animals, some too close for comfort - our choice to go through the bat cave! Couldn't have bettered the evening, be aware food outlets close earlier than the park, we did walks first then the tram, so avoided the tram queues."
,,Nice visit!,4.0,,"I was a bit sceptical about this attraction, I though it was more for childs but actually me and my family really enjoyed it! It's a really different excursion, very surprising! The only (really) bad point is the queue, it can be very discouraging!
Other than that, my brother could not walk properly because of an accident but the park's staff helped us during all our visit by providing wheelchair, opening the way to us and allow us to join the priority line! Thank you very much for that, it was really professional and we really appreciated it!"
,,If you forgive the queues this is great,4.0,,Singapore Night Zoo has a big reputation to live up to... and largely it did. There was a big queue to get in and big queue to wait for the 'train' but once you were on the tour the animals were introduced and it felt like you were travelling through a genuine safari with little sign of fences.. Its definitely worth making the effort to go and do the walk too as you get chance to see some of the animals in a more peaceful way. The night theatre was well delivered and fun.
,,Underwhelming,1.0,,"We visited on a Saturday evening during the Chinese NewYear festival.
The queues were huge. We did the Tram Tour first and, whilst it was good to see the animals in their natural habitats, it was so dark. Photography was impossible.
We next watched the Thumbuakar Performance which was the fire eating show. This was spectacular and was the best part of the evening.
We had to queue for the Creatures of the Night Show. What a let down. The host spent at least 10 minutes showing that she could say hello and turn off your flash in many many languages and we eventually got to see just 3 animals - a bunturong which chose a grape, a snake which got placed on a guests neck and an otter trained to pick up rubbish. What a waste of time and definitely not as promoted in their leaflet which states ""20 minutes of non stop action as our star animals ....... Amaze you with their predatory and survival instincts.""

We didn't do any of the trail walks. Too dark.

Very disappointed."
,,Night safari was cool!,5.0,,My kids and I enjoyed going through the night safari at the zoo. It was cool to take an evening train ride through the zoo and see the animals close-up. The stage-show presentation was entertaining and educational. The emcee was hilarious!
,,Washed out,3.0,,"It was very crowded. Even though we areived at 7pm, we were waiting in line for ages to get on the tram, it then started pooring. It was quite dark and couldn't always see the animals, and sometimes it felt like we were being told after or before we went past the animal display. Due to torrential rain we didn't go on any of the walking trails. Feel it would have been better earlier in day so had more time and could see the animals better. Price okay for what you got."
,,One or the other,3.0,,"We went here as everyone we spoke to said it was awesome. We also did the zoo, and id definitely say choose one or the other. I personally like the zoo more as you see more animals. But we did just do the tram ride at the safari as it was very busy they said if we get off we wont get back onto the tram. There seemed to be lots of different species of deer along the way, which got boring. Also i expected the animals to be more awake but they werent sadly. Still glad we got to experience it, definitely do them on different days though as its far to big a day to do it all at once!!"
,,Great night out,5.0,,"It was incredibly busy when we visited, with up to 1hr wait to get on the tram. Try to get tickets for the 7.15pm entry time, hop on the tram, then see the show and allow yourself some time at the end of the evening to wander the park. It's a really unique and wonderful experience at nights."
,,Be amazed at Night Safari,5.0,,"This is an excellent attraction for couples and families and we thoroughly enjoyed the shows and the safari ride. Allow yourself plenty of time as there are some walks to do also. The restaurants well cater for lots of guests and there are Asian, Indian choices and beefburgers and fries. Toilet facilities are ample and clean."
,,Perfect setting of wildlife,4.0,,"I loved the Night safari and the way the enclosures were maintained. The ""Creatures of the night show"" was good but I did feel bad for the animals."
,,Wonderful escapade,5.0,,"The night safari is a great way to spend the night with the family as one gets to share good food, watching the animals in as natural a habitat as possible. It's quite interesting but it does get expensive you plan to visit it often"
,,Quite interesting seeing the nocturnal animals full of energy,4.0,,Enjoyed the night zoo went with a tour group which was quite good did not have to queue to get on the tram. We had a buffet dinner which was pretty good though we had to eat first and than do the zoo tour which meant we ate very early and could not relax eating had to be quick.
,,Must see but quite expensive!,5.0,,"Great thing to do if you got a free evening whilst your stay.
You will find great zoos in other places, but the night Safari is absolutely unique!
Especially all the different wild cats are awesome and the best thing is that all the animals are not sleeping but actually active and moving around!!!"
,,Avoid the queues - don't arrive too early.,5.0,,"The Night Safari is an extremely popular attraction and I gather that there can be long queues to get in at opening time. We arrived at 9.30 pm - no queues and straight onto the 'safari train' which takes visitors around the zoo.

I wasn't sure what to expect. I had wrongly assumed that most animals would be asleep at night but they were all wide awake. It was great to see lions prowling around whereas during day time they tend to be sleeping.

The one problem is getting there. No MRT in the vicinity and the nearest MRT stop is Ang Mo Kio on the North East (Red) Line. From the bus station there are buses to the Zoo but it is a 35 minute journey on the bus. For our return we caught one of the regular private buses that run back to Singapore via Orchard Road and the fare was less than the charge for the combined MRT and bus. It would be better to take one of these buses in both directions but take care which operator you choose. Some offer a hotel pick-up with Night Safari entry but charge considerably more for this.

A great night out - and something very different - for a family with children of all ages."
,,Timing is important,3.0,,"It was raining. Show was cancelled due to weather condition. This was my 2nd visit which is better than the 1st. Glad that we manage to go in around 7pm. Though it's named ""Night Safari"", but it is better to be visited when the sky is not darked. At least animals can still be seen. Park should be opened earlier for visitors to go in."
,,A continuous freak out by me,5.0,,"Wow. I can't really put this experience into words. I came here yesterday for my birthday (I'm 22 now) and it was absolutely incredible. As someone who loves animals, seeing the creatures up close and in action was beyond anything. We started at 9.15pm, witnessing a super cool fire show as we were queuing up. We started of with the 'creatures of the night' show, which was really fun with lots of cute animals. The ONLY thing about the show was that they only picked volunteers of Caucasian appearance (I didn't stand a chance to participate ): ) . The place was mighty crowded but we did the walking trail, which was fair more relaxed and empty.
I spent a long time marveling at and appreciating the majestic creatures, just in awe of their natural beauty. I had never seen hyenas, lions, hogs, deers, porcupines, otters, civets, rhinos and all the different cats at such a distance. They all looked super healthy and happy and the enclosures looked well-fitted with lots of vegetation and space.
A thing that was annoying were tourists that kept shining their flashes at the animals to get a better look, and banging on the glass and making lots of noise to encourage the animals to be more active. I think more keepers are required in some of the areas to control the tourists better.

I walked half the trail and took the tram to see the bigger animals (zebra, giraffe, indian wolves etc), but this was only due to time constraints as I had spent 2 hours doing 3 trails. I recommend arriving at the Night Safari at 7pm and walking the entire park to get the full experience. The hyenas were my absolute favorite and I wished I had been walking for that part since the tram only stopped by for a minute. I would have watched them play forever.

Overall, it was an incredible experience for an animal lover like me and I would do it 10 times again."
,,Educational and enjoyable tour,4.0,,"It was a really nice tour and so well done. There were a large variety of animals to see on the tour. It was a great way for young children to discover and appreciate new animals. You have the option of getting out and exploring the park on foot and getting closer to the animals.

Yes the lines were long, but they continued to move steadily. The park was well organized."
,,It's very touristy,2.0,,"Having said that, it was great to be able to see the animals in a down time and the tour was intimate when you got to interact with nocturnal animals."
,,A different experience,5.0,,"This is a one of a kind experience. Right from the time you take the Safari, the one hour is truly well spent. Starting 6.30 p.m. onwards, this spectacle adjacent to the zoo offers a connoisseur nocturnal views of the beautiful animals. Great upkeep and wonderful professionalism displayed"
,,Best in Class,5.0,,"This is the best in class and well maintained . Dont miss the fun, specifically children will enjoy ."
,,Must do Night Safari,4.0,,After reading mixed reviews on tripadvisor we decided to go anyway as we love animals and really enjoyed the Singapore Zoo. It was very hot on the walking trails and there were some animals we just didn't get to see i.e. the mongoose but it was still an enjoyable experience. The tram ride is very relaxing and educational. Would definately recommend - just remember the Aeroguard and lots of cold water.
,,Done well,3.0,,"The actual safari bit is done very well and great to see so many animals close up and moving as its dark, but quite a treck
to get out there by train and bus and a bun fight getting transportation back, could be better if you go by taxi."
,,Worth paying extra for,5.0,,"We were recommended the Night Safari by a friend and did some homework before leaving Australia. A common theme of dissatisfied reviews was the length of time it took to lineup and get through the crowds. So my wife and I found on their website Premium Tours, where you pay extra, but you get a private tour of the park with your own guide, at your own pace with dinner, reserved seats for the show and no cues. The highlight was feeding the elephants, which no-one else gets to do.

It cost $S200 each, but it was worth the money. This option is only available through emailing the Park days in advance. If you can afford it, and crowds aren't your thing, its worth the money to do this tour in style."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"We bought the ticket and meal combination to give us priority access to the train. This proved to be a good option with the place being packed and queues very long. The meal was good, the train trip excellent with most animals able to been seen. The animal show was superb with the staff providing great entertainment and information on the animals. Make sure you do not miss this. As the zoo is very popular they pack the train. Seats hold 4 and I believe that although you get a clear view from the side seats the middle is best as it allows you to see animals on both sides easily"
,,Not for me.,2.0,,"Unfortunately I cannot find anything to recommend about this. I loved the Zoo, but the Night Safari was a complete waste of my time. Despite already having a ticket, the queue was an hour long to get onto the tour vehicle and then once on we had a very cheesy presenter full of bad jokes taking us around showing us shadowy outlines of bored animals or a patch of empty darkness where a more interesting animal may or may not have been. I could not tell. My night vision is not badger like by any means, but still, I would expect to have seen more.

That said, most of the kids on the train seemed to be enjoying themselves, so maybe it was just me...."
,,Good to get so close to the animals but so crowded!,4.0,,The night safari is well organised and worth doing but it is crowded!! Definitely book a tour which includes collection from your hotel as this gives you a confirmed time slot on a night safari trams - otherwise you'll be queuing for about 2 hours! The night animal show isnt worth seeing unless you have children with you - pretty tacky and lacking in interesting animals and information. Plenty of eateries and other entertainment to keep you amused but don't plan to be there for more than a couple of hours.
,,Night safari,5.0,,This safari was fantastic the best thing we riding Singapore. We were so close to the animals and most importantly they seemed very happy in their environment.
,,"If thought the zoo was great, wait to you experience the night safari",5.0,,"I really loved the zoo during the day, but the night safari was even better. Wasn't planning on checking this out but was convinced by fellow travellers. So glad I did. One if the highlights of the trip."
,,Must see,5.0,,"We went to the zoo few weeks before and it was a good experience, it was hot and humid, some rain, and we got to see most of the animals..,
Compared to the daytime experience, the night Safari is much shorter since we only rode the tram, but we saw more animals in the 60 minutes at night compared to 5 hours during the day

Even though they are labeled differently, night safari is the same as the zoo,

if I am to do it again, I would just do the night safari

We started our tour around 9 pm after dinner and show, all the lines were pretty much gone by then. Don't start early , you will be in line for an hour or more"
,,Went above & beyond,5.0,,"I'm very slow uploading this review - we were actually there January 2014. My sister made the booking but was travelling with no internet or email access so didn't receive the zoo's email asking her to confirm our booking... So, we arrived on the night only to be told our booking had been cancelled as they hadn't heard from us - we were devastated as that was to be our Singapore highlight! BUT lucky for us the manager on duty (I want to say his name was Ron?) saw it upon himself to take myself, my sister & her husband on the safari - on a private little golf cart! His knowledge of all the animals and exhibits was fantastic, he explained how the zoo very conservation based & all about education & he even gave us some free toys from the gift store after the tour! The highlight was definitely being able to feed 2 of the elephants - we'd hold out bananas & apples and they'd pluck them from out hands with their trunks! Also loved when we drove through the non-fenced exhibits where the animals are able to roam about & across the track we were on - incredible experience all round!"
,,Fun with the family,4.0,,"I went with my husband and teenage daughter. It came highly recommended by a friend who lives in Singapore. We loved the shows and the animals were cool. Don't miss the Bat House!
It's a bit out of the way and we found the best way for us to get there and back was by taxi which added to the price. Also it's not cheap so I would recommend getting there when they open to get your money's worth."
,,Plenty of nocturnal animals to view !,5.0,,"We went here with a tour company so we were lucky to escape the long queues for the night safari train. It was VERY humid however the attraction has very large ceiling fans over the queue's. The train is completely open except for doors and roof (I think) so we could see and hear all the night animals. The only one we didn't see was a tiger. Some of the animals come very close to the train which is exciting. The ride takes around 30-40 minutes and well worth it. We also went on a small walking trail to see the night deer and a few other small creatures. There is a performance twice every evening in a largish amphitheatre which was quite funny and interesting and entertaining. Everyone speaks English, the staff are very friendly and there are plenty of food places and bathrooms-definitely recommend BUT only if you go as part of a tour otherwise be prepared for very long queue's."
,,Something unique in visiting a zoo,5.0,,"The basic idea is to take a tour of the zoo when it has grown dark, so you can see some of the nocturnal animals in their more natural habitat. So you see some of the big cats prowling around. The most interesting animal I saw was the ""flying fox"" (as some call it)."
,,...its one of Programme of Singapore Zoo,5.0,,"Real thrill of roaming into the jungle through the walk trail in night (Night Safari), make it plan to have Night Safari in the evening after having dinner at the zoo inside and spend with the wildest animals."
,,Good but expensive,4.0,,"It was a Good experience to see the animals at night time....even though the place was well maintained, I felt it was too expensive."
,,You have to do it!!!!!!!,5.0,,It's an activity that anyone who comes to Singapore has to do it.It's great.Even by mini train even on foot.It's placed very close to the Zoo and the River Safari.Have a great day.
,,Awesome experience for all ages.,5.0,,"Very organized trip. Reasonably priced, considering there is hotel pick up and drop off we opted to get the option without the dinner. Our tour guide was very approachable and pleasant. The safari itself was an experience. Exotic animals, and great creatures of the night show,

The tour was wonderful. The experience of seeing the animals up close and in their habitat at night when they are more awake was great. A completely different experience than visiting a regular zoo. The tram ride around the animals was just so interesting - so many of the animals we had never heard of so to see them, naturally, at night was amazing."
,,Fun evening,4.0,,"The facility is clean and entertaining. We especially enjoyed the hyenas and bats. The tram ride brings you closer to the larger animals- elephants and lions. As a group of adults, I was a little afraid we might get bored, but actually it was a really fun way to spend the evening."
,,Had a Blast!,5.0,,We went twice............... Going back the second time for a night time visit. Simply a must for anyone who loves to visit Zoo's Also nothing better than getting a Ben and Jerry's ice cream on the way out
,,Family fun place but expensive,4.0,,Highly crowded place to visit for. The good thing is the specific show timings which for sure should not be missed. The tram rides are approximately for 40-45 mins however the views are very dark and very difficult to see the animals. Found the safari charges also expensive.
,,Waste of time,2.0,,"There is nothing out of this world in this Night Safari. They have a few acres of contoured land with segregated pockets with different animals deputed to reserve their seats. As for us visitors, you need to queue up for atleast 1 hour, and ideally since 2 hours in advance to be able to get in at the opening time of 7:15 and hop on to the first tram ride.

Talking about the tram ride, its a chirpy, squeeky, noisy vehicle where you sit to travel around for around 20 minutes where the driver continues to ride once started and the guide is in perfect sync with the driver's pace to go on and on with a drafted speech in their Sin-glish Accent subdued or rather lost in the vehicles sound, they are absolutely carefree whether or not the so called patrons follow what they are trying to say.

These are those 30 second photo-stops where one animal after another just goes by and after a while, you figure out that neither did you get decent photographs nor did you actually realize it any earlier to just keep the camera aside and atleast see them and finally, the tram ride is over and you are into a rush to vacate so that the next set of guests can board the tram after a tiring wait.

If watching animals is something you like, having a leisurely walk at the zoo would be a better option."
,,too dark! can't see anything!,2.0,,the only fun thing is the show at specific timing so be sure not to miss it.. the ride and the views are all so dark and u can't really see clearly what r the animals in front of you. save this money for the bird park or the zoo!
,,Family fun and educational,4.0,,"I booked this attraction as part of a tour package which was definitely worth the hotel pick up and priority tram boarding, meaning we could skip the lines and enjoy the guided tram tour immediately upon arrival. It's truly a different experience to see nocturnal animals when they are most active. Plenty of animals feeding and roaming about. My children both under 10 enjoyed the ""fire"" show with the Thumbuakar ""warriors"". Do NOT go in thinking that this is as dramatic as what you might see in Hawaii as entertainment at a luau. It's just enough to keep the kids at this age entertained for 15 minutes. We also attended the Creatures of the Night show. The audience was diverse and the lead showman did a great job drawing laughs from the crowd. The highlights were really the well trained animals and a great message to mind our environment and reuse, reduce and recycle."
,,what a waste of time and money,1.0,,"Maybe I have got it wrong but to me a 'night safari' implies that you are going to see nocturnal animals. So after buying our timed ticket which wasn't due for another 30 minutes and then just walking in at any old time as that is what everyone else was doing we then joined the disneyesque cattle queue to get on an over full tram to basically see cattle, sheep, goats, deer and pigs. Yes there were a few lions, tigers and bears but nothing that you presumably could not see during the day at the zoo across the road.The only reason why they were up was that there was food in front of them.
So my advice, if you want to see normal zoo animals go across the road during the day time. If you absolutely have to go here forget about the tram just go on the walking trail (or wait until about 9pm when there was no queue for the tram) at least this way you get to see a few genuinely nocturnal animals such as bats flying around up close.
Also for a place that has brilliant public transport it really is a bit of a hassle getting there by mrt and then bus..come on guys a few signs to the nearest bus stop when you come out of the mrt would be helpful"
,,Too dark,3.0,,Thought this would be a fun trip but you really couldn't see the animals that well. Wouldn't go again but the people were great!
,,wonderful experience,5.0,,"this was my first visit to singapore for 2 weeks and amongst some other places, the singapore zoo stands out in my memory. we so thoroughly enjoyed the place. its kept so clean. The animals, the trainers, the animal shows, all are just out of the world. feeding the birds was a very beautiful experience, the night safari was the most mesmerising experience. it was my first time and I was truly awestruck. The best thing is that all animals are given their natural habitat and yet it is completey safe and friendly. the animals are all so well kept and fed and treated with respect and dignity. The dolphin show was marvellous. Overall its a must must must visit place. I assure you , you will love it!!"
,,A complete adventure!,3.0,,"A bit overpriced, but if you love the night, animals and the zoo this is a great combo! The guides tell lovely and interresting stories."
,,"Great collection of night creatures, Beware of long queues",3.0,,"Night Safari has some rare collection of animals. Loved their show :Creatures of Night"". Although there was a long queue for tram. They could most definitely work on their system of entry. It is unreasonable to make people stand for hour on entry gate."
,,Jungle time,4.0,,"A must do when in Singapore. Animals are, it appears, kept as well as they could be in if in confinement. Clean, tidy and pleasant, well organised, wide range of continents represented."
,,OK,4.0,,"Very good tour to get you close up to a lot of different animals in a short time, and especially during feeding times in the evening. But avoid the ""show"". Total waste of time. Spend your time walking along the trails instead."
,,Good but a LONG line,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari and were surprised by the very long line to get in then the long line for the tram but it might be because it's close to Spring Festival. Really enjoyed the views from both the tram and walking. You see some different parts with each. No issues with walking. The paths are lit but if you don't see well at night, this would not be good for you. Enjoyed how close the animals were for viewing."
,,Not as good as I expected,3.0,,"The reviews for this were so high. I'm glad I went so that I know what I would have missed, but there were many other things I would have rather done. It was a very long and hot evening comprised mostly of standing in line with tons of crowds. It's seriously a get in line so that you can proceed to the next line sort of thing. Blistering hot and not a lot of ways to escape the heat or rest while standing in the many lines. Super cool concept. The animals weren't easily visible (pretty sure they were also quite hot). I can't imagine keeping my kids awake for this and standing in all these lines. I was sadly underwhelmed. Wanted to love it....didn't."
,,Night safari a unique experience,4.0,,"The easiest way to reach the Zoo is by taxi and is about 30 minutes drive from the city. You can also go by bus or by MRT (North-South Red line) and then a connection bus or cab. The Singapore Attractions Express shuttle operates from designated places in the city. If you use MRT for returning, please make sure that you take a bus on time to catch the last MRT train. Last MRT from Ang Mo Kio is at 11.30pm.

We did Singapore Zoo during day time and waited for the night safari. If you do it on the same day, you can save on taxi. Besides, you get combo tickets also. For people who feel that it is too much of zoo for a day and night and if you have enough time, you can split it into two days. The Night Safari is open from 7.15pm until 12pm.

We were there on a holiday. So, the queues were long, entrance was so crowded and the waiting was too long. There is a food court next to the entrance, which we saw to be packed. A ‘Thumbuakar’ performance is held next to the entrance. We enjoyed it while waiting in the queue for the gate to open. Those who come late will miss this performance.

The Park is divided into seven zones namely, Himalayan Foothills, Indian Subcontinent, Equatorial Africa, Indo-Malayan Region, Asian Riverine Forests, Nepalese River Valley and Burmese Hillside. The park has a special area for small critters, like reptiles. You can either take the tram ride with English commentary or the four walking trails. As this is a ride to see the nocturnal animals, the whole area is dimly lit and you will have to watch very closely to see these animals. Even though the animals are not in cages as in a zoo, you cannot say they are in their natural habitat. However, you can see them moving around as in the wild. All of them were active during night. The walking trails are very interesting and it was lovely watching the animals so close at night. Some of the animals you can see are the lions, tigers, elephants, deer, antelopes, hyenas, giraffes, zebras, hippopotami, rhinoceros, wolves, tapirs etc.

Later in the evening there’s a Creatures of the Night Show in the amphitheatre. The first show is at 7.30pm and later shows every after that until the last show at 10.30pm. Make sure to reach there well before time to ensure seating.

Carry a map when you are doing the ‘walking trail’. It’s quite a large place, so it’s better you reach early so that you cover the entire area within the safari timings. It’s really difficult to get good photographs because of the dim light and flash photography is prohibited.

There are restaurants located outside the main entrance. Zebra Café inside the park offers refreshment and snacks.

Overall the night safari is not to be missed out as it’s a unique opportunity to see the animals at night."
,,Wonderful Experience With a Difference,5.0,,"If you are wanting to get a different perspective on a Zoo visit, this is the experience for you.
We purchased tickets online as a park hopper deal with the Singapore Zoo and as a result the tickets allowed immediate entry as those purchased at the park are timed entry and you may have to wait to enter.
Food options are good although you may want to have an early meal or come back well before closing as a pit-stop to avoid missing out due to food venues closing before park close.
Take the tram early to find the layout of the park and then you are free to explore the park on foot through the well signed and lighted paths. Much better opportunity to photograph the animals so you can relax and enjoy the tram without feeling you need to take photos and videos.
The animal show is well worth it so make sure you don't miss that especially if you are traveling with children.

We did both the Zoo and Night Safari (yes these are different parks) on the same day which made for a long day. You may wish to spread your visit if doing both, over multiple days. You have 7 days to use the park hopper once activated but this only allows each park to be visited once.

Transport was easy with MRT to Ang Mo Kio station and follow signs to bus 138 which departs every 15 minutes to and from the Zoo. Last bus is clearly sign posted so you should not miss it if you plan to travel by public transport."
,,Disappointing - poor views,2.0,,"Taking the tram wasn't necessary. We took the entire tram ride and didn't see very much. When it finished, we walked around and saw far more. It's simply a visit to the zoo at night."
,,Amazing experience.,5.0,,"We visited on a friday night and to be honest the organisation was chaotic, but it was a friday night and very busy. Food choice was fairly good with several eating areas, food price was reasonable. The safari however is a magical experience. You travel through the park and see the animals in natural environments and they seemed happy and relaxed. There is also an informative commentary. A brilliant experience and would definately recommend it."
,,A unique experince,4.0,,The Night safari in Singapore Zoo one of a kind experience. open at 1900hrs suggest to ready for queue if you are not a member. The tram ride will be a long queue if you are not a member of the Singapore Zoo. Suggest when arrive take up the walking trail first then later part come back for the tram. If want take picture is no flash light so latest iPhone won't capture good image. Need a real good camera for those who like to have the photo in the night
,,Awesome Experience; Wild Animals Look Friendly!!,5.0,,"It was very nice experience, though standing in the queue for the Tram ride is a bit painful however it is worth every penny you pay.

Also the Fire Show is really amazing.

Try catching the first rows of the tram & the fire show you can click some great pictures however No FLASH photography allowed!!"
,,Unless you have kids....,1.0,,"I went based recommendation of 2 co-workers and I was disappointed. Nice that it was cool out so waiting over 1hour in the tram line wasn't torturous. However, the loading of the tram was inefficient plus multiple attempts to make tourists get their pictures taken slowed the process more. I felt bad for the resting animals as the kids were excited and screaming on top of their lungs everytime they saw the animals. Also many tourists decided that the half-hearted muttering of employees to turn off the flash was a suggestion only...Good activity if you have kids but if you've been to a large zoo before, it's nothing too exciting"
,,Take your pillow .,1.0,,"One of the biggest mistake I make to come and see this night safari , there is nothing to see , you can do and see in normal daylight zoo much better , If you insist to come , bring your pillow with you ."
,,A different experince.,5.0,,Name itself suggest that you will see animals at night or after sun completely gone below the horizon. You will be riding on tram with lots of tourist. Photography is no no. As animals gets disturb by flash light. You can club with dinner also. There is show performance by locals . You will enjoy. there is fish Spa too.
,,Excellent one of a kind experience,4.0,,The Night safari in Singapore Zoo one of a kind experience. I would rate it as one of the top things to do in Singapore. The Night safari was well organized....The night safari had a good commentary accompanied with it. We could see lot of animals in there night life....
,,Animals so close!,4.0,,"Our trip to get to the zoo involved 2 different bus rides in peak traffic so it was long. Our guide was entertaining during the journey. Upon arriving there were so many people. We didn't have much time to eat the buffet dinner (which was the package we chose), food was average. However, our guide took us to the eating area and collected us from there which was helpful due to the number of people. Would recommend booking rather than just turning up as organised groups are given preference. The 40 minute tram ride to view the animals was great. Animals so close. That experience was amazing! Choose to watch the fire show, that was also great. Two different bus rides to get back to our hotel and a late night for our young children but they loved it."
,,Entertaining.,5.0,,"It is entertaining, however i enjoyed the daytime zoo trip even more as we saw a more variety of animals during the day. Please be prepared for the huge crowd. Some visitors tend to be rude but the zoo staff are exceptionally helpful and organized. It is a must to use a good amount of mosquito repellant. The night creature show is enertaining and lively. Unfortunately we could see the fire show due to windy conditions. Otherwise this is a good activity and one of the best night safaris ive been to date."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"The safari is really cool, similar to the one in Chiang Mai. Take the time to watch the show as it's great!"
,,Truly Excellent,5.0,,"A ''must do'' for young and old ! A really magical trip on the road train in the artificial moonlight . Also an entertaining session watching the animal show in the amphitheatre . This was my fourth visit to the Night Safari , and I'm still not tired of it.

We had planned our visit as follows : Taxi after early lunch to Zoo from Raffles City hotel ( hassle free travel option ) . Zoo exploration all afternoon till 6 p.m. closing time . Eat at one of the many food outlets outside the Zoo's main gates . Walk the very short distance to the Night Safari , to get there at opening time . Go straight to the amphitheatre near the entrance for the first show ( thus avoiding the initial long queues for the Night Safari road train ) .Only then take the Night Safari road train , since the queue for this by now much shorter . It all went as planned .... though it'll be a long time before I forgive my partner for eating a KFC at 6 p.m. rather than anything more interesting ! Taxis were easily obtainable for trip back to hotel

Night Safari ? Do it ! Do it !"
,,Lots of fun for an evening activity,4.0,,Well worth going but I'd suggest going with a pre-booked tour group to make sure you get the most out of it.
,,Busy and just average,3.0,,This is really just a zoo with a train to move you around the animals in the dark. It was quite busy and the queues to board were quite bad. The fire eating performance was worth seeing. Good venue for kids. Couples not so much.
,,Night safari,4.0,,Night safari was really enjoyable walking through the park is a lot better to see the animals rather than going round in the tram. There were plenty of taxis outside park so getting back to our hotel wasn't a problem.
,,Just Fantastic!!!!,5.0,,I have no worda to deacribe it. Simply great and a must visit if u are going singapore. 1.Great animals in their natural habitat 2.Fire shows 3.greenery n what not
,,Night Safari Tour with SH Tours part of AsiaTours.,1.0,,"We were extremely unhappy with this tour and I would not recommend anyone book this tour and possibly any other with Asia Tours. After the Tour I sent the email copied below and the company did not even bother responding to me.

Subject: Night Safari Tour with SH Tours

Dear Madam/Sir

My family and I have just returned from the Night Safari Tour we embarked today at 18:00, and I thought I would write you an email of our experience and disappointment of the experience we have had of your company's tour.

Firstly, your tour guide was not friendly at all. From the time of meeting we were just merely numbers on her list. In fact she allocated numbers to us (which I found strange because that is so impersonal). I can't tell you what her and is as she never introduced herself to us.

Secondly, we paid your company $59 per person and we are a family of 5. So this was a tour we were willing to pay money for but in return we had an expectation of a relaxing evening with the family.

It turned out anything but relaxing. From the time we departed your tour guide insisted that we rushed off the bus as soon as we departed, that we not stop for any bathroom stops etc. we headed the call with an understanding that as a group we cannot waste too much time.

But really it was a complete rush from one event at the night safari event to the next. We did not manage to even go to the bathroom. We just managed to buy some ice cream cups and were at the coach at 9:15. Since we couldn't eat on the bus the tour guide advised us to eat up (and not in a good tone). Actually the tone was extremely pushy and irritable.

I told my family that we have 15 mins as we were told that we were going to depart at 9:30. But a few minutes after we got at the coach your tour guide was screaming and performing for us to hurry up.

There were a couple of other passengers who got there at 9:27 and was scolded for being late. At which point at least 3 passenger groups started complaining of the treatment of your tour guide's behavior and attitude towards your patrons. She then advised that the bus is not allowed to stop for long periods as it is just a pick up zone and in fact that she was doing us a favour by getting the coach to stop at the parking bay marked Number 3!

After the altercation with the passengers your tour guides response was that if we were unhappy we should arrange to go visiting the night safari by ourselves!

I ask you why the bus arriving too many minutes too early be an issue we should be burdened by? Is this really what your company represents- that we we feel we are not treated well then we can choose not to use your company and make our way there ourselves?

It is very unlikely that we will be using your company again. It's just a pity that our 1st day in your beautiful country has left is feeling soo unwelcome. We have just arrived from 2 weeks in Vietnam and Cambodia and got the friendliest most awesome service and I suppose we were presumptuous in thinking that we could expect the same or better service in Singapore.

For what it's worth, I write to you hoping that other visitors to Singapore will not experience what we did.

Regards"
,,Very unforgettable experience highly recommend,4.0,,"Waiting time for lines was long so I was not expecting much by the time we boarded, luckily I was pleasantly surprised. You get to be pretty close to the animals and can see them very clearly. The safari went for a while as well so it didn't feel like a quick ride for the amount of money you pay. I would recommend this for anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Interesting experience,5.0,,Very informative and interesting. Recommend doing with a tour. Is slightly more expensive but you skip all the queues. We went during peak time and it was well run. Good family outing.
,,"Decent zoo, great idea using night to see all activity",4.0,,Of options at zoo this this is best one. The animal activity definitely picks up in evening and you have option to either walk or ride tram It can get crowded but what isn't in Singapore
,,Different!!,5.0,,"You first go and choose whether you want to go on foot or by tram, we chose tram its a 45 minute ride, you pass by all the exhibits and it was very unique i liked it a lot. Also 2 shows are there for free, a fire show and an animal show which i saw very very very interesting.. Certainly a must!"
,,I don't reccomand it,3.0,,Because the safary is done in the night you don't see too much of animals. you better choos the day tour. the only spectacular thing is that the animals ar not keept behind any fence.
,,Rainy night view,4.0,,I was unsure whether they will open on rainy night. But they started journey timely and view was good. The view would be more clear and exciting if weather were clear.
,,Animals in night and free,4.0,,"all the animals are moving freely. you have to sit in a train which takes you through the jungle and shows all the animals. it is followed by aa animal show.you can not take photographs as it is dark and the vehicle is moving and you can not use flash as it hurts the animals.
So just sit in the train relax and watch the animals in natural habitat."
,,A bit of a let down,3.0,,"We visited this place a week ago on a very crowded night. We only got to see the animals through the tram ride, and it was a bit disappointing as the lighting was somewhat dim, and some animals were covered by bushes and trees. Best to spend more time here by taking the walking trails. There are some interesting souvenir shops for those looking for gifts for friends and children. The food and drinks are a bit pricey though, especially the beers."
,,Well worth the trip,4.0,,"This trip was recommended by a friend and I think it would appeal to anyone who likes animals. We were collected from our hotel and transferred to another coach who took us straight into the safari park. Dinner was included and buffet style and then onto a tram that takes you around the park in the dark. Expect to see lots of deer of different kinds, as well as elephants, giraffe, lions and tigers as you are taken around the semi-lit park. There is also a fire show and creatures of the night show well worth watching. Lovely evening out."
,,Too crowded,4.0,,"Avoid all other zoo attraction to make time for this...
Be on way before time because there will be a very long line waiting to enter...
If you are little late you have to wait another hour to entet...
Show are great... i liked the one at the entrance plaza at 8:00."
,,The Zoo is more interesting at night,5.0,,Love how the entire zoo is laid out at night. Check out the show times before you go wander about in the zoo. Most of the animals are more active at night and it is also not hot.
,,Too crowded,3.0,,"We visited it on 30th Dec and even with the tickets just the enterance took more than hr. We were told to do tram later as it was too crowded.. took the walking trail and caught the tram at station 3 as kids were tired of walking. They had fun watching the animals but by the time we reached the show it was already full.
I wish they had kept more shows to cater to everyone since it was overly crowded.
Secondly since kids wanted to see the animals again we went on tram which we caught at 10 30 and the animals weren't even visible as they had all gone quite far, so whoever was on the tram for the first time sadly, didn't get to see most wild life.
Wish they would limit their availability of tickets."
,,Great time!,5.0,,"We did this as part of a tour. It's great because the animals are all out being their nocturnal selves, but you can see them clearly because it's about 3 times as bright as a full moon night."
,,Depens on the guide !!,2.0,,Been here twice and can say your experience depends on how engaging your tour guide is .. a good place to visit with kids
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We left on the express bus at 6.00pm from the Suntec Hub with our 3 event Singapore Pass purchased from the visitor centre in Orchard Rd - well worth it as the lady Joanna gave us a great run down on Singapore and places to visit. Following her guidance we arrived at the zoo about 6.45pm to get our show our pass and get our Safari tickets for the 7.30 Night Safari. Well, there was no crowd control slow ticketting and we waited in line till 7.25pm with very frustrated patrons. We missed the 7.30 Creatures of the Night Show and had to wait till 8.30pm! The Night Safar was packed with less than adequate crowd so we had something to eat. The Night Show was Kaotic lacking crowd control again! after the show at about 9.00pm we went to the trams for the Night Safari, queing for 45mins and finally on board! The Safari trip was great but the drawn out waiting to get there was not. Finally we left at 10.45pm on our journey back to the hotel by bus and train and arrived around 11.55pm. A long night for a popular attraction."
,,Better than a normal zoo,5.0,,The night safari is something you must do when in Singapore. A lot of animals at a zoo (any zoo) are most active at night. So the zoo comes alive with the animals out and about
,,Night is not long enough to see everything,4.0,,"This is a good attraction especially for young ones who love animals. The main problem is the night is not long enough to see everything. To make the most of the outing, try to get here by 6:45pm.

The number 138 bus trip from Ang Mo Kio MRT to the safari takes about 1 hour due to peak hour traffic so allow plenty of time for the journey if you choose this way to travel. Once inside the gates, there is a long queue to get on the ""tram"" that goes around the park.

The creatures of the night show after the tram ride is a highlight."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"The 4 of us did the night safari with dfinner included.
Wewere given dinner in the dining room at the zoo and the meal was excellant.
After dinner we boarded a small road train for a night tour of the zoo.
The guide was well informed about all the animals we saw.
All in all a good night trip well worth doing.
Brian Leonard"
,,One time watch,3.0,,"During my trip, I didn't get a chance to see many animals. About this safari, Main Entry Gate opens from 7 pm but entrance starts from 6:40 pm or if you are late, you get long 'Q' line/s. At the main entrance gate, you'll see fire show (not if raining) which starts between 7 to 7.15 pm. and then there is a creature show starts from 7:30 pm.
If you love to see all animals, then you should see first creature show and then take a walk in the Zoo with the help of map (available with any crew) but walk only if you are not scarred from darkness. And don't forget to take umbrella & low light torch as there will be no light or very low light, at certain points crew will there to guide you.
After a walk you can go for short tram ride to see animals (if you are lucky). Remember you can't take photo with flash so if you wish to take photo, ensure you camera can take photo without flash in the night. Ticket cost is 42 for adult & 28 SGD for child but I recommend to buy tickets from online as you'll good discount."
,,Well worth a Visit - but beware of the RUDENESS,4.0,,"The Night Zoo Safari is well worth a visit - but again Singapore has introduced variable pricing - for tourists the entrance fee including tram ride is $SG42 each.

Singapore Zoo is easy to get to by public transport - take the Metro on the red North south line to ANG MO KIO and then transfer to the bus at the bus Interchange - bus No 138 - whihc runs every 10 - 15 minutes until 00 15 hours (after the night zoo closes). The cost of the metro/bus is included in the in Singapore public transport card.

Try to get to the Zoo early and get a ticket for a 19 15 entrance - entry times are 19 15, 20 15, 21 15.
There are many venues to eat at- e.g Bongo Burgers which is Ok
At the night zoo - do not miss the Creatures of the Night display - at 19 30, 20 30, 21 30.

We arrived for 19 15 entry and made our way to see the initial Creatures of the Night show and then made over to catch the tram for the trip around the zoo.
BEWARE of the pushing, shoving and overall rudeness - and the mass of people trying to board the trams - one of our party was verbally abused and shoved by a group of Indian tourists and told to ""get out of the way"" - be prepared. Staff try their best but some visitors can be extremely RUDE

The tram travels around the various enclosures inside the enclosures where the animals are close by - there is an opportunity to get out and walk around to see the lions/tigers before re-boarding another tram

When we visited we got entry for 19 15 - joined the huge queue - and then visited the 19 30 Creatures of the Night show and the the tram tour after that - aprrox. 20 15 the queues were huge and as stated earlier pushing, shoving and rudeness. The trip around the park was aver an hour with a stop to see the lions/tigers. At the end of the tram ride there is an opportunity to see the Wallaby Park - but as Aussies we have seen plenty of these at home.

We finished our visit by 22 30 - and only had to wait for less than 5 minutes for the bus back to ANG MO KIO to catch the Metro back to town"
,,Very good shows,4.0,,"the place was very nice with a adventurous look. You can actually see animals roaming around freely when you are in tram.

The shows that take place are innovative and nice. The only thing bad about it is reaching here is difficult as it is at some distance from city."
,,Loved all the animals and the Creatures of the Night show!,5.0,,"First of all, we came on a SUNDAY. A human tsunami. A day so packed with people and Thaipusam on top of it all! So because of the traffic due to the blocked roads, when we got there the queue was miles long. We booked through the hostel and the rate was 10SGD cheaper than online. The self ticket redemption part was a bit tricky because there were only TWO machines and when one would falter, the other would be working, and it just went on like that. My partner and I had to queue in both lines because of these faulty machines.

Of course by the time we entered, the tram ride line was sooo long so we walked ALL the foot trails which was fun and not too crowded. Rangers were really nice and helpful especially the guy near the Sloth Bears. He advised us to finish all the trails first, then do the tram later. After the trails, we decided to watch the 9.30pm Creatures Of The Night show which is not to be missed!!! It was just about half an hour and the animals were really well trained. Jeremy, our host was very well-spoken and funny, the binturong and otters were absolutely adorable! After that, we did the tram ride which was awesome, just wish the giraffe came closer. Some of these animals are not nocturnal I think because they were definitely sleeping.

Only downside is that it is horribly difficult to take pictures with phones and cameras at night. Especially with no flash allowed. Next time we will do the Singapore Zoo instead! We just about made it to the second last SAEX bus before it left (10SGD return trip)."
,,A fun evening out although it was a little cheesy.,4.0,,"This was the second time I have done the night safari. The first time I was eight years old and to this day, I have remembered it fondly. Nearly 20 years later, it was still fun but I was definitely more aware of how cheesy it was. I did the tram ride as well as the night show. It was fun and would be great for children and families but being a older I didn't appreciate it the same way I did as a child. I could be wrong regarding this but I felt there were less animals in the zoo this time. I didn't do the wallaby trail coming from Australia and growing up with wallabies in my back yard it didn't particularly interest me and it was getting late but it is possible there are more animals hidden down there.

Overall, it was a fun night out and would be great for children and families."
,,Hard to see anything,3.0,,"Not really worth the money, a lot of deer and pigs with a few other animals thrown in. Very difficult to see anything and you can't use your flash to take photos. If you do go, use a tour company because the queues for the tram are ridiculously long and you will get to jump this if in a tour group."
,,Ok but did not live up to the hype!,3.0,,"Everyone we told that we were visiting Singapore said ""you must do the night zoo!""
Whilst everything was well organised and we had an enjoyable evening it simply did not live up to the hype. The highlight of the evening was the tram ride. A 40 minute ride where you see lots of animals (elephants, Tigers, lions, etc) but of course only fleetingly as you drive by. The Creatures of the Night show was fun and humorous but again nothing special. Overall a good experience."
,,Nice outing in the cool of the evening,4.0,,"had visited the sister parks in our earlier visit, so we thought we try the Night safari. The animals show was nice, but was pretty difficult to find the rest of the animals at night! Nevertheless we enjoyed it because we enjoyed the cooler weather (after sunset) and the fun of being together in a dark jungle, telling jokes!

the souvenir shops were fun too"
,,Way better than daytime zoo!,5.0,,"You really get some thrills seeing the animals in their habitat as if they were free! The sensation is amazing. The most frightening are the hyenas and, depending on you, the big bats, which can fly freely around you, in a contained area. Even if it's hard to take a picture, it's about the experience itself. Recommended!!"
,,Have a good time there,4.0,,"For very first day of our arrival we visited this place. It is a good idea that upon arrival you take a good rest and in evening head toward night safari. It was a week day, it was crowded for 7.30 batch. But by 9pm we could see that there was hardly anybody. Please note that if you missed the fire show upon reaching there say at 7.45, no issue, just take night safari tour and catch next fire show at 8.45. It is outside ticketed area. Tour in itself is good. You generally watch all animals. That alone in jungle in night feel was there. Our kids were getting a little scared at times. But they had good fun."
,,Excellent way to escape the urban jungle,4.0,,"I had high hopes for the night safari after hearing the raving reviews from friends and co-workers. Long story short: it was good, but was short of amazingly good.

Firstly, kudos the the management and crew at the night safari. Top notch maintenance, attitude, love for animals, passion and patient to explain. Superb people! Don't fret that you may lose your way or unsure which trail to take, there will always be someone ready to help!

Overall the park is well laid out so it's difficult to lose your way. A little advice to anyone interested would be to purchase the tickets online (you get to immediately enter, and avoid queueing and purchasing on the spot), enjoy some discounts and most importantly, give you more time for a leisurely stroll. Ask when the feeding time is for the tiger etc, which helps to time your walk around the safari.

One absolute must is the train/tram ride. This ride unlocks certain areas of the park that's not accessible via foot. Must do this! If I had to re-do, try to get seats in the middle. Too far front, you sometimes get blind-sides by the time the animals are spotted by the guide (and you don't get much time to admire the creatures before the train moves on); too far back, you may not see the funny expressions the guide makes (or hear clearly enough).

So the only slight disappointment was the creatures of the night were not too active when I was there, and quite Abit of renovation on-going, and bumped into some unruly folks who uses flash photography! DO NOT USE FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY!

Have fun! It's really a nice way to escape the urban jungle!"
,,Good buffet dinner,5.0,,Went to Ulu Ulu restaurant for dinner and surprised to find sufficient vegetarian options along with Indian dishes. Ample choice of dessert and I would strongly recommend the yam ice cream (purple color)

,,Most disappointing and expensive Singapore activity,1.0,,"We chose to use the bus from the safari gate to travel to the night safari. It was stormy, traffic was slow so we arrived just in time to enter. There was no guidance as to what to do, just huge lines moving forward. We ended up on the live for your groups and had to go all the way to the back again.

Once through the turnstiles, another huge line for the tram. The show was cancelled due to the weather. In all it took us close to an hour to get on the tram, again dealing with people trying to push their way further up the line.

The tram trip was ok, lots of looking at very little and the passing by some animals, but really too quickly to go more than glimpse them.

We then walked around the trails, again lots of nothing. Quite a few enclosures were too dark to see anything and in others the animals were hiding. Can have a much better experience at zoos in other cities.

Shows were running by this time, but we're always full, and the last one was too late for the safari gate bus. So missed out. Finished the night with an overpriced drink.

Returning on the safari gate bus was an experience. Open air double decker, which seemed to drive too fast and totally impractical on a stormy night.

It felt like the zoo has massively oversold tickets and were unable to deal with the crowds. Given the tickets are timed, they should only be selling tickets up to the amount of people they can reasonably deal with. The entry staff were rude and unhelpful.

This is the most overpriced and worst experience in Singapore."
,,Over-Rated Tourist Attractions,2.0,,"Honestly, i went to Night Safari two times. Both were not satisfying. We didn't really many animals there. So dark."
,,A unique experience to see animals in their natural habitat,4.0,,"You get to see some species not displayed in the Zoo (Simba Lion for e.g), that to in the natural habitat. A nice experience."
,,Wild Animals,5.0,,"I went to Night Safari with my family, It was a one of a kind experience, yes its dark there and you will ride a vehicle which will take you to the wild animals up close, you might get a little nervous for the vehicle is not caged and you probably think the animals can attack you at any given time, but no. its safe! one thing, you might want to switch your lights off the camera and video's because they only allow you to use it in night vision because the animals might get distracted with the lights after that you will get to see an animal show that's really fun! you can also go for a fish spa massage after, photos and collectibles awaits before you head home buy something. I actually want to go back again some time soon. go and get to experience this!"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"My adult son and I both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The zoo is accessible by train and bus. We took a train to Ang Mo Kio and then bus No.138 at Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange. Although the bus trip was quite long (about 30minutes) but we did not mind it since the air conditioning in the bus was nice and we just used the time to relax and recover from our busy day. We used our tourist pass and redeemed our tickets at the zoo, which was easy and fast. The queue to board the safari was quite long, but it moved along quite reasonably.
The night we went on the safari, we saw groups of different animals and we were amazed how close we were to the animals. They were literally just an arm length away from us. It was great to see animals were active and alert. The performance at the entrance was great too. We only had time to do a small section of the walking trail. When we finisnhed, we took an express couch outside the zoo to the city, it took 25 minutes and costed $5.00 per person."
,,New experience,4.0,,"The safari starts at around 7.15, people starts queuing up before and hour. If you go on weekday it will be better. Night safari is guided tour of about 45 mins in a tram and there are 3-4 walking trails also. But if you go to zoo and safari on same day there are hardly any chances that you will be having any energy left for walking trails. There are deers and few other animals which roam freely while you pass by. Its was a new experience for us."
,,"Good, but maybe I had high expectations!",3.0,,"We went to the Zoo, thinking of amazing and scary safaris, water and land based,

What we eventually got was a 10 min boat ride on a placid water body, saw 2 giraffes, 2 elephants and a large expanse of water. This was called the river safari. A total ripoff for 40RM per head, i expected a lot more, but like i said maybe- I had high expectations.

Never mind, with a fresh outlook, we awaited the night safari. we experienced the Thumbakum fire dance- which was entertaining for 5 mins, and then emitted a lot of kerosene based effluents in the air, not to mention the smoke pollution. Sat in our trams for 30 mins, and saw the animals- in their habitats, placid and happy.

I guess the main thing about the Zoo, it was really clean, but animals wise, i dont know, i guess i have seen more- more White tigers, more elephants, more deer, more bears etc.

It was an Ok experience!"
,,Awesome experience but i preferred the zoo!,4.0,,"We did the Night Safari after the Zoo all day as it is next door, but to be honest we saw more at the zoo, the concept is great if you only have the night to visit the animals as you see quite a lot, but if you have the time i would recommend the zoo over the night safari"
,,Did Not Expect to Be So Cool,5.0,,"I was greatly impressed upon visiting the Night Safari. It took me a long while to finally go there since I got such mixed reviews from a number of people about it - some say that all of the animals are sleeping so you don't see much while many others said it is incredible. A friend of mine from out of town visited and we said ""let's do it"" on a weekday night.

There was surprisingly no line and we went straight on the tram with fairly few people on it. It was already pretty late but you still get to see SO MANY animals - I was baffled at how they were able to keep so many wild and dangerous animals contained the way they do. It almost appears that everything is open for the animals to run loose, but in reality it's perfectly safe for us! We loved it and came away with some incredible memories.

We used Uber to get all the way out there and back which made it really easy. I would highly recommend if you have some spare time towards the later evening!"
,,Different Type Of Zoo!,4.0,,"First off, be sure to come here having already eaten dinner as the food prices outside the Night Safari are crazy expensive and at least 4 times more expensive than a local hawker centre.

Anyways, be sure to start queuing up early around 6:45pm as the queue will start to build up fast. There is a fire breathing show on the left of the queue line around 7:15pm so be sure to check that out! When the doors of the park open, instead of heading for the tram ride, I recommend to go for the night safari show instead on the right. After that you can head for the tram as it will be less busy. Be sure to take the tram as there are certain animals you cannot see just by walking. The tram ride itself is maybe 20 minutes long and for certain animal exhibits, there is no barrier between the tram and the animals so some animals are very close to you. After the tram ride, be sure to walk the 3 different trails to see some more animals which you cannot see while on the tram. I managed to see a lion up close through a glass panel. Most of the animals are active and despite it being dark, they still can be seen. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Night Safari!,4.0,,"Its actually not a night safari, its just a buggy ride in the open zoo at night. But kudos to the management for showcasing it as night safari, its a unique and worthy experience which is not there in most of the parts of the world. The animals are actually posing for you in their natural habitat, u can even find some passing by your vehicle. The place was jam packed as we visited in the month of December Christmas break. Their are additional shows there viz. fire dance, amphitheater animal stunts etc....worth a visit especially on the day you arrive in singapore, if u visit the city as tourists by early morning flight."
,,Get to see the animals 'up close',4.0,,"Singapore Zoo is designed with the intention of wanting to give visitors an experience (and illusion) that you're so close to the animals you could reach out and touch them (you obviously can't), but it makes for a great, realistic experience; add the element of nightfall and you're in for a real thrill.

The night safari starts with a tram-type ride through zoo grounds, narrated by the rangers on the animals you encounter and the reason for their various significances. Once done, you're on your own for a walk at your own pace along a similar trail, with various education reading points so you know what you are staring at in the thick shrub.

You'll be bombarded by Tour Operators offering skip the line or VIP tickets to get you going quicker: provided you haven't caught the zoo on a particular school excursion day, the queues move quickly so the VIP tickets are unnecessary. In the Tram, ensure your camera flash is off - not only is it highly harmful to the wildlife, it also makes for an unpleasant public telling off via the loudspeaker if you're caught flashing away. When walking on foot, don't rush and be cautious of your footing. You'll find zoo guides along the way to ensure you are following the right paths and guide you across the busy tram way paths. If traveling with kids, keep them close - it can be easy to get lost in the mass of snaking roads, pathways and junctions if you're not paying attention to the signage."
,,Line after line.....,2.0,,"We were on our honeymoon and it was actually my 3rd time in Singapore. On my first visit, I visited the night safari with my best friend and I love animals so I decided to visit there with my husband. There's different times that you can book 7:30pm, 8:30pm, and 9:30pm. We got there at around 6:30pm and had to line up to get in because the gate doesn't open till 7:15pm. I just don't remember lining up 7 years ago but that's alright we lined up to get in. at 7:15pm, there was the fire show in front of the entrance, but with me being not so tall person, I couldn't see any of it standing and there was only two performers (on the brochure there's 6) I know it's not always like that with difficulty finding staff all the time but that was out for me, I couldn't see it. So after going through the entrance, there's another line to go on the tram. We didn't really feel like lining up again, so we went and watched the creature show which was cute but very short probably about 15 minutes. So after the show, we ran to line up for the tram, but there were like 5 different tram stations for tour groups so we got a bit lost there but we were told to go to the one near the entrance on number one. When we got there, the line was massive and we again, lined up for about 20 minutes to get onto the tram and everyone was just using in.

When we finally got onto the tram, the ride was pleasant. It was different from all the other zoos and the ride went for around 45 minutes. There's a couple of trails where you can actually get off and walk around. We got off at one of them and walked around.

Overall, I don't recommend this if you don't want to line up. It's a different experience so some people might like it, but I just really didn't want to line up for that long (all together maybe I lined up for an hour). Maybe it was the busy season because I don't remember lining up last time!

Just be prepared to wait in a line if you go!! easy access to get there. taxis or buses."
,,Lines and lines!,2.0,,"We are 2 Aussies on our honeymoon and we are easy going so we just took it all casually, but for the effort there and lining up for ages at every little stage, it was a bit hot and troublesome and expensive for a Zoo trip. Better, easier and more comfy in other countries guys.
We opted for the night zoo, them you see a little show, cute, but nothing like SeaWorld, dream world shows, a lot smaller in excitement etc.

Eat elsewhere, quite expensive and nothing special, great for little kids but keep an eye pad handy to amuse them when you line up!

The major part of the night zoo ticket is a tram ride for 20 mins to see the night animals, that was cool, nice to not line up, but it's dark and the team doesn't stop, so you see them for 2 secs as you go by. Quite funny!

Average to be honest! They show a fire twirling thing as you arrive, the Chinese loved it, but we know Byron and Thailand and it's not anywhere near as good as that, as much as they worked hard and tried their best.
Skip it Westerners!"
,,Great night out,5.0,,From start to finish this was a very entertaining evening.Lots of animals to see on the night safari train about 45 mins ride.Plenty of places to eat and drink.Tbe fire show was vey good also the show before the ride.Great for kids.
,,Very Ordinary,2.0,,We completed the night zoo ride. Hard to see the animals at night. Commentary very boring and rehersed. If you don't see animals in nature this might be the go for you but otherwise cost a lot for little adventure.
,,Nocturnal wanderings!!,4.0,,Only spent a couple of hours here passing the time till our flight back to UK. Although a flying visit we managed to get round a fair bit of the park. A different experience from a day visit to the zoo. Feel we probably need to spend more time to fully enjoy the experience so would return.
,,The Best Exeperiance u can make it,5.0,,"Its different from any other zoo u visit before , the place was amazing . i book my ticket online and save some money because using mastercard , u must to go early because u will see amazing show before the gate open and i suggest to stay at left to see the show more close , when u enter the night safari i recommend to go right to see the show first before ride the train because after one hour the train will be empty , i take the train 3 times to enjoy the zoo , u need to ride the train one time on right and other to the left to see everything , i didn't enjoy the walking time a lot , take a water and small towel with u u will need it"
,,Seeing animals by night,5.0,,"This was actually a really good experience - we went on a Saturday evening and went straight to the tram, for which there was a bit of a queue but not too bad. It was really good to see the animals by night because they were up and moving around, and to be able to wander around the park with very few people in it. The park is well laid out and the animals look in good condition. The bat cage is particularly worth checking out, I have never seen such a large cage up close."
,,"Fantastic! Besides all the bad comments, I can only recommend",5.0,,"We prebooked the night safari tour online, as some of our friends recommended, that its a must do. Then I was reading the comments, and became very disappointed that we prepayed and booked. I did not want to go anymore, my boyfriend said, lets just not go, taxi fee going there and coming back + the disappointment, doesnt worth the prepaid entrance fee, Finally the concierge said to go ( although he managed to change our tickets for the zoo ticket, he still said he recommends the night safari)
The Night safari was amasing! The show was cute and entertaining and safari was fun. We enjoyed and can only recommend to everyone!"
,,Queue early!,4.0,,"This was our second visit to the Night Safari. We have now had breakfast with the Orangutans, done the River Safari and the Night Safari. We personally, enjoyed the Night Safari the most out of the three.
Just a tip, even though doors to the zoo do not open until 7:15pm we queued just after 6:30pm and there were already people there. It is a great zoo to visit if you have some time in Singapore!"
,,worth a revisit,4.0,,"fascinating way to see a zoo - at night.

I went on teh same tour years ago when it was just beginning - much larger and better now.

And they do control those who cannot control their camera flash .

Beware that catering closes before the zoo - so get that last minute drink before 9:30"
,,Not great and value for money not there,2.0,,"If you dont get to travel a lot and see animals in the wild, this would be a must see. The night tour is very rehursed and a bit boring. Hard to see the animals at night."
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"Not my first visit, but I'm always impressed by this zoo and the experience of seeing animals at night. Took public buses this time to get there and back to the hotel. Certainly takes longer than a tour bus or taxi because of the constant stopping. Make sure you take the ""bus"" inside the zoo all the way around as there are animals you don't see on the walking trails. Although there was a large queue for the zoo buses, the wait was no longer than 20mins."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Gotta experience this. Really, really cool! Up close and personal with the wildlife and in the dark too. Staring at the Tiger was pretty awesome, behind the glass, of course!"
,,SOmething one shouldnt miss while in SIngapore Zoo,4.0,,"This is no doubt a lifetime expereince one can experience seeing the animals in night being on tram. Yes it takes you once again inside zoo , but u will find different animals to see in their nocturnal activities. Must visit"
,,Nice and educational,4.0,,"The only downside of our trip was the long queue! It took us 2 hours to finally get in and ride the tram! But the tram ride was amazing, to see the zoo life at night! And it was educational too! We Learned interesting facts about animals.
Tip: pay little extra and take the fast track!"
,,"Queues, to join other queues.",2.0,,"This was right up my street - I love zoos and seeing animals.

We visited during peak holiday season on 30th December and were asked to book not just a date, but also a time, so we went for 8.30pm entry.

However when we arrived at 8.15pm we joined a queue for 8.30pm entrance which took around 40 mins to reach the outside gate, only to find we were queueing to join another queue for the safari tram, which was 2 hours long!

No chance - we were tired and jet lagged so decided to do the walking only tour which only had a 10min queue to pass the ticket barrier.

We walked the park, which was essentially like walking round a zoo with the lights off.

So disappointing. I don't understand how they allow it to get so busy before saying it's sold out."
,,Overcrowded... but fun!,2.0,,"We pre-purchased tickets on the website hoping to save time upon arrival. Unfortunately, we were completely mistaken. Our group of 6 adults waited in line for 1 hour and 45 minutes to board the tram. Singapore's hot and humid weather got the best of us an we were completely covered in sweat by the time we got on the tram.

The tram ride itself was very fun and well-done. The zoo appears to be working towards conservation efforts and makes an attempt to dissuade customers from purchasing ivory and other illegal animal parts. I commend them for highlighting conservation.

Tip: take the public bus to the night safari. Our taxi ride one-way from Orchard Road cost $36 USD. Buses do run to the Night Safari, and if you have the tourist pass, you should be able to use the bus as a part of the unlimited pass. We also really enjoyed the gelato they sell there while we waited in line.

From reading other reviews, it looks like you can purchase some sort of priority tram tickets and dinner packge. I would recommend trying to purchase these priority tram seats. Otherwise, the long wait was enough to make me never want to return. I can only imagine that waiting in a line with small children would be even more difficult. If you do choose to go, make sure you bring plenty of cold water and grab some gelato to get you through the line!"
,,Kids would love it!,5.0,,"One of the places where we visit all the time while in Singapore is the Zoo. During our last visit, we had plenty of time, therefore, we bought multi-attraction pass for all of the wild attractions in Singapore (including River Safari, zoo, night safari and bird park). During another visit, when we were submerged in universal studio most of the time, we only went to bird park. The reason is, you would find zoo in most of the city, but bird park is one of its kind attraction, with many shows. We usually plan our visit in terms of arrival time to the park, visiting birds and integrate it with the show timings."
,,An excellent visit,5.0,,"I want to start by saying that I have visited the night safari on many occasions from when I was a kid growing up in Singapore and as a returning Singaporean since moving abroad 10 years ago.

The night safari is an excellent example of the unique entertainment that Singapore provides! The experience with the animals is intimate and if one is takes the time to read the information at each exhibit, the experience is also extremely educational.

The tram ride is also fantastic, it allows for ensured viewing of all exhibits from a different perspective.

As the night safari is a very popular attraction, understandably the place gets very crowded. I stood in line waiting for the tram ride for an extended duration. Whilst this is expected during peak times, the issue was that the waiting lanes were easily compromised with people letting their ""friends"" in from the sides. Please note that this only affects the section leading up to the section divided by railing which is also supervised by staff.

Another issue is the use of flash photography. It is clearly indicated everywhere that flash photography is prohibited. Constant reminders from staff aboard the tram ride is evident. However, some people insist on using their flash. It is difficult to enforce this at all exhibits especially along the walking trails, but I believe this needs to be strictly enforced where possible. Particularly on the tram ride where I have unfortunately been present where the constant use of flash photography by one individual resulted in several exhibits being skipped in order to reach a safe location for the animals so that a stern word could be had with the culprit.

However, overall, the night safari is a fantastic experience that I would gladly visit again!"
,,"Interesting to experience, but details cannot be seen in the dark",4.0,,"It was a first time for us to go to a night zoo. We were quite interested in it and it does give you a completely different view on the animals. Also the noises you hear are really cool. Yet the problem is simply that it is dark at night and so it is difficult to see details and it may be boring for kids.

Consider taking the ""Japanese Entrance"". The explanations on the train are no matter whether in Japanese or English not particularly detailed and the waiting time for the train tour was only 10min for us. This entrance that is mainly reserved for Japanese tours is right next to ulu ulu restaurant."
,,Thrilling ride,5.0,,Good for children... Its so scary lion nly at 100 m distance.. It was followed by indian cuisine dinner.. Tasty food...
,,Long Queues!,3.0,,"We had no idea we would have to wait so long in the queue before boarding a tram to see the Night Safari. We had a long, long wait made worse by the fumes which really made us feel very, very unwell. Not really sure where they were coming from, but an overwhelming smell of petrol/diesel fumes is not a good way to start.

The ride itself was interesting, although some of the animals didn't want to come out and be seen,to be fair, not that many, and the most interesting, the tiger, elephants and lions did."
,,very impressed!,5.0,,"really enjoyed it- show was interesting, tram ride was great and not too busy and the walks were good too. definately recommended!"
,,This tour is very boring if you're a group of adults.,2.0,,"I'm not sure what we were expecting, but this was terrible. The tram moves a little fast and the animal enclosures are poorly lit. We could barely make out the animals before we were moving on to the next. You can stop and walk the trails but our guide was very hard to understand so we missed the midpoint trails. I don't think it would have made it any more enjoyable. It's just a few inactive animals in small, poorly lit spaces. It's far from the city and the taxi is more than admission. Way too expensive for what it is. Bottom line, avoid unless you're with kids."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"My wife and I joined the Viator tour with priority tram boarding at Night Safari and a buffet dinner in the zoo. With the tour, we had a great dinner at the zoo with buffet style and were able to skip the long line directly to tram ride. The animals were not caged, so they looked happy and active. We were able to catch a fire show after the tram ride and a short walking tour."
,,Exceptional close encounters with animals,5.0,,The night safari was well organised despite the Christmas rush. The long queue was tiring but worth it. Couple with young children try to avoid holiday crowd. Don't do zoo visit and night safari on same day
,,a kid in me,5.0,,"it brings me back the memory of my childhood, nice experience to see wildlife so close, i love the program at the end of the educational tour inside, so much fun to see animals that can follow instruction or direction! the place is quite far but a worth it experience"
,,First amazing open zoo experience,5.0,,"Our friend booked this tour online for us. Got some discount! We went there easily by public transport (MRT and bus). It was really cool the see the animals such close distance. It was the first time for me. Although it was not peak time or something, we had to wait for a while but no problems. There are food counter in case you're hungry or want to grab something to eat while waiting. Our guide was really knowledgable and humorous. The night tour was well organized. You can stop in the middle and go around to discover the open space then you can come back to catch their train later on. We missed the two white tigers. I guess they go to bed so early now, no need to hunt at night because they are fed so well now. Just need to watch out the time a bit because if it's too late, there would be no public transport to get back to your hotel (last bus at 11:00pm i think) You may have to take a taxi and it could be expensive.
Definitely come back in my next trip to Singapore."
,,Very great experience inside a huge natural parc in Singapore,4.0,,"We spent a very nice moment in the Night Safari. You are very close to every animal during the Night ! You can see THE hugest bat of the continent, Squirrel, Elephant, TIger, and other kind of animal I never saw before.
Very great experience for everyone - I recommend it"
,,Great night out!,5.0,,"We went on the Night Safari with a baby and two young children and arrived to a massive queue that snaked back to the entrance to the Singapore Zoo. Despite our fears of a decent wait, in true Singaporean-style, the staff managed to have the line continually moving and we were aboard the tram. Recommend getting to this attraction early, especially if you want dinner and show. We caught public transport, but would recommend booking on.line ahead of time as sessions book out early."
,,Fun filled night!,4.0,,"Definitely one of the ""must visit"" in Singapore. A nice and unique experience for all of us. Should be there by 8pm so you can explore more."
,,Great night out,4.0,,I booked this tour with Tour East. It was great. They picked me up from the hotel and we had a nice buffet dinner. Then saw the tribal show which had lots of flame effects. The tram ride was cool. It was great to see the animals and that care was taken not to disturb them. It was a little annoying that afterwards I felt rushed to get back to the tour bus so I had to quickly buy my safari souvenir without being able to have a look around the gift shop properly. But I still thoroughly enjoyed the night.
,,Over hyped place,3.0,,A good place to visit when in Singapore . But never go on a day like X'Mas it was so crowded that regret Visiting that place . Staff is not trained to huge crowds. Number tickets sold to visitors was far more than the park could handle . The place is good but the visitors mgmt was poor.
,,Not worth the effort!,2.0,,Spent the day at the zoo and then had to wait for this attraction to open 2 hours later. To get in we were herded like sheep and made to stand and wait in a queue before the gate was opened and people ran to get on the first tram to go around the safari. Poor signage meant it was hard to find where animals might be and it was hard to see in the dark anyway. The Creatures of the Night show was very lame and we had to queue up for 30 minutes to get in to it too! Would not waste your time here.
,,Best zoo ever,5.0,,Brought my Japanese friends with their young toddler son. Everyone loved it so much especially the Night Safari. They went for the day n night safari n totally enjoyed themselves watching the animals being fed etc.
,,So much to learn about animals of the night,4.0,,"This is my second visit to the Night Safari. One big tip, go late. The rush from the zoo clears and there is so much breathing space to watch everything keenly.
The Creatures of the Night show was good, and so was the fire dance.
A lot of animals are actually of Indian origin. Made me resolve to spend more time in the wild in India."
,,Novel but disappointing,3.0,,"The concept of this park is good but being at night lighting is poor and when traveling on tram animals are often difficult to see. Fire eaters are good as is creatures of the night show. Enjoyed the walking trails which allows time to see the animals however we did it as part of a tour so were on limited time and couldn't walk everything. Did on 3rd Jan and it was crazy busy. If not peak period would probably recommend doing it on your own. We're going to do the river safari but after doing this park, decided not to."
,,Great entertainment,4.0,,"We took a guided bus tour and we all enjoyed it.
We had time to catch the two shows that are also included. The places to eat - many restaurants/cuisines.
I would recommend this one esoecially if you have teenagers or younger children. You essentially get a safari type tour within the grounds getting to see especially the nocturnal animals from elephants, hippos, giraffe, hyenas and lets not forget the king of the jungle -a lions."
,,Nice but not for family with young kids,3.0,,Starts at nights. When the tram drive through sleeping animals . Young kids got sleepy. The animal show not bad interrupted by rain . Fire show at the entry good too. I would go again I will go without kids!!
,,Nice variation on the usual zoo experience,4.0,,"The most disconcerting aspect of this attraction is the mass queuing at the start of the experience. Once inside though, unless you really need to ride the tram just bypass the many hundreds of people lining up for it and head straight for the walking trails. We found these no trouble for our 8 year old and often shared the exhibits with very few people. The animals are reasonably active and the night time ambience along the modestly lit trails adds a nice feel to it all."
,,Shows were good,4.0,,We booked 7.15pm entry tickets online on the same day .I would advice to see all 3 shows first and then go for the tram ride coz show times are specific and tram rides are available at any time. Taxi availability is less as compared to other places. So go early and return early May be by 9.30pm .
,,Night safari tour,3.0,,"We visited in October 2015. We booked this before we left Australia. The pick up and transfer were well organised. I am glad we had a tour guide as the lines for the trams were horrendous, there was people everywhere and we were fast tracked onto a tram. We found the tram ride a waste of time to be honest, we saw very few animals. The meal we had which was part of our ticket was fantastic, with a range of food. We would not bother with this tour again ."
,,One of the best safari experience,5.0,,Firstly the way the night safari is conducted to great because there is dim lights so that animals can be seen but care is taken that they do not get disturbed. The variety of animals is really good and the place is maintained and organized.
,,Average,3.0,,"Our visit to the Night Zoo was underwhelming. The tram ride was nice but too quick to move on from points of interest. It is better to get off and walk around the trails. This place is good for young families but now we have been there, we won't be bothered again. The night experience is interesting but the zoo next door is better."
,,this did not live up to my expecations at all,3.0,,"Yes, it may be the first one in the world but it all seems so fake and staged. The animals were just sitting there and I felt it wasn't a natural evening. The cuecue was also too long
once you thought you were up there then the weave started again on the other side. The flame throwers were great!!! The journey in the tram is short for what you pay. there is no value in doing the night safari. I would not recommend this stop for family and friends."
,,Good experience,4.0,,"We visited during Christmas holidays and it was jam packed. There were many tourists along with many locals. Firstly there was a large bunch of people trying to get in after buying tickets ( best to buy online). Afterwards, we had to wait for about 90minutes for the tram ride. With small children it can be a little difficult. The tram ride lasted about half hour or so. After that we went on one of the walking trails which was quite enjoyable as you see the animals really up close. We heard and saw the tiger roar just a few feet away from us and it was amazing! There was a Animal show performed by the trainers every few minutes that was quite enjoyable too. There are many restaurants where you can eat and have a good time but I personally love the fresh juices you can get mostly all over singapore!"
,,Ok night out... Weather was not in our side!,3.0,,"Make sure you check the weather before committing to this tour. The heavens opened whilst we were there which made the train ride which is the main feature a challenge, and the other activities/attractions are all in the open. We managed to go for a walk between showers on both on the self-walk tours, but the organised shows were cancelled. It was also super busy. The advantage of going with an organised tour is that you get to 'jump the q' and are in the express lane to get on the train. If you are self touring you need to get there early."
,,Queuing was ridiculous,2.0,,We went on a night safari and could not believe the amount of queuing required with a pre purchased ticket. When I try to think about the experience without the queue I guess it was worth it. But the queuing left me feeling a little disgruntled as were many on the night. Queuing lasted several hours. Perhaps this may be different during the day.
,,must go for halloween period,4.0,,"must go for halloween period, more events and cosplayers for photo taking, much more exciting than the usually night tram!!"
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,This is a wonderful place. One of the few night safaris or zoos in the world. Get the tram ride. Its worth it. Nothing lime visiting a zoo at night
,,Only in Singapore lah,4.0,,"I always enjoy visiting this themed zoo, it's different from the regular ones. It opens at 6pm, after Singapore Zoo and River Safari closes. This is a must-not-miss attraction in Singapore."
,,Amazing nocturnal adventure...not to be missed!!,5.0,,Fantastic nocturnal adventure...extremely entertaining and educational. ..perfect for people of all ages. Information with a message...palpably surreal!
,,Great way to spend some family time,5.0,,"It was a great way to spend one of the evenings in Singapore.

However, it was very busy when we went and was overwhelming.

Make sure to spray yourself with BUG SPRAY if you are sensitive to bugs.

Recommendation, don't wait inline once you enter the park to hop onto the tram.

Walk all around towards the left to the other side of the park to take the tram back."
,,Overbooked and crowded,2.0,,It was more like a circus than a safari and fine if you don't mind crowds and mass catering. The animals were in a fairly natural setting with a commentary explaining things as an open sided train wound its way through the rain forest- a bit too contrived for me and I was glad I had taken a book to read.
,,Bad experience,3.0,,"We booked our ticket for 9.00 pm for night safari (train)had taken 6 kids with us. Reached at 8:30 P.M. and were asked to stand in a line . people who came around 9:30and had a ticket for 8.00 pm were allowed ahead of us. We reached the check point at 9:45pm . People were jumping the line . There was a massive argument and the staff was no were around to handle the situation.When they know that during holidays the crowd is more could have managed it better. Poor organization and time management. In the end the kids were tired and lost interest. They had lot of Asian animals , many of which we could not see . We have been to Steve Irwin's zoo which is way better than this one."
,,"Great way to do a zoo, especially for kids",4.0,,"The Night Safari lived up to our expectations - it was fun walking around discretely lit animals. The fire show was exciting, and the ""meet the critters"" show was also entertaining. The tram going through the zoo ran well, and was a welcome respite to having to walk all the way back from some of the more distant parts of the zoo. My 10 year-old enjoyed it more than my 13 year-old; it was not as captivating for teenagers. Nice concept, and did not disappoint."
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"We were here at Christmas night and there lots of people. You know people pushing and NOT lining up properly. Be prepared to get sweaty and sticky. As soon as we got the ride, me and my bro were excited. Its rare to see animals at night time. The weather was cool. Some animals like the deer, boars are just on the sidewalks. You could also skip lining up for the ride but instead do the walking tour (if you dont like queue)"
,,A nocturnal adventure,5.0,,"We visited with our three kids and they had a blast. I would skip the theatre show at the beginning though. The tram ride enables anyone to enjoy the safari without even getting off the tram. You can get off at various sections and wander on the marked trails. You can hear the lions roaring in the night, and you will drive right by tapirs laying right beside the tram trail."
,,Singapore Night Safari,4.0,,"The night safari was a great experience. The ""fire show"" before the safari tours was a most interesting display of ""fire breathing"" with appropriate music during the performance. The night tours were excellent with a great variety of jungle animal."
,,Must see !! Love the experience,5.0,,We pre booked the tickets online to get the discount and jump the ticket queue..the sessions are always packed.. The night creatures show was interesting and entertaining but little short in time compare to other animals shows..the tram ride it's a must !! There were lots of ppl queuing for the tram.. But the queue is consistently moving so it's very time efficient. The ride was mazing ..really takes you into the deep and you see close up of many animals..
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Excellent opportunity to observe jungle life at Night. Waiting time is a minus point as one gets tired in standing long ques with family , specially , feels like sleeping during Safari Ride. Animals are very well kept and watching King of the Jungle at night was the best moment."
,,Very interesting seeing animals at night!,5.0,,"We came as part of a cruise shore excursion. When we arrived there were long lines but they have a good system and they moved quickly onto the tram. The animals come alive at night, especially the tigers. There eyes become iridescent. Very spooky when they look at you. After the tram we did a walking tour, which gave another perspective. We spent 2 hours there. Enjoyed a lot. Very unique."
,,west time,1.0,,quite animals I codunt hear any one too far place and difficult to see clearly some of animals hidden camera cant shot because flash not allowed
,,Beautiful Experience,5.0,,Well worth the visit to see the animals at night. Very peaceful and tranquil. You never know what you will see in the dark.
,,New Experience,4.0,,"We are use to going to zoo's but this is an interesting place. You first start by going on a tram which takea you around the resort to see 80% of the animals with an english speaking guide giving you small i information about them.

Afterwords there is a small show and finally there are trails to walk to go around and see the rest of the animals. The only down side is that since the event is at night, taking photo's of the animals is impossible."
,,Very different way to see a zoo,4.0,,"We went because we had heard from a previous visitor that they had enjoyed this experience. It is a long way from central Singapore, though. We went with the ship's tour in a bus and then got on to the trams through the zoo and explored a little on our own as well. When we were done with exploring, we hopped on to another tram as it stopped in the area and this second time, we saw some animals awake that we had not previously seen. So it was a good move.
Not sure if the animals are naturally nocturnal or are kept awake with lights....??"
,,Good but beware of the queues!,3.0,,"Luckily for us we visited as part of an organised tour, meaning priority boarding for the safari, otherwise we would have had to wait for hours in the queue. I am not sure the 40 minute safari would have justified the wait.
As for the safari, it is good not brilliant. Worthy of a visit but we won't return. There is not a great range of animals on display, seen one deer you've seen them all. The lions and the elephants were good. It being night and flash photography not being allowed, it is difficult to take any decent photos. The shows were cancelled because of the rain. Nice choice of food outlets."
,,Poor customer service.,1.0,,"I understand how reviewing a place without actually visiting it seems unfair to the business, BUT given the unbelievable and disappointing customer service received the last two months I am surprised they even operate...

Made the first enquiry mid November to which I was given all the information and told 2-3 weeks time confirmation will be sent. I was excited so 2 weeks in to the enquiry I emailed, it was referred onwards and was told that it had not been 2-3 weeks as mentioned, our place was reserved. No payment details though
So i waited.
A month later I emailed again
I was already a little frustrated as I had tried organising everything before our holiday. Was informed that the 'rates' hadn't been confirmed / changes may have occurred... Next day I was given an email with the pricing, link to the site for general info. Request for deposit. Busy enjoying our last day in Phuket Thailand before we went on a trip into the national park I didn't respond.

During our holiday we have been away for a few days in the national park (5th-7th). No net. No phone. No hassles.
During this stay the safari emailed on the 6th titled FIRST FOLLOW UP. At this stage I should mention during my holiday I have an auto'out of office' email saying I am away. They wanted to hear from us within 48hours. So today I got an email titled GIVING UP BOOKING. We were told that 'due to the lack of confirmation' from our end... You're kidding me. We tried to organise this well and truly in advance. First come first served (their words). we were first come and... Left out to dry.

After two emails expressing my disappointment and intent to cancel, I then had to explain in another email that I had already written to them about if I wanted to continue or not with the booking.

Overall a pointless endeavour. Can't believe I considered spending $200 each at a place that can't even get their bookings and emailing customers right...

If you get over that obstacle I hear the safari is great"
,,Night Safari - what's with all the hype?,3.0,,"Everyone told us we HAD to do this as it is the best attraction in Singapore. The best night safari in the world. Well, it was OK. Could not see the animals very well, which was expected, but many of the nocturnal animals were not in good sight. The show was a little ordinary and full of fluff rather than actual animal presentations. The best part of the experience was the tour guide on the coach to and from the venue."
,,Interesting nocturnal zoo,3.0,,"This is an interesting concept. However, not all animals you see there are nocturnal animals. Many nocturnal animals are difficult to see at night with low visibility. Overall, this is a bit overrated."
,,Underwhelmed by the experience,2.0,,I was told to visit the night safari as it is a great experience but for me I couldn't really see anything throughout the night and not being able to take photos took some gloss away... The zoo for me is the better experience and with families taking photos with the animals is priceless experience and we can always look back.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"A nice way to spend an evening with kids. Lots of animals out at night, very interesting and unique way to visit a zoo. Start with trail walks to avoid crowds rushing to the show or the trams first. By the time we finished the trails we had no line for the tram. Highly recommended"
,,Amazing! So Cool!,5.0,,"This is the coolest zoo I have ever been to! You get to see so many animals and even get to go inside their enclosures if you hop off the tram to walk the Leopard Trail. They have some shows going on, but check the times since they end earlier in the night. I think the last fire show was at 8:45pm (ish) and the last animal show was around 10pm (ish). We went at 9pm and so we missed all of this, unfortunately. They have a tram that takes you around the different areas with large animals and then you can hop off the tram at the stops to go walk the smaller animal enclosures. This is totally worth it!! Look online for coupons. We got 15% off tickets using bemyguest.com."
,,A different experience but not sure whether seeing it at night is best,3.0,,A night only experience of seeing animals on the free. But could not convey the impact of a safari except for the fact that it was a night visit thing. The overall setting is however great which was very well capped with a great dinner
,,Unique safari,4.0,,"This attraction gives the opportunity to see a number of wild animals in a nocturnal setting. Visitors ride in an open trailer to view the animals which are lit by a clever artificial moonlight and penned behind cleverly concealed 'invisible' fences. We saw elephants, lion and rhino as well as many species of antelope and some smaller animals too. The included fire-eating and animal handling shows were of less interest to us but may appeal to younger families."
,,Must visit place at night time in Singapore,4.0,,"The Night Safari was pretty amazing and I recommend it as a place to visit for seeing exotic animals. We got to see some fire-breathing performers on our way inside the park. They were really amazing. The day we visited was when it seemed like whole singapore had come here. We had to wait for an hour in lane which was moving at the pace of a snail. When we reached the tram then it was all very good and the frustration of waiting for an hour was nullified. The animals are very very close in proximity to the tram. Plenty of wild animals to be in awe of, such as lions, tigers, leopards, rhinos, giraffes and more. They were out in the open air roaming and chilling, a little disheartening but also super cool. Some of the animals seemed to be posing for people. Wish we could take pictures, but it was too dark and no flash photography allowed. Such a great experience to visit late into the night. Very friendly(family friendly as well as date friendly). I loved it and so would you."
,,Be very very patient!,3.0,,"Firstly, it is in the middle of nowhere and not well served by public transport. A taxi from the CBD was $35. That was easy. Getting home at midnight was a nightmare. Few buses and a handful of taxis to deal with 100s of people leaving at the same time. Fortunately we got an Uber for $60.

We visited at night and waited in 2 lines for over 90 minutes even though we had pre purchased tickets on line. The exhibits were no better than the day in terms of seeing action and the facility looked old. There wasn't anywhere near the variety of animals that you would see at Sydney's Taronga zoo. However, the children noticed none of that and enjoyed it enormously and loved the night time atmosphere."
,,Experience Amazing,5.0,,"The Night Safari was a highlight for us during our trip. To be able to tour around in the night time on the tram cars and see the animals up close in their own environment was amazing. There is an opportunity to get off and walk around the tracks to get an up close view also, which we enjoyed, even in the steamy heat of the night. Put this on your to do list in Singapore"
,,Must-go for cat lovers,5.0,,"I was able to get really close to the big cats, see them, hear and them and even smell them. The whole park is smartly designed so it's totally safe while you could watch your favourite animals within a close distance. Would be very romantic to take a walk with your loved ones. I would come back to enjoy another cooling night breeze with my husband.

(These pictures are taken by phone only)"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Our family loved the night safari. Something different about a zoo experience at night - it felt like more of an adventure, more thrilling.

There are four walking path areas where you follow a paved path past and through animal enclosures. The animals are all nocturnal so are most but not in all cases active. Each Area and exhibit has dim lighting and once your eyes adjust you can them well.

There is a ride on open sided team which weaves through the park driving past many exhibits but this is not so fun as walking yourself, because the tram moves fast and you don't always get to see thing as well as you like plus the tram has an annoying voice commentary which for me s bit patronising. Still it's a good thing to do to get a overview of the park.

Get there early as some exhibits are active shortly after the park opens and you can easily spend 3-4 hours doing it properly.

The show was fun for kids - Disney style which suited them."
,,Must see when you go to Singapore!,5.0,,"I have never experienced a zoo during night time! The night safari opens around 7:30 PM, so you will go through a zoo while it is dark. Some animals are more active at night so that makes it a nice experience! They have a bustour that shows a big part of the zoo but for some parts you have to walk."
,,"Would do again, but",4.0,,"We really enjoyed the night safai. We unfortunately went on a weekend and the line and way to enter the park was long and difficult. Once you are in, you should allow time to take the tram around the park, since this is the only way to see some of the animals. We did this near the end to rest our feet. We were told and found that if as you walk around to the various animal enclosures, if you show paiience you will see more animals and have a much more rewarding experience."
,,Not great,2.0,,"Disappointed with our trip to the Night Safari which was a highly anticipated excursion on our holiday. Booked an 8:15 session and arrived 1/2 hour earlier in case of any queues. Well we queued for 1.5 hours to get to the ticket booth and then a further half hour to get on a tram!! Everyone cheered when each tram moved off - don't think it was excitement at seeing the animals..

This delay meant we didn't get to see the shows, try the walking tours or feeding of the animals as we'd run out of time.

The larger animals also seemed bored - it's difficult to make out the enclosure size / stimulants - in the dark but their behaviour left us a bit worried.

When we asked our children (7 & 9) if they enjoyed it they said it was good but not worth the 2 hour wait for a 30 minute ride.

Possibly due to the time of year we went but ticket sales should have been limited to avoid the chaos."
,,Not really worth going,2.0,,"Personally I love the day Zoo very much and is proud of our Zoo, but went to Night Safari I was disappointed as maybe it was just luck as did not see much animals and sitting the tramp does not really see anything."
,,Our second trip to the Night Safari was uneventful,3.0,,"This was our second trip to the night safari after many years. Unfortunately, this this trip was not eventful. Arriving near 6:30 when the night safari gates opened, we waited and waited and waited on line for the first of three trams (7:30, 8:30 and 9:30). We saw tour groups cutting the lines forming their own special lines, so maybe coming with a tour group is worthwhile? While one can do a walking tour by themselves, we opted only for the tram tour because we were pretty tired. Unfortunately, we were unable to see many animals clearly. My recommendations: explore the park early (soon after opening) by yourselves, then take the tram tour later to avoid the crowds awaiting the tram tour."
,,A great perspective,4.0,,"I loved seeing the animals at night, it really was something different. It's very difficult to get photos though, and no flash is allowed so leave the camera at home. Make sure you take the tram, you see animals you can't see by walking and the commentary is so interesting. If you start by walking and do the tram later, you can beat the queues to get in."
,,Not worth the price,3.0,,"We were gifted three tickets so our group only had to pay for one. $45 per head is just too much for this in my opinion. The tram ride isn't very long and most of the animals you could see during the day as well. Elephants, lions, rhinos, lots of deer... I always enjoy seeing animals but I wish we would've done a regular zoo visit instead."
,,Terribly Crowded Place,3.0,,Went with lot of enthusiasm but everything collapsed due to heavy crowd. Not worth going with very young kids...........
,,Unique experience,4.0,,This is an unique experience. Was able to see animals in every spot. The wait was very long and huge queues. They should limit the no. of tickets based on the capacity they can handle.
,,"far far away, not worth the travel",2.0,,"far far away, not worth the travel. nothing much to see there, especially it's at night and the animals are sleeping across the river to your car."
,,Great outing,5.0,,"Definitely would do this again. Allow yourself enough time to do all the tracks and the night show. Night show was fantasic. We went through a tour group, which was great as we got to skip lines as it is extremely busy here at night, but the tour group only allows enough time for one walking track, shuttle bus and the night show. Would have loved time to do all walking tracks. Great set up though, amazing how close you feel to animals such as lions, hyenas,ect."
,,Skip the tram at the beginning and take your time,5.0,,"We had a park hopper ticket so we were able to get in right when it opened (if you buy your own ticket they will give you a timed entry). We got in the big line to get in and then decided to do the walk around first (as you get to skip the line). At first there were a ton of people walking around with us too and then it thinned out till we were the only people at most of the animals. We took our time going through and really enjoyed watching animals we don't get to see be active. Most people who walked the park seemed to be rushing through the park so fast they didn't see anything, while it appeared that the majority of people just took the team and then left. We loved walking around even more than the tram (which we did after). Overall it was a great zoo and I loved the concept!"
,,Nice and innovative. Good experience,5.0,,It's really a new experience which can be experience only in singapore as most of the wild life parks closes early evening whereas here we can see animals in close distance even the wildlife animals.
,,Interestiing Zoo,4.0,,We visited the night Zoo which was good atmosphere and interesting in the sense that you are able to go in the dark by foot or cart to see a lot of nocturnal animals with no fences that separates you from them but there was also a lot of queuing up which took a lot of time. Half the time spent in the zoo was queuing up and waiting.
,,Terrible experience,1.0,,"The Night Safari opens at 7pm. The queue started forming at 6pm after the River Safari (which was very good). After an hour of standing in the queue a fire twirling show started to the right but could not see anything due to the crowds or would lose place in the queue. At 7pm the queue started shuffling forwards very slowly like herds of cattle between barriers. It was a further 50 minutes before we got on a tram. It was full of either very noisy excited /tired children or young babies screaming. The ""tram"" which was not a proper tram but open coaches on wheels takes about 40 minutes to drive around. It does not stop when animals are spotted but keeps on going , plus you can barely see anything in the dim lighting anyway. The worst experience in Singapore! Felt very sorry for the older people queuing for over 2 hours with tired kids. Maybe if tickets were sold in advance with a set time would make it slightly better> We did expect it to be busy being December but it was ridiculous and not worth all the aggravation,"
,,Definitely not a must see in SIN,2.0,,We went because of the high ratings at trip advisor but we didn't like it at all. First of all the ride is way too far from the center. Second there's nothing really stunning to see there. Third the show is not good. Fourth they try to teach you to be good to the environment but take pictures of you and then print them all out whether you buy it or not. That's a way of wasting natural resources! So the hole thing doesn't convince me.
,,Good - not great.,4.0,,We loved the Singapore Zoo last time we came to Singapore so thought to do the Night Safari. It was good to see the animals at night but was not as good as we had hoped. It may have been because it was so busy the night we were there.
,,Safari Night,5.0,,Nice place to bond with your kids. You can be transported in a tram to see the nocturnal animals freely roaming around the area. You can also walk in different trails to have a closer look at the animals.
,,Great experience but horrible organisation,4.0,,"The night safari itself was interesting and we were provided with a clear commentary in the tram. Although, it began to rain quite heavily and although they had pull-down ""Windows"" to protect the passengers, it was impossible to see through them and the tram became very muggy once the shades were down. In addition, the line to enter the safari itself was absolutely ridiculous as we were squashed against other people for over 45 minutes in the hot Singapore weather. There was no order or organisation to this process and was extremely frustatiing."
,,Good night out but take a tour option,4.0,,"We went on the night tour on recommendation of our travel agent, with the specific advice to take a tour to avoid queues for the trams, which, as we now know, are huge.

The bus picked us up from our hotel and we waited at some back storage area ( which was a bit weird) for the other guests to arrive and away we went.

The tour guide explained the programme and the option of getting a meal while at the zoo, from one of the many eateries.

We opted to take the tram ride first and then walk and see the night show after.

The tram ride was informative and we got to see heaps of animals we hadn't seen before, which was cool.

As we got off the tram the night show was starting to fill so we took a seat on the right side of the seating area near the end of the row. Unfortunately we couldn't see what was happening on the waterfall, so try to get a central seat to get a better view.

The show was fun and well presented and worth seeing.

The self guided walks are well laid out and we got to see all the animals without being rushed.

We decided to eat back at the hotel afterwards, so didn't partake in the food, but we didn't really have time anyway.

Others on our tour had a buffet meal somewhere at the zoo and commented they didn't have time to see much.

It was a great night out and I will be taking the kids back next time we are in Singapore."
,,Not very good value for money,3.0,,"we lined up with what felt like a million indian toursits off a bus trip. They were all very vocal and rude, pushing in in front of us, it was extremely hot, we waited nearly 2 hours to get on one of the open air buses to take us around. Quite frankly, there was not much at all to see. We were very disappointed, but the highlight was the open top double decker bus trip on the way back - which we organised ourselves,nothing to do with the safari. Would not recommend."
,,Mixed experience,3.0,,"Having read many previous reviews and talked to people who've been on this attraction we decided to go for it on a brief stopover holiday. We booked the tickets on line and printed them out beforehand. All the 7.15PM entry tickets had gone so we got the 8.15PM entry. The crowds that other reviewers mention are indeed huge, and so busy that we avoided the tram ride altogether. Instead we did the walking trails (much quieter) and loved it. I wouldn't want to put people off visiting because seeing animals like this is wonderful but if you do go, be prepared for serious queues!!"
,,Unique and fun activity for the whole family,5.0,,"I had been to night safaris before in other cities, so I didn't think this would be much different. I was wrong! This is a really unique experience and well worth the trip it takes to get there. Especially fun for families with kids."
,,Absolute chaos,2.0,,Our tickets were booked for 8.15pm. We arrived at 7.45pm. We were shunted from one queue to another for 90 minutes. The actual tram lasted 40 minutes but the 1 and a half hour wait definately didn't cheer us up. The guide spoke English but not clearly enough so we missed alot. They had no customer service ethic. There was no apologies and we were thrown together in queues that had no system or logic. Terrible. A waste of money and time.
,,Great experience - a must do,5.0,,"We went here just after the New Year while enjoying a few days in Singapore. We booked through the local operator, which is recommended, as you will bypass the crowds and long lines of people. The tours goes from your Hotel ton the venue and last about 4 hours that includes a walk, tram tour and night creature show. Value for money is great on this tour. You can also have a meal as an extra cost. The animals you see and learn about are so interesting. Highly recommended for all ages."
,,Night Safari,1.0,,Worst experience of a zoo ever. Could not see a thing. Waited for trams forever. Will try during the day.
,,Excellent,4.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari was one of the highlights of our recent trip here in Singapore. The queue can be very slow as they clear the crowd through which was one of the annoying part. Highlight was the entrance to African Savannah when you approach giraffe, oryx and zebra enclosure. The lake was breathtaking. The tram service is another low point as we waited 40 mins while multiple trams came by without room to pick us up."
,,Trip to night safari,3.0,,"Night safari used to be hugely recommended. Our first visit was about 10 years ago. It is far from the city so give yourself about 30 minutes or so. If the party is about 4 definitely take a taxi (approximate fare would be 20- 25 dollars.
The crowd was huge. A word of advice would be either book online or if visiting the zooo or bird park before get a multicday park hopper ticket. This would save a lot of time.
My suggestion is to take food with you as there is precious little time. If possible grab the night creature show and then go for the tram ride. If lucky you will finish around 10 pm and can see the fire show. The tram ride is Ok most animals are deers, types of Buffalo etc. The interesting animals were the lion, tiger and elephant. Hardly any body takesd the walking trails in thenight
On the way out there were plentiful taxis."
,,"Too crowded, too expensive.",1.0,,"Terrible part of my holiday! Too many people in the lines, expensive and long waits.
There really needs to be more of a focus on crowd control. This would have made it a pleasant experience. If you have children or are elderly or don't like crowds this would not be fun for you. There were hundreds of people waiting at least an hour in a long winding line and people were pushing past you and trying to cut through the line.

You go there after the zoo day trip.This was good fun to begin with as we entered there was a large crowd watching fire breathers and dancers, we then watched the live animal show, although the presenter was interpreting to people who speak different languages not to use flashes on the camera, people still were.

After the massive line up you then wait for the carts to collect you and the go for a 25 minuter drive around the parka and look at all of the animals, where you can finally relax after that hectic line up. The driver commentates as to what animals your are driving past. That is great to see the elephants, lions and many many other animals.

An idea maybe upon entry is that they could put a voice over on the speakers in different languages to not use flashes and to not push through the lines."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Awesome experience we had. Total out of the world. Worth every penny. Food and drinks are available inside the location.
,,Wasting lots of time,1.0,,"In the same day, I planned to visit the Singapore zoo in the daytime and visited the Night Safari at night. I bought my ticket to Night Safari in the morning at the Singapore zoo. The earliest entry time is 7:15 p.m.. But this time slot is sold out. So the next time slot is 8:15p.m..
The nightmare starts, I queue up at 7:30p.m. for entrance. When I finally step into the park, it was 8:30p.m., then you need to wait for the tram, the whole trip of the tram is about 45 minutes, the tram will bring you to visit different kinds of animals. I spent another hour to wait for the tram. The staff will suggest you to go to the walk trails first then you can come back for shorter queue. Don't trust them, after an hour the queue did not change, and you cannot see the large animals in the walk trails.
Finally, I took the tram and watched a night show. That's it. The time now is 11:15 p.m. You need to spend another hour to wait for the taxi. When I arrived my hotel, the time was 12:30p.m.
If you visit the Singapore zoo, you don't need to visit the Night Safari because the animals are similar. If you really want to see animals at night, I recommend you to visit the Night Zoo at Ching Mai, Thailand. Join the local tour there? You can see and feed the animals in more comfortable way."
,,Had such an amazing time at the Night Safari!!,5.0,,"The highlight was definitely being taken on the carriages and having being told what to look out for. Very informative, and fun facts about the animals. It was great to stop and go for walk along paths too. Night Safari is definitely worth going, for the experience- you will no doubt have lots of fun!"
,,"Good activity for the family, and a nice change from the typical day time zoo",5.0,,"Make sure you are early to catch the performance at the start of the safari. It can be pretty crowded so you would like to be the first bunch to catch it can continue on with the rest of the visit.

We took the train tour which took us around the entire safari with an audio guide explaining the sights and exhibits. As this is a zoo for nocturnal animals, some sections are not lit and can be quite dark. If you have children who are afraid of the dark you may want to be prepared.

You can get off the train at intervals to explore the various walkabouts. My favourite was the bat aviary where you can have a close encounter with these mysterious mammals. Some occupants are very large and you can literally come face-to-face with them. Not recommended for the faint hearted.

The safari is located right next to the zoo so if you have the energy, you could start at the zoo during the day and hop over to the safari around 6pm to continue."
,,A must do for singapore,5.0,,"The theatre show was a bit amateurish but fun nontheless. The. Safari is close up to many animals. I did the zoo and was held ransom to eat at one of the fast food places while I waited for the safari to start. With singapores cheap transport and proximity, there's no real advantage to doing both at one visit. Both worth visiting. Safari is seated so if you've had a big walking day, you'll get good bang for buck to finish your day here."
,,little disappointing,2.0,,"went with much expectations only to walk away disappointed. the highlight was the fire show at the entrance. maybe i misunderstood the concept of this zoo. i was expecting singapore zoo at night. expecting to see lions, tigers, pandas etc at night. none. best i could see were a few elephants doing what they do in daylight. the eco show was ok. go to day zoo if you want to see animals"
,,Great night time activity if you are on a business trip,3.0,,"Good night time activity to do after work with colleagues. You can get a taxi here for a relatively cheap price even if you leave from the center of town. The food available is decent if a little over priced.

The experience itself is good fun, you are placed on a safari like jeep and driven around the zoo to see the animals roaming around. You will see all types of animals and lots of beautiful scenery.

My only issue is the incredibly long queue to get on to one of the jeeps in the first place. Need to do some work on the system to make it a little quicker, potentially arrival slots or some such measure.

A decent attraction for an evenings adventure in Singapore."
,,Pretty cool but make sure you plan your route and get there early!,4.0,,My girlfriend and I visited the night safari after reading some reviews on it. Even after buying the ticket we were unsure of whether to go or not. After some route planning we decided to go. We had to jump on two buses to get there where we encountered cues before getting on both of them. When we eventually got to the night safari the cue was huge getting inside and then once we were inside we spent the majority of time cueing to get on the night safari bus and to get into the live show. As we only had a couple of hours before the last bus back we ended up running around the zoo Gavin a quick scout at whatever we could which turned out quite fun! I'd only recommend this attraction for people who have some spare time in Singapore and haven't been to many zoos before. If you have visited a few zoos before maybe give this one a miss!
,,Must limit numbers,2.0,,"Our experience was this: - originally went along on 28 Dec 2016 with our 6 year old twin boys. We were all enthusiastic to have what seems to be a pretty unique experience. Our slot was 8.15 pm and we arrived at 7.45. Walking the whole attraction was not an option with our children, although we planned to perhaps walk a bit. The queue was already substantial but seemed reasonable until we got in it and it just did not move. The weather was rainy and the fire show had to be cut short. What we saw was pretty entertaining. Myself and the children went over to see it while my husband stayed in the line. No movement at all for 30 mins and no information. Impatient and tired children everywhere. No queue control , no information. The excitement wore off, the enthusiasm wore off, we became frazzled and the children especially were bored. Eventually, after 50 mins we reached the barrier to be told it was another hour ! to reach the front of the tram queue. We made the decision to cut the visit short and return home for the sake of our children. We complained to the front desk and asked for a refund given the state of near chaos and lack of information which had been available. Our children were dead on their feet. We were told no refunds given but two options - 1. Go to top of queue right away that night (no way, pleasure gone by then) or 2. Get a re -validated ticket for another 10 days with fast track this time to go straight to front of tram queue. We took the latter. The evening had been ruined with a S$45 return taxi ride for our trouble. The customer service person was very efficient and pleasant however and salvaged the situation a bit for us. We returned on 30 Dec. 2015. We got in straight away and skipped a queue which this time was at least DOUBLE what it had been 2 nights previous! It looked like a complete nightmare with small bored, tired and confused children and frazzled depressed looking parents and other adults set for what could be a 2 - 3 hour wait in the humid evening !!!! No attraction anywhere worth that, all pleasure sucked from the actual experience. Thank goodness we got in quickly. The safari is excellent, very atmospheric and with interesting animals and commentary. No one got off tram to wander though for fear of losing team place. Due to the volume of visitors the tram was a bit rushed. The whole experience tainted by the volume of visitors and tickets sold which seemed to us just unnecessary and greedy. If you are near a 10 .30 pm finish, you then also have a huge wait for return transport if you don't have a car. S$120 aprox plus transport to queue with the associated anxiety and unhappy children. DONT DO IT - unless 1. Go off peak / quiet time (when that is I do not know, as taxi driver said always like that!) or 2. Pay extra for fast track tram ticket. 3. You like queuing 4. You love glimpsing animals in Cleverly lit darkness so much you just must go and are prepared to wait wait wait.

Can traverse whole thing by foot quickly without queue but just not feasible with children who anyway are excited by prospect of tram and tour. What we caught of shows was good, but again negated by queuing. Could be great, needs limitation of numbers."
,,Wasting time,2.0,,The place doesn't deserve to be visited. I booked a tour with another group thinking of sending good time . But i came out with different experience . Very few animals less active than the day time. And the most important that hardly you can see them. I thought there will be a night vision goggles to see them but i was disappointed
,,Nice experience but basically a zoo,3.0,,"Travelled as a couple on vacation and had a good experience but this is basically a zoo in an open-environment that is viewed at night... We missed a creatures-of-the-night show that is about 30 minutes so can't comment on that, but the rest of the night safari was nice..."
,,Night safari - very sadly disappointing,2.0,,"I persuaded my husband to do this as I went over 10 years ago and it was amazing. Now it has sadly been heavily commercialised. Expect to queue. You might buy a ticket for 9.15pm entrance but don't expect to be on the transport until 10.30! We didn't get off to walk but I would suggest skipping the safari transport queue and walking your way round. We thought we'd try public transport to get there, the underground is easy but the bus queues were also long give yourself at least 1.5 hours if going from central Singapore. As our tour finished so late because of the queues we had to get a taxi back and expect hefty fees if travelling after 11pm. Also expect another queue! The tour itself was good but arguably not worth the queues and I'm a patient person (hubby less so). I think the saddest part for me was that the zoo promote conservation and protection of animals but the elephants were rocking - my husband said this was a sign of distress so we googled it and sure enough it's common for Asian elephants. I am no expert so my apologies if I have this wrong but this I found very sad. I would not have recommend this tour for the queues it's just not worth it but also now not for the animals either. Sadly dissappinted"
,,Holiday without children,3.0,,"Having stopover in Singapore on the way to Vietnam my wife suggested we visit the night Safari after talking to her mother about it who visited it on her last trip - it really wasn't worth the money or time
Prehaps being tired made me super critical but the assistance on arrival was very poor. Long lines of people who were unsure about what to do and where to go. The que for the tram ride was huge, bigger than the theme park ques on the Gold Coast - noisey and hot and the trip covers only a very small portion of the zoo. Children were distressed and bored waiting for the trams which seemed to be loaded in a chaotic fashion.
My tips if doing the night Safari are
get there early as possible to do the first tram ride -this will give you time to do some walking trails or see the animal feeding shows
don't do this attraction after a full day of sightseeing you will be exhausted
take water you will need a drunk while queing for the tram
dont take very young children its not something I think they will enjoy or appreciate"
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,Night Safari is an excellent experience. We arrived in the evening to our 1st experience at the Zoo and was completely in awe with the different perspective that one achieves by experiencing the nocturnal animals at night. We walked thru a path that had lemurs just chillin' on the walk way...and another area that has bars flying above me head...and got to see the tigers pacing back n forth in their area.
,,I would have rated 0/5 if I could.,1.0,,Terribly run. I'm currently writing this in the line up. Have lined for 2 hours and still have an hour wait for what we paid for (we have waited 1.5 hours after the time on our ticket so far). I'm sure the animals will be nice but I do not recommend the night safari at all. 0 out of 5 from me. CAN NOT STRESS THIS POINT ANYMORE IT IS NOT WORTH IT!
,,Still in line,2.0,,We booked for the 8:15 session. Expecting to wait till around 9:45 before our turn on the tram. Hopefully it's good . Good luck everyone
,,Not That Great and Not That Bad,3.0,,"Visited the night safari last Sunday. Took a public bus 927 from Chua Chu Kang Interchange. Bus ride took about 30 minutes depending on road traffic. Upon reaching the location at around 6.40pm, we were shock to see so many visitors queuing to enter the park. We joined the queue and it took us nearly 50 minutes to enter the park.(Park gate only opens at 7.15pm) While we were in the queue, a lady staff can be heard telling visitors to join the queue. If you hear it once or twice is ok, but she kept telling visitors continuously at the top of her voice. Very annoying. Upon entering the park, we did not manage to catch the first show, so we join the queue for the second show. We were left to stand for another 30 minutes to catch the second show. After show, we took the walking trail to view the animals. After we are done walking, we took the tram ride. The tour host was good, humorous and friendly.

Park management needs more ground staff to assist with huge crowd management during these festive period. Entrance fee is certainly not cheap."
,,Two hour queue spoiled the evening,3.0,,"I visited on 28 Dec 2015 along with 2 overseas visitors and 5 of my family. It was meant to be a highlight of the visitors' trip, but the excitement was spoiled by a two hour wait (no exaggeration there: we timed it). Most disappointingly, we were given no information updates during those two hours. Surely Night Safari staff could have walked the queue lines politely apologising, explaining the reason for the delay and reassuring us about what to expect?

My impression was that on this particular evening too many people were admitted. To ensure a pleasant experience for visitors the NS simply needed to restrict numbers."
,,Terrific,5.0,,"I love this trip well worth the visit , you go round on an open air slow tram and the animals seem really close but there is actually a steep drop between you and them that you can't see , there are different themed restaurant,s and cafes in one the giraffes come up to the verandas whilst you eat , there are also three night walks you can go on to see different animals , you can also book a tram to have your meal on whilst you go round , this was a brilliant night I loved it I would go back again so unique and well worth the money , souvenir shops and gifts shops also and if you didn't want to book a trip you could get there yourself in a taxi which I would do next time as then you could have more time definitely don't miss this trip best in Singapore"
,,Nighht Safari,4.0,,Did a tour of the Night Safari and had a lovely evening although the weather was slightly damp it was still very interesting. Some exhibits were very difficult to see and glad we were on a tour as we did not have to wait for a tram. Pity the show was not longer but was quite good.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Just back from the night safari. The long ques might intimidate you but, trust me if you love wildlife then, it's every bit worth. You almost feel you are strolling in a jungle on a full moon night. I won't describe it more and spoil the fun for you. Just remember, be patient IT'S WORTH ALL THE WAIT!
PS: If you have time go on the walking trails. The creature of the night show is fun, especially for the children."
,,Night well spent,5.0,,"We had heard mixed reviews of the night safari, even our taxi driver on the way questioned why we were going, given that we are in our twenties and didn't have any children with us. He was saying he had many passengers that had gone and barely saw any animals as they were all sleeping- but I feel like this guy was a bit of a sad sack because we went to one of the later sessions, about 8.30pm, and all of the animals were alive, awake and lions literally roaring. I definitely recommend the night safari, check the times of the fire breathing pre show (amazing) and don't be late.
*Also a highlight is the creatures of the night show, don't leave and miss that either."
,,Glad we arrived early!,4.0,,"My husband, 2 teenage boys and I really enjoyed what is best described as zoo extension visit. It was wonderful seeing some animals we hadn't been able to see during our day time visit and also seeing how differently they behave at night. We decided to do the River Safari first and finish there to get to the Night time Safari early and we are certainly glad we did! We arrived in line at 6:30pm for the first time slot of 7:15pm - and the line was already really long! They entertain for a very short time while you are waiting with fire breathers but we made sure one of us remained in the queue at all times. We got on the tram within 10 minutes but without a doubt, if we had arrived later than 6:30pm, we would have been waiting for over an hour easily. The tram ride only goes for about 30 minutes so I would not get off the tram as you will need to wait for space on the next one....you might as well walk if that's the case. It had been raining so had cooled to a very comfortable temperature and we found our tram was not overcrowded. The commentary provided on the tram was interesting and informative. Please note no flash photography allowed - some people just don't care and do it anyway :(

We caught a taxi which was cheaper (and far more convenient) than using the coach for $5 pax (adult). Food is super expensive & in our opinion average at best.

For us, this was all about seeing these wonderful animals so all in all we're really glad we went and would recommend!"
,,Not a good Night Safari,2.0,,"After arriving at 6.45 it took us over 1.5 hours to get on to a bus to make the Safari Experience. There were people everywhere and a lack of organisation leading to a crush of people, which is surprising in Singapore. The number of people trying to get on the buses was badly organised as some left the ""station"" half empty while many people were left waiting. I would not recommend this tour during school holidays or public holidays.... The bus ride itself was OK but the animals available to be seen were quite boring with many of them different varieties of deer.... I will not rush back again"
,,Not good experience at all!,1.0,,"I normally only write hotel reviews in trip advisor but the Night Safari really makes me write my first attraction review here. I lived in Singapore for 6 months and we've been to Singapore few more times but never go to the Night Safari. Heard so much about it so decided to go this time. We went on Dec 26. Not a good choice. It probably is the peak season and there are loads of people. Loads means really really a lot! The zoo opens at 7:15pm. We online purchased the 7:15pm ticket. We arrived 6:45pm and already see millions of people there. However, there's no sign to say where to go. Just crowds and crowds of people. Not a handful of staffs outside to instruct where to go. Finally found the line to queue. There are so many people trying to cut the line, no staffs to help. People is yelling to each other. OK, finally they let people to go in, the line move slowly. Arrived the place near the gate. It's even worse. There are maybe 6,8 gates to go in but the single line suddenly just crowded to so many and there are no lines before the gate. People pushing and it's extremely hot. They even stop people goes in when they start the show near the gate at 8pm. So waited and waited and waited. It's very very bad arrangement. I am sure it's not the first time this happen. I don't know what the management think. Should they have a better plan? More manpower to assist? After you went in, another line for the tram. The whole night is waiting and waiting and waiting. My 2 daughters said this is the worse zoo ever. Never ever going back again!"
,,Very unique experience,5.0,,"Very unique experience, one that can get you very close to the animals. Great attraction when you are travelling with kids. The open bus ride right in between the path of wild animals was the most scary but best experiance"
,,Would have been a 5-star attraction but for the poor management.,2.0,,"The night safari itself is exciting and worth the relatively expensive entrance fee. It is amazing to see how animals behave differently in the dark and how they manage to keep the animals in their own desinated zones. However, we went there during the Christmas holiday period and the crowd control is horrendous. They only allow the crowd to go in at 7:15 pm, 8:15 pm and 9:15 pm and there were long queues and both the ticketing counters and the entrance, so basically everyone needs to line up for more than 1-1.5 hour in order to enter the night safari. Further, the queues at the entrance are very disorganised with very unclear lanes and ventilation is poor. We left the tram ride to around 10:30 pm when many people have already left so the queue was not long, but we did have to queue up for the show though we think it was worth the queue. Lastly, do not bring kids in as most of them were scared in the dark and bored at the long queues. In short, it would have been a 5-star attraction but for the poor management."
,,"Had high expectations, not very impressed",3.0,,"We booked a tour which allowed us priority boarding for the tram and buffet dinner. You must have priority boarding or will you spend all night waiting in line for the team as the queue is very long. Once on the tram we were told not together off at the stops or you would have to wait in line for another team as they are all full and nobody gets off. So the tram ride is about 40 minutes but it's really hard to see any animals as the tram never comes to a complete stop. Forget about taking pictures!! I guess I was expecting more as everyone said we needed to do the Night Safari. Very disappointed and I really wouldn't recommend it as you will be unimpressed. If anything, just walk the trails they have marked and skip the tram as you will see more and at least stretch your legs a bit:"
,,A good night,4.0,,I have to say Jennie our courier was by far the most entertaining we have ever had she was so funny. A good meal before we went into the zoo.
,,An exciting night at the zoo,4.0,,"The Night safari experience is a a unique one wherein you can see nocturnal and wild animals safely from inside your tram. We could see most of the animals which was quite a surprise. Only hitch was that we could not hear the commentary on the tram as it was very noisy.Wish we could have had heard the wonderful commentary. Though overly crowded, the lines are managed quite efficiently and trams are plentiful. Kids really enjoyed seeing various types of animals as also the show. you can also go on walking trails post the tram ride and the show if time and energy permits(as its at the end of a tiring day). Sadly we didnt have enough time for it as we had to catch our coach back to the hotel on time. An expensive attraction worth atleast one watch. Can give it a skip though if you dont have enough time in Singapore or not a wildlife lover."
,,Worst tour of my life,1.0,,Arrived at 8pm for the 8:15pm tour with pre paid tickets and had to queue for two hours to get on the tour which only lasted 3o minutes. The tour ended at 10:30pm so we had to leave immediately to get the bus back to the MRT which closes at 11:45pm. This tour was the most insulting experience I have ever been on. Do not waste your money and time on the night safari.
,,What a Shambles!,1.0,,"Completed this visit with my adult daughter as we had heard good reports of the Night Safari. Yes we had read negatives about queues for the tram ride. Well tonight was unbelievable - virtually no direction or organisation by Zoo staff outside the entry. Even though the system of staggered entry times is in operation nothing to say if you have your ticket come this way. As for the mass of humanity straining to gain entry, I have never seen so many people display such bad manners when it comes to queueing and waiting their turn. This was especially so with one national group who were most representative of poor behaviour, manners and pushiness in trying to get large family groups to the front!

Yes we did the tram ride first and at least the queue first and at least the queue control here was far better managed. Thank heavens we did the ride as on our return the heavens opened and there was no point in walking any of the trails.

Commentary on the tram ride was informative and that is the only positive comment I feel able to make. All in all a waste of money and an unpleasant holiday experience.

If you want a good zoo experience and have the opportunity then visit Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo, New South Wales, Australia."
,,Somewhere to avoid during school holidays,2.0,,"We decided to take an inclusive tour to the night Safari on 28th December. . . . A bad mistake!
Arrived on the first bus to meet horrendous queues, it took well over an hour to get on the tram. by the time we got on the tram we were reluctant to get off at the middle stop so just went round grabbed a quick bite and then caught the 9.00pm bus back.
The tram tour was no better than OK but the whole experience was spoiled by the crowds.
It would probably have been better to make our own way there arriving later when the queues were smaller but stay until closing and get a taxi back."
,,Very exsiting,5.0,,"I love this place. All the shows, nocturnal animals. Watching all the animal from very close distance. I took phot with Big python and lion cub."
,,Zoo extension,5.0,,"Though separate, on can visit the day zoo, then move to Night Safari. Too much? Separate the visits. Lovely place with enough test stops and decent food at decent price."
,,A memorable attraction.,5.0,,"Well worth it. Amazing to see exotic jungle and savanna animals up so close and yet at safe arm's length from a tram with commentary that takes you around a trail alongside the exhibits. Most of these animals were in view and awake which was a change to the experience you might have of not being able to catch sight of nocturnal animals during daytime visits to zoos. By coach bus and with a tour group leader, we went with tourists that had pre-booked a tour in arrangement with their own hotel and it allowed you to take the lengthy trip from central Singapore in air conditioned comfort, and on arrival, to bypass the long queues of families who needed to purchase entry tickets at the venue itself. The pre-booked tour does give you an opportunity for a specified period of time afterwards to also wander through the reserve on foot to have a closer look at the animals. If you are not that way inclined on the night you can instead have a meal at a number of eateries that cater to different tastes although relatively overpriced in some cases. If you can stretch your budget considerably more you can purchase souvenirs of your visit here. There are also some spectacular sideshows, one performed for example by a fire-eating trio; mind you the fumes of kerosene pervade downwind in the viewing area. A definite and memorable attraction when visiting Singapore if time permits."
,,Not worth the time and money,1.0,,This is a visit to the zoo in the night. Every one wants to enter early as the park only opens at 7:15pm. Nothing special about the tram. Many animals were hiding or a sleep. Not worth the money.
,,Waste of time and money,2.0,,"This night night safari is in my opinion a waste of both time and money. Not talking about the long taxi ride, the queue itself to get into the safari was very long (30 minutes). The tram ride was nothing special as the animals were far away and it was dark so it was difficult to see them. The highly anticipated show is nothing to even remotely get your hopes up for, instead of being a show about animals it was a failed comedy act for kids. There was a very limited amount of animals in the show (around 5) and they were nothing special. This safari is like a zoo, there are a lot of people, it is expensive and you can not get close to the animals.

Although this wildlife park has quite a large variety of animals it does not even compare to the wildlife parks I've been to in Australia. Unless you haven't been to a good zoo or wildlife park (or have small children) and considering you are not running out of attractions there are better things to do in Singapore."
,,The open bus ride home was the highlight,2.0,,Queued to long. Many rude people pushing in and animals had gone to bed. I wish I had!!!!!! Go there miss the safari and get the open air bus back. Save your money and get the best of your evening.
,,Great activity,5.0,,Great evening and such an unusual way to se the animals. Spray up as the mozzies will get you! We had a great time being driven about the zoo on a land train. It was great fun and recommended for the whole family.
,,A scrum,3.0,,Line up in a bad food court and elbow your way into a line and onto a tram and then strain to see the animals in the dark Hmm average at best
,,This was a different experience.,3.0,,You can enjoy night show & fire show first.Then you have to wait for a long time for trum.Then you will get a trum and enjoy night safari.
,,Don't wait in line!,5.0,,"Loved this!! Got there about 7:30 and had tickets already...if the line is long for the tram then go ahead and start on the walking trail and you can get on the tram at the east lodge, no wait! Then end with the Creature of the night show....We loved the evening stroll and got on the tram easily...."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"The idea of a night zoo safari this sounds fantastic, but due to the degree of difficulty seeing animals in the night light, we didn't enjoy this as much as anticipated.
I treid to capture some night time aniumal photos, but sadly as explained I can't rave about them."
,,Night safari,1.0,,Horrible . Terrible . Just lost money $$$$$$$$$$ factory for tourist. Waiting long queue. Everything are very expensive .
,,Amazing night safari,4.0,,"We weren't sure what to expect from the night safari and found we loved it! It gets very very busy at peak times so be prepared to queue however the queues move reasonably quickly. You get on to a train with open carriages however the weather was very warm even at night so the light breeze was very comfortable.
It was amazing to see all the animals especially at night time - the areas of the safari are lit up subtly so you can see all that you need to. There is a guide on each train load of passengers explaining what to look out for. They keep telling you not to use cameras with flashlights but off course there are some people who take no notice of that!
After the guided trip around you can get off and walk around the safari park. The animals are all kept behind various paddocks so no chance of mingling with the lions by accident fortunately!"
,,Worst Singapore Attraction Due to Poor Management,1.0,,"Dear Customers Service,

This is the worst Singapore attraction due to poor management.
I am currently queuing at the night safari, I bought 715pm ticket, I arrived at 7pm, and now at 823pm I am still queuing waiting to the entrance. I hardly see any staff assisting the crowd and explaining the situation, ppl queuing regardless if they have purchased the ticket or not, ppl are unclear there is different time slot. Honestly without explanation by the staff these foreign tourists (99% from what I see from here) do not know there are different time slots.
Besides, there is no clear indication on the queue, ppl cutting queue however staff are not here to assist.
Also, after the fire performance, the whole environment is full of kerosine smell. Ppl are stucked, with less than 10cm distance apart from each other, no one could move, if there is emergency, ppl will be stepped on!

I believe the tickets have been over sold hence causing such a chaotic situation. This is so un-ethical of Singapore safari. this is really an unpleasant experience visiting Singapore!
I am still queuing after 1.5 hours!

,,Mehh,3.0,,"After going to the zoo during the day, the night safari has nothing on that. There was massive lines for the trams - was ridiculous. It was quicker to walk the whole thing. Some cool animals in there to see. But if you can only do one thing, not both - I recommend the zoo."
,,Pick of the zoo tours,4.0,,"Huge crowds, overpriced but we enjoyed it. The tram tour was the highlight, although it broke down and we had to change, which apparently is common. Did see some good things though. Be prepared to queue, fire dancers pass a few minutes, animal show not worth seeing, spend more time walking around."
,,"Very unique experience, one that can get you very close to the animals",4.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari was one of the highlights of our recent trip here in Singapore. The fact that Singapore is humid and hot during the day time, makes this night trip all the better. You should get your tickets online to avoid the crowds and the queue for the tickets. Once you're there, the queue for the entry starts around 645-7pm, and you're entertained with a group of fire breathers. If you're in the queue with small kids, your kids might miss out on this performance as they would be ""height challenged"" to see through the crowd. You can queue on the far left line which brings you closer to the performers (and the hot flames!) Mind the smell of the fuel they use!

The queue can be slow as they clear the crowd through which was one of the annoying part of the trip. We saw almost all of the animals, and one of the highlights for me was getting close enough to a massive Malaysian Tapir while on the tram (must do for a full loop).

Overall a 4.5/5 experience, the 0.5 deduction from a full 5/5 is because of the poor crowd control for queues to enter and trams by the Safari staff. At one point, while waiting for a tram, we had to wait close to 30 mins while multiple trams came by without room to pick us up - and the staff took offence to use giving them feedback on us wanting to get on a tram ASAP."
,,Disappointed,1.0,,"We were disappointed with our visit on Friday night.

The queue for the tram ride was long. I asked to sit at the end because I can't bend my left knee, but the staff ignored my request until we insisted in getting out & wait for the next tram.

The animal show was OK. It was too dark to really see the animals from the tram. Good thing it didn't rain, or else we may not be able to see any animals.

A waste of time & money (in addition to the entrance fee, we had to pay $50 for taxi rides from/to our hotel)."
,,Best thing is Singapore and the most unique experience.,5.0,,"Whenever I travel, I like to see places that are unique to that city or country. For me Night Safari is that attraction in Singapore. I have not seen anything like this before. It is amazing how they make the wild animals stay at one place under the light. We took a bus tour for this place. Overall an experience of a life time."
,,The Orangutans,5.0,,"The night zoo is a great experience, but for my wife and I the Orangutans were the must-see aspect of the zoo. Endangered in the wild, you can get your photo only a couple feet from them as the babies play in the background."
,,Nice but horrendously overpriced food,3.0,,"The attractions and layout is good and it is nice to see the animals in a semi free environment

Because the place is self contained and reasonably isolated the managers see fit to charge over four times normal price for very average food and beverage.Next time(if there is one)I will avoid the food and beverage sellers completely.

Apart from being gouged I had an enjoyable time."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,One of its kind in Asia and a must visit place for everyone who go to singapore... Clean and well managed zoo and good eat outs too
,,Great fun for all ages,4.0,,Been here a couple of times and enjoyed each time. The starting show with animals is great fun too. Must visit if you are in SG. Starts at 7:30 pm every day.
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"I'm against zoo's in general, but this place is amazing. It is structured to give you the feeling like you are discovering things while ""getting lost."" There are tons of nooks and crannies to explore. I'm 30 years old and felt like Indiana Jones.

If you have kids, this is a must. I would skip universal studios and do just this. There is no other place that let's you get up close to animals like the night safari.

Great bang for your buck IMO."
,,Wow,5.0,,"The night safari is a real wow. The best part is the fire eating before the show, get there early so you can be close. Take the tram as soon as you can as the lines get long quickly."
,,So awesome!,5.0,,"This is a brilliant thing to do - one of the best things we did in Singapore! We arrived at 8pm and it was sooooo busy and I was worried it was going to be a nightmare; we saw the creatures of the night show first which was fun, great for kids but slightly cheesy. Once the crowds from that dispersed we did the four walks around and it was fine - not too busy at all. Food and drink are pricey there so try and eat dinner before you get there. There's a constant supply of taxis to get you back to the city afterwards."
,,Truly admirable,5.0,,This place will make you wonder about people's mind and their intelligence. So beautifully designed place and the best service staff ever ..!!
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This does get crowded sopick your day carefully. My advice would be to skip the tram ride (and the queues) and just walk the tracks which means you get to see some exhibits you cant see from the tram ride and its good exercise too!

The food here is pretty expensive so eat before you come.

The fire show is excellent fun and always amuses the kids!"
,,Amazing to see animals at night,4.0,,"To enjoy night safari you need to make good planning. I hope this review will help.

Night safari happens at a place next to the River Safari area. There are three entry times if you are buying tickets from the venue (7.15PM, 8.15PM and 9.15PM). I suggest buying online tickets (If possible 4 in 1 parkhopper). Online ticket holder can enter at any time. Nearby the entrance there are a few restaurants.

There are 4 things to experience in the night safari.
1. Fire breathing performance at the entrance. Check website for timings
2. Tram ride
3. Trail walk
4. Creatures of the night show

My visit was in the order above. Fire show was at around 7 PM followed by tram ride at 7.30PM. Be aware that queue for entry starts at around 6PM on public holidays. If you are ahead in the queue you can catch the tram early. Tram covers most of the animals from different parts of the world. Himalyan, Asian, African etc. Be sensitive to animals and don't use flash or talk loudly. It is not guaranteed that all animals will be visible.
After the tram ride go for a trail walk in this order. Wallaby trail> East lodge trail> Leopard trail> Fishing cat trail. It is walk in jungle with dimly lit pathways. Some may be scared to walk. You can see animals at a close range which you couldn't see from the tram ride.
Once you finish the fishing cat trail you will be back at the entrance. Then proceed to the amphitheater to see some exotic animals very close.
Buses are available late night (11.45PM lastfor Ang Mo Kio terminal).

Umbrella and mosquito repellent are recommended. Some animals may be behind the bushes and you may not see."
,,"Enjoyed the night safari, but the place was crowded",4.0,,"For all the attractions in Singapore it is better to buy the entry ticket from a tour operator because it is 20-30% less than the counter price.

The was really good and especially the night safari was a great experience. You can take the hop-on hop-off bus and enjoy the open roof top ride its interesting. The only issue is with the return trip as the bus goes around the town and takes more time to reach your destination."
,,A must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Our guide told us that the Night Safari was the outcome of a $30 mn investment and one of the best in the world. First I was a little skeptical, but when I saw the white proud African Lion sitting just 10 meters from me, I was sold.
We were lucky as a couple of White African lions were on loan to the zoo and not everyone gets to see that. Then there were the elephants, the bears and neel gais and many other beautiful creatures.
The next awesome thing was the lighting. It seems as if there is moonlight throughout the place and they have been especially designed to be light on the eyes of the animals and give a perfect view to the tourists."
,,The only disappointment in Singapore was night zoo!,2.0,,"You can give it a miss in my opinion. The tram took around the zoo in the night showing some animals and that's it! There was nothing special in this. They have showed some animals like tiger, elephant in the night in the tram. The morning zoo was far better with shows and other stuff. We went in October 2014 but as trip advisor doesn't give me the option, I gave October 2015"
,,A great place to take your kids,5.0,,"it is a fun and exciting place for both adults and kids. Expect long queue during holidays and weekends, it is worth the wait"
,,Disturbed Elephants,1.0,,"Yes, elephants, on a night safari. They were rocking back and fourth, standing in one spot, which is a well known sign of distress. Elephants get a huge amount of sensory information through vibrations on the ground travelling through their feet. These elephants are in enclosures either side of the road that a very big 'tram' travels down every few minutes. This is clearly causing them distress and it was really sad to see. They need to be removed from the night safari, or at the very least, from the route the tram takes. There are other animals only accessible via walking trails, surely this would be a more ethical placement for the elephants?"
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Well

It is different than the normal zoo

And it is not the ""Safari"" like Africa however it is a great experience

The best things was the show where the animals show few tricks

And the Bat cave was something thrilling

I recommend visiting it as it is unique and a new experience"
,,Great yet frustrating experience,3.0,,"We left the night safari with conflicting emotions. We definitely enjoy going to the zoo, and in particular, the Singapore zoo. We have been in the day and absolutely loved it, then we were told that it's all about the night safari.

Before I go on a rant, the concept of a night safari was really great. Up close and personal with these animals while being driven around on a tram, sometimes it felt like you can reach out and touch the animals.

When we visited Singapore this time, we had our new born and werent sure if the night safari would be suitable, conscious of disturbing others on the tram with a crying baby..... this was the least of anyone's concern.

The queue to get into the zoo was easily over 40mins, but we didn't mind as it was a weekend so completely understandable. What was annoying were the people constantly cutting into the queue and others standing well into your personal space. Once we got up to the Tram, many people had no respect for their seat and were just running across other queues to sit where they wanted (these were adults!!).

On the tram itself, people were so loud you couldn't hear the recorded tour guide. There were even people having telephone conversations. Others completely disregarding the no flash rule, and even after being told numerous times they continued to take photos with the flash on. In addition, rubbish being tossed off the tram.

We normally have lots of patience for crowd behaviours but this time it was frustrating as you couldn't even hear the guided tour. We were shocked and couldn't believe it - very disappointing!"
,,Great experience showcasing all the continents,5.0,,"This is a must do in Singapore! I highly recommend night safari, as it is not quite so hot at night, there are also trams that take you most of the way and there are plenty of animals to see at night. Also make sure you don't miss the special animal shows in the amphitheatre."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I had first visited the night safari a decade back I think since then whenever I have visited made it a point to see this place . Over the years the crowd has increased but the place has remained the same . The famous animal show is a must watch for everybody ,children love it . However there are long queues for the animal show and the night safari trains . The animals look bored . But the presentation is great . They have a restaurant which served Indian food . Overall fun evening"
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Just to give a background, we landed in Singapore at 3 pm after having traveled for 11 hours (including transit). None of us had proper sleep, yet we ventured to the night safari. I am so glad we went as it was a perfect start to the family vacation.

We saw the night of the creatures show, conducted by yamini. It was done very well and was quite interactive.

The tram ride was very good. You go through all the zones. The lighting and settings went hand in hand with zones we were in. Highlight was the entrance to African Savannah when you approach giraffe, oryx and zebra enclosure. The lake was breathtaking.

The kids absolutely loved the place and I am glad we came on day 1"
,,Up close and personal,5.0,,"I loved the night safari as I get to sit in the free tram that goes around the park and be real close to some animals who roam freely near the tram. To get the most out of this park, be there as soon as it opens, as the queue for the tram can be very long. It can be quite dark walking to some exhibits, and challenging observing some smaller animals in the dark. Lastly, plan your time well as public buses end their services around midnight, and taxis impose midnight charges."
,,Walk through night safari is recommended,4.0,,"Singapore night safari is open on evening and we can visit there after enjoy with Singapore zoo.

the show is ok and safari tram is good.

but the best thing is walk trail activity. It make you for an excellent experience. slowly watch the natural behavior of animal in night time with silent; you will never forget it."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"I have been to many zoos and safaris but never at night. A great twist with nocturnal animals. We walked around before getting on the tram, workout good for us. There are some good places to eat there before going in, recommend trying those instead of eating before going."
,,incredible,5.0,,Hello if come to Singapore you have to visit the night zoo our first time in Singaopore 5 years ago we diden´t have enough so we said if we come we will go and it realy fantastic to drive with the car train trough the forest we like it a lot and have seen crying wolfs so near that you had the feeling yo u could touch them go and make your on experience
,,Recommended for Families,3.0,,"Night safari is a spectacle which I can recommend to mainly families with kids. The location is more in the north-central part of Singapore and it take some time to get there,est. 1hr. You will be experiencing some life show and a 15min train ride where you will encounter various animals from the zoo. Also you have the choice to walk on a special track which will take you longer."
,,"Night Safari with a trendy twist, not to miss during your Singapore Visit!",5.0,,"Excellent theme based park with amazing fire show at the entry.
Tram ride to view all live animals and the best part was as the commentary went on the animals appeared exactly (beautifully trained).
At the exit there was an amphitheatre show wherein live animals came in from any corner which was amazing and very good show. Worth all money and their efforts!"
,,"Amazing, a must.",5.0,,"Went as a group of friends, absolutely loved it. We arrived at about 9pm, and just about finished all of the zoo by midnight.

Take the tram ride first, takes about 40 minutes. Then do the trials by foot.

The enclosures are so well done so you often can't see any bars or screens. There are sections where you are free to walk amongst the animals."
,,Dont miss this attarction,5.0,,"We have waited very long time to enter , there was very huge crowd. We saw animals and birds at night , A very different experience. few people took a walk to see animals by themselves. Overall it is a must see attraction in Singapore."
,,Disappointing show and transport arrangements,2.0,,"I went to night safari 7 years ago and now that I re-visit again, I find it disappointing, there are poor arrangements that didn't improved even after 7 years
1) you will notice that all info only pointing to tell u that you can go by taking MRT to Ang Mo Kiu and then take bus. No info is available on how to come back and the timing. The last bus back to MRT was 1030, but the Safari operate until 12am! And the bus journey from MRT to Night Safari was at least 40 mins.
2) the queue was way too long. Even with online ticket purchased. We ended up queing for >30mins just to enter into the place, and another 40 mins to get on the Tram. I would thought that online ticketing was meant to control the number of visitors so that everyone can enjoy the visit. By the end of all queing, we had to quickly rush out to catch the last Coach (later than the bus to MRT) at 11pm to back to city area already
3) the show was BAD. I can understand that it is hard to train wild animal esp for night show, but I would expect higher quality show in SG Night Safari. The show is the same as 7 years ago. there were only otter and racoon that came out for a walk and the rest was about the person talking and joking on stage. It is not worth for 30 mins queue into the show theater and then anotehr 30mins to watch the show"
,,"Horrible, total waste of $$ and time!!",1.0,,"Spent over $250 to get there (4 of us + 1 child) including admission. Very far from the city, can't hardly see the animals, too dark....the tram over crowded and VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. Screaming staff trying to rush and pack in the people...so rude!! It's just one big rip off to say the least.....they seem to concern themselves more with the photo concession and food stalls then anything else! The supposedly show (if you really want to call it that) with animals was extremely boring with a self-centered lady trying to say hello in 4 languages....HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE....I would highly recommend anyone just to go to the zoo in the daytime....so much better....and at least you can see the animals....THE NIGHT SAFARI SUCKS!!!"
,,Night Zoo,5.0,,"We went to the night zoo as part of a group excursion. You can book at any hotel and a shuttle picks you up. It is about 30 minutes away from the city if the traffic is OK. It was indeed an experience. You see tigers, elephants etc very close up and the night lends an eerie feel as if you are really in the jungle. You travel through the zoo on a mini train or can walk. It is lovely and cool going down into the gully. Fun experience"
,,A new experience,4.0,,That is a total new experience to go to the zoo. Ask the taxi drive what is will cost as we experienced to different prices.. 24SG$ going and 12SG$ return. Have some rain proof ponchos with you as it tents to rain in the evenings in winter.
,,Better than the zoo,5.0,,We did the river safari in the afternoon and then walked up to the night safari - we then did the walks first before boarding the train. There are initially big queues to get in so we sat and had a drink at the entrance for about 30 minutes then went in easily - every one seems to do the train first but by doing the walk it meant we saw a lot of animals without the crowd - the train then passes through parts of the Zoo hence no need to do the Zoo
,,Love the Bats!!!,4.0,,"Use lots of anti mosquito spray on you! Make sure you're there for opening fire-eating display. Queues for the road train can sometimes be quite long at the beginning, so perhaps choose to walk around a bit first and take the train ride later. The Bats are not for the squeamish!"
,,Excellent outing for teh family,5.0,,"what a great place to visit, from the fire performers to the animals there is a lot to see an do for everyone. The wild animal collection is excellent with different types of species. The kids will love it. worth a visit when in Singapore."
,,Amazing place that you must visit,5.0,,I'm not quite interested in animal and zoo in general but this was a thrilling and awesome experience I took a Night Safari Tour. I came in direct contact with the animal. They walked around us as we were riding the cart. It was a little bit scary too to have animals surrounding me in the dark but it was an unique experience that I've never found any where else. The tour guide gave us very detailed instruction and guide to the tour. They offer it in English as well. After that there was short animal show coming in every hour. I was very satisfied with my experience in general.
,,Zoo,4.0,,The zoo safari at night is very enjoyable. Good way to relax and unwind after a day working abroad. The elephant in particular was quite impressive. Worth a visit for sure.
,,Zoo by night,5.0,,"Good experience when viewing at night, some wonderful lights and colours and the animals still active"
,,Only disappointing attraction in singapore,2.0,,"You can give this attraction a miss. In spite of it being in the same zoo premise I suggest you can rather exit and watch the sun go down when you are back at the quay.

TIP: there are buses outside the premise to get you back to the hotel. Our bus took us around the city and dropped us back home so late that even the local shops around the City Hall had closed except for the store seven eleven. :("
,,must watch,5.0,,"its an experience in itself, especially the shows which is done after the buggy ride. hosts were very good and entertained every one on the safari."
,,Sleepy Time at the Zoo,3.0,,"Even though the Park feeds the animals, trying to keep them awake ( if the spotlights don't do the trick)...most of the snimals are sleeping...hard to see from the Tram. Hard to see majestic Lions and a Tiger penned up....I'm probably the wring person to review this activity.

Guys breathing fire at the Front Gate were interesting to watch, as you wait to board the Tram...But not sure I'd recommend this one."
,,Night safari,4.0,,The night safari was fantastic! Highly recommended. Make sure you see the fire show and the night creatures show! You can also see lion feedings.
,,Lots of fun!,5.0,,"We had a great time at the night safari. Several of the animals were within a couple of feet, as we drove by. You have to ride the tram and walk the he trials, to see everything. The shows were pretty cool too."
,,Must See,5.0,,"A really enjoyable evening at Singapore Zoo's Night Safari.
Best to book in advance, or perhaps as part of a packaged tour (for easy entry), it is very crowded.

The tram tour was excellent and it was nice to see the animals in totally looking natural enclosures and not behind thick fencing.
They appeared to be very close to the trams at times and were easy to see.

After spending a considerable amount of time in a line to see the Creatures of the Night show, it was cancelled due to rain. As was the fire-breathing show too. Both in outdoor auditoriums.
It was a nuisance to waste time in a line like that, when we could have been walking along one of the many trails there. We were on a packaged tour, so we only had limited time.

It was not a cheap night out (food and drinks were expensive). It would have been good to have seen the shows for more value for money."
,,Different Expirience,3.0,,You may skip this attraction if you have already visited such place during you trip of Singapore - Malaysia - Thailand. In night due to low light you may not enjoy it. But it is different kind of experience so if you have spare time after visiting all main attraction you should visit this
,,Amazing experience in tropical rain forest at night in the city,5.0,,"Night safari, Singapore zoo and river safari located at the same place. you can do all 3 in a single day but be prepare to walk the whole day. definitely not recommended unless you are up for it.

We did the night safari by getting in first session. Rule of thumb get in early so you can finish early. Do expect long queue at the entrance. So get there early and you can have your dinner there before the park open at 7.15pm. Once you are in, skip the tram ride as the queue will be long. Go to the creature of the night show or start with fishing cat trail. this will save you ample of time. after the fishing cat trail, continue to leopard trail, then catch the tram ride at the east lodge with 0 wait time. the tram will bring you back to the main entrance where you can catch the show or hit the wallaby trail. this will cover the whole park, and get you to the animal as close as you can get on and off tram. this is what we did and we are out of the part by 9:15pm, exhausted but happy.

along the trail there will be zoo staff accompany you along the trail explaining the animals and their habitat. it was fun trying to spot them in the dark as the trail was not properly lit but you still can find your way around. do wear comfortable walking shoe as the trail could be slippery when wet and it is not flat. a fair warning when you are on the tram stop next to the huge elephant. it was a great sight to see the giant animal but it will spray mud towards the tram and it wont be pleasant. so cover yourself.

we took a taxi from orchard to the zoo, for around $25 for a 30 min ride. we then took the open top double decker bus back to the city at $7 per person, took about 30min as well. dont buy SAEX transport ticket online as they will slash their price down to $5 per person on site.

do plan your trip carefully, when it rain you would be able to enjoy the safari. so get your tickets when you know the weather will be good that night. we were lucky because on the day it was raining the whole afternoon then the sky clear up around 4pm."
,,Totally difference experience of safari,5.0,,"The experience is totally different, it more like making natural things from urbanization. I would say still it is costly trip but it is different experience!"
,,Ohk ohk,2.0,,Night safari dance n show was awesome .rest all d animal in night not able seen properly in tram..so I found it not so good as per my view..but there was a long que to see same
,,Too Dark and the Usual Animals,2.0,,"The place is too dark and it is difficult to see the animals, which are the usual deer, lions etc. The concept of a night zoo is a good one but it needs to be implemented a lot better. Overall, much room for improvement."
,,disappointing and expensive,2.0,,"the first problem was with SAEX bus service which was an hour late. this significantly reduced our time at Night Safari and made it impossible to see the animal show. when I called SAEX they told me that their ""system"" was down and they had no idea where their bus was. it's a 100% Indian operation and seemed disorganized and shoddy.

at the NS itself, we ate an expensive mediocre dinner and then got on the tram. the ticket seller forgot (!!) to give us our tickets so we had to go all the way back to the booth and get them. we saw many malaysian deer and little else. the narration recording on the tram did not match what we were seeing in the forest. the animal show was scheduled only once an hour so we missed it rather than wait 1 hour and went home after only 2 hours. the whole adventure cost US$125 and seemed a rip-off at that price."
,,Great teamwork and Will definitely visit again,4.0,,"Went to night safari with my wife yesterday to celebrate a special occasion. Despite going on a Friday evening with high volume of visitors , we really enjoy ourselves .
We were able to see the animals closed up and actively feeding. Despite our failing hearing and poor eyesight , the staff in wallaby trail , Cecelia and the fishing cat trail , Rosita were outstanding , patiently explaining the enclosure and even helped us spot an animal or two . The creature of the night was well hosted . Over all we would like to share a few tips and suggestion :
1. Go as early as possible
2. Go for the trail walk first instead of queuing up for the tram , as it seems the feeding time for most animals were fed about 730pm.
3. Then go for the show at 930pm as its less crowded
3. Finally go for the tram ride , we manage to see many beautiful animals come out to graze.

As for the NS, think there is still room for improvement particularly on the admission process.
Overall the experience was a great one."
,,Best place to Visit night time for First Time,4.0,,"Night safari is basically zoo with added features ....here they divided into certain things

1. Trom : where you can sit and see diffrent animals most of them from Africa and India
2. walking Trails in ortificial forest where you just walk with ur loved once and see some animals , good 40 min walk
3. Fire dance this is the best one out side in front of gate must watch thing
4. There is a small show held every hour after 7.15 pm good one

If you want to go by MRT you have to getdown Ang mo kio and catch bus"
,,Not upto the expectation,2.0,,The zoo is really far. Almost 1 hour drive from suntec. Had high expectations from the safari. It's well maintained but hardly saw an animal. And tge safari was very short. Disappointing.
,,Well designed night safari,4.0,,"A really special night out. I especially loved how the designers were considerate of the animals when planning the lighting, it's as if the zoo is lit by moonlight and the result is you feel as if you are discovering the animals more naturally in their habitat. We had a private tour which only gave us time to walk one trail but it was fun, I'd never seen cats fishing before! Nor had I seen or heard of many of the animals we saw along the trail, amazing collection! The tram ride was great and we didn't have to queue so it was even more special ...ie not having to wait in that heat! The tram takes about 40mins, stopping once and the animals on show were amazing and of course beautiful. However, I felt a bit sad and uncomfortable at the small space some of the larger animals were kept in, it seems a bit sad to leave them in such a small enclosure and I asked our guide if maybe they have a larger place to wander freely but he was unsure.

The elephants, lions and tigers and bears and rhino and hippos were all so beautiful and seemed at peace so perhaps I was worrying about nothing. Plenty of places to eat and drink and they've done an excellent job in the layout of this area giving a sense of space which helped with the large amount of people moving through the zoo.

A brilliant fire show ended the evening (I skipped the animal show and grabbed a cab back which costs less than 20bucks). Definitely a must for children and families and people of all ages!"
,,Cool place,4.0,,It was ok place to visit. We didn't allow enough time as most reviews recommended to go later in the evening. So many people and didn't get to see as much as we would have wanted to.
,,Great Night Experience,4.0,,organised tour through the hotel and everything went great. skipped the line up and did the tram tour in short time. The walked round the park. Was not great for taking photos at night as no flash is allowed but experience was good. Dropped us back to our hotel afterwards.
,,Magical at night,4.0,,"My husband and I went at night. The animals might be more awake especially the felines. I enjoyed very much walking between all the animals living areas. Being completely outdoor with tons of trees between each areas, it felt like walking in the jungle. We are not big fans of zoos usually since we had the chance to do safaris in different places in the world. But if you are to visit one zoo, I would recommend this one as it feels a bit closer to seeing the animals in their real habitats. The little shuttle making tour the whole zoo is also nice."
,,Pretty Average only by world standards,3.0,,I guess for such a small island it is good for locals who don't have to travel to see some of these animals. By world standards though you will be disappointed.
,,Favourite zoo experience,5.0,,"I had been to the river safari, the day zoo and the night safari. The night safari was a unique experience and it was not crowded. Further, it was not that hot at night compared to day time. I highly recommend a trip to night safari!"
,,Bring my kids to Safari,4.0,,"My kids love the animals, due to warm season, I chose to visit the place in the night. As evening are cooling much easy for kids love around the area. Anyway for explore their life to see how wild animals & their activities in the night life.
Enjoy & cheers !"
,,I didn't like it,2.0,,"Clean, well designed and organised but I still didn't like it. I don't think that animals feel so much like they were in the jungle and the night safari also is totally overrated. It seems nice because it's night so you cannot see the cages, but really not much difference to all other zoos."
,,experience the zoo at night,5.0,,"its the same, but after sunset it becomes night safari in a mini train with audio, just awesome, how they are maintaining it feels like being in a forest in south Africa, children would freak out"
,,Night safari tour,5.0,,"As a local, we have been many times and this is the one ""Singapore must see"" that we advise all our visitors and they all have raved about the experience. However it was only recently that we heard about the Private Night Safari Tour, so when our last visitor was here recently we all we went on it. It is a bit pricey but the experience was amazing. It starts with a meal in a local restaurant which was OK, but I do not like buffets, with masses of tour groups, however the rest of the tour was stellar, stunning and unbelievably interesting. First you have an animal show, which is fun but the best is afterwards. You have your own private guide and this is what make the tour so fantastic. Our guide was a very experienced professional naturalist and Professor at the National University and so had a deep knowledge of all the wildlife. The tour starts with a walking Tour of part of the first part of the Safari and almost immediately you see the Fishing Cats. It is amazing sight to see cats leaping into and swimming in the water to catch food. Then on to many animals including the leopard who was hiding when we were there, unfortunately. After this half of the tour we were taken by a buggy to places you cannot normally get to. There were too many species seen to name, both local and exotic from lions and Giraffes to many species of deer. Towards the end there came a wonderful highlight. We met and fed the Elephants. This portion lasted for 15 to 20 minutes and we never felt rushed at anytime during the tour. There were three adult elephants, two friendly and one shy. They were very gentle and loved the bananas. At the end we were given souvenir photographs and went away from one of the best experiences I have had in 15 years in Singapore. Highly recommended, albeit pricey.,"
,,Essential singapore,4.0,,Did a tour with buffalo tours. Well organised and plenty of time. We did not have to wait in line for the tram which was great given the large line lengths but I did notice that if you walk the zoo first the tram lines are much shorter later in the night.The tram was a good way to get an overview.
,,Not that Great,5.0,,Fire show is main attraction.. rest walking trails are enjoyable.. otherwise tram rides are Ok OK.. more natural feel is required.
,,nice with ride,4.0,,is nice that they provide free ride inside the zoo i dont think we will walk the paths..lol is cool too see the animals at nite time
,,Not as good as I thought...,2.0,,"We did a Night Zoo tour, and to be honest it was not as good as we thought it would be.The lines were increadably long and took ages to get on the train.
Once we were on the train, although going slow did not stop for even a few seconds for photos. There were a lot of animals to see, and we were amazed they were so active, but really no more animals here than in any other zoo we have ever been to....
Sorry I just do not think it was worth the money...."
,,A must do!,5.0,,"If you're visiting the Singapore zoo, a visit to the Night Safari is an absolute must! We were lucky enough to have an up close encounter with a beautiful tiger separated by only a few centimetres of glass! If you're lucky you might also get to see the Fishing Cat go fishing! Some parts are sad, like at most zoos but there are constant reminders of conservation efforts and that the animals are very well looked after.

Definitely don't take the tram ride first! Walk around and enjoy the other animal exhibits before going on the tram later in the night (when the lines are much smaller, unless of course you like waiting hours in a queue)"
,,Night Safari,4.0,,It is an amazing experience. The animals look so well cared for and in their natural habitat. It is good to go with friends and young children might enjoy it. Your not allowed to use flash but it is quite well lighted in some areas. Everyone going should definitely wear walking shoes also bring a water bottle.
,,Gd experience!!,3.0,,Walk all the 4 trails and saw some other animals tt could not be found in the zoo along the way! Tram was alright abt 40 mins long! However I was rather disappointed in the creatures of the night show which I had queued up way before the show started just to secure a seat which meant I went there 35 mins earlier than the starting time! This was due to the earlier show the seats were all taken so I had no choice but to come way earlier just to get seats for the next show! And the show frankly speaking was nothing impressive! Have seen way better shows than this!!
,,One time experience,3.0,,Nothing wow about it but yes one time in life you can have this experience to take a round near wild animals in open car and show with animals
,,Amazing. May have been even better than the zoo itself!,5.0,,"Best way to do it is get on the tram system first. Do the whole park, takes around 40 mins. Then start at the entrance and walk the 'trails'.
Even before you enter, there was a great dance and light show. Followed by fire breathers just through the gates.
Setting the animals at night was great, something you never really experience. On tram, it drives through areas with deer etc just walking around freely. Really enjoyed that.
Excellent conservation messages displayed throughout (as with Singapore Zoo).
Park takes around 2 hours 45 mins to finish, we went late at night when there weren't many other people around.
I couldn't recommend this any harder. Chose the best package for you as it can be cheaper to buy a week entry ticket for all parks (couldn't do more than one in a day)."
,,Must Visit kind of place,4.0,,Not a lot of majestic animals but still many varieties. The concept of night safari is very good. A tram first gives a tour of all the animals to see inside. Then one can go on a walking tour in 3 routes (could be more). 3 hours is not enough to cover all of them. There are 2 must watch shows of 15 mins each.
,,Not sure what I expected,3.0,,"The excursion included transportation to the zoo, a chinese and indian buffet, tour of the night animals, animal show and fire throwers . The food was ok but the restraurant was not air conditioned so we found ourselves eating with the animals (insects).
As you would expect some of the animals were out of view, choosing not to be where the lights were. The open vehicle we took the tour of the animals in had a running commentary in English. The animal show was entertaining with snakes, otters and various other animals. The young men throwing flames were very skilled and involved a willing member of the audience. The smell of petrol was overwhelming and a little scary. One things for sure these lads are going to have health problems sooner or later. Over all good value for money."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,Night Safari was the best experience I had in Singapore. The place immerses you in nature and I felt I was in the middle of a jungle. Gives me goosebumps just thinking about it!
,,Last Christmas trip with family,5.0,,My 5 year old son thoroughly enjoyed the night safari. We got to see mostly all the animals and other entertaining programs . My son liked their fruit flavours slush drinks served in long length transparent bottles having different animal characters on bottle caps.
,,Enjoyable Family Outing,4.0,,"We were very excited and went there even before the attraction was open for the evening. There was already a very long queue. But within minutes of its opening, we were already ushered in. The staff are very well organised and experienced in managing the overwhelming crowd.

We went directly to join the queue (yes another queue) for the tram ride, again, they are more than prepared to manage the crowd size. In less than 20 minutes, we were on our way around the Night Safari, spotting all the fascinating wildlife to the left and right of the trail.

My family enjoyed every bit of it, except for a small issue that we faced, which is no fault of the park at all. My toddler daughter needed the restroom just 5 minutes into the tram ride, which took more than 40 minutes in total. So here's a tip, go to the restrooms before you join the queue for the tram ride."
,,Great night Zoo,5.0,,"Excellent entertainment at night. Lots of animals and the effect of being at night are stunning. A real treat, for young and less young."
,,Kids loved it,4.0,,Kids loved it. Should change the act. Good foof but pricy. Most animals shy away. Something different.
,,More than we expected,5.0,,We started the safari when it opened at 7:15 and ended up spending about 4 hours there. The animals were great to see without feeling like they were in captivity.
,,Keep in mind you will need to wait!,3.0,,We arrived at Night Safari after a fairly long cab ride. Got in line to purchase tickets and then was told we couldn't go in for another 90 minutes. With the time change the last thing we wanted to do is wait another hour and a half. Night Zoo was excellent but wished we would have gone earlier so wouldn't have had such a short visit.
,,More hype less safari,3.0,,"Night safari is over rated tour as there is hardly anything,except average flame throwing show & train ride,souvenir shops."
,,Ok but it is famous,3.0,,I went to the night safari. The tram ride is about 40 minutes. Besides that not much to do. The food stalls is kind of casual fast food and is overpriced.
,,Safari sand animals,3.0,,We went there on the first day of our trip with lot of excitement but it was a complete let down The train is ok and not many animals to see.. it is only for family with children
,,Fun but Busy,5.0,,"We were on a tour and it wasvery crowded. We waited 2 hours in line. Other days it is ten minutes...it is a crap shoot. You never know when it will be so busy.. It drove our guide to distraction as she saw her tips disappearing with each minute more of waiting! We did not blame her, but some did. Be kind! Having been on safari in Kenya, this was ho hum, but to others it was wonderful!"
,,Great experience,4.0,,"The Night Safari is a Zoo, but not just as any other zoo. You have a different experience seeing the animals at night, when they feel more active. Great structure and nice presentations / shows as well."
,,Love it!,5.0,,As a child I loved going on the night safari and my love of it hasn't changed as an adult. I would recommend anyone visiting Singapore to visit the Night Safari
,,Outstanding Experience,5.0,,"A must visit place with your family and friends, where you see Lions and many more just few meters far from you. Its actually an unbelievable experience."
,,Night safari review,3.0,,The evening show before proceeding for night safari was good. Night safari is done by sitting in the tram which takes you inside the zoo for about 40 minutes.Can be avoided if you are doing Singapore zoo.Hadindian dinner at Ulu UluRestaurant inside the Zoo which was fantastic. Overall the safari was Ok.
,,Great experience with the kids,5.0,,"The kids loved visiting the Night Safari.. The tram that takes you around the park is great, with audio explaining everything as you go. And then being able to walk the tracks around the park afterwards is great for a better look. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Good be ridiculously busy,4.0,,"Really enjoyed the night safari, the only negative things I can say is that it's way way to popular (I'm sure the zoo sees this as a positive) so it makes lining up for the tram for instance a very long very hot wait. Then you only really catch quick glimpses of the animals because you are constantly moving and because they don't want to disturb the animals extra there is minimal light to see them with (which I agree is what they both need to do and should do) but it can limit your ability to see the animals sometimes.

It is a great night though and we'll worth doing at least once on one of your visits to Singapore.

Oh take plenty of money though, the food and drink is definitely excessively priced."
,,Amazing animals - a great nighttime experience,5.0,,"We arrived just after the night museum opened and went to see the show first. After that we did the walking trail and the animals were all really awake. The train ride was also excellent and you different animals. We would recommend doing both the walking trails and taking the tram!
Excellent experience which I would recommend for people of any age!"
,,A unique animal experience,4.0,,"I visited the Night Safari once as a teenager more than 15 years ago and never sought to visit again because I slept my way through it. Now married with kids, the Husband got curious and we went again last night. I'm happy to say that I managed to stay awake this time and that we would be visiting again in the near future (as annual pass holders).

The Night Safari opens its gates at 5.30pm. The dining outlets and gift stores open first so you could go in and browse and eat overpriced tourist food ($18 for a not very appetizing burger? Come onnnn!). On Friday and Saturday nights, there is the spectacular Thumbuakar fire show that takes place near Bongo Burgers. The park itself doesn't open till 7.15pm.

It appears that they've implemented timed entries into the park, I suppose as a measure to manage the crowds. I heard the staff reminding visitors that only those with the 7.15pm tickets can go in first. A large crowd builds up around the entrance, making the atmosphere a little frenzied. But unless you're going during a very busy period, take a chill pill and relax :)

Once the park opens, the visitors pour in and immediately make a beeline for the trams. I wouldn't blame them, since they are the first thing you see. However, thanks to tips from other visitors (yaay TripAdvisor), we opted to hit the walking trail first. It was a good 45 minutes before we actually met anyone else on the trail, to the point where we got quite spooked out.

Good walking shoes are a must, dress light and if you're prone to bites, lather on that mosquito repellent. It's the rainy season currently, so it was relatively cooler (still humid) but I imagine it can get a tad unbearable if you come during the warmer nights.

On the walking trails, you'll get to see many of the smaller animals like the mousedeer, flying fox and porcupines as well as some of the larger mammals like the tiger, hyenas (they were very interested in my son sitting on his daddy's shoulders) and leopards. It took us almost 1.5 hours to complete the trails and by then, the crowd for the trams had thinned out and the walking trails were starting to get noisy.

The tram takes you to the rest of the park, where you can see the rhinos and elephants (much bigger than the ones at the Zoo). It's about 40 minutes with a guided commentary and only 2 stops (?). You literally drive THROUGH the enclosure itself, and come up quite close with the animals.

There is an animal show but we gave it a miss because we were kinda tired. Need more practice to refine our timings.

Also, be sure to empty those bladders before going. There are only 2 toilets in the park, one at the entrance and another at the Zebra Cafe (45 minutes walk or 20 by tram). They are large and clean. There is a water fountain outside the toilet at the Zebra Cafe.

The animals were a little more active than those at the zoo (although we caught the leopards snoozing away for all to see) but it is a little dark (duh) so be sure to get those Vit A supplements before you visit lol. Not sure why anyone bothers trying to snap pics because I'll doubt they'd be able to see anything!"
,,fun,5.0,,The night safari is really fun! We really liked their shows and the tour. Unfortunately many of the animals were already asleep.
,,As good as the Singapore Zoo,5.0,,"Check out the nocturnal animals that are presented at Night Safari. You can go there with friends, family or on a date... Food isn't best."
,,Lack the wow factor,3.0,,"Went several years ago and was very impressed, but my wife had never been, so decided to go agin. Booked a tour with dinner. Strip out in bus was slow due to heavy traffic. Dinner was an asian buffet. Regular price posted at $45, but promotion $32. Very few people there , so food seemed to out for a while.Compared to other venues was very average.
Had skip the line ticket for train, but no que at all.
Was raining slightly at times but animals were hard to see, different to my last visit. The guide was hard to understand. The leopard walk would have been very crowded if the number of visitors the venue can cater for were present."
,,Slightly disappointing night zoo experience,3.0,,"Zoo gets very very crowded for the nightly experience, so be prepared for a long queying.
We got tucked into a train-like wheeler for a tour around the zoo. What we saw was fairly limited, although this was an interesting experiences do not expect any surprises over animals (having visited many zoos around the world). Meals and drinks are really expensive. Overall zoo is well-organized and they seem to keep crowds well in control."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,This is 1 experience that everybody should have atleast once in there life....riding in tram in night in open and you get to see animals in open...just amazing...must visit
,,Dont miss !!!,5.0,,Night safari is experiencing the wild life in night and not in cage... Do walk on a trail first... Then board the tram.... The most valued experience is walking through their trail...
,,Not a great place if you are coming from wild country :-),3.0,,"Well, I have travelled extensively in India. So you can imagine my lack of enthusiasm when I saw the ""Indian buffalo"", ""Indian Elephant"", ""Indian bull"", ""Indian that"", ""Indian this"" in the Singapore zoo. Its nice to see so many ""Indian"" things here - but hey, not so fun for perhaps the largest foreign racial demographic visiting the Singapore Zoo."
,,Interesting but perhaps not as dramatic as one would like,3.0,,Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations - while there was a range of animals from a variety of countries - the viewing areas were often cramped due to the volumes of people and animals difficult to see - the inability to take flash photography made photography nearly impossible. While it is perfectly understandable that the animals welfare is paramount more could be done to enhance the visitors' experience. The take away food for once was reasonably priced. Access on tour buses is easy though taxis are relatively inexpensive.
,,Awesome!!!,5.0,,Another Singapore genius magic. The fact that we could see the animals.Going through the park in the night train and the variety of attractions within the park makes this a great night outing.
,,Nothing that much at the night zoo,3.0,,"I went there for a walk and even take their tram to see animals at night. Nothing much there and no excitement. Animals there are very tiring because of us disturb them.

Better to go for day time where animals can perform.

Can recommend to bring your family along with kids so that kids will have enjoyment"
,,Hot but was awesome!,5.0,,"We had no idea what to expect but it was great! Super steamy after a rain but they had a fire show before we entered the park. Before you Tal the team tour be sure and see the night creature show. It's about an hour long and has some great animals. But when they say no flash people, don't use a flash. They had to take animals back early cause someone couldn't follow the rules. I had no idea what to expect in the tram ride but it was awesome. The animals were so close and great to view. I was so amazed how real their habitats look. Their is one stop you can get off and do some walking. But overall it is well worth the trip."
,,Pay the extra for the private tour it is worth it,5.0,,Fantastic experience. Took the private tour which was pricey but very glad we did as the queues for the trains for the standard tour were unbelievably long. The guide was amazing and extremely knowledgeable and it was pleasing to hear of their conservation and educational efforts in Singapore and beyond. Unique opportunity to see the behavior of animals at night 10 out of 10
,,Animals in their natural habitat,4.0,,Experiencing wild animals in their natural habitat was amazing. One must not miss the fire dancers at the entry at any cost.
,,Nice experience but crowded,4.0,,"We went here, 2 adults and 2 kids, after a full day at the Zoo. It's a nice experience, and a bit creepy to walk the paths in the dark, and listen to all the animals. When the park opens there is a ridiculously long line to enter. We tried to wait it out, but eventually had to que up like everybody else.
A tip is to walk the left way round the park as you enter, as most people seem to walk to the right or que up for the tram rides. This gave us the opportunity to walk through half the park all by ourselves.
If your time is tight and you're deciding between this and the Zoo. Go for the Zoo."
,,This is the for the night safari,3.0,,Who would think there would be so many people at the zoo at night. Being that singapore is so damn hot it sucks even more when you have to line up and there are hundreds of people in line sweating waiting for the trains. You cant really see much being that it is a night safari. I think the concept is cool but would be much better if you could actually see the animals. The show they had was ok but super corny at the same time. I took my family here in hopes of keeping my son entertained. Instead he couldnt see anything got bored and fell asleep. I guess it all worked out after all.
,,Definitely worth a visit!,4.0,,"We did not go the zoo during the day, we chose to experience it only through the night safari. We chose the 8:15pm departure and it took roughly 20 minutes in the queue before we boarded the tram. The tour itself was great, the only let down was the extremely loud passengers talking over the top of the narration and using their flash cameras which detracted from what should have been a very peaceful and unique experience - but we understand that this would be difficult to control. A return taxi from the city cost us around $55 however I believe there are other transport options available. Definitely worth a visit if you have the time!

Tip: We arrived at 7:30pm and stood around waiting as we had the 8:15pm tickets. Turns out we could have wandered up at any time, so if you arrive early it is worth heading up to the tram area and joining the queue."
,,Packs your night with quiet wonders,5.0,,"It's basically a zoo without lights.
I'm an annual pass holder to the Singapore Zoo, Singapore Night Safari and Singapore River Safari.

I frequently visit the Night Safari (NS) and can share some experiences here.
--Firstly, the animals will not be in near view all the time, and you may not even get to see some of them at times. They are animals and are allowed to roam a rather big area for most of them, so they are naturally not inclined to stay in a certain visible spot at all times. So don't get frustrated and angry and blame the NS for what they cannot control if you don't get to see an animal or two you so very much desire to. Just re-visit that location after a while. The animals are not gone...they are just out of sight.
--Secondly, it can get very humid and warm at night as you walk the trails, so apply insect repellent, dress light but make sure you wear long pants as there may be mosquitoes, insects, bats freely roaming around. Honestly, take a moment or two to concentrate looking above you and you'll notice there are many many free roaming bats everywhere, and you'll almost never see a bird at all. So if you're afraid of bats...stick close to your group as they DO tend to swoop down on the paths at times randomly, but trust me, they are not targeting you, they are just random.
--Thirdly, never provoke any animal there. They are there as part of a conservation effort by WRS, as well as to be put on proud display to the public to enjoy the marvels of them. If you can't help tapping or banging on glass panels or cooing at the animals or even trying to reach your hand out or throw something at them...do the world a favour and don't visit in the first place. The animals can and will retaliate as much as possible, and you'll get all angry that WRS doesn't do its part to keep you safe because you can't help mistreating the animals...?
-Fourthly, walk the trails first then take the tram and finish it off with the Creatures of the Night show. As the first thing you will encounter when you enter the park is the main tram station (Tram Station A), almost all guests will be there queueing up, causing a massive long queue as it's the most convenient thing to do first. Also, visibility gets worse as you progress deeper into the night, so it's always better to see all the animals first by walking.
To add on to the trams, if the night is still early around 7.40+, or if the sky is still well lit or not dark, the trams will not operate till then, so if you do decide to queue or even get on the tram, they will not start it until when appropriate.
--Fifthly, you will want to get your own food and especially drinks into the park, as there is nowhere to buy any form of refreshment unless at the East Lodge station where there is a little cafeteria, which usually doesn't stay open for long. It's not a good idea to be without water for quite a while while walking and deep in the trails.

Enjoy the bats

,,Great evening activity - a little out of the way to reach,5.0,,"The night safari is a great evening activity, fairly expensive and a little out of the way to reach. Nevertheless a wonderful experience. Riding the tram it's easy to forget that the animals are not actually walking freely. Well designed"
,,One time visit!,3.0,,I somehow don't like the idea of wild animals being showcased and also don't understand what is done for them to be just standing while safari is going on. Would be more inclined to see the animals in a less controlled environment.
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,Be here early as it tends to crowd up pretty fast. Our Guide Damien was very entertaining. However please do avoid photography if you dont know how to switch off your flash.
,,Great way to see nocturnal animals,5.0,,"I have been to many zoos, but this one is worth the visit for something different. The best tip we got was to walk the zoo first and do the show and tram ride at the end to avoid the crowds, which are huge. The animals appear well cared for and the enclosures are great, you sometimes feel there is nothing between the animals and you."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Dont understand why some people were disappointed. This is a chance to see animals without the barrier of cage. No you can't tale photographs because you are viewing animals in what is in effect moonlight (thats the level of the lighting) and flash photography would disturb the animals. We saw most of the animals but when you go to a zoo you are not guaranteed to see all of the animals anyway. I would recommend taking a taxi there and back and booking the tram ride in advance. You may still have to queue but not for long and there is always the fire dancers to watch if you get there early enough. i would also recommend getting off the tram after the first round the park trip at one of the walks. The bats are amazing and you can get within inches of them. I would love to go again.
,,An overrated Safari,2.0,,"This was highly recommended, but our 2 teenage grandsons, budding photographers were hugely disappointed. Animal appearances a hit and miss - by the time you spot them you have passed them. Disappointment all around."
,,Great evening in Singapore,5.0,,"We had been told the crowds are very large on Friday and Saturday nights so opted to go on a Thursday night and found the crowds bearable.
We had been told to wait until after 8pm when a lot of families have gone home but I would suggest this doesn't leave a lot of time to fully enjoy the exhibits.
The tram tour was good and seeing the animals so close was amazing, I would probably do the shows and then the walking tour and leave the tram until late as there was virtually no one left on the trams after 10.30pm.
We caught the local bus which was quick and easy and only cost $2.70.
The food and souvenirs are expensive but this is to be expected in a tourist area."
,,did the night safari - well worth seeing.,4.0,,Decided to take a trip to the night safari. Wasn't sure about it but it was well worth seeing. Lots of walking but lots to see and do. We missed the show but had fun travelling through the many areas. A few different places to go to eat and stalls with ice cream and shops
,,Disappointed,1.0,,"I have been to the Singapore Zoo many times over the years and have loved it, however, I was very very disappointed with the Night Safari. I queued with my young children for 1.5 hours only to board a train for a seemingly very short ride. We saw few animals. Really was a wasted evening. It was by the way, very expensive; admission was over the top and the limited food places were outrageous. I would not recommend this as a must see when you come to Singapore"
,,Well managed park with long queues,4.0,,"We arrived here by taxi in rush hour traffic from Sentosa Island - big mistake. Not only did it take much longer than expected, it was also more expensive for a similar ride at other times of the day. Strangely enough, with such a touristy hot spot on Sentosa Island, there is no direct or easier way to travel to this part of the island state.

We arrived just before opening time and was amazed at the number of people and tour groups already present at the ticket counters and at the gate. The staff manning the ticket counters were most helpful and knowledgeable, kudos to them.

The first stop we went was an open-air show. Perfect timing as we didn't have to wait long (ie the first show starts around 15 mins after the gate opens). The MC was very good and entertaining, engaged everyone throughout the show and created a good atmosphere for the rest of the evening.

Then came the surprise (and disappointment). By the end of the show, long queues have already started forming at the train terminus. Granted, the staff tried their very best to get the waiting time to within acceptable limits but with a 5 year old child, the heat and stifling environs was not pleasant. (Did we miss the fast track option or was there none available?) Once boarded the train, the ride was very smooth, both informative and educational and was actually well-worth the waiting time.

Sadly, by this time of the evening our daughter was already drenched and very tired after a whole day out, we didn't get to see much of the park per se nor did we have a change to try the F&B outlets.

I couldn't help but notice that tour groups were whisked away onto the trains from different points of embarkation. Whether they had priority, I did not know but it is something worth finding out should one decide to visit with young children."
,,Ok,3.0,,Couldnt see all the animals and couldn't take good pics but the show after the safari was enjoyable. Definitely more comfortable as far as tempreture was concerned due to it being during the night.
,,We spent good time with natural animals.,4.0,,"We spent good time at this place.
The way to this place is somehow far ( ex. from Ochard by MRT and local bus,, around 50min)

We saw animals who acted their natural behavior than the zoo where animals are devided by metal gages.

We are japanese, so we choose japanese language tram,( if you are mandarin, you could also choose mandarin language tram)

However, the tram for english guide was so crowded, it would be good for people who want to ride english tram to book admissio and tram tikets in advance!"
,,"If you have visited other zoos, do not waste your time..",1.0,,"This has been appreciated by many but if you have already been to other good zoo and watched animals in the open or even in the cage, then don't even think of wasting your time here. You practically find animals are half dead, no fun, long queues, absolute waste of time and money."
,,"Interesting to see, but not a must do",4.0,,"It was a cool experience to do a night safari however there were many animals there that you would find at any other zoo. At night it was all about the unique experience rather than taking pictures of the animals. It was cool to see the animals up close though opposed to all behind really close/confined cages. Most o the animals were free roaming around and people were able to walk about the paths (or ride the trolly) and see the animals crossing the very path in front of you. The animal show is not worth going, they have three or four animals that they show, however it is nothing special. I took the MRT and connected via bus for roughtly $5 USD. The entrance fee was about $42, however there were packages if you choose to combine the zoo package etc. I was told the bus runs until 11pm, however the park is open until midnight. Taxi's run 24/7 though and are relatively inexpensive/comparable to US taxi prices."
,,boring,2.0,,i heard so many good reviews and after waiting in a long queue you get in a bus and all you see is mainly buffalo and dear and thats it
,,Interesting,4.0,,We went on the Night Safari which was very good but afterwards chaos reined when everyone tried to get back to the coaches - an excellent tour!
,,"Too crowded, a little over hyped",3.0,,"Had heard a lot about the night safari, but came back with a mixed feeling. The guidebook told us to take a bus from an MRT station. The bus ride is too lengthy and i took us 30 minutes from the MRT to reach the place. So, if you are taking an MRT, please do take a taxi. The crowd was overwhelming and we had to wait for the 8.30 pm show, when the crowd had moderated. The show was ok-ok, and reminded you a lot about the old day circus. It was definitely not worth the wait. The tram ride was good and we enjoyed our sights of the animals in the night. That was the part which was worth it."
,,Great Evening,4.0,,We did an organised night safari tour.It was good.If you could get there by yourself it would be better as you would have more time.The night hours are 7.30pm-11.00pm.The food is abit exspensive $13 for an ice cream
,,Overrated,2.0,,"OK, maybe I am not part of the target demographic for the night ""safari"", after having been on safaris in both India and South Africa, and I was admittedly a bit skeptical already when we headed to the zoo.

Our experience started by queuing for 75 minutes before getting on the tram that was going to take us around the park. When I asked a member of the staff if there was something not working right that evening causing delays and long queues, I got the reply that nothing was out of the ordinary.

The actual tram ride took about 40 minutes, and we were shown a cavalcade of lethargic or apathetic animals in small enclosures modeled to look like their natural habitats, the white lions being the highlight. Maybe the standard is high for being a zoo, but these animals deserve so much better!

If you only have a few days in Singapore, I am sure there are many more worth while activities you could spend you time on."
,,Rare close to extinct species on display,5.0,,"The night experience and species on display makes for a surreal experience (ie; a mammoth like species of elephant was one of the most memorable sights i got, i thought i could never seen one like that only in the antartic."
,,Not adventerous at all,2.0,,"After passing through a long queue what u get to see is pigs, cows, buffaloes which we can see on Indian roads n why visit singapore for this. One may skip this activity which would save around 5-6 hrs which can be used else where in singapore as there are many other attractions worthy."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,There is a fire show organized at the entrance which is fabulous. There is a cabby in which we got to travel in the park. It was an enjoyable experience with friends or family.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Definitely worth the time and effort in taking your young one for a night stroll. For parents with prams, when you board the tram make sure you request and physically see the staff put your pram on the tram to avoid the disappointment of taking a stroll at a stopover."
,,Unique experience and must visit place,5.0,,"Most of the animals of the world can been seen in this place. It open in evening at 7:30 PM. One can take train tramp or go by walk (both have different routes). I would recommend you take both, first take train and complete whole round around the park and then go by walking to have closer look. Before the safari opens there's also great fire show which one can enjoy."
,,Thrilling Experience...,5.0,,Night Safari is one of a kind attraction in Singapore...Amazing experience of visiting a zoo under moon light....the train takes you through the entire zoo and experience the natural habitat of animals. Taking pictures is not allowed so that animals are not disturbed. If you are lucky you can see lions/tigers walking just besides you.
,,Tram ride in the dark,4.0,,"We were part of a large tour group doing the Night Safari so it was quite different than doing a solo visit. We loaded onto the tram (and it was accessible for wheelchairs) and rode off into the darkness with a guide to point out the animals. There were lots of big and small animals but the tram kept rolling on. The general public had hop on hop off privilege and it would have been really neat to be able to watch some of the animals at length. Rhino, hippo, lions, white lions, giraffe, hyenas, deer, mountain goats. Tiger at the end but we couldn't see it. Restrooms at the zoo are really neat with open air greenery but still privacy."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"This is a unique attraction where you see and hear the animals and sounds of the night. Take the tram ride, its very informative. We waiting 2 hours on the line but didn't actually get in this time as it was Chinese New year and many many people visit here. The entertainment while you queue such as the dragon dancers and musicians that happens while you are queuing makes the wait very entertaining, so it wasn't a wasted trip. You can go into the zoo at night without doing the safari, but I highly recommend the safari as we have done it previously and will try again on our next visit."
,,Left feeling underwhelmed,3.0,,"Been told by many people that this was a must see if In Singapore

Well we saw and wouldn't want to see again. A succession of mountain goats and deer with the odd bigger species thrown in. I think we probably missed out on a lot by taking the tram ride so my recommendation would be to walk round I am sure you would see more. Had the meal and it was a good standard"
,,Special Evening,5.0,,"We booked this and didn't really know what to expect. One thing I would say is do not go for the food. There were a couple of the large groups who had booked and they were in the restaurants before us and essentially there was no food left. The coffee was awful and the only decent beverage to drink was beer - hard luck if you don't touch it. A great pity as you obviously pay for this in your ticket and I would rather have had a prepacked sandwich and a can of soft drink rather than what was offered.

Apart from that the evening was magical. We embarked on this as a private tour and our guide was well informed, well educated in animal husbandry (was a vet) and had excellent english. We travelled around the who place and whenever we got close to the large animals they were being fed to ensure they moved or were close to the glass for our benefit. We saw everything is a relaxed and enjoyable timeframe with our driver communicating ahead to tell them where we were so as to ensure it all went smoothly. As you are in a golf buggy you cover a large ground area so see all the various sections and are not tired or difficulty in see from he larger ""trains"". The highlight had to be feeing the elephants and it will be something which will stay with me for an age.

A great treat for someone special regardless of age. In fact in the dark it gives you the ability to hide little and feel like a child again and live in awe of the beauty of these animals."
,,Unlike anything before,4.0,,"Really enjoyed taking a tram through the rainforest at 9pm- perfect time to be outside and it's something you don't do everyday! You also get the opportunity to go for a walk through the exhibits to see the animals you don't see on the team ride. Only advice is to take some food with you or eat beforehand, and of course take plenty of water. Unforgettable experience"
,,creepy attraction,4.0,,"This is a new way of discover animals. The dark of the night makes it a bit creepy, as you go into places with diferent birds and to- and four-legged animals is going and flying in your way You can tutch them, and have to go around them. The trip vith the tram is also special in the dark of the night"
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"I have done mny zoos and unzoos, but the night zoo was a fun treat. Getting to see the nocturnal animals while they were awake was a lot of fun. And being somewhere exotic like Singapore while doing it was even better. Big thumbs up for this!"
,,"Good but not great, can do away with this",3.0,,"It's a long 45min ride to Night Safari from the city. But lots of tourists go here to experience seeing animals in the rainforest.

The tour is organized despite the throng of visitors. Tours start at 715pm. The tram doesn't have side covers so make sure kids are seated in the middle. Animals can freely move in their ""stations"" which are open (not cages) except for the tiger (its area has a see through barrier for safety).

The guide was okay and but not amazing (the recorded guide/voice over didn't work due to technical difficulties so one of the staff had to do the tour for us).

You will have to go down the trails to see more animals. Can be boring sometimes.

Food and souvenirs are overpriced as expected."
,,"Smaller, but still good",5.0,,"I've never really understood just how easily a tiger can hunt a human until I visited here!

When you go to other zoos in the day, all the animals are asleep. Here, at night, they are wide awake and pacing through their lairs. Watching these cats awake is a totally different experience and really interesting.

The enclosures mimic a forest, with the bamboo and everything, so to see these cats (or not see them...it is amazing how orange and black stripes go invisible in the jungle at night) really lets you feel what these magnificent creatures are capable of.

Again, don't miss the feeding times, especially for the lions who tend to be aloof at all other times. The zookeepers are really passionate and happy to share their knowledge with the tourists.

(we spoke with the lady who looked after the tiger and she told us lots about the tiger. The tiger also kept looking out through the crowd to see where the zookeeper was, and listening to her voice and calling out to her whenever she heard her speak, so its nice to see that the animals have a good relationship with their keepers)

Besides the big cats, tons of small animals to steal your hearts. I literally could not be torn away from the funny little otters. So Cute.

Pro Tip: Get there EARLY. book tickets in advance and start queuing 15 mins before it opens. Make sure you are one of the first 100 or so in and head straight to the animal show so that you don't miss it. (unfortunately we did as the ticket said three shows a night, but we didnt realise that was only for weekends.) Better to catch the show first then take your time seeing the rest."
,,Busy park,3.0,,Very interesting open zoo type park. Go on guided tour or the queues will have you waiting for lenghty periods which is not pleasant in the heat with or without children. Didn't watch the entertainment supplied after the train. Went for an independent walk which was lovely and quiet.
,,A jewel in Singapore's crown,5.0,,"The Night Safari has almost universal appeal. Most visitors love it. If you are at a loose end at night, this may be one thing to do. Animals behave differently at night, they are fascinatring."
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,I found the night safari to be disappointing as there were not many animals to bee seen. You catch a train which slowly travels the pathway with a commentary provided.
,,Night zoo,5.0,,"Great evening - stay on the team or get off for a walk. Had to wait for ticket times so possibly better to pre book. Taxi rank at end of night had very long queue but kept moving ok so wait not ol too bad.
Really interesting and different zoo experience ."
,,Went on the Night Safari & found it dissapointing!,3.0,,"The ""Night Safari"" is very well publicised & is a major attraction at the Zoo. Having previously had a ""Real Safari"" in South Africa we didn't really know what to expect, we found it over commercialised and a bit ""cheesy"". I understand that some of the funding goes to help endangered species of animals - it was to me however quite un-natural & cannot recommend it!"
,,Interesting but long transportation time,4.0,,"This is our first time to visit the zoo at night. Quite interesting! Some of animals are sleeping during night time so that we cannot see all of animals.
I think the animal show is worth to attend. We just stay 2 hours inside the zoo after dinner at downtown. If you want to visit this attraction, please consider about the transportation time and not recommend to take bus no.138. Taxi or Coach is better!"
,,Visit 4 times within 2 years - love it!,5.0,,"I visited Night safari, River safari, Zoo - bought packages together with bird park - totally love it! Good place to visit alone, couples, family, friends. Animals are well groomed, friendly staff."
,,Very Good tour,4.0,,"We booked the ""Skip-the-Line: Priority Tram Boarding at Night Safari with Buffet Dinner"" through viator. At $91 it was good considering it included hotel pick-up and drop-off in air conditioned coach, entrance fees, buffet dinner, tram and almost 2 shows.
The journey there was good and you got to see alot of Singapore by night. The guide was entertaining and well organised. Holding a blue light she moved quickly ahead of you through the crowd and at times perhaps a bit too fast.
Once inside the zoo we moved (quickly) to the buffet area. The food here was excellent. Then you had the choice to go to the fire show or keep eating. Fire show was great.
Next it was on to the trams, the skip-the-line idea was great and definitely worth it. Ride was good and informative. Some animals were difficult to see but mostly enjoyable. No flash photography is permitted.
At the end of the ride we went to the creatures of the night show. This was good but slow moving. As we had to be back at the bus at 10pm we had to leave and didn't see the whole show.
Only downside to this tour was that it was a bit too rushed. Keeping up with the blue light and missing some of the last show were the only things that stopped it being excellent!
Did I say the buffet was excellent? Yes, worth saying again!"
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"The Night Safari (or Night Zoo as some call it) was really hyped up for us even before we arrived in Singapore, so we got the package ""deal"" with zoo tickets. Waiting to get in was painfully long. Not worth it. We did not see the animal show, but did take the really long tram ride which was, honestly pretty boring. We saw a few animals, but ya' know, it's NIGHT, and it's hard to see, and the animals might or might not be out. Lots of walking, and you had to double back the way you came to get out, there really isn't an efficient circular path, which there should be.

The worst was the bathrooms at the entrance. The only time in Singapore, or the Middle East, or Europe where I've been in an absolutely disgusting bathroom. Horrifying, really.
And a very long bus/taxi ride back to downtown Singapore, so not really any choice. When I told staff, they seemed unconcerned."
,,Good way to see this amazing City at Night,4.0,,"We booked this tour from the UK a while before we went to Singapore and we were not disappointed, the food vouchers which was dinner, were interesting, 5 dollars each and sent to the food market next door to the offices...lots to choose from..you just put more money towards it! But our guide was amazing,she gave us so much information on this fabulous city, and we managed to see everything we had wanted to see.... this tour was the one that took us to the night show, music and light at the Bays..fantabulous!!!"
,,It wasn't worth it,2.0,,Waited in the queue for a long time and was quite disappointing with the limited things they offered.
,,Night Ride - Singaporian Pride,5.0,,A must visit for all tourist visiting Singapore. The entire experience of seeing the animals so closely was a delight.
,,"Another ""not-to-miss"" thing to do in Singapore",5.0,,"Opening at 6.30pm the Zoo is easy to reach by public transport. It offers you a wonderful chance to see the nocturnal animals active, instead of like stuffed animals in a far corner at day. You can see the whole garden by small trains and, if you like even walk it. It is a rare and beautiful experience!"
,,"Great experience, great tram open air ride and shows !!",5.0,,"This attraction is great for kids, parents and even individuals. The close proximity to animals is amazing, to the extent you feel like touching them. The restaurant selection outside also serves great food, including the Ulu Ulu restaurant buffet. Overall, a must do."
,,Night safari disappointment,1.0,,"It is really sad that an organisation that prides itself on supposed conservation has forced the elephants to take part in the night safari.
My partner and I were both appalled at the abnormal behavior of the elephants on the night safari. All the elephants were exhibiting obsessive rocking behavior while standing in one spot. We both actually checked for chains on the elephants as their behavior was so strange.
Either remove the elephants from this display or let them behave in a normal manner."
,,Better if in the Morning,4.0,,"I really appreciated the animals at night. Unfortunately, I haven't seen them well because the park was too dark and it was prohibited to spot a bright light directly to the animals. We also have to minimize too much noise so as not to disturb the sleeping animals. So, it;s more advisable to go there during daylight."
,,It was waste if you are animal lover,2.0,,"It is a three part safari experience. There was a fire show and that was nice. An animal show which was not as world class and the worst was the main event riding a safari cart. You cannot have views of animals clearly and it is so small that you feel that your hard earned money have wasted.
It cost 20 Singaporean dollar per person. It's not worth it.
There is no value for money."
,,Rare Species of animals spotted,5.0,,A must go to this night safari. Their i spotted so many species of animals and they all were taken good care of by the officials over there.
,,Excellent place,5.0,,Nice place to visit with children. Learning about animals is always my passion. You can see a lot of animals living in open.
,,Fantastic,4.0,,This is well worth doing.We went on a tour which was good .If you make your own way there you could spend 3hours where we could only spend 2.The food is expensive an ice cream was $13 singapore
,,"""""""""It's ok""""""""",3.0,,"Night safari was recommend by friends and took my wife and 2 year old while visiting Singapore for the F1. It's interesting but during the tour many of animals were not visible, nevertheless it's a decent experience!"
,,Authentic experience,4.0,,Do watch the fire show before entering the safari. The queue does get long. I suggest taking both the walking and the tram trails. Be ready to walk and spend time. Photography to be avoided until and unless u have a good camera for low light. Carry water while walking.
,,great experience,4.0,,good to visit especially after sunset.. cause by then the weather wouldnt be that hot and humid. Did our company's event there and arranged for dinner on tram! we truly enjoyed ourselves
,,A Fun Evening,4.0,,"Spent one night at the night Zoo.
Although its expensive its worth the experience
You travel in little trains and see many different types of animals along the way.
There are also several shows included in the admission.
The food at the zoo are very expensive"
,,Lovely Eveing,5.0,,"This is a lovely way to spend an evening. The night zoo opens for you to visit the animals roaming around and you travel in a small safari tram. There are also areas where you can get out of the tram and look at some animals up close, I would recommend looking at the bats. It is a really nice experience to see the animals and the grounds are very nice and spacious."
,,Night life,5.0,,"Went here on there nighttime safari tour, it is definitely a different way to see the animals. You go round the zoo on land train and view the animals by use of light magnifying glasses allowing you to see them in natural environment"
,,Customer service is great,5.0,,"Ogy is great and did her best to book a car for us. Also she suggested us for other ways for the same route. Other staff are also nice and gave us recommendations on a better way to visit the zoo.
The zoo is worth to be visited if you do not have much time. You can see lots of animals in the tram. You can also have a very close look to the animals in walking trails.

Overall a perfect place to be visited."
,,Average tour with average view.,3.0,,"This is my first kind of night safari. Expectations were very high but I think they were not fulfilled.

Took 7:15 Ticket and it was very crowded. It took me almost 30 min to get into the tram.

Although I appreciate the number of trams they have setup. 40 min tram journey starts and you expect a lot from this but you only get is variety of deers,some elephants and only one white lion.

Animal show was also mediocre and nothing to eat for vegetarians.

I would suggest to include some more new attraction in the park."
,,a different experience,4.0,,"entry to the night safari opens at 7pm and I would recommend getting there 20 minutes early to avoid the long queues. go on the tram ride first which takes about 40 minutes. It is good and some animals can only be seen exclusively by the tram, there is no walking access. Then go see the night time show, its ok not great. After you have the rest of the time to explore the zoo at your own pace. There are 4 different walking trails which should take about 20 minutes each. its a very different experience walking through the zoo at night and it is good because a lot of the animals are very active compared to the day time. They also have a lot of animals in the night safari that they don't have in the zoo e.g. white lion, sloth bear, fishing cat (which you can watch hunting) to name a few. Sometimes animals can be hard to spot in their enclosures because it is dark after all. The last bus runs into the city at 11pm for $5 which is handy because the MRT stops running around 11pm and you have to get the bus first which takes 30 or 40 minutes just to the MRT station. So it allows you a little bit more time in the park as well as being only 20 minutes to the city compared to 1h 30m using public transport."
,,Good Night Activity,3.0,,"I enjoyed this attraction. It is next to the regular zoo, so we spent the afternoon at the zoo, had dinner outside after closing & before the night safari opened. unfortunately it was so packed there were huge queues everywhere with tour groups getting priority so we walked to the lion & tiger feedings. The show with the nocturnal animals was quite good but was only a disappointing 15 minutes long after having to wait 30+ minutes to get in. Overall it was a good experience, but one not worth repeating."
,,A bit below expetaction,3.0,,"Premesis: the staff and the structure are absolutely top-class.
Night Safari is one of the main atraction in Singapore but I absolutely prefer the Singapore's zoo.
Animals are well taken care, with a cage-free habitat. The only problem is that you can see very few of them, or maybe it was just an unlucky night. Obviusly flash light are forbidden and since you are on a moving truck, forget long exposure pictures.
Facility and transport make the place easy access. Restaurants are a bit overcharged (like every restaurant near by main attraction all around the world)
Can visit once....not twice"
,,VERY RELAXING AND COOL,5.0,,A very nice ending to our hectic holiday relaxing and cool on the small train. I will go again next trip.
,,I liked it but others may not,3.0,,"I liked it as a novelty zoo, but it wasn't a wow. I enjoyed the tram ride to see the nocturnal animals roaming about a trail. It was dark and difficult to see the animals if you aren't looking in the right direction. Afterwards, one could walk fixed trails and see the animals in their enclosures. It does replicate, to a small degree being out tracking animals in the forest at night... about the best chance if you are not inclined to go in the real bush or a safari. If you are directionally challenged you may get lost a bit so take note of trail signs. Also, if you come by taxi, note where to take one afterwards (across in the parking lot) and keep the number of a taxi service in case you stay till closing and the taxis are gone."
,,Night zoo,5.0,,You feel entirely different to. move among animal's in the dark night. The toy train takes you through time less journey. The fire show at the end is amazing.
,,Nightime Adventure,4.0,,"I went with my hubby & kids. Fantastic sensory overload =)! It was like BEING in a National Geographic (nocturnal) shoot! We saw Hippos, hyenas and a lot more super interesting animals. We watched their animal show at the arena too. The down side was that we went during Happy Deepavali & the lines were excruciatingly long."
,,Not up to mark,3.0,,"we like this even children like a lot ..tram ride with presentation was good.....it like a zoo only the diffrance is that there is no wall or fencing ,,,they make a deep canal instead of fencing ..was thinking to see animal near by but disappointed ,...Live animal show is also waste of time ...."
,,An interesting ride,4.0,,Enjoyed the night safari. The ride through the dark to see the animals is really good. However it seems to have become very popular and we had to wait over an hour to get on a train. It is not very well signposted as initially we followed a group going to a train station only to be told it was a private group and we had to go to another extremely long queue.
,,Interesting way to see the zoo,4.0,,"This was quite a different way to see Singapore zoo, although many of the animals are - obviously - sleeping. A small train takes you through the park, but you can alight to walk around at various stops. I've heard stories that the animals are disturbed by the night visits, which did worry me."
,,Something different,5.0,,"I've been to a number of zoo's but never a night one. It was very interesting to see the different animals you usually would not see like the bats. It is hard to see some animals as it is quite dark in places but most enclosures are lit up so you can see.

The tram ride is good fun too and make sure you do the trails first so that you do not waste time queuing for the tram. We did bot wait to get on the tram, straight on and a row to ourselves (2 people). Others waited to be crammed in at 8 having waited a long time."
,,It's a decent experience for first timers.,4.0,,"Fire show at the entrance gate was awesome, dont miss it. Head to the main tram station to embark on your tram tour. Alight at the East Lodge and head over to the Leopard Trail for the walk-through exhibits. Fishing Cat Trail - end of trail will bring you back near to entrance area. Creatures of the Night Show @ Amphitheatre near entrance (Show Time: 7.30pm, 8.30pm, 9.30pm) Wallaby Trail East Lodge Trail - end of trail should bring you back to the East Lodge Tram Station. Hop onto tram to complete the rest of your tram safari experience"
,,A bit Ho Hum,3.0,,"Not really worth the cost or effort. Mostly animals that you see at the zoo, but in the almost dark. There is a free trundle train trip, but you dont get to see much. If you walk, its very easy to lose your way. Its quite hilly and pushing a wheelchair or kiddies pusher gets to be tiring. Some of the food avable is very much overpriced."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Get there early so that you will not have to wait in line for the tram. We rode the tram, and sometimes it was not possible to see the animals as the tram is moving. If you have time, walk through the park. I think you will be able to see more animals."
,,Wow Experience: Must do walking trails,5.0,,"This is the first time safari experience and it was great to start with a night safari. Suggestions:
1. Reach before 6.45 for the first fire show of the night
2. Get down half way (near the leopard trail / east lodge trail) from Tram ride which starts from 7.15 pm and go for walking trails to get more close to the animals. No worries if you have tram ride for 8.15 / 9.15 slot, you can alter the plan accordingly by completing some walking trails close to entrance before your tram ride. The last tram leaves from entrance at 11.20, so you will have enough time to take the trams and it would get less crowded in the tram after 10 / 10.30 pm
3. Must visit Leopard & East Lodge trails to see Lions, Tigers, Leopards closely
4. Watch out of Lion Feeding session at 8 / 9 pm from the Lion Lookout point. They also have leopard feeding session. Atleast see one of those.
5. Once you complete atleast the 2 walks, take back the tram and complete the other half of journey.
6. You can then go for other two trails which are closer to entrance and then witness the creatures of the night show or vice versa depending on the time / energy.
7. Although its not scary, they have dim lights on the entire walking trails and the guards are also roaming around to ensure safety, prefer to stay where you see some people around to have comfort feeling
7. Vegetarians carry your own food
8. Photographs wont turn out to be good unless you have a high end DSLR / you are an expert photographs as flash is not allowed
9. Pray that is doesn't rain, as the walking trails / shows are cancelled if it rains
10. Cabs are available if at all you leave by 12 am but if you manage to leave a little early, you can save some cash by catching a bus to Ang Mo Kio MRT and then taking the convenient transport from there
11. Need atleast 3-4 hours to thoroughly experience the safari"
,,Excellent Safari for Children,4.0,,"This place is a must visit if you are a family with young children. The ride through the forest in the middle of a sprawling city is unique. The calm of the forest at night is interrupted only by the commentary. We saw many animals, many of which are on the brink of extinction elsewhere. We missed seeing the Malay Tiger, but that was the only sore point of the entire safari. A word of caution: better carry Singapore Dollars and enough of them. All the souvenirs & foodstuffs are overpriced."
,,Loosing its charm - NightSafari,3.0,,"This is my third visit to Night Safari in a span of six years. For a first timer who has never experienced a night safari, this place would impress them but then again there are first timers who would claim this place a blunt Dark Zoo. The Staff are very friendly and helpful. The quality of the show was not as good as it was more than six years ago. I feel this place needs a revamp."
,,Glorious sounds of the forest – singing insects and occasional calls of animals.,4.0,,"I enjoy nature but still value comfort level, like to get off city grid but not up for a rugged adventure. Night Safari is a good fit for me.

Though whizzing through the forest was a relaxing experience, I'd prefer to break up the tram tour instead of taking the full round at one go, it feels long after awhile.

My suggested itinerary:
1. Thumbuakar Performance (6.45pm @ Entrance Plaza)
2. Head to the main tram station to embark on your tram tour.
3. Alight at the East Lodge and head over to the Leopard Trail for the walk-through exhibits.
4. Fishing Cat Trail - end of trail will bring you back near to entrance area.
5. Creatures of the Night Show @ Amphitheatre near entrance (Show Time: 7.30pm, 8.30pm, 9.30pm)
6. Wallaby Trail
7. East Lodge Trail - end of trail should bring you back to the East Lodge Tram Station.
8. Hop onto tram to complete the rest of your tram safari experience. There are many other animals that can only be seen on tram, and vice versa.

This should cover the whole park.

Note: Some parts of walking trails may be too dark for young children, or anyone who is generally afraid of being alone in the dark. The park is very safe, but if you're not comfortable with dimly lit areas you may want to follow closely behind other groups. If not, then go on, be awed by the wonderful and terrifying forest.

Highlight of my evening:
- heard & saw a wolf howled

Least favourite:
Creatures of the Night Show (I think children will enjoy the show... family friendly entertainment)

Overall pleasant experience, I will return again but skip the Creatures of the Night Show.

Have and early meal before going to the park. Be early, park opens at 7.15pm and the last tram ride is 11.30pm. You only have 4 hours."
,,Just ok for one time visit!,3.0,,"It's a decent experience for first timers. I feel they don't have much variety of animals and the animals they have are mostly deers, buffalos and birds. The creatures of night show is very good and is a great experience."
,,Dark zoo,3.0,,It was good when see animal from train but a bit disappointed when walk because hard to see animals in dark. Still good experience:-)
,,Interesting experience,5.0,,"It is an interesing experience to see the animals during the night. The show is also nice. But it is very hard to take photos during night, esspecially during the train ride in the soo..."
,,Best Safari ever seen in my life,5.0,,"It is one of must go places when in Singapore. Night Safari opens at 7pm. Dont miss any shows there, they were awesome shows. It takes 3-4 hours to cover the whole place. Carry your own food especially if you are pure vegeterian..."
,,Try the night safari!,4.0,,You could see the night safari as this is not something you would find anywhere else.. Although I ve seen a better variety of animals in other zoos.. But overall it's a good place to spend an evening if you are in Singapore!
,,Pleasant evening ride through the jungle,4.0,,"We joined the night safari on the first evening schedule. The tour was interesting but when trying to take pictures with out a flash, the results are less than minimal. Suggest a day safari would be more conducive for photography."
,,Night safari,3.0,,We arrived early for the night safari in the naive belief that we would be near the beginning of the queue. However it zoo became clear that pre-booked tours had precedence and we had along wait [ perhaps 45 minutes] to start the safari. It was interesting and we probably saw animals that we would not have seen otherwise. However it only lasted about 25 minutes and I would be reluctant to repeat it. I would certainly not attempt it without a pre-booked ticket.
,,great time with the kids. shocking to see animals so close!,5.0,,we had a a great time visiting the night safari and riding on the tram. you feel like you're right there with the animals!
,,Excellent Animal Preserve,5.0,,"On the Night Safari, animals are minimally back lit so you can see them. They are not caged . The dangerous animals are on an Island, where a large ravine is between you and them but it is located so you don't see it, not right away. Deers and other animals generally have a metal grid on the road between them and the next animals. Yes, they can and do come up to the tram! It is just wonderful !!"
,,A nice addition to the normal zoo experience,4.0,,"We had already been to the zoo and seen almost all of these animals even though they are nocturnal. We may have lucked out on the day we went but, in any event, it is still a nice experience to ride through the zoo on the tram at night. It is not a great opportunity for photos as it is too dark and the tram doesn't really stop so don't waste too much time with your camera. There is a Creatures of the Night show, fire breathers and restaurants and gift shops galore so plan to spend several hours there for the full experience."
,,You can say ..okay,3.0,,"If you have a enough days in singapore then choose it. Staff is very good .One show conductor lady also very smart . But not appealing . You can't get a feel of wow after spending these much . Food out side is very expensive as singapore is very expensive by all means . Tourist place can't be such expensive .
Here there are 2 shows , 1 tram night safari and walking trek (like you visit jungle) has made .
What I don't like is like all animals look tame not like jungle animals . Many places there cabin .has a glass wall so you can see them , which look very unnatural.
The place require 3 to 4 hours to visit .and far from the city ...you can take a bus while returning ( as it is late night )to main bus station and then take a cab is cheaper and better option"
,,An interesting way to see zoo animals up close,4.0,,"I was a little skeptical of this attraction as to me, animals aren't an attraction. They are living, breathing beings that should be allowed to live free and not as our ""pets"". While the Night Safari didn't do much to change that aspect of my thinking, it did make for a much better and more interactive zoo experience for many younger people that otherwise might have found the zoo boring because the animals aren't active at the right time. The park itself is well done, very clean, and appears to have just enough audience participation as well as closeness to the animals. The ability to go for a ride in a tram and see animals very awake and active and extremely close to the tram definitely had an impact on the children seated near us. The flood lights to make sure the animals are visible bothered me, but the emphasis on conservation and recycling were big messages that should resonate with people. All in all it was a good experience, not expensive, put you very close to some 'safe' deer and such as well as able to see lions, tigers and rhinos and other very large predators in a bit of a more natural setting than the traditional zoo setting. We enjoyed ourselves."
,,Not a Bad Way to Spend an Evening,3.0,,"The fire eater show just inside the entrance was entertaining as was the nocturnal animal show in the amphitheater. The tram ride was a little hit and miss and so were the exhibits along the walking trails. Even though a different set of animals are active during the night you're not guaranteed to see them in low light conditions. Nevertheless, it's a good stop, especially with younger kids."
,,Expensive and disappointing,2.0,,We took the opportunity to take the night Safari there were four of us and we all had dinner. The food was at best average and cost $24 for a hamburger french fries and a Coke we boarded the Safari and for the most part the animals were all asleep. The animal show only featured for animals and awful lot of talking about rules and regulations. Suggestion book the 7 o'clock ticket especially if you have young children
,,Adventure in the dark,5.0,,"I enjoyed my visit, although I think that many featured animals aren't necessarily nocturnal. It's a long trip by bus and train, there are some charter bus operators as well."
,,"Watching animals Never gets old, for me atleast",5.0,,"The night Safari still holds lots of entertainment value in animals for me.
I have been there countless numbers of time with friends and family visiting.
I highly recommend watching the live show with all the animals. Very entertaining though slightly cheesy with the script.

there is a good mix of food though you are paying a premium of it.
I would recommend getting the tram definitely and then walking parts of it.
Bat cage and patience is a must, it'll be worth it !"
,,Exciting safari,4.0,,"We have kids ages 9,5 and <1. We went there around 7:30 and on a weekday so we did not have to queue for long. As it is at night, it was exciting for our kids and new to them. Tip: ride the tram to go around the safari and see the animals. It will take about 40 mins to finish all stations then head out to watch the show. Come a bit early as it is on a first come first serve basis. Afternthe show, do the walking trail ( cat fishing and leopard) as those are not part of the tram ride. However, when we went, the leopard was asleep and the fishing cat was just sitting. The animals were up close and it was beautifully landscaped. You feel as if you were truly in their territory. Deers and tapirs were roaming freely. Elephants were majestic!"
,,A unique nocturnal experience,4.0,,"The Night Safari provides a unique opportunity to view nocturnal animals doing their nocturnal thing. The pre-tour show is geared toward children and otherwise skipable, but a tram ride through the zoo provides a different perspective than a normal daytime tour."
,,""" just ok """,1.0,,"I was there with my family and my group members. After universal studio we were so tired still we want to visit the night safari because it's our first trip of Singapore so we never want to miss anything. Bt after we seated in train for night safari I was literally sleeping, it was so dark and all the animals I already seen in zoo accept one or two. So if u have no time than just skip it. Thanks guys."
,,Barely enough time to see all the animals,5.0,,"We went there on a Saturday night. We knew before we visited the night safari that we would be in a hurry to walk all the walking trails, take the train, see the shows and see the feedings in just 3.5 hrs.

But it turns out ok, though we need to walk in a fast pace and make an advance seat reservation (SGD 10 pp) so that we did not need to queue 30 mins before the show started. We got on the train at 10:45 p.m. and enjoyed the ride with very few passengers."
,,Night Safari,2.0,,"The zoo it self might be OK but the night safari is rubbish.

You wait in line for ever to get on a train that goes around the complex in 15 mins. After that you can walk around for hours in the dark looking for animals that you can not see. There are plenty of better attractions in Singapore to spend your time and money on"
,,A wonderful evening trip,5.0,,This was a super way to spend the evening .It was a leisurely ride in tram car seeing all the wonderful wild animals in their habitat.The commentator did a fabulous job.We all thoroughly enjoyed it as it was so well organized .
,,Average Experience,3.0,,"We went for the last ride of the night safari and most animals were already sleeping. The concept is good but it doesnt feel entirely natural, esp due to the spotlights on animals."
,,"Been there, done that, again!",3.0,,"Visited the Night Safari about 5 years ago when it had the Halloween event. Visited 5 years later and I would say there are not much changes but it's gotten crowded! As it was raining on the date of our visit, the tram station was packed! However, the frequency of the trams was fast, hence the queue moved quickly and soon it was our turn. The tram path and the walking path are different, and you will need to take both paths to complete the entire safari."
,,"Must visit, Thrilling Experience",5.0,,Very good and well maintained place. Gives you a different experience overall. Can be very crowded at ticketing counter but a very big place to absorb it. Must not miss Tram ride.
,,pretty cool,3.0,,"In this complex, ZOO, river safari and night safari, I would say that the night safari wasn't my best experience. Ok lots of animals are awake during night time, but this is very packed, and you need to coordinate very well to be able to see all. I'll say it's something to see but don't put it in your TOP 10"
,,Good for first time visitors,4.0,,"Have been here couple of times since starting since 2008.. Till 2014.
I loved the place when I was the first time visitor, of course it becomes quite predictable after that.
Kids don't Hv so much fun as they Hv would Hv in Singapore zoo.
The artists with fancy costumes who walk around to welcome u near the entrance, then there is this fire breathing men performing all dare devil stunts, Hv beautiful ambience as u head inside the main safari premises. And then the queuing up begins which is nonetheless than torture for young kids... At the end of exhaustive day.
The amphitheater show - was brilliant once is now not a charmer. They Hv shortened the show length as well.
Tram rides r ok .. Kids like it but not every time they can really spot what's Been talked about by your guide in the tram over the speakers.
Trails - can be explored if ur kids r good to walk n not scared of darkness n wild sounds.
Overall thumbs up for something new concept .. Safari at night to view nocturnal creatures in their habitat.
But repeat is not interesting.
Tip :- parenting advice ...make sure ur kids r well rested if u r bringing them along."
,,Must visit place to see animals in natural habitat,5.0,,I was mesmerised by the absolute stillness of the night with intermittent growls of the big cats that was interspersed with the sound of crickets. you forget that this is so close to a bustling city.
,,Disappointing and organised chaos,3.0,,"To save 2 journeys, we combined this with the zoo for our visit with grandson. Our last visit was 18 years ago. I think it was better then. I guess there are more visitors now, with which it struggles to cope. After the zoo, we decided to eat at the outlets just outside. Big mistake. The one we preferred had run out of almost everything and we ended up with spaghetti bolognaise (I don't go to the Far East to eat Italian). I wish we had gone a little further and eaten at the courtyard outside the night safari.
We arrived at the night safari with our e-tickets about half a hour before it opened. There was already a long queue which we joined. There did not seem to be anyone we could ask and we relied on the people in front to confirm we were in the right place. Whilst there, we kept seeing people, particularly large groups, arrive by taxi or coach and go ahead of us. The only consolation was that a little while later, those same people had join the back of the queue we were in. We then started to move slowly forward in an orderly manor, but then this rather officious woman told us we had to bunch up and kept shooing us forward. She got a bit annoyed because some people were being polite and not wanting to be seen to queue jump so told others that if they did not want to move to go ahead. At this point we thought 'every man for himself' and just went forward towards the gate. Once in, there was a long queue for the trolley tour. This lasted about 40 minutes but did not include the Tigers as this attraction was closed. By the time the trolley tour came to an end, I could not get out fast enough and we did not bother walking around. It was far too crowded and no fun. We just went to have a drink whilst waiting for our taxi to arrive. Quite honestly, this was not value for money and would not bother visiting again. On the other hand, I would visit the zoo tomorrow if I could."
,,Different experience,5.0,,"Night Safari was a completely different experience for all of us. Live show was good and informative but best part was Safari. Inspite of long queue (30-40 minutes in weekdays), entire experience was quite unique. Must visit attraction for young kids and adventure lover."
,,A Unique Experience ....,4.0,,"The best part of it is that it is one of its kind in Asia (not sure?). The excitement of moving around in the forest in the night is quite exciting. As the time of opening is fixed (7 PM), the crowd at the gate is somewhat annoying. Then there is further long Q for getting into a bus. The bus ride takes appr. 45 minutes. It passes through a lot of animal staying area (there are no cages). The watching of various animals in the night is a unique experience. King Lion was a sight to watch & behold! Most enthusiastic can move around on foot also. There is a station also where you can get down and see animals closely.. After the bus ride, you can enjoy a fire dance also. Then there are a no. of shops selling soft toys and other items …"
,,Too dark!,1.0,,"Too dark, can't see the animal, even read the information, and walk the pathway. Introduction in tram also not interesting, not clear."
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,"This is a must for any tourist - it's spectacular. You can walk around but it's worth going on the free ride but unfortunately you have to wait a while in a line, that's the only negative. Our highlight was seeing the wolves howl - amazing!"
,,Great interesting,5.0,,Very different way to experience the wild life our guide Linda from tour east was amazing! We were able to do it all as without tour you spend most of the time waiting on lines. Only complaint food wasn't that good
,,Love it!,5.0,,"One of the best attractions in Singapore. This is the second time we have visited this attraction, the first time was in 1999. It has not changed much in that time and still presents a unique charm and a novel way of understanding wildlife. There are aspects which some may find difficult to cope with such as the leopards from Sri Lanka, presented as a political gift to Singapore and the entertaining nightlife show but others might see the value in education and the uniqueness of the project.
There are plenty of food outlets here and great little shops. There is a strict ticket system so ensure you book in good time and try and leave plenty of time to access the trails before or after the train ride. There is plenty to see in the trails so don't miss anything out.
Be prepared to dispense with your camera. Flash photography is strictly prohibited. Leave extra time to get here by public transport as it takes longer than you expect. Going by taxi can take longer too as inevitably the evening rush hour traffic can slow progress down."
,,Skip-the-Line: Priority Tram Boarding at Night Safari with Buffet Dinner by Tour East,4.0,,"I bought this activity through Viator. I was picked up on time at my hotel. It was a well-organized visit to the Night Safari. We all had the buffet dinner before boarding the tram. The buffet dinner was good with quite a selection.

The priority tram boarding was definitely an advantage since there was quite a long line-up. After the tram ride, you have the optional of exploring the walking trails or catching the “Creature of the Night” show. There is also an entertaining fire-eating show.

You do see quite a number of creatures during the tram ride. Flash photography is not allowed. The “Creature of the Night” show was also funny and entertaining. We were dropped off at our hotel at the end of the visit to the Night Safari."
,,A very different experience than usual,4.0,,"i was confused when i read about night safari in Singapore, what would it be like etc.
It turned out to be a pretty good experience. you pass by a lot of animals in open and mangroves cage was amazing. I really can't explain. you must visit this place. Its worth it."
,,A bit disappointing but worth it with young children,3.0,,"Having visited a few years ago I was a bit disappointed to find that it had been Disney'd. In addition the animals were difficult to spot and most were cows, pigs, goats and cattle. There were not enough interesting animals now. However the Indian Elephants saved the night especially the father if the herd! Go early and see all of the side shows. The food is average to good and privy."
,,Not to be missed experience,5.0,,Trams take you on a 40 minute drive through the jungle. Animals can be seen at each turn. Exceptionally well organised with very comprehensive commentary along the way. Take time to walk some of the trails after your tram ride.
,,This place was great!,4.0,,"The free show is entertaining, interactive and not too long. The tram is the way to go as this place is huge. It provides a drop off/ pick up option which lets you get up and personal with some species. The areas for animals are open air so it feels like a real habitat. Some animals are within a couple of metres away as you drive by. Awesome thing to do for a date or ESP for families. A bit out of the way from the city but we took a cab from orchard rd and it cost about $30 Canadain."
,,Night zoo,3.0,,"we did the zoo at night, sorry for us there was not a wow factor here. The trolley car that took us around the intercom system was faulty and thus wasn't fixed until 2/3 of the way around. It was quite difficult to find your way around, and staff whereat particularly helpful"
,,Well Kept Zoo,4.0,,"I went along with the dozen member group of mine to the famous Singapore Zoo and we chose to visit in the evening. It was a conscious decision as we wanted to see the zoo in its original night avatar. And I must say it did send a shiver down the spine.

We toured all around the zoo and spent quiet some time on the tram car as well which took us all over the zoo. Overall a fruitful visit"
,,Yeah not so great for the nocturnal animals,1.0,,"While great to see some unusual animals, particularly from the region, and the idea and conservation message are admirable, I was increasingly frustrated with the way the animals were treated. There were a few signs around indicating 'no flash cameras' but at nearly every window there was one or more idiot flashing away with cameras or phones, regardless of the glass (surely reflected back) or the size of the enclosure (ie flash worthless) or using torches so they could get a better look at the nocturnal animals. While there were a lot of the (usual) bored looking staff around their job was to ensure people didnt get run over where you cross the path taken by the buses (which we didnt take due to 1.5 hour wait). The animals looked miserable. I dont know if there is a technical solution but more could and should be done to look after the animals and educate the visitors before they enter. I would recommend against going to this attraction until they lift their game (no pun intended)."
,,A unique animal excusrsion,4.0,,"This is a very interesting and visually impressive animal excursion. We went with an organised trip, and had VIP 'beat the queue' tickets for the tram ride. I am really glad about that, because it was busy when we were there. I am really glad we did this activity; it was certainly worth the price of the admission."
,,Better than the zoo,5.0,,"You start your adventure in the Night Safari with a train ride around the attraction. Don't miss this part out as you get to see some animals not accessible on foot. In many cases the train takes you into the animals enclosures so you really get close to them even if it is only for a short while. Once you've done the train then you can get a map and strike out along the walking paths. These are well lit and well signposted and closely supervised by the staff. Most of the animals are more active at night so you see them running around or feeding rather than lying under a bush. It is a completely different experience and quite exciting. There are lots of animals to see on the walking trails and a small bit of information about them. We liked the hyenas who spent their time watching for and alert to the arrival of the train or foot walkers. They were actually stalking the walkers, not that they could get to them.
You can but food of the fast food variety there but it's better to eat first so you can spend all your time enjoying the animals.
We got there just before the gates opened and there was a huge crowd waiting. They all got in fairly quickly and were efficiently loaded on to the trains so we didn't have a long time to wait. Bring bug spray as there were mossies around.
It's a whole different experience to the zoo and we enjoyed it a lot more. The joint zoo + night safari ticket is cheaper than buying two separate tickets. You don't have to go to both on the same day and it's probably too tiring to try to do so.
The SAEx bus also does the night safari ride from the city centre for $5 each way. It is a cheap and comfortable way to get there. Ask your hotel where the nearest stop is for you. You don't need to book, just turn up at the bus stop."
,,What happened here???,2.0,,"I still have fond memories of my first overseas vacation to Singapore back in 2001 & Night Safari is the one that still stands out...2015 was my 3rd time there & was so disappointed to see it go so downhill in the last 14 years - probably a case of being too good for its own good

dont get me wrong its still an excellent concept in an amazing setting, however they are managing it quite poorly with the crowds

i took a bad call to go on a Saturday & was there at 7 am...was totally disappointed that we had to wait 2 hours for the tram ride on a hot & humid night...if i had read the reviews before, i would have skipped this totally

on the tram ride as well, it was disappointing to see that they dont have as many animals as in the past ...good that we saw some lions & elephants but the rest seemed to be a profusion of deers of all shapes...was so late by the time we finished that we couldnt walk around any more

the 2 shows - creatures of night & fire fighters were good...if you had to pick though i'd say go with fire fighters, they were more spontaneous & easy to catch on the way out/in. creatures of night also seems to have lost so many animals over the years though the host did conduct it well there just werent enough animals

they should probably restrict or batch the number of tourists per day...i'd say try your luck on a weeknight & never go on the weekend, maybe you'd be luckier..the price does seem ridiculous though

Tip: To get to the zoos, i'd suggest using the shuttle service called SAeX which drops you off & brings you back for just sgd 10/person"
,,"Nice ride, but needs more flare...",3.0,,"It was a decent ride in the night safari. Not a lot of nocturnal animals which would have been nice. Dont take the walk, if you are not up for it. Overall an average trip."
,,Late Night,4.0,,"I was with my family come to this place for the 1st time to see the Safari Zoo in Singapore.. but i was really shocked bcoz they have NIGHT SAFARI that make me think twice even more.. How can i go to see the animal during dark and late night ? But overall, once i did to see the animal in the mid night is more fun thoug.. lol"
,,Unique,4.0,,"Had heard a lot about this & was not dissapointed...in fact I loved it...the whole idea.

We had bought tickets beforehand, so skipped that.

Before the ride, there was a fantastic fire show. A long queque for the ride...cant be helped. Didnt see too many animals but the way the ride was conducted...the background noises of the animals...it was different.

A must do once."
,,Darkness was all we saw,1.0,,"We bought our tickets at the airport but the tickets still need to be converted to the zoo's ticket, there are only 2 counters severing while there were hundreds of us queuing. There 4 others counter serving tour groups, we only learnt after 1hr of waiting at the same spot, that we will have to wait for at least 2 more hr before we could get through the entrance and on the train ride because there were many tour groups. So our family with a baby and 6 years old decided to go home :(

We came back on the next day, the wait was only 45 mins. The train ride was pitch black! So disappointed. Waste of money and time!
I do not recommend this place to anyone!"
,,A unique experience,4.0,,"I was quite skeptical about spending money behind this, I was told by many that the animals are not visible in the night etc, sorry, but we managed to spot almost all the animals in their enclosures. The scary part is that there is almost no boundary and whilst you are safely separated by a water boundary which many times in the night is not visible and you feel what if the animal decided to charge you!

The tram ride is quite comfortable with good commentary and the animals are visible as I think they put food for the animals right under the mild lights they have so they can be seen eating. Tapir's are let loose on the road and you can actually get a close up experience whilst on the tram, they come real close to the tram! We loved that feeling of unknown fear, ofcourse it was all safe but you know how you feel right?

We also did the walking trails and actually found that more enjoyable although tiring that after a whole day at the zoo. The bat cove is superb and scary to see fruit bats hanging at arms distance from you and walking through it gives you that creepy scary feeling. Ofcourse if you are the panicky one skip it!

The Animals of the night show was also pretty cool and we pretty much loved it! :)

I'd recommend anyone that wants to see how the jungle feels in the night!"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"I enjoyed the Night Safari in Singapore but I find that opening hours are just too short. The crowd is big and the line up to enter can take 30 mins to n hour as there is always a rush of people to get in early, to see as much as possible, obviously.

The tram service is very too and although I feel that there should have been more stops.

What I find disappointing is that people start rushing to leave the zoo about 45 mins before closing time, so just like the line up to enter, there is a huge line up to leave.

I find the experienced rather rushed. I don't see the need to rush as it is after all a night zoo. It should be open longer through the night."
,,It was ok,4.0,,"We went there more for our son. He enjoyed seeing the animals and all but given it is a night safari, when on the tram, you really have to look to see the animals. The show was underwhelming in our opinion as we expected to see more animals but the host of the show was great, entertaining, and engaging but then again we were there to see the animals. It was an experience though but probably that was the 1st and last for us."
,,Superb Trip with Up Close Animals,5.0,,"We took the night safari trip on the recommendation of our hotel concierge and we were not disappointed. We booked a trip where we were collected and returned to our hotel, although we could have made our own arrangements.
The trip is in electric tram cars and starts from near to the zoo entrance. Our trip was scheduled to begin at 19.15, and people started to queue at 18.15. There was a fire-eating display to the left of queueing public which started at 18.45, so this filled some of the time before the gates opened to access the tram cars. Commentary was made throughout the trip and it was stressed that no flash photography was allowed, which meant no photos unless you had a very sophisticated camera as it was dark on the trip. Each location was lit to show off the tremendous variety of animals throughout the park. The trip took approximately 40 minutes, and there was the opportunity to disembark and walk through 4 separate walking trails. After the conclusion of the ride, we queued a short time to see an outdoor display in the amphitheatre which lasted a further 30 minutes. Overall a great evening spent in warm temperatures."
,,A new experience,4.0,,"Very well put together - the animals are inevitably pretty lazy at night but it makes for an interesting view. The spookiness, the quiet, the wide eyes, it all led to great experience. I enjoyed the fire dance at the beginning. Definitely worth doing once - perhaps not more though. The crocs were very close, great to see something and actually be a bit worried it could get you."
,,One of the best Night Safari in the world,4.0,,Singapore Night Safari is definitely one of the best in the world. You get closed to nature and animals.
,,Not that worth...,3.0,,"We waited so long for our turn to ride a vehicle only to see numerous kind of deers... And a tiger. Rest all the animals were not their and also it was too dark to see anything.
The shows after the safari were basically for kids. So we didn't enjoyed that much."
,,Night Safari experience,5.0,,"This was one of the best experience that I could fetch during my visit to the Singapore. Would suggest people to purchase tickets right from the airport counters by the name of ""Changi Recommends"" as this helps in saving time in standing in Queues later."
,,Night safari with limited wild animals,3.0,,I happened to see Night safari 15 years back and got impressed. But again i visited this month and disappointed with the number of wild animals in the night safari. Most of the them are deers and many other animals missing...
,,Too dark and hard to see very clearly,4.0,,"Night Safari is very original and it is one of the most famous attraction in Singapore. I have been there three times and I gradually found it was a bit boring. If you want to see animals , Singapore zoo is not an alternative for this one"
,,"Not recommended, it is better to have trail walk in Zoo",2.0,,"Pre-booked (essential) and arrived at 6.45 for a 7.30 opening time. Joined an apparently endless queue running down past the car park for several hundred feet and were fearing for the worst. However, the gates opened early at 7pm and the queue moved fast. Finally boarded the tram with two young kids at 7:45 PM thinking of exciting trip.
But in totally 1/2 hour trip, hardly any animals are clearly visible. All the time they will keep announcing "" No Flash photography"", so no photos also.
It is better to take zoo ticket for trail walk in the day time for which tickets are cheaper and then watch a few evening shows that happen there , have dinner and come home happily.
Don't waste money for night safari which will end up without any animals clearly visible.
Taxi from the centre of town took 30 mins and cost $23) - very easy way to get there and back."
,,A waste of £21!,1.0,,"A 40 minute drive on a safari vehicle driven at a snails pace on a road through the zoo. We saw 4 elephants, 2 lions, 2 hippos, 2 rhinos, 1giraffe some buffalo and countless types of deer. The tiger had gone elsewhere that evening!
The show afterwards was to say the least amateurish. More panto than Animals of the Night.
Sadly much needs to be done to make this trip value for money."
,,An excellent way to spend an evening.,4.0,,"Dubbed by some as ""one of the best attractions in Singapore"" its hard to disagree, even if you're not a nature buff.

The animals were really up close ad personal, the trails not overtly long and the attendants littered along the trail were extremely helpful.

Things to bring:
- Wear dri-fit clothes or cooling clothes if possible, as expected in a ""forest"" the atmosphere is relatively warm and humid.
- Shoes or Sneakers that are comfortable to walk in.
- Water bottles, there are water coolers dotted around the trail but you WILL be thirsty.
- Some snacks as the restaurants/food stands there are really expensive and you might want something to munch on.
- If you want to take photos, unless you have a good night camera WITHOUT flash, your phone camera will be sufficient. (REMEMBER TO SWITCH OFF FLASH)
- If you're going for it, remember to reach promptly, latest 8pm (opens 7pm/7.30pm) as the park is pretty huge and completing the trail took me from 8pm to about 10:30pm, with the park closing @ 12am.
- Walk first, take the tram after completing the trail as the queue will be next to nothing at that point.

All in all, bring your S/O or your family and be enthralled by the animals in their natural sleep cycle and habitat."
,,Zoo at night,3.0,,Its like a zoo which you are allowed to visit at Night. Dont expect any safari into the jungles or something. There is one animal show which is pretty good.
,,Unique and best destination in Singapore,5.0,,This is probably the unique and best destination in Singapore. Don't miss out on the live shows which are awesome too.
,,Nice experience!,4.0,,"One of Singapore's most well known attractions, it was actually a really nice experience. The tram ride itself was very relaxing and the whole 'moon night experience' was created nicely.

Located opposite Singapore Zoo & River Safari.

Animals can be seen from close range although smaller animals like otters can be hard to spot (the walking trails which I missed would be better for smaller animals). We even spotted mating Malayan Tapirs which was totally unexpected!

Be warned though as queues can be really long and you can expect to wait 30-45 mins if you reach late. The rides start exactly at 7:30 pm.

Lot of options to eat and shop.

Nearest MRT is Choa Chu Kang from where you can take bus no 927 to the zoo which takes around 15 mins."
,,waste of time,1.0,,"If you are thinking of seeing something spectacular, you can forget it. The show in the amphitheater is a poor copy of shows at Disneyland. The ride thru the zoo was a waste of time. You can barely see the animals. Save your money, and go to the zoo in the daytime."
,,Once in a life time experience,5.0,,one of the best trips I have ever taken whilst on holiday. it sticks in my mind as a magical once in a life time experience. you get to go round on safari trucks and see the animals by night. under the stars and moon this is a really stand out experience and the kids seem to love this!
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"Great place to go, the show before that takes place at regular intervals is a must watch. It is really worth the time and money. Try to get there early as you will be disappointed it you reach late. You can experience the animals passing by you and superb staff as well."
,,Animal advocate approved,5.0,,"I am hesitant to visit animal attractions due to my views on animal rights etc. I made an exception after hearing how well a job they have done and how much they focus on conversation. I was not disappointed. The night tram was awesome, animals within a few feet uncaged. The staff seemed to really love their jobs. I wish that atmosphere could be duplicated around the world."
,,Need to walk a lot,4.0,,"The night safari is a different experience - seeing the animals in dark. There is tram service available - but if you wish to see all the animals closely, you need to walk a lot."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"The Night Safari was amazing! We were so close to the animals and there were no cages to block the view. While the line times were considerably long, they were worth it!"
,,Nothing much to see in night,3.0,,Better to visit Zoo instead of Night Safari. There was a show with animals but not worth for what you are paying for it.
,,Night time Fun,5.0,,This was an interesting visit. We had done the day Zoo so decided to try the nightitme one. We were not disappointed and loved the trolley journey and displays. Any family of all ages would enjoy this.
,,It is a something you should do,4.0,,"This a very good attraction, though I thought rare short on time frame, being a night safari it is hard to see some animals. overall good"
,,A Disney style experience,3.0,,"First time back to the night safari in about 15 years. Park has come of age and is fully equipped with the food halls, long ques and pricy merchandise of a Disney land experience. We booked a 8:15pm tour but you can get in about 7:30pm. There was a fire show at 8pm and the night adventure started at 8:30pm. The tram tour runs constantly, just join a long que and jump on board. We have young children, so the late start was not ideal and the whole experience different from the last time I was there. Still worth a look. Make sure your children have had plenty sleep before you go.thefood hall"
,,Good if coupled with a visit to the ZOO,4.0,,"I decided to merge the night Safari with the visit to the Zoo. Safari starts at 7 pm, but gates are open, so you can get in earlier. There are places to eat, plus areas to buy drinks and ice cream. I pre-booked my tickets, as per advice provided by other trip advisor reviewers, however, having asked where to enter I was shown a place where people started queuing from 6 pm. As I wanted to get back to central Singapore before 10 pm, it was important for me to get on the first available tram, which meant queuing with others at that point. It was tiring but paid off. By 7 pm there were lots of people. At 6.45pm there was a 15-minute show however everyone who was not in the queue stood right in front of us and we could not see it very well. Safari itself lasted about 45 minutes and was a good experience. Animals were visible and commentary was good. I think that if I did this as a standalone visit I would have liked it less. It could be organised a little better in terms of access for those who pre-booked."
,,Better than first impressions...,5.0,,"Pre-booked (essential) and arrived at 6.45 for a 7.30 opening time.

Joined an apparently endless queue running down past the car park for several hundred metres and were fearing for the worst.

However, the gates opened early at 7pm and the queue moved fast.

Everyone in front of us headed straight for the tram tour so we decided to go against the flow and headed off into the dark on the Wallaby walking trail (completely on our own for the first 15 minutes).

We ended up spending a fascinating 2.5 hours wandering the trails and by 9.45 or so were back at the start having seen almost all the animals.

By then we decided that we had seen far more that we would see from the tram (which we occasionally came across on our walk - noisy guests and recorded commentary) and opted to head home.

The trails were great - often we were alone with the animals. Walking around a corner and coming face to face with a pack of hyenas, watching the slow loris climbing around on branches just next to us, the otters playing, the fishing cats actually chasing fish in their ponds, coming face to face with a pangolin, the lions feeding and fighting, flying foxes feeding 1m away from us - so many unique close up experiences.

On the day we visited, the attraction closed at midnight. As we headed home around 10pm the tram was deserted and almost all remaining guests were in the 'show' (which once again we avoided). If you are not jet lagged then may well be worth visiting later in the evening.

Overall - a unique experience. Could have been crowded and unpleasant but by bucking the trend and moving away from the crowds we had a fantastic time.

(Taxi from the centre of town took 30 mins and cost $23) - very easy way to get there and back."
,,Bitten to death,3.0,,The welcome ceremony is brilliant and exciting but we weren't fully prepared for what to expect. There a lot of walking and obviously the lighting is kept to a bare minimum so be prepared for a few trip ups.We had smothered ourselves with insect repellent but it made no difference as we were bitten just about everywhere.The animals didn't make an impact unfortunately.
,,One time affair,3.0,,"Well managed & organised, but not extra ordinary.. It's just good for kids .. You will not miss anything if you don't visit the night safari on your trip to Singapore.."
,,Great view of night animals,4.0,,The evening at night safari was an enjoyable fare. A closer look at the animals is offered here. It is more exciting for kids.
,,Too much hype !!!,3.0,,"Singapore tourism is giving too much hype of this activity and in the end it's nothing. After a long wait in queue, They will take you on a ride in open electric car and will offer only 5-10 minutes of safari and will drop you back.

You will get far better view of these animals in any other zoo.

This is completely wastage of money and time. If you are on short trip, Please avoid this activity and spend more time in Sentosa Island and explore all the activities over there."
,,Must must must,5.0,,This Safari I would recommend to do a must. This is something unique to Singapore. I would recomend the show and then tra ride. If you have corage after that go for a trail walk after that.
,,Great experiance,5.0,,"Was recommend this by a friend and glad we went. Excellent experiance seeing the animals at night. The safari was well done and you have the option to get off the safari halfway round and walk around a number of enclosures. The leopard one was particularly good.
There is a show at the end that I would recommend too which was very good fun"
,,So long queue and wait wait,3.0,,I supposed to see something special at night zoo but turn out that i have to waited 2 hours to access the queue and get in just to see the animals are sleeping! Nothing that excited but it is good place for dating couple...
,,Best zoo in the world,5.0,,"Exceptional, that says it all. We had a fantastic day from start to finish. Get your tickets on line it's quick, easy, 10% cheaper and you will skip queues. Got a combo ticket 3 in 1 (Zoo+ River Safari + Night Safari).

We were there on opening time and left at closing time it was fantastic. The zoo is very clean and very big. It has amazing family shows, but the Night Safari it's the best."
,,A great evening,5.0,,"Living in Singapore, this is the one activity that i suggest to all of my visitors. It's a great evening for people of any age. Don't miss the fire show. When I came with my disabled mom I was really appreciative of the free wheel chairs and the priority lines. It's really disabled friendly. Staff were super helpful."
,,A different experience!,4.0,,"We had a different experience when we went for night safari. It was unlike Singapore experience. There was a long queue. waiting time was high. Some people even jumped the queue. When we got our chance, it was quite late and the animals were perhaps ready for going to sleep. But, in spite of all these, it was a memorable trip as the queue moved continuously. Some shows were also going on en-route."
,,Walk it if you can,4.0,,We took the Night Safari tour on a type of pull along train. It was a popular attraction and very busy. We received a discount for travelling Singapore airlines. We seemed to zip from one themed area to the next catching glimpses of some fabulous animals as we went. They were glimpses. We saw people walking doing their own night tour and I think we might have been able to pause and take in more doing that as the trip is over quickly. The zoo is a long way from the centre of the city where we were staying and so was a bigger night than we anticipated by the time we finally caught a cab there. We didn't look at any of the other displays of night birds etc but they were seemingly popular.
,,"too many people, too many queues",2.0,,"2nd visit. Enjoyed it 5 years ago when we organised the visit ourselves. This time booked through tour where I felt we were herded like the animals.
Big queue to get in. After queuing for for half an hour has to rush to see show. I remember this used to be much better. See very few animals, maybe 5, and seem to be more interested in taking the fun out of someone in the crowd.
After this the real fun starts, waiting in queue for an hour to get on the tram. Ridiculous, spoils the night but maybe that's just me.
The actual tram ride and looking at the animals is good, and you get to sit down. Lots of deers though, seemed a bit like a deer park to me.
Left straight after. Just too many people. Need to limit the numbers or stager the times for entry."
,,So glad we went,5.0,,"some friends told us about this. well worth the visit, as we got to see many animals from a different perspective. getting there just after 7pm when they opened, make sure you wait by the entrance for the fire dancers. then make your way inside where all the animals have just been fed, and so are up close and easier to espy. then off to walk a trail or hop on the 'train' which takes you through the grounds. the 'show' at the end is worthwhile too. lots of yummy places to grab a bite to eat, or a souvenir from. would definitely do it again and walk a few different trails. We were with a tour group which gave us priority access to the train. we went on a weeknight, but on a busy night this would be helpful."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"The entire safari was in an open buggy passing through the main road of the park. You could see most animals by the roadside, including lions, hyenas, etc. under spotlights. It was as if all the animals were placed there, which didn't seem natural."
,,Interesting Night Safari,4.0,,This is a trip for both the young and old. Everyone would enjoy themselves on this night safari. The tram ride was fun and informative.
,,Do not go on the Night Safari on a Friday Night!!,3.0,,We lined up for 2 hours to get onto the Night Safari train on a stinking hot night in Singapore. I would never do it again and felt really sorry for the young children who also lined up for that long. The Safari was good but not good enough to spend that much money and that amount of time being uncomfortable and so very hot. Not sure if it is any better on any other night.
,,A truly immersive experience,5.0,,"A great experience, that's almost real in the way it's been created. Watch different environments and flora and fauna pass you by as you go along in a slow train with a guide explaining the different species, or get down and walk for parts of the trip. It's not only great and educational for kids, but also fun for adults"
,,Everyone Must visit,5.0,,"It was an awesome experience. I went with my friends we have enjoyed night safari There were many wild animals elephants, Tigers, Lions, wolves, leopard. Also there were different types of snakes inclusing Anaconda."
,,Here you can wild animals out of cage one can sayThis is a world Almost all people from the world visit this pclass zoo,5.0,,Long cues are always their to see. This is a part of santosa It opens at about 8 pm A children train is the only way to go .Automatic flood lights also move along with animals movement.But do not put flash lights on animals otherwise they are aggressive
,,awesome place....live the life in jungle..,5.0,,"This was the most awaited attraction to visit as most of my friends who had visited Singapore recommended it. Its just a couple of minutes walk from Zoo. So, ideally visit the zoo in afternoon and then get in the queue for the night adventure. To avoid queue, make sure you complete the zoo by max 6pm. It was a 30 mins waiting for us before we could enter the premises and then there was a long line for tram ride. We reached inside around 7.25 and “Creatures of the Night” show was about to begin. My wife and I skipped the idea of going for tram tour and went straight for the show. The show was one of a kind and very entertaining. The organizers made sure that you get totally involved in it. It was for a duration of 20 minutes. This show happen multiple times, so please plan accordingly and don’t miss ir. After that we again went for tram tour and after waiting in queue for almost 40 minutes, we got our ride which was totally worth. Its about 30-40 minutes guided ride where we got in close with many wild creatures especially we saw the king of jungle in the moonlit view. Then there were elephants, deers, wolves, leopard, etc. Camera with flashes are not allowed, so please keep all your cellphones and cameras in bag and enjoy the beauty of jungle in the dark. You would definitely cherish the complete 30 mins of ride whole of your life. We were tired and hence did not go for walking trails. It was overall an awesome experience and would recommend it to everyone."
,,night safari is a must,4.0,,"We really enjoyed a family visit in the evening. The night safari and show were really good fun and a bit different to our standard zoo trips, with a lot less walking!"
,,Night safari - something different,4.0,,"Very clean & well organized place. Night safari nice experience and something different to regular zoo's. Taxi ride about 30 mins from downtown, and very good availability of taxis also for departing back to hotel in evening. Good services with food available on entrance. Unfortunately tigers where not possibly to see at this time but plenty of other animals in their natural environment."
,,Night view of the Singapore zoo,4.0,,This is a must visit sightseeing spot for those who are visiting Singapore with their Kids ! An opportunity to see animals in night is providing only at this place in Singapore
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Night tour is separate from the River Safari and the Singapore Zoo however is at the same tourist location. Entry to each of the three attractions is separate. We took the river safari and then went on to the Night Safari which opened at around 6.30pm. The Night Safari itself commenced at around 7.00pm where you can take a trolley ride around the park witnessing amazing wildlife or if you want you can walk the park. Travelling with pre teen children so the trolley ride was the best option. Great perspective of the animals at night. After trolley ride, proceeded to the animal show which was fun for the kids but not overly long. Travel to and from the attractions can be made on public transport, hop on/hop off tour companies or organised tours,"
,,Go later and avoid queues,4.0,,"We came by taxi just after 8.30 on a Friday night and the were no queues to get in. Purchased tickets online and printed them at hotel for 10% discount.

There was a small queue at the tram but we hit the walking trails first and did the tram at the end. no queue at all by the time we got to the tram @ approx 10:30.

Take water and good walking shoes and you will enjoy. It is still hot and sweaty work walking around … but worthwhile."
,,A very nice zoo!,5.0,,A very nice zoo. The night safari & bird show is interesting. Somehow it's a bit hard to catch a public bus to your hotel after the night safari. Good public facility & clean.
,,Well done,4.0,,Read you brochures properly I spent 20 mins running through a very muggy eve only to find out the tiger feeding was not every particular day of the week thought. FIne print was there it was my mistake. Show was great. Very packed... everything about its packed people wise. Felt sorry for our guide who had to tell a specific individual to turn their flash off at least a dozen times. e ruined it a bit for the rest of us. Still if you're at the zoo you may as well do the safari too. Night was very different to day.
,,"Unique, meh",3.0,,"It's basically a trip to the zoo at night.

If you think it's difficult to see animals in the zoo by day, imagine what it could be like at night. However, you get to see many animals (in the semi-dark) because there's lighting, and at some places, the animals are gathered around a feeding area.

The tram ride queue is long, and as previously noted, moves very quickly. The narration was very good, and you get to see many animals. The ""Creatures of the Night"" show is short and boring, but kids would like it. My favorite part was walking around the trails in the dark. Singapore cools down a bit after dark and it makes for a pleasant walk.

They open the doors a little early, and that's very nice (opening time is 7:30). The Zoo area is a pain to get to by public transit. There were plenty of cabs waiting to take people home when I left.

It's an unique experience for sure, but I wouldn't consider it a ""must-do""."
,,Night safari,5.0,,"The night safari is a great, fun night out with the kids. A very different experience to any other zoo we have visited. Try to get there early as it can get very busy."
,,Good activities at night,4.0,,"Suggest to go on the tram trip earlier, then continue the show and walking trail. The queue before open really long and have to wait in queue around more than half an hour after purchased ticket (excluded the time waiting the entrance to open for ticket purchasing). I hope there is more tram provided in every single trip to reduce the queue. Thanks for enhancing the point of caring the animals such as reminding visitors to close the flash, they did their best to reduce and protect the animals."
,,Exciting and different,5.0,,to experience creatures of the night was exciting. The only frustration was not being able to take pictures.
,,zoo at night,3.0,,"Potential to be something really good and is promoted as a great experience. In reality a bit dull, maybe I'm a bit of a cynic but I visited the zoo at night, nothing more. If you are in Singapore for a very short stay say less than a week , don't go out of your way for this unless you are an animal/zoo fanatic."
,,Do It!,5.0,,"The best experience in Singapore. Lines were a little long to get in the park, and it was a bit confusing trying to get to the shows, but the safari itself was amazing. My husband, and I had fun scaring ourselves. It was a bit like Jurassic Park!"
,,"Must-See attraction, unique experience!",5.0,,"The Night Safari is adjacent to Singapore Zoo, though I must confess, it is a very different experience to see the animals at night. The animals are nocturnal, so they remain active during the visiting hours. The views are really close and worth your while. We felt the animals were really close and could jump onto our tram, of course, this does not happen. We were tired after visiting the Zoo, but eventually glad that we did not miss the night Safari. There are tram rides for our convenience, one may also enjoy walking trails.
The Fire show is really spectacular and worth watching. We did not like much the animal show."
,,Feels like you could almost touch the animals,4.0,,"Followed that recommendation from friends to visit the Night Safari at the Zoo and weren’t disappointed. Don’t be put off by the queue when you arrive, they move people through really quickly. If you haven’t already bought tickets online, send a runner ahead to buy tickets while someone queues. You could also arrive later to avoid the queues. It’s well worth the wait to see the animals up close, you feel like you could almost reach out and touch them, they are that close. Some dining options in the zoo but might not suit all tastes. Make sure you stay for the fire dancing at the end, it was awesome!!"
,,Excellent can really get photos but who needs them,4.0,,Loved it. We booked through our hotel which was well worth it. Bus to and from hotel and also got to skip the massive queues. Cost a little bit extra but no need to arrange your transport there and back. Great to see the animals up close and finish your day with the fantastic gelato. No point taking a amera as it's that dark it's nearly impossible to get a shot of the aminals as you can't use a flash.
,,Unique in so many ways,5.0,,"I have visited so many great zoos and after awhile, they all seem the same. The night safari here adds a whole new element and is a mandatory stop for anyone visiting Singapore!"
,,Could have been more exciting,3.0,,"Waited long in the queue just to enter. Tram ride at night in the middle of the zoo was exciting, many animals but there could be more organized, believe its over-rated!"
,,Night safari: a mixed experience,4.0,,"This is understandably amongst the must-see attractions in Singapore.

First, some logistics: ticketing and transport: buying packages online can be convenient, but some operators place a significant premium on the base cost. If you buy a ticket watch the time of the ticket: 7:15 pm, 8:15 pm, 9:15 pm refers to the entry time to the Safari - timed admission for crowd control. The later the admission, the less time. Note that you may be admitted early if attendance permits - it is worth asking. The Safari's website showed the 7:15 pm show as being sold out, but the bus operator was selling these tickets aboard the bus (obviously some sort of block booking). We used SaEx to get to the Safari - cheap and efficient - it is a long ride by taxi or public transport - especially when returning after 11 pm. The last 'express' buses appear to leave around 11 pm.

If you are waiting for entry, then you can be amused by a 5-minute duration fire-twirling show (about every 30 minutes...), and casual drinking/dining choices and souvenir shops.

Once you enter the Safari, the wait is most definitely worth it. I would suggest mixing the tram ride and walking trails if you have time, as some exhibits can only be seen on one or the other. Plan your visit using the map according to available time and walking ability.. There are many helpful (human) guides. There was constant helicopter noise from the nearby military base, but it doesn't perturb the animals. Some of the animal were not visible (don't blame them) or exhibits closed - but the leopards, Asian and white lions, slow loris, gaur, rhinos, hunting cats, elephants, and many other animals made the experience memorable.

Photography is difficult - there is obviously a no-flash policy, and there was often scratched / reflective material between animal and visitor. More subtle backlighting of some of the explanatory signs would help preserve night vision and improve readability of text.

There were not many insects despite the nature of the environment and close proximity to water - however, insect repellant, drinking water, and umbrellas would be a good idea. Wear shoes with good grip - wet leaves on the trails can be a hazard.

The show in the ampitheatre is cute, performed by amusing hosts and even more amusing small animals (otters, pythons etc), but is of only 20 minutes duration. If faced with a choice between the show and seeing more animals - would go for the animals.

A most memorable experience."
,,Don't ever go on a public holiday!,4.0,,"Kids LOVE to stay up past their bedtime for the Night Safari! We like to get there early to grab dinner beforehand. Beware of public holidays, where an unforeseen swarm of people tend to descend upon the park. Halloween is extra fun with their night activities."
,,A Night Safari,4.0,,A fun experience for the whole family... a tram ride through the evening where you can travel through the zoo and also exit the tram and walk to see even more. It is cooler at night and still exciting. Many good food outlets and gift shops as well as a fun live show at the end.
,,Night safari,5.0,,"Tram ride in tha night will give the wild life at night which is most uncommon for any visitor.

No photographs allowed meaning no flashing at wild animals.

Suggest carry good quality night vision cameras for capturing photos. Or simply enjoy the ride.

Another attraction is the fire show don't miss it.

Lot of food stalls mementoes purchases can be done.

One common feature at all the parks or locations is that they capture your photos and display at the exit side for you to purchase. Cost is high. Since now a days every one is expert in taking selfies on mobiles you can save the money with out purchasing them except you have a strong desire for a photo memento instantly."
,,Lots to see,5.0,,So many animals in the night zoo and it's the first one in the world. Animals are in good condition and clean.
,,Good place,4.0,,"the zoo is very big tired to walk , do take the tram but you cannot see much as is very dark . got fire show."
,,Take a tripod,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari the night we arrived in Singapore. It is a great way to spend time with family and reverting back to childlike wonderment seeing all the animals. The zoo is set in a fantastic jungle setting next to a big beautiful lake which drew gasps from the people on our tram. It was incredible how close we got to the animals, it is a very well designed zoo. I would recommend taking a tripod to use with your camera as you cannot use your flash so it is very difficult to get good photos in the evening."
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,4.0,,"Rather than visiting this excellent zoo during daylight hours we opted to go on a 'Night Safari'. We managed to get '2for1' tickets and went as a small family group, (grandparents, mum and dad and 4 year old child). There was something for us all to enjoy!
While queuing for the safari to start we enjoyed watching the spectacular fire eaters. These continued performing every so often until well into the evening in order to entertain guests as they arrived.
As darkness fell we were channelled onto roofed, open sided little trains that departed every few minutes along trails winding through the zoo. We passed different habitats, expertly described by an English speaking guide, and saw a wide range of creatures including elephants, lions, giraffes as well as smaller, less spectacular ones such as hyenas and flamingos. There were 4 different stations where you could alight and go on foot to explore further. These footpaths were well signposted. There was the opportunity at one station to go to an open air show that showcased some 'creatures of the night' - worth making time for. Had we not had a 4 year old in tow we could have spent much longer at the zoo than our 2 hours or so there. There were gift shops and a variety of eating and drinking venues near the entrance, plenty for young adults wanting to have a night out with a difference.
I would certainly recommend going on this night safari especially if regular zoo visits usually leave you cold. Here you're seeing many animals when they are at their most active (the lions could be heard roaring) but if you are set on seeing all the many different animals in this zoo, then go in the daytime! For the night safari the areas open to visit are fewer and also I often found it quite tough to spot the smaller creatures since there is only minimal low lighting. However, for me, the experience of this Night Safari was one to be remembered - a great success!"
,,Wildlife at Night,3.0,,"Great to experience the wild animals in natural habitat, although we didn't get to see them all!! Tip: do the show first as the queues for the buses was long and very hot and humid."
,,Night Safari at the Zoo,3.0,,"Reasonably priced, but not really a night safari. Interesting tram ride that takes you through the zoo to see the animals. Excellent food. Nice way to spend an evening"
,,A Marketing Hype and Disaster,1.0,,My strong advise is to stay away from this location. Its a pure Marketing Gimmick! You gonna spend hundreds of $$$ and completely worthless.
,,Waste of time and money. Elephant was clearly distressed :-(,2.0,,"We'd heard great reviews of the night safari at Singapore Zoo but were disappointed with our trip. The zoo is some way out of town and a 40 minute taxi journey for us. On arrival you are shepherded to land trains which take you around the zoo for around 45 minutes. It's obviously a night safari and it's sold to you as seeing the animals in their natural habitat at night, and it suggests that some of them will be pretty active. We saw numerous different species of deer and antelope but very little of anything else. The visibility isn't great (the haze didn't help) as the lighting is low, so it's difficult to see anything much anyway.
We were saddened to see the old male elephant on his own, rocking from side to side, which is a sign of stress. He was understandably separated from the herd but it was awful to see him so miserable.
Other than this, which ruined our trip frankly, the zoo does look very good in terms of the animals having a certain amount of freedom to roam. That said, they don't have big pens/areas so their roaming is limited anyway.
We wouldn't go back. Ever."
,,Good for 1st timers,4.0,,We have been to Kenya safari so of course can't compare with that. It is good for 1st timers who have never seen safari before. We took a tram ride after much wait n we thought that all the animals were drugged as they were in a set position of the light n palm to have a good watch which was interesting.
,,A Night Safari!,4.0,,"This was great fun. I have been to many great Zoos in San Diego and Washington, DC... but the night Safari is unique. The start time varies depending on the time of year and takes about 45 min for the tramride tour. What is really fun is you actually ride through the zoo at night through the animals... and there are no cages. The Zoo is about a 30 min taxi ride from the city and the entrance fee is SG$42.00."
,,"my son and me, and alot of walking",5.0,,"walk , walk and walk... if you want to take your little kids then you better bring a stroller..my son could not handle the walking, dont miss the night safari ..it worth it.."
,,Relax and enjoy the wildlife,4.0,,"The Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo is a great way to spend an evening with either the family or as I did, on a date. Escape the heat of the day, sit back relax and enjoy the active wildlife by night whilst you are taxi'd around by Safari shuttle. Pleasantly surprised by this adventure highly recommend it."
,,Can't moan. Saw almost every animal. Wasn't busy,4.0,,"We went on a Wednesday
Not many people about so breezed around effortlessly. Saw almost every animal up close.
No ques for the tram just got straight on.
People mention the food is expensive but come on guys all attractions have high prices so why are you surprised?? (I didn't eat there) Had a meal before I went. :p

Don't take a camera because you can't take pictures and that's a good thing. Someone left their flash on and it dazzled an animal. The rest of the tram carriage were tutting at the couple which was amusing.

Loved the fishing cats as they were actually fishing for fish :)"
,,Awesome Experience once in a lifetime,5.0,,"I was skeptical about this night safari thing..when our tour operator took us there I was not very sure of what the outcome would be... But my my I must say that it was an experience of a life time,!!!!"
,,One of Top 5 Must See..,5.0,,Night Safari is itself to find yourself with animals in the dark night.. Have elephant Ride.. Don't forget to have Dinner at night safari.
,,Nice experience and popular among tourists,4.0,,Nice concept for a zoo to have the night safari. It is really clean and I still feel safe exploring this part of the zoo at night.
,,"Expensive if you do all the options, but worth it!",5.0,,"I did the combined zoo package with the aquarium/wetlands tour and the night safari. The zoo itself is top tier, but it is the other options which make this zoo really stand out in the world. The river safari has all the world's major rivers attractions. The night safari is popular with locals."
,,Nice place but atrocious food cost,3.0,,The night safari was very good to visit and to see the animals in a pseudo natural habitat was interesting. The major concern was the cost of food. For the same food at night safari and Singapore zoo in the day it was almost three times the cost which is a rip off.
,,Well worth a visit for animal lovers,5.0,,Does not come much better. Only in Africa can you enjoy more. Snow leopards are so beautiful. Worth every penny went on a tour
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,Choose an adventurer tour with a personal guide well worth the extra for Walter's knowledge of the animals and conservation
,,Great experiece especially for kids.,5.0,,"Its a very different experience. The animals are not too any. However the overall experience to visit a jungle in the night is good. The tram ride is a must. Also to ensure that you really get a feel of the jungle it is recommended that you take one of the walking trails. The shows are very nice. however one must reach the venue ten minutes before to get a good seat. At the end of the safari, we were famished. We got decent food, howver most stalls were closing down. It was 10:30. So time your visit accordingly."
,,Really good ideea,5.0,,"It was the first time I saw this idea in a zoo, liked the concept, great storytelling on the cart that takes you aroun, good sound, easy to see the animals, funny 30min show at the end of the tour, a refreshing experience after a hard day in the city"
,,Good both day and night safari,5.0,,"I went for the night safari while my wife visited it earlier during the day; both have been really happy with the visit, good setup, good story and activities, worth visiting. Night safari is a great idea, first time I see it in a zoo."
,,Not worth the time or money,2.0,,"My wife and I signed up for the duo ticket of zoo and night safari - this reviews the night safari which we visited immediately after the zoo. It was a Saturday afternoon/evening and maybe that made it worse but the vast majority of animals we saw were of the human species.

We skipped the tram ride because of the queues, the stench of petrol from the fire show stage and the noise/behaviour of those queuing. The walking trails were not up to much - most enclosures too dark to see anything (cell phones and flashlights were being used by those who had them - rather disrupts the experience and the animals), and most animals we could see were sleeping or not doing anything different to that which they would be doing in a daytime zoo (and we had seen most of them in the zoo already). We sadly could still hear the trams going around with their repetitive explanations of the animals (glad we skipped the tram - they were only for larger animals and never stopped for those inside to appreciate the animals, if they could actually see them; most if not all animals were theoretically still visible from the walking paths). I've been to enough zoos that simply make darkened buildings and enclosures for smaller nocturnal animals. This could easily be done at the zoo for the smaller creatures. For the larger ones, the night time experience did nothing for us to appreciate them or their behaviour any more than seeing them in the daytime zoo.

As an animal lover, I would not personally go back to the night safari even if it was free. If you want a night time walk among trees, go to the botanic gardens. Rather stick to the day zoo - you'll see more and enjoy the experience."
,,Great but eat before you go,4.0,,"So close to animals such as lions, elephants and hippos. A bit expensive for food and souvenirs, particularly food - Nearly $20 for a hot dog meal"
,,Must-do attraction,5.0,,"Of all of the zoo attractions, the night safari was my favourite. It is such a unique concept it and very well executed. We went mid-week and queued up for almost an hour to get on the tram ride around the park, which is the only way you can see some of the animals. We also walked most of the trails and both ways you get an up-close encounter with the animals. A must-see in my opinion."
,,Up close and personal!,4.0,,"A great family outing, we went midweek and did not suffer any long waiting times. Whether you walk the trails or enjoy the tram ride you'll feel like you're right in amongst the herds. No flash photography, so you'll need a good camera to get difficult low light pictures."
,,Average,3.0,,If you have a poor eye sight then it is hard for you to see some of the animals because the lights are dim. Not good for the value of money. It is not like other attraction that you'll crave to come back.
,,NIght Safari (really),3.0,,"This is a well received attraction and I am surprised. Though for the most part it is well organized it is not something I would have traveled to see. Remember it is dark and you get a 40 minute ride on a trolley to get a glimpse of some rather interesting animals, but not worth the time or money. The best part of this was the free entertainment of fire eaters at the front. Which is free and should be a charge since many of the other venues such as the show in the stadium is terrible. Many other things to visit while in Singapore then this attraction."
,,Fantastic concept,4.0,,We went on an organised tour to The Night Safari which gave us guaranteed train ride although I would say everyone gets on and the tour wasn't long enough as the park closes at midnight. Loved driving around the park in the little train to see the animals at night. Would have loved more time to do the four walking trails as well. The fire twirlers near the entrance at 9 pm were hot. We at food and sat at the tables for a good view. Had some very good n
,,Animals all have their Equity Card.,3.0,,Amazingly the animals all performed as though they had read the script! It was quite breathtaking. This is a very popular attraction so avoid weekends like the plague if you can as lines/queues are long even on a mid week night with no respite.
,,Best of the four animal and bird parks!,5.0,,This was by far the best out of the four animal and bird parks! The tram ride was surprisingly very relaxing on a hot night and the creatures of the night show was very funny and well presented! There were lots of species of deer on the tram ride!:) TIP get there early and go to the first creatures of the night show before going on the tram ride!
,,Lovely,5.0,,We made the mistake of visiting on a weekend night and the queue was soooo long! Worth the wait though. Pls get enough carrot juice into your system a few days in advance as that will help with your night vision.
,,Opened at night.,1.0,,"Unless you have the eyes of a night predator, you can't see much. Fire dancer show you can see at the entrance without a ticket. Tram ride extra fee is outrageous and they don't even check to see if you paid for it."
,,Not bad,3.0,,Great fire twirling and fire breathing show at the entry point. Spectacular skills. It is dark so you will struggle to clearly see many of the animals. They drive you around and at some points you are very close to some animals. Takes about an hour to do the loop. You can get off and walk a bit but a couple of hours is plenty. We paid full price but there are discounts for on line purchase or coupons. Not cheap but animals require a lot of care and attention. We used public transport to get there which is very cheap and fairly straightforward if you buy the mrt metro card. Bus takes you from a metro station all the way to the well signed Singapore Zoo. I think it's just a bit too dark so I wouldn't do it again. Once is ok.
,,Pricey zoo!,3.0,,"I enjoyed my visit but at a cost of $35 per adult, this attraction seem pricey for a family.

The lines to take the tarm was pretty long, but it took less than 10 minutes for us to get on a ride. Given each tram is 3 sections long and estimated to seat 40-50 pax per tram, the queue is quite manageable. So don't be scared off by the snaking queues.Once inside the night safari, you will face scores of human traffic queueing up of the tram ride.

Since this is a night zoo, it was almost impossible to get a good shot of the animals on the camera. Even though the tram is slow moving, the combination of low light and movement makes every pictures a blurry yet somewhat artistic photos

Kids will enjoy this activity, But for us adults... nahh!."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Excellent , must visit place, save for noisy tourists who dont adhere to basic courtesy to animals. A beautifully laid out place.. but visitors must be patient and ready to stand in long queues."
,,Very good and different,4.0,,"If you have done lots of zoos, this is a bit different.

Seeing animals at dusk give a whole different aspect and there was lots happening.

Most people do the team ride (which is a must) but it is also worthwhile walking around the park. You walk a different route as you are not allowed to walk on the team route.

Queues were quite big but moved quite quickly."
,,Interesting but not amazing,3.0,,"Getting to the zoo takes a bit of time if you are using public transport so remember to leave time for this. we got entry at 9pm, and were worried that this wouldn't give us enough time for everything but it was, with the added bonus of no queues for anything.

The Creatures of the Night show was entertaining but it was a bit disappointing that they weren't given more time on each one. It is aimed more at kids than adults, although the snake was scary! The tram ride is a must, it gives some good information about the animals being shown. Don't forget to walk around either!

Having heard that the enclosures are world class, I was disappointed. Granted they are not caged but it seems some of the animals have little space compared to other zoo's I have been to.

All in all, an interesting zoo but could do with more space for some of the animals."
,,Night Safari was really nice,4.0,,the night safari is definitely worthwhile if you're with a date or with family. its very relaxed and its all done on a tram through the zoo that doesnt seem to interfere with anyone using the walking trails within the zoo at the same time. They also have live shows at night which was really nice
,,Singapore Zoo - Night Safari,4.0,,"I enjoyed the night safari. There is no point trying to take photos as no flash photography unless you have a professional camera. I booked this tour online through the website Viator (Tour East Singapore) and they are brilliant at picking you up from your Hotel and getting you back to your hotel. They are very reliable and professional. They staff are friendly, informative and have a great sense of humour. It is best to book through a tour company like Viator as you skip the queues and get straight through the gates in front of the general public as well as next on the tram in front of huge lines of people. Dinner was an optional extra as well which we did and a great selection of food was on offer."
,,"For those not sure, a nocturnal zoo",5.0,,We did this after the Zoo which proved to be a long day with plenty of walking. Some parts of the Zoo are only visible by the tram included in the price. There is a short fire eating show before the park opens and to be clear this is not a night time visit to the Zoo but a separate Zoo nearby. Can be hit & miss whether the animals show but there are plenty of guides to ensure you don't get lost. There os an animal show too. Plenty of taxi's outside by way.
,,A lot to see in too little time,3.0,,"First up it is worth saying that the Night Safari does offer a unique viewing experience. The animals are amazing! But be prepared for queues. Queuing for tix, for entry, for trams. Lots of queues that can SERIOUSLY eat into the time available to see animals. If you have small easily irritated and bored children, this can create lots of opportunities for screaming hysterics. Also therefore not good for anyone unable to cope with long periods of standing.

Walking trails are excellent and many animals to be seen. Fine for strollers and suchlike but there are many slopes and hills so again not advised for anyone who can't handle these.

Because of the queuing, you do need to move briskly around. We didn't see everything as we needed to exit in time to catch 10.30 bus back to city. If you have a private transfer, you may have more time to see everything as the zoo does not shut till midnight.

Tip 1; arrive seriously early to be at front of entry queues. We arrived at 6.30 and entry queue was already out to car park, was 7.30 before we got into the park
Tip 2: there is a MUCH shorter queue to enter and go straight to walking trails rather than trams.
Tip 3: every one seems to rush in and join the next lot of mega queues for the trams. Bypass these and ride them later when the queues lessen. Mosey onto the walking trails or visit the fun but not very long creatures of the night show."
,,A unique experience,4.0,,"We had to wait for well over an hour to get in and get on the tram - you need to turn up early if you want to beat the queues. Once inside, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The tram ride and walking trails were excellent and we actually got to see the animals in the environment as close to their natural habitats as you can get in a city zoo. We had to rush it a bit at the end to make it to the last Creatures of the Night Show, which I did not think was all that great. If you are running short on time, skip the show and explore the park a bit more."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"We did the night safari and it was different. We took the tram first to see the animals which was nice. We walked around on the trails after and it was a better way as you can go at your own pace, see more and spend as much time at each exhibit. The line up for the tram is very long and it was low season when we were there."
,,Another View of Animals,5.0,,Riding in the dark and looking at animals in their natural habitat is exciting. It lightly rained the night we were there and this added to the enjoymment of seeing the animals at night with the glistening of the water on theri skin.
,,A night of entertainment.,5.0,,"I did the night safari and loved every minute of it.

The buffet was ok but lets be honest the real reason you are there is to the see the animals and be entertained. The safari was good fun however no photos are to be taken out of respect to the animals health (blinding light) which i completely understand and it didn't bother me the slightest. Once we completed the safari we went back to the main area where there was loads of entertainment."
,,Better than expected !!,5.0,,"I am not a real fan of zoos, but when me and my wife were on our honeymoon, some of our friends chipped in and got this for us. but Singapore Zoo isn't like any other zoo, you don't feel as though you are in a zoo at all. It is very spacious and the animals seem really happy and well fed!

we booked on the private guided tour and that was fun too, as our guide gave us many stories and information that we would of most probably of missed.

The zoo is in a beautiful setting with lakes and gardens all around. A must see if you have any time in Singapore."
,,A great night and a unique experience,4.0,,Yes it's as good as they say. It started off well when a group of business men in the queue gave us a free ticket Went mid week and the queue for the bus tour reminded me of Universal Studios but it moved quite quickly. A great way to get up close and personal with all manner of wandering animals.
,,A different kind of zoo,4.0,,"Tried to book tickets online before leaving Australia but there were no tickets available for entry before 9.30pm so opted for a Viator tour which included the buffet dinner. It was welll organised and the buffet had a good variety of food and was better than expected.
The good thing about going with the tour is that you get to skip the queue for the tram and board as soon as dinner is finished.
The tram tour was good, saw lots of animals, some very close to the tram. The lion especially was magnificent.
The 2 shows were good, particularly the fire show near the entrance, don't miss this.
We had to board our bus soon after the Creatures of the Night show finished so we didn't get to explore any of the walking trails which was the only disappointment.
Overall it was a very enjoyable and unique evening which we would recommend to all animal lovers."
,,Night zoo disappointing,2.0,,We went to the night zoo. Pretty crowded with lines of people awaiting the little trains. Did not see many animals. Would only recommend if you have nothing else to do
,,Night tour,3.0,,this was a great way to visit the zoo. unfortunately some tourists decided to take photos when we were explicitly told no photos so this type of behaviour detracted from our experience. all in all we were happy that we took the time to visit
,,A must see,5.0,,This is the second trip to do the Night Safari and it was just as good and enjoyable. It's a bit out of the City and the queues are never ending but it all moves smoothly and once you are on the train it's all worth it. Definitely a top of the to do list.
,,Lots of fun!,5.0,,"What a neat night! The restaurants for dinner are great, loads to choose from. Really neat to see the animals roaming around at night and so close to us"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,What can I say? It was dark; the animals must have been tired.. We could barely see anything - and there was not much to see.
,,A unique experience,4.0,,"A different and exciting experience...watching wild animals from a length of hand only, with no fences and in a comfortable tram, perfect way to end your night in Singapore. We booked this tour via Asia Web Direct which included pick-up and drop from hotel, skipping the line. Pick up time was 06:00 pm (sharp). If you love seeing animals from very near that this is a must do activity while in Singapore."
,,Experience of a different kind!,4.0,,You get to see the huge range of wild life in their natural habitat in an interesting manner - riding inside a tram! The free fire show and animal show is a must see! The food variety in the food stalls and gift shops makes it a one stop shop for a lovely evening outing for all ages. The entrance was a show stopper-beautiful! It's accessible via public transport or cab for tourists. Highly recommended.
,,Night Safari - A must visit for all..,5.0,,"One of the best tourist place to visit & unearth the nocturnal animals in their natural habitat. Very nicely laid out area with a mono rail tht takes you on a journey of well lit animals areas where one can see them. No flash photography is allowed, as it disturbs the animals during the night."
,,More than expected,5.0,,"A must if you're visiting SG. Definitely much more than what I expected. You can get on the tramp with everyone else and go through the route and et educated on the different animals. And after that, you can go on the other route (only accessible by foot) for a more personal experience. There are also shows/performances through out the evening. Would definitely return again!"
,,a Night safari,5.0,,well maintain animal zone and very friendly staff . specially i the night safari was the best . love the way they arrange
,,Go during the day!,2.0,,"The Saturday night that we visited was the weekend of the country's 50th anniversary celebrations and admittance was free for all Singaporeans. We were told the queue for the train was 1 hour but we actually waited over 2 hours to board. It then only took 40 minutes to view the whole zoo, rather than an hour as we were informed."
,,Absolute Must See,5.0,,Must visit night safari!Great place to visit at night!Food is excellent and the tram ride is a must see must experience!
,,Excellent both for fun and education,5.0,,Nice....many things to see and it was much cooler at night visiting the zoo in Singapore. Kids enjoyed it immensely and you can get there by public transport. Worth a visit if you are a zoo lover...
,,Decent - Go if interestd in wild life,3.0,,"You will simply sit in a tram and it will run you pass through the various wild life, though the wildlife collection is huge and great.
If you are with kids, you may instead go for Singapore zoo, as in night safari you cant go out of the tram (unless you do the walking trail)

The free fire show and the animal shows are wonderful"
,,Must in Singapore,5.0,,I'm generally not a big fan of zoos but the night safari in Singapore is a must experience. You get to see the nocturnal animals that you would miss during daytime. Getting back to the city center afterwards was a bit chaotic so I would plan this very carefully in advance.
,,Good,3.0,,"Its an okay zoo, requires lot of time, but you can see animals in night time that's different otherwise it is pretty ordinary. the animal show is good"
,,Night Safari- An amazing Experience,5.0,,"I am in singapore from 2011, and yet, I did not visit night safari in those 4 years. Atlast, on 28-Sep-2015, I took time off, to visit the night safari with my elderly parents. There was a 50% discount offer on the official website, and i got the tickets for 21sgd/Pax. There are 2 entry times for the night safari. One is at 7:30 P.M and another at 9:30 P.M. I booked the 9:30 P.M night safari. We reached around 8:40 P.M. There is one animal show, ""Creatures of the night"" at 9.00 P.M. We were most unfortunate to have missed the show, coz, it was cancelled that night, due to rain. Around 9:30, the rain abated. We boarded the tram at Tram Station 1. There was an onboard recorded commentary. Flash photography is not allowed. The Night safari was simply awesome. Due to the aftermath of the rain, the climate was cool, and all the animals were lying in their enclosures, very close to the road. The tram will visit each animal area and slow down for us to get a clear view. Getting down from the tram is not allowed. (If you don't want the tram ride, we can walk around the park on our own). We saw giraffe, zebra, Lions, tapir, Flamingo and numerous other animals, really close. It was really a different experience and well organised. The staffs were very helpful and the entire trip, about 40 min, was really well worth the money. It was an amazing experience and should not be missed at any cost. The trip is suited for the whole family."
,,Wonderful night zoo!,4.0,,"This was an excellent experience for our family. We did have to keep the kids up late since it doesn't open until 7:30pm but it was worth it. We rode the tram throughout the property for about 45 minutes and saw most of the highlights. Almost all of the animals were active and visible. The kids were very excited to see them doing more than just standing or laying down as they often do in even the best regular (daytime) zoos. After the tram ride we walked a trail to see some smaller animals close-up. The fishing cats and otters were a highlight. That took about 20 minutes. We could have walked many more trails, but our 5yo couldn't stay up much longer. I guess if you walked every trail it could y=take 4 hours. We also saw a 15 minute fire show that was fun! The only drawback is the night safari is quite far away from the city center and public transport doesn't work well to get there. I would suggest taking a designated bus service if you can."
,,Night safari...,4.0,,"Excellent, you go on a train through the zoo at night, and see all night animals, there is a place you can get off and walk a bit then jump on the next train that comes pasted, we didn't get the dinner option, there are places to eat in the zoo, something a little different, recommend it, my kids loved it they are 10 & 8 years old.."
,,Nice!,4.0,,Went with 4 yr old girl. The queue to get tickets was long. Best to buy online then go and collect to skip the queue. There is a fire show that is outside of the admission zone. The night animal show was quite fun. Then went on tram ride. Took about 2 hours in all. The place starts at 7.30 so should be done by 9.30. The tram ride does not cover all the animals. If u like can walk around to see more.
,,Enjoyable family evening at unique night zoo.,4.0,,"Very enjoyable (though late night) out at Night Safari. Arrived just before 8pm (caught the North/South line MRT and 138 bus from the city - took about a hour to get there so it is worth getting an early start on the journey).

Queued up for the Creatures of the Night show. Entertaining show that showcases some of the animals you will see. Then spent 1.5 hours walking the Fishing Cat, Leopard, East Lodge and Wallaby trails. Finished up with the tram ride around the park which took another 30 mins. Left the park on the 138 back to MRT, hopped on the last North South line train back to the city, but it terminated midway along the line and had to catch a cab the rest of the way.

Great night, lots of walking and animals up close. Recommended for the whole family."
,,One of my best zoo experiences,5.0,,"Normally I go to the zoo, because my daughter forces me. Then I take my camera with me to make sure I don't feel boring. On the Night Safari I couldn't use my camera (well it's dark, no flash allowed, and the animals move). However, I didn't need it, because no single minute was boring. The experience was really great. Animals like wolfs and lions I've seen only sleeping so far. In the night they are active. Furthermore you don't see fences in the zoo. Hence, you really feel very close to the animals. Even to the wolves howling to the moon. (I got a strange feeling in my stomach :-)
In short: Not just another zoo park, but a completely new experience."
,,Worth Visiting when you're not too tired,4.0,,"It was good experience overall. But as we were raoaming in the zoo from the morning , we were kinda little tired. Few animals were sleeping. We covered all the walking trails first and avoided the Tram rush."
,,Good way to Kickstart Singapore Tour !!,4.0,,"Had visited on the day of arrival... Extremely crowded.. .Best is to have dinner at Bongo Burgers at the beginning of the tour or You can end with a Dinner at ULLU ULLU restaurant at the end of the tour ...
Take the tram ride... Tram 1 line is extremely crowded.. may take around 30 min waiting in queue... No unique animals... Just the same old one seen in the night .. but something unique to experience... Keep less expectations and u will enjoy..."
,,Best Night Zoo !,5.0,,"I was here 15 years ago, and have been wanting to come back, & so here am I back with my family and visitors fm overseas. I am happy happy to say its AWESOME & AMAZING! We never regret coming here. Good thing is we purchase park hopper ticket online to escape the queing crowd. Overall was an amazing experience :)"
,,Nocturnal Friends,5.0,,"We went on an organised tour,which meant that we ""Jumped""the queue at the gate,
It is a very popular attraction,supported by Food outlets & souvineer shops,
Prices are very reasonable,enjoy the close-ups with the animals in the night as they graze,either ride the bus or if able walk the trails to get very close,A must do when in Singapore,can be done after the the main Zoo closes,,a short walk away."
,,A fun evening excursion,4.0,,"Even though I've been traveling to Singapore for years, it wasn't until I was there over a weekend with a work associate that we decided to explore the Night Safari. We took a taxi from our hotel on a Friday evening. The lines at the park were not long> The ride itself was quite enjoyable even though there weren't a large number of animals out that evening. The show in the outdoor amphitheater was entertaining for adults and children alike."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"We booked a tour through City Discovery, we were picked up from our hotel by a small van to a central bus location (student quarters) very run down, junky place. We were herded to our air conditioned coach and started our 45min trip to the Night Safari location. It is next to the zoo & River Safari. I enjoyed the night safari, we saw the open enclosures as we sat in the 'train'. You can get off and see other enclosures by yourself. It is a bit over priced for what you get but everything in Singapore is pricey. I would recommend this tour."
,,Excellent zoo,4.0,,I've seen quite many zoo's around the world and I would rank the night safari as one of the best ones yet.
,,"It was amazing, so many animals and so close to see",5.0,,"A must to see when visiting Singapore, I have seen nothing like it before Would definitely visit when I return to Singapore"
,,Just Another Zoo,4.0,,"While the park itself seemed inviting, the speed which the trams tore around the park, seemed to indicate that after you paid the entrance fee, they wanted you out. The trams cannot slow down so you can look at the animals, because they have a pre-recorded commentary and so we rushed past one enclosure to the next.
The show was also a disappointment. Squeezed into the outdoor amphitheater were over a thousand sweaty bodies. A couple of animals were whizzed through and then it was over.
A good variety of animals though."
,,Good for something differenr,3.0,,"We attended the second evening session which wasn't that busy. But trying to see the animals in the dark is quite difficult and some of the larger animals were a bit shy whilst we were there and therefore we couldn't see them. I would recommend for something different to do, but my husband would probably say otherwise!"
,,Night safari very busy,4.0,,"Did the night safari, slightly disappointed, good little show before the trip round. It was very busy and remember to wear plenty of mosquito repellent. Food available but seemed expensive for what it was."
,,Fantastic evening,5.0,,One of the best zoos I have been to. The Night Safari is very well done and interesting to see nocturnal animals in action. Get there early for the food and the fire breathers show.
,,Well maintained zoo,3.0,,Liked: Overall ambience was very good. Good service. Friendly staff. They tried to make the look and feel of the zoo to be as natural as possible. Just wondering though..how come wild animals were so tame!
,,Average,3.0,,"Good idea to book online or pre-purchase tickets otherwise you may not get in by just turning up
Big queues for the park to open at 7 pm then you need to queue again to get o seat in trams ... We bypassed tram queues by electing to do the walking trails ( hopped on tram half way through )
There was extreme haze throughout Singapore which reached a peak the night we attended the night safari .. This affected the viewing quality of the animal exhibits and caused cancellation of some shows
Like most venues the price of food and drinks are excessive and food quality average ...
Would not recommend it as a feature of any Singapore trip ... Maybe daytime visit to zoo would be better

M

Singapore on our stay and it peaked on the evening we did the night"
,,AVOID!!! COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME & MONEY!!!,1.0,,"We arrived at 6.45pm as our tickets stated 7pm entry. Entered park gates at 7.25pm due to volume of people queueing.

Creatures of the night show began at 7.30pm and was a joke. Consisted of about 5 animals each only appearing for about 20 seconds. Most of the show was the host mocking a Japanese guest who'd been called up to the stage.

Following the show we were then hurdled like cattle to the next port of call and queued for 50 minutes to board the tram.

All in all approx 2.5 hours at venue with 1.5 hours spent queueing in humid and severely overcrowded areas.

The venue is money grabbing at every opportunity.

Note that there is also no MRT station so it was also an expensive return journey via taxi.

Overall a complete shambles and we shall be requesting a full refund!"

,,Night Safari is a must,5.0,,"Not a fan of heat so on my visit to Singapore it was pool during the day and attractions at night. Took the wife and kids to Singapore Zoo for the Night Safari. Well worth it. One of the drawbacks of zoos is that a Lot of animals are inactive in the day. But on the night safari in the comfort of mini trains, the place was alive with the sights and sounds of wildlife. Great experience and plenty of closeup encounters."
,,A different experience,4.0,,"Well worth a visit. You get to see lots of different creatures in their natural habitat...i.e. at night. take the train ride, but make sure you go back and take a walk through the different habitats."
,,Don't waste your time,2.0,,Way too many people and not worth the time and effort for the queues for the tram. They need to think of a better system to stagger the crowd so that you can really enjoy this unique night zoo experience. We were also worried about the elephants as they were doing the funny rock back and forth stance.
,,2 in 1 zoo,5.0,,"One of the best zoos in the world. Great daily scheduled performances in both day and night. Yes, it's a night safari in the night apart from the day zoo. I have brought international participants from Chine, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Malaysia, Kazakhnstan, Mongolia, South East Asia etc and they all love it although some may prefer the night safari as it's more breezy..."
,,Exciting evening trip,4.0,,"We had a great time here, and took an organised tour from our hotel.
The heat of the day had subsided making it an enjoyable experience.
Our 6 year old son loved it, you really are so close to the animals, the sounds of the night and the fact that it's so dark just add to the magic.
Definitely one to do with young children."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This is a must do, it is one of the main attractions in Singapore.

The Queues can be long, so its advisable to go on a weekday, it is a very unique experience and its very enjoyable.

Its better to do the Car/Tram ride as it covers everything, The walking trail can be tiring and its not advisable for elderly people.

The Animal show was also good, it was short but kids will enjoy it."
,,"Unique experience, but timing is key",5.0,,"This part of the Zoo is a combination of walking trails and a tram with audio narration. It allows you to get close to the nocturnal animals - very close - without disturbing them too much. The Safari offers a good variety of animals that appear to be well-treated. MAKE SURE TO GO LATE AND ON WEEKDAYS. It can get very crowded and the queues can be long. However, after 9 on a weekday is past the youngest visitors' bed time, so you should be able to enjoy the safari without the crowds."
,,bird show,3.0,,"We visted the Zoo at night which was great, supposedly not as crowded. We enjoyed the train around the zoo and although it is cool to see the animals at night you couldn't see all of them. The bird show was great! It is a plastic fantiastic disneylandish park."
,,Good experience but a bit of a gimmick,3.0,,"Went on the recommendation from a friend. Had to queue to get on the train to take you round the park. The train doesn't stop it just slows down so there wasn't a lot of opportunity to see the animas and many of them were asleep, it being night! The animal show was enjoyable and the food was overpriced! Probably great for kids."
,,Same same but slightly different,3.0,,"Having revisited the Night Safai many times over the years, the excitement at seeing animals at night is waning a little. Like all of us at the end of the day, living in this equatorial heat, the animals are rather listless and sleepy. In contrast, the staff are very lively and helpful! A great place to visit if you are visiting Singapore and are interested in seeing a snapshot of the nocturnal animal world."
,,Unique Attraction,4.0,,"Singapore has one of the great zoos, and Night Safari is quite a unique feature. It provides the opportunity to see wildlife that is most active after dark. It only open at 7PM. We booked our tour from our hotel, and that gave us a priority over the long lines waiting for the tram ride. You also have the option of taking the walking trails. There is a fire dance and an animal show that round out the evening. We were delivered back to our hotel in time for a nightcap."
,,wild. natural and refreshing nocturnal exhibitions of the wild in their natural settings,5.0,,"Night safari is a unique experience from zoo. Opening at 7pm, its a goo place to go after you finished yr river safari or zoo visit. The animals are exhibited in natural looking exhibit behind glass. Most animals are quite active from 8-10pm when keepers are feeding them and keeping the animals active with natural looking enrichment toys. I recommend the team ride which brings you to two loops which showcase free roaming deers, tapirs and you get to see the .majestic bull elephant chawang and the packs of wolves and makayan tigers. The trails include leopard trail where you find the cat family in their nocturnal setting and Australia trail featuring night creatures from Australia and giant first trail where you get to walk on a suspension bridge. I visit night safari almost every year because I never get tired of it because the air is clean cool at night if you want to avoid getting burnt by the sun yet wanting to indulge in nature and communing in the company of the wild. Bingo burgers serve nice lamb burgers and ulu ulu restaurant is good with their garlic buttered naan from their Indian stall."
,,"Huge lines, but pleasant tram ride",4.0,,"The lines are huge. So it is very important to reach quite early around 5.30 to 6.00 PM even though the show opens only after 7.00 PM. Once you enter the park with the ticket, you have to decide whether you want to take the walking trail or stand in the very long queue for the tram. We opted for the tram ( but the general advice I notice is to take the walking trail first and then the tram ). There was a fire show happening once the gates opened and we could see it while standing in line.
The tram ride was pleasant. It took you through different types of forests of the world with the particular animals found in those type. Luckily for us, most of the animals were out and about. There is a unique feeling in catching sight of lions, tigers and other animals in the darkness of the night from the inside a tram. For instance , there were a herd of female elephants visible on the left side and while we were watching them , the audio commentary on the tram asked us to look at the right to catch sight of the tusker. I almost gave a gasp. There he was, quite close standing in the dark, almost hidden by the foliage with only the white tusks being visible. That was a sight !
But once the tram ride ended, it was a bit late and we didn't venture out for the walking trail after that. But for those interested and who had opted for the walking trail first, the queue for the tram seemed to have shortened considerably by that time . So they would have been able to experience both I guess."
,,"Dark, Wild & WOW - Must Visit",5.0,,"Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo is a must visit attraction. 3 options - walk, train or road. All 3 options worth the time.

This is like spending some night time in a real jungle. Close encounters, well organized set up, great crowd management and very safe.

A very special mention to the commentary on the train, well recorded, very intriguing and excellent presentation by the anchor whoever did it. And the message of conservation communicated so well.

You get to see all the animals, no disappointments. I have to mention about the show at the entrance, the fire show, high quality performance,

Go to this place at 8:30pm to avoid big queues.."
,,Live performance was the climax,3.0,,Opted for the tickets inclusive of tram ride. Firstly took the tram and briefly went round the area. Next is by foot to totally comes the area. The highlight of the night was definitely the live show by the staffs performing with the birds and animals :)
,,2nd visit and not disappointed,5.0,,"Being able to see the animals doing what they do at night and so close is a wonderful experience , we saw all the ""cats"" this time, quite humbling, good 4hrs spent walking round and being pleasantly surprised at each stage Would throughly recommend"
,,A respite from concrete,4.0,,So much of Singapore is built up and it's a nice change to head here. But it's still bustling with people. Great food court which I didn't have time to check out. Loads of attractions including the brilliant night safari.
,,Happy Happy Nightssss,5.0,,"How can we start on.. It's was real awesome experience had in our life time while we really enjoyed a night life in a real jungle. See the creatures, animals in the night, who they looks like & whats their life styles. With all the feelings that you are in a forest. Specially we enjoyed the animal show, with well trained animals. Must see.. You cannot convert this experience in to words. Just try... Thanks Night Safari's..."
,,"Busy, humid, good staff - walk first to avoid the crowds.",3.0,,"Overall - worth it, but manage the crowds & wait for them to go in before you do. We then headed off to the right rather than leap onto a tram like everyone else did. This meant we followed the 4 walking trails for the first couple of hours & didn't see too many people until we got back nearer to the entrance. We then jumped on a nearly empty tram for a rest! The team ride is worth it as you visit different areas of the park from the walking trails: be prepared for an interesting if slightly patronising commentary. Seeing the animals at night is interesting & different, but because it's dark you sometimes have to keep still, watch & wait - & look hard! Often they are so well camouflaged you can miss them, & most people just rushed past instead of waiting. We spent nearly 20 mins watching the leopards & the beautiful cloudy leopard whilst others just glanced in, saw nothing & left!
The main message from the park is conservation - habitat being destroyed & aminals on the verge of extinction - all too true sadly. I know a lot of great work is done by the parks, but I did feel that the bigger animals, especially the elephants, needed much more room! I wasn't comfortable with the size of some of the enclosures.
Other reviews have commented that the parks are hard to get to. Taxis are everywhere & good value, & there are 4 different MRT stops where you can easily catch a connecting bus - it took us about 45 mins catching the MRT to Ang Mo Kio & then the 138 bus from B2 in the bus terminal, & likewise in reverse on the way home about 11pm. The last bus goes at 0015 & the park closes at midnight.
Overall, worth a visit, but younger children might be frightened by the dark & the animal noises - that said some may love it!"
,,Must-Visit in Singapore!,5.0,,"I love this place. The set up is great and there's lots of opportunity for close encounters. It's amazing seeing all the animals awake and active. We bring visitors to the city here a lot and have seen lions roaring, hyenas running and playing, jaguars scratching at the glass, tigers engaging in 'adult behaviour', the slow loris!

Pro tip: A lot of people stay after the regular day zoo closes, so it's packed right at opening. Come at 9pm. You won't have to wait in any lines."
,,Best Zoo Experience !!,5.0,,"Cannot beat this for close contact with the animals, and presentation. Just another part of the Singapore Zoo experiences not to be missed!"
,,Go on a weekday and you shall apreciate,3.0,,"I have been to Safar about 5 years ago, and like many others I went to Safari after day long Zoo experience and trust me I hated safari so much that it took me another 5 years to visit it again that was too forced as we had guest at our place and tickets were already booked.

Luckily we went on weekday - Wednesday and have to admit it wasn't as bad as I felt in my 1st experience. Nothing has changed, same fire show, animal show and tram ride. Earlier there was two kind of ride, normal (which is the only ride now) and another helloween tram (where the tram will have ghost sounds and some funny figures appear)

I saw many of other reviewers problem is the long queue, I would say do this. Do not do Zoo and Safari on same day, I know city is too far, cab rides are expensive but when you come to SG and want to really enjoy then do come only for Safari, come on weekday and you shall enjoy the experience.

I would like to come again, may be a year later but want to see some change, some new show or something which makes us believe not everything is trained :) you know what I mean :) yes animals are trained, but that's okay and blessing as we really really get close to them, if they are not trained then one of the deer would have definitely traveled back with us in tram. :)

Enjoy !!"
,,Love it,5.0,,"We had a wonderful night going around the safari on the tourist train. Big open air zoo , open at night only. Very cool and gives you an amazing time. But there are some parts of the zoo which are quite dark , cannot see anything clearly. I have to have my eyes wide open and stare to see what is it we are passing."
,,So worth the visit,5.0,,Go on a tour with a meal and you won't be disappointed in this on food is great tour guides know the stuff and give great information
,,Night tour with meal,5.0,,Absolutely great night getting there in the coach the meal was the greatest couldn't complain the tour it self was the best great information supplied by the tour guide on the animals would do this again in a heartbeat
,,Singapore Night Safari,5.0,,"A visit to the Night Safari is a must.

We are Senior Citizens, and were delighted to be offered a very good discount after showing proof.

We were taken around on an electric tram and the ride lasted about 40 minutes. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the animals and we just wanted the trip to carry on.

Amazing to see the animals so close up in their natural environment. We were lucky to see a family of Anteaters which just ambled past us. So unusual to see them so close our guide told us.

There are several different trails to walk around as well. Very safe, even though the animals are not caged in.

We had dinner in the Restaurant, which was very clean. We found the food very nice and not overpriced.

We have recommended many people to visit, and like ourselves, they consider it to be one of the highlights of a visit to Singapore."
,,Too dark to see,2.0,,"A big disappointment. Hundreds of people queueing to get on a little electric train to ride through the zoo. I could hardly see any animals on the ride: greyish fur on dry greyish background of the garden zoo with no light (obvious - this would blare/frighten animals). Funny show at the end, the only enjoyable element."
,,Nice idea but not as good as expected..,3.0,,"Saw a lot of good reviews of the night safari, see animals at night in there natural envioment with enclosurers mainly enclosed by mounds and pits..the idea was nice but the percentage of the animals you could see from the trams was low...mainly different types of deer...nice to see the elephants...couldn't get any good photos as you can't use flash...the walking section was good and the night animal show okay...get there really early if you want to visit all areas as it gets really busy even on a week night..."
,,Best Night Safari..A must visit place in singapore,5.0,,"It is a very big open air-zoo that opens only at night. It has different zones inside it where the animals are present in an open area. You can explore this zoo on foot or can take a tram also. Tram was a good experience, driver cum guide inside the tram will talk about each and every animal. Animals here are not caged instead kept in an open space.you can also enjoy the show that happens after every half an hour in their amphitheater. Bus stand is right outside the main gate from where you can take a bus to reach transit. In a nutshell.. It was a very different zoo experience.. Must visit it especially with kids."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Be sure to book tickets early because they can sell out that time of year. Night safari was magical. Enclosures are well designed so there are no fences which makes seeing the animals an experience like no other.Some animals were so close to the tram it was possible to reach out and touch them (however i didn't do this in case i frighten the animal ). There are two time slots before 930pm and those whom can enter after 930pm. I pre booked my tickets from Australia and after 930pm was the only time left. With a four yr old i knew this would be difficult but we were desperate to go. Once we arrived in Singapore the humidity clearly affected her because she was well asleep long before 930pm nightly. I called the zoo and they were very accommodating. On arrival at 8pm we were ushered straight to an awaiting to start the safari and my 4 yr old got to see the whole tour. The guide spoke very clear English and was a wealth of knowledge about all the animals. Highly recommended.
,,Great night activity,5.0,,"Caught the open top bus out to the Night Safari which was a fun start to the evening.
On arrival there was a pretty large queue so I stopped for some dinner (loads of different places to choose from but I went for the traditional Hainanese chicken rice) until the queue had died down a little. The Night Safari has 3 main attractions: the tram safari, the shows and the various walking trails.
At opening the most popular is the tram and shows so I decided to start with the walking trails and I have to say I thought this they were excellent! I have been to a lot of zoos and normally its a case of trying to spot the animal in it's enclosure (sometimes without much success) or seeing them sleeping somewhere but here was totally different. I was able to see almost every animal in their enclosure which seemed to be of reasonable size for a zoo. In addition to seeing the animals most of them were actually active; one of the highlights was the fishing cat who, as the name suggests, I spotted fishing for the live fish in it's enclosure. This is probably mostly down to the fact that the animals are mostly nocturnal and the zoo does not add in lots of unnatural lights that interfere with their normal behaviours.
On some of the trails there are also ""walk-through"" areas were you can get up close to some of the animals.
One thing you should do is make sure you have water with you as if you do all of the trails it will be about an hour to an hour and a half walking which is worth it but thirsty work in the heat of Singapore!
After the walking trails the tram safari had become pretty quite so was able to just hop on this without queuing. This part is a guided tour of some of the parts of the zoo that you can't see by foot which was great fun. This takes about 40 mins and you can either get off half way round or continue for the full tour.
All staff members that I met where friendly and helpful and there were plenty around to ask any questions.
The only annoying part of my visit was people ignoring the tram guides and the signs that are all over the zoo stating no flash photography should be used around the animals but other than that it was a great evening out and worth a visit if you are in the area."
,,Don't waste your time or money,1.0,,"We attended the zoo on an on off showery night , but not told til after arrival animal shows don't run in the rain . No back up plans NO EASY way to get home to hotel. Staff were rude ,poorly trained to handle large crowds and to be told after one arrives is not good enough and when we left we asked about the ability to come on another night as show didn't run and queue for train ride was in excess of 2 hours grrrrrrrrr we were just smiled at with a no as the answer .WOULDNT waste your money going !!!!! And food stalls expensive for slop!"
,,lovely place,4.0,,"it was great safari through wild animals so close , it was not just zoo full on entertainment in night , fire dance ,cafe many more things to do .good concept overall ."
,,Fascinating and close encounter,4.0,,Wowwwww. Never imagined to get so close to animals that we actually see on TV. Animals are only a few distance away from us while some reach near to your tram. Of course it is safe since they have taken care of all safety. Wonderful experience to have so close encounter with wild animals. Just be careful with flash cameras. It's better to just sit and enjoy the ride instead of clicking picture which will disturb the animals.
,,Best Zoo I've ever been to!,5.0,,"The Singapore Zoo is so well run and maintained,
I went for the night safari and it was really cool! Everyone knows their stuff and the animals seem to be happy and well treated.
I didn't get to do the morning with the monkeys but I hear it's really good! Something I want to do when I go back one day."
,,WASTE OF TIME,1.0,,"The whole night safari was a waste of $. It was disorganised, everyone arriving at the same time were hearded into disorganised lines. It took ages to get into the actual ques and then the trams were jammed full which made it uncomfortable during the viewing. No maps/ operations or communication for what you can or cannot do were made. Whilst you appreciate it's night and as to not disturb the animals, there was no flash but it was very hard to see anything. I have been to the zoo during the day- much better! The tram ride itself didn't last long, and considering the parks not open that long it felt rushed when you knew you had a bus to catch by 10..... Hugely expensive food and drink too."
,,"Be careful ,day zoo is OK nothing special ..night zoo a waste of good money",3.0,,"day zoo is OK , but don't waste your time in the night zoo , animal shows cancelled if raining and staff are both rude ,unhelpful and untrained !!!! worst part of our Singapore trip was the night zoo.... absolute rubbish waste of time and money!!!!"
,,Crazy fun experience,4.0,,The Zoo is not very big and combined with the river and night safari can be done as a one day trip. Has a good selection of animals and the rain-forest concept is executed extremely well!
,,So fun - even without kids!,5.0,,My dad recommended we visit here and one night after dinner we decided to go for it. So glad we made the drive. Seeing animals at night is a different experience. They have a huge variety I haven't seen in the U.S. zoos & some my boyfriend had not even seen on safari in Africa. The open bus makes you really feel like you're in the bush because in some cases the animals are on the street - right next to you! Loved the design of this place and would recommend to anyone visiting. Its touristy but our cab driver said locals do visit it because it's plain fun no matter what age you are.
,,Good but can understand it might not be for everyone,4.0,,"You might not see as many animals as in the Zoo but the environment is totally different, nice and cooling, the tram guides are also very informative.

Would appreciate more options for dining as the current establishments are over priced with limited food options.

Overall a good place to visit with kids and anyone who prefers seeing animals in a cooling environment in Singapore."
,,Disapointing,3.0,,"We had been told this was a must do but it was pretty average. We went on an organised trip but it felt very rushed. We had booked a dinner as part of the package which was a buffet and was actually quite nice but we only had 25 minutes to queue to get it and eat it and get into queue for ""Safari"" which was basically a trip in a milk float round zoo enclosures - then another queue for the show - there are 3 times the number of guests admitted as there are room for in the show so either be early or miss out - this was ok but better things to do in Singapore."
,,Loved the no barrier between wild life and humans,5.0,,Awesome concept. It was almost like being in the shooting set of animal planet. So close to them. A lot of never seen ever species. I particularly was thrilled by the bat cave. :D
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Did the Night Cruise. Disappointing. Had to stand in line for 40 minutes to get in. All very artificial and not very informative. Nevertheless an interesting experience. Great ride back to the city on the top deck of an open top bus!! Pity, but this was the highlight of the evening."
,,Not so great..!!,3.0,,"Well after long queues and waiting,finally Night Safari started...sitting in tram...all dark and even animals are also not even moving...may be because of some medication or what..!! But apart from fire show rest all was time waste..!!Kids might love this...however not so great or kind of hype created for the place."
,,A must when in singapore,4.0,,"For those who are into zoos like me, this is a must visit when you are in SG. My first time to visit the Night Safari was a decade ago and a LOT (should be) of improvement has been made Loved it before, love it now ❤️

The park closes at midnight, the best time to be there should be around 9pm just after dinner or earlier so you can walk and/or ride the tram"
,,Rare experience,5.0,,it is great experience to watch the night safari we can enjoy the attraction of animals are moving freely and you can see by moving in a tram we if you are in group it is more enjoyable by walking in the safer I feel it worth to enjoy
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Doing this tour again after 3 years-I would have to say do it independantly as Viator wasted alot of time with change-over of buses and tour guide offered no extra insight into the place and actually did the least attractive of the walks -the leopard walk is the best. Also we actually did not have the 4 hours as quoted on the price of the tour.Creatures of the night has somehow gone down-hill with less animals and running commentary they think is funny...... You can book on-line requesting priority so you dont have to line up for the tour trams which leave every couple of minutes -lots of taxis waiting as well.The buffet dinner was excellent
,,Not worth the money or the queueing,2.0,,"We visited the Night Zoo on the weekend of the 50th Anniversary of Singapore's independence and the place was crammed to the brim. We queued for over 2 hours to get the tram even though we were told it would be an hour. Then we were rushed around in less than 40 minutes as the queue was still building. We paid to do this, but citizens of Singapore were able to come in for free. We were also disappointed with the animals (or lack of) on ""show"""
,,Strangely sedated animals and awful food,2.0,,"Given the ratings that this place received, I figured it was a must visit. I took the nighttime safari tour, which took you through tiny exhibits, with seemingly sedated animals. Most of the animals didn't move an inch. The elephants waved their heads and trunks back and forth, showing explicit signs of distress. I'm by no means an activist that demands the animals have miles to roam free, but these animals were nearly domesticated. Deer don't just stand there eating grass while you pass five feet from them.

The worst part, though, was the food. It's one thing to be in the US and to get horrible quality south-east asian food, but this was putrid. Every single food item was horrible - fast food quality. This is Singapore - there's just no excuse to have food that bad. The staff let most of the dishes go empty and did not bother refilling them. Somehow they have plenty of staff running around doing something...but not actually tending to the buffet itself.

The dessert counter featured 4 completely empty ice cream barrels. Half the stations had scraps left. Want something cold to drink besides water? Too bad. Your $42 buffet doesn't come with anything but water, tea or coffee.

You're far better off visiting the elephant sanctuary in Kuala Lumpur and seeing elephants in their real habitat. Or if you're looking for a real safari experience, go...well...anywhere else.

If you have a zoo near you, you can absolutely, unequivocally, skip the Singapore Zoo."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,We absolutely loved the night safari especially on the tram when you are going around and you have animals right next to you we loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to Singapore
,,Appalling zoo,1.0,,"Do not go. We did the night safari and animals were in small cages and there was animal ""entertainment"". The food id dire and expensive. It is hard to get to and just not worth it."
,,Nocturnal Animals in their natural element,5.0,,"This is a great place to see nocturnal animals like lions and tigers in their element. Most zoos open during the day when most nocturnal animals are either sleeping or hiding in the shade. Not so with the night safari. It opens in the evening and is open till late night enabling you to observe these animals in their natural state.

The fun starts even before you enter the park with a fire-eating show called Thumbuakar to the left of the main entrance. Get there early and grab a prime seat at one of the many food stalls in the entrance courtyard - or stand and brave the crowds.

Inside the entrance, an open-sided tram takes you on a tour of the park. Finish the ride and walk the various trails to see your favorite attractions at your own pace. Make sure you make it back in time for the Creatures of the night show which is located near the exit. Animal feedings can be observed on weekends and holidays although the park gets pretty crowded on these days.

Photography is a challenge given the low night light and prohibition on flash photography (thankfully) to prevent stress to the animals. So if you are really interested to preserve your memories, make sure to take an advanced camera and a fast lens. Or forget about it altogether. Your normal point and shoot will be pretty much useless here.

The park is pretty large and you will be pushed for time if you want to cover all the trails. So make sure you arrive early. The entrance courtyard has several food joints to while away the time till the park opens. Given the timings, it is suitable even for business visitors who are busy during the day.

All in all, not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore."
,,not really worth the hype,3.0,,"long queues to get into the tram, i believe a better experience can be availed from the Singapore zoo itself. Due to some issue during the tram ride, we couldn't get in for the animal show, which was big letdown. The fire show was very good with daring stunts by the trio. The darkness and the looming fire was very exciting to watch."
,,Will return again!,4.0,,"We bought the entrance package for the Zoo and the Night Safari. After completing the Zoo, we crossed over to the Night Safari which wasn't open yet and had our dinner at the cafes around. You will see a lot of visitors swarming around, be sure to get there as soon as possible to get a seat! While you're having your dinner, there will be fire performance to kill time while waiting for the gates to open. First things first, decide if you want to take the tram into the safari, or walk. As time was running out, I did not get the chance to travel by foot into the safari. Hence, the tram. It was an approximately 30-45mins ride. Each species of animal in the enclosure, will be announced/explained by the friendly guide. Sometimes the animals will be so close to the tram, you will be able to touch it.
All in all, I would visit again to further explore the safari, by foot."
,,Ok visit,3.0,,"It was dark, so even the animals are dimly lit. My kids think it's cool that we're going to the zoo at night. At least it's not as hot as during the day. I am wondering, though, most of the animals aren't even nocturnals (active during night), so what really is the point of night safari?"
,,Nocturnal Attraction,3.0,,Had heard a lot about Night Safari but was a little disappointed. There was heavy rush and a lot of hustle. The creature of the night show and guided tram ride is good but not worth a visit during night. Very little time is available.
,,One of the most interesting zoos I believe.,5.0,,"I go to the Zoo and Night safari at least once a year with my students .They always have a great time there.We always do a day zoo visit starting at around 1 or 2 pm and then followed by dinner at the 'Night Safari' restaurant(located at the entrance of NS or for the budget conscious,there's Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet(exit of Day Zoo).Then,we head to the night zoo after watching the 'Fire' show,that's also quite exhilarating to watch.Then,head on for the night safari by first doing the tram ride and then watch the night creatures show and then if you still have some energy ,go for a walk-about.It's a whole or half-day outing.If travelling with young ones,do bring along swim wear or any clothes to splash around as there's water park for kids at the day zoo.The kids will definitely enjoy it especially on a hot and humid Singapore afternoon.The Singapore zoo and Night Safari is a MUST !!"
,,The best thing in Singapore,5.0,,"This is by far the best the thing to do in Singapore.
The park is part of the ZOO complex and is focused on nocturnal creatures. Most of the creatures are free roaming and they cross the pathways just before your feet.
The park opens at 19:00 and the people start queueing somewhere around 5:30 so by the time the entrance opens there is a huge queue. It seemed to me longer than the one for the vatican museums.
Now once the people start getting in it is really fast.
You have two options - if you want you can go with the bulk and wait a lot for the shows or the tram ride.
OR
You can start your visit by hiking the trails first. Now, the trails are super easy and there are almost no people. Check the leaflet carefully as there are several feeding times. We actually saw the tiger eat a few pork chops :) The pure excitement of the hyenas when they smelled the food was insane and scary.
Once you have trekked the trails you can go enjoy the wildlife show, the fire show or catch the tram.
The tram ride goes through a part of the park that is not accessible by other means. It has an english tour guide (prerecorded) which tells you what to expected.

When going to the shows - go half an hour early. Although you'll have to wait in line just to get in - you'l be able to choose better seats. And that is an advantage because the theatre gets packed, event the stairs are used as chairs."
,,Recommended experience,5.0,,"When we first arrived it was a bit Disney like, shows to one side on a schedule and the 'trams' to take you around the resort so we started with some trepidation. However, we recognised the short show was targeted at the children and know our two boys when small would have loved it. The tram gave you the overview before we set out on foot o the four walks. Which turned out to be the real gem of the event, fantastic. My wife and I were simply blown away."
,,Night visit to Singapore Zoo.,4.0,,Went to the night zoo. Long queues to get into zoo and even longer queues for the train that takes you round the zoo! Very hot as well which didn't help with the waiting. The animal show & train (once you were on board) were very good. Seeing the White tiger was the highlight for us.
,,Good tour,3.0,,"This was a good tour and we had a great tour guide but we did feel a little rushed. It is worth doing as a tour as you jumped the line, as otherwise you have to line up for a few hours. I loved that the animals weren't behind glass."
,,"Singapore's precious, prized gem",5.0,,"This can be considered the precious, prized gem of Singapore. I have not been to other night safari in the world but this one is mesmerising. Walk and take the tram, both are strongly recommended. It's a fascinating experience not to be missed if you are in Singapore"
,,Fun way to spend a night,3.0,,Get there early as the queues can be huge!! Wonder around by yourself but expect to miss some of the animals as they are often hiding away. Take mosquito repellent
,,A Must See Wether you Love animals or not,5.0,,The Best Kept Secret In Singapore THE NIGHT ZOO SAFARI To see the Nocturnal Animals in their night time behaviour and the Spectacuar Shows incorporating animals and then the fire eaters perform is a spectacle not to be mssed
,,Excellent night out,5.0,,Excellent evening event that was very enjoyable. The whole thing is very well done and the animals seemed cared for.
,,night safari,4.0,,"it was strange seeing all these animals under floodlights but pleasantly surprising,we all agreed it was better than through the day as we never went into any enclosure where the animals were not on show,you could see the animals very clearly and really would recommend the night safari"
,,Amazing tram ride,4.0,,"As I have grown up in Singapore, my parents have always brought us to the Zoo and Night Safari! Both the places are a must see if you visit Singapore, and can be done in one day! The Night Safari has an amazing and beautiful tram ride, which is roughly 45 mins long! The night show is great too! However I wouldn't suggest walking around the Night Safari as its a very long walk, especially not recommended if you have already spent the day at the Zoo! The fire show is a must too, and it's absolutely free of charge:)"
,,less animals hardly visible,3.0,,Best is the concept to view animals at night but at same time it is very short trip. Expensive as it is out of the city and opens around 7 in evening.
,,Great place to visit at night,5.0,,Excellent zoo to visit went in the evening and saw a live show and all the animals that come out at night to feded
,,Wonderful attraction,5.0,,Was here in 2005 - long time ago I know but this attraction is a must see for anyone in Singapore who wishes to see exotic animals in their habitat at night! Like something from the Jurassic Park movies it really has a magical feel and i will go again the next time I am in Singapore....
,,Great night but not enough time to see everything,4.0,,"We booked tickets through our hotel for the Singapore Zoo Night Safari, and had a great time. We were picked up at our hotel, then transferred to a larger bus for the 30 minute trip to the zoo.
Pre-purchasing our tickets allowed us to skip most of the queuing, and we were seated on one of the first train trips of the night around the zoo. I was impressed at the layout of the zoo, with minimal barriers between us and the animals. The night lighting was low, but allowed us quite a good view of the animals. There was even a couple of animals (tapirs and antelope) on the roadway which came close to our trailers. However, the lighting was not good enough for decent photos (the moving trailers don't give you the opportunity for long exposure photography). Unfortunately, there were a few people who continually ignored the instructions about 'NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY'. I don't know what they hoped to achieve, as most animals were at least 20m away, but they also scared a few off into the dark.
The Night Show, which showcased a few smaller animals was a little disappointing, and in in hindsight, the 45 minutes could have been better spent walking 1 or 2 of the night trails.
The other disappointing aspect was the high cost of food and drink. We had about 20 minutes to wait for our bus trip home, and considered buying a meal. But a hamburger was close to $20, a beer was around $13 while a cocktail was about $18. We ended having dinner later in the evening when we arrived back in town."
,,Lovely Little Safari,4.0,,The safari is obviously not the same as going to Africa but its worth going. The animals are mostly from Asia and you do get to see a lot. I would suggest booking the tickets online as the queues can get quite long and the waiting period can be quite tiring. I would suggest to get there early as possible to avoid crowds. The bus ride to the Night Safari can quite tiring as it takes quite awhile if there is traffic.
,,A Little Over Rated I thnk,3.0,,"We booked a package which in itself was good. It included hotel pickup, Transport to the zoo, dinner, booked seat on a private zoo tram tour and transport back to out hotel. No faults in this. But I do think the actual night zoo tour on the tram (is that the correct term) is over rated. There were a lot of uninteresting animals, dogs, deer, pigs etc and whilst there were a few outstanding animals such as the white lions and elephants they were no different to seeing them in the day time. I must say I did not get excited over the event.
The big tip is to book a tour otherwise you will spend a lot of time in line with a lot of family groups waiting for a seat on a tram."
,,What a place it is,5.0,,This is one of the better locations in Singapore that we should visit in the evening. There is a ride for visitors to go through every single place in the zoo. I have lots of good memories there. Just amazing!
,,Stand in line then stand in line again,1.0,,"This was an epic disaster unless you like queueing for hours on end. My wife and I visited the night safari recently whilst on our honeymoon. We had spent the day at the Singapore zoo during the day killing time until the night safari as this was supposed to be a must. After standing queueing for over an hour just to get in, we then had the decision to make…queue for yet another hour to get on the trams or queue for an hour to see the show. We opted for the show which was a major disappointment as it was definitely aimed more for children. We left the show early hoping to get on a tram only to be greeted by yet another massive queue. As the last bus from the zoo is 10pm we opted to give up on this already disastrous trip and head back to the heart of Singapore on the bus. We only had 5 nights in Singapore and we feel that a full day of our honeymoon was wasted on the zoo and night safari when it could've been spent elsewhere enjoying some of Singapores real delights."
,,Loads of people but lots to see!,4.0,,"When we arrived we waited in line for 45 minutes just to get in but the staff were really friendly.
The creatures of the night show was so entertaining!
We took the walking tracks first and saw so many cool animals, after we'd exhausted the tracks (and ourselves) we hopped on the tram for the tram tour and saw the rest of the animals.
It was a really good night out!
Despite the huge amount of people I would do it again!"
,,Too Crowded & Over Rated..,2.0,,Too crowded and it starts entry at 7 pm and is open till 12 midnight but travel agent take you back by 9.30 pm so you could only finish a tram ride and Creatures of the night Show. As your major times goes in entry and Tram Queue. Experience is tiring and irritating. Not worth it.
,,Great....,4.0,,Nice Experience to have during night time . Can see Animals. Can go by tram car or can walk also....Walking might be exciting but could be tiring though....
,,Night out at the safari,5.0,,"First time going to a zoo at night. Fell like a totally different atmosphere as we normally go to zoo in the morning or noon. Dont have to worry on the darkness.. you will view the animals. there is 2 show at the park but the fire show is good. the animals show is so-so.
There is a tram to drive you around the park but some animals you need to see them by walking.
Worth a visit."
,,Tips to avoid queues,5.0,,"This is a very popular attraction where you get to be close up with many nocturnal animals and majestic creatures like elephants, tigers and lions. The popularity meant very long queues for the tram rides right after opening. My tip to minimise waiting time is to watch the Creatures of the Night Show at 7.30pm (located to the right after entrance), do the 3 walking trails and then take the tram. This lets you avoid the peak hours for the tram ride and show."
,,A Must Do,5.0,,"Whilst in Singapore, do not miss the Night Safari. It was fabulous, especially the tram ride. A very enjoyanle and interesting night."
,,Tired of waiting,3.0,,"it was very crowded at night ...... waited for 2 hours............ if you are going with elders, it would be a bad experience like i did."
,,Must do,5.0,,"Wonderful must do,best to go with a tour guide so you miss all the lines. Well organized and synchronized programme. Wear comfortable shoes and take a back pack"
,,Great night out,4.0,,"A very unique way to see these nocturnal animals which you usually don't see during the day at your normal zoos.

Massive crowds so be prepared to shoulder your way around a hot sweaty mass of humans.

Don't bother queueing for the trams to begin with. Start with the creatures of the night show then start walking the trails. This should put you at the lion enclosure on time for feeding.
Walk the rails first and by the time your done the crowds will have thinned out so you can get straight on a tram."
,,Great place,5.0,,We have been to many zoos mostly in the US. I would rate this zoo in the top 5 of where we have been. Very cool concept to see all the nocturnal animals. I suggest visiting the zoo or bird park during the day and buying your tickets then. Also if you get in line early try to stay to the left. That way you will be closer to the fire dancers before they open the door. You will also get on one of the first trams and see the most activity since they seem to feed the animals just as they open the doors. The walking path is also worth the time.
,,Crowded & Over-Priced,3.0,,"Conceptually the Night Safari isnt bad.. but its the execution and over-pricing which would want one to give it a miss.

Too Less to do.. The Tram Ride is far too dark to be able to see the animals. The animal show is over hyped and i have seen better one's. Overall.. It feels as though you are a part of huge crowd and can swirl in directions if you arent careful coz. of it.

Better to Visit the zoo during the day."
,,Wouldn't go again,2.0,,So I was dragged along to this by a friend. There are places to eat before you go in but not a great selection so eat before you come. We did the trail which was quite good but the enclosures were quite small for some of the animals which was hard to see. Others had plenty of room so want all doom and gloom and I have to say I throughly enjoyed the night animal show.
,,Tourist trap,2.0,,Really a tourist trap. Nothing much to see if you ever went to zoo in America. Expensive for what it is. I went to the night safari and the long waiting line to see 'Lion and Pig' in the dark.
,,Very unique experience,4.0,,This is probably the only night safari. Must do. Don't miss fire stunt show. We went through taxi (uber) which i prefer in every country i visit to save money. And got back to hotel by double decker open bus service hippo available at exit door. Spectacular views of city in just 5 dollars and cold breeze. Dropped at orchard road. One of the best day in my singapore visit
,,Good experience.,4.0,,It was a good experience since it was my first night safari. The tribal dance at the beginning of the show was a show stopper. Very well managed and great eateries outside.
,,A good night out,4.0,,"We booked this as part of a zoo combo ticket and arrived about 8pm.

What they don't tell you is that there are shows earlier in the evenings which you need to be there for and that the night safari train becomes very quiet later.

Not knowing this we chose to do the train ride first and then the walking trails, in hindsight we should have done it the opposite way around as if would have been a more efficient use of our time.

The zoo was well laid out and you get to see some of the animals that you would at the day zoo. The animals were reasonably active, and the highlight was seeing the bull elephant.

A good night out, but a better system of advising/dispersing the crowds would have made it a 5.

On a side note the food was better than at the zoo and well priced."
,,Anand Patel,2.0,,If u do the zoo is more than enough...the que for the night safari and the tram that takes you around are just too long especially if you r travelling with younger kids. Most of the animals u will c will be from afar. I would also not recommend the river safari as well.
,,Not so Good,2.0,,"I couldn't find it Worth , because it is like a Open Zoo , having Lights . A lot of rush , but not managed Properly . Fire Show is definitely Better ."
,,"Good Experience , Fun",4.0,,"This can get a bit crowded, avoid weekends if possible. There are essentially three things to do here , walking trails , tram ride and shows. The gates open 7.00 or 7.30 (need to check) , ticket office open and food options outside available from 5.30, plus a show. Its also easy to get tickets earlier online.

The biggest tip is not to queue at opening time for the trams. When you have got tickets go straight in and walk the walking trails and take in the 20 minute show (timetable on line). Go for the 40 minute tram ride later in the evening , there will be no queues. Take a look online at the Night Safari website, their suggested itineraries are good.

As for the attraction itself I have been a couple of times with visitors and all age groups enjoyed. The walking trails are not that long , you can go at your own speed and focus on the animals that you want to see. The tram ride is great , informative and educational and the shows fun.

Lots of animals to see and a unique experience."
,,Fixing,5.0,,Great Coordination between curators and animals. Seems as if the animals are trained to come out seeing the visitors.
,,Not worth it at all,2.0,,There are some nice animals but nothing different than a normal zoo. I'd advise to take the evening off and do something else. Pricey too.
,,Not A Great Night,2.0,,"This was a bad decision by us. Should have just gone to the Day Zoo, which many around us raved about. The whole process from City Hotel pickup to drop-off was exhausting in the heat.
Pickup was delayed, queues for the Safari shuttle was a pain.

Should've booked an express ticket, and just added this experience to the main zoo day ticket. Wouldn't recommend the Night Safari on its own.
However have no doubt the Day Zoo ticket with a Night Safari ticket on the back of it, eating at the complex would probably work."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"You can take this attraction after going to the Singapore Zoo or the River Safari, but if you don't want to have animal kingdom overload, this will be okay to take in one night without the other nearby attraction. But better come early because the queue will be long when the gate opens.

There are several attractions inside but if you want to see the shows, better queue for those first. Don't miss the tram rides and watch out for the leopards!

This is a place for everyone, including adults. But since there are no flash photography allowed, you must have a really good camera to get clearer pictures of the nocturnal animals."
,,Excellent Zoo,5.0,,This is a really good zoo. There is lots to see and do there. The Night Zoo is a must we throughly enjoyed it there.
,,Night experience at a zoo,5.0,,Family and friends fun and educational trip to the Night Safari in Singapore evethough the entrance fee is considered high for us but I think it is really worth the while and the price we paid for
,,One thing to do while in Singapore,4.0,,"The experience is unique and exciting, seeing the animals at night in their normal habitat. There is a train that will take you though but you can also go off the train and do some trails and animals you cannot see while on the train. Tip: you can get a free ride from Orchid Street tourist center to the Night Safari and buy the ticket from them too. Makes things much easier and cheaper than taxi to there. The way back take the same bus for 5$. Enjoy!"
,,Good visit,4.0,,"The safari was bit crowded when we visited. If it is crowded, take the walking path rather than waiting for the tram. You can get into tram in the middle at a stop point if any come with free seats. We were lucky to get in the tram in the middle. Overall good experience with the animals."
,,It's a amazing experience ever for a Night viewing of wild animals.,4.0,,"First ever man made created Night Safari. major attractions is FIRE SHOW (where you will full and thrill yourself) must see this. Even NIGHT CREATURES show - don't miss the same. Also, you will thrill in TRAM RIDE at Night safari."
,,expect long cues,1.0,,"To be honest we never actually got in to see the night safari. Having purchased a Singapore pass from Duck and Hippo which gave us supposedly priority access to 3 attractions of our choosing from a list of 10 top, we lined up at Suntec city to board a transfer bus. The bus was 15 mins late [were told to be early as bus always leaves on time] and we had already spent 25 mins standing in this cue before boarding [ uncomfortable for a couple pushing 60 ] When we arrived at the zoo, 5 mins before a 7pm opening, time the cue was, without exaggerating, approx 200 meters long ,stretching all the way down to the taxi drop off point. We got in the cue, as signage to take an alternative was non existing. The cue eventually starting moving at 7pm and we spent the next 35 mins inching forward to the entry gates. On arrival at said gates expecting easy access with our Singapore pass [ looks just like a credit card complete with chip] we were greeted by confusion by the staff member when presenting the pass? After 2 more colleagues were called over to examine the pass we were informed that we had to redeem them at the ticket office and re-join the cue! { apparently this is written in one of the brochures in fine print somewhere, we were later informed- so much for priority access!!] By this stage we were totally over the long cues and thousands of people and grabbed a cab back to our hotel at a cost of S$41. The taxi driver informed us that it was Chinese school holidays and the crowds were worse than usual, which would have been handy advice when we were purchasing the Pass!! Considering we had been wanting to visit the Night Safari on previous visits, having experienced there wonderful zoo some years earlier, we were very disappointed with the outcome, which frankly ruined our evening.!! So we will never know what the Night Safari is all about as I am sure we will never attempt again."
,,Excellent Safari,5.0,,"It was a unique experience. Being so close to wild animals and yet so far. You can start by walking around some of the enclosures and then catch the train to see the big cats and elephants, it's a must"
,,Escape in the dark,3.0,,"No flash allowed in the park, as most of the animals are nocturnal creature therefore they are afraid that the flash will startle the animals."
,,The Night Safari just amazing,5.0,,"The Night Safari was fascinating to see Nocturnal Animals in their habitat.
The Shows were great especially the fire eaters.
I would recommend you visit on a tour rather than on your own to avoid wating times and beat the queue and take a packed meal as the catering was only just acceptable."
,,Night Saffari,5.0,,Zoo is excellent place to visit specially for Night saffari. The tribals performance in evening is good. River saffari is also in the same area.
,,Beware The Tourist Trap,1.0,,"Taxi from the city to the zoo for the Night Safari - $30

Online purchase of tickets that can be bought at the gate for $36 - $84 + international transaction charges

Checking out the line of hundreds of people waiting to get in, finding out it will take at least 90 mins to get aboard and then getting straight back in the cab to dust another $30 - Priceless!!!

After a great morning experience with the Breakfast with the animals feeling a little bit ripped off and rorted!!!"
,,Night life,3.0,,"My expectations were to high. I forgot it was night silly hey.

The restaurant was quick and simple. The transport provided easy access throughout the entire journey. The dhow at the end was simple.

I was amazed at how 5000 people were processed in 3 hours truly amazing without a hitch well done.

I would say visit once

Paul"
,,Extraordinary Experience!,5.0,,We didn't visit the zoo during the day; we opted for the Night Safari instead. It's a unique experience whereby you visit by tram and then on foot the trails behind the exhibits. Totally different experience seeing the animals' behaviours at night. The attraction is very popular among locals and visitors. Expect long line-ups. Bring insect repellent.
,,After years of wanting to visit the Night Safari... the experience wasn't so fulfilling.,3.0,,"Our group of 6 purchased a Universal Studios Singapore and Night Safari ticket deal from Changi Recommends for around SGD100 each. We went on the Night Safari on a Sunday night having followed all the promotions and rave reviews from friends about the Night Safari.

We followed the suggested itinerary to watch the fire show and the 'Creatures of the Night' show before we boarded the tram that took us around the animal park. With two young kids in tow plus a grandma, that arrangement was enough. There was no urge from our party to walk any of the trails. Toilet facilities were good. Trails were good. Sufficient park attendants to aid visitors. No long wait if you buy your tickets in advance.

The fire breathing show was entertaining BUT I think it is done in poor taste. I would have imagined a lot more interesting spectacles than watching 3 grown men take in some inflammable liquid (likely gin!?!) and put a flaming torch in their mouth to extinguish it. Oh, the performers ask a volunteer to participate in the show if you dig that kind of stuff.

The Creatures of the Night show was very entertaining - thanks to the very loquacious and funny host. Bravo to the animals that took part in the show (and their trainers). It was a 20-minute show and probably the highlight of our evening. I totally missed the part (if it was all mentioned) where I could have found out if any of the animals at all were 'Creatures of the Night'. Maybe they should have called it 'Critters at Night' show?

When one mentions Night Safari, what I seriously expected was that I would see more nocturnal animals.

Do I dare say that this was all false advertising? This was actually literally 'Safari' at night time.

Are lions usually awake at night? What about the different deer species we saw? How about the hyenas, hippopotamus and rhinoceros? Flamingos? Yes there were quite a lot of animals but I was just left wanting to know if we were actually disturbing these creatures by turning up in the evening.

So, we paid top (Singapore) dollar to see the Night Safari and I don't think I learned much from the visit. The Creatures of the Night show host ended the performance reminding everyone to care for the environment for the sake of the animals. I seriously hope that much of the fees we paid do go for the upkeep of the park and for the animal welfare! Then I'd be happy to say it's worth it.

P.S. We had the most expensive ice scream scoops outside of Italy (away from the Spanish Steps in Roma). Rip off."
,,Singapore zoo amazing,4.0,,We visited Singapore zoo also watched shows in the evening. We took ride of a train during night. The night safari is a new experience. The after show is very interesting
,,Unique joy-filled experience,5.0,,In order to enjoy a unique experience of watching the animals during the night time. A tram that takes you around the place gives you a joy-filled ride witnessing the animals in their natural dwelling (not caged). The ride concludes with an animal show.
,,Don't wait in line for a tram; walk the trails,4.0,,"When we arrived at the Night Safari, there was a line up stretching out the door and around 400m down the road. We thought we would have a huge wait and were not looking forward to that.

However, lucky we asked an employee who advised that the line up was only to get on the tram tour. We were told we could go straight in if we were willing to walk the trails which we eagerly did. This turned out to be a great move as we could just walk around the well paved and easy paths. From my assessment, it seems that one would have to get off the tram at the various stops and walk along trails anyway to see all of the Night Safari so I don't really see any point in waiting for the tram.

In any event, we did have a great walk around the various tracks with different animals and I'm pretty sure that we got in and out while some people are waiting for trams."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"Don't be fooled by the publicity.... It has lots n lots of animals....you do get to see the lions n the tigers...but its the goats.sheep,cattle of so many breeds...which really annoy you....they have a show at night safari... Thats entertaining"
,,Book early for a great evening,4.0,,We didn't realise you had to book very early to get into the early evening slot so we had to book the 9.30 slot. That allowed us to have dinner earlier in town and the take a taxi over. When we got there there were also quite a few places to eat. They let us in at 9.15 so we could see the 9.30 show. The show was good and once it finished we took the tram around the park. Probably the easier way to see the zoo with younger and tired kids. We were done by 11. Good evening and I erecting to see all the animals awake.
,,Much improved from years ago,3.0,,"Ok for very young children. Don't expect lots nocturnal animals as the park people or marketing materials say. Fire dance or show right after the ticket booths is so-so. Needs more imagination than spitting flammable liquid to form endless balls of fire with very little rhyme and reason. Creatures of the night show is funny but can get dragging. Too much talk, too few animals and to-do. Tram ride is long drawn out and made the children (and adults) nod off. Attraction is far from city central but quite convenient to go to and from."
,,Too long waiting time!,2.0,,We entered the area around 20 and found ourselves in the end of the unbelievable queue. It took one and half hour to be boarded on minibuses. That is just too long! Why don't they sell tickets to certain time?
,,favorite of tour operators,3.0,,"I was in Singapore in april 2015. I had seen this several years back. Nothing much has changed. It is too far to go unless it is clubbed with Singapore zoo. The biggest attraction to me is seeing animals in a nocturnal setting.But, it is better to take the walks as you don't see all the animals in the bus.If you have small kids, you can give this a miss as the shows start by 7pm and finishes very late."
,,A wonderful family night out!,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our night at the night safari. We were there early enough to enjoy the food which was better than normal park food. While the lines were a bit long it was worth the wait and the fans helped keep us cool.

We did not have the time to stay and take the walking tours, but when we return it will be to make sure we walk around more. It was a great family evening!"
,,"Sad, sad elephants",1.0,,"I have only seen this zoo at night. The night time safari was recommended to me as something to do after work. But the sad looking elephants who are trained to respond to the sound of the safari truck, are too much for me to stomach."
,,Night adventures,4.0,,"We loved the safari despite the long queue outside. We went there on Sunday so the zoo was really crowded. Many came here after exploring the zoo in the day. The night safari park is across the zoo, the queue starts just in front of it. Be informed that the line can be quite long so if your kids get tired, they can play in the park near the zoo and the night safari. The safari itself was interesting though some of the animals were sleeping. The ride in the tran was smooth and thrilling. One of Tapirs walked really close to me next to the tram. Nice experience. You shouldn't miss it."
,,Just a Good Experience,3.0,,"The queue was too long and the waiting area was not comfortable.

Better to go by foot rather than by tram so you can see/read/take photo better.

I suggest not to bring infant.

Overall, it was not the best animal park in Singapore. I recommend Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park and River Zafari first before you try Night Zafari."
,,"Another must do, while visiting Singapore!!",5.0,,"We reached the venue at about 7 pm, after about an hours drive from the city ( kitchener road). It took us about an hour of wait in the queue. Tourists from across the world are there to enjoy this one of its kind experience. The tram ride is about 40 minutes and is very enjoyable. We got to watch many animals during the ride. The running commentary in the tram beautifully explains about the animals. A must do. No flash allowed for taking the pictures."
,,Ok for something to do with kids on an evening,3.0,,"Night safari at Singapore zoo. Starts at 7pm till midnight. Advised to go on an organised tour as we skipped the long queues at the entrance and to get onto the trolley buses that take you round the park. Animals were great to see (if they were co-operating). Loved being able to walk through the bat enclosures with them hanging centimetres in front of you and flying around your head. Bit of a let down for us as we have previously been to Kenya to see them all in the wild so there was no comparison, however for anyone who hasnt been on a safari, then this was a good tour. The guides on the trolley buses need to keep some of the noisy tourists quieter and enforce the no flash photography as this spoiled it for us and you see so much more animal behaviours if you are quiet. You can also walk the trails, which I would do if we ever went again as you could then spend more time observing but we were time pressed with being on a tour."
,,Experience animals at night,4.0,,"So, this caught my attention when I was flicking through the brochure that my travel agent gave me (even though I do most of my research on the internet) so I decided that I would book it (something that I generally don't do, unless there are logistical reasons that make it difficult otherwise). It turned out that it was pretty cool, since you jump on a tram (which makes the tour worth while because otherwise you will end up being stuck in line) and you travel through various habitats looking at nocturnal animals. They also have a number of walking trails if you prefer to take the longer route. At the end of the tour there was an animal show, which was also pretty cool, though the show only lasts 15 minutes."
,,Must see.,5.0,,"Well designed zoo. A joy to see animals,unfenced. You can walk the trails yourself (easy to do because the signage is very clear) or take the guided tram tour. We chose the latter because we had tickets for after 930pm entry and with a 4 yr old it was quite late.We had booked tickets weeks in advance and im glad we did because the 7pm sessions were completely sold out. Arrived at the zoo at 830pm and was allowed straight on the tram because miss 4yrs was falling asleep. Staff were very accommodating and all seemed to enjoy working there. The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke clear English. There are tours available in other languages. Will definitely go again."
,,Average,3.0,,The Night Safari is just about good. Variety of Animals but they diffcult to spot in the Dark. Creatures of The Night Show OK nothing great.
,,A well kept place,4.0,,Good place to experiance the wildlife safely. Take your tym there if someone has luv for nature as besides van ride one can have tour left over places by walking. It is adventurous.
,,A dark land away from the city lights,4.0,,"The night safari is one of few places everyone should visit when they come to Singapore. To avoid disappointment and queues do purchase your tickets online as you don't want to be queuing up for tickets. There are two types of transport method that you can use to reach the Night Safari. Either take a bus from one of designated stations or taxi. Do take note that the buses are generally empty especially for Night Safari. I took the bus!

As this is an attraction do not expect food and beverages to be cheap! If you are a little tight on cash and wish to save on some cash do eat before coming! Or you can pack some dinner into your bag! Personally i ate before coming to the Night Safari.

With your E-ticket you will need to queue up to enter the Night Safari. Generally the Night Safari queue will be very long. Therefore it is better to arrive early if possible. Do not worry as there is entertainment before entering the Night Safari! You be able to see a Thumbuakar Performance (Fire Show)!

Upon passing the gantry, you can either choose to watch the Creatures of the Night Show. It's an interactive 20-minute show that highlights the natural abilities of some of the most fascinating nocturnal animals. Alternatively you can take the tram to visit the animals. My suggestion would be to take the tram first as the animal show has many timing and intervals which you can watch. If you choose to go to the show first you would be stuck waiting for the tram for over 1 hour 30 minutes. Not desirable as you would want to make good use of your time. I regretted watching the show first then queuing up for the tram. Do also take note that the tram goes to areas that cannot be accessed via walking!

After taking the tram ride i proceeded to walk the trails. There are a total of 4 trails. Its a very good experience. One particular experience i can talk about are the bats! The bats were close-up and they are definitely harmless as they only ate fruits. For your own safety do not touch the bats! Also the elephants are awesome! Especially one particular elephant that keeps on making noises! It was quite hilarious!

By that time, there will be no meals available! Therefore it's very important to bring along a drink and some snacks with you!

Overall i left the Night Safari feeling alright! It is a great experience especially for those who haven't went to such Zoo settings before. Do enjoy your night there!"
,,Wild Life with a difference,4.0,,"One of the Must see places in Singapore. And it starts after regular business hours, so you can visit it at any day you want. But weekend have got some special activities
Don't miss the fire show at the entrance in the around 6:30 and 7:00, you can wait till other gets in and wait form the crowd to go in and you can grab some bite and enjoy the show.
I took the trail waling first till 9 PM, watched the show at 9 and them enjoyed the tram. I was able to see most of it by 11 PM.
You can take food and drinks inside, bit i don't think you need them.
It could have been better if they put more Animals which really are night animals. But it was really good and i can go for 2nd time as well."
,,DON'T BOOK A TOUR! Just go by yourself!,4.0,,"After reading the reviews about the length of queues we booked a tour on Viator - :Singapore Night Safari with optional Buffet Dinner"". I would not recommend this.

After completing our application online, we received no confirmation in the documents or via email or any communication from the tour company confirming that we would be picked up from our hotel. In fact, our concierge had to spend nearly an hour on the phone trying to get through to the phone number supplied. Eventually she gave up, rang friends in the tour industry and got an alternative number (not available online or in any documentation) to confirm our booking.

We were picked up on time via a van and taken to another venue to meet others on the tour. This was almost an hour sitting around outside in 30+ degree heat in a dirty carpark. Finally, we left for the tour and were told that it would be '25 minutes till we get there'. After another hour or more of sitting in a huge traffic jam, we finally arrived (obviously quite late) and had a rushed and pretty unsatisfactory dinner. Yes, there was plenty of food - but a limited selection and not particularly tasty.

The tour itself consisted of taking the zoo tram, as described; however the tour guide would not let us get off at any of the stops to explore the short walking trails as recommended by the tram driver. The animal show was cool. We had been told we could do 'one walking trail' at the end of the tour - actually, we walked one quarter of it and then were told to turn back by the guide.

My recommendation is don't do this tour. Go by yourself - get to the zoo right on opening time so you don't have to stand in a queue - buy your own dinner as there is plenty of food available at a much cheaper price, and take your time enjoying the zoo. We found out there were plenty of shuttle services that were available back to the city even at 10:30pm!!

PS the night zoo itself was cool! Just not the experience of the tour!"
,,A different view,5.0,,"The night Safari is well worth the trip, you see a different side of the zoo and a different perspective the animals lives. Judging by the crowds I am not alone in this and is definitely one of Singapore's musts."
,,Good for children,3.0,,"It is very informative, i would suggest if you have small children you should compulsorily visit the place. It has some fire shows, a tram ride and some animals in the dark which is not that interesting but the information shared about them is very nice."
,,A tad disappointed,3.0,,"The place is great and it has a tram ride offered to visitors visiting the park. They also have walking trails that allows us to look closer at the nocturnal animals housed in this night safari. This is my 6th visit and will always come back for more every time I visit Singapore. But this last visit has made me question whether it is worth while. It's not the fault of the staff nor is it the place, it's solely on the fact that the visitors do not know how to BEHAVE. They SPEAK LOUDLY during the tram ride AND USED FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY and disturbed the animals. Wished there were stricter enforcement. But would recommend this place always as the shows are great. A must see if you have not been to a night safari in Singapore."
,,Night safari tour,4.0,,"Excellent night. Good food, but so busy. Do it with a tour group unless you want to wait in line for hours"
,,A night zoo!,5.0,,Having been to many zoos during the day this was an entirely new approach to me. I first did the round in the train. That was very nice! You get to see all the animals in a very special way. After the train ride I walked along the trail and I thought that was even more enjoyable. Unfortunately I run out of time and could not walk most of the trail. I will have to come back to do so. I would recommend the night safari to everybody. The only weird point is that some of the animals displayed are actually animals which are also active during the day.
,,Lost its charm,3.0,,"Having been to the safari on my first trip to Singapore, 12 years back, I was amazed by the concept and the way the safari was conducted. So on my last trip, I decided to go there again and witness the same old charm. I have to admit, I was rather disappointed. There were massive queues before you could get into the tram and trail was rather boring. Just when you start to expect, the safari would get better, it ends. Better than the safari, was the fire show which was performed after the safari."
,,Great Attraction,5.0,,This place is amazing. You can watch their nocturnal animal shows start at 8PM every night. You can also tour around but you need to take their tram ride. This location is 30mins away from Singapore.
,,Overpriced for the night safari,2.0,,"It was ridiculous that when we arrived the zoo at 8:00 but they could only offer us 9:30 tickets. We had very short of time in the zoo. Although the zoo closes at 0:00, however, last bus connection was at 11:00. We had only 1.5 hrs for travelling.

Most creatures cannot be clearly seen at night. For me night safari was not a very good and worthy experience."
,,Great Family entertainment,5.0,,"We did the night Safari, it was a very good atmosphere. And the kids enjoyed the fact that all the animals were on display or could be seen from the tour tram/car. Would recommend it for a family attraction"
,,Awesome.,5.0,,"My son after this visit this said these were the best moments of his life. From the time you enter the wating area you get impressed. Have the burgers outside and take a pic with the Falcon.
The fire show is impressive. We walked the trails first. It was a lovely experience. Felt like a jungle trail and could see animals up and close.
After you done with the walk then take the tram. But dont miss the tram. The animals actually pose for you. Its too funny.
Just do this and miss the zoo and river. You ll be fine."
,,Do Night Safari instead,3.0,,Ok. We did this after Night Safari in another day and found this not too great. The only thing worth was the polar bear and white tiger. And a few rare animals. May be if we did this before the night safari the novelty factor would have been there. But the zoo is clean and well organised. Lot of walking. Most of the animals were sleeping. Its a tourist trap. Do the Night Safari and save money. But I guess thts difficult.
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"really enjoyed this experience, I don't know of many or if any zoo's around the world that offer the opportunity se see how these beautiful animals carry on about their business at night. Would thoroughly recommend."
,,Interesting attraction,4.0,,"We had bought tickets as part of a deal with the river, night safari and singapore zoo. We visited the night safari first so arrived about 5pm and firstly watched the creatures of the night show which was entertaining but not amazing. Then we had free time to roam around the safari in pitch black, well some areas were lit up more, but we'd never been to a safari or zoo at night, and was very interesting and exciting.
They do have a train that runs around the park so you don't have to walk it all, which makes a nice change at times.
If you've never done one before, I'd recommend going."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"The night safari zoo is quite good, however I been to other night safarai zoos in other countries and did find them much better, What I did like was the fact you walk around the night safari and you were able to see the animals alot better than when you are on the tram ride, It is quite a rushed night as it opens from 7pm and closed at midnight, however after around 11pm most people have left as the last bus shuttle leaves then"
,,Okay,2.0,,"This was only ""okay"". There was massive queues and not sure they were worth it. Also pretty expensive. The views of the animals were great as there are no large barriers in the way. Not a must do unless you have young kids."
,,No more than average,2.0,,"On a stop-over whilst in transit to start a cruise we did the Night Zoo excursion which comprised of transport to the Zoo, a buffet dinner and entrance to the night zoo. The buffet dinner was pretty average and nothing special. The night zoo trip on the 'train' was again average and certainly none of the trip lived up to the hype and expectations."
,,Meet the animals when they are active,5.0,,"It was great experience, the tram ride was super. Enjoyed the talk, feels like ur all alone in forest exciting. Good collection of animals. Must experience it"
,,Less than expected,3.0,,"Due to time constraint we had to go at Night Safari first and then next day to see the Zoo during day time. It was actually a mistake. If you have time, best if you can see both same day. Skip River Safari, it is a waste of time. In the Zoo you can easily spend one full day, then you can have some dinner and start Night Safari. Unfortunately for us, we could understood less than 10% of what guide was saying. I am decent English speaker and also used to ""Singlish"" but this lady was impossible! Also tour was done in a rush and we realized too late that you can walk a part of it. We started pretty late, so not so big cue. We had quite big expectations, considering good reviews from TripAdvisor and friends. If you cannot see both Zoo and Night Safari better skip it, or at least come early and take you time."
,,family trip,4.0,,"amazing place to see , lots of animals but in low light one can't see animals clearly.Otherwise beautiful place , show was quite good"
,,Best time to visit is during the night opening times,5.0,,Great experience to be performed during night time. Strange atmosphere as you're walking in the zoo amongst animals. A must do if you're in Singapore.
,,Rushed and Crowded,4.0,,I took the family on the night safari as an organised tour. The children enjoyed the experience however there was large crowds and we only managed to get in one of the shows. The tour guide was able to fast track us onto the trams which was a god send but due to the tour time constraints we found that the experience was rushed. The experience is worthwhile however the large crowds may result in you not enjoying all that the Night Safari has to offer.
,,Fun,4.0,,Enjoyed the night safari experience. Saw lots of animals from the open train as well as when walking around the zoo. A bit more signage in certain areas of the walking paths would be helpful but overall a fun night.
,,Great setup,4.0,,"Kids enjoyed a lot. Entry was little bit tiring with long que. Nicely managed overall. Lovely creatures. Nice shows. Fire show is heart throbbing. Food is ok. Rates are at higher side but ok.

Most disappointing was the fact that few people never off their flashes instead of repeated request.

Loin king was great. The real king look.
Amazing experience.

Must be in itinerary if u accompany kids.
If u are alone n night life lover, give night safari second thought as u would be late n tired for orchard tower."
,,Average,3.0,,Night Safari is usually a part of iternary if you plan your trip well in advance..I would say there are much more to offer for Singapore than Night Safari..You are strictly not allowed here for a flash photography..so at night..U wont be able to take any photos..Its a usual Safari.. Nothing extraordinary..But you have to be In queue not less than 60 minutes..Ok for one time..Can be avoided if you have less time..
,,value,5.0,,Nothing to dislike.Very surprised how many animals were there.Your on an open train and are up close to all the animals
,,Different experience..,4.0,,"Night safari is one of major attractions in Singapore and it is worth going too. We went there in the 9.30 slot which is usually crowded on weekends.

There are two shows- fire show & creatures of the night. The 2nd show is a must watch..they have planned it excellently to keep the audience engaged throughout the show. After the show, they will take you to the safari in trams. Animals are in abundance and you will enjoy a great ride with information. If interested, people can along the trails to get a closer view.
However compared to other safaris (Bannerghatta, Jim corbett), it looks a little artificial as forest has human encroachment everywhere.

Overall, worth spending time & money."
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"Night safari
Massively Overrated. If you don't set you expiation too high, you will be fine.
We waited for 1hour and 15mins for our jeep!
We were on it 25mins.
The staff were really trying to discourage you from using the tram and one member of staff was telling people the que was 2.30mins!
(Lies) and insisting you walked instead!
(I paid for the tram/jeep I'm using it)
Loads of people fell for this and @ the half way point we saw these people waiting in the queues.
I'm glad we did it and kids would like it, but just to much hype for what it is.

Here is what we saw:-
Lions = a sleep
Hippos = a sleep
Goats = eating
Goats = standing
Giraffe = only one but cool
Elephant = cool and highlight of the safari
More goats= eating
Wild dogs= asleep
Black bear= asleep
Other animals = Asleep!

However when you go you may see more...

Nothing massively wrong just not what we hoped for."
,,So awful,1.0,,"This zoo was clearly far to small for all the animals, they looked unhealthy and uncomfortable. Particularly upsetting was the sight of the too skinny big cats and the elephants in far too small enclosures. The large bull elephant was shaking its head side to side as if he had gone mad. So incredibly upsetting, please do not support this!!!"
,,A Different Experience to your Normal Zoo,4.0,,"Really good to try something different with this. We started with the walking trail as the tram lines were ridiculous when we arrived. The walking trail was hard work with two small children, and you need to adjust your expectations of what you're doing. Particularly early on, it is quite difficult to find the animals so you need to be patient. After a while, it becomes a game and you actually feel like you are on a safari, in the animals natural environment and trying to find them. More often than not you do. At about halfway through, we jumped the tram (there were no queues at this point) which was a welcome rest and provided us tour commentary which was interesting. We ran out of time to see the creatures of the night show as the kids were falling asleep by about 9:30.... but we'd seen enough by this point."
,,A unique experience,3.0,,It's a very unique experience to b in a safari with various animals in the dark. Only problem is pretty long que to catch the tram.. walking on foot is a good option too
,,Great place to kick off your holiday in Singapore..!!,4.0,,Great place to kick off your holiday in Singapore. We had an excellent tour guide who helped us in avoiding long queue for the tram ride with special passes. Make sure you see the fire show and tiger feeding which I feel are top attractions. Limited choice for food and expensive.
,,An interesting time to watch the animals,5.0,,"I have been to the zoo countless times and perhaps the heat saps the life out of the animals and me as well. In the night they look different, alert and active. Most animals we saw are so close, this being an open zoo, except for the lions ( separated by a water body ) and tigers ( behind huge glass walls ).

The narrative was well paced with stops in front of the animals where we can see them comfortably from the left and right side of the tram. After the tram ride, you can choose to walk armed with a map to revisit the animals. Lighting in the park is subdued but adequate.

The park is wildly popular with busloads of visitors waiting in queue for the tram. It will be better on a weekday night but a thinner crowd is not guaranteed."
,,Book a tour!!!!,5.0,,"Definitely book with a tour group. We did and you get priority boarding on the trams if you do. We waited 10 mins for the tram, while others waited 1 hr and half.
Tour included buffet dinner in restaurant and that was yummy. Try get there early enough so you can make one of the shows.
We saw the creature of the night show and it was worth it but it fills up fast so be there 15 mins before."
,,Night Safari Singapore,3.0,,Not rich in the type of animals kept here but the packaging of the whole experience is worth a visit. Quite a few options for food and souvenirs at the entrance are well maintained clean despite large crowds that gather in the evenings. The trams used for safari trips are well maintained and the public address is clearly audible. The animals are quite comfortable with presence of large number of humans around and go about their business inspite of them. The animal shows after the safari is a must to catch but the intake is limited so better be back early.
,,a truthful review,4.0,,the night safari was a great experience once you were on the team At $42 a head it was fairly priced. The experience once we arrived at 8pm was a short wait to buy tickets but the queue to get on the team was what cattle must experience when being hearded for skater With singaporpe's humidity and at least 3/4 kilometre of zigzag pens for an hours queuing made this an outrageous experience We were lucky as although we are both in our 70s we are fit but children and people in wheel chairs had to endure the same queuing. Was this worth the end resuly? I am not sure Is it always like this I would like to know how other people found the experience I would have walk around the zoo instead of catching the tram if I had realised beforehand what I was in for the actual trip with commentary was very good.
,,GREAT ADVENTURE & LEARNING,5.0,,"We loveeee the Night Safari.

It’s really an experience and adventure to see animals at night especially some of the Animals are really active during the night time.

There is a Bus stop nearby and also a Taxi Stand. Shouldn’t be a problem to travel to this place to and from your Hotel.

Don’t forgot to purchase those lovely Glow-in-the dark Mugs to bring back Home."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Great and a very unique experience. The walking trail takes about an hour, plus a 15-minute train ride and the night show. It's worth planning ahead and booking the tickets in advance."
,,You have to go see the night safari!!,5.0,,"Ok so I didnt know what to expect from the night safari, and we had already been to the zoo that day.
We got there around 10 because I wanted to avoid the crowds (and too many kids).
It was quiet, which was great!!
But we didnt have enough time to see everything.
They have night shows on at a few times over the night, the last one is at 10.30pm, it was very entertaining and got everyone laughing.
Last tram leaves the station at 11.30pm and the park closes at 12am.

NOTE
The night safari is basicly a zoo at night and its big, so you will need a good few hours if you want to see everything.

Theres a tram that goes around the park and its great because you can see most animals from it.
There are extras you need to get off the tram and see.
This zoo if full of all different kinds of deer.
Th elephants were good, and the lions!
All the staff were very friendly and helpful."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"Due to a few recommendations, we went to the Night Safari. We were very dissapointed. To get onto the tram, there was a queue for 90 minutes so we went on foot. Most of the animals were asleep and hidden so we didnt see anything. At 11pm, we hopped on the tram - unless you are 5 years old there is nothing enjoyable about the ride in the darkness, seing a few deers from the distance.
Unfortunately, in comparison to other Zoos, the value for Money was very poor and I wouldnt recommend to spend such an amount on this attraction."
,,A lot of waiting for zoo tram - and very noisy children,2.0,,Only go if you have much patience to wait for the trams and for noisy children. Food was actually not too bad though.
,,Novel experience of a zoo,3.0,,"We visieted for one of the ""after dark"" experiences, which appeared to be extremely popular & very busy.
Overall, a pleasant visit but didn't see a lot of animal activity (that's about as predictable as the weather so not the zoo's fault!). Shows (fire eater etc) were entertaining.
Buffet experience was poor - a lot of the advertised dishes simply weren't available or they were not being replenished, which is not acceptable.
Not a massive fan of zoo's overall but accept that they are needed for education & conservation purposes."
,,All I can say is WoW!,5.0,,We went there on same day we landed . Extremely well maintained and large variety of animals. Do not skip the Night Safari at all. Kids will be loving it like anything.
,,Better the 2nd time around,4.0,,"2nd time to come. Thought i would be bored but i realized that it was better than the 1st time.

First off if u arrive and the trams have a looong line (1 hr to 2 hrs wait) just go watch the show then walk the paths not visited by the tram (leopard trail anyone?). Serve the tram for last! Trust me your feet will thank u.

The fire show is best watched at one of the cafes. U get to seat and have front view while the rest line up for 1.5 hrs before the gates open.

If u will combine this with the other zoos i suggest just 1 or i may not last the day. Ruver safari is my preference."
,,Nice experience,3.0,,I wouldnt say the best but it is a delightful experience. They initially take you on a ride through tropical jungle in a train where you can see wildlife up close. The train passes through water as well where crocodiles go from below you. Later it is followed by a show of animals such as ferrets and other nocturnal creatures. All in all it is an enjoyable experience
,,Safari in an artificial wild!,4.0,,"Get discounted tickets through hotel. It is an enjoyable trip without a doubt as you can see the animals in their natural habitat, that too during the night - it looks and feels different. You may not get to take the best of pictures unless you have a camera with good night vision shot capability, because you can't use flash light to snap their pictures. Walk a bit, take the tram for the rest when you are tired. Loved watching the pride of Lions during the night!"
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"Very nice place, well maintained & really exciting To see so many animals roaming free in the zoo. Must visit."
,,Great Safari,4.0,,"We went here in August.Unfortunately all the earlier tickets had sold out right through August so we couldn't even get in the place until 9:30pm.We arrived by taxi about 9pm and purchased tickets then had a bite to eat at Bongos Burgers.Delicious burgers by the way!!
They had a fire show on round the other side but we couldn't get near so we never saw this.If you had an earlier ticket you would have definitely been around and caught this show.Once we got in we queued up for the tram ride through the park which takes you past the animals.This took about 30 minutes to finally get on one.Once the tram sets off it has a running commentary telling you which way to look for which animals and facts about them.I found this very interesting.It was amazing seeing elephants and lions,deer,wolves etc in their night time habitats.I took a camera but never used it as you are not allowed to use flash photography.Got lots of pics when we went to the Zoo a few days later! The only thing that marred our experience on the tram was a very rude Family.The husbands were sat in front of us and talked all the way through it and their wives and children sat behind us and the children never shut up either.These were not little children and proceeded to howl like wolves all the way through it.It got to the point where we couldn't hear the commentary and it specifically asks you to be quiet as the animals are supposed to be viewed quietly and calmly.
Aside from the noise from the human animals we enjoyed it.You can get off the tram at a couple of stops and walk round.We waited until it had done the full circle and then went off exploring on foot.We saw all sorts of animals and I think we covered it all.
It would have been much better on the earlier tickets as you would have had more time and would have also seen the fire show.As late ticket holders you only get from 9:30-12 to do everything.Maybe they should reduce the price slightly for the second influx of people,but then again it is all going towards keeping these beautiful animals."
,,Excellent Night Safari,5.0,,"All the animals showed up on cue (no mean feat I suspect) and although it was busy, with long queues, everything went smoothly. I'd recommend this to anyone with a night to spare."
,,Enjoyable Experience,5.0,,"We enjoyed our experience at the Night Safari. We purchased our tickets at a discounted price through our hotel and were given the excellent advice to take ourselves on the walking trails around the zoo on arrival, rather than queue in the very, very long lines for the tram. And excellent advice it proved to be. By the time we had explored on foot, the queues (mostly large tour groups) had dispersed and we stepped straight on to an almost empty tram for our tour. Lots of nocturnal animals to see. And yes, there were some animals that stayed hidden away but isn't that the point of allowing them to live in a natural environment rather than be tourist puppets? Would recommend the experience."
,,Easily spend 2 days here,5.0,,"I did both the night tour and had breakfast with the Orangutans. Both were easily worth the trip. If doing the night tour try and catch the later train around the area as it is a bet quieter and more of the animals are active. Even lucky to hear the Asian Wolves howling, Love the Zoo.."
,,Fantastic Zoo!!,5.0,,"I have been to some of the best zoo's in the world, but this is the best experience I have ever had, ""Night Safari"". When have you gone to the zoo at night? The animals (some very rare) are to be experienced in their natural habitat and at NIGHT. Great!!!!"
,,"No more as it used to be. It is now too crowded, with too long queue, and too noisy.",2.0,,"This Singapore Zoo by night.
The queue is endless, and with small kids, it is just unbearable. Then you get on an electrical train where comments are forecasted very loud. The trains are following one anothers. Sometimes the visitors are quiet, sometimes not and they are not briefed to be respectful of the night's silence and calm.
We were lucky enough to be at Night Safari about 10 years ago when the experience was really worth it! If you can, wait until the zoo management is improving the service. The crowd usually is not an issue to me if it is well managed and the tour organised as if it is ""exclusive"" to everyone."
,,Don't normally like zoos but enjoyed this one,5.0,,"I normally don't like zoos because I worry too much about the well being of the animals, but I think the large enclosures we were driven through on the tram were good. I liked that they talked a lot about conserving the rainforest and discouraging the exotic goods trade. I did wonder a little about how they managed to keep the animals in the lights close to the tram the whole evening.. I do hope they aren't starved all day and then fed so they have to stick around.

It is well worth planning ahead and buying the tickets in advance as it seemed there was quite the queue when I arrived. If you can, get the park entrance before 9:30pm ticket because although I had just about enough time to do the tram ride and have a quick wander around, the mad rush to get back into the city to catch the last MRTs wasn't much fun. It would have been nice to wander around on the walking trails.

There are also a lot of souvenir shops and decent restaurants without needing to enter the the park, so if you do have the after 9:30 pm entry you can get there beforehand and still have lots to do. They had some firebreathers doing a show before I headed in.

All in all well worth a visit! Something for everyone I think."
,,Unique zoo experience,3.0,,"We had great memories of this park from a previous visit 15 years ago. This time, however, it was a little different and slightly disappointing. We walked the trails rather than taking the tram thinking we would see more, but seemed to wander around in the dark without really seeing much of anything. Then we headed to the animal show and it was, by far, one of the worst shows ever seen in a zoo. However, we decided to finish the night by taking the tram around the park before leaving and had a wonderful experience. In the end, it was still worth the time to see it.....maybe not the cost!"
,,No cages,4.0,,"It was great to see the animals not in a cage. However, they were not very lively...
The tram tour is a good start. A ticket to skip the queues is well worth it. Afterwards there is a nice walking trail to see the animals at more leisurely pace."
,,Unexpected fun,5.0,,Great fun with friends a must see whilst in Singapore!!! If you have time there is a night market on the way if you are travelling by metro/tram - a real taste of Singapore
,,Poor Crowd Control,1.0,,Visited on Fri 14th Aug with my wife and son. When we arrived we joined a line that was about 200m from the entrance gate. It was so crowded that we couldn't see where to buy tickets and thought we were in the line to buy tickets. We asked an attendant about tickets and were directed to another spot. My wife and son stayed in line and I purchased the tickets. It took an hour and 15 minutes of pushing and shoving with several thousand other visitors to get to the entrance. After that we were faced with another line to get on the tram to ride around the park. We saw a sign that showed the walking paths and we opted for that. We learnt that the park was inundated with more visitors than usual due to the Singapore 50 year celebrations. The park seemed totally ill-prepared for the number of visitors. Walking around was pleasant enough and we did see a few animals but definitely not worth the hassle of getting into the place!
,,Nice but all animals from india,3.0,,Tired waiting for my number huge lines and 70% animals from india nice to be close to these animals but they need to have more option
,,Great night experience,5.0,,"This was a great experience and the animals were there to be seen. We went on a tour rather than make our own way there.
Had two advantages, not that easy to get to without a car and you get priority to get on the tram round the park.
That is really worthwhile. If the operator offers a more expensive dinner option pas it up, just do the entrance option.
We did the animal show, included in your entrance, it was ok but seen better."
,,Chaotic systems in place ruined the evening,2.0,,We visited the night safari last night and were thoruoughly upset at the organisational skills of the staff. The queuing system was atrocious whereby people were pushing in all the time and it took over 2 hours to get on the tram from queuing at ten to 7 (40 minutes before opening time). I would not have been happy to bring children to this venue due to the pushing and shoving of a variety of adults.
,,Take Mosquito Spray,4.0,,"What a brilliant way to see the animals at night. But please remember to bring your mosquito spray with you or you'll be eaten alive.

Based outside of the city but easily accessible by taxi or tour it will take about 30 mins to get to.

The cue for the tram can be massive and expect to wait a minimum of 45 mins. There is an alternative solution; book the Night Safari Tour so get a cue jump. Albeit a you'll pay a little more buy completely work it.

Don't bother taking your camera as you can't use your flash so that you don't disturb he animals.

There are also a number of walking trails, restaurants and shows to keep you busy seeing the elephants and tigers and lions."
,,Great but a shame they don't allow the Halloween celebration any more,4.0,,"This is a Singapore classic and everyone should give it a try. This is not just going around the zoo at night, this is a whole separate campus to the vanilla (and also splendid) Singapore Zoo. Ride around on road-train like trams, hopping on and off as you choose, and you can even walk trails if you prefer. Enjoy the slightly spooking feeling as light shines back out of the dimly-lit animals eyes, and wonder at the power of the predators - somehow a lion or tiger is even more scary at night.

We went first at Halloween 2011, which was huge fun with dozens of students dressed up in fancy costumes camping it up and leaping out at us adding greatly to the atmosphere: sadly in 2012 management seemed to be taken over by fundamentalist Christians who decided that this was inappropriate and cancelled the event at the last minute. Here's hoping that decision is now reversed."
,,A little bit theme park like,3.0,,"An OK experience, but it felt a bit like a theme park minus rides. Obviously it was a night safari, but the animals weren't easy to see on the tram. We did the walks after and would recommend them as we saw things much better."
,,Exciting for the kids.,4.0,,"I have been a number of times despite the distance from town, mosquitoes and long queues. It is an experience, but one more suited to childrens' expectations than adults'. This is partly because of the drawbacks mentioned, but also because some of the animals are hard to spot as the 'train' passes their habitats. If in the area you might as well visit some of the other attractions in the north of the island, such as the zoo, Kranji war memorial and wetland park."
,,A safari you will enjoy,5.0,,The safari can be enjoyed on the tour bus or by walking. You will miss a lot if you take the bus as most of the small animals are on the trail sides. But there is one set of attractions that can only be seen from the bus. So its best to use the hop on station to see the last attraction by bus.
,,amazing,5.0,,Our families enjoyed teh safari trip for the 3rd time- All other attractions and food were very good
,,Didn't fancy queueing for hours and gave it a miss,1.0,,"After purchasing tickets for adults (but not our children) in our hotel, we trekked all the way out there using the MRT and bus services. It takes a while but is not too difficult. A downside is that the last MRT is at 10:30, which limited us to going to the 7:30 safari event. We arrived at 6:50 and were completely unprepared for the queues. There must have been several thousand people queueing - the queue went all the way round the building and across a couple of side streets and still more people arrived. We were hot and tired from sight seeing all day and could not face the queues. Left on the bus before it even opened."
,,Exciting adventure,4.0,,"We had a great time at the night safari. I strongly recommend booking with a company who will pick you up from your hotel and take you through the zoo. When you're with a group you can jump the queue and avoid waiting in line. We booked the night safari with the buffet dinner and the food was good, but maybe not the best ever. I do wish they had given us a little more information about how the zoo is able to have their animals so open to everyone and keep them safe. I really didn't see any cages, or fences. Not sure if I missed them because it was so dark, but the animals were very accessible. I took the tram ride which I loved. No flash cameras are allowed, however, so don't be surprised if your pictures don't turn out. We did run out of time so I didn't get to go on any of the paths for a walk. I really wish I had gotten the opportunity to do that. I think you get a better sense of the animals and how it's set up that way. Other people who were in our group and had the opportunity to do that really enjoyed it.
The fire dancers show was really fun to watch as well."
,,DIfferent,4.0,,Been on this Safari three times. It is definitely different. It is quite hot in Singapore and so therefore it is muggy but all in all a very nice outing. My husbands favorite thing to do in SG.
,,"Much hyped, no so worth",3.0,,"As this place is famous, there will be long lines for entry tickets which will eat most of your time. To avoid this better to purchase tickets in advance in Singapore city or thru some agency. We visited on a Monday evening. Even though there was huge rush, the staff were cooperative and handled it well. Here visitors can walk or take trams. (Had to wait in long queue for trams) I didn't find this place interesting because there are no so special nocturnal animals kept here. Being an Indian, this night environment is very common for me and most of the animals I see very often in India in day light. For city grown-up kids, it may be good experience. But if you have already visited Zoo and/or if you are a village background champ, I recommend you to skip this place. You will save money also as fee is little high. ಭಾರತದ ಜನರಿಗೆ ಇಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯ. ಹಳ್ಳಿಯ ಹಿನ್ನೆಲೆಯವರಾಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಈ ಸಫಾರಿ ಅಂತಹ ವಿಶೇಷವೇನೂ ಇಲ್ಲವೆನಿಸುತ್ತದೆ."
,,Book in advance and walk first part of trail,5.0,,"Excellent evening. Loads of animals and just good family experience.
My advice would be to book and print tickets in advance (as we did) as when we arrived at around 19:45 the entrance was packed (Attraction opens at 19:30).
We took a taxi from Marina bay as four of us and no easy alternate means of transport to get to the zoo
Majority of people were queuing for the trams which take you around the safari and which means a queue of in excess of 1hour in most cases.
To avoid this, we managed to find our way over to the entrance to the Walking trail (just in front of Fire Eaters) and walked the first part of the safari without any need for queuing, Walking this part of the trail also means that you see more animals and can take your time rather being on the tram which is continually on the move.
The walking trail came to an end just before the Giraffes, but we were then able to join the trams at that point and with only around a ten minute wait as they came past with some spare seats. We still then had around 25 to 20 minutes of the tram journey (past elephants and a lot more African animals).
Finally when exiting the tram we then just had to wait a short while for the Creatures of the night show, and whilst reasonable for only a 20 minute show, would not have been a disaster if we had missed it.
The safaris as a great way to pass an evening and should not be missed"
,,Amazing for children,4.0,,"One of the most attraction in Singapore, especially for children. The night safari tour really suggestive, ok also for adults. Try it, quite expensive."
,,night safari in singapore?,4.0,,took a few customer son a night safari dinner tour....yes all of it!!! very good experience that changes form the high end expensive and unfortunately blend experience. Good time for everybody
,,A must-go-to place for all animal lovers,5.0,,"Night Safari is one of the most interesting night zoo to visit. However you will need to have the patience to see every animal at their habitat as they tend to be hiding and waiting time is sometimes required to have them coming out behind the tress/bushes in their habitat. Do look around in their habitat, between the leaves and you will probably find them hiding there. Best to catch them during feeding time as they will scramble out to get their food. Higher change of spotting these lovely animals!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,I have visited the night safari more than twice I like it that much. one advice is to go between 8-9pm as that is when the animals are fed and you can see all the animals from leopard to cheetah to the lions and tigers. the night show is also very entertaining. I will go back there again!
,,Can Barely See Most of the Animals,3.0,,"The fire-breathing performance at the entrance is a must-see, very impressive.

The night safari has 2 portions, a tram tour, and a set of walking trails.

The tram tour was relaxing. The guide provided lots of information about the animal in each enclosure that we arrived at, though half the time you can barely see the animals.

The walking trails are easy to cover. There are 4 (or 5, can't remember) of them, each takes about 15 - 25 minutes to cover, inclusive of viewing time. I preferred the walking trails as we could get closer to the animals that way. Of particular interest is the Spotted Hyena viewing gallery where the hyenas were standing next to the glass wall when we visited.

IMHO this place deserves a visit, but subsequent visits are questionable."
,,"Great, but best to go as part of an organised tour",5.0,,We had a fantastic night here. We went as part of an organised tour & think this is best given the queues to get in which we bypassed completely. It was also great to get guides knowledge on timings of the other entertainment available ie fire show & creatures of the night show. Without this I think we would have missed these & they add to the evening.
,,Night walking,3.0,,This is advertised as one of the not to be missed tourist attraction in singapore but i didnt find it much amusing as it has not much to offer. Animals are too lazy to welcome the guests and most of animals will be getting ready to sleep. We feel guilty that we are disturbing their sleep. Its better to see the animals in a zoo or in the morning rather than this night time.
,,nightsafari,4.0,,do tak this safari...very interesting experience with lots of people on the tram which moves around dimly lit zoo with no cages
,,Unique experience. Fabulous performance,5.0,,"No flash please. Follow the routes as suggested on the map. We walked first before the animal show and then took the train ride so as to avoid the long queue for the train. It felt like a almost like a jungle experience if you are willing to use your imagination :). It's just an unique way to explore and escape from the heat.
The animal show is brilliant, its a clear view from any seats so no worries about arriving just in time for the show.
Must take the train, the view when i saw the giraffe habitat is never going to be forgotten. Again. No flash please!"
,,Rushed by City Sightseeing Duck Tours,3.0,,"Headed out midweek on the first City Sightseeing bus to be greeted by HUGE queues. You have to buy your ticket before you can queue as well! Took ages to eventually catch the tram, but worth doing as it is the only way to see some of the animals. Afterwards had only just enough time to race around the trails, not stopping to take in any information boards. Made it back just in time for the penultimate City Sightseeing return bus.

Top tips: have your ticket in advance or get there early enough to buy one. Also recommend making your own way there and back.

Was worth going, but very rushed."
,,Nice experience but to recommend when you are there in the low season,4.0,,"When we went there it was really in the high season, and you had to wait for the entry about an hour. It's not a cruelty to the animals as they are night active. Just please really put your photo flashes out. For a lot of things you get fines but they should really put up fines for that as a lot of people aren't clever enough to understand what ""please no flashes"" mean. Apart from that it's a real nice thing to do."
,,an Important itinerary item in Singapore,5.0,,Singapore Zoo is a combination of nature and engineering where people can enjoy their evening with the habitat and experience the wild life in its nature
,,A bit overated. Booked through SH tours.,2.0,,"It was on the list to do when staying in Singapore. We booked at the tour desk SH Tours at our hotel V Hotel Lavender. Paid for a Singapore Zoo & Night Safari package which also priority for the Tram at the Safari. Only to be stuffed around & told by the Night Safari we had to join the queue which was already backed as far as the Singapore Zoo entrance & would take 2 hours of waiting. We ended up paying extra again for the priority seating. We had missed out on having a nice meal & the show fire show. Then on the tour around the park, due to many people & the amount of noise that it wasn't many animals to see. It only looked more like a zoo with small enclosures.
We do not recommended booking anything through SH Tours. We were really stuffed around even with another tour we had booked through them the day before. Other people of the tour bus to the zoo had issues with the tour company aswell which ruined their trip."
,,Not Your Traditional Zoo,5.0,,"A friend said that the Singapore Zoo at night, is a ""must see."" Very interesting. Great effect. Yes, you would believe that you are on a African photographic safari."
,,Singapore so night safari,5.0,,"Night safari at Singapore zoo is a must recommendation. You can experience the wildlife while you are dining and the experience is spectacular
The final touch is the last item where hyenas walking on rope past you might result in loss of beat or animals demonstrating civic sense by sorting litter to bins for recyclable or trash etc"
,,A good zoo experience,4.0,,Night safari and River Adventure at the Zoo both enjoyable experiences - great variety of animals in lovely enclosures and well interpreted / presented.
,,An Evening in the Wild,5.0,,The Night Safari is a great way to see some of the nocturnal wonders of the wild. We ventured out with Tour East and were provided with priority access to the park and to the tram ride within the park. There were huge queues (over an hour each) for the gate and the tram for those not with a tour company. The animal show at the end of the evening is also a terrific treat.
,,Great Experience.....,4.0,,"A great experience and well maintained place. The park opens at around 7 pm. Be prepared to stand in the queue for an hour or even more...first to enter the park and then to catch the tram ride. If you can walk around the park, you may choose so. We missed the Creatures of the Night show and the waiting time for the next show was around 45 minutes. Better to opt for the show first and then go around the park using the tram ride. The ride around the park is about 45 minutes, with an audio commentary on various animal enclosures. Photography using Flash cameras not allowed."
,,Buy the ticket on-line,5.0,,"Good to spend an evening time. Buy the ticket online, which is cheaper. The buses back to the city leave before midnight, the taxi is expensive after midnight. Don't forget to leave earlier to catch the last metro then. I'd recommend to use the zoo train first. You can walk then to the animals as well. Enjoy!"
,,specific,5.0,,"It is not like usual zoo, you have to wait your turn and get into the small train which go trough the zoo. if you forget you glasses - dont go. you will miss it all."
,,Night life - on and off the beaten track,4.0,,"One of Singapore's most famous attractions - justifiably so. Large zoo, with excellent animal exhibits. Main focus is getting visitors on the tram (additional $5 charge): this is great as it is a large area to travel around, and affords comfort in tropical heat. BUT, it should noted, the queues are enormous - you could expect to wait at least an hour. Don't try using the tram as a hop-on/hop-off ride, as you may not get a seat when trying to get back on.
If you go at entry time walking enables you to see many of the exhibits close, and you can go straight in, dodging the queues.
Combined with a day at the neighbouring zoo, it's a long day.
Budget for 2 adults (if having a meal) at least SGD $100.
Taxis best option for getting home. And yes, expect another long queue."
,,A different and novel experience,4.0,,"There are 2 ways to experience this attraction, 1 you can take an approx 40 min tram ride with audio guide describing the animals that we see en route. The enclosures are such that you feel they are free and can easily tread on to our path as well! The other and better way is to take the various walking trails which allows you to experience it in a closer way. But be prepared for a long walk. i could do only 2 trails as i had my kid with me.

Would suggest to first see the Creatures of the Night show and then queue up for tram ride. I missed out on the show as i first took my tram ride by the time the ride was over the show had already started. I will be back again to do the balance walking trails i missed!"
,,Has improve and can do much better!,4.0,,"Not many animals during the night hours, but the shows were entertaining. This was my second time visits, has improved comparing from my earlier trip."
,,beware the crowds,3.0,,"Crowds - beware the huge lines, around a 1000 people queuing in a small space to get on the tram rides. Spoilt the experience for me, plus the people were so noisy even when the tram was going from one enclosure to other I wondered if the poor animals got stressed as well. You are better off taking the walking trails as very few people go for them. The enclosures and animals were good and its a great concept but the huge crowd is unmanageable and ruins it"
,,Must visit during Singapore Trip.,4.0,,Scintillating wildlife can be seen in the darkness of the night on the quiet train.All the animals are free and not caged.Must visit during Singapore trip.
,,good experience,4.0,,"It was a great way to see animals in their natural habitat - very close and near. However, the queues for the Tram rides are a total killer especially if you traveling with young kids."
,,Relaxing at the Night Safari,5.0,,"It was my 3rd or 4th visit, and my 18 year old daughter's 3rd, having visited twice before when she was in primary school. She is now already talking about a 4th trip in the near future, which says a lot about the safari experience! We wore ""anti mozzy"" patches to keep the mosquitoes at bay. The show was a bit short, but I appreciate the fact that training those wild animals to do what they can do is no mean feat, and I applaud the keepers for that. The only negative was that we had to queue for so very long to make the 9.30 pm show."
,,Should visit once,3.0,,"Well...it is not really as interesting as it sounds. However, if its first time in Singapore, you must spend an evening just for a feel for it..."
,,My 1st and last,2.0,,"It was terrible having to queue to enter the park only after 9.30pm (people would think it's due to free admission). Then we have to queue for another hour in order to watch the last show at 10.30pm. The park staff actually suggested we go for the trail by foot, which we are glad we didn't. We proceed with the tram ride after the show which lasted about 45 mins or so. After that it's almost 12 am and it ended our trip to Night Safari. Nothing much to see in the dark as the vision was bad. I rather go to the zoo in the day which we can explore by foot easily and spend the whole day there. I find it unworth to pay an exorbitant price to watch a 30 mins show and 45 mins tram ride. Won't visit for the 2nd time @ Night Safari Singapore"
,,A Night Safari Must-See!,5.0,,"This was mine and my fiancé's second time to the Night Safari and we loved it just as much the second time! I would probably advise trying to catch the ""Creatures of the Night"" show first and then getting the safari bus around because the queues were a bit hectic (people trying to push in etc.). We unfortunately missed the show this time round because of said queues. However, when we watched it last time it was amazing!! Like nothing I had ever seen before, different animals than the norm.
The safari is a bit out of the way but this is understandable as the safari set up is in the more jungle like areas of Singapore. Don't forget to bring Mosquito repellent as you will get bitten alive.
I would also advise going to walk around the different trails after as you get more close and personal to a few of the animals on the safari train trail but also a few more! The sugar gliders are very cute!"
,,A good experience but highly overrated,3.0,,"Night Safari is a night ZOO experience. There are 3 programs, the night shows, that are spectacular, the 20 minutes tram ride that visits the habitat of the animals and the walk trails. Its nice to visit the night life of the animals in dark, see them active, there are a couple of special animals as well, like the large red bats. As you enter first have a look at the shows and do the walk trails, only than join the queue waiting fro the tram. There is a huge crowd and 90% of the visitors automatically queue up for the tram ride that makes the queue 1.5 hrs long. Do not join it before 21:00 or 21:30. You can approach it with the combination of red MRT line, and changing to 138 bus, that is allcovered by your 2-3 days tourist pass."
,,Loved it,4.0,,It is really amazing but there are alot of animals that we couldn't see because of the dark the crew is very helpful the shows are very short though
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,It was an amazing experience being on the Night safari in Singapore...we could see many beautiful animals in the night light which was thrilling to the whole family.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,This was highly recommended but must say we were disappointed. Massive queues to get on the tram with people pushing in. Do the trails first and then the tram. We missed all the shows due to queues. Lack of animals other than deer of all types. Over priced food and queues for buses back to the city. 7 year old daughter queued patiently but was disappointed about the shows.
,,Reasonable,3.0,,"After a full day sightseeing I decided to head out to the night safari. After reading several reviews I was prepared for a long night queuing up. I saved plenty of time by having a pre paid ticket.
Arriving at 7:45pm I was able to see the fire show at 8pm then some good information from the guides sent me to the Creatures of the night show at 8:30pm as the tram queue was about an hour long. This show was the disappointment of the night but it did waste enough time for when it finished the tram ride line was empty. ( also due to SG50 celebration ticket holders couldn't access until 9:30)
The tram ride was informative and was what I expected of most of the animals at night( not much). Finally if you have a tourist pass you can get there by mrt and bus in about 45minutes."
,,Out of the world,5.0,,This is a must visit for anyone who visits Singapore. Out of the world experience. The puma at the night safari is scintillating and nerve-wrecking. But it's once in a life-time - so please do visit and don't count the cost.
,,Excellent night safari,5.0,,"We loved the night safari at Singapore Zoo, saw plenty of animals as they (like us) prefer the cooler night air. The later you go the better to avoid the crowds, get in for the last animal show at 9.30pm and then take the safari open tram. Make time to walk around as well (the whole zoo if you want). Plenty of refreshments, some expensive eg ice cream.
Taxi under $30 from city centre."
,,Not worth the time and money,1.0,,"Many of the animals are not night active at all. Every other regular zoo you see basically the same animals, just better."
,,Unnecessary,2.0,,"You can see different types of animals in their natural areas if only you are tall and have sharp eyes. It is night safari so everywhere is very dark and it is forbidden to use flash. You can't see most of the animals because of the dark and crowded.

The place is very big and dark so be careful with your children.

But the fire show at the beginning is good. They take one of the guests to stage and make the half of the show together. It is near a open restaurant. The show begins at 21.00 so you can buy your food or drink and sit near the show stage so you can watch the show comfortably.

In the show area, there are places to eat and also souvenir shops.

I don't think it is a must. You can visit more interesting places. But if you want, take your chance. :)"
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"The night Safari was way netter than expected. Book online to pass the Ticket cue (and get a 10% discount). The Safari is done as a Tram Ride. The Tram cue was approx 45min (9pm). The staff was very friendly. The ride itself is a really great experience. You See animals like lions, Asien bears and many others just in front of you. Beware: some animals piss towards the tram. The guy in front of us had the honor to be the chosen one. Lucky us! After the ride we had dinner at the restaurant. We had deep fried duck which was suprisingly Excellent."
,,Surreal Jungle experience,4.0,,"Its a place where adults too become kids. Amazing animals and the experience at night seems to be so surreal. A must visit place in Singapore with family, friends and of course the KIDS ."
,,Fantastic Zoo,4.0,,We recently visited here with a toddler and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Zoo is fantastic and the tram ride gives excellent access and views of the wide range of animals. There are a number of organised tours to collect you for the Zoo but we got there and back relatively inexpensively by taxi from our hotel. I would advise getting there before the park opens at 7.30pm as it's incredibly busy and we queued for an hour even though we arrived at opening time. Well worth a visit!
,,Really enjoyable but expect to queue!,4.0,,"The night safari was a really good night out and not overly expensive (unless you decide to buy souvenirs, eat in the restaurants etc.). My wife has been twice, we went together on a Saturday night and the queues were extensive meaning we had to wait for about an hour to get on the safari, however when she went in the middle of the week queues were far less and getting onto the safari/ into the show was much easier."
,,Big build up,3.0,,"As all our international visitors have read this is a must do in Singapore we felt we should visit.
Massive queues, expensive tickets and huge hype, led to high expectations which sadly were not met. An ok visit, but there are many better ways to spend an evening in Singapore to our minds!"
,,Best way to spend your evening!,5.0,,"What an awesome thing to do! We arrived in Singapore early morning and slept until the Night Safari opened. What a fantastic way to start our vacation! There were fire dancers as we entered the park, and then choices of shows or the hop-on-hop-off trolley ride. We couldn't have had a better experience. Will return as often as possible!"
,,A looooong wait!,3.0,,A really unique experience that we are glad we did....BUT the wait and queue was about 1.5 hrs to get on the tour 'train'. Long snaking queues at hot night temperatures so take plenty of water and patience
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"We were disappointed with the Night Safari as we had to wait 1 & 1/2 hours to get on the tram, which we didn't do. We instead walked on the trails which were excellent. We saw the animals easily. We eventually got on part of the tram ride by catching it at a station near the giraffe (the wait was 10 min here). We realised that we had a better view of the animals by walking as the tram goes quickly past each enclosure & if the animals aren't near the tram track you can't see them. The Creatures of the Night performance was excellent - make sure you see that! We had spent six hours at the zoo during the day - we had planned to do the two zoos on different days before we realised that the zoo is 1 & 1/2 hours away from the city on public transport. Fortunately you can catch a bus directly to the city from the zoo at night that only takes 30 mins, & is $3 per person. They drop off at or near most hotels."
,,No organisation at all - total bedlam.,2.0,,"We arrived there on the evening before a public holiday and had bought our ticket hours before. It was absolute bedlam and no organisation at all to enter the venue. Whole tour groups just pushed into the lines and we queued for around an hour. Then there was AT LEAST an hours queue after that to get on the trains for the tour around the park at night. All we managed to do was to see a short show that was very nice (Creatures of the Night) and walk through the walking tracks. Even the walking tracks were packed. We were very dissapointed that non-one was controlling the crowd. There is no way that anyone with a disability could have managed in the crowd. If you go, I would only go Monday-Friday when there are no holidays. It was like being in a pub that had a licence for 100 people and they were trying to get 2000 people into it. They just kept selling tickets with no regard for if they could provide any of the services to people."
,,Slightly underwhelming and big queues. Great conservation efforts,3.0,,"We came here on our first night in Singapore and were met with incredibly long queues. First, queues to get tickets (luckily our local friend had purchased them for us at a cheaper rate), then queues to get on the train, and queues to attend the Creatures of the Night show. I would recommend that the zoo looks into making bookings for these attractions so that people don't pay to enter and then not have the opportunity to attend the show or the train. This would also keep the queues to a minimal. Would not bring kids or the elderly to stand in 3 long queues in the heat.

The Creatures of the Night show was slightly underwhelming (I remembered it to be much more interactive and exciting when I came previously). Perhaps the animals were having a bad day which is understandable, although it would be good to have contingencies.

The train ride was fun and exciting and getting to see the animals from the comfort of the train and not having to walk excessive amounts was great.

The zoo's focus on conservation efforts is amazing and the whole experience was quite educational for the kids.

I would recommend bringing insect repellent and perhaps coming during the day to watch the shows also!"
,,Simply the best zoo ive visited but do the night tour!!!,5.0,,Theres a reason its in the top five zoos in the world. Just book a night tour and youll see why. We took a train walked and tookna bus to get there and it was all worth it!
,,"Interesting place, but not spectacular",3.0,,"This place is pretty much what the reviews say about it, and most things are true. Yes, it's really dark and your photos will be crap. Yes, there are a lot of people, but if you pick your time correctly, you might get lucky (we went on a Sunday night, so the lines were very short: 0mins to get in the front gate, 10-15mins for the show, and about 10-15 mins for the tram).

The show is really good, you must see it!
The tram is good to get places, but horrible for the sections you most need it: namely the areas of the park accessible only by tram. It doesn't stop, it only slows down at areas near animals so your photos will be even blurrier because you're still moving. At least if you stop moving, you have a chance at getting a half-decent shot at a moving animal at night. But if you are moving as well, then it's game over. Why they don't drive faster and stop more is beyond me.

It does take a long time to walk around to the various places, so you really do need to bank on 3-4 hours there to see everything, including waiting inline for the show and the trams."
,,Nice park with interesting animals,4.0,,The creature of the night show was good. It was very crowded. The tram ride was good but did not allow for good photos. Be sure to have time to walk the trails.
,,Not Worth,1.0,,"People rate it as a best attraction on forums but believe me Zoo visit at night is not at all fun. They will make you wait for hours for the ride. They will take you in a slow moving open van from where you can see the animals, birds and they are not caged. The lighting is poor. And flash light photography is also prohibited.You can skip this spot if you are running out of time and visit other attractions in Singapore."
,,"Night Safari, singapore",2.0,,"We visited straight after the Singapore Zoo closed then waited until the Night Safari opened - that's what most people do. But then we had to wait for over 30 mins for the gates to open and then step back for a sea of people to jostle to get inside the Safari. It was madness. The wait to enter extended to over an hour and then the tram ride waiting time was another hour. The Safari staff said this was a regular feature. No place for the younger ones to sit while waiting for the tram. The fans too were limited and the hot humid weather made things worse.

The fire dancers show before the park opening was one of the best I have seen and the wonderful tram ride with the running commentary somewhat made up for the terrible waiting times.

So you need to think twice before going with small children."
,,Pitch black with ques,1.0,,"For 42 S$ prepare to wait...wait and maybe see something. Considering that this is a limited (in time available and number of animals) version of the zoo the price is high... what you get for it is long waiting for the tram or the show. The other option is to take a walk and see the somewhat limited display on your own pace and feet.
If you think you can make some nice photos you are sadly mistaken as it is poorly lit (it is a night safary) so you will end up taking black pics. Additional annoyment, besides ques, are or the loud children, who get overly annoyed with waiting or excited to see an animal. I was also disappointed to to have seen a couple of the animals on the trail: how does a 2 tonne rhino hide itself in 100 sqm, it's beyond me?!
Definitely not fun. I recommend going to the proper Zoo during daytime: better pictures, more time, and lower price."
,,Night Visit,4.0,,"We went on the night time visit. it was rather a cheap night. The wait till the trip takes place is rather well set up. There was plenty of stalls bars to keep you entertained till dark. They also put on a very good fire dancers show just piror to the gates open to the train. These blokes would have to be some of the best i have seen, and also got the folks watching involved well done.Anyway once shows over the gates open and you line up to get on board the train. Which then takes you around the park where you see the animals in there natural enviroment night time feeding or playing. There are a large number of animals in this part of zoo, and the guide was well upto the play on these animals and habits. There was places that you can get off & walk around if you wished too.It was rather strange felling on the train as you can not really see fences or such to keep animals back & in fact some ares there was not any sot of fence, just a trench. Only down side was these night time feeders and people were asked not to use flash cameras, and hey some just dont take notice.I feel that the guide should of put the off the train(thats if they were able to understand english).Anyway good night and plenty to see.You can make a day out of this place, with adventure park water side and also normal zoo to look at. Be prepared for long waits as there are alot of people at these places"
,,Get there early and take the walking tour to Trolley pickup point number 3,4.0,,"This place is extremely popular so try to avoid the main lines lining up for Trolley rides.
They should provide more trolleys or limit numbers because at 10 PM there were hundreds lined up waiting for a ride. Their animal show was good but the last one was at 9.30 so many have missed seeing it the place was so full."
,,Good for kids !!,4.0,,"my kids love it and the experience was enjoyable , the park designed in very clavier way and professional to make you see all the activity while you are setting on rides !!"
,,Tooooo busy,2.0,,"I'm sure this is a great place but we arrived at 5.30pm when the Singapore Zoo closed then waited until the night safari opened at 7.00pm, then had to wait in the biggest queue ever for another 25 mins just to get in the gate, then there was a sign saying a 30 min wait for the tram. But we could not even join the queue as we could not find the end. After waiting for nearly 3 hours we decided to go on the walks around the park, some very bad smelling enclosures and not many animals to see. A real let down, if you are willing to wait 4 hours it might be great. No good for taking photos either."
,,Night Safari Singapore Zoo,3.0,,"No doubt the Zoo is a lovely place however, our experience of the Night Safari wasn't positive. We queued along with thousands of people winding our way through ropes to follow directions to the Tram which took 2 hours, before we simply gave up. I would recommend that parents with small children and prams reconsider the Night Safari. Some of the people in the queue were quite aggressive which made it unpleasant."
,,Fun Zoo Tour,4.0,,"Fun excursion to do one time and experience all the animals at night from the comfort of a small tram. Good for couples, groups and families."
,,"Children will love it, especially the water play area.",5.0,,"Awesome, awesome place. Very child friendly and night safari a must see. Just make sure you take the mozzie repellent at night time."
,,Super fun to watch junglelife at night,5.0,,It's also one thing u do t want to miss! Though u see Indian buffalos pigs tiger there but the view and ambience is great
,,Wonderful way to spend an evening,5.0,,"This is a lovely way to spend an evening. I visited on my own but it would be very romantic to go with a partner.

Don't be put off by the huge entry queues, they move pretty quickly. One tip, everyone heads for the train when they get in, which means more queuing. I walked the first part, which was magical and not at all busy. I then took the train for the rest of it when there was no queue.

I spent about three hours there. There are private coaches waiting to take you back to Singapore at the end for a very reasonable price, which are much quicker than the public buses."
,,Enjoyable trip,4.0,,I recommend to start by a walk through and then to ride the train. Don't miss the fire show nor the animals show.
,,Lines are too long with a lot of disrespectful guests,3.0,,"Considering that Singapore is a multicultural country with many people visiting every day, they should think about making this experience more automated. The night tram was good, the shows I didn't get to see because the kids beside me with their obnoxious parents ruined that experience. This decreased the value of the experience so it was not worth the cost. Also, a lot of mosquitos."
,,Great place for families,5.0,,"Night safari was a great experience, but I would recommend for tourists to go on a weekday so that you can avoid long lines. The tram ride was very enjoyable and nice but I would also recommend the walking trails because you get a more close up look on the animals.
Also great gift shops and dining."
,,Very Busy but worth the wait,4.0,,"This is a great place to see animals after dark, although its very busy at weekends. You can walk or get the tram around the park and I would suggest doing both as the tram goes into places you can not walk around. Most animals are awake unlike at a daytime zoo. A great experience for kids."
,,worth a visit with the family,4.0,,"normally i do not like zoos having lived in africa for a long time, however on recommendation we went to the singapore zoo and night drive. the zoo was not what i expected and does a lot of work with breeding and conservation work to improve the sustainability of the different rare animals. it would be nice to think that this is also a
happening across other zoos and that one day more animals could be returned to the wild. if you have time the night drives are worth doing"
,,Extraordinary Zoo,4.0,,"What I liked most in the zoo is you never know what animals to see in the dark. But the ride is just for 15 to 20 minutes. Whereas for the trails, it depends on how fast you walk."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"We reached late and missed the animal show.We went straight to tram and there were no Que.The tram was only half filled. We had a comfortable ride. The dim lighting and cool atmosphere added to the joy of the ride. The animals were not very active, which may be due to the training given to them from the safety point of view. We have seen safari at Canada, where the animals come upto our cars and touch the windscreen/window glass of the car.Those who have experienced that kind of safari would feel let down. But on its own, this is not a bad experience.
There are several eating joints at the parks, which serve different kinds of food,including Indian food with vegetarian choice. Had we known this before hand ,it would have saved us a lot of trouble."
,,Must do the night Safari,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the night safari. Don't go at your own, because huge line. Take the package from any good tour operator, you will get easy access. Good restaurants there to have dinner after night safari."
,,This is a zoo with trained animals not a safari,1.0,,"The main issue with the night safari is that is it not a safari but a zoo. The main reason we visited is because the name 'safari' suggests relatively free roaming animals, but this is not the case. The animals are in very small enclosures cleverly made to look bigger with the use of thin wire fences that you can barely see. More disturbing then this is the behaviour of the animals, at first it seems incredibly lucky that you get so close to the animals and that they seem to always be looking in the direction of the tram and walking around, but at a closer look this is in fact because many of the animals (specifically the lions, elephants and tapir) are trained to do this.

The elephants all stood facing towards us and one of them performed the same waving/swaying gesture 4 times in a row as the tram passed. It was obvious that they were not behaving in a natural way.

After the tram tour we spent a long time at the lion viewing platform, at first we couldn't spot the lions at all which was strange because they were so active during the tram tour but we quickly noticed that each time the tram passed the lion came down from it's hiding place and did a loop of its small enclosure, then returned back to its retreat. This was not a coincidence, the lion did it 3 times in a row as the tram passed.

Finally during our tour the tapir walked right alongside the tram which seemed very lucky to us at the time, but after we left we read comments online and it seems that almost everyone else has had the same experience.

The other issue we had with the park was that the walking paths are very poorly lit and when we were there (around 10pm on a Friday) it was very quiet and quite eerie, there was nobody else around and sometimes quite a long walk between enclosures. A bit scary when you can hear wolves/lions/boars!!!"
,,must for kids,4.0,,"Good concept , you have the choice of either go walking or take the tram, however for adults without this one can be missed...."
,,Wait wait wait oh you're a weterner wait longer,2.0,,"Despite booking and having a ticket still had to queue for over an hour and just when we thought we were about to get on all Weterners we're directed into a queue and had to wait while all Asians we're escorted through. In all nearly two hours waiting for a 30 minute ""safari"". Safari includes a very small number of animals. Would not recommend this experience."
,,Night Safarri,5.0,,Singapore night Safarri is a must especially if you have kids. Great night out and the Zoo is fantastic of an evening .
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We booked this together with the zoo but visited on a different day. What a fabulous experience. We arrived at around 7 and joined the queue but once the gates opened we got in pretty quickly. As advised previously we did the 4 walking trails first and then the tram ride to see the animals which you don't see on the walking trails. Doing the tram ride last meant we didn't have to wait in the queue for it for very long at all. We got to see all the main animals -elephants, tiger, lion, bear, giraffe etc up close which was fabulous. The guide we had on the tram was very informative and we learnt a lot. The walking trails were very easy to navigate and you could spend as much time as you wanted on each on. Would recommend this to everyone!"
,,"Good animal selection, well maintained park and animal welfare.",4.0,,A very well kept Zoo. Animal welfare is good which always is a prime concern when choosing to visit a zoo. The night Safari is over priced and can be a waste of time if you take the tour bus as the queues are immense snaking for miles. Better walking the park route if you want to see more.
,,excellent sights but to many people packed in,3.0,,"we waited 55 minutes in a line of 500+ to get on the safari shuttle after the animal show, I am afraid the hosts were allowing far too many people into the night safari, people were not happy about the wait and the organisers were in a fluster to sort all shuttle, tempers were on edge and still they kept letting more and more people in.

we arrived night safari at 7.00pm, I estimate 1000+ people waiting, we did not get on shuttle to 8.50pm, the shuttle took about 40 minutes and the tour was excellent, plenty of animals to see if their natural habitat with good commentary.

This is a great tour but we missed our return transport at 9.20pm as we had no idea how long the shuttle ride was, we were not paying over $150 for the family to miss the night safari, thank goodness the double decker bus saved us with tickets at $3 each as the tour operator was long gone and people were not happy."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,This open plan zoo is fantastic and is clearly meant to be in the top 25 zoos in the world! I went at night and went on the night safari and thought it was brilliant. The animals basically roamed around at their own will and there was a part of the path that had particularly crazy bats! I was on a study tour with uni at the time and have vowed to come back! I did not see in the day time -
,,Night safari,4.0,,"We bought tickets for the night safari and were encouraged to come back to spend the whole day at the zoo instead of just doing the night safari. We chose to stay and only see the nighttime safari, because the zoo is not exactly easy to get to, especially when you don't have a whole day free. We saw many different animals, some sleeping, some awake, it was really quite cool. I would recommend it even though it was a little pricey."
,,Night Safari a must see place.,4.0,,"Singapore Night Safari a wonderful place , you can watch wild animals in open aria , a must see place in Singapore ."
,,Upclose and Personal!,5.0,,"What an excellent attraction. Not too expensive, 40SD per adult, 19SD per senior. The animals are not caged, fenced or baricaded- although I suspect they are either very well fed or sedated since they do not scatter or run away when the train rolls right past them . Animals are literally a few feet or yards away, including Lions, bears, all sorts of deer type animals, girraffes, you name it. However, the tigers are behind glass. You have the option of walking through the park or taking the train. I recommend the train because it's a guided tour, its relaxing and becuase it's yucky hot and humid ALL THE TIME in Singapore, so you'll enjoy not have to exercise your way through the park in the heat. Safari takes about an hour, and of course there's the predicable tourist shops for souveneirs and such , and you can grab a bite to eat at the grill restaurant. Not a bad way to spend the night!"
,,Spend half your life in the queue !!,3.0,,"My best advice is to get there early and don't be fooled into eating at one of the restaurants first as not only are they hugely expensive and you may never get a table but whilst you're doing this, all of the smarter people are already lining up......all tge way out onto the road....and then when you do queue expect to be tgere for 2 and a half hours.I am serious.We were almost delirious by the time we got in-it was unbelievable. Ok so we finally get on our tram and set off and the guide talks so loud and nonstop t by e entire time that you actually miss the animals vocalising.Well he told us they were and whilst we were all so keen to also hear this it was impossible with him on his megaphone. The tram would putt putt along slowly and as it got near the animals and I wasnt imagining it as others were saying it but it would speed up so often they were just a blur as we went past which was so disappointing as we missed so much. The whole trip takes about 15 minutes but I would highly recommend not taking the tram with the hoardes and instead walking which looked fantastic and you can meander in your own time.It was alot of money for what we got and the time spent queuing up certainly not worth it."
,,One unforgettable night,5.0,,"Tired after the city tour for the day, I took a quick nap and got in my running shoes to visit the next destination on my list which was none other than the Night Safari in Singapore. The guide warned us to remain quiet as we watched the nocturnal animals and birds at the night safari. It was actually a lifetime experience as the route of our rail bus cut through the jungle trails. Anybosy fond of wildlife must visit this place."
,,Best safari experience in world,4.0,,"If been to so many safari park even usa, came here second time after 12 years , this is the beat safari experience we had with kids , live shows in evening with animals in open theatre. Kids love it , you can see all animals in open park with lights on them from top. Truly amazing... Must visit...."
,,"Night zoo, a must see singles, couples and families!",5.0,,"No barriers or fences to the animals (except the tigers), they are well fed and quite lethargic so no worries about the lions, bears, hippos, rhinos, and bison being literally 50 feet away! Awesome."
,,Great night,5.0,,"After reading reviews of the huge lines I was hesitant to go, but we got there later and had no waits at all. Did the animal encounter first 8.30 show, then straight onto the the tram. This then left enough time for the walking trails at the end of the night. It is easier to get a taxi to the zoo and not that expensive. Approx $18 from Orchard road. Also if you have a singapore airlines boarding pass, you get a discount."
,,A Day's Experience!,5.0,,Singapore Zoo is great - set aside the time to see all the different parts. I will especially remember the wolves howling at the night zoo - awesome.
,,Zoo,3.0,,I bought tickets to the night safari we followed advice from website got there 6:30 PMIs was not just crowded it was CROWDED the line of people to enter just had no end as coaches of tourists kept arriving . If you don't mind this kind of thing you'll be fine it just wasn't for us
,,A night to remember!,5.0,,"People generally say that 'zoos' are for kids but this is not the case when you go to the Singapore Night Safari. It will bring out the child in you.
The speciality of the Night Safari is that the animals are not in a cage. They are all in the open within a surrounding as one would find in a jungle, doing what they do in the wild. The park is specially designed in a way that the lighting is just as bright as the full moon, and since the animals are used to that, they are awake and active.
There is a path way for the visitors to make there way through and also a toy train which helps the visitors explore the other parts of the safari.
No flashy photography is allowed keeping in mind the well-being of the animals and the show at the end is just like the icing on the cake.
It is just worth a visit!"
,,The Nocturnal Zoo- The Night Safari,5.0,,"As the name suggests, this is the world's first nocturnal zoo located in Singapore which houses over 2500 animals of which 38% are threatened species.The best part is that unlike other zoos, this one is open at night. The zoo can be explored either on foot or by tram. Also there are cultural performances such as the tribal dances, fire eating displays. Food and Beverage outlets include the Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant, Bongo Burgers and Casa Italia."
,,It's not worth it,1.0,,"How to get there by public transport: Take MRT red line to Ang Mo Kio station and then interchange to bus no 138

We went to singapore on backpack but we were appealed when we read the reviews from other visitors. So we set aside our 38 dollars and went there hoping that what we will be seeing are totally what others have described. It didn't really goes up to our expectation; it was so crowded, the queue was very long and we had to wait for 30 minutes before we managed to get into the shuttle. The visit itself wasn't really that enjoyable; some of the animals couldn't be seen as they will not be on the spotlight to show themseves all the time and they showed too many kinds of deers and cows that at the end of the visit I feel like wanting to sleep. The visit was only for about 30 minutes and then it ends just like that. They also proposed 2 sessions of night show but if you are stranded in the queue you might not be able to watch the show.

In my opinion this visit is meant for those who haven't seen animals up closer and kids (for educational reasons).

Visited in June 2015."
,,Big Crowds but worth it,4.0,,"Visited the Night Zoo twice May 2013 & December 2014, but time had huge line ups for Safari Train, but worth the bother. I use a Luggie Travel Scooter & they were happy to accommodate this"
,,Animals come out at night!,5.0,,Started our visit at the entrance for the fire-breathers show followed by the excellent night show and then the tram tours. It was a very educational and relaxing experience and before we know it whether you take the tram or walk the zoo. Open enclosure-styled exhibits similar to singapore zoo. Great night out
,,Tourist trap of the worst kind,2.0,,"I've lived in Singapore for five years and visited Singapore for many years before moving here. I used to enjoy going to or taking guests to the Night Safari, especially if they had younger kids who would enjoy the idea of watching animals in a different and unique setting.

I hadn't visited the Night Safari in some time before I took guests just a few nights ago and I was shocked by the dreadful experience of my last visit.

Entrance fees to the Night Safari for a family of four were shockingly high (S$140 for a family of four) considering that most of the evening was spent queuing to get on the tram to take us round the park. The queues for the tram (around 45 minutes - and that was a quiet night compared to previous visits) were chaotic. There was no sense of organisation and park staff just didn't seem to care...literally going about their jobs packing and stacking people onto trams in a ""get on and get out of my face"" kind of way. Really not a proud moment for Singapore.

The tram tour is no longer a personally guided tour but a automated tour which did not work in sync with the location of the tram.

Forget trying to get to the show...both shows we tried to see (queuing again for 20 minutes each time) were full.

Oh and if you want any food or beverage...prepare to mortgage your house. Absolutely eye watering prices (at least 4-5 times the price on the street). Well they've got you trapped so they might as well milk you for all of you've got!

They say true capitalism is greed...well the Night Safari is a truly capitalist enterprise! Greed over enjoyment...waste of money and time..."
,,night safari,2.0,,"idk why people liked it, but for me, it's not really fun & boring maybe(?) get ready for mosquito attack! lol. the show not really good too."
,,A bit rushed but worth it,4.0,,"Great to see the animals active at night. Very different to the daytime. Unfortunately, on our tour, it seemed that we were rushed through a bit as would have loved to take our time walking through the park. Big crowds and lines, so prepare and plan ahead! Buffet dinner included on tour was nice"
,,See the animals at night,5.0,,We did the night time safari You feel like you can reach out and touch the animals but they seem oblivious to you being there Fantastic !!!!!
,,Great Night!,5.0,,"If you can't visit the zoo throughout the day this is great way to see the animals, as its not as hot and also you get a guided tour on the tram. Also the shows are fantastic! great fun"
,,How to avoid an unhappy visit to Night Safari......,4.0,,"For most popular attractions anywhere , its very normal to have big crowds, long queues, long wait to enjoy the many facilities/dining & so forth. Unfortunately, we can't change these situations.

But knowing how & what to do before visiting can positively help one to better enjoy these crowded attractions.

Consider these minor preparations & adjustments to enhance a more fun & joyful visit to Night Safari.

1. Book your tickets online to avoid long queues & waste of time at onsite ticketing. If you are lucky, may get special promotional prices or packages. Avoid weekends & holidays.

2. Night Safari opens at 7.30pm & closes at 12mn. Go after 9pm as less crowded then - to avoid the initial coach-loads of huge crowd. You still have 3 hours- more than enough time for a good visit.

The animals are nocturnal- they get naturally more active as the night progresses. Come too early & some may still be sleeping.

No worries about taking cabs back on late nights as Singapore is very safe.

3. The last thing you need are enthusiastic but tired kids. Put your kids on an afternoon nap so they won't be tired for the night visit.

4. Mosquitoes are abundant in forested areas, especially in hot & humid tropical climates. Put on insect repellants or bring a mosquito bite cream. The itchiness & discomfort from bites will spoil your visit.

5. Wear cool clothings & comfortable shoes. You don't want a sore feet nor feel too uncomfortably sweaty with much outdoor walking to do.

Bring enough water as one gets thirsty quickly with much walking in this weather.

6. Avoid the trams unless physically you needed it. The queues are usually quite very long. Take the Walking Trails instead. Can't see much from a moving tram. Nothing beats a close up view of the beautiful animals.

We have definitely enjoyed the visit better with these preparations/adjustments. Hope it helps for others too."
,,A Unique Experience,4.0,,"The Night Safari is an interesting place to visit at night, a rather different take on ""night-life"" for those who are already sick of the usual partying and getting drunk, and for families with children. The tram ride is a great way to get around, especially if you're already tired from the day's activities. (The queue can get pretty long though!) The Creatures of the Night show was entertaining and educational at the same time, and children-friendly! Food and gifts can be pricey, but no one said you have to dine/shop there! Overall a unique attraction and a good way to spend a night in Singapore!"
,,Singapore Night Safari,5.0,,"It is perhaps the world's first night safari for nocturnal animals. To reach the place, you need to take the MRT to Ang Mo Kio and then board the Bus No. 138 to reach the venue, which is the terminus. Please remember, that after the visitation to the night safari, you may not be able to get back to the bus no 138, so there would be SGD 3 per person shuttle rides back to city center destinations like Orchard Road or Little India from where you can get connected by the MRT. Inside the park remember not to miss the fiery Thumbuakar performance and the Creatures of the Night show. Then take the leisurely tram ride as you get the multi - sensory experience of the wild in the moon - lit setting. And please do not forget to drop in at the Ulu - Ulu Safari Restaurant at the end of the show."
,,A nice change for your vacation plans,3.0,,"It was the first time that i went on a night safari, so it was quite a new experience. It was hard to see though obviously due to darkness but well we saw some big cats so it was alright. I think it's better if they reduce the price a little if possible to attract more crowd for a worthy experience, If you don't have huge plans for the night and got some cash in your pocket, it's worth a visit."
,,Nature by night,5.0,,"An entirely different perspective of animals in their habitat by night.
Nocturnal animals all very active, oblivious of people in tram cars travelling through the park. Conditions for animals first class, most enjoyable evening.An added bonus was a buffet dinner, prior to tram ride.Plenty of food to tempt the fussiest of eaters"
,,An experience to remember,5.0,,What fun doing the safari at night to see the animals that are nocturnal. We enjoyed it. Only downside is trying to stay awake on the way home.
,,don't do the ride,4.0,,"The night safari is a great opportunity to see a number of animals closeup - animals that you might normally see. The fun one is the bat cage which you can walk through. Or the flying squirrels. There is a huge queue for the bus ride. Skip this and do the first half of the tour on foot. Why? Because the ride doesn't come anywhere near some of the fun animals. At the halfway point get on the ride. Why? Because the ride takes you past the majestic elephants, tigers and buffalo that you don't see from the footpaths.

My only complaint is the ride rushes past the animals - you get about a 10 second glimpse, especially if you're on the last (third) carriage."
,,Think twice..... May not be for everyone,2.0,,"In two words - endless queuing.
We must have picked the worst night to visit - first we walked 3 mins to find the end of the winding long queue. Yes one queue even for those with tickets at hand. Eventually after ONE hour we reached the gate - only to find out then - no restaurants inside the safari NOR toilets. With a five y.o that almost like 2 of the biggest challenges. Fortunately they allowed re-entry, so whilst we were queuing inside for the tram (we had NO other option - the night creature show was full and we couldnt possibly take the little one on a dark walking trail.).
So another hour later we had got on the tram - 2 hours spent on queuing and 3 re-entries going to toilets.
I am not sure this is for everyone especially the young children as the drive was very dark (so it should be) and that could be a bit scary for them.
I do feel sorry for the safari staff who were guarding at the intersection between the road and the walking trail.
Bearing in mind the safari only has an operation hours of four and a half. Spending 2 hours queuing could be unbearable."
,,longest wait ever,2.0,,We visited the night safari on the 18th July we had to wait in the heat for over 1 and a half hours we where on a tour but we still had to endure the long wait like milking cows lining up to be milked. The heat was rediculous only a few fans working. Then it took so long to get around to finally get on the tram we had no time to go on the second part of the trip as our bus was leaving 10pm sharpe. Well that was another thing we didn't get back on the bus till 10.25 because of the rediculous lines of buses. Never again complete waste of money was over tired by the time the tram ride even began.They need a way better system than that it was complete Kaos.
,,Good for smaller kids,3.0,,"We found it to be OK, but thought it was quite expensive for what it was. We were recommended this by friends, but I personally think that it appeals more to families with younger children. The food in the food court was quite expensive and my wife's chicken in her stir fry was undercooked and quite pink in the middle."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Best times to get the big cats in action is between 7pm-9pm.
Pay attention to the feeding times as big cats can be very sleepy any other times..
It's tricky to time the visit with the shows available (we have been during weekend end we learned that crowd factor should be considered) we missed the show as we arrived 10:30pm as been advised by staff but it seemed too many visitors received
same advice as show was full. Nevertheless , we enjoyed the night.
Highly recommended for jet lagged families"
,,A must-see in Singapore,5.0,,"The Night Safari is a unique experience and comes highly recommended. Take the little train or walk around and see all the nocturnal animals doing their thing. Unfortunately, some people still feel it's ok to tap on glass or use flash photography even though there are signs everywhere. Take pleasure in tapping them on the shoulder and referring them to the signs - the animals and the genuine animal-lovers will thank you."
,,Must See,5.0,,Great experience for young and old. I have been several times and enjoy it every time. Well worth the time and money
,,A waste of time and money,1.0,,"What a tourist trap! We booked transport from our hotel and were taken to a terminal at Marina Bay to pay and get on the coach for a 45 minute trip to the zoo. When we arrived there was a fire-eating performance, complete with bongo drums and banshee screams, someone’s idea of Africa (obviously had never been there), even though most of the animals were from Asia. Our ticket included priority access to the “tram” (an electric vehicle with two trailers, all with rows of bench seating), but we still had to wait more than 20 minutes to join the constant procession of trams crawling around the zoo.
Understandably, lighting is very dim, and the result is that all the animals are grey: our eyes don’t see colours in dim light. So it was very difficult to make out some of the animals. Yes, they were more active than they would have been during the day (especially in the heat and humidity of Singapore), but hardly more active than they would have been in a temperate climate.
After 45 minutes we were back at our starting point, and a repeat of the fire eating, bongo drumming and screaming. There are walking trails that allow you to see other animals, but we didn’t want to stumble around on those walks (and you can’t walk where the trams run). Going past the many and varied Asian fast food restaurants, we bought an ice cream – good - and few “snacks”- barely warm pieces of battered fish and spring rolls, disgusting - had a cup of passable coffee, browsed the souvenir shops but decided not to buy anything to remind us of the place and, at last caught the coach home.
The only photos we took were of people scrambling to get on the trams, after they had waited at least an hour (even though school holidays had finished the day before our visit).
Don’t waste your time and money."
,,This is Disney at it WORST - and I can not rate it low enough,1.0,,"Here is what happens, you wade through screaming kids (late at night) lots of lights and food vendors, to wait forever in a meandering line to get on a tram to take you on your ""safari"". Having been to Zimbabwe on Safari I can tell you it is NOTHING like Africa. The tour guide shouted in three different languages to stop the flash photography about 20 times, the screaming babies and kids never stopped - screaming that is. The entire experience was the ONE episode in an otherwise fantastic experience in SE asia. This was strongly recommended by the cruise organizer or we probably would have gone on intuition and not shown up - but unfortunately we did and we deeply, DEEPLY regret doing it - STAY away - FAR FAR away!!!!!"
,,Disappointed,1.0,,Imagine queuing for 45 minutes and so sweaty that little fans on top not helping at all and hopping on board to see if possible to see few animals at night. Not worth it.
,,NICE!!!!,5.0,,"Okay, some people don't like this zoo, coz can't see animals well and they were sleeping whlie people visited there..
But LITERALLY, it's NIGHT ZOO.
Of course animals might sleep when you visit. They are not robots or adorable dolls which are in your room. They are animal. they are alive! they need to sleep.
But i don't mean that people who got not very good memory here were wrong or something. I just want to people who will visit that place soon know before going Night Zoo. It's ""NIGHT"" and ""ZOO"". Remember!

Fortunatly when i visited the night zoo, most of animals were awake and i could see many animals at night. That was so interesting.

I don't know whether your place has a night zoo or not. But in Korea, we don't have night zoo. So.. it's more interesting to me~

A-ha, here is a tip.
When you visit Singapore, wnat to buy tickets such as Univecial , Night zoo, River safari, Singapore zoo and so on.
You can go to CHINA TOWN first, google "" SEAWHEEL TRAVEL""
(http://www.seawheel.com.sg/) here is the most famous travel agency for cheapest tickets. So you can buy tickets with good price.

(How i know that well is i am living in Singapore now KK )

And um... being a Singapore citizon, you can tour with just normal buses.
This country is really well organized transportation; MRT(subway), Buses.
Also if you stay in Central such as Bugis, Clarky, Chinatown.. something that,
you can also walk from your place to other central place.
(Download ""Singapore map"" or ""google map"" or ""maps.me"")
It's really small country you can go anywhere you want if your legs are still fine and you love walking with strong sunshine with high - moisture."
,,Come without expectations,4.0,,This place is definitely a must while in Singapore but don't expect too much as many animals are still not active by the time the place opens... Make sure you do the train ride and come in groups to have more fun. Certainly a nice place to see but it's more about the overall fun with friends.
,,Must do,5.0,,After spending a long day at the Zoo we were exhausted but had already paid to do the night safari that same night. We were planning on making an early getaway however this didn't happen and we nearly missed our bus home. This place is stunning. An amazing experience and you need a decent amount of time here to fully explore. The tram ride is enjoyable and you get to see a lot however to see even more you really need to get off and walk. The place is big and the variety of animals is impressive. A great experience and highly recommend
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Long queues but worth the wait. Tram ride is amazing, even the wild animals are kind of left open while the tram passes by. The audio tour on the tram was very nice."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,We did the night safari at Singapore zoo A very special experience The animals are so active during the night and you feel you could reach out and touch them
,,Night tour,4.0,,"We did an organised night tour of this zoo and found it amazing, first with the animals and also the thousands of people there. First we did a short walk called the Fishing Cat walk (the cat didn't co-operate ) but we did many Asian animals. Then it was time for the tram ride, being on an organised tour we got priority thank goodness as the wait for the tram was up to 1-2 hours, we only had to wait 15 minutes. The ride arranged so that it featured night animals in their natural habitat such as plain animals like Giraffes and Zebras, wetland birds and water buffalo. Lions and tigers appeared to be within touching distance from the tram, there are elephants, bears and lots deer and goats. After the 3/4 hour ride there was another animal show lasting 20 minutes showing other trained night animals such as otters who pick up rubbish and put it into the correct bin. There is a large food area with a large choice of cuisine. All in all a satisfactory visit. I believe 10,000 people visit the zoo each night. We hope to go back and see the zoo in the daytime and do the many walks."
,,night Safari a must,5.0,,"Fantastic zoo well worth the time in traffic to get there , the emtertainment that is put on was outstanding , fire show dancing and much more great night out ."
,,Night Tour,5.0,,"Really awesome night tour - highly recommend it. They have fantastic habitats for their animals as well as some roaming free within the park. It was very, very cool to see the animals at night up and about plus not quite as hot as during the day. They even have a mini hawker station there with actually decent food."
,,Super cool,5.0,,"Had so much fun here! Watched the fire show which was amazing and took the tram ride around. We walked through quite a bit of the trails, but was glad we did I the tram ride as there were some animals you could only see from the tram."
,,This zoo cares about their animals,5.0,,"Awesome zoo. Its big and well worth the money. I could pay more if the money went to the right place.. the animals.
They seem to care about the animals like no zoo i have seen before.
We came after 10.00 to not have to stand in line. Result was straight trough the enterence. Cheapest food that got us full was on the outside for 10 dollars. Water was 2 dollar everywhere. ALL Staff was wonderfull people and you meet a lot of them during a day there. Love to all of you!! If your bosses read this. You should be proud of your staff! Not many places have been blessed with this kind of staff.

Animals seem to be in good hands and the zoo is clean. Never seen so clean water in the tanks! You get realy nice photos.

The night safari was a experience!!
You need to walk and do the ride too as walking by yourself quiet in the jungle is awesome!! Try to not have other people around you. Please respect the rules about being quiet and not taking flash photos. The bat cave was super cool too! To get this close to these animals without anyone around or anything in between was by it self worth half of the ticket price for us.

The line to the night safari is madness.
Grown up people who cut in line.. like all the way to the front with their whole families while you look back and see normal people waiting way in the back of this queue that is going to take an hour to get trough. I personally feel that its sad to see parents behaving like this in a family park. I would be ashamed of myself if I was teaching my children that this was okay.
I hope the zoo fixes this with new queue systems. The employees was ashamed over the whole situation and were apolygizing to visitors for what people were doing, as this was a huge problem.

Went also on a boat on the river. It was nice but more because of the nature.. not so much animals.

The small raft ride going trough the jungle was sweet! First row get wet shoes but its singapore so they dry trough out the day.

Saw an ape who had got hold of plastic and was chewing it. Said it to the staff and they realy cared and went to action right away. There is love for the animals"
,,Night Safari is the best,4.0,,We've been to the night safari a few times in the last 5-6 years and it's very good. Can get busy and there's lots of tour buses that go. Don't forget to take mosi repellent and water...it's hot and the little buggers are everywhere.
,,Unexpected,4.0,,"We went into this skeptical, but really enjoyed ourselves! People were complaining about lighting which is absurd. It's night time and the animals are nocturnal, if it was bright then the animals would not be out and about!! Be warned, there are massive queus, and you will need mosquito repellent, and the trip out there is pretty epic; but it's completely worth it!"
,,Interesting and different,4.0,,"First time I visit a zoo at night and it was quite interesting. They said that some animals are more active at night and it must be true... You can hop on and off the little train (don't miss it!) to visit different areas. The darkness and the silence changesd for me the whole concept of a zoo. The only question is what do the do to the animals to make them stay wherever they want everytime we are close (yes, very close...).

If you come to the zoo in public bus you still can catch it back to the city when the last little train ends, thankfully!"
,,Phenomenal,5.0,,Go early to enjoy the presentation but do stay late to walk the trails of the night zoo after the crowds disperse. Quietly the animals come to life. Thrilling
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Watched the fire show and creatures of the night show then took the tram ride across the safari park. The host of the creatures of the night show was really funny and good at getting the crowd involved. The host of the tram was also funny and very informative but annoyingly the other people on our tram were very rude and talked over him for a lot of the time.

Only negatives were that the safari park is quite far away and so taxis there and back were quite expensive. Also there was quite a bit of queuing involved for boarding the tram but I guess this is to be expected for such a popular attraction"
,,Better than zoo !,4.0,,"I find night safari better than zoo because of the timings. When we roam around in zoo it's quite hot but timings for the night safari are perfect. One more thing when it is too hot even animals are either sleeping or resting at shadow places . But at night even animals roam around freely. Then tram at zoo is useless but at the time of night safari, tram goes very slowly so that you enjoy that place ."
,,Bats about bats,4.0,,"It was very crowded. We enjoyed the show at the start, the queue was still too long for the tram so we walked one of the trails. The highlight was going into the bat enclosure, they were so close!! Then we were able to hop onto a tram to see the rest of the park which was just as well as it is still hot and humid at night so not easy to walk. The paths were well lit and it did feel safe, there were also plenty of keepers around to talk about the animals."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,Overall was disappointed with the night safari as most of the animals were far away and the lighting was not very bright. Understandable to keep the natural habitat of the animals. The fire show after the safari was awesome. Carry a professional camera as no flash photography allowed.
,,Worth going but...,3.0,,The night safari is actually a separate place to the Singapore Zoo (although it's right next door). It's worth a visit but it had been built up to us by friends as an amazing experience and it wasn't really. We got a good tip to see the shows first and then go on the tram ride around the zoo last. This allowed us to avoid the long queues. There's a halfway entertaining if not predictable show starring the zoo's nocturnal animals with some amusing moments for little ones. The flame jugglers are entertaining and there's some nice walking trails. The big but is the tram ride shows the enclosures to be small. We saw animals pacing back and forth and although they were not distressed they looked like they were captive in a small area. We asked a staff member at the end of the night and he said they don't feed them while the safari is on and so because it was towards the end of the night they were getting hungry. Mmmm. Perhaps but it did seem like a lot of big animals were in a small space. We have absolutely no expertise in this area and would be happy to be set straight by others. We were still glad we went but probably wouldn't go back.
,,Amazing Night Safari,5.0,,"To begin, we would highly recommend that if you are backing this on to a day at the Zoo, you come here for dinner and not the zoo. So much better choices. Awesome light fire show to begin the night. Great variety of animals to see. Make sure you get off the tram and go for a walk. Night Safari does well to manage so many people. Hundreds there. Expect a wait to get on the tram but it's all good from there. A must do."
,,Not great.,2.0,,"Unfortunately I didn't really enjoy my visit here. The lines are ridiculously long for one, but unfortunately people are unable to follow rules by no flash photography and speaking, therefore ruining the experience for fellow passengers on the shuttle around, as well as it not being very nice for the animals. It could be executed much better with enclosed shuttles."
,,Night safari - I must have missed something!,3.0,,"First off, if you imagine yourself coming home with photos of a lion in moonlight from the train that goes around the garden, think again! Moving train + low light = tan colored blur in photograph. It felt like a retro tourist attraction from the beginning. I caught myself thinking that this is what my grandparents must have experience on an exotic vacation to Hawaii back when. But if you like animals... they are there! I imagine photo taking is better off the train, but be warned, it can be hot and the walk is 1 hour. I took a tour and the cost was a bit high overall, but we got to avoid the long long lineup. Also, I quiet enjoyed the fire show, although I worry about the health of those young men ingesting so much lamp oil or what have you... it certainly didn't smell non-toxic. The fire dancing fellows however looked to be quiet healthy and were much more energetic than the animals. :)"
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"We got there at 7.35. p.m. (5 minutes after opening time) They told us if we wanted to be driven around on a tram we would have to wait more than two hours.
We walked around.
Overall it was quite good. You see a lot of interesting animals and our children enjoyed it. The downside was no tram availability and the kids got tired. A tip is buy your tickets online you will save money and maybe get there before opening to get on a tram."
,,A must see,5.0,,So wonderful to see animals in a friendly environmental Zoo - the Night Safari was wonderful after the extended wait to get in there - masses of bus tours and others - not sure whether it was school holidays or if this is always like it. Shame the Aussie enclosures were under renovation. Allow all day and into the night for this adventure.
,,Feels like a safari and more,4.0,,The tram ride is a good way to start the park tour. The amazing ride takes you through the whole park with areas where then animals are able to walk right beside the tram! Feels so much like a real Safari without the danger of being mauled. A star attraction worth visiting. I only wished it was bigger. Having said that we covered the tram ride and walked the entire park in 4 hours till closing time. So even if it were bigger we wouldn't be able to finish it.
,,Not as good as many other ZOO or Reserves!!,3.0,,"The park is normally open 7:30 pm to 11:59 pm.
The restaurant and gift shops open a bit early at about 5:30pm.

This wildlife park gets kind of boring because as the name suggests it opens at sunset. And you are not able to see many things, even if you do, you are not able to enjoy the surroundings or the see the animals properly.

The park boasts of preserving a wide range of animals, but even if you start early you will not be able to have a glimpse of each one of them.
Many because of night, many because of a very confusing network of trails.
The atmosphere was also very humid, so every thing combined, it was very uncomfortable.
There are insects, and big spiders crawling here there so you might have a free forest experience. And due to lack of light you might not be able to evade them.
And obviously the camera has to have a very good night photo capability without the flash, because remember you can not use the flash.

The children may find it attractive and enjoy it.
I suggest you should opt for the Singapore Zoo which is open 8:30 am to 6:00 p.m."
,,Favourite of the Singapore Zoo collection,4.0,,"I typically do not go to zoo-type attractions due to concern of animal welfare. Decided to after people told me this was a more positive experience. Definitely my favourite of the zoo collection in Singapore (zoo, river safari, night safari). Well laid out, good volume and quantity of animals. There were a couple of animals who appeared very bored and were pacing and/or shaking their head repetitively, this removes from my enjoyment by making me sad for the animal. Although we are assured that this is ""normal"" behaviour and doesn't show the animal is stressed. Overall, I would recommend Night Safari."
,,Night safari,4.0,,Did the night safari to the zoo. Had a great time and the kids loved the atmosphere and going around in the open carriage.
,,Make sure you go on a tour package,4.0,,"We have been to the night safari a few times now. Big tip - book through a tour company that has priority tram rides. Otherwise you'll spend 1.5 hours in a boiling hot queue. We got there, did the Wallaby Trail, met for the tram ride, saw the fire show and then the animal show. Finished off with a bus trip to our hotel door, all for about $8 extra."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We went on a WEEKDAY night and the place was so chaotic and so disorganized, with people shoving left and right. I can't imagine the madness on a weekend night. There weren't any clear directions on what to do once you enter the park. We were greeted once we entered, with a line that wound around near the entrance, with no end in sight. It was the line for the train, and we stood in it for what seemed line an eternity. The ride was enjoyable when you could see the animals. We also went around the walking trails, which was better and less crowded. The price was a bit steep and I was disappointed and wish I spent my money elsewhere."
,,So close yet safe....,4.0,,"At night you don't really see the glass enclosures....you feel you are there with the animals, yet very safe from their taste buds, Make sure you taken in the presentation from the caretakers. So much to learn about the animal kingdom!
To the best of my knowledge this is the only night safari of its kind in the world. If readers have been to any other similar safari's I would like to hear."
,,For a fun filled evening,5.0,,I had a very fun filled evening is Night safari . It starts with a small show primarily for children but the walk on different trails was really thrilling .Don't miss this place while visiting singapore.
,,"Nice, but...",3.0,,"...if you're travelling allone, you might feel like beeing on the wrong place. To many people everywhere and nothing else then a expensive Tourist trap. But the trails are really nice. You probably see lots of different animals. Bring your children and you'll see they're gonna be really happy."
,,A gud way to start your trip,4.0,,I was welcomed in singapore with d night safari. 20 minutes of night safari and you can see animals from all over the world. After d night safari one should not miss creatures of d night. End d day with the amazing fire show
,,Educational and Entertaining!,5.0,,"We did the night safari and enjoyed every minute of it. The safari has a shuttle tour around the park which has an English speaking commentary of the animals you are seeing. The safari has a range of animals to see and gives you a bit of background information on each of them. You can also walk around the park at your own pace. The way the park has been set up allows you to get really close to the animals.

With the actual zoo and the river safari you could easily spend a full day there. With only doing the night safari I feel we missed out some animals such as the monkeys!

All in all the night safari is a very good attraction!"
,,Death by Boredom,1.0,,"Entry charge of S$ 42 plus nearly $20 of commuting. All this to see animals behaving strangely in front of large audience. Not worth at all. If you have visited any zoo in your life , save your money and avoid this place."
,,New experience,4.0,,"I like it very much! New experience to see the animals at night. It took about 2.5 hours to finish the visit. Suggest you to enter the safari at 7pm, so it can be finished by 10pm and back to hotel around 11pm."
,,"Must try in Singapore, but beware of lines",4.0,,"Really interesting experience. Quite a long lines for the train itself, but you can explore walking paths while everyone else is standing still in the queue. ""creatures of the night"" show is also a highlight - with good portion of humor (on top of the wildlife of course)"
,,Nocturnal craze,4.0,,"There's a big rush for the night safari so go early.flash photography not allowed,but come up and close with a lot of animal who roam around your carriage and are not kept in cages but let loose ,except for the tiger offcourse."
,,Depressing,1.0,,This was definitely one of the most depressing animal zoo's I have been to. The animals all looked miserable and while it was commercially very well done I would not support this environment for any creature!
,,One evening at the 'Safari',5.0,,"We (my wife and myself) went to the night safari which was situated in the Zoo itself. It was crowded with tourists and the locals alike. We were wondering how will it be! There was a long queue, a long swirling queue. A tram would come, put people who were in queue and this was done every minute. So, finally our turn came. We were excited!
The commentator was quite interesting. She gave us briefing about the different animals. And the best part was - all the animals were kept in the open. I guess there were some gaps (holes) from the road where the tram passed from those animals (but boy, they were close!!). The LION was sitting like a king on top of the rock (like in The Lion King)...Animals from different parts of the world like Africa, India etc were brought in. What i also liked was they were spreading awareness about how animals should be protected so that our ecosystem survives..Also, other fun part was the entertainment show where there was enactment from various animals.
Highly recommend people to go there. And children will also love it.."
,,Night Safari @ the Zoo,5.0,,"My son, his wife, twin grandsons & I went to the night safari at Singapore Zoo, it was great experience! The boys (just under 3 years old) really loved seeing all the aminals and ther was lots of walking to do."
,,Not that great,3.0,,"There are 2 things to do here
1) The show done by the team
2) Tram travel to see the Animals
Both of them as per me are ok and is average fun.
Kids will love it, for adults and teenagers there are better places to go."
,,Animal's Night Life,5.0,,"There are two offers for you: walk through dark alleys of the zoo or ride one of their trains. Depend on your budget. I suggest you to walk, that's where you can observe the predators walking around. if you love the nature, you can easily feels like home. But if you are not, don't forget to bring flash light just in case it gets to dark for you."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Nice place for kids and adults both ..not be missed during singapore trip ..a bit crowded in peak seasons
,,Excellent and comfortable night zoo experience for all ages!,5.0,,Easy access carriages take you on the train around the specially designed zoo at night with the spacious animals habitats set out around the tracks for best viewing conditions.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"There's a reason for the crowds. This place is really worth the trip. Queues for the shows and team rides were long but well managed. Do not miss them. The walking trails were deserted and the best part of the attraction, especially because few other people utilise them. Food choices are expensive and I suggest eating earlier at the nearby KFC at the zoo entrance. Check restaurant closing time."
,,After the Day Zoo - the second act!,5.0,,"We did this and teh day Zoo on teh same day both are great but make sure you are up for a long day and pace yourself! We came over from teh day Zoo and had a great meal while we waited on the Safari opening. There was a fair bit of entertainment going on around us so that kept us interested.
The trains that take you round are comfortable enough, and the sights and sounds out there are awsome. teh Show at the end was very good and you can go walk about on some trails that are set out - we chose the shortest as we were starting to fade a bit. Great experience and a must do if you are in Singapore."
,,Too many people and very disorganised,3.0,,"We were looking forward to this and had been told by a number of friends that it was great. From the pint of view of seeing nocturnal animals out and about it certainly is. What they neglected to mention was that we needed to be prepared for the huge amount of people, many of whom had left their manners at home and felt that it was ok to push in or jump the queue. Happened once too many times for my wife and when she was told by the tram attendant that we would have to wait for tram 4 (2 empty ones went by without even stopping), she lost it at him and told him in no uncertain terms that the VIPs could wait their turn as they weren't even ready to get on board. They certainly jump at every opportunity to market souvenirs to the customers."
,,very good,5.0,,"very good, especially for kids bcoz we can see the animals in their natural habitats.photography is not interesting as flash is not permitted..the shows in amphitheatre is also one time watch"
,,Horribly disorganized and terrible customer service.,2.0,,"You will enter and be forced to wait one hour for a tram without clear directions how to go to the walking trails. The trams will be poorly run, allowing multiple seats to go by empty without occupant while you wait in the hot Singapore weather. If you happen to have an issue with your booking, customer service will be unable to help at all when its within their power to serve you. You are in Dantes fifth level of hell and you paid for the tickets."
,,Enjoyable visit.,5.0,,This was our second visit and it's always a lot of fun. Although there were a lot of visitors this time everything was well organised. Good for children
,,Dont waste time on tram first!!,4.0,,Once you reach the place get a map which will show you a tram way and a walking trail way. Do not- I repeat do not- go first for the tram ride if you see a loooooong que for it. People think its better to go for tram ride first to avoid crowd and after wasting 1-1.5 hours in the que they do the 20 mins tram and then get tired and do the walk. If you start with the walk first you will see that the tram ride que is much smaller later. So yeah take your time watching the interesting set-up of the animals who seem to be set free to attack you (but never do). Its different from a regular zoo experience so i fully recommend taking out one evening for this.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"A nice place to visit with kids when you are in Singapore. A well maintained place and well coordinated. The queues can be long though, so have patience. Take out time and reach early. Walk around and have a feel of the place. Kids will enjoy the place"
,,Great for Families,4.0,,Fire show at start was awesome. Plenty of animals on display. Shows were very good although Very crowded. Would recommend weeknight visit only.
,,Worth it,4.0,,"After getting to the night safari at 630 we were greeted by massive lines. So decided to go and eat dinner ( pretty expensive but ok food) After the crowds of people had rushed through to get to the trams first we decided to stroll through and go straight to the show- got a seat easily. Show was pretty average, was more about the presenter than the animals who were on show for 30 secs each! We then proceeded to a walking trail with no line up and we weren't competing for a spot to get a view of the enclosures.
Saw some great animals on our walks- leopard was hiding which was a shame! We decided to walk to a team station after about an hr as it was quite humid.
Team ride was not packed at this time and got a seat together easily. Well worth doing saw a lot more animals this way and had commentary telling us about the animals. Saw the wolves howling at the moon which was a highlight!
Pretty easy to get a taxi, left the park at 1030pm.
Reccommend the night safari just don't get turned off by the lines think smart and avoid the poplar things first then there is plenty of room later won't miss out on anything."
,,Amazing wildlife in a city state,5.0,,The night safari is truly an amazing experience. The tram ride takes you around the zoo with animal roaming around you yet you feel so safe and comfortable with excellent commentary from the in house guide. The creatures of the night show is a treat for all young and old. The fires how was simply spectacular with those guys blowing fires all over and creating that beautiful night scene. My favourite amongst the 3 themes zoo.
,,Night Safari at the Zoo,4.0,,WE did the night safari with a meal in the zoo gardens beforehand. This was very reasonably priced. Can be long queues for the 'trains' but our coach party was pre booked so that wasn't a problem. This is probably the best way to do it.
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,"The experience of watching a lion without a cage from as close as 10 feet in pin drop silence at night is definitely an incredible experience. I have visited jurong bird park, zoo and river safari but nothing cones an iota close to what night safari offers. An amazing variety of animals set in breathtaking ambience where fear melts into excitement. It is a must visit for anyone visiting Singapore."
,,New twist on a visit to zoo,4.0,,"liked the well signposted trails, initial show with giant snake, don't sit too near the front as you might end up with it round your neck!
Many of the animals were so well camouflaged it took time and patience to see them in their habitat.
Train ride to transport you to the more difficult areas to access.
Very acceptable snack bars with choice of oriental cuisines.
Thought the souvenir shop was expensive."
,,Nice change to a day time zoo.,5.0,,"We went on a Sat night and arrived with about 5 bus loads of other people. We waited in the long line up walking in, but didn't really need to. If you just walk straight in to the entrance plaza, you can walk through the shops and/or have a drink while you wait at a table close to the stage where they do the fire show at 8pm

We then went right to the creature show for 8:30pm, followed by a walk on the Wallaby Trail to watch the Lion feeding for 9:30.

We continued on to get us to the Tram Junction and caught the Tram all the way back around so we could finish with the Leopard and Catfish Trail to end the night by 11'ish. I think in hindsight this was a good choice as the line ups for the tram were huge at the beginning of the night. We paid for the service fee to order a cab and skip the line-up to get home by midnight.

An awesome night out!"
,,Night out animal way,5.0,,"The best place for night safari. I was very surprised they are offering this attraction. Take a walk , see the animals , don't miss the fire show its simply the best . Nice atmosphere, less people , a lot of fun"
,,Well organised,4.0,,We all enjoyed our visit to the night safari I think pre booking is an advantage we did thru www.Viator.com and missed all the queues and got pre booked table for our meal as we did a combo zoo meal deal worth it guide was excellent and funny do try
,,Too busy & hot to enjoy properly.,3.0,,"While the Night Safari is a great experience once you're on the train, it is soured by how long the lines are to board the train & how big the crowds are to attend the show. This makes it difficult to enjoy with young kids. Perhaps getting there earlier would have helped????"
,,Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"The night safari was good, walk around yourself after you've had the tram ride. Only problem was I pretty much had no photos on the tram as every picture I'm moving."
,,Great and unique attraction for all ages,5.0,,"Keep the evening free for the night safari, you will easily need 3 to 4 hours to leisurely enjoy this place.

Get here early, by around 6:00 PM, buy the tickets and enter. Usually there are large and noisy crowds waiting to enter in for the first tram ride. You can avoid this crowd by spending some time having a drink or a snack, watch the enthralling fire and dance show, and taking the tram ride a bit later. Alternatively, you can start by taking the many walking trails, and then get on the tram ride.

There is a very large collection of animals at this zoo, more than 100 types. The tram ride covers most of the animal enclosures, but some enclosures can only be seen on the walking trails. The tour guide on the tram provides explanations in English, throughout the ride. The walking trails are well marked out and there are zoo staff posted along the trail to help you with directions. The use of camera flash is prohibited as you obviously will disturb the animals, the darkness and dim lighting makes photography difficult.

Its an unique experience, seeing animals up very close. There are no fences around the animal enclosures and the moats are so designed that you cannot see them. Its a surreal experience, the darkness and the clever lighting blurs the boundaries between you and the animals. You walk by so close to the animals that you feel that you can reach out and touch them. I recommend both the tram ride and the walking trails, both are immensely enjoyable.

When I bought the tickets, I thought that it was pricey, but then at the end of my visit realized that it was very much worth it. The tram tour guide and the zoo staff very polite and helpful. I think this is one of the best zoo's in the world.

The nearest MTR station is Ang Mo Kio (North-South/ Red line), from where Bus Number 138 (approximately 20 minutes ride) drops you to the entrance. Also check the timing of the last MTR train out of Ang Mo Kio, as you may need to plan your exit from the zoo accordingly. Prior to your visit, do check out the night safari website (www.nightsafari.com.sg) for special discounts and offers."
,,Different experience,3.0,,"Enjoyed Night safari but not that something which can't be missed. The fire show at the beginning was really nice. Takes huge dedication. Kudos to the performers. Then there's a tram ride to view all the animals in their natural habitat. It's enjoyable esp when u hv toddlers with you. Otherwise you can walk on the marked trail also. There was show of animals also. Much hyped, okay thing. Finished v.fast. With loads of tourists and rush sometimes good places can't b enjoyed much. This is definitely a different experience to have, but do visit Singapore zoo and Zurong bird park if possible."
,,Staged but alright for children,3.0,,Don't expect fireworks or anything that'll surpass the real deal (ie an actual safari) Also be prepared to queue for 1.5hrs unless you hold a vip pass. Overall the experience was pleasant but more recommended for children.
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"The shows are very neat and have very while trained animals in them. Also, the fire show is absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend to try this out!"
,,Worthwhile visit,4.0,,"Have visited twice. Worth a visit. Suggest to book through a travel agent that has priority access to the trams, avoiding long queues. Note that food is very expensive."
,,Disappointing........,3.0,,"This was highly recommended by a few people and also by online reviews. Admission was $42 per person, which we thought was high considering that Night Safari is only open from 7:30 pm - midnight. We knew going in about the price, but figured what the heck - we may never visit Singapore again.....

Near the entrance, they have a ""Fire Show"" which was somewhat entertaining. Lots of restaurants to choose from also. Once the Safari section opens, there are about 5 or 6 lines available to have your ticket scanned. Be prepared to wait, and also to get shoved around. After your ticket is scanned, you have a choice of lining up for a tram tour, or you can do the walking trails. We chose to do the trams.

Where do I begin?...... (1) it was like lining up at Disney World on their worse day. (2) we waited and walked the line for almost 1 hour. (3) it felt like a game of tackle because we were constantly trying to block people from cutting in front of us as we went around corners. (4) I actually DID have a confrontation with 4 Indian men who one by one, inched and pushed their way past us. The final straw was when they made 2 more of their friends jump the rope to join them. It turned into an ugly scene with us telling them how rude, inconsiderate, and unfair they were to everyone else. (5) when we finally boarded the tram, we were HIGHLY disappointed with the ride. THEY say it's 40 minutes, but it felt shorter than that, and extremely rushed. They only stop the tram 3 or 4 times for a few seconds so you can TRY to take a picture. Good luck with the other times..... They do a rolling drive-by. No flash allowed, and understandably so, so you would think they would allow you more opportunities for a decent picture.

We spoke to 2 people about our feedback and disappointment (one being a Manager). No offer of compensation, whether monetary or discount for a return visit, or coupon for food, etc. Nothing. It's as if they don't care.

I would not recommend this attraction based on my experience..... Not even if they paid me. I gave it 3 Stars (average) because other than my Night Safari experience, it seems like a nice place to visit."
,,'SUPER 'SAFARI,5.0,,"The NIGHT SAFARI is a must do ,on your visit to SINGAPORE.We get to see all the wild animals in their natural habitat at a close range too ! . We saw the Hyena ,Tiger and a Tapir came very close to us.The TRAM RIDE was really good.We can take pictures without flash .They also take pictures and charge 25 SGD for the same .

The FIRE SHOW was really AWESOME d 'ont miss it !

You can buy some good Jerkin and Towels here to take back home .The ICECREAMS were
also were very good.

Our group and family had an exciting time !"
,,Night Adventure for all ages,4.0,,"This is somewhere to go when you have a night free. You tend to see different animals than the day visit, but because it is done at night, there is a different atmosphere. Great for the kids."
,,"Pricy, long waiting lines and lots of people",3.0,,"The price of the ticket SGD42 is a bit on the expensive side. That includes the tram ride too. If you get there when the park opens then you will be in the middle of a crowd Pushing, baby crying line for 2 hours. I recommend not to go early! Wait till the crowds of kids and strollers are gone, after 9pm should be ideal.

The walking tours are great fun and you see many animals at night. Animals repeat though.

Singapore zoo costs less and you see more animals. At this zoo attraction you pay the 'nocturnal' price."
,,"Terrific Night Safari, a must ..... Dont miss ! - Singapore, worth it !",5.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari ..... Top Tip : Avoid the Guided Bus Tour, and go on your own as its very much better value as the Bus Tours may get in quickly, but they are also the very first to leave - leaving You very little time to explore . The Sing. Zoo closes at 5pm - 5.30pm .... The Night Safaro opens around 6.30pm ..... I did the Two Attractions in the One Day . They are beside each other ! A Camera / Video s an absolute must bring , I went with my two young - uns and they loved it .... terrific in most respects, very ell worth it, the night Safari s much cooler too"
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"It is a bit pricey, but it is worth the money. There was billions of people, however 99% of them went on local train. We took walking trails (where were we alone) and it was really nice. The animals are close and you can watch them hunt, it is really cool. Once the walking trails are done, you can take the train which is empty by that time."
,,Singapore Tour,4.0,,Fantastic place to enjoy! Neat & Clean! Live animals which was around our tour car which was so much interesting! Fire display in front of Night Safari was interesting!
,,A bit disappointed,3.0,,"Visited both the night safari and the new river safari. The latter was a bit disappointing overall with exhibits missing and some pretty small tanks for some of the creatures. Wish I'd visited the actual zoo instead but ran out of time!

Enjoyed the night safari but the queues were a nightmare! Recommend doing the walk first to avoid them!"
,,Don't miss walking trails,4.0,,Very crowded on certain days. Animal show in beginning is ok. The safari ride is good but very crowded. Almost 50 minutes waiting time.
,,its a most,5.0,,very good and very large ZOO the show is also amazing . its worth going to this attractions wpuld recommend
,,Chaos Reigned Supreme!,1.0,,"A planned visit to this 'experience' was much anticipated as a birthday celebration. Upon arrival a good area for enjoying a meal or purchasing souvenirs which was complimented by fire eaters and dancing prior to the Night Safari opening. No brochures were given out and these had to be requested, Apparently 3 experiences were outlined with the first a tram ride through the park to view the nocturnal animals.
When the access gates opened the crowd pushed forward with no planned lines. People were knocked over, children and tour groups became separated - which created chaos and tears. Once through the ticket gate the pushing began again as families etc tried to reunite and pushed forward though exiting queues with prams etc creating a very hostile crowd. After an hours wait in the line we were assigned to a tram and waited a further 30 minutes. The tram then started and an Indian group in our tram spoke so loudly along with a translater speaking over them to get their attention - that we had no idea of what we were about to see or just passed. At the end of this 20 minutes trip there was no advice - just a huge crowd to possibly visit in the other areas in the dark. We left and caught a cab back to the hotel as the return zoo buses did not commence for another hour. A total disaster and requires significant work as someone will get squashed!
Singapore usually does tourist attractions so well- however this is an epic fail!"
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Interesting to experience the zoo at night. The trails were very well done to provide an almost 'real' experience of walking in a tropical forest at dusk. Our 4 year old loved it and so did we. We didn't like the long queue to get in and the visitors who didn't care for the well being of the animals by being loud and using their flash. We wished there was more policing to reduce the disturbances. Overall, we loved it and highly recommend it."
,,Fantastic Experience,4.0,,"This is something not to be missed, it is such a unique experience and great to see the animals Behavior at night. My kids loved it and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again.
Only draw back was the cost of food, we had dinner here and it cost us $25 for 1 hamburger with small chips and another small chips. We had already brought our own waster so thankfully didn't have to buy drinks.
So pack some snacks or eat dinner first and take your own water and you will be fine :)"
,,A trip to the Day Zoo would be better,3.0,,Singapore Night Zoo was a little disappointing while I think what they have done with the Animals being so close to the Bus Train that you are driven around in is special and well organised it was quite hard to see the animals in the dim light. We were also told not to use flash photography which is understandable as it would disturb the animals. If you have a camera that will take info red photos it would no doubt be better. It is a long bus ride to the zoo but again well organised. They have quite a few food shops at the zoo and we found the food was very good. There was also quite a long queue to hop on the train and we were standing for quite a while in what I call cattle lanes. Having said all of that you could see most of the large animals very close up. Elephant's and lions etc..
,,Fun night. So much to see.,4.0,,"I really enjoyed the night safari. My advice would be arrive early, buy your tickets, sit down for a drink and a bite to eat and enjoy the fire breathing show which happens just between the Singapore Sling bar and the entrance. Don't get too worried about queuing up to enter once you have your tickets. The line moves fairly quickly and there is no huge rush. Do the walks first, dont line up for the trams. The walks take several hours and if you go on the trams after 9.30 they will be pretty quiet. There is lots to see. The tiger is a highlight and so is the creatures of the night show."
,,Best Zoo Anyone Will Enjoy over 2000 animals in small place,5.0,,"Everyone loves to watch as many different types of animals at minimum walking. Nothing like marathon or sweat it out. A lot pathways covered with natural tall trees canopy.. my family love Zoo. Been around neighbouring countries. Unfortunately nothing comes close to Sg Zoo. Recently been to Zoo at neighbour country. Paid USD60 per entry including my 3yrs kid. No kid fee - Not kidding. Only to watch 300 animals !

Must go place in Sg - Zoo. Night Safari. Values for money."
,,Night safari,3.0,,"We went here in Jan15. Our experience was average. I guess seeing wild animals at night time adds another element to the experience. It was quite crowded. The animals are generally hiding and come out during feeding time like clock work. At some of the animal habitats there is limited glass viewing space. The staff are very helpful. Make sure you get there early to avoid long queues. Best attraction was the night show. If you go there, don't miss it."
,,much better then dayzoo,4.0,,"On our recent to Singapore we went to the night safari which is much better then the day zoo, but you must go as there are different animals on show. BUY YOUR TICKETS AT THE DAY ZOO FOR THE NIGHT ZOO.
We only waited in the queue of a half an hour and went on the tram ride. Through the trails of the park in semi darkness watching the animals having their evening meal and animals walking past the tram. Very exciting. We did not have time to walk the trails to get even closer to the animals."
,,Animals - Fun to watch,4.0,,The best time to visit is in the night for the Night Safari. Try to reach by 6.30 PM. The tram rides are awesome and has three sections. The elephants & lion are rare and a treat to watch. The fire dance & the animals show is very good.
,,Nothing impressive,3.0,,Visitors have the choice of taking the trem or trail waling. I took the trem and unfortunately there is crying baby on the trem. Management should have age limit for night safari as they require visitors to remain quiet to not to disturb or scare the animals away. I would say night safari is not suitable for toddlers.
,,Amazing and great value,5.0,,Go with a tour which enables bypassing the crowd and queues because this zoo is hugely popular. Take the tram ride and enjoy quietly rolling along a dedicated pathway which passes close by the animal exhibits and enclosures. The tram has a recorded and co-ordinated commentary describing the exhibit you are passing at the time. The exhibits were close to us and highly visible because the night lights showing the animals appear to not disturb the animals at all. Allow time afterwards to stroll around other exhibits. This zoo has had plenty of money put in to make it the best possible facility. The atmosphere at night is fabulous. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
,,Okay if you love animals,3.0,,"i was a in Singapore for a company conference. We had a couple hours after a company reception - went to the safari.

Overall, it was interesting, but not outstanding in any way. Sure, the animals are more active at night, and there is the thrill of walking through the dark (but safe) jungle. However, the tram ride didn't really give a good opportunity to watch animals - we spent a few seconds at each area, and we didn't have enough time to walk all the trails.

If you go, be sure to leave yourself a couple hours for walking. The tram ride is okay, but I don't think you'll lose much by skipping it."
,,Great night!,4.0,,"Night Safari has a introduction performance by two guys who play with fire and then a one more small presentation by the other volunteers with various animals.

It then goes onto the main Night Safari, which can either be done in open electric cars or by foot. I preferred the car option. The animals are kept on open grounds and instead of cages, there are huge land gaps between the road and the ground where the animals are kept, which makes it impossible to cross. The most important thing to note is that you won't be allowed to use flash and in such a dark place, you will ultimately not end up clicking. Focus on enjoying the experience instead.

A very unique and an interesting place to experience, I must say!"
,,"Great fun, but crowded on weekends.",4.0,,"We tried the night safari, which was fun for us and kids, but was massively crowded with long lines in stifling heat & humidity on a friday night. Try the Safari or Zoo on a weekday, less crowds, easier access."
,,A good place to visit,3.0,,"We went to the zoo in the evening for the night safari. Getting there by taxi was easy. We had to wait in line before the park opened and while waiting we could enjoy the fire show. Of course it was crowded, people were rushing for the train or for the Creatures of the night show. The show was fantastic! After it we decided to walk the trials instead of waiting for the tram for at least 1 hour. Later we were able to board the tram at the second stop where the waiting time was less than 10 minutes. Overall it is a nice place to visit but be prepared to wait in line. If you go there in April I would recommend going there at night because of the temperature."
,,Unique Zoo Experience,5.0,,"The night Safari is Singapore Zoo's way of dealing with the fact that many animals, in their native habitat, are generally active at night. Whilst you can go with the crowded and pretty well organised tram tors, you really are batter off walking it, you will see more and get better pictures if you do."
,,Great experience BUT far too crowded,3.0,,"Anyone with small children should be aware that this can come with multi-hour waits. The actual Night Safari is wonderful, but only once you can get started with it and that could well take hours. We arrived at 7:30 and queued up to buy our tickets. From there we went to the entrance, where we had to queue up again. it was past 8 by the time we mad it inside the park, and then there was a huge line for the centerpiece tram ride and the staff estimated that the wait would be at least two hours. They suggested that we first go to the separate show, but there was an extensive wait for that as well while stacked in amongst a big crowd, with staff urging people to cram in closer so that there would be enough waiting room for others coming in.
After the show the line was still incredibly long so we walked around the entire park on foot. Eventually we finished that at 10pm, and then there was only a short line for the Tram.
The Tram ride itself was great and our son really enjoyed it, but had he been a bit more tired he would not have been able to stay up for it, and regardless had we known about the long wait we could have simply gone later. I would strongly suggest that the Night Safari either limit ticket sales to a capacity it can handle, or at the least put up signs at the front showing the estimated wait times."
,,Highly overrated !!!!,3.0,,"With all the hype created around the Night Safari at Singapore Zoo, it was a total disappointment. To start with, the staff knew nothing about crowd management. After the first show near the entrance, there was a huge line to get into the trams that would take your around the Zoo. It was a weekday and we had to wait close to 90 minutes to get in to one. It was humid and the kids started to get cranky with all the waiting, crowd and heat. The surprising part was that there were a few trams kept parked, in spite of the huge crowd waiting for the trams. And if you aren't lucky, you may end up at the far end of the tram, while the tour guide is on the front. When he talks about an animal, the people at the far end might see another one or even some dark spots as they are far from the front of the tram. In my opinion, the walking trails would probably more interesting that the trams. And especially with kids, I would never call it an attraction!!!"
,,Rubbish,1.0,,"Totally disorganised when you arrive, you have to queue up for an hour in stifling heat, the fans that are supposed to cool you down in the ceiling are so dirty they don't blow any air out. A fight broke out while we were queuing as people jostled to get to the front. I'm sure there is a better way to do this, by time limiting people when they book. It was just awful. The actual safari was pretty good and you do see animals but I cannot recommend it and I will not go back."
,,One of the best night attractions!,4.0,,"Definitely worth the trip down to the night safari, it was beautiful! Great entertainment and good food, could see the animals clearly and the tram ride was so fun!!!"
,,"Warm and humid, hardly saw anything",3.0,,"Some of the enclosures were great, we managed to see baby porcupines. But most of them, while on the tram, you go by so quickly and the animals are hiding. Most of the animals were hiding when we were there. Just our luck maybe?"
,,mostly bording,3.0,,"Ok to me it was a waste of time, I didn’t enjoy the safari, the animals were not clear to see at that time of a day lot of darkness but the restaurants and play stores are nicer to me.
Moreover the show after the safari was awesome it was the greatest thing of this experiences.
If you have a busy schedule I do not recommend it, there are better things to do in Singapore."
,,Disappointed with Night Zoo,2.0,,Extremely disappointed when visiting October 2012. Trains didn't even stop when travelling through the area so had no chance at all to see animals.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,We attended the Night Safari a couple of nights ago and found it really boring and not worth the money to be honest. If you are to go book with a tour as they pick you up from your hotel and it can be quite costly get there by taxi. Our tour got us through the gates quicker than standing in line and we also had a dedicated time slot for the tram ride around the park that shows you parts of they park you will not see walking. Waiting for the tram can take up to an hour normally. We did not do any of the 4 walking tracks as you cover most of the park in the tram and really there were not many animals to be seen with what was seen from the tram ride.
,,Just amazing,5.0,,This place is just amazing.. How much ever tired u are in the end.. All ur tiredness will vanish when u visit this place.. Firstlyy the thumbakars show is a must watch one... Secondly if u visit this place when it's crowded then ull have to wait for half an hour in the queue for the tramp... The best part is when ur taken in the tramp and while visiting the animals thrs a pre recorded voice which keeps telling the information about the animals... Which is really cool.. At first I was scared thinking we may not be able to see the animals but the animals were clearly visible and were in the natural habitat undisturbed which is good... Overall this was an amazing experience and must visit Place
,,Night trip...,4.0,,"It was a good night out for the family to see animals in the night. It is better to go after 9 pm when the crowd is lesser....the trip was more for the kids as we can come up close and personal with some of these animals such as the antelopes, deer...and can see Lion, Tigers, Elephants from a short distant. It was pleasant ride on the tram. The food is rather expensive so it may be economical to prepare some food on your own or have a good meal first before going to the Noght Safari....trip is more for family with young kids."
,,Must for children,4.0,,great place for children to see different animals in natural surroundings but to get to the tram is hell it took us an hour in the line and with small kids it's difficult.for adults you can take the trail but with kids it's preferable to take the tram.the time is fixed from6:00 pm to 9:00pm so if you reach a bit early it's good.but may be we went in June when it's vacation time that we encountered such a rush otherwise may be it would be a bit easy in regular months.
,,The only night zoo to go too!,5.0,,This was the greatest Zoo I every wen to. The night is the time to see the animals roam and eat while you quietly tour the areas with dim lights and quiet trolley. My best memory was the Bat area. To be so close to the giant fruit bats while they are eatting their Bannanas. I tell evry one that is going to Singapore to make the time to see this.
,,Waste of money,1.0,,The park was so busy and poorly organized that we were not even able to board the tram due to a 2 hour wait even though we paid full price
,,Not up to advertised standard.,3.0,,"We visited the Singapore Night Zoo as part of a tour package and were disappointed. Yes, you vaguely saw plenty of animals in the half light, but most were very indistinct. It was also stressed that flash photography was prohibited so we came away without any photos. Being part of a tour group we got on the tour tram promptly, but others were waiting in line up to two hours to board. If I went again I would forego the tram and walk around the various exhibits (takes about 2 hours to walk).."
,,Loved it. Particularly the night safari.,5.0,,"Loved the variety of animals, their enclosures and how it feels like you're walking through lovely gardens. We stayed for the night safari. We ignored the HUGE queue for the train and did it in foot. This meant we could spend as long as we liked looking at the animals. Our favourite were the fruit bats. I can't believe how close we got to them. What a fabulous place"
,,The finest an animal can get,5.0,,"The night safari at Singapore is as manicured and pedicured a jungle as you can get anywhere in the world. It makes the wild look docile, and all animals tameable."
,,Sad elephants... not nice,1.0,,I went to the night safari only. The small show at the beginning was quite good. But the sad elephants that sway when the mini-bus drives past was too much for me...
,,A must visit....,5.0,,"Night Safari is a must do in Singapore. The zoo is very well conserved and everything is clean and good. Fire works in the beginning and the Animal show is amazing, please be on time to grab good seats. The thing that impressed me most is how close you are from the animals. Most of them are just next to you when you go by the little train. Take the train but also do a walk around"
,,Nice place!!!!,4.0,,"I think must place to visit if you are going with kids because they will love it. Specially the night show and night ride and toys, clothes everything they will like, i think will parents will also enjoy ;)"
,,Exciting experience,4.0,,The entry dance by the fire dancers was good and so was the animals show. The tram rides are good. The animals are very well trained. Good to reach here by 5.30PM and wait here till 11PM.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,I did the night safari when i visited it included a meal which was buffet style. The actual zoo was amazing one of the best i have ever been to. Not only were there animals but also entertainers which mixed things up. If i ever go back to Singapore i would definitely do it again.
,,Unexpectedly good,5.0,,"When the Night Safari first opened in 1994, the animals were shy and less accommodated to the new environment and tourist.

It is no longer the case. Among the 2,500 animals representing over 130 species, most of them are very friendly and do not hide themselves when they saw us. The Night Safari was so well designed that it feels like walking in the wild at night and running into different nocturnal animals. (Fences of the enclosures were designed to be covered by bushes, etc., so to make the ""Safari"" experience more real)

Highlight of the park? You will see groups of Mouse Deers, they are little fluffy animals overloaded with cuteness."
,,night safari,5.0,,i loved this place. its fun to see the animals at night. they do have very good food enters near the entrance. do try them. the gift shop is little pricey
,,A must do for kids,5.0,,"Brilliant experience....my 9 yr old and us did all the walking trails first nd then went for the tram ride....it was amazing to spot the animals in the open. The mangrove walk is a must, where ou see the flying fox inches away from you eating fruits...the best experience."
,,Most enjoyable Tram ride and walk through,5.0,,"The night Safari is great, it starts with a tram ride if you want to stay in the cue and I suggest you do just that. After the ride you can then go for a walk through different parts of the Zoo in the dark and see the animals up close. This is much better than trying to see everything from the tram alone and if you love taking photos this is the best way to get some of the animals in your sights. The tram ride is great and the commentary from the guide is very informative. Enjoy yourself over a few hours."
,,A good experience,4.0,,"It was a good experience as we get to watch many nocturnal animals which is not possible anywhere else. The fire show was very good and the animal show is also good after the night safari.

I recommend you to stand in queue around 15-20 minutes before the opening of gates as you will be able to get good seats for the animal show."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"I love the Night Safari. First watch the Warrior Show with fire eating and dancing which is great entertainment. The food here is really good. The choices are chicken rice, curry, naans, rice, seafood, burgers and more if eating inside but also Kentucky, Pizza and a few other choices before you enter the Park. There are Two areas to see the Animals. The first is by boarding the tram to see Elephants, Wolves and more. The second is walking to see Leopards and Giant flying squirrels. Creatures of the night show is worth a look. Lightweight clothing is a must as it gets very hot and sticky on the trails but don't forget your mozzie spray. If visiting Singapore make sure this is on your list of things to do"
,,One of a kind experience,5.0,,they say it's a must do abs I couldn't agree less... What an experience..I was a bit scared but that's only because I don't like the dark too much... But my partner was was amazed and did not wanna leave the jungle.. In his words..It was cool and he felt really close to nature..the animals are literally within 2 meters range from you and there's no glass in between.. Don't worry it's completely safe..
,,Make sure you go at night!,5.0,,Go to the Zoo at night! They have a fantastic show and the atmosphere is amazing. There is a small open air shuttle that takes you in between enclosures. There are no gates which means you can see the animals up close. There is an option to walk around the zoo but unfortunately I never did it.
,,A night time well spent and relaxed.,5.0,,"It is a nice evening for everybody to enjoy.
The best time to go is during the week.
If you be there around 19.30 hour you can have something to eat next to the place where they have the fire dance and flame throwing show.

And this is a nice start of the evening( the food is not bad)

The Amphitheatre is crowded and you see a few animals doing some tricks(not that impressive).
Just leave before the end of the show to take the train for the ride through the park.

The ride is really nice, they don't rush,take the time and are overall very friendly.

Half way you can leave the train and have a walk through different trails.

Everything is looking very clean and well maintained also the animals.

When you are leaving there are enough taxi' s to bring you bag where you want.

A evening well spent."
,,I have never seen anything like it,4.0,,"This attraction is geared for families. Kids will love it. This place runs a safari tram, it's important that the kids keep quiet if any animals are to bee seen, they don't like screaming children! The que for the tram is very long early in the evening. It's better to keep occupied by attending shows and trails until after 10pm, the que for the tram gets shorter by then."
,,The Best,5.0,,when in Singapore a must visit for every tourist. Very well organised by the tourism department & the animals are well maintained too.
,,The animals looked drugged,1.0,,"The place is actually very nicely done, however i couldn't help but feel like the animals looked drugged and drowsy the entire time. Unfortunate what we humans do for our entertainment!"
,,Just a demonstration of the so-called or so-believed human power,2.0,,"21st century and we are still paying to see animals in cages. Big cages ok, but cages after all.
I paid and visited this zoo and regreted it at the sight of the first animal.
You have lots of real jungles, trekkings, and free animals so close to Singapur. This is just seeing animals trying to sleep with the lights on while humans walk by or get on a 20minute ride train to see them.
Not worth it. I really just hope people realize what they are really paying for when entering this place, and stop doing so."
,,Night Safari at Singapore Zoo,5.0,,This was a wonderful experience. The train round the zoo was very packed so we walked most of the way around. Lovely to see the animals of a night time although if you have already done a safari in SA then probably you would find this a bit tame by comparison. Children would love it.
,,Go with an organised tour group.,4.0,,"Certainly is a must do, a completely different experience to a day zoo. Be warned though this is an extremely popular park and like others the queues are massive if not timed correctly. Friday and Sarurday's are the most busy, we did Sunday on the advice of our tour people.
We experienced a very smooth operation from start to finish with the RMG company. $58.00 pp (adult, including priority queuing) pickup from your hotel to Gardens by the Bay, immediate transfer to a larger coach to the Safari.
Tour guide Stephen was excellent from start to finish, a good clear English speaker (adding some good humour) made every aspect very clear, emphasising the importance for punctuality to expedite the priority queuing process, saving huge amounts of time, and sound advice on prioritising things to see in the park. Finally delivered back to the hotel with no delays whatsoever.
For those that like good organisation this company were great, making the whole experience very worthwhile.

Things to be aware of:

Food is really expensive, example, egg-cup of gelato = $5.90, eat before the tour and take plenty of water, the many walking trails are a highlight and are sweaty work in this high humidity weather.

Make sure you are well covered with insect repellant."
,,Good Experience,3.0,,"This is an unique experience. You can watch different animals roaming around in their cages freely at night. First night ride starts after 7 pm. You also have 4 different walking trails, which you may experience, apart from night safari ride by slow moving open van. More hype is created about this night safari. It is not that too great. One may skip it, if you have seen zoo during day time. There are different shows arranged by local staff, which can also be seen. Staff is polite. Efforts taken by staff to present & maintain this place neat & clean are really admirable."
,,Amazing - night safari was incredible,5.0,,"This is a must in Singapore! By far the best zoo I have ever been to. We saw both of the shows and the staff presenting the night creature show were great!
We arrived later than expected (we got a tad lost on the mrt!!) Arrived at about 9ish and we're done by about 11. It's open until 12 but the last shows are at 9. Will definetly be returning again"
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"good place, different experience, Unique concept. never seen anything like this before. Must visit specially if you have kids"
,,Awesome zoo concept,5.0,,"Having the animals roaming free was very cool, the moats were necessary for the big cats and hyenas, this was far better than the cages used in most zoos, well done!"
,,Real,4.0,,"Night Safari was so good. we could see real animal activity. 'Cause Many animals active at night. I thought as if we were in jangle!! And night show is also exited. But if u access by train, u have to use taxi from the nearest station"
,,Night zoo trip,4.0,,We want to the night time safari. It was okay at best. Some nomads were hard to see and the bugs were a bit bothersome. It was so hot and a breeze was seldom felt.
,,Zoological Singapore,5.0,,"The night zoo is one of the best Zoos in the world and a superb antidote for jet lagged children. Very well put together , kid friendly as you would expect , but adult friendly to point where I have just gone there with my wife on our own on occasions. The evening fire swallowing shows and Zoo theatre are a must"
,,Unique experiance especially if you have kids,3.0,,Its a very diff experience although its not sure that u will b able to see all animals but the train safari is quiet an experiance. You can strall around on your own also...
,,An Intriguing Experience,4.0,,"Night Safari breaks the stereotype that zoos are just for kids only. In fact, it provides a wide variety of activities and shows for you to explore this place, for example the train ride that allows you to observe the activities of animals at night while staying on the kart. There are also souvenir shops, restaurants, etc, so you can do some shopping and have a meal before the safari opens.

For animal lovers, they can also opt to take a walk at the trails (especially fishing cat trail and leopard trail), where they allow visitors to have an even closer look to the nocturnal animals. The animal show is also amazing, however, it is more suitable for younger audience.

Nevertheless, visitors should plan their time and travel carefully, as it opens only at 7:30 pm and it is rather distant from the nearest MRT station Ang Mo Kio. Overall, visiting the Night Safari was a fun experience."
,,OMG they are so close!,5.0,,"I took friends to the night safari and honestly it was such a great night. The kids (8 & 12) loved it and the parents had a fabulous time too.
We arrived early as I was worried about traffic, good plan as we had time for some snacks and drinks from Bongo Burgers.
The fire breathing show is fun and worth waiting for.
The nocturnal animal show could have been better, not too many animals.
The tram was great, there was a bit of a wait but not too long maybe 15 mins. But it is a great way to see the animals. They were awake and just there. It feels like there is no fences between you and the animals.
I highly recommend this as something to d in Singapore and because it's at night it's not too hot.
Make sure you take insect spray."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"There's not much to see. Some of the animals were resting, hiding somewhere. The visibility is not as clear as it is in the day."
,,Must Visit Place for animal lovers,5.0,,"One of the amazing and thrilling part of your Itinerary when you travel to Singapore. This Safari consist of experience customer friendly guides. This place is far away from the city and limited access by MRT (metro). Best way to reach Night Safari is to book through your hotel on SIC (sharing basis). Must watch is the ""Creatures of Night Show"" and Tramp ride along the safari campus. Leopard trail is also good option. There's one restaurant called ULU ULU famous for local and Indian Cuisine. Incase it rains, few of the shows are then cancelled."
,,Definately recommend!!,5.0,,This was recommended as well wroth a visit - well it is!!! If you want a good experience and getting up close to some of the bet and well looked after animals on a night time safari don't miss this experience. For adults and children...
,,It's a farce,2.0,,"The pick up from hotels is rather well organized and punctual. But then you are dropped off at the Gardens by the Bay to kick your heels and do nothing for almost an hour after paying the S$ 58 (USD 43) per head fee. There is no fixed time for departure and you are instructed not to go too far as the coach will leave as soon as everyone is brought and dropped there. The drive to the park near the center of the island is a long one but the guide gave an interesting commentary. It was basically propaganda about the Singapore government and how clever and good it was.

On arrival at the park you are herded along to the entrance with a warning that the bus to the hotels will depart at sharp 10.05 p. m. and that there is a taxi stand for those who miss it. The taxi fare to any hotel in Singapore from there is S$43 and we regretted for not taking that option. We foolishly waited for the appointed hour to come back in the tour coach and by the time it dropped off many others at various hotels our drop off got very late. To make matters worse the guide kept telling the driver (strangely in English and not in Mandarin as with all other conversations between the two, many times and very loud) that the company should not accept to drop people from Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel because it is too far away and that the company makes a loss by taking such passengers. there were 4 of us and we really should have taken that S$ 43 taxi back to the hotel. We could have saved the 1 1/2 hour wait for the appointed time of 10.05, got to the hotel directly without sitting through all the other passenger drop offs and eaten some decent food at the hotel. The food at the Night Safari food court is of extremely poor quality and about three times the normal price.

This is just a zoo. the only difference is that three are more trees. and you are there at night. The animals are nocturnal animals and they appear to be terribly traumatized and stressed due to the shorter nights day after day. Their enclosures are lit with bright lights when they should be in darkness. We were told that the lights simulated moon light but triple full moons every day of the year must definitely be affecting the animals.

There is supposed to be a CREATURES OF THE NIGHT show included. But it was full when we arrived and it was full again when our ride returned back to base. The fire show was nothing like the dinner show effect created by the advertisements. It was just 3 muscular Malay men filling their mouths with petrol and blowing it onto blazing torches. The audience sits in the open air sweaty & humid food court eating the ridiculously expensive junk food and watch the show. If it rains you get wet and when people go and stand between you and the show there is nothing you can do.

This is a farce that we could very well have skipped and saved almost half a day and a lot of money."
,,Must experience!,5.0,,An awesome experience. Unlike any safari you might have done. The lighting is so good (not sure how friendly it is for the animals though). There is also a lot of entertainment besides the safari in the area.
,,See it to believe it,4.0,,The park may not be that large but you could end up spending a lot of time there. Do take the tram first to get a gist of.what you'd like to see before taking the trails to see the animals upclose and as long as you want. It's not guaranteed that you'll see all the animals though as some are probably hiding. Great place even for adults to visit.
,,Interesting experience,4.0,,"Interesting experience, seeing animals at night like this. Good commentary as we went around. The restaurant with a Singaporean buffet was reasonably good but the fire dancing show was something we could give a miss to. The animal show in the open air amphitheatre was quite entertaining, especially the otters sorting rubbish into the correct recycling bins!"
,,Great place,4.0,,"Brought this tour on Expedia including round trip pickup/ drop off from hotel.

Got picked up and dropped off at Chinatown to transfer onto the main coach bus. Well organised I think the tour company was tour East?

The queue was horrendous and we got there around 7:10 and they open at 7:30. Once we got in the queue for the tram was 1hour and 30 mins.

Firstly we did the fishing at trail as the tram does not go into that area and you can make out most of the animals again due to low light taking photos was difficult.

We then did the tram ride which lasted about 35 mins and took you into areas which you can not access by foot and get really up close to the animals. Please bye flash photography is not permitted someone in our group got told off multiple times for this.

Lots of eating places around the safari and great way to spend the evening"
,,Not to be missed experience!,5.0,,"I drove to the site and parked near the Sg Zoo area. A short walk and we were at the night safari. The queue was unbelievably long! There are lots of foreigners/children and there is a lot of pushing and rushing in the queue as if the animals would leave the park after the show and it was the last day for the exhibit. After practicing some patience, we managed to get to the gates. Better crowd management by the park authorities could have prevented this rush and disorganized queuing. In the middle of the mess, a fire show starts with some lads blowing fire out of their mouths, etc and the queue comes to a standstill as everyone starts taking pictures and watching this show although there are shows like that through the night. Then the queue goes into the tram ride which is another long miserable wait. We skipped the tram and went straight to the creatures of the night show which starts at 7.30pm. Be early to get seats as there were many who ended up standing. The show is short so be early. Once the show is over you can watch the fire show and take a walk on the nearest trail (wallaby trail) which leads you to the tram queue where there are not many people waiting. The tram ride is excellent, close to animals and worth taking at least once. The highlights for me were the lions, leopard, rhino, hippo, hyena.The tapirs and deer come close to the tram (within touching distance - but you are not supposed to touch). The lighting in the park is sufficient and nice for you to witness the events. Visit on lion feeding days (weekends). Don't bother taking a camera as flash are not allowed and you can't get any decent photos without a flash. You can take pictures inside the tram and a few selfies but thats about it. There are tons of shops selling bites, meals and drinks. The toilets are clean. Try the bongo burger bar or the zebra cafe hotdogs. There is a bar in the park too. Most of the outlets are open till midnight but be aware of the last call at the bar/kitchen which could be earlier (10.30pm). We spent around 3 to 4 hours in the park which is more than enough for slow walks, tram rides and walks on all the trails so if you arrive at 6.45pm you will finish before 10pm and therefore taking a cab won't incur the extra midnight charges. The Hyena portion was my favorite as its so close and feels like they can just leap out at you! The deers located just opposite must be driving them wild as all they can do is look! The rest I will leave it to you to discover....."
,,Great night of surprises,5.0,,"The night Safari is a wonderful experience especially with kids. The train ride is fun but walking around afterwards offers a host of surprises, especially seeing a family of Hyena's 10 feet away across a ditch, awesome!"
,,A MUST TRY,4.0,,"You should try this, amazing night safary. Take the evening tram ride to make the most of it. Can not imagine that I was that close to African White Lions, Elephants and more. Be prepare for a long queve when weekend"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a nighttime experience like no other. You are driven around the park which is well lighted and are able to view the wild animals roaming around. Quite an experience and safe.
,,Not to be missed but bring your own food!,5.0,,"Took my American friend who was visiting to the night safari. I myself have not been in at least 4 years. It was definitely a key highlight of her trip.

The shows were amazing, the staff were helpful and friendly. We especially loved the bat enclosure where you could get so close that you could touch them.

The only disappointment was the lack of food options when you are deep inside the park. The variety of food on offer were pathetic, even though it didn't matter cause the food kiosks were out of any form of food (even packet crisps) by 830pm!"
,,Pretty cool getting that close to the animals,5.0,,"Not sure how they accomplish this trick, letting you see the animals without them seeing you but it was impressive. It was very expensive just buying tickets on site. I recommend buying one of multi-park passes."
,,very congested,3.0,,We found the night safari very tiring as we had been at the zoo all day and the temperatures were 35+ degrees. I would recommend splitting this attraction into two visits.
,,Night with animals!!,5.0,,Very well organised and the tour in that little train is amazing where all animals are moving around you live and not in the cage except few. wonderful experience.
,,Worth the hypr,5.0,,"Everyone raves about the Night Safari at Singapore Zoo but until you have done it yourself you wonder what all the hype is about. You are transported around the site on a fairly quiet road train and will see nocturnal animals which has of course you wouldn't see in a day visit. Good value for money, the children loved it as did the grown ups."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"We booked the Night Safari through our Kuoni Rep at our hotel and it was great value for money.
We was picked up at 6pm and returned to the hotel just before 11. The night safari is well worth doing - So glad we did it.
Make sure you use a lot of bug spray the night you do it as I got the only bite of my holiday here and it was massive.
It is lovely to be able to go around the Zoo at night and see all of the animals up and awake. They are not caged in either and have lots of space.
You start with the tram that takes you around the main areas of the zoo and then you have the option to walk around some of the trails. You have enough time to do both."
,,Choose the right time to visit,4.0,,"Even after visiting Singapore Zoo’s Night Safari, we couldn’t make up our minds whether it is a very fancy place to imprison wild animals or a humane way to protect them. It certainly is a good place to see a whole host of local and regional animals in roughly their right environment after dusk, when they are mostly at their most active. It certainly seemed educational for the hordes of people who were seeing these animals up-close and personal for probably the first time – especially the children. We are not experts, but we didn’t see any obviously stressed animals and the rangers we spoke to seemed informed and caring people. We are still unsure.
But if you are going, you should try to choose the best time. Most people turn up between 6pm and 7.30pm, when the safari trams start winding their way round the beautiful grounds. This means the queues for the trams are horrendous. The staff try their best to get people onto the trams as quickly as possible, but we still queued for almost an hour on a Tuesday evening. The trams are worth going on, but if you are reasonably mobile you might want to walk the main trails first and then catch a tram when the crowds have dwindled. There's plenty of written information at each of the animal enclosures and you can pick up the trams from several stations around the park. We were warned to buy our tickets online, but there was no queue at the ticket booths when we arrived so I’m not sure.
Finally, while there are several ways of getting there and back by MRT and bus, it can be up to 1.5 hours each way from Singapore City Centre, so we caught a taxi there and back. It was more expensive (around S$24 each way including the ERP fee), but split between four people would be much closer to the MRT/bus fares and it takes only 25 minutes between the zoo and downtown Singapore. There were plenty of taxis in the cab rank when we left the zoo at 10.30pm.
If you love zoos or if you are not entirely sure you’re opposed to them, the Singapore Night Safari is worth a visit."
,,Went from bad to great,5.0,,"The general manager, Emi, did an exceptional service and went above and beyond to ensure our family's experience went well.
We had ordered food so we could eat and watch the fire blowing show. A mistake was made at the point of payment and my wife was unable to watch any part of the show because of this error. After I explained the situation with Emi he organized a private buggy tour after we watched the following fire blowing show, which is a must see.
Our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable with regards to the animals. Because of this experience I am highly recommending the Night Safari to any and everyone.
Thank you for turning what could have been a disastrous night into a night to remember."
,,A different experiance,4.0,,I was alone but I enjoyed the ride ... It was nice to see the animals in the night and it was well organized
,,gr8 with friend and families,3.0,,"Must visit zoo, best to visit with kids and family. dont forget to attend the night safari and carry eatables as the restro in zoo is on the expensive side. Bus and taxi regularly visit the zoo."
,,went with disabled husband,5.0,,remember to not wait in line. go to front of line to be let on front as lining up can be hard on back.
,,night safari,4.0,,"went on night safari ,long lines for elderly to wait. More notices if you have a walking stick need to be seen as these people can go in front of train without long standing waiting."
,,Bit Average,3.0,,"We went on Friday night & it was crowded... waited for so long so we missed so many activities there, Its not worth for what we paid. So if you still want to go better to go at-least by 6:30pm"
,,Great way of seeing nocturnal animals,5.0,,"You can be taken around the zoo in a little ""train"" and see several groups of nocturnal animals. This would be particularly interesting for children who like animals. The restaurant area is OK but I thought a bit over-priced - it seems that they have all fixed their meal prices at the same price."
,,Night attraction in the city,5.0,,"If you really wanna something different in singapore, you might try this night safari. The place is quite take some times from the city, but it pays you off. Very well maintained, staff are helpful, the programme are managed proffesionally. Open until midnight. Taxis are available inside. Can also be reached by bus. This place is suitable for anyone who love animals."
,,Wow.... That is quite a queue....,3.0,,"Wowsers. The queue was enormous!!!!! Fortunately, my wife has the foresight to get pregnant 8months earlier, so staff very kindly allowed us to join a priority queue so as not to stand for so long. If they hadn't done this, I probably would have done a u-turn and got a refund....

Not my first visit here, but first with my son and we loved it. It's a really great concept and a lot of fun.

Take bug protection and water. If you want a beer (reward) at the end, be at the bar before 10pm!!!!"
,,Worth it with tour group only!,4.0,,"The night safari was definitely fun. We saw some animals we had never seen before. For those animals we had seen (i.e. lion) it was great to see them active and moving around. We took a tour company and are SO glad we did that. It was a little more expensive, however, when we arrived at the safari, the wait to get on a tram was 2.5 hours. We were completely able to skip that entire line and walk right onto a tram without waiting. I suggest you take the time to walk around the trails after the tram ride."
,,Amidst the Amazing Animals,4.0,,The night safari is an amazing tour amidst the animals and it is even better at night so an entirely different experience from other visits to zoo or safari. The animals are well kept and there are proper instructions from tour guides throughout who make the safari even more interesting with stories about the animal kingdom.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"You should take your family on this Safari. There are many more Safaris in the same place. The Animal Safari, Jurong Bird park, River Safari and Night safari.You should probably take the whole day off for the whole safari thing and there is a animal shoe in the evening which you will enjoy.So, Please make a note that even if your travel agent books only one of those safari ,Tell him you want to visit all , Since all Safari rides are different in their own way. Mainly if you have kids."
,,The line took forever; otherwise a great time!,3.0,,"booked a visit here through our hotel, and the tour was on a timetable. So when the line took a very long time, we had to rush through other parts of the zoo we didn't get to see on the tram ride. Maybe go when it isn't as crowded, or perhaps skip the tram and hit the highlights you want to see on foot. Very cool animals to see when active!"
,,Very close to animals!,4.0,,"Night Safari is a must do in Singapore. The zoo is very well conserved and everything is clean and good.
The thing that impressed me most is how close you are from the animals. Most of them are just next to you when you go by the little train.
Take the train but also do a walk around."
,,Get organised for the Night Safari,4.0,,"We went on an organised tour which in hindsight was a good use of time. This is a popular attraction and I'm told the crowds are large every evening. If you turn up in the evening you'll have to join the queues for the tram which could mean waiting longer than an hour which is more than the tour takes. We had a good buffet dinner in a spacious restaurant, after which we went into a fast lane for the tram and waited only a few minutes. It's good to see the animals at night. The fire eating show was good. Not so sure about the Creatures of the night show. Entry into the arena was a bit of scrum and not for the frail."
,,"Was a good night, but plan well",4.0,,"We went in a party of six and it was a good night, nothing exceptional, but still worth a visit. It was a Friday night and there were so many people so we decided to have dinner first, pretty expensive meals, but what you would expect from a theme park.
After dinner we headed in and could not believe the size of the queue waiting to board the trams, the night safari show was already full so we jumped on to the end of the tram queue. Our only saving grace was that one of our group was pregnant so we were fast tracked to the front of the queue, otherwise I was thinking we had a 90 minute wait ahead of us. The tram ride was good, but they need to work on syncing up their audio to what we were looking at. When we got back to the station, we were hoping to see the Night Safari Show, no luck, full again. So we headed out on the walk trails. This was a chance to see the animals from the tram ride up closer, but also other animals that we didn't see. When we finally got back to the entrance, we were hoping to sit down and watch the Night Safari Show, it was full again, so not wanting to hang around after 10 for the late show, we headed out, bought the most expensive ice-cream in Singapore and headed home. Only plus's for the staff, they were all very helpful and friendly.
Would I do that again, probably not, I think a day trip without the rush would be better... next time"
,,The Zoo at night,5.0,,"Wauw. Seeing animals at night in this very beautiful zoo, was very special. Everything well organized and interesting."
,,Interesting,4.0,,If you visit the zoo and like animals then do the night safari too. This way you see the life of some animals once its night. Interesting and safe.
,,the night tour is amazing,5.0,,"I when there for the night tour , it was great , but we had to wait in a long line for 2hrs to get on the tram.But once on it was very good.The tour guide was very pleasant and entertaining. There was a fire show and animal show which were both very good.Would recommend you get there early , cause it gets very busy."
,,Enjoyable and Must-visit,5.0,,"Get set for an amazing walk through the jungle - within just a few feet and no enclosures (at some places). This is highly recommended for nature lovers and animal lovers.

An electric vehicle takes you through the jungle on a guided tour. One can also thoroughly enjoy a good walk through the jungle and enjoy special shows till late night."
,,Not worth the visit,3.0,,"We visited the night zoo 5 years ago and not a thing has changed. This time we came with our kids and even though they enjoyed it as it was novel, for us other 5 adults, was appalled. We had to queue for 40 mins to get on a tram and as we sat at the back of the tram missed the commentary. Nothing has been updated, it smells and every 2nd animal was some variety of deer. There was nothing there that I haven't seen before at Taronga zoo, we are very spoilt here in Sydney by this zoo.
The show in the area was embarrassing and appalling, what a waste of time.
Not worth the money, maybe try the day zoo."
,,Great to see but we warned about the crowds,4.0,,"We loved the Zoo but the biggest downfall is the ""tram"" style transportation that holds up the entry into the zoo. We went during school holidays so that would have contributed to the crowds but it was really unbearable. We got there at 7pm (7.30pm open) and the line to get in was already a few km's long. My tip is to do the walking trails first, it means you can get into the Zoo quicker and do the walk around so when you are tired you can then just jump on the tram. Was a good thing to do but pick your times as the crowds spoilt our visit."
,,"Something fascinating, better than Zoo/BirdPark/River Safari",4.0,,"It was fun riding in a TRAM at night and watching all animals on both sides. A different Experience altogether. Plus you don't have sun growling at night which is a big relief. We took the Tram ride 3 times, the last one is at 11 PM. If you are on a budget, you can avoid Bird Park, Zoo and River Safari and Just do the Night Safari... its worth it."
,,MUST see,5.0,,"This is a great place to go with anybody, not just for kids. Main advice: go as early as possible because once you get in, you must wait in line to get on the tram and it can be a long wait. There is an option to do a walker trail first, but i would advise the tram first. The atmosphere is so cool, and you can see the animals first hand really unclose. It is such a different experience at night as opposed to a regular zoo during the day.

Another reason to go early and take the tram first is because you want to catch the night show. On fridays and saturdays, there is also live feeding for the lions you don't want to miss. Definitely a must see when in Singapore!"
,,Awesome Pace and Must See,5.0,,this is one of the best zoo I have ever seen in any country. It as animals from various forests; all nicely fed. You can watch them from close proximity. Do take a walking tour across the trails.
,,Great night out!,4.0,,"Enjoy my trip. We get up close with animals,do a few walking trails and watch a show. Good experience!"
,,Be careful which tour you choose,4.0,,"The Night Safari experience was wonderful. To be able to get that close to so many wild animals is great and I shall never forget the sight of a fully grown bull elephant looming out of the darkness, so close you could almost touch him!! We booked a guided tour and, although it enabled us to escape some of the queues boarding the electric trams, it was expensive and a little rushed. So, the attraction itself is wonderful, just be careful if you are booking a guided tour."
,,Excellent experience anyone can receive in Singapore,5.0,,place is just 40 minutes away from City and place where you can receive excellent experience and quite good attraction is received to the place even when anyone come to Singapore. but sometimes its bit boring when the animals are not there when they go to sleep or another.
,,Up close and personal with the animals,5.0,,"This was a really cool ride through the zoo at night time to see all the wild animals outside of their cages. It was a very unique experience. It did sadden me a little that they were chained up but I understand that this is just for the couple of hours during the night safari. Overall, great experience and glad we did it. Well worth the price."
,,Nice night out,4.0,,"This was a good night out. We were fortunate that most animals were easy to see. There are both walking tracks & a tram tour & both are worth doing as you see completely different animals. We arrived at 7:30 & had dinner there first, (not cheap) then stayed at the park till it closed at midnight."
,,Better to go earlier than later,5.0,,"Others have mentioned that this is an excellent attraction and I agree. The area is quite large, so you may want to get there early to cover as much ground as possible. The ticket price is not insignificant, so you'll want to maximise your enjoyment of it by not tiring yourselves out before going there. You can choose to move around on foot and at certain stops, you can board the trams, which come with English-speaking guides. My friend and I went there after a hectic day of sightseeing. We ran out of steam after some walking, and took in the rest of it with the help of the tram, but, considering how much we paid, I wished we could have explored on our own a little more!

I recommend it to all visitors to Singapore."
,,Too much Hype about Nothing,1.0,,Supposedly a must do for all tourists but I feel there is too much hype about the night safari. If you don't have anything useful to do and want to KILL YOUR TIME ....then go for it.
,,Name it Indian Night Safari,4.0,,"They should rename this place as Indian Night Safari instead of NIght Safari. The places is just 40 minutes away from the city. Very well organized & managed. Healthy animals. They have a toy train which travels slowly & you can get down & board at different places. Most of the animals they have are from Indian. Felt silly as an Indian, that you travel from India to Singapore & watch all Indian animals. Lot of good restaurants inside the park. A must visit, if you are going along with kids."
,,"The night Safari is great, but getting on the tram is a bit chaotic",3.0,,We (family of 5) did the night safari. It opens at 7:30 pm and at that time there was already a long line for the tram that goes around all animals. The whole process of getting on the tram was a bit chaotic. When you're on the ride is very nice. you can also walk around and that's really nice. Because most people only take the tram you have most of the walks to yourself. I would advice starting with a walk or two and getting on the tram when the initial chaos is over.
,,A must visit if you ever visit Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of places you should visit if you go to Singapore. It is the only zoo where you can see animals at bight. Fascinating, The children ejoyed every moment of it."
,,night safari,5.0,,Look i am not a huge zoo fan but what you must do at the Singapore Zoo is the night safari its pretty amazing with the fire show in the beginning ! you travel around in what they call trams but they are like carts hitched together its so much fun and the food is fabulous all made to order and you east under cover !!!
,,Pleasant Evening out if you love nature,5.0,,"Absolutely pleasant trip if you love nature. Nocturnal animal roaming free in a well designed space while you are walking through the path, or siting on a shuttle train through the safari. Large fruit bats hanging down from the branch if you are brave enough to walk under the tree. Huge Amazon fish in an aquarium added on to the thrill of the night."
,,One of the must see in Singapore,4.0,,One of the very well maintained and planned zoo I have come across so far. Children will love this place. Also it has a small water park for kids so one should carry some spare clothes for kids. Also they can be accompanied by adults. There are various animals shows here hence one should plan the day accordingly. The map and the show schedule is easily available on their website. One of the best show is the splash safari which is at 5 in the eve. The staff is helpful. Also do remember to buy a tram ride along with ur entry ticket as the park is really big and u might need a tram ride to go from one location to the other.
,,Great with tour company,4.0,,"We did the night safari with tour company Tour East.
We had a buffet dinner on arrival which had a huge range of food and sweets.
Then received priority boarding due to being on the tour which meant we skipped the huge line for the tram ride which was great.
The tram goes quiet fast but the commentary was very informative.
We did one of the walks but I would recommend all as you get to see animals that are missed on the tram ride.
Definitely recommend the experience and glad we decided to do it. I would recommend doing it with Tour East because of the huge wait times experienced for the tram which I feel would dampen the experience."
,,3rd Visit Better Than The 1st Two,4.0,,"Went on a Saturday night. The first two visits were made when my children were much younger where we had to skip the walking trails and had to head directly to the tram rides. Now that they were slightly bigger, decided to do the walking trails and the experience was so much better.

Visitors may want to check the weather forecast to be sure of clear skies. We were fortunate that the moon was full the night we went. Hence, a clear and bright night. We reached the park at around 8pm. Skipped the fire-eating performance since we've watched that before. First time visitor should not miss this entertaining show. And don't miss the Creatures By The Night show too! Do check out the show times on their official website.

As we entered, we could see a large crowd of people queuing up for the tram rides. Heaved a sigh of relief cos that was never our intention this time.

Veered to the left to follow the Fishing Cat Trail, followed by the Leopard Trail and a few other trails. My family enjoyed all the trails especially the Wallaby trail. I think it would be helpful to familiarize yourself with the different trails by checking out the Night Safari website before going on the trip. You will be able to plan your trip better. And don't miss the lions and tigers-feeding time. 8pm for the lions and 9pm for the tigers. Both are at different trails, so you've got to plan your walk well. The felines are at their most active state during feeding times, I think!

We tried to avoid any big groups as you will find your view blocked. Moreover, big groups tend to talk very loudly, scaring the animals away.

At the end of all the walking which was around 9.15pm, we went back to the entrance of the park, to take the tram. That's the best time to take the tram rides cos there were no long queues. We enjoyed the breeze as the tram took us to different routes to enjoy the sights and sounds that we may have missed during our walk. And we were so excited when we listened to the howling of the wolves as we passed by their den. Such a thrill for city kids like us!

Took about 40 minutes to complete the ride. Rushed out to grab a drink at the eateries around. Had the intention to have a quick bite but alas, no halal-certified food to eat. Maybe the management can do something about this. However, for those who can order their meal, you have to do it before 10pm cos apparently,their last order is at 10pm. Such a letdown since the park closes at 12mn.

Overall, a wonderful experience minus the lack of available meal for us. And, not forgetting that the experience was made more wonderful with the friendly staff and guides around the park and on the tram ride. Thumbs up to all of them. We are going again soon."
,,Must See,5.0,,"One of the best zoo I had visited so far. Open style of keeping the animals is really amazing. The river safari experience is also good. Over all a place which one should not miss while visiting Singapore. All those who are not very keen animal lovers can avoid Night Safari (part of Zoo), but those who love animals must carry night vision goggles and the camera should be able to click photos in the dark as 'Flash photography"" is not allowed."
,,Best experience,5.0,,"Always loved going to Night Safari, it's nice to see the animals in their 'nature' hours where they are more active. Recommended"
,,Really enjoyed,4.0,,"Really enjoyed our evening here. There was a queue for the trams however unlike other reviewers we didn't spend longer queueing than on the tram. We enjoyed the parts of the walking trails that we did, I think they really added to the trip. I might have been a little underwhelmed if we had just done the tram but with the trails as well, fabulous."
,,Get up close with lots of animals,5.0,,"I dont think there is many places in the world where you can get within 2 meters (sometimes closer) to such a wide range of animals from bats to 3m crocodriles with a shallow trench in between or nothing at all.
This is really a unique experience.
Tip, as it gets really busy, do the walking trail first and wait until the last tram ride for a short queue."
,,Big Disappointment,1.0,,"Where to begin? The queue for the tram was longer than the tram ride itself. It was very dark and very hard to see the animals. All we saw were different types of deer, cattle, a few dogs, some flamingos, the Asiatic Lions and an Asian Elephant (the best thing of the whole evening). Most of the animals were lying down and resting, which made it difficult to actually see them. I also think I saw a black bear sleeping on a rock, but I'm not sure. We drove by many enclosures, but I did not see any animals. After the tram ride, we walked back to see if we could see the Malayan Tiger, but it was no where to be seen in the enclosure. I was expecting to see nocturnal animals. Animals that are active at night. The Night Safari did not deliver, save your $$."
,,A splendid night,4.0,,"We came to Night Safari right after the Zoo and what a difference, we took the tram upon arriving and truly enjoyed the tram ride. Awesome to be so close to the animals and the tram even stop for animals to cross over. The show is entertaining and my boys really enjoyed themselves........"
,,"very nice, want to go again",4.0,,"When you like walking it is possible, it's Like walking in rainforest. With the train you don't see everything. You can see most animals very good. Clean Park."
,,Extremely disappointing,1.0,,"The most hyped destination in Singapore... I don't know why people swear by this place. We happened to visit this place on a Sunday evening and the queue was so long tht the waiting time to get to the tram was much longer than the actual tram ride. And what was so special about the animals?? 5 types of deer, 5 types of cattle.....only exception was the White African Lion...
Post the so called 40 minutes tram ride, was the show 'creatures of the night' which was another sheer waste of time. Am sure there are better things to do when in Singapore and Night Safari is surely not one of them."
,,amazing,4.0,,"although i have visited this place a couple of times earlier as well...but my kids have always enjoyed the experience...i would rather rate the chiang mai night safari far more exhilarating.....but nevertheless its a beautiful experience esp if u walk on foot to the various trails....there were some animals missing because of maintanance and up gradation, i still enjoyed the overwhelming experience , of seeing the animals kept in an over protected and superb environment.."
,,"novel, but be prepared for disappointment if you have high expectation",2.0,,"definitely a unique concept and experience, especially if you want to see how creatures are at night.

be prepared though to view the creatures as if you are peeping upon them, as the viewing areas are generally restricted. this is understandly so- although frustrating- so that the animals are minimally disturbed.

alas, the animals no longer display much of their 'nocturnal instinct' anymore especially the predators e.g. the tigers, lions, wild cats, hyenas, etc., since they are pretty well-fed. thus, do forgo the 'feeding' of the lions and tigers; small token meat were pretty much shot out into the enclosure of those magestic cats. both the lions and tigers were simply sitting at the spot where the meat would land, and they would eat if they feel like it. the rest of the animals, like the leopard, pangolin and binturong were just sleeping around, after a well-fed day perhaps?

a few years back, i remember there were more species to see. i thought i saw anteater, sloth back then (5-10 years ago perhaps?), but for my recent trip, i saw repeated displays.

most of the information panels are not properly functional, so be prepared to NOT learn much about the animals on display. do not expect to take much photos of the animals, as there is not much lighting. if you use flash or try to disturb the animals or stretch your limbs beyond the permitted points, be prepared to be lectured- instead of merely warned- by the staff who would then proceed to follow you as long as he or she could.

tips:
- be prepared to spend at least SGD50 per person (regardless adult or child) on zoo tickets + food
- buy tickets online to enjoy up to 30% discount depending on credit card
- skip the lion and tiger feeding sessions.... simply not worthy to crowd among the visitors to see token meat thrown to the animals
- take the walking trail first, then the tram ride (around 10pm) to see the rest of the zoo"
,,night safari an attraction!!!!!!!,4.0,,Zoo makes us thinks of animals. An ultimate safari ride makes you slowly go through the animals nearby and the end is with the marvelous animal show which makes you charged with the activities of the animals performing.
,,went on the night safari,4.0,,"Interesting perspective.enjoyed the tram ride, but do get off and see everything. Large bats, and flying squirrels were particularly interesting."
,,An eye opening disappointment,1.0,,"We went to experience this novel concept but regretted every minute of it.

There was no queue for the tickets when we got there, however people started queuing for something else which we eventually figured out to be for the tram ride. Once past the fire dancers, we got stuck in another massive queue, not dissimilar to a theme par, for ages whilst the first trams arrived; in the stifling heat with only some weak fans to cool people down. We did think of seeing something else first however we were on a tight schedule and didn't want to stay late at the zoo. We bypassed the animal show and we should've really left at that point and avoided the whole place...I mean come on, who really wants to see animals perform for entertainment these days?!

Once on the tram, families were being loud, people using camera flash when the guide clearly reminded everyone (ON HER MICROPHONE) and it really felt like we were herded cattle ourselves.

I found it convenient we saw a lot of the animals, poised and ready for show with ample lighting displaying their area. After seeing the lions, my husband and I didn't really enjoy the rest of the tour. We went on a small walking tour once the ride finished but whizzed around it as all we really wanted to do is was to leave.

Completely overpriced, too expensive to get via taxi (as they charge night rates) and by the sounds of it using public transport is a drag and although there is a strong element of education over endangered species, the whole experience was dreadful."
,,Change of pace,5.0,,"A rather unique time to visit and see nocturnal habits of animals especially those not normally seen during daylight hours. If you have the legs for it this is a natural adjunct to the day time visit. Stay and have a meal at a handy restaurant between the day and evening attractions,watch the fire eaters before you enter. A suggestion to walk first
then take the tram with commentary. This will give you a tranquil walk to start with to view the animals quietly.
Certainly to be highly recommended for the innovative lighting and layout."
,,Great concept but experience could have been better,3.0,,"I have three key points for the tourist - 1. Arrive early, 2. Arrive early, 3. Arrive early. Once inside the Night Safari there are four trails to walk and a nonstop tram tour - the tourist can opt for the trails only or for both. As there is a limited number of trams, patrons can wait standing for a very long time in a very long line. (The tram ride appears to be a compulsory first activity, if undertaking a tram tour). The tram tour takes approximately 40 minutes to complete and on my trip animals were visible in most displays areas. If walking the trails, a torch would be handy and be prepared with a map - the lights and signage in many places is not as good as it should be. A general fitness level is required as the trail (four sections) takes about an hour to walk, has uneven surfaces and has a couple of hilly sections. There is a reasonably priced food and drink shop about half way along the trail. There is also a dining area with cafés and bars at the main entry where there is a show arena. If you have visited the day zoo then the Night Safari will be different as it is held in a different section of the zoo with its own separate entry and animals. The experience was novel and provided a chance to see a number of nocturnal animals that don't do much during the daylight hours. Accessing the site is easy via tours, taxi, public transport. On our Friday night visit there were plenty of taxis (additional charges apply at night), limousines (in excess of $50), public transport (about $3 to city centre, takes just over an hour by bus then MRT train) and charter bus companies offering $3 seats to various hotels. We opted for the latter option. The zoo is worth a visit, but be prepared for a possible long wait to undertake the tram tour."
,,Great tour,4.0,,Night Safari was excellent. It was really busy when we went. The price wasn't too bad either plenty of eating places there.
,,Unsatisfactory visit to the Night Safari,2.0,,"Took 6 foreign friends to visit what I thought was still the best night attraction in Singapore. What a shock! The standard has dropped drastically. Firstly, the crowd management was bad. Tour group leaders were seen to lead their group and ""jump q"" causing happiness with others that were in line. On that evening, the wait was about 1.5hrs.

We wanted to stop at the fist walking trail but the tram didn't stop. The whole tram ride was over in 30 minutes. I was telling my friends how close you can get to the animals on these walking trails and that was the highlight.

I an totally disappointed with the recent visit and I would not go there again. I how the management will do something to improve the situation."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"Just amazing !!! Took 1 hour from the start to end of queue - once you enter the tram, the amazing experience begins!! The animals and the environment simply wonderful"
,,Nice Animals - and a lot of tourists,3.0,,Not the first place I would go but OK if you like wild animals and have some time to spare. Also: Book a tour with transfer or take a taxi - public transportation will take a while (from downtown)...
,,Night Safari with Tour East,4.0,,"Great tour with Tour East with priority entry leaving the tour running seamlessly. Would be great to start an hour earlier to enable more time to do the walk to the really interesting animals ie the big cats. Linda was a brilliant guide, welcoming, inclusive & funny"
,,Interesting Experience,5.0,,"We did the night safari on the night we landed in Singapore i.e. 15th May 2015, we did not go reading any reviews or having any preconceived notions, having said that we knew that it was something which we should not miss while in Singapore.
Truly the experience was remarkable, the show starts around the dusk time and as there was decent crowd which had lined up for safari rides we went for the live show first. It was an open air auditorium with lights focused only on the podium and we had animals who were well trained coming and showcasing their talent.
An air of excitement prevailed all around and the trainers and MC did a wonderful job. The most hair raising thing was when an audience member was called and the team asked the person to handle a python on his shoulder all alone, not many I am sure can do this, however we had a not so heavily built Chinese man who was randomly chosen from the audience who withstood those tense seconds.
Overall a great show. Post that we lined up and sat in open tram / jeep normally houses around 50 - 60 people in one trip with each row accommodating 3 - 4 people. We went through the jungle path on well developed road and saw the majestic animals from very close quarters it was truly an awesome experience and I must admit if we had missed this it would have been bad on our part. We had our dinner in their only, luckily could find Indian buffet with good variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food including Indian breads.
Anyone going to Singapore on a holiday must definitely be here."
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,A truly unique experience. Had to queue for 30 minutes for the tram ride following the animal show but was really worth it. A good 45 minute tram ride with some animals free roaming in certain areas. Just something really special to see.
,,What an experience!,4.0,,Never have I experienced seeing these sorts of animals in the night and this was absolutely fantastic to see. There is loads to do and loads to see!!! One of the things that I loved most is how everything was made to look like there normal habitat!!! Did not look like enclosures at all and you felt one at nature!!! Only thing I will say is some of the animals were difficult to see yet let's face it. It was a night safari! Well worth a look! Going to see the zoo in the day tomorrow :D
,,Visit to the Night Safari,3.0,,We recently visited Singapores night safari which we found slightly dissppointing as a lot of the animals were difficult to see as it was dark. The ride on the road train was informative and some animals were able to be seen in all it was worth a visit but don`t expect it to be as good as a visit in daylight.
,,Interesting experience....sanitised attempted at a safari,4.0,,"It is incredibly busy when opening with multiple tour groups and large family groups flood in, which can be over whelming and like a flash mob. I spent 45mins queueing at opening time for the tram, which led to a 45 min trip around the main exhibitions. Some were hard to see, others less so. Several walking trails each 20mins long allow you to get closer, it can feel eerie at night with low lighting and not many people about .... especially after the bat house.

It attempts to be a safari for people who didn't wasn't to leave Singapore."
,,Best place for kids,5.0,,My kids really loved it. Everytime we go to Singapore we visit night safari because its different everytime you go only thing is the show they have to do something better than that its always the same.The best place for kids.
,,This is pretty special,5.0,,Singapore zoo offers a unique lens into a zoo that most people will rarely encounter. The night safari was something different to the offering of other zoos. The animals appeared healthy and well and there was a variety of animals to explore. It is not as commercial as some zoos and did not feel like it was exploiting the creatures it promoted. Worth a visit but don;t even think about eating there. Go to Little India first and get a cab to the zoo with the money you save.
,,Experience of its kind,5.0,,"We experienced the Night Zoo watching for the first time. Though we clubbed it with Zoo due to time constraint, it can be viewed separately to avoid tiredness. Trails were well secured. Zoo officials were there to help. Trams were also available easily. If you are using public transport then don't waste time, so that last bus and last train from MRT station could be caught. Worth visiting."
,,Great time at Night Safari,5.0,,We were picked up by a tour group at our hotel. Tickets were given to us by the driver when we arrived. Got on the tram very quickly and really enjoyed that trip. The tram went slowly and the commentary told us exactly what we were seeing. The meals area had a good variety of food. We had an Indian dish which was reasonably priced and enjoyable. The fire show was disappointing and we left half way through it. Then wandered through the trails until it was time to get our coach back.
,,Good but long wait to get in,4.0,,"Though we had to wait very long in the line ( 1 h15) to get in, we were happy about this experience. But they need to improve a few things such as find ways to reduce the waiting time . Once you get in the tram , the trip itself is quite short, , there is no stop , the tram just carry on. No possibility to take any pictures and some animals could not be seen."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Wild animals come and roar Roaming around freely to explore The wilderness that’s ferocious and savage Never flash your cameras to prevent some wreckage
,,Good night out for families,4.0,,"Even though we have done many zoos and wildlife experiences over the years, this was something different. Was well worth it and 3 boys (12,12,14) all enjoyed it. We arrived at 7.30 pm on a weekday. I would recommend doing the tram first even though there is a queue (we waited around 20 mins) then the fire show followed by walking trails - we did the fishing cat and leopard trails. There is plenty of food options but some not great quality and all very expensive - would eat beforehand if you want a good value healthier meal. Didn't do the animal show as queue too long and didn't want to waste 30 mins lining up. Overall would recommend as a good fun family night out !"
,,No Way!,5.0,,"I have never been to a zoo quite like this before. In recent years I find myself going ocne in awhile but not all that often.

I am from Ontario and thusly am familiar with ""African Lion Safari"", ""Marineland"", ""Zooz"" and other attractions like this one.

I steered away from it as I got older I saw them as unimpressive after seeing so many as a young child. I also live on a farm back home so that sort of takes away from the awe of some Zoo attractions.

However, one trip to Singapore Night Safari changed my outlook on a lot of things regarding zoos (especially zoos and sanctuaries in SE Asia). We had been walking all day, we were tired and above all we were only staying in Singapore for a short period of time. The Safari was not something we stuck to as a must-see, but in the end we said, ""Why not?"" and darn glad we did.

the Safari is not hard to get to at all, in fact, it is a relatively pleasant and interesting ride on the city bus that gives you a chance to see the city at night and part of the city you cannot walk through unless you have directions and time to do so (not to mention energy).

Singapore is a lively city but not overly exhausting or bumping, on a regular night, its not a bad place to just take a stroll, nor is it the place that influences you to drink heavily all the time. A night to the Safari can be just what the travel agent ordered and might actually/could actually be a place that you find inspiring.

There are a number of different routes to visit the animals in the Safari, it stretches from hiking trails to carting tours. We were tired, it was late, we carted...obviously we would have hiked...if we hadn't done all that walking :P

The animals are right there, we thought our buddy was going to get mauled by a sloth bear until the fella with the microphone said they are harmless.

There are literally no cages, if there is a deep dark secret to this zoo I wouldn't be surprised. How can they have so many living creatures with such extraordinary dossiers in such an open and diverse environment? It really was so much more than we could have expected. That goes without saying they laid out the park well, they put many of the more familiar and easier to visit creatures at the beginning of the tour at which point the time going by makes you wondering if you can get your money back. But after you become a non-believer in this event, you are taken back by it all when you see the diversity of the zoo's ecosystem.

Truly an amazing experience and one for the whole family. They have a photo spot to get your picture taken with the family or friends, etc. the lines are not too hectic although plan your times out right so you are not the last on your tram line...

The stores are quite endearing, in the sense that they certain make you feel good when you are buying things because they are all geared towards gifts for folks as well as a cool few shops of fashionable goods.

Food is expensive, they have bar products as well as a sweet fire show with gorgeous fire throwers!

iIt cost just under 50 SGD I believe for admission; totally worth it."
,,animals,5.0,,Aleways love the zoo and this time did night visit.. Prefer the day as could see more but nught time worth a do once. Guide was sooo funny and really enjoyed peering at the animals at night.
,,Zoo at night,3.0,,"Nothing great, just OK. Hardly a 45 min ride in their buses. Nice concept, but a very routine kind of an experience. Had to wait more in the queue than the time spent inside. The fire show at the entrance was more thrilling"
,,Night Safari at the Zoo,4.0,,The variety of animals were very good and attractive. The animal show and journey through different animal enclosures by the train was very good. Fire show at the end and the night safari was altogether excellent.
,,Too touristy,4.0,,20 years ago I visited zoo for the first time. For it was the best zoo on earth. This time wie did the night safari and it was very touristy. Lining up 40 min for the train and getting shot by some pretending to be funny photographers was a bit annoying. The trip with The train though was nice but not that impressiv as my visit 20 years ago.
,,Waste of our time,1.0,,"We arrived to at least 100 people lined up for Tram ride so went to see Creatures of the Night show instead. We waited there with about 50 people which grew for an hour whilst everyone finished the tram ride and lined up for the show also. Immediately after the last tram load lined up, show cancelled. So we wasted a 45 min taxi ride and 1 hr lining up to effectively see nothing but hundreds of angry tourists.
Attached is a picture of the crowd for your benefit."
,,Not that great. ....,2.0,,"Not up to the mark. , The hip given to the night safari was too much not much to see , very short trip, very few animals, can only spend an hour not more than that. ... i felt zoo was better option than night safari. ...can miss."
,,"Definitely Good but, could be better",4.0,,"This was a experience I had been wanting to do for years. I had heard it was awesome. We chose to take a shuttle to the zoo, great idea, much cheaper than getting a taxi. Arrived at 6.30pm, entry is not until 7.30pm, which we knew. We decided to have a drink whilst waiting $13.00 dollars for a Tiger beer! I think a bit rich. We decided to walk the trails first then take the Tram ride from near the Zebra Restaurant. The Tram ride was disappointing, the only time they came to a complete stop was at the lion enclosure. Next to me was a little boy who had trouble seeing the animals and by the time we could point them out, we had passed by. Forget trying to take photos. My strong suggestion to the organizers is to slow the tram ride and to stop at least at some of the main enclosures such as the elephant, hippo, buffalo. Pleased to have done it, but won't go back."
,,Fun & Efficient Visit!,4.0,,Arrived at the park shortly after it opened at 7:30 p.m. and we spent a little over 3 hrs there. Food is expensive so we ate first before heading over. We learned from past experience to avoid weekends and to ride the tram last. The tram is the first thing everyone queues for and although the lines do keep moving they are still very long! We started with the walking trail and finished that in a little over an hour. We then had about 15 minutes before the start of the 9:30 p.m. show which wrapped up at about 9:55 p.m. We hopped on the tram (no line-up) for the last 30 -40 min. or so. The last tram runs after 11:00 p.m. so it's definitely not a must do at the beginning of the night. It was an enjoyable family night out.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One of the most unique safari's you will ever find. Suggested by a colleague to visit this place and was not disappointed. An open train taking you through the various parts of the ""jungle"". From the exterior to the manner in which the animal enclosures have been maintained is worth a sight.Without giving much away, this place is a must visit for couples and kids."
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,"First experience of a wild night safari
Pls ensure you are there arnd 6.30 to get yourself available for the animal shows lined up at 7.30 onwards
So b early buy your ticket along with bird Park to save cost
Also taxi getting can be a bit of pain so Pls pre-book using phone than waiting

Awesome to see wild animals like tigers, lion and others in without cages while u pass them on train

Can't take pics as flashes not allowed so don't bother carrying normal camera.. Handycam better option

Take some souvieneir back We took the toucan statue...."
,,Select your own way to visit the wildlife,4.0,,"I went to the Night Safari with my husband in May 2015. And it's really a wonderful experience.
First, the location is good. We went to River Safari in the afternoon and follow by Night Safari, which just few hundred meters apart.

Secondly, you can select your way to get close to the animal of 7 regions on foot via the 4 special designed trials : fishing cat trail; leopard trail; East lodge trail and wallaby trail. Each trail takes around 20-25 mins. Or you can ride on the night tram instead which the guide will explain more for you. Japanese and Mandarin guide are provided upon booking.

Tips: since everyone want to get on the tram and the queue is very long all the time. You can go through the fishing cat trail and leopard trail, then, get on the tram at the middle stop and finish the 2nd half of your journey.

Thirdly, there are over 2500 creatures, you can see the big animals like elephant, hippo, lion, tiger, leopard, buffalo; also those small one like Asian otter, flying fox, slow loris and tarsier.

Lastly, don't miss the creatures of the night show. The animals in the performance are not that common. It's really interesting and exciting.

P.S. The food in the park are nice"
,,"Tame, long queues, good infrastructure.",3.0,,"This is good if you have kids with you. All have travelled to the Masai Mara and Kruger national park and those are real jungles with animals in them. This felt like a zoo but was built in an interesting manner. The fact that it is a night safari, you don't get to see all the animals because some might be camouflaged. There are a couple of walling trails which we did not do but were recommended to see the animals close. The animals basically sat there as we rode a tram past them. Singapore zoo would be a better option because Jere you can see the animals in the day, you can see plenty more animals, and you can spend as much time seeing them as you like. With the tram ride, which lasts 40 mins after a wait time of 45 mins, I didn't have the inclination to stand in queue again. I would recommend skipping if you have gone to the Zoo in Singapore."
,,Too many people!,3.0,,"We arrived an hour before it opened. We along with everyone else thought we would have dinner there. Lots of places, but no where to sit. Huge lines to get in. No sense of lines either, and when you wouldn't let people cut in front of you they would get angry. We were told to go to a show first since the lines to the tram was so long. Show was ok. Then the line to the tram was only about 45 minutes long. We were told to take the seats right behind the driver. No foot room, and couldn't see. There is one stop where we had to fight with the people to get a better seat. Yes the animals were close, but it would have been better to stay at the Singapore zoo longer. There is a nice restaurant inside where there were very few people, but you can't get there until the Night Safari opens and then the lines are so long, it is no wonder they had very few patrons."
,,Wildlife is calling!!,4.0,,"I did enjoy the night safari, there are many shows are provided. I walked around the safari with my friend, it was an interesting adventure.

Unfortunately, it was too dark for me. I thought there were some invisible animals since I saw nothing except the darkness and sleeping animals."
,,What a concept!!!,4.0,,"WOW just WOW!!! I took the family on this adventure not sure what to expect but was so impressed. The tram ride is a must as it gives you a highlight tour of the place so you know where to go back to. Whilst it is a long shuttle ride from the centre of town, it is what it is."
,,Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"We did the night time trip, you do get up close to the animals in a very controlled and safe environment, it is nice that you can get off and on different transport, go for a walk and re-join again.
The guides are very funny people who do help the enjoyment of the zoo.
If you get the chance go."
,,Better than the Zoo!,5.0,,I really enjoyed the night safari. It had been a cool day so all the animals were out. Would recommend doing the walking parts first and then the safari trip. Each has a separate queue when entering the park and some people had joined the safari one an hour and a half before the place even opened. This confused us a bit as we managed to walk straight it at opening time via the other entrance and when done join a shorter queue for the safari park. Great evening out.
,,something different and unique,4.0,,My partner was visiting and we had free passes to use so thought we try and we both enjoyed it very much. It is such a unique experience and the nocturnal animals were interesting compared to just visiting any zoos in the world. Definitely recommend if you are in Singapore for a short trip and worth the time.
,,A world class experience!,4.0,,"The Night Zoo is an amazing experience! The animals seem so close and so many interesting creatures from the region, not seen in many overseas zoos.
A truly magical night out. Do not be put off by the queues at the start, they move very quickly and you are swept into a great experience."
,,Excellent Evening Adventure,4.0,,"A very unique experience! It is certainly worth the cost of admission. Since it is dark, it is sometimes hard to see the animals and take pictures since flash is prohibited. Wish they have a bit more lighting in the animal areas to get a better view. We certainly enjoyed the experience and would recommend it. I would go a little earlier the next time and see the zoo itself and then stay for the night safari."
,,loved it!,5.0,,"We loved the night safari. If you are short on time and can either go to the zoo or the night safari, pick this. It was amazing. The tram meandering its way through dark forests and spotting the mighty lions, elephants and deer in the dark was exciting. Kids will love it"
,,Very enjoyable but can get busy.,4.0,,"Having been to the Night Safari two years ago we were very excited to be going back with our 15 month old and wider family. We started off with the animal show and were actually disappointed this time round. The show was half the time it was the first time we went and fewer, not so exciting animals with not very informative commentary. I wish we had skipped this and allowed more time for the walking trails.
The tram ride is good but the queues were extremely chaotic with tour groups jumping the queue, swapping around and quite deliberately pushing us out of the way which was not a nice experience.
The highlight is the walking trail which I would recommend not missing out. There is the opportunity to spend time to stop and look at the animals which the tram ride does not allow. Overall the time goes quickly and you should be prepared to be there until closing at midnight if you want to fit everything in."
,,Like an adventure in the dark,4.0,,"Its good because its unique. However, left us wanting for more. Its dark and so its difficult to take pics. They also advise you not to take pics with flash so its pointless trying anyway as its too dark.
Lots of trams unlike at the Zoo and River Safari so its easier to get around. They are a bit better organised as well with plenty attendants. Some good shows like the flame throwers, animal show etc. Tiger and Lion feeding is only on certain days. The Tiger and Lion did look a tad small too.
Overall you can take the effort to see this one. Refreshments and restaurants around but be aware they are at touristy prices."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Must visit place in Singapore. The overall experience is very good. The shows (fire show and nocturnal animals show ) are good. The tram ride is amazing. my 4yr old daughter enjoyed it a lot.
,,Worthwhile expenditure of time and money,4.0,,"Located at the northern part of Singapore, it is accessible by public transports as well as tour vans and cars. I arrived there around 7.20pm and they have lots of parking space available. Normally you'll find yourself paying 8 SGD for the parking fees as it is the maximum they can charge you. I went there on a Saturday night and it is full of people on the entrance. Luckily the queue just took us around 15-20 minutes. As you enter the safari, the people are way lesser unless you're queuing for the show (I'm not sure why). So it is best to reach there at 7pm on weekends, on weekdays it should be fine. Booked the tickets online and you'll enjoy a discount of 15%. There's no need to collect tickets, just show the tickets in your phone at the entrance. Once you're inside, you'll have a choice to go for the walking tours first or to queue for the tram. There will be an animal show for every hour starting from 7.30pm onwards which is only on Friday, Saturday and eve of Public Holidays. I would suggest to queue for the shows earlier to get optimum seating position at the centre. The whole trail will take you around 2 hours to complete. Some uphill walking is required. The animals are cute and lively. The will be lesser people to queue for tour on the tram when it is approaching 9.30pm. I would recommend this night safari for those who love wildlife or trying to find something new to do.

Tips: Bring umbrella, mosquito repellent, low-light-capabled camera, handheld fan (if you're afraid of heat)"
,,Unique decades ago and yet has the buzz,4.0,,Night Safari was a unique attraction that SIngapore cam up with to attract the Tourist dollar. It was unique then and even today packs in the crowds. It is unique and a great hit with families and tourists alike. One should fit it in if one has not been there before. Weekends are exceptionally crowded though - beware of the long lines.
,,NIght Safari,5.0,,Night Safari is the best! If you want to see animals in their own habitat and not in cages…this is the place to visit! I've been several times and very much intend to go again when I am in Singapore!!
,,"Exciting, warm, and busy",4.0,,"I went to the night safari after visiting the Singapore zoo
I was tired but excited as everyone talks about the night safari
My first impression was they have invested a lot to get this right
It was packed. I had a bite to eat before venturing in. Don't eat before the gates open as their is food places galore once inside ( i never knew this and had stuffed myself I case their was a sudden famine at Kentucky fried chicken outside the Singapore zoo before I went in) my partner then saw the food stalls and decided chips were not enough
Their were people everywhere!
The music started and the fire dancers ( masculine men) mmm my camera went zoom and I was transfixed the animals would have to wait .......
This went on for half an hour
My sore feet disappeared for this
Ok the lines began people everywhere queuing ( I hate queuing)
After 15 min we boarded a train on wheels ( a long safari train painted in black and white)
Then we were off at a snail pace with a loud microphone explaining the animals in their habitat
It was good I wanted a lion to jump out and add to some of the excitement
Their were opportunities to get off the safari train and walk in to the night ( it was dark and see the lions etc up closer I jumped out and remembered my sore feet)
No one else jumped out and I saw more food venues which were empty
Maybe it was just too hot
After a hour and a half we ventured back to hundreds of people everywhere
We had to get a red bus back to our hotel it was crazy busy at after 10pm at night
We found our bus and sat up top in the night air and relaxed going back into singapore"
,,Unlike any other zoo!,4.0,,"I like unique things and experiences and this was certainly that! You go only at night, because all the animals here are nocturnal! There are several routes to take through the park and lots to see, but what really gets you is taking the tram through the park and suddenly realizing that there are some VERY large nocturnal creatures watching your every move! It's fascinating and one of those things I'll never forget. The only bummer was I couldn't take pictures because I didn't have a low light camera. There are lots of souvenirs for purchase though, which was nice."
,,Animals at their nocturnal best,4.0,,"The only night safari in the world as they claim, but for sure. A must visit. Start your journey with the enthralling Fire show and then move on to the show of the night creatures. Post which start your tram journey to see one of the best congregation of nocturnal creatures in the world. I would also recommend the walking trails as well, as in which case you are able to see the animals from a much closer distance. Enough food options are available, however Bongo Burgers is highly recommended"
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,"We went on a Sunday night so not sure if my experience was typical of the attraction. The place was over crowded and very hot. Your your gets you there about 620 but it doesn't open until 7 so you queue for 40 minutes before you move, then you queue for an hour Disneyland style for another before you get on the train. It it crazy hot and the mostly sub continental crowd push in. Once you get on the ride you pass by a variety of animals but it's pot luck if they are visible and or moving.

The ride takes about 40 minutes then you can watch a small trained animal show which was average. There is also a walk to go on but your bus leaves before you would finish it so you don't go. The fire show is ok for 5 Minutes but that's it. Food and drink prices are through the roof so eat first or take your own $15 for a beer $10 for a service station hot dog. Tour prices seem to be $58 which is 33 for entry and 25 for transport makes for an expensive family night.
In summary it's ok but not great"
,,Interesting animals you don't normally get to see,4.0,,"The reason I originally wanted to do the Night Safari was the binturong (Asian bearcat). I had seen one in the movie ""We bought a zoo"" and wanted to see one in real life ever since. I was not disappointed - he was the first animal on stage for the Creatures of the Night show.

I found the Night Safari really interesting... to traipse around in the dark, spotting many animals you'd never get to see otherwise, was good fun. Tip: it's better to walk through the various trails while all the other visitors make a dash for the tram, and then to do the tram afterwards, once the queue has dissipated.

I reckon a lot of the negative reviews here are by people who didn't bother walking to the exhibits you can't see from the tram. If you only do the tram, you'll likely think the Night Safari is expensive and not worthwhile. Just my opinion!

Highlights included the binturong (of course), the squeaky (smelly) but gorgeous and rather hyperactive otters, the clouded leopard and Asian fishing cat.

Don't expect great photos unless you have a fast lens and a tripod - no flash photography is allowed as it can blind the animals. Of course, there were loads of silly tourists who used their flashes anyway (despite ""no flash"" being translated into about 12 different languages), but it was nice to see the zoo staff actually stop the tram at one point to politely get one particularly stubborn woman to quit using her cell phone's flash.

The only disappointments were the size of the big cat enclosures (too small, in my opinion) and the fact that the binturong could not be spotted in his own enclosure when we passed it after the Creatures of the Night Show. Otherwise, it was great.

All in all, something interesting, educational and a little bit different to try while in Singapore."
,,Fun at night safari,5.0,,Another must to visit place in Singapore. Half day needed for the trip. Worth for all ages. Very unique animals seen. Overall great value for money.
,,Experience it is,4.0,,"Depends on how much familiar you are with animal habitats. If not much, this night safari is an experience to have. You might be able to spot most nocturnal and few day time animals in a small but seemingly natural habitat. i could not see the caged animals, but they were kept away from the humans by some depth or water barrier.
We took the train ride for about 40 minutes and it was interesting and fun. The highlight for us was the creatures of the night show - beautiful concept, message and excellently implemented and presented.
Must mention, there is some vegetarian Asian/Indian dinner buffer which tastes good."
,,"Night safari a must, zoo in beautiful setting",4.0,,"Great diversity of animals, seemed well taken care of. Free ranging orangutans were a hoot. River safari had interesting layout and great animals. Bait ride could be skipped. Zoo could haves more talks and info about its conservation efforts, if any."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Good fun, very informative and reasonably good value. Would be great for kids. If travelling by public transport, be careful to get away in time to get home. We got caught out when the train stopped unexpectedly at a station at 23:50 and were told it wasn't going any further."
,,We go to night safari n my daughter loves it so much,5.0,,"The animal in night time is still awake but not sleep, the show inside is good n interesting.

We left thee after 12am. There is bus to go city n we need to change taxi to out hotel. The transportation charge is expensive. Taxi driver suggested that we can use taxi directly if we have four people."
,,Night Safari Singapore- A Must See!,5.0,,This was a really fun excursion and for all ages! Very interesting to see so many nocturnal animals in their native habitat!
,,So not worth the money,1.0,,"Not much to say about this place, except that it feels like a waste of time and money.

42 dollars on a Friday night for 45 minutes of queue to the tram ride, and 40 minutes of quite boring tram ride in the dark. Saw a few interesting animals but nothing I will remember. When we got off the train at 9.30, there was no more queue! So remember to do the walks first and go on the tram ride later.

Walks are quite boring too. It is too dark so it is like going to the zoo in the dark. Should have saved the money to go to the zoo during the day instead."
,,nice but small,4.0,,"really nice experience, with entertaining and friendly staff. there is also a fire show (free) starts between 8 or 9 pm dnt miss it. there is no mrt , for the nearest mrt u hav to take a taxi. so its better to go by only taxi (25 to 30 sgd) or take a spl. bus from little india arcade ( clarq quay, orchard road etc ) 6sgd per person."
,,Thrilling Experience,5.0,,"Even for a person like me -- not much of a fan of zoos -- the Night Safari proved to be an unforgettable experience. The open tram carries visitors up close and past several breeds of wild animals, all living in what appears to be as close to their natural habitats as man can make them. We even saw a pride of lions, with the males standing guard in all their majesty, within a stone's throw.
The tram service is excellent.
We went with the RMG tour operators who did a commendable job of coordinating the visit for a diverse group of visitors.
The only negative was the lack of adequate signage and directions to move around, when we are allowed to walk the trails on our own. This is especially important since when one moves around with women and children the feeling of being lost in the midst of the dark forest with all the chilling sounds of the jungle around us can prove a bit scary. In fact, we came across several groups who were asking for the way -- mostly to the Exit!"
,,Enjoyable visit for everlong memory,5.0,,"Singapore night safari made me feel like I am in a forest with animals around and made me freighten too. Singapore's night safari is the world's first wildlife night- visit zoo. Very close view of many animals on board a tram with expert guides in the Tram Safari Adventure and the walking experience are the highlights. Added to this,
there was an interesting show by tribals which kept us enthralled."
,,Bad!,2.0,,Waste of money and I didn't particularly enjoy it. Too expensive for what it is. Didn't live up to its positive billing at all.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Make sure go there with insect spray beforehand. Better to go there by MRT and buses because of peak hours traffic. Enjoy the show by wild creatures!
,,Awesome expirence!!,3.0,,"We visited the zoo during the day and did the night safari that same night and boy what an experience!! Myself and my partner were mesmerised buy the animals not being behind fences and walls witch made the expire cd so much cooler! The tram ride is a must do witch must have gone for about 45min at least. It takes you around all the exhibits and animals in the park. But don't worry if you can't see them you can either get back on the tram and go again or you can access all of the exhibits buy foot! The park was very reasonably priced altho I forget how much exactly now. This is an absolute must do if you are into the outdoors and looking for something you can't do anywhere else, some little tips tho, mosquito repellent and good walking shoes."
,,Good but can be given a miss,3.0,,"Good experience for kids, can see animals live in a semi natural habitat... nice concept... but one cannot be sure to be able to see all the animals... the train is constantly moving, hence one needs to be vigilant or would miss sights... cant tk photographs... n d souvenir shop is just too expensive"
,,Very expensive for what it was,3.0,,"Granted we went on the Sunday night of a Long weekend but even though we already had tickets, we waited over 2 hours just to get to the front of the queue to get a tram ride. After this there was no time to see anything else which was disappointing given the amount of money we had spent.

I think it is quite unfair that bus loads of people seemingly jumped the queue. I understand that it was a long weekend and all but I think there could have been better traffic (visitor) management by the staff and it should be fair for all visitors.

We enjoyed the fire throwing show but this is all we saw apart from a few animals which were in the dark which you couldn't see all that well anyway. I felt like I was on the Jurassic Park tour, they are disappointed when they get to an enclosure expecting to see something and there is nothing to see which happened 3 times :(

They say you can take photos but no flash. I respect that flashes going off affects the animals etc but not one of my photos came out even though I had it on night setting. Perhaps it was because the tram operator just kept going through each enclosure and didn't stop so therefore you couldn't take a proper photo and it felt extremely rushed. Lucky there was a pushy salesperson at the end of the tram ride to try and sell us a very expensive digitised tourist photo so at least we had a photo of whatever animal they chose to put on the photo.

I was looking forward to this visit but I think my money could have been spent better somewhere else. Will I remember this experience, yes but unfortunately mostly for the wrong reasons :( I wish I could get a partial refund because I only had the opportunity to have a partial visit."
,,Just Awesome!!,5.0,,"This Safari was recommend to us by friends and after reading some reviews on here, we opted to pay the extra and do the Private Tour... and I'm soooo glad we did. Initally I thought that S$200 seemed quite expensive, but I'm so glad I spend the extra money, as it really turned into one of those special ""one off"" experiences. Firstly we got a Taxi from our hotel, which is fairly inexpensive and a convenient way to get there, as the Zoo is a little out of the city centre. We were escorted to the restaurant to enjoy the wonderful buffet dinner (included in cost) where the food was tasty with great variety, though the price of a beer is astronomical so perhaps stick to water!
We were then met by Walter, our fabulous guide, who ushered us past the hordes of people standing at the entrance line and we had a quick souvernier photo (also included) taken. We really felt like VIPs when we had a golf buggy all to ourselves and Walter spent the evening taking us through the entire zoo and explaining all about the different animals. We got to see all the animals, as we could stop off for longer at each exhibit and feeding the elephants was one of the highlights of the evening. Upon completion of the tour, we were given a little bag, which contained our Souvenir Photo and a couple of small stuffed animals. I can not recommend this tour more highly and would suggest when booking you ask for Walter, His gentle & genuine personality combined with his wealth of knowledge really made this a very special and memorable experience. If you love animals, do not miss this tour!"
,,a part of show,3.0,,"after a day in Zoo and after disappointing River safari, we have to see Night one. Between both you must stay in area and spent a money for shopping, food... There is some show in front of gate just at the same time when they open gates for first show, so choice is yours. Show with animals are short and nothing special, I noticed a very loud music, speakers, that must be influence with environment. Generally not bad organized, you will pass thru whole place by bus and after there is a few possibilities to walk. We walked all of them and generally same as you can see from bus. At the end only noise from show area and a few animals will be remembered. Too commercial, but from Singapore pirates expected."
,,Expensive for a night out,2.0,,Very overpriced. Not a lot of animals out. Chiang Mai night Safari was better. If you don't like crowds that push and shove you don't waste your time or money. Better things to see in Singapore
,,Nice place.,4.0,,If you are in Singapore definitely visit this place. There is a train ride that takes you to see different animals. It is at night so the feel is different. Creature of the night ahow also very nice. They are very helpful if u have have people who need special assistance or infants. There is also free wifi and some restaurants and of course the souvenir shop. Happy and welcoming staff.
,,Night Zoo a must.,4.0,,Just outside the city and unusual to offer a glimpse of nocturnal animals. Food as average as expected at such a large visitor attraction.
,,Interesting and fun,4.0,,Great setup. Lots to see. It will definitely takes up the whole evening. Very pricey though. Easily will cost you over 200SGD for 4 people for the evening.
,,Tourist trap,2.0,,Endless line of waiting to get into the night safari with foreigner everywhere that do not know how to live and do not care about their environment and the people around them. I would recommend about any zoo in Quebec more then this. Disappointed.
,,very cool!,5.0,,a must see when in Singapore! bring your bug spray and walking shoes. unlike any other zoo experience .
,,Pretty amazing zoo,4.0,,I went to the night show and went on a tram tour which was pretty cool. There are quite a few restaurants where you can eat inside which was pretty nice as well.
,,Hyped up,3.0,,"Good, but not great.

The night safari can be preferred over a daytime visit to the zoo.

The fire-eater show was entertaining

Very few vegetarian food options

Not many taxis available around the time night safari ends, but a few buses available

The trams help covering most of the zoo, but walking is more fun

The show with the sea lion was very entertaining"
,,Disappointing !,2.0,,"My husband and I were quite disappointed by the Night Safari. Upon reaching there, we first went for the animal show which got cancelled due to rain. Next we had to wait in queue for almost an hour for the tram ride, which was totally not worth it. Maybe we should have gone for the walking trails. Then we managed to secure seats for the next animal show, which we found to be a bit boring. Kids would probably enjoy such shows. Overall, a dissatisfying experience.."
,,I attended the Night Safari,4.0,,i ATTENDED THE NIGHT SAFARI IN IT. How amazing is to watch the animals at night. But it is overrated a little bit. it is not the first thing to do in Sngapore as recommended by many websites. maybe when you have a free night in your schedule you can go there.
,,No fences!,4.0,,"For the non-predators, but still! Just feet away from lumbering beasties. The trolley ride was comfy and a good mix of animals. This is definitely fun and worth doing!"
,,a queue safari,1.0,,"we happened to have night safari as a last item on our iternary.. and boy how wrong could we be..

first it was a saturday.. of the labour holiday weekend. our tour operator promptly dropped us before the night safari begun only for us to stand in a queue to enter the park. on the way while waiting in the queue,, we made the kids sit on our shoulders to watch the tribal dancers spit fire..nice show but too much crowd

our tour operator..wise guy.. had given us strict instructions.. to run for the tram ride.. but as destiny would want us.. we had to exit the queue to allow a child to attend natures call.. then we saw the first animal show.. which precisely had only 3 species of animals and the most lame show ever..

and then began the unending winding queue.. we waited for 2 hours.. and when we heard the tram ride is 40 min long.. we had no option but to quit the queue as we would have missed the pick up by our tour operator..

time was too short to go on a walking trail now.. and kids were too tired to walk.

what salvaged the remaining late evening was a gelato and the fire dance show .. mind u second time..

by the time we reached our hotel thru the saturday traffic..kids were asleep.. too tired to have dinner.. we called it a day too..

expensive tiring event.. but not regretting to miss out a couple of nocturnal animals.. we saw plenty at the zoo.."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"What a wonderfully unique experience it was!! Yes , visiting this attraction in singapore should be on each tourist's wishlist. In my opinion this experience is much much better than the zoo. To view animals at night time is a very unique & out of this world experience. The trails are well made and well marked. You get the feeling of exploring a forest as you walk around the zoo.

The trails get you up close to various night creatures such as the cereal, the cheetah , the binturang and the hyenas. Then the tram takes you all around with a wonderful commentary and you get to see the majestic Asian Rhino , the beautiful white lions and a variety of deers.
The creatures of the night show is entertaining as well as educational.
A not to be missed attraction in Singapore !!"
,,Best night out in a long time!,5.0,,"The title here is perhaps an atypical description of a zoo, but nothing about the night safari was what you'd expect.

We loved the effort that had been put in to ensure the animals were not caged, as you might expect. It really felt like they were in their natural habitats and with plenty of space to roam.

We took the tram to the first stop and then got off to follow the 'leopard trail' and we were not disappointed! We saw spotted and clouded leopards and a whole host of other animals. We spent most of the time exploring the walking trails, which we can't recommend enough. You get so close to the animals and it's really exciting when you pick them out from a mass of branches or long grass. For the large animals, you're behind a glass screen but for some of the tamer animals, you're inches away - like the incredible giant flying squirrels (yes, these really do exist).

I should say, if you're easily scared of animals, it may be best to stick to the tram, but despite some initial trepidation, I felt incredibly safe exploring the dimly lit paths once we had settled in.

You have to get back onto the tram to see the final stretch where the elephants and rhino are, and they're well worth seeing. We also went to the show, which could only be described as all-American in feel, with audience participation and cheesy jokes. I don't know whether it was the excitement of the place or tiredness setting in, but I actually really enjoyed the show despite all my prior cynicism. If nothing else, it nicely breaks the evening up and it's a great way to learn a bit more about the animals you've seen.

Especially given the price of a few drinks in a Singapore bar, I'd recommend a trip to the night zoo over a traditional night out any time."
,,Good fun for kids... if they are not crancky!!!,4.0,,"Had a great visit here... we took a tour here... while the tour and the guide were horrible (see my separate review on same), this attraction was good.

If you are not travelling with small children, recommend coming here by yourself and not in a tour. You can enjoy and see more.

With children, its a different matter. It is indeed better to go in a tour as you know the timings are fixed and if the children are tiered it'll be easier for you to handle them, not having to worry about the logistics of things. Also, most tours have special passes which let you beat the long que for the entry and the tram ride and get to the front.

The flip side is you cannot take pictures of any animals as flash photography is not allowed. You can have fun showing all the different animals to kids.

Have fun!!"
,,Like going to a zoo but in the dark,3.0,,"...so the animals were harder to see. It started badly because we were picked up from our hotel at 6pm and didn't arrive until 7:45. I felt I was one of the exhibits, being herded off and on coaches. Dreadful. Once there, there was a 'show' which was like a bad Panto with a few animals thrown in. A totally unintelligible compère who resorted to patronising audience participation. Then onto a 'tram' which pulled us through the dark and we did see some animals. Only when we alighted did things cheer up and we made freinds with some charming fruit bats. We didn't get back to our hotel til 11:00. Never again"
,,disappointed,1.0,,Didn't see anything different with it being night time. There were thousands of people there - it felt like the queues at Disneyland. Highlight was an animal (black and white utterly safe) walking along side our tram
,,Night Safari Singapore Zoo's Tram ride was a completely boring and dissatisfying experience to me personally.,1.0,,"I visited along with my spouse, son and daughter on may 5th night. We traveled from China Town where we were staying and the trip to the zoo took a good two hours. First by tram to Ang Ko and then from there bus to the zoo. it was too long and tiring. I guess i should have used the Taxi? the higher cost is still worth saving time and less tiring.

Then at the zoo, the fire-dance at the beginning of the show was very interesting and engaged quite a crowd. Hats off to the dancer/performers on a great job!

Then came the Tram Ride (Let me stress that this was the TRAM RIDE and not any of the walking tours which i do suspect might have been very much more engaging and interesting.) Some of the animals adding to the boredom were common buffalo, hyena, Indian Cattle and Wild Boar. the white tiger, lions, hippo and the elephants were very interesting specimens though.

Prices in the restaurants and other attractions are in my view very over priced and gave me the impression that they only want you to spend money (which is obviously one objective but need not be so overpriced).

We opted to stay on the tram and not get off at the restaurant stop or take a walking tour so i cannot comment on these options. it was all very artificial to me as we have seen many of these animals in their domestic setting (For example the buffalo and common cattle - where i come from)

The next time i visit, i would do a day-trip into the Zoo and walk around as well as try out the River Safari which i suspect would be much more interesting.

Overall though i respect the effort taken to keep the animals well fed and looking good as well as the amount of space they are allocated (not being kept within barred cells as some zoos do).

Its just that in my view, the night safari should be a little more exciting especially where kids are concerned (i actually did hear another visitor yawn very loudly - expressing his boredom during the ride). I do not appreciate the value-for-price paid for this trip.

Love the commentary though. Wishing the Singapore Zoo best of luck with improvements."
,,One of a kind in Asia,4.0,,"The animal show is funny, don't miss it. I'd suggest walk the trails to see lion and tiger feeding and take the guided ride later, esp. when the line is ridiculously long."
,,Night safari,5.0,,"Had a great visit here, lovely food at the restaurant and a tour on the tram seeing the animals up close at night."
,,Night queue,2.0,,"Bought tickets at our hotel ($140 for family of four)for the recommended Night Safari and caught a taxi from the CBD. Arrived in 25 mins and paid the very reasonable $24 fare. The prepaid tickets meant we missed the first queue and headed straight for the 'creatures of the night' performance at the amphitheatre. The show was interactive with the audience and showcased the animals in an engaging and nurturing way. Going to the show first may have been a mistake as we then joined the world's longest queue for the trams around the zoo. After 25 mins of standing in slowly advancing z-lines with jet-lagged children and no real end in sight we banged out and left the park for the taxi ride home to bed.
We may have been ambitious in taking young kids to a late event but didn't anticipate that so much standing around was entailed in the visit. Perhaps the safari can be completed when our children are older, better rested or both, but current feeling is that it was an expensive disappointment."
,,An unforgettable Adventure,5.0,,"Visit Singapore Night Safari last month, my wife and I was totally enjoyed the moment in the safari..We ride on the trum ( trail transport) travel along the safari trail where we saw tiger, lion, elephant, ox, and many more just meters away from us. The safari office are polite, greeting us and show us the direction when we needed. The animal shows are exciting and fun, lot of interaction between audience and those cute animals..Definitely will revisit again in the future."
,,"Enjoyable walk ""communing"" with the animals",4.0,,"Interesting time at the night safari. To fully experience the night safari, you have to walk the 3 trails. We first took the tram and go the full round trip around the safari. Then we went for the animal show. After which we took the tram again to the top point and walk the trail.
Advice :-Walk Trail 3 (the highest Trail) first, then the second and finally the first which will lead you back to the main gate.

The excitement of seeing the tiger in front of you and the sleeping leopard by the glass partition and you are standing 6 inches away. The baby spotted cheetah in the nest among others. You'll miss all that if you just ride the tram.

A word of advice, please do not use flash photography or torch lights as it not only startles the animals, it may also blind them. Though this reminder was repeated multiple times, there are still stubborn inconsiderate people who continue to do so."
,,Excellent for first timers if its second or third time then even after 8 years it's exactly the same,4.0,,If in Singapore it's a must and a very must if u have young kids. I have done this safari now thrice with each time the interest level going down since its exactly the same with no innovations in anything. Having said that kids would enjoy it and if it's your first time you would like it as well.
,,Good Night!,4.0,,"It was quite an experience to see some of the wild animals up close. The layout of the park is well done and the free range animal areas are exciting to pass through. In fact we had a tapir that almost brushed past us in one of the enclosures. The only drawback is that while the park is open till 12, you need to get there earlier than 9 to enjoy it. It wears a really deserted look after 10:30 and the food counters shut by around 10ish. The good news for Indian vegetarians is that you have a eatery that caters to them. We left the park at around 11:45 and took a taxi back; transportation to and fro is not an issue even at that time in the night. It's a great place for kids. Contrary to some reviews we did get to see almost all the 'star' animals in their glory. Hot tips: Get there early"
,,Would never go again,1.0,,"Lots of people rave about this, but personally I would never go again. Despite lots of signs about flashes damaging the animals eyes and upsetting them, this is not patrolled. Animals get camera flashes all the time, those with glass frontages to the enclosures get people banging on them and the image still in my mind is the elephant and lions pacing which is a sign of stress."
,,One of the best Zoo in my life,4.0,,"Two word from me: ""Amazing Zoo"", I love the way they manage this zoo, they never stop to make this place from being better to be best. If you want to bring your whole families and teaching your kids about many kind of animals, here the right place.

They have 2 kind of Zoo, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. They also provide some events. For Night safari, kindly reminder: Please DO NOT USE FLASH for photography! I've seen many people get pissed off when some people keep using their flash during night safari :P"
,,another adventure,5.0,,Have recommended this place to everyone going to Singapore . But also recommend getting tickets before hand as ques can take ages . Getting the train through is great . Especially seeing the animals up close .
,,Nocturnal adventure!,4.0,,"We arrived at the place last Sunday where we found a very long line of people queuing for the tickets. It was a good thing we have purchased ours online which made us skip the line. However, the line for the tram ride took us about 45minutes to get our turn. For all the waiting done, the ride was worth the leg pai from prolonged standing. We were taken into different trails where we were just a few feet away from the lions and hyenas which roamed about freely. There was practically nothing: no barrier nor fence that separated the wild animals from the tram full of people. It was an adventure that made our hearts go pumping wild especially when one of the animals would seemingly make eye contact as if it was ready for the kill. Make sure not to miss the late show where the trained animals performed on stage upon the prompting of the very funny emcee. Overall, this was one experience that will always come up in conversations with our family."
,,Worth a visit with kids,4.0,,"Worth a visit with children. Can see animals from very close. Do take a round on the tram and then necessarily walk around the trails, thats more fun, get more closer view. Keep a note of the feeding timing of big cats, then you can see ten from very close. Flying squirrels can be seen only if you walk around.The fire show was great. Good food options. Visited for the second time, felt fewer animals this time, maybe not."
,,nice tram ride if yiu dont want to walk,4.0,,we took the tram which is about 45 min and they show you everything around. its a good experience but I am more of a fan of the zoo.
,,Took 3 year old who loved it,5.0,,"The Night Safari is a real must-do if you are visiting Singapore with young children (suggest 3 and up, any younger might be a bit of a battle in the heat/humidity/late night). We booked tickets for the date before by accident, but the friendly staff at the service counter fixed everything up for us on the spot and made everything work. We watched the live show which was funny and relevant for kids, then part-walked/part-bussed the remainder of the zoo over about 2 hours. Really amazing grounds, terrific friendly and knowledgeable staff and lots of interesting and clearly very well cared-for animals. Alongside the zoo itself this is probably the best live zoo/animals experience I've had and my 3.5 year old son absolutely loved it."
,,Love this place so much!,5.0,,"This was the second time going to the Night Safari for me. My husband didn't want to go at all because he's not a huge fan of zoos in general but he loved it just as much as I did. The idea is brilliant, see the animals while they're active. The layout and design is very well done. If you can walk, I recommend walking the paths instead of taking the shuttles. You'll see a lot more and in your own time. Go early because you may end up staying til closing time!"
,,Must visit,5.0,,World class attraction. Best if you walk around the place. If short of time get the tram tix. Be prepared to spend at least 3 hrs here.
,,Absolutely worth the visit!,5.0,,"Beautiful Night Safari! There are different themed walking trails and also a commented tram ride through the park.
Be sure to start with the walking trails as the queue for the tram is too long at the opening! We started with the walking trails which took us about two hours. Afterwards we went to the tram station at the entrance - we didn't had to queue anymore ;)
The tram ride was very relaxing after the walking. You see animals which you don't see during the walking trails (e.g. tigers, elephants and some deers). The ride is commented live, so you get some further information about the animals.

There is also a live animal show which presents wild nocturnal animals.

I recommend to buy the tickets in advance to avoid the queue at the cash desk. You can also combine your trip with a visit to Singapore Zoo or to River Safari as these parks are situated alongside."
,,"Skip the line, tour with dinner",5.0,,"I booked my tour via Viator, Tours East. The arrangements were easy to follow and well executed. They send a bus to pick you up at your hotel and then take you to a central pick up location in chinatown to ""merge"" the different tours. it was very well done and all ran smoothly. We had a wonderful guide who personalized the evening for us giving us suggestions on what order to do things in, and walking me to the various places etc. very well done, and lovely to see the nocturnal animals. The zoo is about 40 mins drive out of the main CBD, so sit back and relax and enjoy the drive on your way there/back. They drop you back off at your hotel on the way back into the CBD. Good value and a fun evening."
,,A must visit if you are travelling with Kids,4.0,,"Creature show, the fire dance and of course eating at Bongo Burgers before you enter for Night Safari. The tram ride, with a commentary..about all animals..It was a great experience to view animals at night and a walk on designated path within the area."
,,it was not wow..,2.0,,"we have been there with my daughter and wife. we read and hear a lot good things about the attraction. our expectation was high. but it was not suprisingly good exprience . The animals was not visible in many of stage and the show was basic I have seen better bird show in Thailand.

I guess the place is famous because of marketing we'll

if you have a lot of time in Singapore.. You may visit but not highly recommended

best regards"
,,Fasinating,5.0,,There was long queue because of public holiday and I stay in queue for an hour with was relay well managed. But when I get to trail and safari I find it very impressive.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"I liked the concept of the night safari... animals not in enclosures and in their natural habitats. It was raining when I made my trip so the experience was a little ""dampened"" but otherwise a good experience."
,,visit day or night,4.0,,I'm not really a lover of zoo's but pleased we visited. We went in the evening which gives a completely different experience.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"A simply amazing place to visit in Singapore. The star attraction, without any doubt, is the tram ride. Very good eateries within the premises. A big thumbs up for the place."
,,Unique experience to visit Night Safari,4.0,,It was worth going to Night Safari as we can see the animals in the night by boarding the tram ride. It was wonderful experience to watch in animals in the night. Also fire show by professionals was good. We were tired after long walkable in the narrow lanes of the safari.
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"Night Safari is essentially a night zoo with a central loop on which trams travel, with a couple of stops where you may walk along several trails for a closer look at the animals.
I did not know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by the number of animals on display and the excellent layout of the park.
Some highlights were the hyenas which appeared almost too close for comfort, the ""Creatures of the Night"" show was entertainingly cute, the bat enclosure was rather scary and great, also seeing a giant flying squirrel jump and fly was amazing. There were many great moments which cumulated in a very good experience that I would recommend to everyone.
Travelling in April it was very hot and humid, so dress appropriately, and be aware there maybe mosquitoes (I didn't see any but my wife did)."
,,good expirience - worth the money spent,4.0,,"we were there at night safari after river safari, at 06:30 there was a fire show just at the entrance of night safari. It was really fascinating to see the three guys playing with fire and entertaining the crowd with their special skills. At abt 7:15 we were let inside the safari and it took 10 mins before we could board the tram.
The tram ride was about 45 to 50 mins. This was the wonderful experience. You go through different types of forests and see the animals of that forest area. There is a live commentary which is both clear to understand and educative in knowledge.
Sometimes you really get closer to animals and this is the best part of the journey. Otherwise too animals are just a few meters away they are'nt caged like in other zoos.
There are also restaurants and shopping shops where yu can eat drink and shop.
There are 5 walks which are ( 15-30 mins) walks through the jungles and caves.
I visited walk the one with kangroos, it was just 15 mins and the shortest i suppose, It was awesome the way they have created the caves and also it was nice to see the kangroos.
The tram goes through the dark forests,and its pin drop silence around yu get the feeling of being in real forest.
Must go for travellers who wanna explore the new feeling."
,,A good evening out,4.0,,This is a good evening experience especially for the children. One must plan transport to get to and from the zoo . Possibly a booked tour is the best way of seeing the zoo especially at night.
,,Yes the queues are bad- but it's worth it!,5.0,,"What an experience. Our group (5) aged between 4 and 57 went here and shared a wonderful evening. It's hard the believe the animals are so unperturbed by a tram load of chattering humans passing by. But they are and its magical. After the tram ride we did the wallaby walk, expecting to catch the transact at the half way station. Unfortunately because it was so busy the half way station was not working sober had to finish the walking trail which was quite a challenge with a 4 and 8 year old. Good offering at the end was a bit expensive and nothing much to write home about - but it was irrelevant. BRILLIANT evening. ( tip - when you join the taxi queue , just get the mobile out and call one to pick you up from the drop off point. Much less hassle than waiting!!)"
,,Really enjoyed it,5.0,,Highly recommended for those who are visiting Singapore...you can watch free ranging animals during the tram ride...can walk in the trails if keen..the shows in the safari are of very high standard....the queue for the tram and the tickets can be very long at times...
,,A RARE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE ANY WHERE IN THE WORLD,5.0,,The night safari is located well outside the city and near to the zoo. It starts at 7 pm. Book for a tram ride when u buy tickets as u cannot see everything by walking. There is a special interaction show on certain days and dont miss it. food outlets and souvenier shops are present near the entrance. dont miss the fire dance. Take a park map with u to know about the animals enclosures. It is a experience which will make u feeling like walking in a jungle at night and u will find animals in open and not in cages but there are moats hidden so that animals cant reach u. Its a gr8 experience and if you have kids they will love it
,,A total different experience...,4.0,,This is not so common in india. it starts in the evening by 7.00pm. u can do this place and zoo on the same day as its in the same complex. they take you in trams around a jungle kind of enclosure. u are in darkness and u cane see animals in their habitat. Must visit. i liked it. dont know abt others....
,,Night Safari with Mobility Issues,4.0,,"Having visited the Night Safari twice before, we travelled with friends experiencing the zoo first time. It was also our first time with mobility issues as my wife now uses a walking frame due to arthritis. We knew there would be long queues to board the trams but staff immediately ushered my wife and my friend’s wife to a seating/waiting area right at the boarding point. I joined the queue with my friend and we rejoined our wives later for boarding at the front of the tram where there were reserved seats with more access. Staff even had a special step/ramp and assisted us to board and alight keeping our walker in a secure area till we returned. It was all well thought out and worked a treat. The Night zoo experience was as great as we remembered from past visits, though we did not take to the walking trails after the tram ride. The Fire Show and some cool drinks finished off the night."
,,"Amazing, how come the middle east dont have something similar",5.0,,"been there in October 2014 with my in-laws and was touched, beautiful live show at the ""theatre"" and tour around the safari at night is just amazing and exciting, didn't like the fact that some other visitors dont obey the rule of not having the camera flash on as the tour guide kept advising, cause this was putting us in danger from the animals, but finally i was really happy to be there , it was my first time to see lots of animals in real-life, especially the hyenas :D"
,,Annoying system of long queues,3.0,,My family and I bought ticket online thinking it's the express lane and boy were we surprised when they was no system but the queues were so long that we had 2 little kids screaming. You would think Singapore is better organised!! We had to leave the safari cause the line was just not moving and there were so many kids getting so tired.
,,The only place that showed he'll to me,1.0,,I thought that it was a different safari experience but it's rather like any other zoo I visited in night. And I had done two mistakes first booking trip on valentines day and second going with my child. When I reached the safari I was surprised to see the crowd. We had to join a line for tram ride that took 2: 30 min to get in tram that too with child just imagine what would have been my situation. The staff were really rude. And they follow a queue system that's different in world. They have two sheds. If u get in tram in first shed it means ur lucky. But if ur sent into second shed from first think it's over for u. Once I got in tram I thought it would be different experience.but I was wrong the animals r in cage and we were in tram. It was like instead of seeing zoo in day I am seeing it in night and atleast in day we can see clearly in night the animals r barely visible.and I thought is this for what we struggled so much and I saw people arguing in queue it was like seeing another india their.it is not such a special experience what they boast in websites. I would better suggest u to spend ur time in jurong bird park which is calm peaceful beautiful and enjoying. I enjoyed every place in singapore but this night safari was a night mare and this is the only place I hate the most in singapore.
,,Great nightime venue,4.0,,"Singapore Zoo, as you would expect in such a beautiful city, is a really enjoyable experience. Balmy evenings are the perfect time for a visit."
,,Chaotic,1.0,,Way too crowded to experience wildlife with people oblivious to observing the nocturnal behavior of the animals. The zoo was a great experience during late afternoon but I'd skip this night chaotic tram/hike kid chaos!
,,Over hyped,3.0,,"I had too much expectation from this place but it didn't meet to my expections. There was just a tram safari which i didn't enjoy much..was quite monotonous, to the point that I started getting bored after sometime..No adventure at all."
,,Entertaining,3.0,,"It was a long, but entertaining night. There was such a crowd, I didn't think everyone would be accommodated on the ride around. There could be a little more crowd control and a little more efficiency scanning tickets. It seemed like double handling when my ticket was scanned twice by 2 different people in the one place!! The show itself was entertaining and it's clear the staff are passionate about their work and care for the animals."
,,Brilliant - a zoo at night!,5.0,,"Even though we weren't travelling with children, this was still a great place to visit. We loved seeing all the animals at night. The tram type service that takes you around is great and you can hop off at a couple of places to see other animals - the lions are a must!! Great fun and fascinating to see them all more active at night!"
,,safari in night,3.0,,you must have visited many safaris in day but this one is special as it is only in night and well planned.
,,unique & fun!,4.0,,"Had a great time at the Night Safari. Didn't bother with the tram & decided to walk along the trails. Bit more of an adventure plus no disturbance from anyone. No worries on the trails as they are well lit, marked & safe. Make sure you save some time for the Creatures of the Night Show which was entertaining. Visibility of the animals are a hit & miss as are all zoos. One can't really predict their behavior. My favorite being the Leopard Trail.

My only negative would be that there just isn't enough time. Wish it was open a bit later as I had to rush through some stuff to ensure I conquered the whole park. Definitely recommended for animal lovers."
,,Even the nights are better...,5.0,,"A lovely late evening, early night experience. The tram ride is a must! Very easy to reach and get back to the city with plenty of transport options."
,,River safari,4.0,,A well spent day with plenty to see and explore. Well described in the brochure. The eating places are clean and affordable. All in all a wonderful experience for young and old. A lot of walking so make sure you wear comfortable shoes.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,It took us an hour to arrive.The main activity is a tram ride.With the tram moving fast and it being dark we did not have a chance to see the animals properly.We did not see the Tigers .Felt not worth the effort to go all the way there.
,,Great for Visitors,5.0,,"A great place to take visitors, no matter how young or old! Get there a bit earlier and have something to eat & drink at the food court before embarking on the adventure. It always impresses."
,,Underexpectation,3.0,,"I did this in Jan 2014 so it might have changed. I was very sleepy as we had a long day and there was not much to encourage me keeping my eyes open. As it was my first night safari, I would say it was ok or average but as a zoo experience it was not much especially for the given price.

If you have the time and money and never done night safari then go ahead. Otherwise, invest the time and money in another attraction."
,,"Night Safari, a new perspective.",4.0,,"We took a tour to enjoy the Night Safari at Singapore Zoo. Traffic on the way shortened time available for the visit; but while there, it was most enjoyable. Seeing nocturnal animals gave us a different perspective. Show was fun! Worth doing."
,,See how Animals live!!!,4.0,,We travel via tram or walk across the night safari and see wild and endangered animals around us in their natural habitat. Various shows also happen there.
,,Animal lovers would love it,4.0,,It was a good experience...U could able to see animals directly...I could not able to see white tiger..
,,Zoo..at night.awsome experience,5.0,,"Suggestioin: Instead of taking a train, take a walk through the entire zoo at the night because you will be able to see animals more closely and enjoy the feel."
,,Kids would love it,4.0,,"We booked tickets online as there was discount offered compared to the prices over the counter. We started with Creatures of the Night Show. The host did a good job in keeping the entire audience engaged with his sense of humour. But was expecting more from the Creatures than the Human.
Tram ride has audio, playing information on animal that you would witness. It gives you the comfort and sense of safety. It is good if you do not prefer to walk. But we really enjoyed the walking trails as it actually gives you the thrill that you would expect in any safari, as you are on your own and cant predict what is next on offer. So that was fun.
Over good experience. Next time I would like to visit Singapore Zoo."
,,Night Safari Trail is a wonderful idea!,4.0,,"Night safari is definitely better than zoo and river safari. That said, it has two parts. 1) Trail 2) Tram.

Most visitors take tram ride first, but I suggest that a walk on the three trails may be done first, so you get a full experience of the park. The walk takes approximately an hour and half. It is very safe to walk, be careful of the surface, it can be moist, but otherwise very safe, lit and guarded. After the walk, you can enjoy the tram ride which takes about 15 minutes. Elephant, White Lion and a few other animals can only be experienced when you ride the tram, all other animals are viewable from the trail. Overall it is a good experience."
,,A worthwhile evening adventure,4.0,,"On payment of the trip to our transfer taxi company we were picked up at our hotel and transferred by coach to the night safari location out of the the city. We had the dinner option which was OK but more about meeting some interesting travellers from around the world. We were taken to the head of the queue as we were a party and the whole event appears to be managed by the Singapore Tourist Board who are extremely well organised. The road train then takes you around the zoo in the dark and you certainly see a huge number of exotic wild animals in their ""natural"" environment, not cages. A very well organised trip and then taken back to our hotel. Yes, worthwhile."
,,was ok ok,3.0,,"It was alright yet I had much higher desires.

While I discovered it fun strolling oblivious encompassed by the sounds and sights of creatures in the characteristic surroundings, I discovered the general experience to be alright however nothing I'd want to do once more. I prescribe that you begin off strolling and utilizing the cable car later on after the starting lines die down.

There's an ""Animals of the Night"" Show which is fairly mushy however I did discover the otters reusing jars play sort of adorable.

I had issues with the diverse strolls in light of the fact that the creatures were regularly covering up all through perspective or were uninteresting when in perspective.

Of every last one of animals, the hyenas were generally fascinating. They were the main aniamls that appear to be mindful of my vicinity and appeared to have a shrewd look about them as though they were anticipating how they could get away from the safari and eat every one of us individuals.

When you get on the cable car, its a touch valuable in getting focused on the measure of the Night Safari and where everything is. Was frustrated with the Outback Trail on the grounds that the suspension scaffold was deterred.

I did notice that towards the end of the safari (after 10:30pm) the creatures appeared to be more energized.

Tips: Walk about the recreation center to start with, take cable car later. Keep away from the show unless you're drained and simply need easy decision action. Be arranged for several stenchy minutes as the range around the flamingo stinks pretty seriously."
,,Wonderful experience :D,4.0,,"The night Safari was a brilliant experience and not like any zoo I've ever been to. We did make the mistake of going on a Saturday night because that's when a few bonus shows are on, but because of the crowds we never ended up seeing most of them anyway.

There was a 1hr+ wait for the complimentary tram from the sheer number of people (and we'd arrived at 7:15 for the Safari's open at 7:30, to be anywhere near the front of the queue you would have needed to be there closer to 5:30-6:00 I think (and get your tickets first, the huge snaking line is to get in the door for those who already have their tickets, which can seriously trip you up).
Anyway, because of the tram line we went on the walking trails instead, and I am so glad we did, we had those mostly to ourselves and got to take our time enjoying all the exhibits that the people in the tram would completely miss out on or be rushed through. I loved getting to watch the fishing cats go swimming and the otters tumbling around in a group in the water and over the logs. And since it was raining the Leopards were right up close to the glass wall on the viewing side of their enclosure, their paws are SO huge and fluffy! :D My favourite part was definitely the fruit bat enclosure though, which you actually got to walk in and through, some of the bats hung from the roof of the giant walk-through aviary, but a lot of them were flitting about above you or hanging from the tree branches right up close to the path and nibbling upside down on the hanging fruit. When we went through we passed one that was really into his quarter of pumpkin and just as we walked away we heard a sudden wailing screech and turned back to find him staring down and reaching for the river below him where the poor thing had accidentally dropped his piece of food, it was adorable :D

The food was ridiculously pricey for Singapore (around $18-30+ a meal) but not unexpected for a popular tourist spot like that and it was tasty enough, I think the thing that shocked me the most was the $68 price tag on a serving of Chilli Crab which was just never going to be worth that much.

Despite the fact that we ended up missing the Creatures of the Night Show and Lion and Tiger feedings which were the main reason we'd chosen to go on a Saturday, as we finished up our dinner (I think it was around 11:00pm-there was still a 1hr wait time on the massive queue still looking for tram rides) we heard a commotion start up off to the side of the food area and joined the crowd in curiosity around a fenced-off stage area. We were treated to a free and absolutely AWESOME!!! 5 minute fire-breathing/swallowing show by a 3 man troop of native performers (I'm sorry I can't remember the proper name the MC gave for their nationality). Something I hadn't known about at all for the night safari, but it was an awesome close to a lovely night :D"
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,"I'm generally not a huge fan of zoos, but was very impressed with the Singapore 'daytime' zoo, and had heard about the Night Safari so we signed up for it as a ship's excursion on our overnight stay in Singapore.

Our guide told us we could either do the tram ride through the park and see about 70 to 80% of the animals, or walk through the paths and see less, but be able to spend whatever amount of time we wanted at each spot. We opted for the tram ride, which was a mistake. Our time in the park was limited, and 45 minutes was spend standing in line to get to the tram. By the time we had finally gotten to the tram, done the around the park ride, and got back to point A, we didn't have time to walk but one of the trails, per our guide, and that would have also made it impossible to catch either of the shows. We decided to see one of the shows, but if we had it to do again, we would have bypassed the line for the tram, started out immediately on the trails, and then, had we wished to, we could have picked up the tram mid-way through the park for those areas not reached by trails. That said, my husband who is an avid photographer, was disappointed that he couldn't get any decent shots due, in part, to the lighting which is a bit brighter than full moon moonlight according to the brochure, and in part due to the movement of the tram and the fact that you are wedged in with three other people on each bench seat and only the two outside passengers have any chance to take photos anyway. The best spot is the outer right hand side of the seat and he was on the outer left.

That said, the exhibits are similar to the 'daytime' zoo, in that the animals are in natural surroundings, not cages, and the people are the ones whose movements are restricted. I think the visibility would have been better on foot, though and would recommend doing it that way rather than by tram."
,,Family Trip,3.0,,"Paid for the dinner and night safari before hand and don't feel it was value. The idea of dinner made me think it was more of a sit down, however, it was just an average buffet. The animals can be hard to see in some places and photography was difficult. I did enjoy the trip but wouldn't rush to go back."
,,Good experience..!,3.0,,"Night Safari at singapore was a good and unique experience. It's a well maintained place that has lot to offer. 'Creatures of the night'show,'tramride','fire-work show' were all good attractions. There were good and 'value for money' dinner option for both vegetarions and non-vegetarians. Overall it's an ''evening well spent'' kind of a place!! Shouldn't be missed.."
,,Place for Animal Lover & Kids...something different then Zoo,5.0,,"Night safari is totally different concept then Zoo, it has unique concept, A small train carrying all visitors for safari and we have animal in open air, real live animals with out any cage or anything...we have animal show as well....over all very good experience and kids will enjoy & even we adult enjoyed a lot as well....."
,,Something different,4.0,,"With a ten night stay in Singapore, we're up for lots of different experiences and enjoyed our tour to the night safari. We purchased our tickets as part of a 4/5 hour online tour including a buffet dinner for about USD139 for two and can recommend it. Valued the hotel pick up as it took about 30 minutes from the depo departure to get there. The Main safari Tram tour was good although you don't linger long enough at each exhibit to see the animals properly if that's your thing. After the tram, you can choose to walk around if you forgo the fire show and the animal performance (which wasn't a must see highlight unless you have little kids). We were happy enough to do the 40 minute tram and have an overview of lots of animals. It is dark and you have to be prepared not to see some. Fire show was a bit of fun and the buffet dinner very good value. All up a fun experience."
,,night raiders,4.0,,"all around good fun for the kidz... many animals to pet, rides and shows, and full of attractions... went on a weekday, so was not that crowded but still had to manage queues.. as usual food a bit on the steep side, but hey what can you do... indonesia also has a night safari, not as modern but feels more on the wild side..."
,,Night Safari disappointing,3.0,,"Having previously visited the zoo through the day we thought a night visit would be something different.
It was disappointing! The animals were difficult and in some cases, impossible to see.
It was a waste of time and money.
Seeing the zoo through the day is the way to go!"
,,Adventure at night,4.0,,"Easily one of the most unique experiences Singapore has to offer. The show was good in itself, but wait till you get out of the ampitheatre and ride the tour itself. I recommend seeing the show first, then ride the tour, after which you go exploring on your own. The tour is a hit and miss, ride on it with noisy, rowdy people and you fail getting your money's worth. Ride on the first car if you can so you'll hear the voiceover clearly, because the back tram is kinda muffled for some reason. Nice range of animals to see on it, and even better when you get off, as you can get up close, a Bengal tiger even lunged at me and boy if those mirrors werent there, who knows what would've happened! Hyenas, and other animals rarely being kept on zoos are also a big plus. Merchandise is okay, not so much of a big thing. I gave it a star short because the number of creatures in it could be improve to perfection, and the merch could b more distinguished, food choices outside should be much better. Overall, id recommend this for someone who wants to see worthwhile places in SG. Please, like everything else Singapore, do not go on weekends, or all you'll be spotting is a zoo full of loud chinese and malaysians."
,,One of the best wild life attraction of Singapore,4.0,,"In the myriad of wild life attractions at Singapore and Sentosa, sometimes a visitor is much confused on what all to cover and what all can be missed. The choice of selection depends highly on individual tastes, and here reviews come to a great help.
I faced the similar dilemma while planning for Singapore. And as a consequence, I ended up visiting almost all attractions of this segment. Hope that my reviews will help fellow travelers to plan accordingly.
Night Safari is located adjacent to Singapore Zoo and River Safari. As all the three attractions are at the same spot, you may plan to visit all, it would of course be tiring but manageable. I did all three in a single day, that too when I have my 9 years daughter with me.
As Night Safari opens up at 7.00 PM, the whole crowd of Zoo and River Safari converges at this attraction. So a large crowd and queue at the entrance is expected. The reason of this long queue at entrance is probably that everyone wants to finish it fast and leave to their hotels/residences.
There is a tribal fire show at the entrance at different timings. One show is just before the entrance gate is opened. You should ignore the queue at the entrance and first watch the show. As soon as the show starts, the queue will reduce as people will come to watch the show. So your hint is that as soon as the show ends, go towards the main entrance of the safari so that you are there before the queue is formed again. Show has some spectacular stunts therefore don't miss it.
After the show, move towards the entrance, you will find a long queue at the tram station. Everybody takes a tram for night safari, so queue is expected. As there is an animal show at 7.30 PM, so I would suggest that you move towards the amphitheater first. The show is about nocturnal animals and quite interesting as well. Your kid will love it.
After the show, move to tram station, you may have 15-20 minutes waiting time there. But don't worry, the safari has many trams to cater to visitors. The tram trip is about 40-45 minutes, you will spot a good number of animals on either side of the tram track. There is an audio while on tram. Don't miss a tapir roaming freely on road and it might pass by you ay a very close distance.
Many number of people skip the foot trails, as mostly all are tired by this time of the day. However, this is something you should not miss. If you have strength left, then I strongly suggest to go for foot trails.
Overall, the trip to Night Safari will take about 2 hours. There are restaurants and gift shops to keep you entertained after your trip.
As you will be damn tired after this, and then you might think to avoid public conveyance, then I suggest that you take a taxi. It would not cost more than 20-25$ to reach your destination from here, of course exceptions will be there.
Overall this is a different experience as you do not find many options for night safari in other countries though you will find many options for zoo and aquatic life at various other destinations. This is a cue to plan this attraction in your itinerary.
It might be the case that you will visit this attraction after zoo or river safari and you would be tired already. If you really want to enjoy it, then be there when you are fresh and ready to explore."
,,Something different,4.0,,"It feels like a jurassic park to me. Walking along the trails and hearing the growl of the lion.

Yes some of the animals were hiding but mostly we saw during the tour.

No fireshow during our visit but we were able to watched their creatures of the night. They also have good food but on the expensive side."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"If you want to do something different try the night safari where you get to see the animals that come out at night. Also included is a show with some of the animals, and a free bus pick up came with our ticket booked through the Tourist Information centre."
,,Night out,4.0,,This is a great place to visit at night sitting in a little train and seeing animals roaming free nothing is in a cage .there are dim lights all along the paths which gives a good atmosphere.we really enjoyed it and would go again....
,,It's Like Disneyland,3.0,,"We first visited this attraction in Singapore in 1998 and it was great. This time we bought our teenage children back, they had heard so much about it from us they really wanted to go. We paid around £90 for the 5 of us. Whilst essentially it is the same as it always was with the train tour round the park in the dark and the walking tours I personally feel Night
Safari has been almost ""Disneyfied"", I could have been anywhere in the world I certainly didn't feel I was in Asia. You now have a show at the start with flame throwers etc then it's a run to get good seats for the Creatures of the Night show, this was something and nothing in a purpose built amphitheatre. Personally I don't rate this place now, I'd rather give the little man down the Cherating River £25 and see some REAL wildlife. Singapore you need to stop Americanising attractions, we come from Europe to see ASIA."
,,VIP Tour was well worth the extra money!,5.0,,"First, the night safari is just an amazing experience. My kids were in heaven the whole time, asking questions and just in awe of the animals and atmosphere.
There were 7 of us, and we arranged for the VIP tour which has our own guide and buggy. Wow, that was cool - our guide was outstanding and she arranged for the whole tour to be what we wanted, at our own pace and answered all of my kids questions. It was more money, but well worth it!"
,,not all that....,2.0,,"We were really excited about this as it had been hailed as 'the highlight to your singapore trip' however we were a little disappointed. We dined at the buffet restaurant before which wasn't that great value and we found all the queuing to get in and out of the night safari a little tedious. I know its a night safari but it was so dark we could barely see anything and most of the animals were hiding or asleep. For an entire evening taken out by the night safari when you only have a few days in Singapore I think I'd have preferred to explore more of the island. never the less, I'd still recommend it as a visit. particularly if you don't have zoo's and safari parks locally to where you live (we have some good ones in the UK) hence I wasn't that impressed."
,,Unique,5.0,,"Visited the the Night Safari and it is a definitely worth a see. Doesn't open until around 7pm, so if you're going to do the other zoo's there make sure you start them later otherwise you will be hanging around at the front until the Night one opens as there is no where else to go"
,,Great evening attraction!,5.0,,"We paid about $25 in a cab to get there from our central Singapore Hotel. This was cheap because it was a 40 min drive. We had dinner first at Bongo Burgers and the food was excellent. They served alcohol and the wine was reasonably priced, compared to most places in Singapore where wine was very expensive. The Thumbuakar show was something to enjoy while eating our dinner. I had purchased tickets on line before arriving in Singapore and this was an easy handover of our printed vouchers. We had read a few reviews on this attraction and noticed there were many comments saying the queues were huge for the tram. Well there was no queue when we got there at opening and the park was very quiet (Monday night). The Creatures of the Night show was fairly lame but my teenage son was entertained by it. The tricks the animals did were pretty good though but I always cringe when they get somebody out of the audience and make them do stupid things! It was nice seeing different animals doing tricks and funny things so it's worth a look, just try not to get picked out to go down to the stage. The tram ride was very good. Good commentary. We saw heaps of animals from the tram, some of them were incredibly close. I noticed somebody else saying the animals were far away, well that's because their enclosures are quite big and they move around their enclosures so it's just luck if they are grazing beside the tram track. We thought the lighting was very good, you could see the animals clearly but we didn't feel the lights were shining too brightly for the animals. Being only nocturnal animals means all of them are awaken and walking around. So many times zoos have animals that are asleep through the day or you can't find them but all animals were seen here and that's what made the zoo really special. When we finished the tram ride we walked all the trails. Definitely wear comfortable shoes and take water with you as some of the trails are slightly up hill and Singapore evenings can still be very warm. We really enjoyed the trails, walking through the dimly lit trails and hearing lions roaring was a real experience. We were there for about 4 hours and this was plenty of time. We had no trouble getting a cab back to our Hotel as there were heaps of cabs lined up waiting for customers. It really is well worth the visit especially if you don't want to visit the other zoo in the heat of the day."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"I have visited this place twice till date & still like it very much

Always take a tram ride which takes you across 7 geographical zones of the worlds which you cannot cover while walking as it is not safe otherwise

They also have two shows in the evning from 9 PM: Thumbuakar show & creature of the night show.

Although the shows are complimentary but still Try to be in queue early for the show as they have only limited seats."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Personally i thought it was such a waste of time and it's hard to understand the hype.. getting there took ages and the tram ride didn't really give me a chance to enjoy the few animals i did see.. pus they were soooooo far away... may have made more sense to visit the zoo during day time. However there are some fab restaurants in there.
,,a must do for the nature lovers,5.0,,"animals can be seen in the daylight at any zoo and night safari is not all about the animals its about preserving our forest and creating as much as rain forest as we can, the freshness of air which i felt at the bus ride in night safari took me to the past where i could smell only fresh air and no pollution"
,,Great Night Out,4.0,,"Stayed to see the Night Safari after going to the River Safari. Definitely worth a see. Doesn't open until around 7pm, so if you're going to do the other zoo's there make sure you start them later otherwise you will be hanging around at the front until the Night one opens as there is no where else to go"
,,Night safari,1.0,,Animals appeared to be distressed and bored. Some of the animals are not even classed as nocturnal ........
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Get a tour and jump the queues. The cost is worth just about what a Taxi would be there and back. Wear joggers.
,,OK if you time the trip right!,4.0,,"We arrived just after 7 and the queue for the tram ride around the park was enormous, probably over an hour wait! So we ate and took a walk around the place. Its very well layed out and you see a lot of relaxed wildlife. We went back for the tram later around nine and the queue had died off! A good night out. Also if travelling by bus and mrt, allow yourself enough time to get back to your hotel before midnight!"
,,Do The Night Safari.,5.0,,"I recommend both walking and the tram but walk first as the queues for the tram are horrendous early doors. Walk round first as that offers you things the tram doesn't, then get the tram later when the queues are gone."
,,Night Wildlife,5.0,,"A unique experience saw first time a night zoo with nocturnal animals. You can take a tram ride, but we liked walking around and explore. A must visit in singapore."
,,2ND VISIT EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!!!,5.0,,"Firstly, watch out for some of the negative reviews, one of which I've just reported to Tripadvisor.

People complaining that they had to stand on the public bus that they rode to the zoo, & that's the zoos fault?
So it's my employers fault that I have to stand on the train each morning, that I catch to work??

And complaining that you have to stand in a queue for the bus train that drives you around the zoo?
If you don't want anyone else to be there, then hire out the zoo, so no one else can be there while you are?!

On this trip, we visited all three zoos.

This particular tour was the River Safari & Night Safari combo tour. After the River Safari Zoo section, we walked over to the Night Safari Zoo entrance and met up with our guide from the bus.

Then we ate at the same yum buffet restaurant as we did 6 years ago, before watching the fire dancers.

Although there was a decent size queue for the shuttle bus trains that take you around the zoo, as we were on a tour, we got taken down a special line to the other side of the wait area and bypassed most of the people in the main queue.

6 years ago, allot of the animals were asleep, which made the night safari tour a little boring, but this time EVERY animal was awake and doing something.

It was so amazing and felt really interactive, how the shuttle bus train we were on, had to stop a number of times to wait for animals to pass in front of us.

After the shuttle tour, we walked all of the walking tracks and again, all the animals were up and doing things.
I especially loved the bat enclosure, and also the massive Hyena that seemed really interested in eating all the smaller children that came along.

It's quite a unique experience to get to walk through a dimly lit rainforest at night, and felt really cozy.

A really neat experience, once again :)"
,,Short Visit but worth it.,5.0,,"We arrived a bit late... used public transport. It's easy to get there but it does take about an hour and a half from the centre. The MRT ride is quick but the bus seemed to take forever!! Make sure you manage to get the last connection back!
The zoo was nice, quite different at night. The animals behaved differently at night. The ride in the little 'train' was great and good commentary. Would have been nice to see a few more animals, but probably would have needed a bit more time. I would say make sure you get there early, as it takes more time to see the animals."
,,Done it before - would do it again!,5.0,,"We loved the night safari! Did it 5 years ago and although it's exactly the same, still really enjoyed it.
Give up on the trams when the gates open and do the walking trails. It's wonderful being so close to all the animals, the walk, noise and smells are all a close-encounter experience that you don't get on the trams. We did all the trails for a couple of hours, then caught the tram (the line had gone by that time).
It's good to get all the additional information by the guide on the tram - so definitely do both.
The message of no flash-photography is evidently difficult for some people to understand. Also annoying are the groups of people who crash around talking an laughing - you're not going to see much making all that noise. We avoided the crowds and had a great time."
,,Excellent Expieriance,5.0,,Night safari was a unique experience - we walked round the first part of the trail and then joined the train on the last section so got the best of both worlds - you get really close to the animals - never been anywhere quite like it
,,Not worth the wait,2.0,,"We travelled by bus here, standing all the way. We then queued for over an hour just to buy tickets before joining yet another long queue for the train around the night safari. We were disappointed with everything, but perhaps we were expecting too much,having been on night safaris in Kenya. We found this night safari to be very crowded and very noisy. We then queued for a bus back to the city and yes, we had to stand again."
,,Must see!!!,5.0,,"Best zoo in the world! All zoos should see this night programme and see the open plan of the zoo! This is the best zoo experience I have ever had!
Unfortunately it is very expensive at the park, food is very overpriced. $40 for buffet food. We went with RMC tours and it was a great experience and well worth it!"
,,The Night zoo is incredible,5.0,,"I loved the fact that this zoo doesn't have much along the lines of traditional cages that the animals are kept in (at least at night, when you can walk throughout their habitats and interact with them, with the obvious exception of the dangerous animals)"
,,Get ready to queue,3.0,,"If you go at night be prepared to queue....for us the queue to get on the night train safari was 1.5 hours, and we were told this was average on a weekend!...thats after you queue for about 20 minutes to just pay and get in......Once in and on train etc it is rather special."
,,great experience!,5.0,,"really enjoyed the experience.
allow 1.30hour to get there if using public transport as the bus journey is slow.
we only had time to do the train ride but saw plenty of the animals, wish we had time to do the wallaby trail but ran out of time as watched the two shows.
food and drink inside park is expensive
we had a great night out, worth doing."
,,A really cool thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,A really interesting thing to do is the Night Safari. You board a waggon car with others and are shown many animals at night when they are generally more active. We didn't walk the trails (it was really really hot and muggy) but that looked interesting too. Great for children too.
,,Boring,2.0,,Never hardly seen anything most animals out of sight. Very dissatisfied money scam not worth your dollars
,,One of a kind.,4.0,,"Dont go to this place on weekends, its too crowded. I loved the animals and the theme of the park. Dont miss the shows which happen late in the evening , animal show, fire show."
,,Walking trail is the best thing.,4.0,,The night walking trail it very good and we take a couple of hours to get around. I didn't see the point to the ride to see the animals when is dark and you can't see anything and the show was really average and design for kids in mind and not adults.
,,The One Important Piece of Advice You Need for Going to Night Safari,4.0,,"The night safari zoo is spectacular--an opportunity to see all kinds of unusual animals active at nights. There's no zoo like it, and for animal aficionados, it is spectacular. But you need to know one thing. Skip the tram ride--it's a waste of time. First, you wait in line to get on it, maybe 10 minutes, maybe 45. Then you have a 40-minute ride in which you drive by many animals. But you don't stop, so you barely get a glance at them before you move to the next animal. It's not a very useful experience. You do stop for lions and elephants, maybe, but that's all. It's really a 40 minute snooze. Plus, the guide is hard to understand and the high school class in front of you may be noisy. Just don't bother with it and walk the trails, which are superb. You may miss the elephants and rhinos, but you've seen them at other zoos. You'll get to see all the others, and the viewing is great. Much better to spend 10 minutes watching the tiger than 10 seconds. And you can stand around and listen to the male lion roar. So, don't bother with the tram."
,,Best zoo experience ever,5.0,,"This was not our first visit and won't be the last. It's not a cheap night out but an absolutely must see with kids. Some tips catch a bus not a taxi, do the walks first the crowds go tram and show first so for the first hour you have the trail to yourself, sit at the front of the tram and the front of the amphitheatre for best animal views. The cats are the best and the conservation message important! Totally awesome night out even the 9 year old made it to midnight!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,This is a must visit if you are in Singapore with children...the way the park is maintained is awesome and an out of the world experience...plz do not buy tickets from the counter at Night Safari as its expensive and you will get tickets from any tour operator inside the city at a discount of 6 to 7 dollars....carry bottle and you can refill water at many places at the park...with children it will.be good if one can bting packed food items...food at the Safari is damn expensive and you won't get indian food...full marks to the amazing adventure
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Night safari is quite unique. Tram ride through the park provides viewing nocturnal animals in gorgeous settings, in many cases close to natural."
,,Night safari,3.0,,"Great for the kids, but the daytime zoo is much better for seeing the animals. The 'fire eating' show at 20:00 hrs is the best attraction and makes the visit worthwhile. The restaurants are mediocre at best."
,,A life time experience,5.0,,"Of seeing nocturnal animals.

Very organised.
Reach on time otherwise there will be a long queue.
Also see the creatures of the night show.
No flash photography please. I dont know why some people cannot understand this fact even after repeated instructions.

Finding taxi after the night safari is aottle difficult"
,,"Horribly Disorganized, Chaotic, Amaturish",2.0,,"Once we boarded the tram at the zoo to view the Night Safari, it was very, very enjoyable. Amazing to see elephants and other animals up close and in moon light. However, up to that point it was a very bad experience. The park was extremely crowded, lines were very long, and the signs for which line lead where were nonexistent. Cutting in lines was rampant, as no one seemed to know where to go, and people were angry once they figured it out. Once in the park and in the line for the tram, you had to leave the park through a gauntlet of souvenir shops just to use the bathroom! The staff seemed overwhelmed and unsure of what to do with the crowds. If you're looking for an enjoyable and low-stress activity in Singapore, this isn't it."
,,One of the world's first Night Safari.,4.0,,"I did the night safari trip through RMG tours.
What a great idea to have a zoo that is open when most of the animals are awake and active. The tram ride is good and educational, but you get to see everything close up on the Trails when you walk through.So much fun and highly recommended.Kids would love it."
,,Great visit,5.0,,"This was our second visit, after coming in 2009. It seems to have expanded, there is definitely more to see, lots of walks to do as well as the ""tram"" ride. Food and drink was expensive but then that's Singapore. The only question we had was whether some of the animals were bored? The fishing cats and the one lone tiger seemed to be pacing. I hope they are all being well looked after and given larger spaces to roam in when the park is closed."
,,Fantastic up-close animal encounters,5.0,,"We did the night safari trip through Viator. Everything was really straightforward, with a simple pick-up and drop off from our hotel. Our guide, Nigel, was great fun and directed us through the night. Well worth doing via Viator as you get to bypass the lengthy queues, giving you more time in the actual zoo. The train ride is excellent, allowing you incredibly close experiences with the animals due to the clever technology employed. The animal shows were also very entertaining. Top tip is to make sure what know you want to do at the end of each section so that you don't waste any time getting from one part of the zoo to the next (it gets very busy)."
,,Great late night entertainment,5.0,,"We purchased a two hopper park pass (heaps of options available) at the venue. Cost was $67 per adult & 44 per child (under 12) Singapore $. The park opens at 7 but we caught the 4.45pm SAEx shuttle bus (we bought tickets onsite) from Jurong bird park (the other great park we chose to visit), we were able to purchase dinner at either the Safari park or the zoo while we waited for the park to open at 7pm (SAEx tickets were $6(Singapore) per adult, $3 per child for a 25-30min bus ride from Jurong bird park) . We went on a Sunday night and it was busy, we queued for around twenty minutes in the line which meant we were amongst the first couple of trams to do the tour (you see much closer on the trams than walking), the queues were still huge for the trams two hours after the park opens, so worth arriving a wee bit early!

The tram ride was reminiscent of Jurassic park movies with the tram driving through the tropical forest. It was worthwhile getting off at the one and only tram stop, to complete the first and only walk around stop of the tram tour. At this stop you walk through an open fruit bat enclosure and see more wildlife up close.

The tram tour lasted around 30-40 minutes and was very worthwhile. Very enjoyable and worth the effort. One of my top two Singapore attractions."
,,Left disappointed,2.0,,"Having had the night safari recommended I was really looking forward to it but unfortunately was left feeling deflated and disappointed after the visit. We queued for two hours to go on the tram and also missed the show on entry because we had to queue for about 3/4 hour to actually get in. During all this queuing there was a tremendous thunder and lightning storm with torrential rain (no fault of the zoo but be prepared). The commentary on the tram didn't match with where we were at times because it would describe animals on our left when they were on our right, this happened several times! It was very dark so if animals were not at the front of the enclosure all we could make out were outlines of them. Saw lots of deer and pigs! My husband has been to the zoo during the day and said it was much better than the night safari."
,,Underwhelming with massive Q,3.0,,"Went over Easter, booked online. Arrived an hour before the start, only to queue for over 50 minutes. We've seen animals in the wild and found this underwhelming. The zoo management need to think thru the queueing or start times - go see Disney for lessons.
During the tour of the zoo on the vehicle the guide was texting on her phone - missed a couple of animals. She was so bored - again go see Disney for some lessons on entertaining customers.

Tip: Don't eat there - very ordinary."
,,You don't see many of these about!,5.0,,"It wasn't my idea to go to the night safari but I'm very glad I was persuaded. It's lovely.
We didn't get there till 9pm but managed to see a bit of the fire-eating show and see the whole of the 'creatures of the night' show. What a great start to the evening. Although a little cheesy it was fab. Definitely needs to be part of your evening.
Then we got the tram. It takes you round with a couple of places where you can get off to see even more.
I'm so very glad we went. Great."
,,Limited wildlife,2.0,,Not much to see compared to any major zoo or safari anywhere in the world. Animals were few and far between. The only thing that creates a hype is it is a night event
,,You where this close to the wild animals,5.0,,"We did the Singapore zoo night safari & buffet dinner package from viator. This was awesome we all got put on a tram and was not allowed t use flash photography or lights as it might of scared the animals which was fine with us LOL. The tram just had railings on the side and as the tram was going through the park & the tour guide was telling us about the different wild life as we got to them, some of the wild animals just casually walked past the tram like with in a metre away, This experience was amazing the kids will love it & learn about the different animals in Asia."
,,Great Experiance,4.0,,"Had a really good time at the night safari, took the tram ride around the park, there's quiet a fair amount of animals, had a really good view of the lion and elephant. One down side was that at times it felt like the driver was rushing, apart from that the experience was really good. You can also walk around the park. If you get a chance you should definitely do it."
,,Annoying commentary on train ride. Show overly commercial but the walk was good,3.0,,"Been here a few times and some of the process is plain annoying. Like trying to sell soft toys after the show finishes. You have to pass the gift shop anyway. Is this really necessary when tickets cost >$50 and the place is always crowded. Then there is the tram ride. Must be a budget cut but they were sending the trams in twos but with one guide speaking so she had to repeat herself as we passed each animal enclosure. Very annoying.
But the walking trail is really good and you do get to see animals at night time. Overall, prefer the Day zoo which is excellent."
,,Night Safari Zoo,3.0,,"We went on the night safari zoo which of course was at night, we were not allowed to use our flash as it would scare the animals so we could not take photos. The train that takes you through has very little leg room and was not comfortable. The animals were on either side of the train and the area that they were in looked good. I was amazed to see Elephants, Lions and bears very close to the train with no bars around them. It took a long time to get onto the train with the amount of people in the cues. Was it worth the money, no. Our Zoos in Australia are better."
,,Actually see the animals awake!,5.0,,"What a great idea to have a zoo that is open when most of the animals are awake and active. The tram ride is wonderful and educational, but you get to see everything close up on the walk. The habitats are very natural (almost no cages). So much fun and highly recommended."
,,Night zoo is very commercial,3.0,,Sorry but disappointed in the night zoo option . It is very expensive and very commercial . Food upon arrival expensive and not what I call enjoyable . Beer price over the top in cost for a local beer . Some aspects ok however think Singapore has other better attractions than night time zoo . Next time will go to day time option .
,,not your typical zoo,4.0,,"not really a animal person but i highly recommend everyone to visit this place, I went here on a regular week day so there is no line for the shuttle once the initial crowds are gone, I walk around the trail first in the dark and it was the coolest zoo experience ever, it's mind blowing seeing animal right in front of you with no walls or cages in between you (ok maybe not for the tigers and leopards so you are not in any danger) the performance at the entrance was pretty good to."
,,Good tour to take,4.0,,"we were recommended to take this tour during our trip to Singapore and it didn't disappoint.

We pre-booked a guided package tour which turned out to be the best thing since it was a long weekend - Easter.

The night tour is a 45 minute tram ride around the park and the queue was horrendous from the time the gates opened until we left, Having a package tour by-passed the queuing and gave us direct access to the Tram journey - BONUS.

There are also walking tracks that you can use to view the animals- unfortunately it started raining during our tram trip ( it actually became very Jurassic Park like) and so shortened the visit. Remember to take an umbrella as evenings can be wet!"
,,great experience,4.0,,One of a kind experience. Great exposure for kids. Try to take the tram ride since some of the areas in the zoo are only accessible through the tram ride. The creatures of the night show is not to be missed.
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"I did enjoy the fire dance show. We did the Night Safari after a long day walking and visiting other places in Singapore, hence aiready felt tired to fully appreciate the zoo. Nevertheless, it Was worth it. The tram ride is a unique experience and educational for children and adult."
,,Night safari at the zoo,3.0,,"Evening felt a bit rushed. The fire eating show was good, the night animal show less so but the tram ride around the zoo was interesting as the animals could still be seen moving a interesting range of animals who appear to be quite used to seeing trams and people. Plenty of food outlets available. Took about 45 minutes to drive to the zoo from Central Singapore. Worth the trip though"
,,The one thing not to miss,5.0,,"Recommended by our son. We were not sure a visit to the zoo was necessary during a trip to Singapore,we could not have been more wrong,firstly it is a wonderful zoo with no cages,but going through the jungle at night on the tram,seeing the astonishing array of creatures in their natural habitat was really special.my favorite was the beautiful kettle clouded leopard that strolled through the forest about a metre away."
,,Enjoyable tram ride,4.0,,We did the Night Safari after a long day at the zoo so we were both too tired to get out and walk around. My advice would be to do them on separate days. You will have more energy get on and off the tram and to walk around and really experience the animals at night. My one deep concern is that one of the elephants we went by was displaying stereotyped behavior (rocking backward and forward on one leg). This is a sign of distress!!! It made me very upset and had me wondering what was going on for that poor creature - I was very upset that it wasn't being addressed. Elephants are intelligent animals and for such a major zoo to allow this to go on was really upsetting to me!
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"Despite the sheer amount of visitors in this safari, the wait was well worth it. The tram ride was uniquely fun, entertaining and fun. Had a great day."
,,Nothing great,3.0,,"Since I was accompanied by my elderly aunt & we had just landed on that day,we decided to take the night safari train & not walk any of the trails.Was sorely disappointed because the animals could hardly be seen due to the distance & poor lighting."
,,Nice Night Safari with the worst transportation,3.0,,"We enjoyed the zoo, it probably takes 2 hours touring inside. Clean and clear explanation. Recommend to take a tram tour then follow with the trial walk through the zoo.
HOWEVER, the public transportation design suck!!!! The official closing time for the zoo is 00:00, while the last bus depart at 11:45. We left at 11:00 (already allow enough time for public transport). We arrived the Ang Mo Kio station for MRT at 11:45, they said the last rail is 12:04. We managed to get on the train before 11:50. Just 3-4 station travelled, @ 00:00, the train stopped and announced train service stopped. This is not the terminal....!!! We paid full fare & they failed to get us to our destination. They stopped mid way ... All tourists were shocked ! There was no reminder nor clear instruction that the train would stop sharp at 12:00 no matter which station it would be. I think this is ridiculous! And of cos there was no refund. We had to take taxi way back hotel at last! This is the worst public system I ever experience."
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Visiting the Night safari by taking public transport is quite a task since it is in the outskirts of the city. We first went to Ang Mo Kio MRT. From the station take the underpass to get to the building right across the street. From there take bus no. 138. This goes straight to Night Safari. We got discounted tickets from Changi Recommends outlet at the airport. Time your visit well to make sure that you get out of the park before the last 138 bus leaves the premises. The safari itself was very good. It seemed like they take good care of all the animals. Only disappointment is they dont allow you to take pics. After the safari you can take the walking trails, there are short and long trails based on your comfort. The Creatures of the Night show at the end is must watch."
,,Did not live up to expectations,2.0,,We started the evening with the Creatures of the Night show. The presenter hyped up our expectations only to leave us disappointed having seen only a couple of trained otters and a racoon and not much else. After a 30 minute wait for the tram we did not expect the ride to pass by the animals so quickly that you barely had time to catch sight of them. I expected to see many more exotic animals but often they were not visible at all. Very underwhelming experience.
,,A great night out,5.0,,"What an amazing place to visit! This was our second visit to the night zoo and it did not disappoint. We did a walk around the zoo before catching the tram around the other parts that you cannot walk too, good to do tram at the end when the legs are getting tired. Plenty of places to eat but we did not try them. Creatures of the Night Show was fabulous and worth the wait to see.Maps and information were excellent."
,,Good time,4.0,,A great place to spend few hours with young kids. Try to avoid weekends as it gets very and queue to get on tram is long. Must do the trail walks as well (20 mins each)
,,A good place to visit,4.0,,"We had a good evening at night safari, the tram ride takes u around the park and we also walked a bit. The maps provided was good so that you dont miss anything. but after getting dark we were not able to see some animals."
,,"Well run attraction, some good big game, but also lots of deer.",3.0,,"For being so many people, I have to give Singapore and the zoo operators a lot of credit. They were so well organized at moving lots of people in a very efficient and low hassle way. We were a bit put off at just how many people there were, given a thursday non holliday night. They do a great job at conservation education. I guess the biggest disappointment was that about 40% of the animals we saw were some type of deer...which for that, we'd just go to Michigan or new jersey or one of the many densely populated deer states in the US. The hyenas were cool, and very active; the lions, hippo, and rhino were also pretty great to see. And the deer did get very close to the tram, so that was neat too. Just not the best thing we did in Singapore, the Aquarium was a bigger and better surprise."
,,Zoo with a difference,4.0,,"So what's different? You can view animals in a night time setting when they can/might be more active. Before the gates open (19:30) there is a short fire eating display which was entertaining, there are places to eat outside the gates. One tip, try to watch the 'Creatures of the Night' show first, starts shortly after gates open. This way you can avoid early queues for the land train which you can then do later with less queuing. Note, getting the train was a bit chaotic, as you leave the show you come to a boarding point but no one explains that is the point for groups to board. So go to the main station boarding point just a few mins away. Special tip, we combined a visit to the Jurong Bird Park in the afternoon and discovered a private bus service linking the two parks, 30 mins drive away. This avoided us having to take a bus, two MRT (subway) trains and a further bus and was well worth doing. The bus runs from the Bird Park to the Night Safari just once a day at 16:45, but check timings at the Bird Park ticketing booth if this appeals to you. You pay on arrival at the Night Safari end. Also note that the same bus company provides late and regular return services into the city which we also used and was good value and help speed return to our hotel."
,,Awesome time!,5.0,,Awesome to be able to see animals at night. Be sure to enter the bat cave from the entrance to make sure you know what you're getting into. I entered from the exit and had no idea what was in this building until a giant bat swooped down at my face.
,,Night Safari Singapore,5.0,,Night Safari is located just outside Singapore Zoo. The attraction starts by evening with a fire show. You can take a tram ride as it is a big area and the tram will stop near each locations. People are advised not to take photos with Flash as this effects animals.
,,Don't miss this experience,5.0,,"We had a lovely evening at the night safari and would recommend it to everyone. We arrived just before 7.00pm and queued for 30 mins to get the tram, which is a 40 minute trip with excellent commentary, around the park seeing the animals. Afterwards, we saw the animal show and then set off on foot, doing all the walks around the park. We loved it and saw lots of different animals. We couldn't believe it when we found out it was 11.15pm and time for us to leave to get our last bus back to our apartment. Thoroughly enjoyable evening and would suggest you don't miss this."
,,"ok, but a bit lame",3.0,,The tram around the exhibits were ok but the type and number of animals was very limited. A lot of varieties of deer. The big cats (apart from lions) are not on the tram trail. A bit disappointing actually.
,,"Delightful experience, like none other...if planned well!",5.0,,"The Night Safari (NS) at the Singapore Zoo is an amazing attraction, but must be planned well. We had purchased the combo ticket for NS and Jurong Bird Park online and could just walk in after showing a printout of the tickets, no waiting in line to buy tickets. We reached by 7 PM and headed straight for the Creatures of the Night Show which starts at 7.30PM. The show finished at 8 PM and we then headed for the tram ride. By this time, the initial rush was also less. We finished the tram circuit by 8.40 PM, during which we saw some amazing animals up close and personal. I have never seen such unrestricted enclosures! After the tram ride, we headed straight for the Thumbuakar (fire breathers) Performance which starts at 9 PM. Since this show is outside the entry turnstile, do remember to stamp your hand while exiting so that you can re-enter; the NS experience is NOT over yet! We got a table at Bongo Burgers right next to the stage and enjoyed the performance while having our dinner, which was also pretty good. Then we re-entered the zoo and sat in the tram, this time getting off at the mid-way station at East Lodge Trail. The crowds were at a minimum (it was mid week anyway) and we thoroughly enjoyed walking along the leopard trail- saw some amazing animals from a few feet distance! A little tired by now (there were kids too), we decided to board the tram and head back. A great place overall. Keep in mind the peak hour traffic while travelling in the evening, it takes about 45 minutes from downtown by taxi."
,,Pay the extra money on private tour,5.0,,It is well worth the extra money pay for the private tour and book early. You will not regret this at all. The place is amazing to visit.
,,Quite an Hyped place,3.0,,Fist thing that pissed me off was the long waiting queue for the ride. It was eco- friendly tram. There are much animals to see around most of them are deer's and rhinoceros. The guide was explaining. The show is quite interesting. There was also tribesman fire breathing show which was good
,,Night Safari,4.0,,Enjoy the well maintained place with animals kept in their natural habitat. Also enjoy the tram ride / shows and the food & wine at the place.
,,woooooooooow,5.0,,I never go to night safari it's too much good & beautifull with plenty of amazing animal I really can't belive how they control these animals.and we go by walk it's so much good & also by train that the person give good & enough information for animals
,,Night safari,4.0,,Reasonable trip but can be very busy. Wear lots of insect repellant. Food outlets expensive. Bit Disney like trip round on a team with commentary. Beer 13.50dollars. A glass!
,,Really good experience,5.0,,"The place is really good to visit as you can actually see a lot of animals, it is thrilling as you are own your own in the forest at night. the shows are also good."
,,You have the choice to see the animals at night ��,4.0,,"If you have seen Singapore Zoo, then you have the choice to see animals at night and that is what Night Safari is all about, there are different activities going on in different places at NS, then there is this tram which takes you around the Safari, the commentator has a very soft voice and narrates every thing on wa, only thing the animals apappear lifeless, otherwise worth once a visit."
,,Have you ever heard a lion roar?,4.0,,"We visited Night Safari on a Saturday. We arrived around 6:30 by taking direct coach service - SAEx, costing SGD 6 only per person. I was surprised not many people on the coach.

Before the safari opening, we watched the 1st show, Thumbuakar Performance, just outside the main entrance. After that, we spend some time in shops; then, we lined up for the 2nd show, Creatures of the Night Show. Sadly the show was stopped because of raining.

So we joined the long~~~~~~~ queue for trams. It took at least 50-60mins and finally our turn. We saw many creatures even thought it still rained. Our tram was stopped awhile by a group of deers because they lay down on the middle of road!

When getting off tram, staff showed us our photos taking during queue, it cost SGD 25 each, so expensive!! So we didn't buy any of them.

We walked every trails and saw more animals. While walking around we heard a very loud voice and didn't know what animal make this sound. Finally we realized it's lions!! Yes, it's the first time we heard lions roar!! I had been to many zoos, lion is always sleepy; but at there, lion roars. And, I suddenly understood why lion is king of the Jungle.

We bought a Night Safari mug, SGD 25, and took 11:30pm SAEx back to our hotel directly. I would say it's a pretty nice night trip.

(Don't forget to buy ticket first from Chinatown travel agencies, much much cheaper!)"
,,Just a hype.....,3.0,,"Many people recommended it but trust me I did not find it very attractive. At first the queue for the tram will keep you waiting for at least 20-30 mins. Then it is not very comfortable to enjoy the animals in low light, often the tram will pass the place before you notified the animal. you can take the trails and walk but you will find the animals are in cage. Even the creatures of the night show was not that much interesting. Now you decide...."
,,Overall a good experience!,4.0,,"Both the shows were good (fire and animal show) but a very long queue for tram ride so we opted to walk. did see some animals closely bu they were very slow and dull, not sure whether it was natural behavior of them or not.

Fire show was really good as we can see that very closely and even animal show was exciting because the host was interactive and dynamic nature of animals when they performing some tasks."
,,Preferred the walk to the tram ride.,4.0,,"We booked this trip after a recommendation, and found it quite interesting, however we were told to get on the tram and go around this way, and then maybe walk one of the trials afterwards. In hindsight we would have not bothered with the tramride and utilised the time we had having a leisurely walk around the park. All the trails link together and we managed to walk around in an hour, however it would have been much nicer if we had 2 -3 hours to do it properly."
,,one of a kind experience,5.0,,"A must visit for a family vacation. One gets a chance to see the nocturnal animals at a very close distance. The tram ride is very organised. Walking by the trails gives the visitors a chance to experience the night life of nocturnal creatures. Kids were really excited to see the lion and the leopard.Food is expensive and should be avoided. ""the creatures of the night"" show was fun."
,,Unique place - a must see.,5.0,,"Amazing experience here. Do not miss this while in Singapore. Opens at 7:30 and until 12:00. We finished the actual zoo quite early so we came back another day to do the Night Safari. Even if you time it better, the zoo closes at 6:00 and you still have a 90 minute wait in the heat, so that may not suit either.The taxi fare was only about SGD40 return from the city so no big deal really to come back.Start off with the tram ride around the park (about 40 minutes or so) and then go round the four interlinked walking trails of about 20 minutes each, so 80 minutes total. Easy walking and very exciting. We were the only people who could be bothered to do the little extra bit on the East Lodge trail to where the zebras and giraffes were, so try and do this as you may get some great photos without being interrupted by some shouting kids (and adults). Some people don't realise that you need to be QUIET!"
,,Not Impresed With Night Safari,2.0,,This was our second trip to the Night Safari & was very disappointed the second time around. The queue for the tram was 90 mins. Not food outlets inside the attraction. It didn't help that no one told us not to go during school holidays. Not impressed. Also while queuing for the trams if you had prams or strollers the walk way for the tams got narrower and narrower so that it was difficult to get through
,,Dismal!!!!,1.0,,"Perhaps with children but for us this was a complete waste of money. The animals look posed and trapped. The tram does not stop long enough to view them even if you wanted to. We were really disappointed. The food looked atrocious especially at the Zebra Cafe. If you compare this to Animal Kingdom, Florida, which is the same idea, it gets a large '0'."
,,Night Safari Tram Ride,4.0,,We enjoyed the tram ride through the zoo. I would suggest that you arrive early as the lineups were long. We had purchased our tickets ahead of time. We had dinner in the food market at the zoo. It is a bit pricey. I would suggest that you bring your own water bottle and a beer will cost you double here. The gift shop was cool and kids will enjoy browsing. The best part of the Safari was the after show in the auditorium.
,,night night safari,4.0,,As far as zoos go I do like the fact that the animals aren't completely caged in and free to roam to a degree. Started off with the animal show which was quite good. Then onto the motorised safari tour. Little bit hit and miss. They place food out under the flood lights for the animals which allows the opportunity to see and watch the animals in captivity. Some animals showed up on queue others not so. You have the opportunity to get off at stops along the way to walk and observe. Still all and all not too bad. We traveled on MRT and bus to the zoo and took the tour bus on for the return trip as they drop you off to your hotel!
,,Nice Visit,4.0,,It was a good experience for my kid. He enjoyed it very much. Very near to the animals during the tram ride.
,,A whole new experience,4.0,,We were told that this trip should be done if you have kids with you. But honestly we adults also loved the whole thing. Took some photos of the two shows but missed out on the actual safari as flash photography is not allowed. But we honor the decision as the animals deserve this much of privacy. Absolutely must visit on your trip to Singapore.
,,Not To Be Missed,5.0,,"Loved it. Get there for opening time, Queue immediately for the train ride around the Zoo to see all the animals, this is free. The queue gets longer as the night goes on. When train ride is finished then you can walk to different areas"
,,Must see this,5.0,,It was amazing. It has to be one of the best safari parks in the world. Must see! As I wasn't impressed with London zoo it was different level. Animals kept in more open spaces which looked more natural and more freedom for the animals. The night tour was great.
,,Good but not Great,3.0,,Was expecting a better experience. The animals were hardly out. The lighting was terrible. Yes it is a night tour but you could barely see anything. The tram ride is about 40 minutes. Overall I wouldn't go to this attraction again.
,,"Night Safari, Tiger feeding",5.0,,"We went specifically to go on the night safari. There are many areas in this zoo and it would be worth spending a lot more time here than what we were able to do that day. The animals are magnificent, have large and well maintained habitats and are obviously well cared for. The night safari offers a silent tram ride which we would highly recommend. The only frustrating thing was that photography was only permitted without a flash and it was too dark to take pictures even with a fast shutter speed. There are also walking paths that allowed you to see some of the animals and we were able to see the tiger being fed. The tiger was magnificent and it came right up to the viewing windows, what a thrill to see!"
,,not the best,3.0,,what a big let down o k if you want to see deer and more deer and around the corner more deer not many other animals to see lions tigers and buffalo food was expensive e.g. normal hot dog S$ 18.00 not impressed with this one
,,Very different experience!,5.0,,"This is one of the most unique zoo experiences available in the world, and quite a creative idea to visit the animals when many of them are most active - at night. We enjoyed our visit very much but it may be difficult for young children, since there is a lot of walking and the hours can be late. Food is available too. The biggest challenge of visiting is simply getting there and then getting home, since there doesn't seem to be much public transportation nearby."
,,Really interesting,5.0,,"This was well organized, We took the tour that included dinner. (which was OK but not great) We were picked up at our hotel and transported to another area where we met up with other travelers going on the same tour. From there we were taken to a restaurant at the zoo where we had dinner. We did the tram tour than the walking tour. Do not miss that. You get up close with all the animals at night when the are out and about. At the end of the tour we were driven back to our hotel. It was fun and interesting."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"With Singapore one of the safest cities in the world this is a night-time activity for young and old.

I joined an arranged tour so manage to jump the queues both at entry and the transport round the zoo. Not sure what price difference there would be but we paid about $60 per person which is probably not cheap but as said we were able to pass through very quickly. Even for someone who's been on an African Safari and someone who's decided to avoid zoos, this is not your usual zoo."
,,Dinner at the Night Zoo,5.0,,"We went to the zoo at night to see the animals. They have a small ""train"", which takes you through the backside of some exhibits. We had fantastic timing as the elephant came out to greet us and the tiger got up and walked around.

In addition, we also had dinner on this train. The food was quite tasty. The service was good. Finally, we saw the creatures at night show. This was also cool.

All ages would love this trip."
,,Synthetic and Cheesy,3.0,,"The night safari or night zoo was a big let down. We took the tram ride which lasts about 40mins. The animals were hard to see, if at.all and the tram commentator was so cheesy it was like Disneyland meets Pricilla Queen of the Desert! He even sang! The animals could well have been stuffed apart from the white lion which had a roar as we drove by. Too many deers and 'boring' animals. Whole environment felt very artificial and contrived. We also went to the animal show. A few trained Otters and a snake about sums it up. Whole place is really geared up for small kids who don't get chance to see wild animals. If you want a proper safari experience, go to South Africa, it's in a different league!"
,,Must see,4.0,,"The tram ride was amazing- very magical. Animal show was cute- the presenter was fantastic. Excellent fire breathing show, although I could smell the metho. Only issue is that food is ridiculously expensive. Eat before you go!"
,,Very Good Safari,5.0,,"I went there with a friend and we both didn't know what we signed up for, we thought that we needed to walk the entire forest trail but thank god they had a car. The trip started really well, our trip narrator was really informative and funny, she threw lots of jokes throughout the ride. The animals were quite diverse, mostly were animals from Asia/African region.
I didn't walk the trail, I was really afraid of snakes since it was drizzling. Tip for me fellow travelers, try to get on the first ride, around 7.30pm and enjoy some live show after and finish around 10pm. In terms of transport, I took MRT to Ang Mo Kio then changed to Bus no.138. On the way back, we took the bus from the bus station and paid $6 to get to Clark Quay.
In summary, a fun night with lots of new knowledge about the nature."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,We had entrance included to the Night Safari via our Singapore Stopover deal. Due to lack of time we went here on the night we arrived in Singapore and just did the guided tram tour around the park - this was enough for us and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The walks also looked inviting if you have the time. I would suggest eating before visiting as there are many options but they are very expensive. The Night Safari is a bit out of the city but taxis are really reasonable so don't let this put you off having a look.
,,Surprised by total absence of insects,3.0,,"A ride on a eco- friendly tram was good & soothing for legs after standing for couple of hrs. in the queue. They need to have more number of trams to cut short the waiting time. Some technical fault in tram running schedule further worsened the situation It was nice to see different type of animals in their natural habitat(?????). It was looking more like a big open Zoo. As we were booked on a group tour, no more time was available for walking trails, which were being appreciated & advised by other tourists.
Fire show at entrance was however good.
Our package included Indian meals which were just average.
One thing which surprised us that there were no insect in the so called rain forest & that disturbed us.If it is due to use of some very potent insecticides then it is not good from ecological point of view.
In the end I will say that it is not a must see attraction while at Singapore as there are much better places to explore"
,,Night Zoo a must,5.0,,"We did the night zoo and loved it

Almost 20 years on from our first visit it was still as amazing to see the range of animals again. We did this as a tour and worth doing it this way. The fire show was a highlight but the abiliity to walk among animals is just brilliant"
,,Very good,4.0,,The fire show at the entrance is good. The tram ride takes u around the park and it is guided which makes it very interesting. To see a lion roar in the moonlight is an experience in itself. The maps provided make sure you dont miss anything. Most of the cuisines are available at the restaurant. I wouls suggest not to do night safari and zoo visit the same day as it can be exhausting and monotonous.
,,A really good attraction,5.0,,"We went on a trip for the ""night time safari"" which is a fantastic experience the Zoo is very clean and the facilities are really good. All the animals seemed to be well kept and and in some cases you get hands on experience (I ended up with a snake round my neck)there are plenty of places to eat and loads of activities if you have children. All in all a really nice place to go"
,,Night tour is good,4.0,,"We did the night tour at the Singapore zoo, it was very good and we got to see quite a bit of wildlife but you can't help feeling that it is all very staged and the animals are constantly being disturbed by a stream of teams trundling past. Hopefully they get to rest and hide during the day. It was as if they were all on the strictest of instructions to stand by and look appropriately happy/wild/surprised to see us. Despite the signs and pleading of staff not to use flash photography or bang on cages and glass I was amazed to see how many visitors did. The commentary is interesting but unnecessarily loud. In a city of not a huge amount to do for tourists it is well worth the visit. We didn't have any but kids of all ages would love it. (If you can afford to fork out some serious cash for entry)"
,,The four walking jungle treks were the best part,4.0,,"First we took the 'tram' ride which we enjoyed and for many visitors that seemed to be enough. However, for us, the walks were the most enjoyable part. We purchased tickets from the Duck and Hippo hop on hop off buses, which for us was the most convenient and economical method.

We though the food offered for sale there was expensive and not really offering what we wanted."
,,Fire-breathing tribesmen and animals on the loose!,3.0,,"I initially wanted to watch the 6.45pm Thumbuakar Performance but changed my mind when I saw the queue at the tram station getting longer. I decided to join the queue for the tram instead of watching the show. There are two reasons for this decision: isn't it better to see the animals while there is still lights; and to watch a fire-breathing show after dark?

The queue is horrendously long but the moment the tram ride begins, it starts to move very fast. I guess that's because a tram can sit many people at one go and once a tram fills up, another one comes along to pick up the next group of visitors. I got into a tram full of Koreans. Annyeong!

Indeed, for the first few minutes, there are still some daylight left to see the animals but very soon, there was barely any visible lights left. I was able to film the beginning of the ride but I gave up after we were plunged into darkness.

I totally gave up taking any more videos and just sit back to enjoy the rest of my ride. Being a nocturnal zoo, the lighting is made to resemble that of the moonlight so there is just enough light to see the animals. As excessive lights might agitate or even blind them, flash photography is strictly prohibited. Hence, taking photos and videos would be a challenge due to the low light conditions.

Being on a Safari tram ride for the first time, the feeling is quite thrilling but I feel people with night blindness or astigmatism (me!) will find it a little difficult to see in the dark. Also, the tram moved off quite fast so we could not really observe the animals in details.

We returned to the tram station after 40 minutes and I was just in time for the 8pm Thumbuakar Performance. I even have time to visit the loo before the show starts.

After the exciting fire-breathing show, I quickened my pace to the Amphitheatre for the 8.30pm ""Creatures of the Night"" show. You have to hurry as the amphitheatre is very small. Once the seats filled up, you may have to wait for the next show (and they only have three shows per night).

In summary, my recommendation is as follows:

1) Skip the first show (6.45pm) of the Thumbuakar Performance (11 min) and go queue for the first tram ride.

2) The tram ride (40 min) will return to the station and you will be just in time for the second show (8pm) of the Thumbuakar Performance.

3) Head to the Amphitheatre for the 8.30pm ""Creatures of the Night Show"" show (20 min).

4) You now have the rest of the night (till midnight) to explore the walking trails!"
,,Most Impressed!,5.0,,Our family (teenage children) had a fantastic experience visiting the Night Safari. It exceeded my expectations and the planning and presentation of the zoo is amazing. Even though the zoo is busy you can walk the trails and feel like your alone in the rainforest with the animals. The train is virtually silent and allows you to get up close to the animals in their natural environment. Highly recommend to ALL visitors to Singapore.
,,Night Safari and Food,4.0,,Over here celebrating mothers 80th. Grabbed a burger and margherita from Bongos and watched the fire show. Burgers nice margherita expensive but cold. Night creatures show second stop bit corny but great for kids. The tram ride seeing animals at night was fun and you felt like you could reach out and touch some of the animals. Great way to spend a few hours. Caught the shuttle both ways and entry fee $50 total.
,,We enjoyed it!,4.0,,"My children, ages 20 and 16, and I went on the Night Safari two days ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our only regret was that we got there too late to enjoy the show - by the time we finished the self guided walking tour and ride the tram (with a campy, but very informative guide), the show was over. But all three of us felt it was well worth the trip."
,,Could Have Been More for the Money!,3.0,,"Cost $168.00 for four adults. It is a great concept and we did enjoy the animals we saw; however, there could have been more exotic animals for the cost.We caught the tram so maybe that made it more costly. I bought a really nice T-shirt and that cost me $35.00! We know Singapore is expensive and had been threre for a month and money was no problem ......until the Night Safari!!! Just a "" Heads-up""!....."
,,it felt like there were no cages...,4.0,,"They designed the park in a way what you will have a ""close encounter"" feeling with the animals, whether you ride the tram or do the walking trail. Of course, there are traps set between people and the animals but I just enjoyed the feeling of not seeing cages. This is just beside the Singapore zoo so you may go there right after your zoo trip (after 6pm). There are tour packages where one may avail of discounted prices if visiting 2 or more SIngapoe spots, just go to the Singapor tourist center in Orchard (opposite Someset MRT Station), or ask the counter where you'll buy you 1st attraction ticket."
,,"Don't live up to its promotion, disappointing",2.0,,"For the avid outdoor, animal lover, this place is a disappointment. Too much suited for touristy type and not worth the penny and the long journey from downtown Singapore. We had a good deal on the ticket from a ticket counter in Changi. I would recommend for those interested to buy the ticket there. Food was expensive. We took the carriage to get around but the guide talked too much and the stops were too short to observe the animals. However I think being in a city-state like Singapore, this is a fair enough destination for family trips with children, just don't expect too much in terms of observing animals."
,,Great night out,4.0,,"visited the night safari, mid week, and the crowds were large, despite this the crowds move well between attractions and activities, when we first arrived we went straight to the creatures of the night presentation, which was very good.
Then we moved straight to the tram ride that gets you up and close to lots of animals.
From there you can walk any of the walk trails at your lessure.

We then ate at one of the reasonably priced cafes for dinner.

Lots of transport options right out the front to get you back to your accommodation, either Bus, taxi or private charter mini bus for larger groups for about $50.
We caught one of the black premier taxis that cost $40 to get us back to Clarke Quay.

Great night out for the whole family...."
,,Highly Recommended,5.0,,"We were at the Entrance Plaza before opening time to see Fire Show and had Bongo Burgers and Margaritas which was great. Then went to 7.30pm Creatures of the Night Show which is really impressive - there are three showtimes most nights. The tram ride takes you through different ""countries"" and their wildlife with some animals close to the tram. We got off halfway round and walked along the Big Cat Trail. We finished the tram ride then strolled along the Fishing Cat Trail. These walking trails are great because you get to see some animals just wandering around in as close to their natural habitat as possible in a zoo. You can see the Fishing Cat trying to catch fish swimming in the stream. Don't worry if it has been raining as this is the time the animals come out because it is cooler. Disappointing that some people don't observe the ""no flashlight"" when taking photos.. Public transport tedious if you aren't on a tour. Take a taxi expecially at the end when you're pretty tired out. Open until midnight. You can purchase a combination ticket for the Zoo, Night Safari, Bird Park if you want. If you only have time for one ""zoo"" in Singapore make it the Night Safari as it is truly worthwhile"
,,Enjoyable trip,4.0,,"Made a trip there as a family with my 2 toddlers. Do note that on Fridays, weekends and public holidays, there will be additional shows such as feeding of the tiger which we missed as we visted in a Monday. The fire show at the entrance waa awesome. Show times are 6:45, 8 & 9 pm. Would not recommend the 6 :45 show as it is still quite bright and would not be able to fully enjoy the fire effects. Would recommend to start with the walking trail first then proceed with the tram ride as there would be a long queue after the fire show and also it would be good to have the tram ride after you are tired after the trail walk.
The tram ride was good and very informative. The guide on the tram is very knowledgeable and was able to view many animals from up close."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"The night safari is definitley a different way to see the animals but it is talked up a lot more then it should be. The tram is good but a lot of the animals are not visible. The guide was great however and a lot of fun. I wish the tram portion was longer. The show is vaguely interesting. The behavior of the other people there was disgusting and this really did effect our experience in a negative way as the staff just doesnt even bother to police it.

Overall I would reccomend people to go if you like animals as it is a unique experience just not as great as a lot of people make it out to be"
,,Night zoo,4.0,,Very well done and interesting but gets very busy. A 30 minute taxi ride from the town centre doesn't seem to put people off but was further than I expected and makes for alate night as you're advised not to go till after 9pm.
,,Improved Night Safari is a Winner,4.0,,"We took this safari about 7 years ago. It has been updated and improved and it was certainly very very busy when we were there so be prepared to wait in long lines for an hour or more.

We bought the package as a tour from the tour shop on the site of the Singapore Flyer. An air conditioned coach picked us up at the nominated time and drove us directly to the Night Zoo. Last time we visited this attraction we took the metro and the over land bus and the journey took an hour and twenty minutes each way - it was very tiring. So taking the air conditioned bus is a huge plus taking only 35 minutes. The return journey took an hour as the tour bus makes about 20 stops around Singapore dropping passengers at designated stops that are not too far from their hotel.

At the Night Safari we watched the ""Creatures of the Night Show"" with otters, a snake, mongooses, racoons and an hyena. Some of the animals perform tricks so its really good fun to watch. There is also some audience participation and volunteers are invited to join in the fun on stage with the trainers. Be brave - its fun.

This is followed by a tram ride that takes approximately 30 minutes around the grounds with a commentary in English describing some of the animals that roam around freely in their nominated surroundings. Each tram trip includes a number of carriages that altogether can hold 68 people put trip. All passengers are seated so it is a very safe and comfortable journey.

Food and drink are very expensive at this attraction so think smart, and take some supplies with you. To give you an example a Singapore 7/11 store sells coke for $1.50 Singapore dollars and the Safari outlets charge $4.50 ........ triple the price.

It can easily be 23:00 hrs before you leave this attraction to head back to your hotel so bear that in mind with little children. I saw quite a few parents pushing strollers with children asleep in them so the child's entry ticket had been purchased but they missed the fun and experience because they were so tired that late at night.

However, this is a unique experience and I would definitely recommend it."
,,Nice great place - another type of zoo,4.0,,"You will drive in a car durning the night/late evening through the zoo and see many wild and exotic animals. Sometimes, you alight the car and walk through the zoo. In some areas it is wet."
,,A unique experience,4.0,,Night Safari was really a unique experience in our life. The tram ride was excellent. But some of the visitors in our tram were continuously chatting that it reduced the thrill of the night safari. In spite of requesting them to keep quiet they never stopped cracking jokes and speaking. The Zoo should charge a heavy fine to the people who speak loudly and cut down others fun. Don’t bother taking your cameras as flash photography is not allowed…overall it was nice experience but somewhat artificial.
,,Enjoy a different perspective!,5.0,,"Don't even try to take pictures, just sit back and absorb a new way of looking at the animals you rarely see up close.

(Full disclosure -- we tried to take pics, even with our best camera using slow shutters and large aperture, and it was pretty futile, even after adjusting the RAW images for brightness -- see our Elephant example...)

We were wisely advised by the concierge at our hotel to take a tour group -- and the 5* rating is contingent upon that. The tour guide took the logistics out of the equation to make this the easiest thing we did during our long weekend in Singapore. No trying to figure out transportation there & back, no waiting in line, just straight through to the tram for our ride around the park, followed by a quick walk on the trails (which goes to places you don't see from the tram).

I thought I'd be freaked out by the bat house, but truly, it was the coolest thing ever! When else do you get the chance to see a fruit bat up close & personal? And as our tour group gathered to depart we caught part of the fire-dancers performance -- awesome!

The downsides -- lots of crowds -- if we hadn't gotten a tour group, we probably would have waited for 2 hours to get on the tram and that definitely would have decreased the enjoyability of our experience. Even on the trails, lots of people, a fair number of whom were completely not cognizant of other visitors and took up the whole path without letting faster walkers through. Or blocked the view or took flash photos which disturb the animals. So please, if you visit, be considerate of others.

Not inexpensive, but still, really cool."
,,Night Zoo Experience,3.0,,An interesting presentation on a tram after dark. The lines are very long and you must be patient. The shows are average. Unfortunately it goes by quickly and you can't study the animals at night but a good experience.
,,Interesting and informative,5.0,,"Very informative and interesting, It is another kind of experience to visit zoo at night. It is also not as hot at night. The show was entertaining as well."
,,Nice Place,3.0,,Nice if you are child traveller but for adults there are not much attractive things overthere but if you are child traveller you would love to see all animals and tram ride
,,Fun Night at the Night Safari,4.0,,"There were several animal species in the zoo that I only saw on tv. The tour in the safari at night was fun and exciting. Riding on a tramp made it even thrilling because it was an open vehicle - if an animal attacked us, it'll be easier for them to hurt us - nah but we had the Safari staff. The most exciting part was when we reach the area of the hyenas and stopped. Hyenas are known to have strong jaws and can crunch through bones. yikes. And we saw Rhinoceros!

We also enjoyed the fire dance, where two men plays with fire. The guests were truly entertained."
,,Never fails to disappoint,4.0,,"This was my third time to Night Safari, my husbands first. As per my previous visits, everything ran so smoothly and was a really enjoyable evening. Creatures of the night show was great and the tram ride very informative. Make sure you take the time to walk the trails too. We had dinner at Bongo Burgers and whilst it wasn't the best burger and chips we'd ever had- it was tasty and hot and not overly priced. Transport to and from night safari was cheap and easy as there was a stop right outside our hotel."
,,So much fun! Felt like African Safari,5.0,,No flash photography so don't bother taking camera if you are on tram. Walking tour available. Do both if you can. Crowded but they are very efficient in handling this so not bad. Keep kids quiet as this was problem on our trip with unruly kids shouting and into allowing us to hear speaker plus the animals don't like loud noises. Our tram was creaky but otherwise great experience!
,,"Good experience, but...",4.0,,"Went on a Night Safari, which was very interesting and good value, though two caveats:
1. You are not allowed to use flash photography, so unless your camera has a good ""night setting"", not much will come out.
2. Go on an organised trip - apart from the fact that the coach will collect/drop off at your hotel, you get preferred status at the entrance, bypassing the hordes waiting to get in. Had we been ""private"" I don't think we would have got in till it was almost time to close."
,,Nice one but looking artificial,4.0,,This is a nice and very well maintained park. You can see some of the endengered animals there. But overall it looks artificial for me - may be I'm very much nature lover. But it's worth visiting.
,,Night tour,3.0,,We were told that the night tour of the zoo was brilliant well we thought it was a waste of time and money and we would have seen more had we walked around in the daytime.
,,Be sure to come with energy,3.0,,"Since the Night Safari is at night (obviously), we went there at the end of a long day of sightseeing. That might have been a mistake since we were pretty footsore and tired. The animal show and tram ride were pretty good, but I think the experience would have been much better if we had also walked the four trails to see more animals and enjoy more of the nighttime atmosphere, but we didn't have the energy. Still, what we saw was nice.

The food in the food court was highly overpriced."
,,Amazing day out and Night Safari magic,5.0,,"Loved the zoo. Main zoo was in a different location to the Night Safari zoo. It was so well set out with different parts of the world being represented. Clean and lots of vegetation and the animal ""enclosures"" weren't enclosures but natural habitats set back from the main paths and separated by water and low walls. The animals were the stars and all looked comfortable and healthy in their natural surroundings. The orangutans were the stars of the zoo with the elephants coming a close second along with the tiger. It was amazing to see the orangutans so close and personal and swinging from branches and ropes almost right over our heads. Alot of the monkeys were swinging freely above us.
Loved the elephant show, very informative. Some of the more traditional enclosures were interesting, such as the reptiles and the cold-climate dogs and animals.
Abit disappointed in not seeing a pandolin. The food options at the zoo were disappointing, expensive and not very fresh.
Night Safari was a real positive experience where the animals were so active and the noises were amazing. We were lucky to actually see and hear the lions roaring- something I will never forget. The tram ride was so worth it and informative and sensitive to the animals in that it was mostly done in the dark and the tram was electric- so very quiet. Not invasive at all and the animals did not seem disturbed by the tourists at all. Some of the animals were free-roaming and so we got up really close, especially to the tapirs which were enchanting. The range of animals was amazing. Advise to do the walk as well which takes you to some other areas you don't see with the tram. All very well signed and no way of getting lost. Trail was dimly lit but ample to see the animals and there were staff set up along strategic positions to help you. Advise to do the walk first and then the tram ride as there was a very long queue and wait to get on the trams as everyone wanted to get on first. Plenty of time to do it so don't rush to do tram-ride first.
Watch the fire show before you enter the night safari as this was entertaining.
We did the zoo and night safari in one day. It was doable but it was a very long day as the safari finished around 11.30pm. Also, we thought there would be food available inside the safari park so didn't have dinner but there was only one expensive take-away place that sold hot dogs for $6!!!! Advise to eat before you enter the Safari park at one of the many places outside.
The Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari were located in one convenient area so you could go to all in one day but would not recommend it as you need time to do them all. We just managed to do the zoo and night safari in the one day.
There is public transport buses available to take you back to the city at $6 per person, so well worth it."
,,Animals and a great burger,5.0,,"Yes, it was an unexpected treat to find a huge mouthwatering burger and decent fries at Bongo Burgers near the entrance after several hours exploring this unique experience. Walk all the pathways first then take the tram to cap it off. The fruit bats flapping over your head (in their enclosure - and they are quite safe) and the roaring of the lions in the night air make it worth the trip out. Take the bus if you can and save yourself cab fare- but either way you go it is worth the trip."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"This was a very varied experience. Went for the safari + buffet and would not recommend this option.
The buffet was not good, the food was Luke warm to cold and whilst there was a range of choices for the mains they were all pretty average. The advertised buffet price is 42 Singapore dollars, with alcoholic drinks starting at 13 dollars.
Not all animals visible which was a disappointment as suggestion is you will see them all. Did not catch any of the shows as too caught up trying to see the animals.
Would not recommend, if you must go to a zoo then go during the day."
,,Great tours,4.0,,night safari is one option that should be attempted if you are to Singapore. very impressive to see the animals up close and life at night. I highly recommend this place to tourists. Also we cant take some photo because Flash use is prohibited.
,,Do the Night Safari,5.0,,"Not to be missed while in Singapore is the night safari at the national zoo. You board a little train which then winds through various ecosystems. The place is engineered so that you don't really see any fences or feel the presence of barriers, so you're sometimes face to face with animals. You can get off and wander around and then get on the next tram. There are a couple of restaurants to have dinner beforehand if you want to make an evening of it. Taxis are plentiful at a stand."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,The actual Night Safari was very good if not exactly long [approx 40 minutes] However we had forgotten that it was the Chinese New Year when we booked our trip. We made a point of going early to book our tickets and naively thought we might be high up in the line but there were so many pre booked tours the queues resembled Heathrow Passport control after a bomb scare. If we ever returned we would certainly try to join a tour group.
,,Fantasic Place,5.0,,The Night Safari is really great - had a good time - with seeing all the various animals and also with little surprise as you pass all along the safari passage. It is really excellent and enjoyable for young children as well as adults
,,A different experience,4.0,,"It is a different experience altogether to see the animals at night . The whole thing is well managed , Trams are good and really attractive .No photography as the Flash use is prohibited .
The Fee charged to the attraction is on the Higher side .
Buses To and from MRT and Taxis are easily available at the location"
,,Something different,4.0,,"Its something different because usually we visit the zoo during the daytime, but its the opposite here! Its good, and its unique. Might bore some of us, but its good to go once."
,,If you do the zoo give this a miss,3.0,,We did this after the zoo and river safari and were pretty disappointed. 90% of the animals are the same as the zoo and were all sleeping so it was pretty bad in comparison. The tour thing was alright but the line was huge and a massive wait probably not worth the $$s.
,,avoid on public holidays,1.0,,"we came at an odd time, new year. Long queues where ever we went for just a few minutes of ride. It wasn't worth at all.

To make things worse transportation back to the city was a kind of problem. Buses were either not available or crowded. So we wait to wait for a long time again."
,,Not a must visit!,2.0,,"Time required :3 hours or so.

If I have to rate the wildlife attractions in Singapore, my ranking would be as follows:
1. Zoo
2. River Safari
3. Night Safari
4. Bird park

I found the bird park to be very boring, night safari lacking much content, river Safari is good mainly because of the Panda, but the zoo is truly great. I must admit that the bird park shows are great. Shows at night safari also not bad. Our night safari shows were cancelled due to rain. The place is not a Good value for money without the shows.

Visitors can walk to the attractions or hop on and off the tram. I believe there are Separate charges for tram, but the same are usually included if you buy tickets through an agent.

The tram ride takes you through animal grouped together. Most animals are wild versions of domesticated animals like cows and other cattle. There are Hyena and lions too. The most novel attraction to me were the ant-eaters.

If you walk, you cover a wider variety of animals including some wild cats. There are 2-3 options of walking trails available.

Besides the above attractions, try to attend the shows. They are really good. Although, likely to be cancelled if it's a rainy day. Animal feeding sessions are also good and you can try to catch a few of you can. The show and feeding timings are published on night safari website. The fire show is at entrance, you can time your start of the visit with the fire show.

If you buy combined tickets for wildlife attraction it's cheaper. They are all located at the same place except the bird park which is at a different location."
,,expensive crowded but the kids liked it,2.0,,"after taking a cab to get there and buy the ticket, wait on a long-tail line to finally get on the train that takes you around the zoo in the dark. Although the very impressive atmosphere I was deceived by the short ride and small variety of animals. Only the lion I must admit was fascinating to see in its environment.
Despite my judgement, the kids loved it."
,,Care on the Night Safari!,4.0,,"If you are doing a Night Safari, make sure you go on an organised trip. This way you bypass the crowds waiting to get in, and get preferential service in the restaurant. Definitely worth a visit (day or night)"
,,Great Experience....except in monsoonal rain!!,4.0,,"My girlfriend and i visited the zoo when we visited Singapore in 2013 and it was a fantastic experience. We were however, lucky enough to go on a night when it was pouring with rain and found it hard to get around. Nonetheless, the animals were all quite active which was good as too many times we have gone to a zoo with no animals awake. The guided 'tram' tours were great and the guides explained the animals in great detail. Well worth the trip."
,,Great night zoo.,5.0,,The guided train tour at the night zoo is excellent. Very different to see animals behaviors at night. It is done to keep your attention. Nice.
,,Somewhat Disappointed,3.0,,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but the night safari wasn't all I'd hoped for. Let me say that I love animals and always make visiting the zoo a top priority in every city I visit that has a zoo. This one was okay but not a place I'd put on my highlights list.

Purchased tickets thru the hotel, which included transportation to/from and also the ""VIP"" line for the tram. The night we went it was not crowded so the VIP line didn't really save us any time, but it would be worth it had the zoo been more crowded.

The tram ride was okay but nothing special. You are sitting about 4 across so it's hard to see the animals when trying to look past the people next to you Also, given the darkness, if the animals aren't standing directly under the light, it takes a bit of time to locate them and by then the tram is moving. They tell you over and over that you can't take flash photos, yet people insist on doing so. So they keep warning you for about the first 10 minutes of the trip, which is annoying.

I think the best way to enjoy the zoo is to walk around. That way, you can spend as much time as you need/want watching the animals up close. You will get to see some animals you don't see at ""day"" zoos and they can be very active.

For those not used to the Singaporean heat and humidity, it can be oppressive. Be sure to take/buy plenty of water as you'll need it. The only air conditioned spot we found was the part of the store selling glow-in-the-dark items. We didn't see the shows but heard good things from those who did.

Went to the day zoo the next day (they are completely separate) and enjoyed it more, even though it was pouring down rain most of the time.

The night safari is one of those ""must dos"" in Singapore and I'm glad I did it. However, it wasn't anything special, as zoos go. Recommend it, but make sure you have realistic expectations."
,,LOVED this attraction!,5.0,,"Terrific idea -- at night, you get such a different perspective on the animals and their behavior! Plan to spend at least four hours, and bring your walking shoes; you can't see everything from the tram."
,,Walk Before Riding,4.0,,We entered the park right when it opened. We passed the hordes of people waiting to get on the shuttle and started walking down Fishing Cat Trail. We were able to see several animals before it was completely dark – the fishing cat was one of them. This allowed us to get some great pictures before it was too dark to shoot. (You can’t use a flash – even though the photos of the animals on their website are taken with a flash)
,,Hard to take nice pictures without allowing to use FLASH!,4.0,,"Again, it's night safari. I understand it's an attraction during the night time. I wish the stages set for each animal had better/brighter lighting. Some of them, it's just not sufficient enough to get a clear crisp image. Maybe my photo skills aren't up to par, but after reviewing my photo snaps of this visit, I had to delete 90% of the pictures because they were blurry and too dark. Besides the photo/lighting issue, it's an OK zoo. Not a big fan afterwards, it's a pass or go in my opinion. I'm sure I won't go there on my next visit in Singapore."
,,Different perspective on the zoo,4.0,,"Seeing the animals at night in a ""natural"" surrounds was really different. You ride a tram and some of the animals are an arms reach away. There is also the option to walk but I don't think the experience would be the same. The lines were incredible long, possibly because it was a Friday night but the show happens every night so I would try a week night. The fire show after was fun."
,,Good Night Safari!!!,4.0,,We liked the artificial 'natural' habitat created by the zoo. The walking trail and the bat trail were my favorites!
,,Fun zoo experience,4.0,,"I read reviews and thought the night safari would be a good experience. As recommended by the website, we planned out our course in advance and were able to see the whole thing in a reasonable amount of time (got there a little before opening and left a little after 10.) We watched the fire show outside which was a pretty cool experience. (It also goes on later in the night and you can go back outside to watch it). There are several restaurants just outside as well as snack places (ice cream etc.) that you can go to while watching the fire show. Once inside, we stood in line for the show inside which was highly recommended. The show was a little underwhelming after the rave reviews, but still fairly entertaining. We then took the different trails around to see various animals, as well as road the tram. It's pretty amazing how close we were able to get to various animals as we roamed the trails. It wasn't very crowded and it cooled down nicely. I would recommend bringing/wearing bug spray. The trolley drivers give good information on the rides. I definitely recommend buying tickets in advance online because it's a better value. There are also some good joint packages with the zoo and other parks if you would like to go to other places."
,,night time is great,5.0,,One of the best Zoo in Asia. evening is cooler and better to do the night safari. Bring plenty of water and a good camera to shoot under deem light.
,,This isn't your average Zoo trip,5.0,,We opted for the Night Safari as it is very different from our zoo experience back home. We walked through the exhibits and returned on the tram as the lineup was huge at the front entrance. You can see more walking around than you see from the tram ride. There are some interesting animals and they were definitely active. Our kids even got to feed some porcupines! The creatures of the night show was a bit disappointing but the kids enjoyed it.
,,Night safari,5.0,,"We booked this online before we left UK, we were collected from our hotel by coach and driven to the zoo.
We had the night safari and buffet. Surprise, surprise both the safari and buffet were very good and exceeded our expectations.
We wish we'd had more time to explore more of the trails."
,,Nightlife with Real Animals,5.0,,"We came to the Night Safari on a recommendation from a friend who lived in SIngapore for many years. If you have not done a night time zoo before, I think this is a great experience. The design of the zoo all but ensures you will see everything of interest. Admittedly, you will not see animals in their full natural day time colours, but they were quite active throughout the evening. The sound of lions roaring continues to echo in my ears. We were there on a Sunday night and the crowds were not that bad at all, especially after the first rush. The show in the amphitheatre is cute. You will want to take the tram around the park but it is also very worthwhile to walk through the easy to follow trails. If you are patient and quiet, you will also see much more. The ""fishing cat"", roaring lions, and the pangolin were highlights."
,,What can I really say?,5.0,,This place is just out of this world. It's litterally like walking into a wild jungle that you get to explore as you please. We had there dinner buffet for around $40 U.S. and it was ok I think they have better options. They also have two shows which I missed but I heard that they are great. The team takes about 45 minutes and it worth the amazing time you will have. They also have four paths that you can walk to explore on your own. It's a must do thing while in Singapore. ENJOY as I I'm sure anyone would.
,,An enjoyable evening,4.0,,"Our first visit to the Night Safari in 2001 had not been particularly memorable or enjoyable so this time I read as much background information and reviews as possible to ensure we would get the most out of the evening.

After reading some reviews we decided to visit the Night Safari on a week night when there would be fewer visitors. We made sure that we arrived as soon as it opened so we made the most of the time available. When we arrived we worked out which animals each of the four of us were particularly keen to see and prioritized these. We saw the show at the beginning (with the cute otters) then walked around the paths. Most visitors went on the train first which meant there were hardly any other people on the paths.. We decided to leave the train until the last when we were tired. Consequently, there were very few people on the train and our feet were grateful for the break.

It was an enjoyable evening. For those of you who are prone to getting bitten by mosquitoes, make sure you apply some insect repellent before you start."
,,Didn't meet expectations.,3.0,,"As far as zoos go this is a good one but the price lets it down. Being so expensive you're expectations go up and it doesn't meet them. We did the night safari which was ok but I wouldn't go back, the whole thing lasted 40 minutes and cost 90$! There are a couple of shows which are ok and it's cool you get to walk round the zoo at night but it's no better than other zoos such as San francisco and Chester zoo which are cheaper. If you have kids it will be fun but very expensive. To add to that there is severe lack of public transport (as far as we could find) and we had to take a very long MRT and then a taxi, not worth the effort."
,,Night Zoo is really cool!,5.0,,"We did the Night Zoo and loved it! This is a great zoo and the night zoo allows you to take a tram and see many of the animals that are up at night, literally riding by them, wihtout cages, etc. It was very cool."
,,Not impressed.,3.0,,"If you have been on a real safari don't bother with this. It was honestly a waste of my time. It came highly recommended to me so I thought its a must do. Booked through concierge at our hotel. Paid $60 including pick up by RMG tours. The place was absolutely packed. We got to get on a tram ride which lasted about 35 minutes.
After that you welcome to walk about in the zoo exploring but that did not interest us. So we sat in the cafe, had a bite to eat and waited for the fire eaters to come on at 9pm That was the highlight of my night safari trip."
,,Please remember - NO flash photography,3.0,,"Make sure to wear insect repellent; I felt like I was getting bitten the entire night. I also recommend spending at least a couple of hours since the tram tour takes 45-minutes and that didn't include the wait time. There were also 4 different self-guided walking paths that will take you to different parts of the zoo. Although it was a little disappointing since I was expecting a lot more animals. There were a lot of deers and lemurs. Lastly, it was difficult to take pictures with an iPhone since they do not allow flash photography (no disturbing the animals)."
,,Interesting but....,3.0,,"The lines, though they move quickly, are very long. You go around the zoo in a little tram which allows you to see many animals in a nocturnal setting. The ride itself is fairly short and while interesting we did not find it very exciting. Many of the animals are ones you can also see in a zoo moving around during the day. Because you cannot use flash photography it it hard to take any pictures. It is an interesting experience but I would recommend a trip down to the night life area around the river for a more interesting way to spend an evening."
,,great evening excellent attraction,4.0,,"We got there early for the pre-show - this is a little dated. we then did the train ride round the animals which is quite good. Then we set off on foot and had great fun with the children walking round all the dark little pathways with a different animal on every turn. walking the night zoo on foot is the best way to see the park and quite unique. Could be tiresome with small children or push chairs, but with teenagers it but up an appitite for a ""bongo burger"" and a fantastic ice cream from the icecream parlour in the pre park area."
,,Go to the zoo instead,3.0,,"The night safari concept is great but I was left underwhelmed by the experience. We had the buffet dinner which was passable, followed by the tram trip around the night zoo, which took about 40mins. You only catch a glimpse of the animals in the dark as the tram moves on quickly to the next area, not allowing enough time to observe them. The Creatures of the Night show was a bit of fun, but I think the whole experience is overrated. Visit the zoo where you can spend more time observing the animals."
,,Bad night,3.0,,We picked a bad night to go to the night safari. It was a public holiday and the crowds were ridiculous. We only got to go on the tram ride and watch the show which I would give a miss to be honest. We got no opportunity to walk any of the trail because the transport back was earlier than the closing time. So really we paid to do two things and it just wasn't worth it. There was a notification put up on their web site just after we arrived saying it was experiencing long queues and long wait times but we were already in. I wish now we had just visited the Singapore Zoo another day. It would be a great place to take kids in less busy periods.
,,Great experience,4.0,,Visiting this place was a good experience. However there is a long que to get on the safari. We had to was for bout an hour to get on the safari.. There are lots of entertainment around while waiting in the que.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"A very pleasant way to see nature up close from the comfort of a small tram. Difficult to get decent photographs as flash photography is not permitted so sit back, relax and enjoy the animals. There are several walking trails for those who are fit and able along with several shows that are included in the price. There is a large selection of places to eat either dining in or take away and this caters for all budgets and needs."
,,Second time around and still enjoyed it,4.0,,"This was our second visit to the Night Safari but as we were travelling with our family wanted to share it with them.

We enjoyed it nearly as much as the first time around. It was Chinese New Year so the crowds were a lot larger than last visit but we still had a great time. We watched the free fire twirlers exhibition at the start of the night before we entered and then started with one of the shows.

It was a briefer version of what we had seen previously but still enjoyable.

Next onto the tram ride around the park. This was no mean feat as we queued for over 45 minutes but it did supply a guided tour around the park. Following this we followed some of the many trails around the park to get up close with the animals.

Very worthwhile and a must visit when in Singapore.

TRANSPORT TIP: We got there by taking the MRT and then onto a bus that took us directly to the park but on return I booked a van as I had 5 people. They charged $50 but it was well worth it as they supplied a TV with MTV video hits with a Disco Light going on while we travelled back to our hotel. It was worth the money."
,,A Zoo in the night,3.0,,"It is a Zoo with many kinds of animals, open at nights. No special except the wonderful maintenance of the organisers. You can watch all the animals at different parts of the zoo. It is an atraction to children by going round the night Safari (Zoo )"
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Make sure you get there early (even though it opens at 7.30pm) as the queues to get train around the safari are really long. We waited in the queue for nearly 1 hour. My tip is to do the walking trails yourself first or go to the first night 'show', and then get on the train afterwards when the queues are a lot shorter. The show is on once an hour, and people start queuing for those quiet early too. We really enjoyed our visit and it is amazing how much you are able to see in the dim light. There are also animal feeding times as well. Taxi queues can also be quite long - we queued for about 30 minutes from about 9.30pm. A great attraction to visit."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"If you have the chance, experience the night safari . It's unique and worth the visit. The tram and the trails allow you to view many nocturnal animals. The tram offers a guided tour with commentary."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,The tram tour was great. The included buffet dinner was average. The ice cream was the best part of my dinner.
,,"Really, REALLY good",5.0,,"We all loved it, especially my kids. Great to see some animals I haven't seen before, some I've never heard of. Lovely natural setting, staff were great. Lines were busy, so if you can book a tour and get priority seating on the tram it's well worth it."
,,A different experience.,4.0,,"We went here on the Metro and train.A long journey, hadn't realised it would take over an hour to get there this way.Take a taxi or tour bus, we came back on a hop on off bus parked up outside, this took ages as well as we were the last drop.
However we loved the safari, we were put into little road trains.A little bit theme park, and the queues were long.Some folks were a bit noisy spoiling the experience a bit, we were supposed to be quiet not disturbing the animals.It was dimly lit representing moonlight.We saw some of the animals close up, and you could almost forget there were barriers between you and the dangerous ones.The queue had gone by the time we had been on our tour, so maybe go there later.We didn't have time to see the show or do the various walks.My tip, eat before you go, arrive early, see the show , do the walks, organise your transport the quickest way, not on the rush hour metro and bus."
,,A fun experience,5.0,,"Prior to visiting the night safari, I've heard plenty of reviews that says it might be difficult to spot the animal so I was quite worried that it might spoil the whole experience but I'm glad to report that I enjoyed my night there.

We arrived at about 7pm+ and spent roughly four hours there. The park opens at 7pm and closes at 12midnight so it will be a good idea to arrive early. Also, please eat before you arrive as the food here are really expensive.

The best way to explore the park and to avoid the crowd would be to only take the tram at about 9/10pm+ as there wasn't any queue when we took it then. Start with walking the various trails which are linked together and ultimately making your way back to the starting point to take the tram. After the tram ride, remember to watch the animal show at 10.30pm, the duration is quite short but definitely entertaining.

At some displays it might be difficult to spot the animal at first glance, but it was fun to take your time to spot the animal with your friends. We managed to see about 95% of the animals! The staff there are really knowledgeable about animal information, so feel free to ask them any questions about the animals you see there.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience there, so if you have some spare time definitely visit this unique night zoo!"
,,Take your time!,4.0,,"Been there with very little time, but enjoyed the selfexploring ways and the tram through the resort. Went to the firespitting site(not so impressive) and to the night animal show at 1030pm which was highly entertaining and surprising. The tour with the tram went a bit too fast, had unfortunately no time afterwards to walk around and explore ourselves. Take your time and make sure you can have a walk by yourselves before it closes. Additionally, get a bus afterwards instead if a taxi. Waiting queue Kate at night was enough for one and a half hours. Bus to go somewhere, then grab a taxi was much easier and faster."
,,Its a bit dark!,3.0,,"Once you find the entrance (a bit away from the Zoo) you enter a food court which is a bit americanised. The offerings are OK but not exactly Michelin star level. Be warned, if they are not the most expensive ice creams in the world then they are in the running!
You que to get in, You Que for the Tram so be patient and allow time. The tour was fun and many of the animals came close to the tram. It is of course dark or it wouldn't work so what you can see is somewhat limited. We enjoyed the evening but the Zoo was more fun in daylight and you can get close to some animals there."
,,Difficult to see animals in the dark,3.0,,"An interesting and novel experience. Unfortunately, too many people crowded there, especially at the tram starting station. And......I must admit that, during the tram safari, it is very difficult to find animals in the dark."
,,Different from the usual zoo experience,4.0,,"As with most things in Singapore, this is a very well run attraction. After being driven around the park with a commentary, it is then possible to walk around the various nocturnal animals. On several occasions we found ourselves completely alone in the dark watching their activities. Really atmospheric. We just wished that some of the other visitors could have kept the noise down.

Pre-book tickets to avoid long queues."
,,Worst attraction in Singapore !,1.0,,"Very expensive and very very bad , in our hotel they fix us a tour that costs 55$ for each . Not include dinner but include transport from and to hotel. I don't even want to tell you about the food and snakes prices!
The night safari is poor with animals and the main attraction is a safari like (they wish) cart tour for 40 minutes , the cart tour was in low light and not vary interesting .
As a man that's love animals and go visits zoo around the world I can tell you that we are very disappointed and the first thing we said we will do is write a review for others won't make the mistake and come here."
,,Great Place!!,4.0,,"If you wanna experience something new and exotic, this is the place to be! Well managed and lovely place. Went there during my anniversary outing to Singapore. If you are in Singapore, this is a Must watch place!"
,,Do the Night Safari!,5.0,,"One of the Best Zoos in the World!
The Night Safari takes you up close to the nocturnal activities of the animals up close and personal. As they say, 70% of animals are nocturnal and hence visiting them in the night allows you a personal experience that you will never forget.

There are various sections of the zoo well laid-out. You can of course go around in their road train but they also give you the option to move around on your own via different trails. We did both and each was a unique experience. The former is a guided tour with some nice information being shared regarding each animal's uniqueness. The trail is all on your own and allows for a closer view of the animals in their habitats...gives you a bit of an adventurous rush!

You can end your safari with some nice warm meals of various cuisine options. For Indians or vegetarians there is a nice restaurant giving you warm rotis and veggies to go with it, besides biriyani rice."
,,expensive,2.0,,"quite expensive fee for both local and non local, not really worth. just sit in the tram and let animal to watch you.. what do you think"
,,Night Safari a must,5.0,,we did the night safari and it was a delgiht. We took that little train that brings you right about and you have fantastic views of all the animals. There was also a fire eating show at the start and this set the tone for a wonderful night.
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,I would have given this five stars if not for the fact that we went during the Chinese New Year and so the place was absolutely packed. We had to queue for more than an hour and a half to get a tram. The tram also did not stop at the walks so we missed out on that. Having said that the experience itself is just amazing. We particularly enjoyed the Creatures of the night show.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"I was so excited about this as I was told about it by a few people I have spoken to about Singapore so my expectations were very high and I was not let down by it. We arrived to the park about 6pm and there was already a vast number of people waiting in line for the park to open at 7pm as we had an iventure card that included access to the park we went to the redemption counter the queue wasn't long but was taking a while a member of staff noticed this and stepped in and got our tickets sorted quickly there is a show they do before you enter the park with fire breathers which is good.

We joined one of the queues there were 3 in total and we had to wait for about 20minutes after the zoo opened to get on the tram for the tour around the park which I was quite impressed with I thought I would be waiting for at least an hour. Once you are on there and it's dark they tell you that there is no flash photography which I completely understand as it could hurt or distress the animals and they you are off you drive around the trail it take 45 minutes you see everything as its night all the animals are active. I really liked how a lot of the animals were able to walk around freely where they remind you not to touch the animals it's ok all the dangerous animals are in enclosures so it's safe.

I was slightly disappointed that when I came to the rhino enclosure that he no longer had his horn I know this is done to prevent poachers but in a zoo this animal is meant to be safe so this really is a sad thing to see that the zoo doesn't feel they can protect him from poachers other than that it was fantastic and definitely something everyone should experience."
,,Unusual...but enjoyable.,4.0,,"We visited this zoo at night. We had a light meal in the restaurant and then boarded the vehicle which took us around the compound. It was a very interesting experience, seeing the animal activities in the dark. Most enjoyable and something to experience."
,,An absolute delight,5.0,,"The Night Safari is an attraction for all ages. You view the animals, some of them rare in a close distance during the night time. We booked the night tour along with dinner. it was a rich and fulfilling experience. The tram ride was one of a kind - something that we hadn't experienced before, so were the trail walks. Our tour guide was very friendly and informative. We brought back some lovely memories. A must-see on your list if you visit the tourist-friendly country - Singapore. An absolute delight :)."
,,Nocturnal Experience,3.0,,"The Night Safari is an avenue to view nocturnal animals from a ""relatively close"" distance. The night show is a must see and it can get very crowded. Thus, its recommended that you arrive early for the show to ensure that you have a seat. It is recommended to wear comfortable walking shoes as the experience is so much more fun & adventurous via walking rather than taking the tram. Take care when moving around as it can be rather dark at some places. Food & drinks at such places of interest is expensive. Hence, bring along your own favorite drinks and snacks and enjoy the night!"
,,Favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,"An absolute must see. The three nature parks next to each other are all top level. My personal favorite is the night safari, it is set out so well and the range of animals is exceptional. The tram ride is really good and you really do forget the animals are in an enclosure. Best ""zoo"" I have ever been to"
,,Really cool!!,4.0,,"My partner and I visited the Night Safari in January. We booked through the Singapore city pass and would highly recommend this to any tourists visiting Singapore as its great value for money and they book all your tours and attractions!

We got a transfer from the city and arrived just after 7pm. When they let you through the gates, go and see the the animal show first rather than lining up for the tram, as that is what everybody does and you will get caught lining up for nearly an hour!

Once you get on the tram, you then are guided through the park to see all the animals, and it's really exciting because they are so close to you and they aren't restricted and fenced in like normal zoos, with the exception of the Tigers for obvious reasons.

You can take photos without flash, however because it's dark your photos don't really come out great, so just put your camera and phone down and just enjoy seeing all the different animals.

I was a sceptic as to whether this would be good and was pleasantly surprised!"
,,Loved it,5.0,,"We arrived and were told we could also visit the river safari, so we did that first as there seemed to be large crowds for the night safari. The river safari was very good and got us in the mood for what was to come. We got onto the tram for the night safari and got off at the first point and continued on foot. The crowds had died down and we took our time and really enjoyed the walk and the animals on show. The animals we all very active and the lions hadn't long been feed and were very vocal, this appeared to worry the nearby hyena and it was great to see their reaction. Well worth a visit and so pleased we went. Note of warning, if getting public transport the buses and MRT finish at midnight."
,,Dont waste your money.,1.0,,"The biggest waste of money ive ever spent, 20 min on a mobile train to see bugger all, then back to the start and that was it. Then to pay $11 for nuggets and chips which were crap,"
,,Expected better,3.0,,A lot more anticipation and lead up to this attraction but it does disappoint. We were in the second of two open buses but there was only one narrator who had to try to keep both buses informed - very difficult. Why there is a narrator to each bus if difficult to understand. The animals come out at night...maybe. Many had been given food to tempt them but maybe this worked for 50%. The animal show was good [~25 minutes] and the fire show [ ~20 minutes] was well executed but standard. Overall I would have expected more.
,,A very average attraction,2.0,,"Remember the ""night safari"", should be the night express. The team is very rushed and provides little time to take pictures.

The night show is alright, the fire show is very average.

Food at the venue is generally warm to cold, prices are higher as you expect.

If you go you are probably better doing the full walking tour.

They boast they get a lot of tourists, and they churn you through like a factory.

I would skip and just visit the zoo."
,,Night safari,3.0,,"I went to the night safari, really, it's not worth it ! Don't go!
the animals in there are not moving at all, just like all dead.
the only thing you can do in there is just take the train and look at the animals and it costs SGD$28..BESIDES, IT IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE CITY."
,,Average night safari,3.0,,"I've never been to the night safari but I think this place is full of fun. However, I think the animals seem a bit tired. I walked all the trails and hopped on the tram. The leopard totally slept through the night. I don't think you can see much unless you stare reals hard.
It's something that we could do after a long day and can't think of anywhere else to go.
Ps. I bought a ticket online so I got a 10% off."
,,Night Zoo experience,4.0,,Pick up and drop off at hotel. Guide and priority on tram which takes you around the park trails to see the animals in their natural surrounds lighted to give a moonlight effect. Extremely interesting and amazing - saw animals fro Elephants to small otters.
,,Nice Place but Not Excellent,4.0,,"The Creature show will begin in the evening around 7 of half an hour you existing music in you which they will show some Nice Animals, then you can go in night Safari which a Tram ride in an open Zoo most of the Animals in zoo are from India and then Fire. I have seen the Fire show because I was late last fire show is an 9pm. You may go on the first day of your visit in the evening."
,,Love the experience!,5.0,,"This was my third time going to the night safari. My boyfriend really loves animals therefore we are kind of frequent visitors of the zoo & night safari.

Previously, we bought park hopper tickets but on the third visit we decided to be a ""friend of night safari"" (membership). Because we were below 20 years old, we were able to apply for the membership at a concessionary rate. This saves us a ton of money in the future if we decide to visit again. So if you love animals, and would want to go to the night safari several times (within a year) I would recommend you to apply for the membership that suit your preference. Getting a membership too enables you to skip long queues at the entrance as members have a line of our own.

Because it is a NIGHT safari, it is hard to capture any photos as flash photography is strictly not allowed during tram rides and the creatures of the night show. If you do want to take good visible photos of the animals without flash, I would suggest that you to go to the park early when the sky isn't so dark.

What I love most about the night safari is the creatures of the night show. The walking trails are abit tiring for people like me who is not fit so proper shoes would do you justice."
,,A Safari by Tram,5.0,,"I know that this venue is high on any visit to Singapore and rightly so - the layout of the park and the way it is presented to the visitor is first class and there is a lot of other activities going on at the same time. The entry to the safari can be a bit of a bun fight so be sure to get there early. The icing on the cake was the ""Creatures of the Night"" show - not to be missed. However be prepared for crowds even if you are being entertained by the Fire Dancers and their spectacular skill with fire."
,,"Excellent zoo, but unfriendly staff",4.0,,"Visited Singapore Night Safari with kids, they enjoyed it, the sights are excellent.

But we encountered very unfriendly staff!! My family was queuing for Creatures of Night Show, but felt very thirsty, so I went to buy drinks for them, but when I came out of restaurant area, I was stopped by a zoo staff who acted very hostile towards me, commanding that I should get out of the queue area, and re-enter the queuing zone. I told her my family was already inside (couldn't she see I was holding many bottles of drinks!), but she continued to block my way, and shouted that she was in charge there, and that I must listen to her.

Where is customer service? I am not in some immigration queue, we paid $40 each to visit the zoo, this isn't a case of trying to cut queue - I was already inside the queue area -- why doesn't the zoo install drinks machine, or have vendors walk around to sell drinks (hot weather, la, in Singapore)? If the zoo wants such a rule, why not put up clear sign-board (or staff) to say that if you enter the restaurant area, you cannot come back in? Instead of enforcing a rule AFTER a tourist already gone inside? (This is like changing the rule in the middle of a game). But worst of all, why cannot the staff be more friendly, and kind, seeing that I was carrying drinks for my children, why she wanted to separate me from my family? Utterly bad faith, and lack of discretion on part of staff..."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,Went couple of times. Nice experience for the first timers. Need to plan for the shows. So plan accordingly.
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"We went on the night safari with my wives parents when they visited. It was a neat experience. You can walk the trails of ride on the tram. Lots of animals to see.

Food was also good. They have all types of food options (indian, western, thai, etc.). Our meal was about S$20 a person."
,,What a great experience,5.0,,"See a different side of the zoo by doing Singapore's Night Safari. You can either take the tram around, walk or do both. Great variety of animals and lion feeding was good. Loved the bat enclosure just for watching the face on my children as the bats flew passed their heads. Great educational talks about the animals and since it's night it's much cooler to walk around and enjoy! Kids loved this."
,,Terrific Zoo,5.0,,"Nighttime zoo is particularly interesting. Note: Flash photography is not permitted; therefore, if you want the lion or tiger, stick to a day zoo."
,,"Fun place, cool stuff to see!",5.0,,"We did the tram ride first (would recommend to help get acquainted with the general areas) and it was great - we had a nice English speaking guide that was informative yet fun. There's no flash-photography, so not too many photo ops, but it was nice to put away the camera and just take it all in and enjoy. Afterwards, there are 4 trails that you can walk, the wallaby one was very neat - you go in and there's nothing separating you and them, so you can see them hopping around and really get a feel (not literally) for what the animals are like. There are some areas, like the bat room, we opted to no go in and experience, but other things like flying squirrels and fishing cats were all very interesting. We went later at night to avoid tons of little kids, so if you're going as a couple I'd recommend that. We went at 10pm and wish we had a little more time on the trails, so I'd recommend arriving around 8-9 so it's still dark but that way you have plenty of time. Towards the end of the evening we got to see some of them feeding too, so that was a nice bonus if you feel like being a night owl. Be careful if you take the last bus, because it leaves pretty soon after closing, around quarter past midnight. Definitely a fun time and would recommend."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,Was a unique & interesting experience. The reptile show was very informative. I would go after dinner as the main rush is over.
,,Unique,5.0,,"Every time we visit Singapore this attraction is high on the must do list.
A great atmosphere, superb walking trails and a brilliant tram ride. It gives you an opportunity to see a wide selection of animals in a wonderful location, at night, but lit by occasional lights that give the appearance of moonlight.
A few tips; it can get very busy when the park opens at 7.30pm and most people seem to get into a long queue for the trams that tour the park on a 40 minute circuit. Our advice, go walk the trails for a couple of hours and once you leave the entrance area the crowds thin considerably. Then later in the evening having walked a complete circuit take the tram ride and you will find relatively few people around.
The tram ride is a must, a good commentary and you get to see areas and animals you wouldn't see from the walking trails.
There are several food outlets and restaurants, including one at the far side of the park, they have a decent choice but relatively expensive.
Take some bottled water as being in the rainforest it is still humid and can be hot.
We took a taxi from our hotel in the city centre taking about 25 minutes. Watch out for the taxi queue when leaving it can get busy and worth prebooking a taxi to avoid a long wait."
,,Novel experience,3.0,,"We had heard good stories about the night zoo, so visited with open minds. We booked our visit and transport through tour operator which was very efficient. I have to say I thought the whole thing was rather gimmicky, and would probably appeal more to younger families, whereas for those of us in middle age, it didn't really appeal."
,,An anti-climax,3.0,,"For a party of adults this was really an average trip. I think if you wanted to take children they would have enjoyed it as it would be quite exciting for them to travel through the animals in the dark. Unfortunately for us, a bit of a let down?"
,,"Animal prison, rubbish food",1.0,,"We did the night safari as recommended. It was awful - overcrowded with people chattering and shouting; animals doing stunts; animals in cages and small enclosures. It takes ages to get there and back unless you pay for a taxi, and the food on offer is probably the worst in Singapore. You can buy lots of overpriced tacky souvenirs. This is a very bad event. Do not go there."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Did the 'Night Safari' - overall disappointed as felt rushed for time - not many animals active, and didn't get to see many animals."
,,Wonderful night out.,5.0,,"If you only have time for one night time activity in Singapore, then make it the Night Safari. Quite a unique experience"
,,"Night Safari, Singapore",5.0,,"I would suggest taking a taxi to the Night Safari, and completely disregarding the orgnised tour. We paid for the tour and were picked up early from out hotel, only to be taken to Chinatown where we sat for ages waiting and waiting for others to join the group. We transferred to another bus and started the drive to the attraction. When we finally arrived, the park had been open for ages and we had a 3 hour wait in line for the trolly ride around. When we finally finished, at almost 10pm, we were starving and most of the resturants had finished serving food. We only had about half and hour to explore the wonderful paths and look at all the animals, before we had to board our bus back. The attraction was wonderful and I would have loved to have had more time to explore."
,,Singapore Night Zoo,5.0,,"An amazing experience for all ages. A chance to see nocturnal animals in their natural environment. A well organised narrated tour. Yes it is usually busy with tourists, but it still shouldn't be missed."
,,very over rated,2.0,,Dont waste your money.much better things to do in Singapore. The 14 dollar icecream topped it off. Watch out for the rip off taxis that want to charge $50 to town. It cost only $15 by getting taxi in front of zoo.
,,Not Worth the Wait,3.0,,"At the web site they said avoid the Q's by buying tickets on line. We were amazed at the length of the Q on arrival just to check in. There was in fact no Q at the ticket desk. After we finally checked in using the booking confirmation on my wife's mobile phone, we then had to wait over two hours in another Q for the tram to start the 'safari'. Only when we got to the loading point for the tram were we made aware that by paying extra there is an express Q. The food outlets were packed and we gave up on them. The views of the animals were not really that good and it was not worth the very long wait.
I would not go again and for those who plan on going I would advise going with a tour group as they did not have to wait as we did or pay the extra for the express Q"
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"In my opinion, this is a place worth visiting. Even though I have been to the Night Safari many times, I have always enjoyed this place. Go on your own and spend time walking the trails as well. You will not enjoy the place if you are in a hurry as some animals may be hiding at times. I think the entrance ticket is a little pricey. Bring a bottle of drink along as food and drinks in this place is expensive. Of course, use a pair of comfortable walking shoes & wear light clothings as the place can be himid."
,,Wild life at night,3.0,,The night Safari is the night version of the Singapore zoological gardens. Inside you can learn about how the animals live and do during the night time. It is advisable to bring some mosquito repellent to this place. Overall quite a nice experience.
,,Uniquely Singaporean!,4.0,,"If you have at least one night to spare, visit Night Safari instead of going shopping. There aren't many places with an attraction such as this. The amazing performances, fish spa, good food and exciting night tram ride will really make your evening! Don't leave Singapore without visiting Night Safari!"
,,My favorite night out is the Safari !!,5.0,,I am a regualr this the Night Safari... I love the environment and walking around in the dark to see what animals are out and about.. 5th visit already and intend to do it again... It is a unique experience and well worth the trip to the outskirts of Singapore...
,,A Long Wait,3.0,,"I visited during the peak Christmas/New Year period, and I would advise against it. We lined up for the very first session, and we stood in line for ages. The staff watching the lines were incompetent. We encountered many queue jumpers who blatantly pushed in front of us. A staff member witnessed this, attempted to send them to the back of the line, but this was ineffective and he failed to maintain order. Perhaps more staff are needed to keep things fair.

The tram ride was the highlight, aside from the wait time. That being said, sometimes you couldn't see the animals, because they were hiding or the lighting was too dim. I understand the need for minimum disruption to their habitat, but this is still something to keep in mind when you pay so much just to see the animal's silhouettes. The tram ride was a rare and enjoyable experience overall for the different animals you get to see, but once is enough.

The Night Safari is a rare experience and for that, I enjoyed it. However, I would avoid visiting during peak times."
,,A BIT OF A LET DOWN,3.0,,"I didn't really enjoy the Zoo at night, as its hard to see the Nocturnal animals. I wouldn't do it on a tour, its better on your own. You would have to take a taxi to get there. I much prefer the zoo during the day as you can see the animals much better and the zoo is very well spread out, and the animals are not in small cages.
I very much enjoy it at day time."
,,Animals are sleeping LOL,2.0,,"Not really worth seeing, most of the animals were asleep, my partner and I had fun though making a game of who could spot the animal first, sometimes we couldn't even see them. Wouldn't really take little kids as it is very dark and think they would get tired quick as there isn't much to see."
,,The Night Safari and Shows Outsanding,5.0,,A must do for all visitors to Singapore. The Night Safari on a land train around the Zoo to watch the Nocturnal Animals followed by a show with fire dancers and a show with animal participation. Do not just turn up book an organised tour to be fast tracked and avoid huge queues. We used RGB that were excellent
,,Waste of time,2.0,,"For starters the way you have to queue for this is ridiculous. Its an extremely long wait to get onto the transport to go around the zoo. The restaurants offer terrible food and is very expensive so bring your own food or pay the price.

The tour itself felt ""quick"" and some of the animals to be honest didn't even look real to me. Lots of deers and the same animals you see in the main Zoo.

Dont waste your time with this."
,,Disappointing Night Safari,3.0,,"Good concept, but extremely busy and overcrowded on the night or our visit. The included buffet dinner was no more than average."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Let me start off by saying that I was shocked to see animals here that are not even nocturnal.
I find it cruel to exploit animals in that way. Sure, it's a zoo, but keeping an elephant up at night so that people can see him in moonlight is just cruel.

The shows are not anything special. In the Creatures of the Night show I was amazed by the wolf but the rest of the show was dragging a bit. Also, do not sit on the far left of the amphitheater because you won't see a thing. Many people are still using flash when they are urged not to as they can blind the animals and it's really frustrating!
The fire show was lame and boring. A bunch of people dancing with fire sticks in their hands but nothing special - have seen much better.
Make sure you check if the feedings are happening that day because we were told they were not happening when we got there and were disappointed. I wish I had checked before.

Tram ride
The tram ride is great! It's really serene and it gets very quiet after 21:30. We actually did it twice and the second time we took the last train out and were the only ones on the tram. If it's really busy you are likely not going to hear the guide through the speakers but when there are only a few people on the tram you'll get an almost private tour.

Animals

Most of the animals are roaming free with no fences between you and them. In most cases that's ok but when you have a Rhino or 7 lions looking at you it makes you wonder how they are so docile. I did ask a guard and he said that the animals are trained but I am not so sure. There is a ditch about 2 meters between you and the lions. I don't think that training is enough to keep them at bay. I am afraid they are drugging them which is really sad. I hope I am wrong."
,,A great night!,4.0,,"We really enjoyed ourselves and had a great night. My advice is not to go with a tour company as you are heavily time restricted. Instead, catch a taxi and arrive early to purchase your ticket and have dinner at the park. The taxi ride to the park was only about S$23. By making your own way there and back you will have the whole night to explore the park at your own pace and not be rushed or have to miss something because your tour operator wants to leave. When the park opened, we started off with the ""Creatures of the Night Show"" then took the tram ride. Following that, we then took to the trails and saw every part of the park. It's great to see all the animals in their large open enclosures at night. You will have a fun night, guaranteed! Again, I stress the importance of maximising your time at the park and don't use a tour operator as they restrict your time at the park. The the guided tram line up can be up to 60 minutes wait time so you may want to wait to the later part of the night if the line up is too big at first. There's plenty to see and do here. Have a great night!"
,,Great place to with friends and family,5.0,,Like the animals. The safari especially the night one. Which has nocturnal ones. Value for money great day out.
,,Real concern for the welfare of the animals,1.0,,"In the U.K. Zoo animals usually have a large area to roam around in. At this place, you sit in a train that shuttles you around to the different areas. As you approach, the guide knows that the animals will be in each section because there is no where for them to hide. The animals are fenced into small enclosures that are ringed with wire fence (carefully disguised in the undergrowth). The saddest thing was seeing elephants and lions in tiny artificial clearings where they could be on display. The lions were pacing in stress.

The only good thing about this place was that the staff kept stressing the need to protect the animals in the wild. So education of kids seemed to be important, just ironic that the roaming space of the animals at this zoo was severely limited.

Made me sad."
,,Great idea. Come rested!,4.0,,"My wife and I loved this creative way to give people a better and fresh zoo experience. The lines were very long and crowded. We waited 30 minutes snaking through the tram loading line. The line moved fast as they had lots of trams for LOTS of people. We recommend going to the zoo first then the night safari, but you could easily do just the night safari if zoos aren't you're favorite. Also we RECOMMEND you come late in the afternoon after a restful morning. We fell asleep on the tram after a long day in the sun!"
,,"Night safari ok, would rather have gone during the day",4.0,,The night safari is a unique zoo feature. However you can not take pictures so your experience is not memorialized. I should have gone during the day. There would have been more to see. It was crowded and the concessions were limited.
,,Very cool,5.0,,I have no idea how they have done it but it felt like there was nothing between us and the animals. Unfortunately we did not see the zoo during the day so the illusion of being amongst the animals made it an experience we won't forget. Definitely worth doing.
,,A perfect night Tour but too crowded,4.0,,"We have been there at night time it was really a great experience
We have made our tour by the train , a great collection of animals at the same place almost moving freely beside you is really amazing.
We have enjoyed every thing there ,the only problem was it was very crowded"
,,"Hard, Hot and Humid",4.0,,"As I age, it becomes increasingly difficult to walk some of these venues. The walking on the night safari was difficult for me but the tram around the park and the show were great. The tram guide was informative and interesting. We really enjoyed the evening. We did not take the dinner tour but might consider that if we went again."
,,Too Crowded,3.0,,Did the night safari over the new year holiday and it was too crowded. Suggest to go back on a non-public holiday. The wait to ride was 2.5 hours so we walked the trails instead.
,,Night Safri is best,4.0,,"Night Safari: Exceptional night ride on tram, informative. Take a stroll, walk by trails to get closer look and great pics. Fire dance show quite impressive. Food for Indians was great at Ullu restaurant River Safari, should be good"
,,Different experience,4.0,,"We did birdpark, Zoo and night Safari on the same day. So at the start it didn't felt so special because we have seen most of the animals at the Zoo and queues can destroy the mood. At the opening there may be a lot of people in queue for the entrance and for the tram train and after same story for the show. The ride it self was nice but walking all the trails is a must if you want to see all of the animals. Some of them can be seen in a very close distance.

Tourist with poor english skills may destroy some of the fun, it was clearly stated NO flash allowed, still we had to yell at some to turn it off. DSLRs are not the best choice for night photos without flash so I would recommend to bring your phone."
,,Wasting of money and time,2.0,,"I thought it as a nice experience.But nothing. We were brought by the tram to show some animals who were under flash lights during night time. It was an useless activity as we can watch same animals during day time much leisurely. Then they didn't allow to take pictures with flasher. Prices of food little bit high. And other component of night safari is also boring.
If you want to watch animals, better go during day time."
,,Very different view at night!,5.0,,We started our tour with a buffet dinner at the Singapore Zoo. Food was average - nice but not exceptional. The highlight was definitely travelling around in the trams watching the animals at night. It was an amazing experience and one I would recommend.
,,Night safari,4.0,,Beautiful way to see animals during the evening. Remember to stop in the fire show (in etrance) also in your way back!
,,Crowded,2.0,,"We went to the Night Safari after reading about it in several travel books, and having recommendations from others. We were quite disappointed with this as a tourist attraction. It seems to have become too successful for its own good. There were hundreds of people, possibly thousands, there the night we visited. We entered a little after opening time, and there was a massive queue for the tram which does a 45 minute loop, so we decided to walk instead. We were then herded towards an amphitheatre with a couple of hundred other people, where a show was due to start - but not for around half an hour. So we left that, and again tried to find a walking trail, and when we did had a quiet twenty minutes or so looking at wallabies, an oddly disconnected collection of cave animals, some hyenas and a few less familiar animals. Then the crowds going in the other direction started to catch up and it became noisy again. As usual with enclosed animals, many of them looked bored and depressed (not the fishing cats however, who were busy stalking fish). Many of the animals were very difficult to spot, and because of the crowds, we quickly moved on. This attraction seems to have been organised so as to get the maximum possible number of people through. You couldn't walk half way and then hop on the tram. And the tram loop and the walking trail went past different animals. Overall, I think there are better things to do with an evening in Singapore."
,,"Fun night, definitely see the show.",5.0,,"We got there a little later and wished we had got there earlier. But we saw the show and went on the tram an it was fantastic.
Then we walked just some of the trails and saw some very interesting animals. But would recommend being there at 7:30, and going on a weeknight when it is less busy."
,,Again is a must,5.0,,"You need to buy the three zoo attraction at the same time to save money but you can spread you visit over a few days. I think it is four days. Unlike the visit in the day time to the zoo at night safari to travel around the zoo on land trains which are free. The zoo at night is completely different its magical.
It does not matter is you are sole couples family or disabled this is a place to visit."
,,Very boring,2.0,,Waited nearly an hour in line for a tram. Some animals were hiding. No photos were allowed because of the flash. Nothing exciting. Not worth it.
,,Exciting experience with the family,5.0,,The night safari is a must-visit for tourists. Be there early and walk the grounds. Do take the train ride and sign up for the daily safari performance. One thing that differentiates this place from the others is its 'openness'. You'll come face to face with the wild with minimal barricades / fences in a safe environment.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"A really nice well presented place to visit. It is a bit of a way out of the town, so worth the taxi fare as to get there by public transport is a bit of a faff and about 90 mins.
Staff really friendly my wife and I both felt it quite ""Disney esque"" but very well done
The animals were there all to see in natural habitat
Worth the entry fee"
,,Nocturnal experience,3.0,,"Did the Nocturnal Zoo through a tour company. Was too rushed, didn't do any of the trails, had to choose between Fire Show or Nocturnal show, dinner was overpriced at $35pp given only 45 minutes to eat then join the tram for a 40 minute tour. The animals we saw were amazing, but a good percentage are sleeping also, my advice, go on your own time and spend time there, we spent $180 and out in 2 and half hours."
,,Not to missed!,5.0,,"Never been to a safari and I don't know how is it during the day, but this one I liked it very much! Very good instructed! Be aware that is better to get the tickets before as there are a lot of people!"
,,Enjoyable!,3.0,,"Really nice place to visit, can I strongly recommend not to sit at the back of the train as when you do the tour the driver seems to forget that you can't see what the middle of the train sees and drives off! If we had more time we would of walked round and had a really good view! Quite expensive all in all!"
,,"enjoyed, really interesting",5.0,,"The night safari was great, try it. You can see lots of interesting and beautiful animals there. Try also walking around the night safari, well worth it :)"
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Went to the Night Safari on last night in Singapore before our flight. We were on time restrictions and getting lost was not very convenient. It would have been nice to have more time. It was very difficult to see all of the animals and when we went on the tram ride being at the back of the tram by the time we go anywhere near where the animals were the driver had sped up again so we missed out on seeing them and getting photos.
,,Nothing Adventure,2.0,,Not a worth to visit this place wastage of Time & Money its better to avoid nothing adventurous very few animal & the show was very avg too
,,a bit disappointed,3.0,,"We went to the night safari with a group booking of around 30 people. The bonus part of the trip was thet we were picked up right on the doorstep of the hotel and transferred to a direct bus to the zoo. By visiting the zoo in a large group is very rushed. We found that we had to leave one of the show attractions early, missing the end of the show so we could get the train through the main part of the safari. When we were on the guided tram tour, we found that the tram was going too fast to actually have a good view of the animals - but it was good to see them in their natural habitats - but dont blink, you will miss it! Like any tourist park or attraction, once you are in there it costs the earth to do or buy anything in there - very expensive! If you are going to go to the zoo, go by yourselves, go early, take your time to see animals at your own pace, and expect to pay more than your budget."
,,Up close!,4.0,,Was a lovely experience to see the animals at night time and some were very close to the tram. Overall a good experience.
,,Excellent we love the experience,5.0,,"been here over 10 years ago, my wife had never been
Lots to see, a must is the arena show, very good and asian grey wolf howl was amazing.
Took tram tour, don't rush to join first trip the wait may put you off, do a walking trail then join tram, walking trails allow you to come up close to some of the animals, don't touch it not a petting zoo.
For eating don't be trapped by burger place at entrance, wait until you enter main park they have a mix of fine dinning to buffet meals, Asian and western.
It's a must do when in Singapore, we did this outside of an organised trip, taxi from city centre 24 dollars each way 45 minutes, entrance 42 dollars (but saw offers online if booked in advance)."
,,close encounters!,4.0,,"Best to club this activity with Zoo experience. Ideally do the zoo in the second half of the day, followed by Night safari in the night. You can catch up for some really yummy dinner options in the premise itself!

Advised to not to make noise while you're moving out in the jungle at night. The night safari experience was spooky yet very thrilling!

The shows are something to not to miss!
The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing!"
,,Great Experience to see animals in night,5.0,,"Night safari is grea to visit. You will see the same animals you see in Singapore zoo in day time, but the experiance is different. Important things is to be there on time, See the animals and also make sure that you attend the night animal shows. The tram ride saves lots of time and is well managed."
,,Average place,3.0,,The most unique thing about the night safari is that you get to see nocturnal animals in action. However the animals are usually not active most of the time so may not be worth a visit.
,,Amazing Must Do!,5.0,,We did the classic safari tour and were very lucky that it was only us in the group so our guide Walter tailored it to us. It was fantastic. We were so happy. we got see to the wolves howling and all the animals were out and about. couldnt recommend this experience enough.
,,Not worth $42 ticket price,2.0,,"We had high expectations from lonely planet and some friends but we were very disappointed.

When we arrived we went straight to queue for the tram ride, but we were not aware that the shows finish early. So we came off the tram, to find both shows weren't now running.

For us the price of the ticket was not worth the effort as you can't see all of the animals as it's too dark. Photos can't be taken with a flash and not enough to justify the price.

Won't be recommending unfortunately."
,,A truly unique experience!,5.0,,"This Night Safari is a truly one of a kind way to see the animals, especially the nocturnal ones that really come alive at night like bats as well as some of the rarer animals from down under that one might not get to see in this lifetime.

The tram ride is fantastic and the guides are incredibly entertaining as they talk you through each animal sighting but also take the time to walk through the many trails of the zoo and you're sure to see several really amazing animals come alive at night."
,,different tgan usual....,4.0,,"This was a different experience as zoo comes by 6 pm everywhere.
Both shows were good. We managed to be there from Jurong east station by bus and it was fully loaded with tourists as for year end. We had a huge q to clear for entrance but it was moving steadily. The opted for a vehicle inside the park as had old aged person accompanying us. However the walking trail seems to be more fascinating.

Must visit for everyone."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"First time for me but at least the fourth visit for my husband who visited Singapore on business lots of times. We went on a organised trip arranged by our hotel, I would recommend this as when you come out the queues for the taxi's are really long and you also have to wait for the public transport. You have enough time to go on the train and walk around but it's better to eat before you go as not enough time to eat in the restaurant or do what we did and have a hot dog from a cafe on one of the walks, quicker. Would definitely recommend it and will go again on our next visit."
,,Same animals different experience,4.0,,We went to the main zoo and then went to the night safari after a small break for dinner. The same sort of animals suddenly took on another perspective at night that was very interesting. The show is excellent and should not be missed.
,,"lots of animals, great tour",4.0,,"Night safari Singapore - lots of animals to see, got there at 8pm and went straight on the tram tour which lasts 40minutes. The show was good, small animals. It's a bus ride from Singapore centre so plan in an hour travel time. Opened at 7pm until midnight, however bear in mind the last bus times are earlier. Taxis are plentiful, note. 50% increase in fares after midnight"
,,Good evening entertainment,4.0,,"A very enjoyable evening, good family entertainment. The set up is very similar to Disney Animal Kingdom so if you have done that it is not so different. The fire eating dancers were amazing and the Creatures of the Night show was very entertaining for all ages! We went on a Monday evening so was less busy. I would imagine weekends wouldbe quite frantic. I would suggest you aim to go to the safari first if you can get the timings right otherwise go to the show and leave a few minutes before the end to get into line for the trams. We did not have a meal but others said expensive for the quality. I think for this event it is better to go with a tour group as you get priority at the line."
,,Night zoo mistake,3.0,,"We did the night zoo which was recommended but, on reflection, we wish we had visited during the day. It is all down to personal ideas. We saw some animals but madea mistake by getting off the tram at the only point you could. I would recommend people stay on the tram then walk around the park afterwards."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"We went on a saturday night which meant a 45 min wait in a queue to board the safari tram. Although it was dark, we could manage to see most animals as we got off at all the 3 trails to walk around in the park. In order for you to have a smooth experience suggest the following :
1. Go on a weekday nite but not Friday.
2. take a corner seat on the safari tram for better animal views
3. Walk around all the trails as you may miss some critical animals if u remain on the tram. The leopards, mini kangaroos(i forgot their name), owls, squirrels etc. The trams move fast and maybe faster on weekends.
overall an enjoyable experience as you get to see lions , tigers , elephants , giraffes , rhino and other creatures from very close quarters.Carry a pair of binocs with night vision, if possible."
,,Something Different!,4.0,,I found it something different not having done any such activity anywhere so am certainly not bale to compare. But for first timers it definitely gives you a high! Of Course the Night Safari is all in a controlled environment but the thrill lies in the idea hich the theme park is able to impart.... that the animals are accessible and not very far. It's notches above a Disney World experience and I would give special points to the experience of getting down the tram and exploring the animal trails in dead of night. Truly enjoyable!!:)
,,Couldn't see most of the Animals. They were all hiding in the dark.,3.0,,We had great difficulty seeing the animals as they were hiding in the shadows among the trees. It could have better lighting and possibly make the visit more exciting and interesting. I don't think it is worth the visit.
,,Experience something new,5.0,,Unique experience. It's not just walk through but much more. All so little bit scary. I my self had a little scared when a Malaysian tapir came close to me and started sniffing me.
,,Nocturnal outing,4.0,,"Great tour, but don't be disappointed if you miss some animals as the buses don't go that slow. Busy busy, so make sure you are in a tour group to get priority ticketing. Good choice of eateries too"
,,great evening,4.0,,"Bought tickets online to avoid having to queue.
Not all animals were out, but many were.
We were tired after the day zoo, so caught the tram. The tour guide was good, and the tram stops at each enclosure as it passes.
It was cooler at night, and was raining on and off, so the tram was good.
Tired at the end, so only did one walk trail, but it was worth it - we watched some wildcats trying to catch fish at the water's edge - great to see them in their natural habitat.
Watched one of the shows put on by the staff - well worth watching, with some humour injected. Highly recommended."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"This trip we did the night safari. And am so glad we did. What a different and relaxing way to visit the animals for both them and us.
I suggest you book it through a tour guide as it gives you the opportunity to jump the queue which can be a positive thing when you see the length of the entry lines."
,,"avoid ""creatures of the night""",4.0,,"we wasted time and energy at the night safari by sitting through the cheesy show ""creatures of the night."" better to spend your time on the walking trails and tram ride than watching some lucky kid get chosen to hold a snake."
,,Great Zoo by day and night,4.0,,"Unfortunately due to rain some of the attractions (boat ride) were closed so be prepared for that.

Really lovely zoo, wandered by day and then went and did the night zoo, as to be expected you struggle to see but still worth a go, little eery wandering round a zoo at night hearing noises and seeing nothing but fun.

Had breakfast with the orangutans which wasn't what I expected. The orangutans sit on a platform eating while you queue to stand in front of them and have your photo taken and then have to get out of other peoples way. Preferred the Borneo Sanctuarys for that aspect"
,,Had lot of expectations but not matched,3.0,,"Went in with lot of expectations but it was disappointment ..taken the tram ride rather than walking and felt that i should have done day safari rather than night safari .. Looks like animals are trained to stand in front of you rather than natural

Positive - The shows"
,,It was ok,3.0,,"This was a little disappointing, I did see quite a few animals but it wasn't anything special. I did a tour and my guide was a little bit too quick around the part that you walk. If you go on a tour then you don't have to wait in the line for the train that takes you around past all the animals"
,,Great night for kids and adults,4.0,,"This is a well established attraction with lots of details available on the web. However a few tips, book online and get a pick up en route to the Night Safari included in the price - including pick up and return about $42. Get the earliest pick up and ensure on time for pick up or early for guaranteed seat, pay in advance!!!!! Once at the park get straight into the tram queue and eat before you go to the pick up or after the tour which takes about an hour. You can get off half way and walk amongst the Animals on safe trail ways. There are additional free attractions such as the fire shows and sales outlets for usual souvenirs, not too expensive. Would suggest the alternative is combine a zoo day visit with Night Safari as we have done previously."
,,Must be on the To-Watch list of Singapore,5.0,,"If you have not been in a Night Safari, you have missed a great opportunity. One of the coolest thing that I did was going for Night Safari. Also, the fire show before the Night Safari starts is fun. You should take out the entire day for covering Zoo, River Cruise and Night Safari."
,,Average,3.0,,Saw animals in the night. Not allowed to go out from the tram. Good to have the experience one time. I can remember their are buses starting from the nearby bus stand. And their were buses until late night. But make sure to plan you trip properly because their may be no trains after midnight. So you have to take the cabs :)
,,naturalistic,5.0,,"The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore. Occupies 90 acres of secondary rain forest adjacent to the Singapore Zoo and Reservoir. The Night Safari currently houses over 2,500 animals representing over 130 species, of which 35% are threatened species. The Night Safari is an entire open-air zoo set in a humid tropical forest that is only open at night. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram. I recommended the tram, but be warned of the huge crowds, the queues are rather long for the first tram. The animals of the Night Safari, are made visible by lighting that resembles moonlight., the naturalistic enclosures simulate the animals' native habitat. Animals are separated from visitors with natural barriers, , similar to the Singapore Zoo's open concept. Instead of vertical prison-like cages, cattle grids were laid all over the park to prevent hoofed animals from moving one habitat to another. Channels were designed to look like streams and rivers to enable fishing cats to be put on show in open areas, and hot wires are designed to look like twigs to keep animals away from the boundaries of their enclosures. Most enjoyable was also the Performances such as tribal dances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. It is certainly one of the best and educational places to visit Highly recommended."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Wonderful Experience in Night safari watching all the wild animals . Even though it was crowded , we enjoyed and the experience"
,,Amazingly kept and maintained...,4.0,,It was very well managed and very well kept also... the cleanliness and the thought of arranging it in such a way is really commendable.. The Lion is stunning to watch... and we got to see it roar in a very picturesque manner which was icing on the cake... a good experience...
,,Really good!,4.0,,"Spending a night with the nocturnal animals at the Night Safari is definitely worth it. Eventhough the lineups are long, the shows organised by the staff are really entertaining and worth the time."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"This is a very unique & amazing experience - you get to observe so many animals up close & personal in their natural habitat doing their own thing. There are lions, tiger, giraffe, hyena and lot more to watch. The short show called 'Creatures of the Night' is interesting too.

Tip : walk instead of tram ride for better look at animals."
,,Very enjoyable - but don't go with Luxury Tours!,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the Night Safari - once we actually got onto the tram. Up until that point it was a near disaster. We booked with Luxury Tours which was such a mistake. We were told we'd be picked up at 5.15pm but they didn't show until 5.45pm and the tour itself was supposed to start at 6pm. After doing a heap of other pick ups we were finally on the road about 6.30pm. The guide ""Johnson"" was terrible. He had no idea what he was doing, was culturally insensitive and couldn't handle pressure.
There was an option with the tour to get an Indian buffet dinner but due to the lateness, there was no time. When we got to the zoo we were told to follow him and he'd get the tickets but not to talk to him or ask him any questions because he needed to concentrate! He used this line several times. He took forever to get the tickets and as we were already late this meant that me missed the animal show which he said was best to do first to avoid the lines at the tram. So we had to get into lines at the tram which were packed by this point. The zoo was lovely and we were much more relaxed when we got to that point, although we didn't have any time to look around the zoo at all, just did the tram and the animal show. After the animal show we were leaving but a fire breathing show started so we stopped to watch. after a while my husband and I went over to Johnson and some of the other people on the tour did too. He decided that since 75% of the group were there we could leave and if the others didn't notice then too bad, they could taxi home. Those were his words. On the way back, the bus stopped and we were transferred into different taxis to take us home which was weird, and I wondered if it was because it was about 10.30pm at that point.
One of the worst parts was that the leader hadn't allowed for, and in fact made it impossible to have a toilet stop, a drink stop or to get anything to eat. Considering the tour for us started at 5.15pm (even though they didn't pick us up until much later - still no explanation as to why) and ended up being a 5 hour tour, we found this to be unacceptable. There were many children on the tour and the parents had intended on doing the Indian buffet. The driver took them to a place called Mustafa on the way home but that meant that the kids (and their parents) weren't eating until 11pm. Not sure what you would have done if you had already paid for the dinner part. Worst tour and tour guide I've ever had!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,This is defiantly the best zoo experience I have had. Very very well done. You feel like there is nothing between you and the animals. Great fun!
,,Not worth effort,2.0,,"We loved our trip to Singapore, but there were two attractions about which we had heard only the most wonderful things from other Americans and both were hugely disappointing - Sentosa and this Night Safari. The Night Safari felt tacky and touristy without any offsetting benefit of tremendous animals or great observation. As a comparison, the safari at Disney's Animal Kingdom is a world's better experience in every regard."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"we decided to do the night safari which in hindsight may not have been the best time to visit. It was very busy with long queues to get onto the buses which take you around. There isn't really a lot of different animals to see with quite a few different species of deer taking centre stage. There are a couple of lions, elephants and giraffes interspersed but we were a little disappointed. The show was quite good with a variety of different animals on show including a raccoon, very clever otters, snakes and wolves. Ensure you use mozzie repellent if you go at night as we were bitten. Food is quite expensive so it would pay to eat before heading there. We caught the MRT to Ang Mo Kio and caught a bus from there to the Zoo which was very efficient. If you do decide to do this though, ensure you leave the zoo by 11pm at the latest to get the bus back to the MRT, otherwise you may miss the last train and be stranded."
,,Different experience,3.0,,The setting was different to what normally used to when visiting zoo's or nature reserves in the daytime. No queues as we had the excursion pre-booked. When on the tram/bus it honesty felt I was in the middle of Jurassic Park. The quietness of the ride with nighttime wildlife noises and staring at animals in their night time setting. It made for a different and memorable experience although not the most exciting and limited stopping time to take in the sights.
,,A great experience but can be marred by long queues and waiting times,4.0,,"My 5 year old son and I visited between Christmas and New Year while on a short break in Singapore. There are clear positives: a unique night time zoo experience (as far as we know, still the only one in the world) as well as visiting in the evenings when both the temperature and the humidity are less oppressive. But one potential deal breaking negative: Epic queues.

Our experience:
- Animal exhibits were by and large exciting, well presented and showed the animals to good effect, which is challenging given the lack of light - we were concerned that many animals would be hidden in obscure parts of their enclosures but our experience was that all the animals were up and about and very prominent during our visit
- The park offers quite a wide variety of animals but majors on South East Asian natives, so expect a lot of deer and buffaloes but also we were very pleased to see the majors like tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes etc
- The visit can be done via a walk or a tram-ride (we did the walk first, since there was almost no queue, compared to the tram ride)
- Lots of places to eat and drink, although this significantly increases the visit time due to the waiting times

The key negatives were:
- The queues are epic and can bring out the worst in people -: think Disneyland at peak times and 2-3 hours just to get into the park and you'll get the idea. Be psychologically prepared to deal with queue jumpers, whingers, grumblers, etc. It can be quite trying, especially when you are with young children who are excited, sat in a long line and then see the worst of human behaviour all around you....
Avoid public holidays and arrive early
- Even thought it's the evening, you still work up quite a sweat, especially on the walk
- Mosquitoes can be a problem, so be prepared, especially for the little ones (long sleeves and trousers and insect repellent)
- Toilets are clean and well maintained but quite spaced out through the park, so do plan ahead
- Have an exit plan (the queue for taxis and buses adds another 30 mins to an hour easily to the visit)

Staff were in general excellent (but are at a loss to deal with upset guests - they seem trained to avoid confrontation so our experience was sadly that loud, aggressive types get surreptitiously bumped up the queue - do consider this strategy if you have the stomach for it.

All in all, it was well worth the visit, especially since my 5 year old really enjoyed the novelty of being able to stay up late and seeing the animals in a different context. It is quite a different zoo experience, especially for fans of the nocturnal animals.

We planned ahead, but were still caught out by the queues. We spent 4 hours at the park, 2 actually seeing things (albeit rather rapidly) and 2 in the queues to get in and out... you have been warned!"
,,A fun family evening,3.0,,This is a really fun place to visit as a family but be warned the queues can be crazy (never go on a public holiday). There are walking tours but its not always that well lit on some of the paths so the train rides are recomended
,,Not what I expected,2.0,,This zoo is in need of many upgrades. If you go just do the night zoo tour. Also if you like primates this is the place as this what they specialize in. Lions and tigers not out as we went mid afternoon. I feel this attraction was over priced. Many other places to spend your money.
,,Very good.,4.0,,"Lot's of animals were out & about, so this was a very pleasant and relaxing way to see them at night. I was really disappointed in the behavior of some of the tourists on this tour. Surely after saying no flash photography 10 times, people might take notice. The tour takes about 30 minutes. It isn't cheap, but it is good."
,,Listen to Trip Advisor advice!,4.0,,"We visited the Night Safari last week and had a mixed experience. We should have heeded the advice of Trip Advisor writers who warned about the huge crowds on the first trams and suggested walking a trail first. If we had followed their advice, we would not have spent 45 minutes queuing up in a crowded, hot area! However, as we had come to the zoo as part of a City Tour, we were on a relatively short timeline and felt the tram tour was our most important priority! Once we got on the tram, however, we enjoyed the experience of seeing a wide range of animals in close proximity. We saw the Creatures of the Night Show which was enjoyable but rather brief and also did a very quick walk along the trail where the fishing cats were located before rushing to the bus. This was very interesting and we would have loved to have ventured along the other walking trails. I believe that if we had been able to spend more time at the zoo we would have enjoyed the experience a lot more as it certainly is a unique venue. So, if you are planning a trip there, make sure you heed the advice of fellow Trip Advisors to avoid the lengthy tram delays which soured our experience!"
,,Must see,5.0,,"We did the night zoo and it's an experience that you must have, you might have to wait a while to get your turn however it's worth it. There is also a day safari that you can do."
,,Ideal for families,4.0,,"One of the best places to visit if you are with your family.You can opt to ride in the train or walk.Walking takes a lot longer but is equally enjoyable in the cool shade in the otherwise hot singapore.The animals are amazingly close to the train and they have a wide gamut of species as well.
Highlights are the night show and the fire dance.Highly recommended."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Brilliant we did the NIGHT SAFARI it was so much fun, the shows were a little corney but get on the train and go around this zoo at night in the dark it was incredible you have to do it !"
,,Good attraction,4.0,,"This is a great place to visit, however I would suggest doing the Zoo and Night Safari different days, we did it all in the one day and by the time you get to the night safari you are very tired so we felt we rushed through it as we have been on the go all day then in to the night. Also night safari attracts large bus groups so very busy compared to the zoo.

The zoo shuts at 6pm so you have to sit around to 730for night safari to open, the fast food outlets are terrible, they only stock limited amount of food."
,,A little boring with only 1 memorable highlight. Too expensive for its offering.,3.0,,"One of two main attractions was the tram tour which is a little disorganised and very late. The pre-entrance fire show was great to deflect the fact of waiting at the entrance queue. The Creature of the Night show is quite fun, amazing and edifying. The host was very good as well. Plenty of hawker style dining inside the grounds."
,,Very good experience for those who have patience,4.0,,"First of all transportation to reach this place should be arranged beforehand to avoid unnecessary expense on taxi or long bus journey. The place is way too crowded with enthusiastic tourists as well as zealous locals. Hence, one needs lot of patience and physical fitness to be in the long queue. But I must admit, the perseverance pays off, since the tram ride through the semidarkness of the artificial rain forest with its different habitats freely roaming within arm length is quite an experience. The crisp and clear announcements by the on board guide also helps to identify the animals. There are walking tours and some shows also available for those who would like to spend longer time inside."
,,Way too touristy,2.0,,"all the animals stood to attention for the thousands of tourists. The Japanese seemed to enjoy themselves though. Much preferred the Chon Buri Open zoo in Thailand. You can actually feed and pat Rhinos, elephants and heaps of other animals"
,,Still a nice experience,4.0,,"Went there 12 years ago during our honeymoon and recently went back with our son. Still the same pleasant experience. However, although convenient, it took us 1hr to get there by riding the SMRT and bus."
,,"a great experience but be prepared for a very, very, very long wait for the bus tour!",4.0,,"....I say be prepared for a loooonnngggg wait for the tram tour but that is not the fault of the organisers or park rangers- it is because it this is such a popular thing to do in Singapore that thousands of people come on the same night. That said, the event was very well regulated and the tram doing the night safari made a very enjoyable ride. There are also four basic walking trails which are around a 20-20 minute walk per trial.

The night time adds to the overall great ambiance of seeing the wildlife and one of the best views for me was seeing a massive lion fast asleep on a rock! I would definitely recommend this safari and there is also an impressive food court with worldwide cuisine for people to fill their stomachs after the safari."
,,Bring your night vision glasses,2.0,,"If you intend to go to the safari, make sure you get there earlier especially if you have young children because it is quite far away from the main part of Singapore.

We arrived there just before 9pm, which was far too late. We were encouraged to see their late night show to make it more value for money which started at 9.30pm. Those were the words from some of the staff there! So by the time we got in the tram car it was way past 10pm. The tram car ride was a good experience with your own guide, but it went through the park quickly and being at night, it was difficult to see the animals. It would have been better if the guide allowed the tram to stop for a few minutes to allow the people to spot the animals! Secondly, at times she didn't mention the animals that we were meant to look at it, so most of the time, we were guessing ourselves!

By the time the safari finished, both my kids were already asleep, and we had to go home.

So for the $100 or so that we paid, we got to see only a handful of animals and half hour tram ride! Definitely not worth the money!"
,,A very unique experience,5.0,,"If you want to give Night Safari a miss cuz you have visited numerous sanctuaries and parks and never spotted anything more than deer, rework your schedule. You can't afford to overlook this place.

The Night Safari starts only after dusk around 7. We had a long queue to follow to get inside the tram for the safari but the experience was worth the wait. The tram doesn't just take you through the area recklessly but has a sketched out path and is equipped with guides who make announcements and help you spot animals. I dunno how to categorize this attraction as it is not a wildlife for animals can be seen in zones where their names and species are marked on signage and neither can it be called a zoo as they are not caged. So unlike wildlife sanctuaries where you are not sure of spotting animals, here you can be.

There are hippopotamus, bears, leopards, elephants, deer of a lotta varieties, porcupines and even lions in the open. Some animals are kept behind thick glass protection and not bars. Leopard is one of them. You can easily see them play and fight. The lions are fed meat at 9.00 pm and the guides give you an option to get off the tram to see the keepers feed lions. This is a sight. So now you walk through the jungle dimly lit and full of animals but there is no threat at all. You are supposedly safe! We saw the two men from the place feeding the lions at hardly 25m distance! There are wallabies there too! You are precisely traveling through a jungle where animals are all around you but they are kinda ignoring you ;)

There are enclosures housing fruit bats and flying squirrels. The entry to these is creepy and enough to freak you out. But when you enter, you will see bats at one hand distance hanging upside down. That is quite a sight.

At 9.30 there is a cute animal show which we saw many people missing. You can't do that. There are some very awwwwwy and nice performances by otters, hyenas, etc which should not be missed. Again the hostess here dressed as a ranger is very interactive and makes you part of everything. The show is something i had never seen.

Again you get pictures clicked and buy them for SGD 25 if you want. This is a standard custom in Singapore."
,,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! Do something else!!,1.0,,"We took the public transport to get there, it took about 1.5 hours (MRT and bus).
There were a lot of people (the place was full of people) and we had to stand in line for more than 80 minutes. People started to push each other and some visitors from one country (which country I do not want to name now…) really pushed themselves forward in the lines. The place was not well organized, once we got on the open electric train, people were shouting (to each other and to their kids) and using flash to take a photos of the animals.... You cannot use the flash, it was indicated so many times but they simply did not care. It was impossible to enjoy this ""tour"".
I would never again try such a safari, because it was a waste of time. Truly, it was our worst day in Singapore!"
,,Great attraction,4.0,,"My friends and I went on an organised tour to the night safari in the zoo. We were picked up from the Bay Hotel and taken by large coach to the zoo. It was very busy upon arrival into the park but as we were part of a tour group we only had a very short wait for the shiw and the tram. The first show in the open air ampitheatre was very enjoyable, with great commentary given about each animal that came into the area, the white wolf howled for everyone, and all the other animals in the show had names and were all very well trained, the tiny otters even picked up the recycling items off the ground and placed them back into the bin.
The tram drove through the forest and we saw many animals, some of them hiding, but most of them were very easy to see. Again very good commentary regarding each species as we came up to them and the lion even roared for us.
As with most tourist atttractions, the food was expensive, especially the gelato ice creams. There was quite a good selection of food in the various outlets. We were there from 6pm until just after 10pm when our coach returned to the city."
,,Night zoo!!!,5.0,,"We visited the night zoo. It is amazing how well they prepared this experience. You see the night active animals and you have the opportunity to have a walk though the tropical forest. Actually, it's a save option to discover the forest by night (I would never have a walk through a tropical forest by night with all that animals :) )"
,,Great for seeing animals at night.,4.0,,"Great place to visit with a family, Missy really enjoyed seeing the animals at night.
Try and get up the front on the tram, we were on the second tram at the back row and every time it stop we seemed to be blocked by big trees. Guide was very knowable. Great seeing the animals active, and some were very active!
We would have loved to have done a walk down the back by ourselves but couldn't as we were pushed for time as we were on a tour.
I can highly recommend this, I don't think their are any other places like this in the world. I could be wrong!"
,,New attraction,5.0,,"We visited the night safari some ten years ago. Read about the new attraction so we thought we might pay a visit. Received on average 3,000 visitors a night. Worthwhile joining one of the two tour groups that have priority access to the tram - otherwise be prepared to spend up to couple of hours for tickets and tram access. Worthwhile getting there early when the animals come out to feed. Most enjoyable."
,,World Class,5.0,,"Don’t miss this world class attraction. We started out by entering the park at 6 pm and took a table at a cafe and had a meal. That allows you to start walking at 7 pm and you can see animals not covered by the route of the night train. This approach seems to keep children interested in what is a long night. Then the Creatures of the Night Show at around 8.30 pm and finally a train ride, surely the highlight. You have to queue for this so make sure you have drinks or eats to distract children. The night Zoo is best seen when there has been a rain free day, if you can manage that. The best thing is that most animals of interest to children are either inactive or invisible during daylight, but this experience captures them out in full sight."
,,place for package tourists,3.0,,"a ususal tourist attraction. animal lovers can go but if u r not into animals, avoid. log queues for the train ride. should go early around 4. far from singapore. but connectivity is good. buses and cabs. cab fare around 20 sgd from centre."
,,Highly Recommended,4.0,,"If anything, this experience is well worth it. The tour is done at night on a tram, but the animals are clearly visible. The tour guide is clear and knowledgeable. There are rhinos and elephants and they are up close. My kids were amazed and so was I. I've been times already..."
,,Not worth the price,3.0,,"Not what I expected. Long line(even on a weekday which I went) to watch the creatures of the night show. Had no crowd control. They should have just let people come inside instead of closing it and keep people waiting to cause a crowd. The show barely had any interesting animals and the bigger animals they showed such as the wolf and Hienna were in the far back behind a wire fenced- couldn't see properly and each one came out for maybe 45 seconds. The rest were smaller animals such as otters and raccoons... Commentary was good though.

(I suggest starting with the show since the tram lines would be a long wait due to everyone running there first)

For the tram- it was a long line (even on a weekday). The ride was interesting but not impressive. 85% of the time they showed different type of deers over and over(they all looked the same to me tho). The animals that were suppose to be nocturnal was sleeping such as the elephant, lion, hippos, etc. so barely seen any of them(probably because they all have a small the space are provided to roam around, they seemed depressed). I suggest sitting in the 2nd tram (the middle) so when passing by you'll hear the commentary before it's too late. IF you sit all the way in the front the commentator will start late and you'll miss out on the animals and If you sit in the last one, you won't be able to see the animals because they'll stop where the trees are blocking the view. The tram did move too fast to even get a good look at the animals and can't take any pictures since flash isn't allowed and it too dark.

Couple trail walks was cool, the leopards were behind a glass wall which was kind of sad seeing how small the space were. coolest part was walking through the bat cave where they're flying over your head and right in front of you!

The best show that there was, was the Fire show. Food was really good like the bong burgers. My mother enjoyed the fish and chips they had.

Overall if you never been to a night Safari then its a good place to start but Its not the best. Price was way too high for what it was worth"
,,An Open Safari!!,4.0,,"Could be various animals such the Asiatic and African lions, hyenas, wolves, deers, elephants, giraffe, zebra, panther at a very close distance and of course the Striped Tiger from a glass shield :-)"
,,Amazing,5.0,,The night safari is in Singapore zoo itself but the difference is it is at night. There are amazing animals shows and shops. The night safari is truly epic. The ambience is super epic.
,,A unique safari adventure from the comfort of a tram,5.0,,"The Singapore Zoo is beautiful, clean and people friendly despite enormous size. The night safari is a unique experience. Seeing wild animals-large ones- in a natural habitat -cleverly but not obtrusively illuminated -from the safety of a tram is a lovely and educational experience. Beautifully landscaped. Clean as can be. And very interesting. The tour guides (we went twice) were knowledgeable and charming. Would go again in a heartbeat."
,,"Kids say 4, parents 3-3.5!",4.0,,"The kids rated it a bit more highly than Mum and Dad (11,14 year old boys). We are a family of animal lovers and don't love seeing animals trained to do things they really shouldn't be doing, or locked in cages. As zoos go this one looks much better than most. Many animals one doesn't usually get to see especially awake. The conservation message is good even if a bit kitschy like some of the commentary. It was very crowded when we went (Friday night) and we waited 45 minutes to board the tram ride but it was very efficiently organized. The Creatures of the Night show was sweet, no riding bikes by creatures not designed to do so but the kids would have liked it to be longer!"
,,They look different at night !!!,4.0,,It's a different concept altogether to watch animals in the darkness of the night and this is what Nught Safari offers. The animal shows are quite thrilling and the tram ride is awesome. Overall worth a visit for sure !!!
,,A different experience,5.0,,Seeing nocturnal animals is a must see. Tour was well organised and informative. Really enjoyed the Nigh Safari.
,,Hot Sticky but a Good Experience,3.0,,"A very good idea but in places poorly executed, with some animals unseen and some very close to the tram the enclosures were either too big for the animal or way to small, like in the case of the lion and the point made with other reviews about sometimes the predators and prey being very close.
All in all a good trip
Would definitely recommend mosquito repellant, water (very hot and humid), and even a snack depending on the time as the food stores in the safari are very expensive."
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,"I was a little hesitant after some reviews I read, but WOW! It was an amazing night from start to finish. Up close experience with the animals, loved the walk through bat flight. Well worth the night, seen animals I have never seen. The buffet dinner was OK, but it was all about the animals."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"Go on the ""train"" and save lots of walking in the dark. Worth going on an organised coach tour to
save having to wait for hours. You get V.I.P. treatment and therefore go to a separate entrance. Do not go if it is raining. No cover."
,,Intriguing Experiencemessage,3.0,,"An interesting experience. I'm not sure if it's because I visited the zoo first. After reading earlier reviews I wished I did the walking trails and then do the trams. If you want to do the trams be prepared for a scramble to get your seat on your team.

The staff, the guide on our tram gave very clear instructions re use of camera flashes yet still people continued to use their cameras with flashes on

I really enjoyed the tram ride, the commentary and the conservation message that came across. Seeing the animals not behind bars supposedly and our tram passing bar was definitely an experience.

Tip - tours don't start till 7pm not 6 pm I was told. Heaps of time to explore, have a bite to eat before taking the tram"
,,Bizarre place!,3.0,,"I have mixed feelings about the night safari. You pay your entry fee and then head for the tram that takes you around a road with seemingly uncaged animals on either side. You can jump off half way round a walk through ""the rain forest"" and get a closer and more prolonged look at some of the animals. As it's dark, it is difficult to gauge the size of the enclosures, but some of them (particularly elephant, hippo and big cat) appear a bit small.

The guided tour touches on conservation, but it is basically ""look to the left and you will see a herd of deer, then look to your left and see their main predator, the hyena"".

Personally, I wasn't that impressed, but the concept is interesting as the only night zoo in the world."
,,You have to go!!,5.0,,This was one of the high lights of my trip. A great way to see nocturnal animals up close. A definite when in singapore. I would recommend walking the trails first add every one lines up for the tram first. After the walking trail we did the creatures of the night show. When we came out the tram line was empty. There are shuttles that go there for about $7 aus dollars each way. Just ask the concierge at the hotel your staying as they came by across the road from our hotel. You can buy tickets on the shuttle to.
,,Another side of the zoo,4.0,,"This would be a good experience for families. Off course see the zoo first during the day, to see most of the animals. More animals are more aware during the night as that's when they should hunt for food. But off course this is still a zoo, so don't expect a safari experience here."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Visited in September 2013. This was an amazing experience seeing animals at night, I would recommend seeing the show first then walk around the park then get on the tram as the queue will die down by then. Some of the animals were hard to see but this can't be helped. I will definitely be returning when I am back in Singapore. We got the 4 in 1 deal (Zoo, River, Night and Bird) which meant it was quite good value; we did the river safari and night safari in one day which worked nicely but was quite tiring. We had burgers from Bongo Bongo Burgers which were good but fairly expensive."
,,Mixed feelings,3.0,,"We had 24 hours in Singapore and decided to go straight to the Night Safari when we were arrived. This saved time but we left with mixed feelings. The animals appear well looked after but are probably bored and don't appreciate having the lights on at night. Like most things in Singapore the facilities are impeccably clean, modern and well maintained. There are a lot of interesting Asian animals at the zoo as well as the usual big cats. You can see lion and tiger feedings as well as other animal shows and a dance performance. There is a tram around the zoo which passes all exhibits but the waiting time is very long (2hours on the saturday night we visited). You can walk past most of the exhibits, but the pathways can get crowded especially near the big cats. Unfortunately the zoo is a fair way out of town and entry is a bit pricey ($42 Singapore per adult)."
,,ok if you like to see animals in the Dark:),3.0,,"that is why its night safari huh! if you like to see animals that you haven't seen for real then don't go here, just go to the Singapore Zoo lots of animals and they are awake hehe we didnt see much here it was either theyre hiding or sleeping so if you only want to see what's night safari is and just for experience like us then you can check it out :)"
,,The Night Safari is a must see!,5.0,,"I Went to the Zoo with a group of friends in my tourism class and it was so well run and clean, the animals are happy and seem to be treated well which makes me really happy, the experience is more about entering their environment and respecting them rather than gawking at them through cages. This is definitely my favorite Zoo.
Food and drinks are over priced though, which they are at any zoo! so pack a snack!"
,,OK If You Have Good Night Vision,3.0,,"Very mixed feelings about this as the low levels of light required meant we could hardly see some animals on the tram trip.
Highlight was walking thru the trails, watching the mouse deer and being entertained by the otters who stood on their rear legs and seemed to chorus ‘Feed me’ when we approached.
Don’t buy beer there -$27 for two bottles –absolute rip off, but we were thirsty at the end of the walk.
Wear plenty of mossie repellent. We were on a tour, which included an excellent buffet meal, and sadly had to be back at the coach by 10pm. We could have spent a lot longer walking the trails as it is open to midnight. My advice is to get pre booked tickets and meal, do the tram, then the trails and get the taxi back to town later, probably about $25.
We didn't do the shows, preferring to walk the trails."
,,Great alternate Zoo Experience,5.0,,"This is a chance to see night animals in a natural setting, take a tram tour then walk around at your leisure observing what the various animals do when they come out at night.

Just remember if you are tacking photos NO FLASH or LIGHT FOCUS SENSORS are permitted."
,,Surprisingly good - make sure you do walk before tram ride,5.0,,"the reviews were mixed so wasn't sure how much we would like this - but were very pleasantly surprised. The set up is great with just enough lighting to see where you are going - and plenty of animals to see all out and about feeding.

Would definitely walk the trails first as the queues for tram rides when the park opens were ridiculous. We walked the four trails (about 20 mins each and easy walk) - by time we came back there was no line up for the team and we jumped straight on. The tram takes you to some different parts not accessible on foot so worth doing.

We got there at around 6.30 and had dinner (delicious noodles and duck set - $19) in the restaurant area. Advertised opening is 7.30 pm but they were letting people in from around 7.15pm. We spent almost 3 hours as we also waited for lion feeding at 8pm.

Great experience - different being in a zoo at night time and very different experience to normal. Not sure why this isn't more highly rated (perhaps the time waiting for tram if you do that first??)"
,,Exciting,3.0,,It was a nice experience. Saw lots.the walks were nice. The mascots were friendly. Night creature show was very nice. Remember to carry mosquito repellant. Meals are very expensive. Highly recommended.
,,Cool zoo experience but watch out for long lines,4.0,,"One part of Singapore Zoo is called the Night Safari and does not open until 7 pm. They have a good show with night-living animals and some walking routes and also the night safari train. The train really brings you up close to animals!

Lines for the train can be really long (1,5 - 2 hours!) and if you find yourself in that situation - do what we did. Walk the one hour trail, go see the show, grab something to eat and then finish with the train when there's no line. That was a much better way to spend two hours... Oh, and bring mosquito repellent!"
,,Memorable tram ride,5.0,,"This was our first stop in Singapore after hotel check-in. We rode the MRT to Ang Mo Kio then took Bus 138 (40 min bus ride) to Night Safari.

We went on Dec 10, a Wed. The park opened at 7:30PM but we arrived a few minutes after 8PM so the early crowd had already gone inside. We spent a good 15 mins taking pics at the entrance plaza and courtyard before we finally headed to the main entrance. We showed our e-tickets, passed the turnstiles and went straight to nearby tram station 1. We did not even realize we were not handed any park maps by the staff.

There was no line up at tram station 1. We got choice seats on the next tram which arrived after a 10 min wait. We picked the last row of the 2nd car so every time the tour guide said “To your left… To your right…” we had time to do a quick scan and see the animals before they were directly to our left or right. I would say mid-row of 2nd car all the way to the last row of 3rd car would be a good spot. Do not sit in the lead (1st) car with the tour guide.

The tram ride, which lasted about 40 mins, was a visual treat and a memorable experience. I have been to Night Safari many years ago so I know what to expect. My companions were fascinated. Who wouldn’t be? Imagine, a night zoo where you get to ride an open-air tram in the dark and see wild animals as they go about their business, sometimes almost within reach? And yes, at one point we did say it was like being in Jurassic Park, particularly while passing by a long, dark stretch of thicket.

Flash photography is prohibited so as not to disturb the animals. One stubborn tourist in the 3rd car got reprimanded by the tour guide. I tried taking pics with my DSLR camera using very high ISO speed but most pics still came out blurry. I guess I should have expected that since not only was the lighting less than ideal, the tram was in constant motion.

We only stayed 1 ½ hrs. We didn’t get to watch the Creatures of the Night show or walk along any of the trails. Still, even with just the tram ride, we had an enjoyable time at Night Safari. Highly recommended."
,,Up close and personal with the animals,4.0,,"I loved the night safari!

It felt like there were no barriers between you and the animals at the night safari (except for the tiger). The tram ride was a good experience - just sitting there and enjoying looking at the animals with a conductor on board to give a brief summary of each animal.

After the tram ride, we walked through the trails as well which allowed you to pace yourself and look at the animals you were interested in.

We started queuing up for the tram an hour before the park officially opened. I would recommend that you line up as well to avoid lengthy waits.

Loved the creature of the night show - it was cute and spontaneous.

I would recommend the night safari as a place to visit in Singapore."
,,An Exciting Experience,5.0,,"I've been here a couple of times before, but I still found the entire experience to be quite exciting. To some visitors, it might seem like a zoo but at night, with nocturnal creatures, however, I felt that the open enclosures (only the more friendly herbivores) along the tram route was a magnificent touch because the animals could literally walk a few inches from you during the tram ride. One wouldn't find this sort of experience in a zoo.

The park is split into 3 sections in my opinion: the 40-minute tram ride, the 4 walking trails (which are interconnected), and the ""Creatures of the Night"" show (optional I feel). I suggest going for the walking trails first before going for the tram ride because the queues for the ride are quite long at the beginning of the night. As for the walking trails, it might be difficult for some handicapped visitors as there are some of slopes along the way. The tram route and the walking trails showcase different animals, but there will be a handful of overlaps. I guess the walking trails are for the smaller creatures, and the tram ride is for the larger ones, except for the Leopard.

In addition, the staff were extremely helpful and patient. While venturing through the 4 walking trails, rangers were stationed at intersections to guide visitors along in case anyone lost their way. Handicapped visitors are well taken care off, as seen from experience with my grandmother who is in a wheelchair.

As for souvenirs, there are some discounts on select items and there is a ""buy 2 get 1 free"" promotion on glow-in-the-dark T-shirts and tank tops.

However, I wouldn't recommend having a meal here because the prices are exorbitant for local fare. I recommend eating before venturing down to the Mandai area, or catching an early dinner at KFC (located outside the zoo) because they close around 7.30pm and tend to run out of Zingers and mash potatoes pretty fast."
,,Better than the zoo,3.0,,"Waking up from the disappointment of the zoo, you end up doing the night safari. Nice experience especially since you see so many animals up close. I wonder how they make them stand in one spot. The wait for the tram ride can get really tiresome. We took nearly 2 hours to start the ride and you can imagine how difficult it could have been. But being one of the most popular things to do in Singapore this can get busy."
,,Lots of animals to see in an interesting setting.,4.0,,"Enjoyable evening spent here. Make sure you go to the creatures of the night show. They happen at 19:30,20:30 and 21:30 so aim to be there 10-15 mins before it starts for the best seats.

If you have time, do the whole thing. We took the tram all the way round and then did all the walking afterwards. All the routes link up and you can start from where the tram ends. This means you get to see animals you would otherwise miss and from closer up in many cases.

Don't miss the otters. They are very cute, when we went they had just had babies."
,,Lots of new animals!,4.0,,We hadn't seen a lot of the animals in this zoo before as we had never been to a night zoo. It was great to see the fishing cats hunting and the other animals relaxing away from the heat of the day. The tram car portion was the first thing we did and I'm glad because the wait time exceeded two hours even when we left at 9.30pm. The layout means that you need to do this to really see all of the animals so you should definitely lock that in early in your visit.
,,"Another Zoo, though at night but nothing special",2.0,,"Went with family quite exited as I had heard a lot about it. Plan on a weekday as the weekends are really crowded. The attraction opens in the evening. The fire show at the entrance is nice. There is an animal show which was good but more so as the host were great.
The main part is the safari ride, or the tram ride. It is pretty short for the cost you pay for Night Safari. Also most animals are at a distance and hence at night the it is not great. Also surprisingly most of the animals were almost stationary as if trained or tied up or really lazy.
The food inside is very expensive.
Overall an average experience. Anyone with any sort of night vision problem might want to skip visiting this place and spend time somewhere else in Singapore."
,,Highly recommended if you never experience something like it,4.0,,My first time so I was not sure what to expect but pleasantly surprised by how well-thought the trail was. The tour guide was good and also the animals did show up! It was a little strange at how close they seemed to be when its dark. Lovely and fun experience. Try to do it off-season to avoid the crowds.
,,An Awesome Activity with Kids under 15.,4.0,,"Arrived at the gates around 9pm and already there was a long queue for tickets. But the wait wasn't long as the queue moved rather efficiently. Purchased a combo ticket of Zoo (with tram) and River Safari with the Amazon ride.

Went on the River Safari first. It's just amazing. We have not been to a place that is so dedicated in educating us about the rivers of the world and what lives in it. There's Ganges River, Mekong River, Yangtze River among others. We learned about the different species that live in those rivers and how and why they are different. The kids were so excited to learn all these new stuff that you can see their faces beaming with excitement.

Then we headed off to see the Pandas. Nothing interesting to see apart from the Panda's sleeping and some people who happen to not understand what it mean's to ""Be Quiet""!

And it's off to the Amazon ride. It was very interesting, with the Jaguar, hyenas and ostrich and various monkeys to see. We were so close to them, although I am pretty pleased that there's a glass between us with those jaguars and hyena (never knew that jaguars are that huge!)

After the ride we went to the Amazon. There we learned that the Amazon has two distinct seasons, the dry and the wet seasons. During the wet season, the rain can flood up the Amazon up to 10 meters...and guess what? The two storey building was marked with meter-markings to show us what exactly 10 meters is. When we went to the 2nd storey, we discovered that the building was just 8-meter high, so when Amazon floods, the water would be much higher that the building itself!

We saw the amazing fish and the super huge manatees in the amazon aquarium and we learned how the animals were carefully transported to the aquarium.

It took us about 3 hours to cover River Safari on foot. And we were so tired. So we headed off to the Zoo. And because our feet were so tired, we took the tram to go around the Zoo, not once but twice, so we can have our feet rested. And then we disembark at the 1st station and explored the area on foot. All the animals looked very healthy. And the place is super clean (as what you would expect any place would in Singapore).

We ended the day with the elephant ride. The kids love it so much being so close to the gigantic animal (I even bought an elephant Pandora charm to commemorate that moment).

All in all, it was a fun educational day. I would've given the place a 5-star, but having to coax my daughter after we were turned down to feed the giraffe just because mommy didn't have small change for SGD5, is no fun. The person who was taking care didn't even smiled at the sobbing kid and in turn said ""no exact change for 5 dollars no feeding the giraffe"". I totally felt like slapping him. So that's 1-star less.

There you go, we love this place and we will definitely come here again. But next time, I will make sure I have more SGD5 notes ;)"
,,Try out of season,2.0,,The night Safari opens its doors at 5.PM which lets you into the main guest area to do some shopping or buy food and drinks. The main park attraction area opens at PM. If you intent on doing the Tram Safari be prepared to wait aver an hour to get onto the tram. There where so many people there and it was in an open area with a roof and some fans. Every body was hot and sweaty and not in a good mood. The walk was better than the Tram and you got to see more animals. The Tram did not stop at any of the animals so we didn't get a chance to look around.
,,Nice animals,3.0,,"We took the tram ride at the Night Safari. The animals were great, very interesting ride for both adults and kids.

I found the tram ride to be a bit short though and the number of animals a bit too few. It was the Christmas season so the queue for the tram took a whopping 2 plus hours so I was expecting something longer. You have the option to walk but that would take a lot of your time.

Overall, a good experience but be prepared to wait in a very long queue if going during the holidays."
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,5.0,,"Second visit to the Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo. Excellent visit again for our second visit there. Would go again when in Singapore. Great night-time viewing of animals going about theire activities at night time. Animals appear to be free-roaming without enclosures even though you know some like lions are really enclosed. Got to see many animals such as tapirs, hippos, rhinos, various antelopes, varius sheep and goats, elephants, lions, tigers. Lighting is very low level like moonlight. Animals don't really pay much attention to the tram that takes you through the park. Walking trails and show are also available. There is a separate admissin for the safari which opens at 7 pm."
,,Enjoyable night safari,4.0,,"Great experience watching animals at their natural best at night. The guided tour continues through various sections offering variety of siting. There are enjoyable cultural events that happens at the premises, one can enjoy that and taste some nice food."
,,ok,3.0,,"Couldn't really see much, if you only have 4 days don't bother and see something cultural. More than 4 days maybe go if you like animals in zoos"
,,Enjoyable - lots of animals to see,4.0,,"Great experience doing this night safari. My son said it was the best zoo we have ever been to. It was wonderful to see zoo animals up and about, moving around very close to us. We only did one of the walking trails ( the leopard trail) but saw all of the animals on the trail, sometimes just a few feet from us. Would have stayed for longer but our young, jet lagged children only just lasted through the tram ride, so we had to head back. Highly recommended."
,,Surprising!,4.0,,"(+) There are animals diffenet to the ones you find in occidental zoos. If you have to choose, visit the night safari, similar animals in a very misterious environment.

(-) We have chosen a local holiday to visit it (?). The night safary was terribly crowded! The time for visiting was not enough..:("
,,OK for me,3.0,,"I was expecting more for this safari, we saw the night creature show, but it is too short and not many attractions from the animals, basically most of the animals are get out on the top of the hill and the going back gone. The safari ride also only seeing the animals, no real interactions with the animals, it is different with the night safari at Indonesia, Bogor, when we can feed the animals."
,,Night safari - good choise,4.0,,"We have seen many zoos, so we selected the night safari. It was a public holiday, so the zoo was crowded. We first viewed the animal show. Special thanks to show host, he was a lot of fun. However the show was shorter than expected and maybe less to see. A slight disappointment. Due long ques for tram we then selected the walk through the zoo. It was nicely decorated with lights and candles, but still normal zoo tour . You could not find all the animals in darkness. At last we took the tram tour. Good choise in this order, when que was much shorter, only 20 mins (instead of 1,5 h). Tram tour was nice experience with introductions and easyness, something new compared to normal zoo. All in all night safari was positive experience with teenagers, worth to try."
,,A Fun Mysterious Zoo,4.0,,"Again as lots of our activities in Singapore this was pre planned for us, but I'm happy we did it. I'm fairly certain this is the only one of its kind in the world, and there are a few components to the night zoo. When you enter as your waiting for the ropes to drop, they put on a fun fire dancing show and there's plenty of average gift shops to browse.

When you finally enter, people recommended to see the show first and then do the tram which worked out well. The show is cute but fairly average, where they bring out certain nocturnal animals and show them off to the crowds. If you have kids try and get them to be picked as volunteers as this was a highlight.

Next hop on the tram which is around a 40 minute tour of the zoo - certain animals can only be seen on the tram whereas others can only be seen by walking. The tram guides are worth the trip alone as they interact plenty with the riders.

The zoo really shines however on the walking trails. By now the crowds have really dispersed and you'll feel as if you have the place to yourself. The paths are very dimly lit and really wind you through the jungle as the exhibits reveal themselves. It's pretty interesting seeing the animals being active at night as well. Be sure and take your time with each animal. We also enjoyed the random bats swooping down towards us. Overall a really great unusual experience."
,,Very cool experience,4.0,,"We went New Year's Day and it was really busy. The line to just get in was very long. But it went rather quickly. There was a great show outside the gate so it was nice to be entertained while we waited in line. Due to the long wait in line, we missed the first showing of the creatures of the night. We got in line and waited again for the next show. It's a cute show, but seemed a bit short. Animals don't really do tricks. They just kind of walk out and then back behind stage. I felt they could've made them do a trick or something. But they do give lots of information along with the animals, so it's a good learning experience. We were glad we went to the show, because once we came out the line for the tram was a 15 minute wait as opposed to the 2 hour wait we were told about before we went into the show. There is a stopping point that you can get off the tram, but you will have to wait for another one to come back to pick you up. They say the entire tram ride is 40 minutes but it didn't feel as such. Down side of the tram as opposed to walking: if you miss an animal, you are out of luck. If you are walking you can stop and stare for as long as you want. And if you are on the opposite side where the showcase of the animal is, you may miss out. But we had 2 small kids and we couldn't walk 4 20-minute trails with them. Overall the Night Safari is a great experience. I would recommend it."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"This experience is great for both adults and children. On the day that we went, it appeared that the animals were waiting for us, they were all up and moving around so we really got the feeling that we were on a safari."
,,Good Attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited Singapore in Christmas vacation and visited Night Safari, it was a really unique experience never seen anywhere."
,,Less than my expectation,4.0,,I think the show at the entrance was really good. The animals were a bit hard to see on the tram. I think walking around would have been better.
,,"A long night, but worthwhile",4.0,,"Our family of three generations all found something of interest at the Night Zoo. We had been advised to get to the Zoo for when it opens at 5.30pm, have something to eat, then do the walking Trails, followed by the Creatures of the Night Show and finish with the Night Tram.
Tip: on arrival, Set yourself up at Bongo Burgers cafe, close to the end away from the cafe. At approx. 7pm there will be a blasting fire show, which will keep you entertained until all the gates open at 7.30. We enjoyed the Walking Trails and you get a good close look at animals not normally seen during the day. The Creatures of the Night Show is pretty tame, although the ""recycling"" otters were cute and of course there was the predictable large snake draped around the ""tourist"" (plant in the audience) - the children enjoyed it. We had about a 30 minute wait for the Night Tram - although the line seemed to stretch forever, it actually moves pretty quickly and the ride is worth the wait. Car parking is at the Zoo and just a short walk over the road to the Night Zoo. We booked our tickets online and saved enough for one child to enter free, plus missing the line up to buy tickets."
,,first experience meeting animals in night!,5.0,,"With tram car, we arounded night safari. We could see animals without fence! wonderful! It was amazing to meet animals right in front of us! Tour time was 40 min. But, waiting time was more than 90 min."
,,Night Safari is disappointingly almost the same as SG Zoo,1.0,,"Just like Harry Potter's 7th book which was made into 2 movies, they should not have split Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. You'll see almost the same animals and the experience will also be seemingly the same. What's more, the Night Safari was so overbooked that we failed to watch the shows. What a big disappointment! THERE SHOULD BE A MONEY BACK POLICY IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED."
,,Best attraction on this visit,5.0,,"We visited Night Safari on January 2 2015 and it was well worth it. We loved it. Yes it was busy however we expected that at this time of year. We timed our shows and team ride to later in the evening and had no issues with queues. Go to night safari rather than the zoo, more animals to see. Would highly recommend the trip."
,,"It's quite average, not well managed with crowd",3.0,,"First of all it's quite far from most places. So you need to get a cab to get there, so plan for a long drive. About 25-40 min from Sentosa.

Once we for there they told us it was a 2 hour wait. They said to control crowds they were giving free entry to River Safari. But it was not a safari just walk by yourself.

So we decided to go and wait in the safari line in the night safari itself. We were a big party so we had to bring every one to one spot and then enter the line. Even after we all ate ice cream the line was only about 20 min wait. I don't understand why they had to lie to us that there was a 2 hour wait. If they wanted to control crowds why were they continuing to sell tickets even when it was full. Maybe they can just update their website that the park is full and closed for new entries.

Anyways once we got onto the safari, it was a slow 40 odd minute ride. I would say that it's a good one time experience to see animals in the dark, but nothing to die for.

I found this place highly overrated!"
,,Night Safari - limited animals to see,3.0,,"We visited Night Safari on January 1, 2015 at 8:30 pm. The que was massive for boarding the trams probably due to public holiday. Approx 1 hour through the maze until boarding. They have done a great job at bringing you through the animal areas and in some cases you are very close to the safer type animals. Tour director on tram very informative. Children would enjoy this event. Purchase your tickets on line for up to 20% savings."
,,No Crowd Control. Avoid if you have limited time. ZERO customer service,1.0,,"I have been to the Night Safari 4 times before this visit as I have studied in Singapore during university years. It has been upgraded and expanded to what it is today. The night we visited which was Dec 30 was tremendously packed with a 2 hour waiting time for the tram ride. We lined-up for about 40 minutes outside before we were able to enter which was about 8PM already only to be told that we needed to wait another 2 hours to be able to take the tram ride. We were a party of 8 with 2 senior citizens and 2 young kids. I asked if there was a priority lane for seniors and was told that they do NOT have priority lane and suggest that we take the Walking Trail instead even if it was clear that we were with 2 seniors and better if we rent a wheelchair outside as extra income for the establishment. My next question was why they would SELL tickets even if they knew that they could not accommodate such numbers inside? I demanded to speak with the manager, Emmey and was only told that she/he is busy attending to some other more important concerns. To cut the story short, there was no customer service and no assistance. They DO NOT care and you figure it out yourself. The staff were very rude. Another manager came called Dexter and he adviced us to take the walking trail for 30 minutes and wait for the special pick-up service (1.5hrs waiting time) at the mid-point. At this time, we had no other choice anymore but to do so. Also, Dexter commented that we were “Filipinos” implying that we were not allowed to complain. Unfortunately, we have traveled the world extensively and visited 6 continents as seen on my reviews here on tripadvisor. We know if something is not right and an insititution is badly run…and this Night Safari is definitely mis-managed with no crowd control.

The safari was good. You waste a lot of time waiting for trams and don’t expect any type of assistance here. Go if you have extra time but there are lots of other attractions to consider than this."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"Went in with fairly low expectations after talking to a fellow tourist, but we had a wonderful evening. Got nice and close to some animals.at times they were at a fairly significant distance. Only major issue was the car never stops moving, so photos at night with no flash are impossible."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"Visited late December after hearing about the great reviews and recommendations. Arrived just prior to 7.30pm opening time to find the tram queue already had a wait time of 2.5hours. Queues started at 5.30pm which we hadn't expected (we'd visited Universal Studios the day prior and were at least prepared for queues of that size). With young child this wait time wasn't acceptable so we opted for the walking trail, only a 30min wait. The walking trails were very crowded and difficult to see the main attractions due to the numbers. Perhaps we were just unlucky - apparently 2 large cruise ships in port and it was Xmas/New year peak. We left after about an hour and the entry queues were even longer then. Disappointing as this would be a great experience, and the animals we did see in a night setting were great. Just too many people when we visited."
,,Animals view in night,4.0,,The night time tram journey in the jungle is worth seeing. The information given by the guide was outstanding.The animals stage program was v good. At the end the safari fire work cum dance was excelent.
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"We expected a much closer animal experience. It was very hard to see the animals in the dark. We appreciated it was nocturnal experience but it really isn't worth the money. Not much else to do there. The guide was informative and good, however."
,,Well worth the entrance fee,5.0,,Excellent night out although the que for the tram was a bit long. The night time theme is very well done with excellent information and well presented.
,,Great Experience,4.0,,It is a great experience to kids to view animals at night time. Zoo is manage in proper and good services. Go ealier to having a amazing fire performance show.
,,Waste of money,1.0,,"I have been totally disappointed viewing the night safari tonight. We used RMG Tours and they were terrible, to start with they were 30 mins late to collect us from our hotel which therefore made our whole night behind schedule. The price quoted in the brochure was not correct in fact $6.00 more per person. On a whole don't waste your time using RMG Tours."
,,Fantastic evening don't miss this,5.0,,"The night safari at Singapore zoo was a real highlight of our trip, it far surpassed our expectation, I had flashes of Jurassic Park as our tram headed away from the crowds towards the nocturnal animals. This is a great concept executed extremely well. The animals look like they are in their natural habitat, at times we wondered who was watching who, it's easy to be cynical but this is a really special way of enabling the public to see nocturnal animals in a natural way
Crowds were horrific although we were there around new year
Take an organised tour if for no other reason than you get an express pass so you don't have to wait z90 min or so to get on a tram
Great night a 'must see' if you visit Singapore"
,,Average Experience,3.0,,"Visited the Night Safari on 29th Dec 2014. Arrived at the main entrance at about 6:15pm and there was already a queue forming / snaking from the entrance (i.e. ticket gantry / tram area) till the restaurant area. By 6:30pm there the queue extended to the road side. Amazingly crowded - which could be due to the year end / holiday season.

The good news... despite being in the middle of the snaking queue, we were able to board the 1st Tram. The safari ""opened"" at 7:00pm instead of 7:30pm due to the year end festive period and the 1st tram departed at 7:15pm. I would suggest that sitting at the middle till end carriage of the tram would be ideal because you will get the chance to see the animal ""longer"". The tram moves ""too fast"" and often times zooming past some animals and we were seated on Row 2 of the 1st carriage so very often, the front (i.e. driver, etc.) blocked the view and by the time the guide alert us on the animals (to our left or right) we were already way past the animal. Bad choice of seats - I mean the front.

Overall, I feel it's a bit tad expensive (ticket price) because the animals are quite common. There were plenty of deers or deer-related / family species which can be a tad boring. Personally, the Day Zoo or River Safari represent better value for money. However, if you have not visited a ""night zoo"" then maybe it's OK to visit at least once. Please do not expect a real ""safari"" experience because, personally, it's really a night zoo.

Apart from the 35-40 minute tram ride, the walking trails are also ""mild"" - in the sense that there aren't really animals that would ""wow"" you. Personally, the hyenas are quite OK whereas the tiger and leopard were behind a glass enclosure - so it's pretty much like the zoo (again). Allocate about 1 hour for the total walking trails - which would be sufficient.

The night shows at the Arena is worth catching and probably serve as the closing act to make the night a little more memorable.

Personally, I would not visit the place again anytime soon because I felt it was pretty much the same experience that I had when I first visited the night safari when it debuted in 1994. I was hoping that after 20 years, I would feel different but ""unfortunately"" it was pretty much the same then and now - lacking in ""wow"" factor at all.

In conclusion, if you do not have the entire day / night and excess funds, just visit the Day Zoo and skip the Night Safari. That's my personal opinion :)"
,,Great time with the animals,5.0,,"Came here after a day spent at the Singapore Zoo. Fortunately because it rained few hours before, all animals except the tiger, were able to be seen clearly during the entire tour of the night safari. My suggestion is to do the walking trail first (ask for a map for guidance) then come back to take the trem ride at the end. Perfect!"
,,Best zoo in Asia,5.0,,"The zoo is clean and well kept, animals are ""caged"" in an naturistic environment. The night safari offers a different view of the zoo, and the animals are seems to be reachable. Highly recommended."
,,Waste of money,1.0,,Show was cancelled due to the rain with no refund. unable to see most of the animals as it was very dark with only 1 light.need to walk the whole safari if want to see the animals near.the mc is very detail till can assume there was an animal in the dark. Not recommend and the morning zoo would be 100% better.
,,Lifetime experience,5.0,,"A must visit for every traveller to Singapore and worth a wait after the serpentine queue that leads to the tram. The night life of the jungle is so well depicted with fantastic audio guides that one is bound to become a part of the Jungle at night. It is unbelievable to see the grand African King of the jungle sitting with his family just a stones throw away from the tramway, the mighty elephants shaking their trunks and head, the black bear watching the tram lazily as it meanders its way through the lovely pathway. Gives goosebumps to see the huge rhino or the fighting ferocious mountain dogs or the laughing hyenas. I would definitely re-visit if I revisit the city again."
,,You must come here if you are on holiday in Singapore,4.0,,"Night safari is well one of the best attractions in Singapore, and it lives up to its name. There are many animals in the entire enclosure and the layout of the whole zoo is interesting, and keeps a tourist interested and entertain until they leave the zoo. I recommend going to the Singapore zoo in the morning before going to the night safari at night, to make it a whole day outing trip with the animals."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"This is a unique experience, it excites you from the get -go, with Tribal Dancers dancing with fire-spitting routines, the open tram that takes you on a path , where wild animals seem to freely roam around .. I for once, did feel a little nervous seeing leopards and Lions , may be the night did the trick.. The show with the trained animals is quite enjoyable. overall a time well spent, sure to return with a smile"
,,Great night out with the kids,4.0,,We saw the fire eating/dance action at the entrance at 9pm and we adjourned straight to the creatures of the night show at 930pm. Right after that we just hop on the tram for the tour. It was just amazing. Very relaxing night for us as we unwind after a full day at the zoo. The kids loved it as most of the animals were very close by and we even saw litters of baby otters emerging from the burrows when we took a short walk on the fishing cat trail. Truly a memorable experience.
,,Breakfast with Oran-utans/Night Safari,5.0,,This was amazing the whole family came down and were very entertaining. The breakfast just right. The night Safari was enthralling it was hard to tell if there were barriers.
,,One must go,5.0,,"Singapore Zoo on a night! I loved this place , i salute this country people for their extra ordinary efforts to make it a place worth going. They purchased all animals and make their environment here .... Highly recommended to go ..!"
,,Crowded but cheap,2.0,,"Considering that it's cheap it's ok. It's so so busy. We arrived at opening time and paid a silly $62 for possibly the worst fast food ever, queued with the other thousands of visitors to enter the gates and was advised by a sympathic ticket collector to go to the show first and do the tram ride later. Good advise and the show was fun. Fun in a predictable, every zoo in the world type show kind of way. The staff gave it a good try. Then we queued for the tram. Imagine Singapore in December surrounded by hundreds of people all queuing for the same thing. It took just under a hour to sit in an open bus to drive around and look at a lot of dear type animals, a few bored lions a distressed elephant and a tiger behind plate glass.
It wasn't expensive - even with the cab fares there and back (excluding the fast food) would have been no more than A$120.
Roar and Shore at Australian zoos are better if not far more expensive."
,,Night safari must,5.0,,The most amazing refreshment in Singapore would be the Night safari.. Absolutely treat for kids loving animals. Amazing experience. MUST to visit if you are in Singapore. Most of the animals are from India but the way they have created the zoo is perfect. Superb place must visit. Especially Loved the Girrafe and zebra location.
,,Surprisingly fun!,5.0,,"We weren't quite sure what to do one evening on our visit to Singapore and were recommended to go for the night safari. It turned out to be an outstanding experience! The tours and the shows were really good and even my teenage sons who normally are hard to please, loved it! The restaurants are a little expensive but the food is excellent! If you're going to take a taxi back to town, make sure you take the Regular one (red, blue or yellow cabs). Mercedes and Chrysler taxis will cost you a premium."
,,Get an early night to bed instead,1.0,,"What? You think the fact it's night means we won't see the pathetically small and unkept enclosures or notice the well worn pacing tracks in some animals homes? The zoo smelled terrible, some animals (the few that were actually awake and moving) showed repetitive/obsessive behaviours which isn't good!! Pathetic."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Interesting place to walk around the trails and see the animals. Tram ride goes through different areas so you see more. Long wait to queue for ride especially on hot humid evenings.
,,Three in one Zoo,4.0,,"Because we had other plans we decided to give the main zoo a miss and did the River Safari and Night Safari only, our lost from what I heard. We arrived at 4pm at The River Safari and walked the trail it was fantastic, full of rare and exotic river habitat animals complete with very informative information of each species. Lots of photo apportunities. The freshwater aquarium was Hugh it stood up to 3 metres tall and full of rare and exotic species. Largest catfish from the Mekong as well as other species from the Mississippi, Mekong and Yangtze River. The Panda enclosure was a hit, though I think it was in the wrong place, But great to see nonetheless. The night Safari was also a very popular choice of the crowd it was crowded. The complex had a lot of eateries and shops as well as a jungle fire show. Going on the ride was exhausting waiting on the queue. But worth it. By then it was really dark, no flash photography so no photos. It was amazing to see the wild animals that were spotlighted. The enclosures were big and well done, making them look that the animal can walk freely. The dangerous ones had deep ditch around their enclosure but disguise by plants and shrubs. The entire complex was designed perfectly, lots of eateries, amenities, and show. Easily do a full day here. Taxi cause $18 Singapore. Worth the journey. Will be back to do the main Zoo."
,,Great ride,4.0,,"Amazing to see the animals so active at night, compared to them all sleeping while you enter a normal zoo. Catch the fire display before you enter and take a gram ride. After you are more across of what is where, then walk around."
,,Zoo trip with a difference,5.0,,Not an easy place to get to by public transport but well worth the visit. Take the RED line on the MRT to Ang Mo Kio then take the exit for the Bus Interchange and head for bay B1 where the number 138 bus will take you direct to the zoo. You can use the Ez-link card on the buses just like on the MRT - just tap in & remember to tap out on leaving the bus. Your admission includes a ride around the zoo on the tram which is a good way to get an overview but there are 4 trails you should do on foot. Also remember to visit the Creatures of the Night show which kids will love. Somehow it all seem very magical at night though taking pictures is a bit hit and miss as you are not allowed to use flash. More info at http://www.nightsafari.com.sg/
,,Just an average zoo,3.0,,"It is a night zoo that starts after 1800. The major selling point is to view the animal in their so called natural habitat at night by riding on their tram. But the fact is it is very difficult to see the animals because of the very dim lighting. And because of tram is running, the time to look at each animal is very limit. You can't stop and stay longer for the animal you are interested. In addition, the animals are not really in their natural habitat. Different animals are separated by well concealed barrier that makes it looks like natural habitat. This is also the reason it is only visited at night."
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari,5.0,,"Second visit to the Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo. Excellent visit again for our second visit there. Would go again when in Singapore. Great night-time viewing of animals going about theire activities at night time. Animals appear to be free-roaming without enclosures even though you know some like lions are really enclosed. Got to see many animals such as tapirs, hippos, rhinos, various antelopes, varius sheep and goats, elephants, lions, tigers. Lighting is very low level like moonlight. Animals don't really pay much attention to the tram that takes you through the park. Walking trails and show are also available. There is a separate admissin for the safari which opens at 7 pm."
,,An experience,3.0,,"The Night safari was fun, obviously because it is at night I felt it was more about hearing the animals than seeing them. While we did get to see some animals and it was enjoyable, it was very hard to get any good photos and aside from a fire twirling show there wasn't that much to see. That said, it was enjoyable and good for something different."
,,"Fun, informative and educational",5.0,,"Had an awesome time. It's reasonable priced, well designed, both the walks and tram rides are fun and informative. Some narrators are better than the other though. We can see ourselves going back again. Highly recommend."
,,Enjoy the ride,3.0,,"View of animals in their natural habitat, big Q for the tram which was bit annoying otherwise good with kids."
,,A night well spent,5.0,,"The night safari offers many different experiences. There are 4 main walking trails that offer different encounters from the tram rides. Be sure to go on all. The fishing cat trail offers lots of close encounters with animals as does the leopard trail. The flying squirrel enclosure is exciting as these animals glide above you and there is no barrier between them. The walking trails let you see the striped hyena while the tram rides shows the larger spotted hyena. The giraffe enclosure is so majestic in the moonlight as it's situated next to a lake. The white lion is another great attraction as is the tram ride that takes you through the enclosure where tapirs are free ranging! Really cool. I would suggest having an early dinner at 6pm, then take a tram ride to the first stop. Take the fishing cat trail back to the main station and catch the animal show. After that take the tram again.this time go on the leopard trail then go back to where you dropped off and resume the tram ride. I'd advise going on a weekday and be prepared for about 4 hours of entertainment. There is also a free fire breathing show at the entrance... It is entertaining but if you're there for the animals go see them first. A great experience not to be missed!"
,,Very shocked this is so well liked...,2.0,,My title says it all. This is so not worth your money. The lines were worse than Disneyland. And I'm not even kidding here. It was atrocious. There weren't may cool experiences with the animals and it was just too crowded to enjoy regardless. I'd never go back or recommend to anyone to do so.
,,Well worth a visit to night Safari,5.0,,"We arrived around 8pm and there was a fire show happening. There followed an animal show. We then followed the trails and explored the zoo. It really felt like a jungle trip with the heat, humidity and sounds in the dark. We saw lots of animals. Finally we took the tram tour which was the icing on the cake. Lovely and different experience. Do go if you are in Singapore. We left at midnight."
,,Roaring Night Safari,5.0,,"Yes indeed, from wild to trained animals are great to find in here. Amazing animal live show with real night safari tour steps away from them is amazing. Worthful for me to push myself to experience tthis night adventure."
,,"great animal viewing, shame about the food ...",4.0,,"8/10 for the actual zoo, especially the trails, where you can get really close to lots of unusual animals. The tram trip rushed it a bit if you like to watch animals, not just flash past them.

0/10 for the flashy commercialised entrance to the zoo and especially the food - didn't know one could eat so badly in Singapore - we ended up paying $24.00 for some chips and 3 soft drinks, but the Asian food looked awful and it was hugely expensive"
,,Huge disappointment...,5.0,,"Just returned from one of the top and most popular attractions Singapore has to offer.Great idea (cooler at night in the tropics),friendly and helpful staff,fantastic array of animal life and wonderful atmosphere/entertainment!...so why the title?! Just spent significantly more time in the hands of RMG Tours,getting too and from the venue than actually enjoying all of the previous. The flyer,that probably most hotels are blighted with, promises a 4 hour experience...small print states this will include journey times....however!...with the true journey being 30-35 mins from the city centre,why did we spend 90 mins getting there, a mere 120 minutes...to the minute,on site, then 60 mins to return?!?...the most frustrating aspect was how little you feel you achieve in that 2 hours. The site opens at 7:30 and closes at midnight....so again, why do RMG pick up at 6:30 knowing there's no way you'll be on site by 7:30 and then demand you're on the bus again 2 hrs before closing time? In conclusion,don't take the ""tour""....go by taxi or express public bus from down town (s$6.00 each way,departing every 30 mins) but be there at the front of the public que (well before the RMG customers...despite using the express access...a major marketing point) at 7:30 with your locally purchased ticket and enjoy this excellent attraction to the full!...they definitely don't deserve the disappointment generated for us and majority of our ""tour"" mates....you'll probably like us, only get one opportunity to experience the night safari in Singapore...please don't repeat our experience."
,,Enjoyed this unusual trip,5.0,,I went with a group of friends to the night safari. We were greeted by an interesting fire show! There was a mediocre animal show. Try and get there early as you cannot see much from the back corner of the seating. We then walked the trail in semi darkness. It felt jungle like with the heat and sounds. We were able to see many animals. Not all the areas seemed large enough for the animals but that might have been because it was dark and harder to see some boundaries. Finally we took the tram ride which was absolutely fantastic. We were ther about 4 hours and I really feel it was something a little different. Give it a go if you can
,,Night Zoo is awesome experience,5.0,,The Singapore Night Zoo is a totally new perspective to visit any zoo. You taken in a guided tour of the zoo in trams. A lot of the animals are awake and their habitats are lit up for viewing. At the end you much watch the fire breathing natives as they dance and breath fire to local music. Great show.
,,Zoo by night,3.0,,After visiting the Sentosa island we took a cab from Cable car station to night safari. Reached by 8pm. Our expectations were high as many friends have told that you should never miss this. But it was not as expected. Big line to get the tickets as well as to get the safari bus. As usual very costly compared to Thailand where the experience was better. Animal show is also there for an hour. An average experience.
,,Must for all!,5.0,,Get close with nature and animals. Gives u a real feel of being in jungle. See animals upfront in open and you are in an open train too. You can see all kinds of animals there. You can't take pictures as no flash allowed. Best for family visits and kids. Bit on expensive side. Don't buy tickets from any travel agent. Instead you can buy online. Get government provided buses to safari/zoo at S$ 7 oneway. ComBo tickets for safaris/zoo etc r available with huge discounts.
,,One of the must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Its a gem of a place , the bird show at the beginning of the tour sets the right tone for the rest of the night. Then you have the actual safari..you are taken into those safari buses and given a tour of the park..you can get really close to some of the animanls.. you can also take a tracking tour, not so big though..overall its a enjoyable tour.you also have some good food choice there.
Overall a must see attraction in singapore"
,,Me in jungle,5.0,,Its a must visit place. Extreamly extraordinary concept. you will get a real feel to walk in to the jungle at night. Awesome.
,,NIGHT SAFARI,4.0,,One must try out night safari as attractive .animals you see are different species at one place.In evening it was very pleasant as well.arrangements were good.but you have to wait for some time to climb safari bus.food was very good and reasonably prized.
,,"Only went to be a good sport, ended up loving this experience!",5.0,,"This sounded so touristy, being from San Diego and growing up with the zoo there, I am spoiled for most zoos. This was an exciting and fun time, getting off the tram and walking down the Leopard Trail, we weren't sure if we were going to literally run into a leopard, it was a little scary not knowing what to expect. Luckily the leopard is behind glass, but we got a very close up viewing. Watching the lions being fed was a highlight as was the wallabies hopping all around us. The evening was so unique and enjoyable, I shall remember to always be a good sport!"
,,Fantastic Experience in Night Safari,5.0,,"Had the chance to be there with colleagues in March 2014 for team building. We went to River Safari in the afternoon to see the pandas Kai Kai & Jia Jia before going in Night Safari. The first thing we did there was to have dinner. The stalls near the entrance were delicious and affordable. The staffs are friendly and considerate. We had a pleasant dinner. After that, we watched the fire shows beside. That was really a fantastic show and we all enjoyed that. We took the tram to explore the whole Night Safari. The narrator did a very good job in introducing the animals to us. The driver was steady. We had a comfortable stay. It was a fun, fearless, fabulous night!"
,,quite impressive,3.0,,"The night safari is highly recommended, especially for young kids. the trouble is to get to the place and the journey back after this. the safari itself is quite engaging."
,,Did it move or not?,2.0,,"I spent 20 minutes staring at an animal hoping it would move only to be told it was a rock.
The subdued lighting makes nearly impossible to see anything.
The place is more interested in revealing you of your cash for over-priced drinks and snacks - waste of time! Oh yeh, the whole experience is not cheap. Save your money and go have a nice meal in the air-conditioning!"
,,A really good ride,4.0,,"The night safari ride was really good and we could all see the animals up close. I also liked the way they are protecting the environment. Loved the ""Creatures of the night"" show."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"We went to the safari really late, 11:00pm accompanying overseas relatives on the last day. We hopped to the tram which was readily available. The weather was cool, almost feeling misty in some part. It was very relaxing and enjoyable ride as if we were not in Singapore. We passed through some animals that were crossing the path, and they were quite close to us, that was pretty cool. We stopped for a little bit and had a walk. We could hear the lions were roaring that night, not sure why but that was interesting. Overall, it was a relaxing and unique zoo experience, a must for animal lovers!"
,,A date with Night Safari,3.0,,It is an unique experience to visit Night Safari. I will strongly recommend visitors to take tram to tour thru the entire area which gives you a over-view of the park and a feel of jungle. It is a kind of dark if to walk but you can have better view of the animals. Enjoyed the fire performance at the entrance area as well.
,,Great visit as always,5.0,,"My kids love going to the night safari, especially for the tram ride. Never fail to see different things every time we go as sometimes it could be hard to spot the animals. Gets a bit too hot so best to come prepared (light clothing, mosquitoe repellent, water and fan). The shows are great too. Do try to catch them!"
,,Something to do,4.0,,"A friend suggested the Singapore Zoo, and she is not a zoo person so we thought it must be really good. We purchased tickets at the airport which gave us a bit of a discount - we did find that the pricing at the zoo wasn't that much more. Wished we had purchased at the zoo instead and would have saved ourselves much more by deleting the Night Safari. We came a bit late and has limited time to rush through.

Line up was very long for the Night Safari - would have left if not for the fact tickets were paid for.

The zoo is good for families with time to mosey about."
,,"If you've been to the zoo, skip it.",3.0,,"We are a family of 5: kids ages 8, 7, and 6. We visited the zoo on a Friday in November, and had a wonderful experience. It wasn't very crowded, and the animal exhibits were top notch. So we had high hopes for the Night Safari the next night. We were very disappointed.

Actually, our favorite part of the entire night was the entrance of the park before it opened. The performances were good, the kids loved the outrageous costumes, and we saw a giant flying squirrel fly in, which blew us away! But once the doors opened and everyone rushed in, that's where our good experience ended. We chose to see the show first since the lines to the trams were completely and utterly full. The show was entertaining, but even my kids walked out saying, ""It's over already? That was quick."" Basically, we waited for the show longer than the show lasted. The tram lines filled up again immediately after the show, so we stood in a long line of touring business men and other tour groups to finally get on a tram. Our kids were so sick of waiting in lines by the time we got on the tram, we decided to not get off at the various stops to avoid the lines to get back on the trams. The exhibits we drove by did not impress us, since we had seen much better and closer exhibits the day before at the zoo. The two most impressive things we saw were a lion walking around (seems they're always laying down in zoos), and a giraffe sleeping. Seriously not worth it. The kids couldn't wait to leave by the time we got back to the main area.

If you want to visit the Night Safari, I would recommend seeing it first--before you visit the zoo. Also, maybe if you visit on a week night, the lines would be more tolerable. Or, if you want to follow my advice, I would do the fabulous Singapore Zoo for an entire day, then pop over to the entrance of the Night Safari Park for dinner before you head home. That way you catch the performances and the giant flying squirrel without having to pay entrance fees to the park, and you'll save yourself a night of waiting in lines."
,,Worth a visit with childrens,4.0,,"This is an unique experience where you are taken thru a guided safari on a tram thru the entire area which gives you a feel of jungle. It's like a zoo but with difference experience, where you can see various animals from across various terrains of the world. I had visited along with my daughter and wife. Both of them enjoyed it very much. Also we had watched the anmial show which was very entertaining and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,NIght Safari something you shouldnt miss,5.0,,"I did this a few years back with my kids and wife. it was an interesting venue we had some munchies to start as the tour started around 7pm and was almost and hour and a half ride on a small train traveling at around 5k. the place was gorgeously prepared, all the exotic animals come out at night ang are very relaxed in their surrounding. the lighting was perfect giving it a most natural habitat. the animals didn't look stressed at all and looked like they get a lot of care from the animal loving staff. A must see, a most impressive tour. Good bang for the buck, lots of nice souvenirs too"
,,A Must See in Singapore,5.0,,This is one attraction you do not want to miss. It is truly amazing to be able to see animals in their nocturnal environment and to be so close to them. The animal show is entertaining and lots of fun. I had no plans to visit this attraction and was talked into it. So very glad I went and I recommend it to all the people going to Singapore.
,,Night Safari in Singapore Attracts People from all over,5.0,,"The idea of a night safari in Singapore might make you shake your head in doubt however it is well worth it. There are 2 shows you must see near the entrance before going on the night safari. The fire show with two local men on stage and the animal show. In the animal show, you see animals perform tricks and the facilitator entertains the audience which you will find people from so many countries represented in the audience. On the safari you are able to see animals up close and ride through the very clean and serene park. I do not recommend eating here however. The food is over priced and horrible tasting."
,,Night Safari with Dinner,5.0,,"This was an exceptional priced tour pick up & drop off from Hotel. Dinner Buffet amazing, choice of tasty food nothing like a cheap buffet so much choice. The night safari amazing lots of money & thought into developing appropriate moonlight lightning . All animals seen, relaxed going about their business no sign of stress .No flash camera's allowed all asked to speak quietly animals were the priority not just the visitors ,excellent . Lots of hop on & off walks from the tram . This was an amazing experience , an example of how all zoos should be developed ."
,,Nice nocturnal experience,4.0,,"The night safari was great, we were able to get really close to the animals. Definitely a different experience to see them at night, especially since a lot of them come out for their dinner at that time. It is is quite fascinating and eerie to be in the ""jungle"" at night with those animals around. The shows are ok - fire dancers were cool, but the animal show was nothing to be excited about, you can definitely skip that. Note: we went on a weeknight (Thursday) and it was not crowded at all. I see some people complain about the amount of people, but this is Singapore, the attractions are packed on weekends!"
,,A truly unique experience,5.0,,"We were quite excited about this concept as its a one of chance to see nocturnal animals up close and personal. After waiting in a long queue we finally got onto our tram that was going to take us round part of the way. It was obviously dark and we were informed that no flash photography was to be used and to be as quiet as we could. As always there are ignorant people who cant stop talking or using flash photography which can spoil it for people. There was a problem ahead so we were delayed in leaving and weren't given information but before we knew it we were on our way.

It was truly amazing to see wild animals right in front of u moving about with little barriers and they didn't seem perturbed by the audience fascinated with them. Obviously the big cats etc were well barricaded in but they were awake and could see them. Was hard to take pics without flashes but the animals well being has to come first.

It felt like being on safari in Africa and seeing these animals so close though when doing the walking part it was a little daunting knowing that some animals could move out in front of you.

After coming back to the tram terminus we started the walking part. there is quite a bit of walking involved and some uphill walking. Someone ran past my feet and was bit strange and a wallaby hopped past us but i found that amazing that the animals are right in front of us. Loved watching the big cats watching the hyenas and vice versa. Just like they would do on the savannah.

I was totally fascinated with the fishing cat that sat and watched the fish and waited for them to come close enough so the cat could grab the fish but the fish were too clever.

It was a most enjoyable experience and a 1st and think more places should do this but that's what makes this nite safari unique.

There are keepers at the road where the tram goes to keep you safe and to show you were to go as it can be very dark in places."
,,Simply a must visit in Singapore,5.0,,It was challenging visiting at night with a 3 yr old but we went anyway. The animal show (good host) and fire dance were brilliant and our 3yr old thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of people waiting for the ride but everyone was waiting in an orderly manner. The park was so clean and bug free (dunno how they did it). Highly recommended!
,,A great experience,5.0,,"We visited the Night Safari on an organised trip. It is quite a distance from the centre, and organised trips also have a fixed time to travel on the trains around the zoo. The animals were easy to see in the artificial moonlight and you could get up quite close to many. There are several walking trails to follow and these easily take up an hour. It is very busy at opening time but if you go later you will have plenty of room and can take the train ride as many times as you like. We were lucky to see the leopards being fed, the tiger and close ups of many animals which in a normal zoo would be far away."
,,Surprisingly amazing!!,5.0,,"It was after a fun yet tiring day that we were awaiting for the night safari tour. it was amazing to check out animals passing by the trams in the dark. it is advised to cover the zoo, river safari and night safari together. Climate is enjoyable in the night and its also possible to go by walking trails.
It was only the people who were annoying by not switching off their flash lights even after repeated warnings. A must check out at Singapore!! Also check out the thumbuakar performance and the different shows offered."
,,So Fun Safari,4.0,,"Night safari is a great way to see the animals up close and personal. Take the train thru the park. It's much more relaxing and the air is cooler in the evening. Young kids will love this! If you have the time for a full day try doing the package deal where you get passes for the zoo during the day and the Night Safari. It's cheaper when you book them together.
The only bad thing I can say about the safari is that some areas are much darker than expected and it made it a little hard to see some animals. Other than that this is definitely one of those things to put on your ""must do list"" if you're in Singapore!"
,,Surprisingly fun,5.0,,"I went with another couple by taking a taxi. It is quite far out of the city proper. We went right at 7 PM when it opens . I would recommend going later as it was packed. It took about 30 minutes to get to the trams. It was actually fun on the trams . Quite different at night. You feel that the animals aren't in a confined space. After the tram ride, we walked the trails which I would highly recommend. It was humid and we sweated buckets so bring water . We were worried if we could get a taxi back but they have buses that take people back to your hotels or close to it . It was very reasonable so it was a good move as we didn't see any taxis."
,,"Great concept, ruined for us.",4.0,,"This is a great concept of seeing animal on an after dark safari. We were taken around the zoo on a ""tram"" which consisted of a series of linked carts pulled by a tractor. We were all told to remain seated, to not use flash photography and to be quiet so as not to alarm the animals. We were in cart 3 and the people behind us talked throughout the entire 40 minutes. Even after being asked to be quiet they continued to talk. The people in front stood up to get better photographs and used the flash on their cameras to ensure a better picture. The entire experience was ruined by other people's selfishness. We complained as soon as we left the ride, but by then it was too late. We were so annoyed that we left the park immediately. Great experienced ruined."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Did the night safari (with dinner) and was a little disappointed. This was an organised tour with an external tour company so disappointment is more with them than the zoo, however; the 45 minute tram ride around the zoo took about 25 minutes and the nocturnal animals seemed to have the night off as some were not easy to see (can't blame the zoo for that either). The creatures of the night show was entertaining. If you are going to do the Night Safari, go on your own and probably not part of an organised tour as they are on a time schedule that won't allow you to explore all that the zoo has to offer."
,,A little dissapointing,3.0,,"Took a guided tour of the Night safari and unfortunately it felt rushed. plenty of animals to see, but if you take the tram ride it doesn't stop to allow photos, which makes it difficult with night shots. Over all a must do while in Singapore"
,,The evening safari was fascinating,4.0,,"We went on an organised tour, collected from the Jen hotel and into the zoo. Our guide was interesting on the half hour journey. On arrival he took us for a short walk through part of the slightly lit grounds. We then boarded a mini tram/train and were taken around a large area of the zoo. It was well managed with no feeling of cages at all. This was followed by a fire eating type show and an interesting show entitled 'creatures of the night'
There was a strong message throughout that reduce, reuse, recycle and replant should be the way forward well worth an evening."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"We attended the night safari at the Singapore zoo area during our stay in Singapore. We took a trip with one of the tourist busses. We had a guide on the trip, but once we were inside we had to explore the place on our own. There was a tram tour and we could also walk along paths to see the animals on our own. There was plenty of transport to and from this area which also includes the River Safari and the Singapore Zoo. Taking a tour buss put some restraint on the time and we would have been there longer if we did not have to get back to the buss on time. If we go there again I would prefer to use public transport or taxi and spend the whole day on the different attractions. There are plenty of restaurants too."
,,Night Zoo is the Best,5.0,,"We went to the Singapore Zoo at night, where they have an attraction called ""Night Safari.

The Night Zoo is based on the premise that the most interesting wild animals are really most active at night. During the day they prefer to sleep.

The program begins with an interesting live show featuring relatively small, trained animals like snakes and otters. This may sound boring, but, surprisingly, is not. This is followed by a tram ride through the zoo where various much larger, and definitely dangerous animals are quite active, and noisy.

Do not miss this.
If you have kids with you DEFINITELY do not miss this."
,,not to be missed,5.0,,this is such a great experience I go every time I am in Singapore overnight. It improves every time I go and the meals there are really good.
,,Skip it,1.0,,"If you're not accompanied by small kids, you must strike it out of your holiday schedule. You can do other attractions in the same money and time as the night safari is not only expensive but also far away and awfully crowded for a 15 min experience which at best can be enjoyed by kindergarten and small kids."
,,Unique,4.0,,Unique concept..the ram ride is good & one gets to see the animals quite close. Flash photography is not allowed..It is well maintained & has eating joints too. The ride is followed by an animal show & fire dance. Animal show is interesting specially the anchor is fabulous..connects with the crowd quite well. The fire show is nyc visually..One can also walk down the trails as well.
,,"""Raat ka Chakma""",4.0,,"Night Safari in Singapore is a very unique and amazing experience. It is full ""Paisa wasul"". The Fire show was really superb."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Singapore is a very hot and humid place, so as an alternative to going to the zoo, we decided to go here instead. It was really fun looking at animals at night. The shows were awesome. You can go on a tram that circles around the park, and also into areas you cannot walk. This is where you get to see, for example, elephants. It's a bit out of the way, and I would catch a taxi to get there. This was my highlight in Singapore and I highly recommend."
,,NIGHT SAFARI,5.0,,"This is a must for animal lovers. It is a completely different perspective to seeing wild animals during the day. There appears to be no barriers, fences etc. between you and lions, rhinos,hippos etc.except for the tigers. You have to see it to believe it. Paul and Lorraine, Sydney Australia"
,,"Ok visit, wonder about the animals",3.0,,"Joint ticket with the river safari bought online. Entered the park quickly and got straight on the first tram with no issues. The tram tour was ok but we wondered if the only reason we had a good view was because the enclosures aren't too big. No chance of any photos, one lady used a flash and they stopped the tram to enforce the rule. Walking around afterwards was good, take mosquito repellant though!! Saw the leopards up close and one of them was sleeping against the glass. We would definitely recommend doing both the walking and the tram. Overall we had a good experience."
,,zoo safari concept,4.0,,"Night safari is very well maintained and natural forest like looking habitat for various animals
Theres a safari tour on a jeep and four or five walking tours along with fire show and animal live show for entertainment. the souvenier shops are nice but pass the restaurants .
Very good experience"
,,Fantastic and unique,5.0,,"I had a fantastic time at the Night Safari. The animals were interesting and active, and it was really fun to ride the tram (only time I've ever done that in a zoo/safari, feels like you're in Jurassic Park). Walking next to wallabies and standing less than arms' length from a bat was brilliant. The fishing cat was really fun to watch.

Reading the previous reviews, I suspect the quality of experience is seasonal: I was there in early November, and went on a day when it rained (although it didn't rain that night at the Safari). There was barely anyone else there, although you can tell from the size of the queue organisers that it must get extremely busy at times.

I arrived shortly after opening, avoided the shows (assuming others wouldn't and I'd have the park to myself - this seemed to work), and spent hours walking all the trails. The money is almost worth it just to walk through the jungle at night."
,,Best zoo experience ever...I mean ever!,5.0,,"3 adults, 1 child on a zoo adventure that felt like something out of Jurassic Park...Brilliant! Cannot recommend this highly enough. Most times i've ever been to a zoo I'm disappointed as the animals are usually lacklustre, hidden, looking a bit mangy or going stir crazy! None of that here. Animals all really animated, you get a good view of them as you drive slowly past. All of us were really into it.

To top it off, a massive storm came in directly overhead with some of the loudest thunder we have ever experienced where the whole tram screamed!

To get the most out of the trip, please do get off and do the walking trails (95% of people don't). You get to go right up to, and through, many of the enclosures so you can almost touch the animals. There are also zoo keepers stationed around the zones telling you about the animals, letting you handle skulls/bones etc and making the experience so much more informative.

Can vouch that 5 year old up to 45 year old had a great evening."
,,First & only night Safari,5.0,,Every thing was enjoyable except that you have to queue up for the entry. The fire dance at the entrance is mind blowing. You feel like dancing the dancers are very energetic. The tram rid is very good any the trip guide over the mike is very active and indicates you as soon as she locates any animal. A Very good experience. MUST VISIT
,,Especially recommend the Night Safari,5.0,,"Enjoyed the zoo, well laid out, var,iOS ticket combinations available, your SIA boarding pass (if you flew with them), gets a reduction on the standard ticket price but not the combination tickets"
,,A Safari like nothing in Africa,5.0,,"I have been to close to a dozen safaris in Africa with many night drives where possible. They were great. This ""Night Safari"" is like a dozen of those night drives crammed into one. Obviously the ""sightings"" are all in their coumpounds but their activity is so natural that it turns one off day zoos where all you see is predators on their tummies and prey in the shade.
This is a place I take any visitor to Singapore for an unforgetable experience."
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"I loved the visit from the beginning til the end. We had actually booked the tickets through an agent in China town (you can get good discounts) and queued directly at the entrance of the park. Once it opened, we queued for the tram and did the whole tour. After that we walked along all the trails available and could see many things that are not visible from the tram. There is only one animal that we could not see, the hippopotamus but all the others were out. It was quite fun to spend time searching for the small ones. It is really an amazing experience to see animals at night, it is a real change from traditional zoos. Explanations were ok. It was raining a bit so the show was cancelled, but the rain gave a great ambiance for the walk in the park. I really loved it! I definitely recommend it for everybody! This is my best souvenir of Singapore!"
,,Didn't quite live up to the recimmendations,4.0,,"The safari had been recommended by several people so on my last evening, I arranged a trip through the hotel. It was very easy in that I was picked up and returned to my hotel.

Once we got to the park, we were hustled on a walk on one of the trails, and at each location, we barely had a chance to see the animal being pointed out before we were taken to the next location.

Next we were taken in the tram to go past the animal. One good thing about being with a tour was that our wait for a tram was only a few minutes long. We were fairly fortunate at being able to see the majority of the animals. It would have been nice to have a few moments at each area to take photos, but that didn't happen. The few times the tram stopped, it was due to people on the trails crossing the tram path or just tram congestion.

There was also a fire show and an animal exhibition that were included in the ticket price.

Overall it was a nice way to spend my last evening, but based on the recommendations, I was expecting it to be much more grand of an exhibit."
,,Too touristy,2.0,,This attraction may appeal to kids but I just felt like I was being herded around like one of the many deer we saw. The commentary on the tram was cheesy and scripted including any jokes and you forget getting a photo of any animals due to their no flash policy. This is fair enough as I think the animals are suffering enough. They look like they've been forced to stand around on a small area of their enclosure so we can have the pleasure of driving past them on the tram.
,,"Great, even for a local!",5.0,,"Even though I am a local, this place is fantastic cause you get to see the animals displaying their nocturnal behaviours and you get to explore them away from the heat of the sun!

Must go.. Especially when they have special themes during Christmas and Halloween!"
,,Go for your kid!,3.0,,Nothing much but a different experience. Go for it for your little one's. Do not go on a weekend as you will have to wait for an hour to get in to the tram.
,,3rd time here and how much it has changed,2.0,,"I've been to the Night Safari 3 times now. And on this third time I noticed how much the tram ride has changed. By that I mean the lack of animals you can see. There was no variety of animals to be seen and all we saw were mostly mountain goats... over and over again.
I'm so surprised how drastically the night safari changed!"
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"Well worth the visit-visited the zoo with two teenage boys & even they loved it. Lots of people there, it's very crowded but worth the wait in the queues to board safari cars. You see lots of animals, very cool place."
,,Weather matters,3.0,,"Don't make the mistake of doing the zoo in the daytime and then staying for the safari. There's a 90 minute gap between when the zoo closes and the night safari opens. You will queue for a long time to get in then queue again for the tram.
There was light rain the night I did this so the fire show was cancelled and walking around wasn't a real option.
The tram guide recited uninspired memorised spiels about each animal. And even after twenty requests to turn off flash on cameras so as not to startle the animals people still used flash.
Even with flash the animals are not really visible. Any photos will be ridiculous unless you have special infra red equipment.
That said there were some really impressive animals which you get to be alarmingly close to. The African elephant, the lions and just so many kinds of deer (that bit not quite so impressive).
Don't go if it's raining.
Don't go early.
Don't go after you've already done the zoo all day.
I was alone and an adult and i wanted to cry with frustration from queuing. It would be torture for a kid!"
,,Animals up close,5.0,,"Traveling with kids this was definitely on our to-do list and it didn't disappoint. We booked through a tour company which allowed our group to avoid waiting in line for seats on the tram. The tram ride took us through the zoo and very close to the animals. Some were close enough to almost reach out and touch and the tour guide was very good sharing interesting facts about each animal we passed. We all enjoyed it and feel it was money well spent. We ate at the Ulu Ulu Safari restaurant and the Chilli Crab was amazing as was the beef. They had a fire show just outside the restaurant area which we caught the second half of and it was also very entertaining. Our tour group had another hour free time to wander through the zoo before the bus departed but our kids were very tired so we were able to arrange with our tour guide to take a taxi home which was no problems at all. Would definitely recommend going, especially if you have kids."
,,Excellent night safari,4.0,,"Well worth booking if you've the time, very tastefully done and only about 15/20 minutes drive from the city centre."
,,night zoo trip only,4.0,,"Visited the night Zoo trip and was escorted around in a jeep like vehicle. Watched to 'fire' show and walked around the wallaby area before returning. Although the night zoo is okay for children,as adults we felt was an lot of money for not a lot!!"
,,Night Playground,4.0,,"For younger kids, go early (7.30pm opens) so you can still catch some of the animals before total darkness. If the younger ones cannot see anything, they might not enjoy the ""nocturnal"" activities. Kids will be trying their best to spot the animals/creatures in the dark.

Adults and bigger kids should enjoy the walking trails.
The trails allow visitors (urban folks) to experience rainforest up close.

Tram ride (fee applies) is another highlight. At certain sections, animals are free to roam the grounds, and you might just be 30cm from a Malayan Tapir.

Expect to do a lot of walking and bring mosquito patches too.
Lastly, time your visit for the spectacular ""Creatures of the Night"" shows."
,,meh,3.0,,"did the night time zoo safari. average at best. alot of deer type animals. they all look the same to us, yet the had different names? interesting i thought.

Fire show was also average.

would not go again as i have already been.

no replay value."
,,Try the Night Safari - hints below,5.0,,"The zoo has a night safari that starts at 7:30 pm.

We took the MRT to Ang Mo Kio and then the 138 bus to the end of the line.

The night safari gets really busy so here are the hints to get the best out of it.

When you get there decided if you want to see any of the shows and feeding of the big cats (certain nights only).

Skip the tram to begin and instead do the walking bit. Start on the Wallaby trail and follow all the trails until you get back to the start. By this time the tram should be nice and quiet. Jump on the tram and enjoy the sights.

If you go by bus and MRT make sure you check the time of the last MRT to get back.

Also take water as you walk around a lot."
,,Average,3.0,,Didn't live up to expectations from the advertisements. Dark ride through park on a tram.Not able to see many animals. Maybe they were all asleep.Fire dance show was not enjoyable.I worried about the amount of flammable liquid used by the dancers .
,,Night Safari - Time and money wasted,3.0,,"Very expensive and not at all worth the trouble, is what I can write about this place. Most of the animal enclosures were poorly lit, understandably, and most of the animals were in hiding. Long queues for the ridiculously priced Tickets and then for the tram built up our expectations but, only to be dampened by the experience itself.

Every eatery on the premises charges exorbitantly as well. The only good part was the free Fire Dance by some real good performers."
,,Adventure in the Dark,3.0,,It is a unique and refreshing idea to venture inside a zoo after hours. The staff is helpful and the various trails are well marked and simple to follow. The most impressive was the tiger trail. The buggy ride is nice too as they take you through to the areas with commentary. Deers venture very much out till the road. All in all fun!
,,Night Safari Ripoff,2.0,,"This much hyped tourist attraction sadly misses the mark. Far too commercial with shops everywhere selling everything they can with Night Safari painted on it.
The actual tram ride which takes 40 minutes shows any number of Asian deer types and little else. The day time tour is much better and you see many more animals. The entire evening is weather dependent and on this visit was rained off halfway through.
If you must go then travel by public bus to the zoo at a cost of 6 SIn dollars and book either at one of the many discount travel agents in the City or upon arrival. Do not book via your hotel of the package companies who charge almost double.
I would give it miss"
,,Different Experience,3.0,,"Night safari - had made me and my daughter jumping up and down looking forward to the thrilling experience.

However the whole experience turned out to be average. Though organised well by the management and the organised crowd playing is part, the safari itself was disappointing.

One couldn't take any photographs - flash not allowed and too dark outside. Half the time the animals were missing and the rest half of the time it was pretty much you crossing it in the speed of a jog.

Probably a sophisticated camera equipment can help take snaps but then my slr couldn't which means most of the point and shoot devices won't be able to. It would just be a ride you would be taking which also want too enthralling.

Overall ~ probably should have planned for the day zoo taking out more time rather than just the novelty of night safari."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"We went with school ages children and all really enjoyed it. The shows were awesome and it was nice seeing the nocturnal animals. We were slightly put off by the long queues at the start, only to get in and find we needed to queue for the train. We didn't bother and just walked around the park. We were still able to see all the animals and the shows. The bathrooms were really cool and there are nice plants and gardens around. The bus ride back was difficult with the bus driver refusing to stop at earlier stops close to our hotel and spending an hour driving all around the city before dropping us and others off right at the end (not so great with very tired kids). It was still worth going for us."
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"We arrived around 1 hour before dark so we could enjoy a meal before entering the safari. There are a variety of eating places on the site. We enjoyed our meal which was very reasonably priced. The safari was very enjoyable. Do not be put off by the long queue waiting for the train ride as the queue moved quite quickly. We took advantage to get off the train at the stop mid way to have a walk through the rain forest to the Leopard enclosure. Would recommend that to anyone. There are a number of walking trails too. Staff at the venue were very friendly and helpful. Understandably, taking photos with camera flashes of the animals is not allowed."
,,"How to use public transport, and forget the camera!",4.0,,"Well, this is the second time I've visited the Night Safari - the first time I wasn't sure how real everything was, and I'm still not after a second trip.

The first piece of advise is - leave the camera at home. The animals are lit using something close to moonlight - so unless you've a very good camera and a rock-steady tripod (which you're not going to achieve on a moving tram) you stand no chance of a meaningful photo. And do everybody a favour and leave the phone in your pocket - the glow from smartphones is VERY distracting.

Secondly, if you're taking public transport, leave plenty of time. You need the red line (North - South) to Ang Mo Kio. Then it's a short walk (signposted in the station) to the bus interchange to catch bus number 138, which travels between the station and the zoo. You do need the correct change for the fare (or electronic multi-use tickets work as well). The train takes about 20 minutes from Dhoby Ghaut, but the bus takes a further 40 minutes (buses seem to run about every 10 minutes). It's a good service and straightforward to use, but remember the time. Also, the last train home from Ang Mo Kio is a rather early 11.30 (the bus service runs until after midnight).

We arrived about 19.45, and, with hindsight, made the mistake of joining the early long queue for the trams. I think everybody rushes for this (the tram ride takes 40 minutes) so it's probably better to walk one of the walking trails first - by 21.00 the tram queue had disappeared.

So, what about the animals? Well, it's really quite surreal, maybe even weird. The tram meanders slowly round (if you walk a trail there are regular viewing areas and glass windows) with, in many cases, no visible means of keeping the animals where they should be. The weird thing is all the animals seem too perfectly positioned. Some are obviously feeding on strategically-placed food, but others, like the rhino and lions seem just too, well, perfect. Are they real, or incredibaly good animatronics? As I said, after two visits I'm not sure.

But it probably doesn't matter. It's an enjoyable experience, and something very different. It would be nice if people could keep quiet and listen to the guide, would leave their wretched mobile phones in their pockets (in the dark, brightly lit phones really do distract from the whole experience) but that aside it's worth doing.

The fire breathing and eating show at the entrance gate is worth catching as well."
,,Not just another Zoo,4.0,,"Great experience, no cages or bars, made it feel pretty close to a real safari. The shows were great, especially the fire dance"
,,disappointing outing,2.0,,"this attraction disappointed me. they did a good job trying to entertain you; but, you rode around in a tram car, seeing nightlife . Not sure what I expected, but,all the animals were too far away. No flash photography allowed. You could walk around certain trails; but, I was alone,and that sounded silly. Maybe, I would have enjoyed the daytime Singapore zoo, more?? Anyway, a waste of $44.00sd for me...I took the first bus back!"
,,Fun for all!,5.0,,"This was my second visit to the Night Safari & loved it as much as the first, & thankfully my husband thought it was great too. Did the tram ride round the park first, followed by walking the tour paths. It's great to see the animals so close in & different settings, I love the sleeping lions & the prowling leopard. Good choice of food & drinks on offer, great night out for all, including the big kids in all of us!"
,,"Different, atmospheric but not brilliant.",4.0,,"Bit of a queue issue at opening time; just a long tram ride with option of seeing similar on foot. But it is undeniably atmospheric to see wild animals at night. Worth tagging on to end of trip to Zoo next door (pm Zoo, eat, evening Night Safari), but not a highlight."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"I won't lie, I wanted this to be better than it ended up being. That being said, I still highly recommend doing the Night Safari. I live in San Diego and we have a fantastic safari zoo so I found myself constantly comparing this one to San Diego. You do get to see some very cool, mostly Asian animals that you won't see very many other places. The night creatures show they had was very good. There did seem to be a lot of animals not out and if you weren't sitting on the right side of the tram you couldn't see half of the animals that were there. Overall, it was a very neat experience I just wish we could have seen more of the animals."
,,"NOT SO GOOD EXPERIENCE, SEEMS LIKE WASTE OF TIME & MONEY",3.0,,"I visited the night safari around 2008 but at that time there were plenty of animals to show in the singapore night safari but this time i found that lot of animals are missing . beside that they have kept Dogs, buffalos and lot of animals which are very common animals in india and you can see it anywhere in india and no need to go to singapore by paying ticket to see these common animals.
moreover till the time the safari tram ride thye animal show was house full so i can't enjoy the show. and the safari became more crowdy because of indian public.
so i recmond not to waste money and time on singapore night safari its not worth"
,,Beautiful setting....not many animals!,4.0,,"The setting and atmosphere of this place is just like Disneyland which is great, however I don't know if we were unlucky but we probably only saw about half of the animals that were listed as being there!

I did this as a trip with Viator which was good and I paid extra to have dinner there. Definitely worth getting the dinner as it was yummy!"
,,Not a substitute to Zoo,3.0,,"The night safari is promoted with theme to provide visual of animals at night since most all nocturnal. There is not much overlap between zoo and safari, but the creatures of night show must be watched for all the sincere efforts put in by compere. There is hardly any time in tram ride to listen and see to animals at same time."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"As recommended by friends, me and my husband took our daughter aged 9 to experience this Night Safari at Singapore Zoo. It was quite interesting as ypu get to see the real wildlife so near to you but since we had to queue for almost 2hours and squeezed ourselves amongs thousands of visitors, the visit turned to be quite tiring and waste of time. My husband dozed off immediately when we board the tram and my daughter busy complaining of tired, hot and hungry."
,,Amazing Night Out,5.0,,"After a great day at the bird park I was excited to see the Night Zoo and it did not disappoint.

We purchased tickets on line as it was cheaper and it included the tram ride. The tram you can jump on and off at two stations and it a great way to check out the over all lay of the park. You really need to head out on the walking trail to get to see the vast number of animals that are there.

The Bat enclosure was a great experience along with the Lions that where roaring away in the night. Great for anyone of any age! Highly recommend this attraction."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,While staying in Singapore for 3 years we made it a point of taking any visitors to the Night Zoo. It is well run and a great experience. Great seeing the animals in large paddocks and not in small cages. You can travel on the little trains or take the many walks there. Definitely worth a visit.
,,A Very Rare Trip,5.0,,"I am amazed, at night, we can walk around, seeing the animals with only small barriers between animals and humans. Place is very clean and not smelly. Very impressed. A must for visitors to Singapore."
,,Even better than 15 years ago,5.0,,"This is a great experience , it is very busy , but very well run . The train runs constantly , and the animals are in large areas , and not caged , the paddocks are well protected and give excellent viewing , The separate walks that you can take , by getting on and off the train , are well signposted , and give a good insight into the nocturnal world of animals , plenrty of places to eat and drink , so a great place for a whole evening out"
,,Excellent visit,4.0,,"We had a very good experience during this. We liked the animals which were clearly visible. Although the queue was very long. One tip is to see the shows 1st and go for the tram ride later. Also they click your photo when seated in the tram and charge SGD25 for this photo if you want to buy it. I found it very costly for just a pic. They do not even give a proper photo frame.

Overall night safari experience was very good. And definitely worth a visit."
,,ZOOO,5.0,,I will rate five for this zoo as they have night service also for visiting the zoo. In night they have many different activities also. The place has amazing food but bit on the expensive side. But its worth eating the food.
,,One of a kind - but felt more a bit like a theme park than a zoo,3.0,,"As we arrived late, at the entrance we asked if there was any cafe to which the staff said no and better to eat before entering. Had fish and chips at Bongo Burger (a bit pricey) and the image on the board was definitely for illustration purpose only (!!) while watching the Thumbuakar fire show- which was below average. For the Safari fee, expectation was high on the show.
Tram - slightly too fast and too many coaches. Commentary was good but those in the last coach may not see the animals. We took the tram and stopped at the East Lodge Trail (which had a cafe !!), and walked the Leopard Trail and Fishing Cat Trail as some parts of these trails are not covered by going on the tram. Walked back to the East Lodge Tram Stop and continued by tram till the end. Made a mistake of not walking a bit further the Tram Stop to catch the giraffes and zebras up close.No typical wall/fences. Instead, visitors are separated from animals by almost invisible (electric?) wires and a deep trench.
As it was a night zoo, it was wonderful walking the trail. However, didn't get to see much of the animals on the trail.
Overall, my 2 year-old enjoyed it. Great 'night' zoo experience but maybe too pricey."
,,Overrated,2.0,,Went for the night safari and left really disappointed. This place is way overrated not to mention expensive and a pain to get to using public transport. Much better spending your money elsewhere. A couple of the big attraction animals had been removed. If you do go leave plenty of time. Once your take the MRT to AKM it's another 40 mins on the bus to get there. And remember you need to do the same trip going back as well so you need to be leaving around half 10 to make the last MRT into town.
,,great place to see animal at night,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience see to animal at night, the commentary was very very good (too bad people didn't take notice of no camera flashes) and informative, looked like to animals had no fences between you and them. Very worth the wait and entry fee"
,,Bring you go round the world (not exactly),4.0,,"Interesting zoo experience. Not the ordinary zoo experience where you see most animals live in the cage.

We chose to do the tram ride as we were too tired from walking during the day. The thing impressed me the most was we could actually feel the temperature changed as we moved from ""places"" to ""places"". I don't think many people who were on the same tram ride with us noticed the changes. Please do yourself a favour, don't be too busy taking photos of the animals. Check out the details of each set up.

The only down side of taking tram I would say was, the tram was moving a bit too fast to see sleeping animals."
,,Day and Night.,5.0,,Most of us have visited a zoo in our life time but what makes this zoo a little more diverse to the others is not only the large array of animals but the chance to see the nocturnal animals at night.
,,Zootastic,5.0,,Excellent zoo especially for night safari tour. Great food and great scenery as well. All the usual animals one would find. Truly excellent.
,,Its one of a kind - but waste of time!,2.0,,We went there to experience the worlds only Night Safari n what they show is pretty much 20-25 species of deer along with a pair of lions n elephants. The 45min tram ride feels never ending! They've created a great atmosphere n excitement but havent delivered it to the best! Surprised to have an Indian shack like restaurant inside.
,,Great outdoor night walk,5.0,,"It's easy to get to from town but far, about an hour, on underground and bus. It'll take about 3 hours to walk and see all or most of it, including parts of it by the safari train (included in the entry ticket price). Be patient and you'll get so see pretty much every animal in there. Bring a bottle of water!"
,,Overrated in my opinion,3.0,,Chose this over visiting the SG Zoo for the experience since we've been to diff zoos in diff countries. Pays more than the zoo but fell short of my expectations. Animals wete mostly diff kinds of deer species. Highlights were just African lion and the white lions. That's it. Mostly deers. Tram ride was also too fast to see sleeping animals. Not worth it unless you have so much disposable dough to spend.
,,It's a family night,5.0,,Night Safari is a must-see if you are with kids. They sure love the animals. Our tour guide was so good and he made sure we had an enjoyable ride.
,,Unique experience visiting zoo at night,5.0,,"Fire show before entering the park is good.
It is unique experience visiting animals during night time. You can either walk or take ride or both. I suggest to take ride to mid-hill, take walk for while and then back to ride.
The experience is exciting where animals are really close to you without cage."
,,Where the Wild Things Are...UR2,4.0,,"Wonderful opportunity to see jungle animals in their natural habitats from a tram at night. Lions, Tigers, Elephants, etc all take on a special magic when viewed at night. Tour operators are knowledgeable but all follow the same script. After tram, you have the opportunity to walk a variety of trails at night."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Simply superb. Love the way they have created the entire setup. Animals in their habitat during night. Personally I had never seen anything like this earlier. They have created the night like surroundings with artificial lights and one can either walk to take tram to see the animals in this setup.

My daughter loved this and enjoyed a lot. They have a special show named ""creatures of night"" which is a basic introduction about few animals. They organize it with perfection and the time is well spent.

Caution:
Do not go on weekends/holidays. There are long queues for tram, may take up to 45 minutes - 1 hour to get tram

TIP:
Time your entry such that you go and queue up immediately for Creatures of night show. After the show gets over, go and queue up for tram. You will save times, agony of being in long queue.

A must place to visit when you are in Singapore."
,,Crowds and tram delays spoilt our visit,2.0,,"My friends and I arrived and lined up for about 30 minutes to board one of the trams. Unfortunately there must have been a problem as we sat on the tram for about 15 minutes before it departed. The commentary was good however being on an organised tour from the hotel we only had a 2 hour limit so this delay cut short our time seeing what else the park had to offer.

One of my friends had previously done this tour 5 years ago and she said it was great but on this occasion it was disappointing."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"suggest you watch the show by the animals, which is amazing and have surprise!! if you enter the bats room, the bats would fly over your head! exciting!"
,,Night Tour only! Not worth it,2.0,,For the cost - just not worth it. The night tour is hyped up as a must do and it just wasn't worth the time or money. The one cool aspect is walking through a bat enclosure but most of the other animals can't be seen well or at all.
,,decent experience,4.0,,well it may be a unique experience but the only thing i like about night safari is the show of creatures of night...i have this reservation because you are not allowed to use flash while clicking photos and that is bad for me...overall a nice concept...you can walk on a number of trails in the dead of night which the kids seem to enjoy...the small food kiosks outside the park are nice
,,Great night out,5.0,,"We went to see the night zoo as we had never done any. (Zoo quite a few, but never at night).

It was really a nice treat to go around and see so many animals in their ""natural"" environment during the night time.

There are quite a few stations to get off and explore the various ""sites"" and get a feel of what those types of animals do. It also is very convenient to hop on and off the ""little trains"" that bring you around the zoo.

We would definitely go there again."
,,Not bad,4.0,,"My hubby was like a little kid again... Seeing the different animals...very busy place.. Recommend a tour as very organised.. The possibility of getting lost... But staff everywhere to answer questions and give directions... I was expecting more...especially as far as photography was concerned but No flashes an absolute, no, no...."
,,Great experience but make your own way don't go on a tour as far to rushed!,5.0,,"We went here on a tour and it was rush rush rush.... No time for a drink or toilet stop. Very busy, so go early and take your time to see everything but do the team ride first. It was great to see the animals at night. We had to miss some of the shows as had to be back on the coach otherwise they leave without you! It would have been fantastic to spend all evening there and have a meal."
,,Sad Elephants,1.0,,"I only did the 'Night Safari'. Lots of the animals were relaxing in the evening heat, but the elephant had clearly been trained to listen for the tourist tram to pass and then stand and wave their heads from side to side. When I saw this I realised what I had done... not a good feeling."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"Well worth the visit. We had a great little adventure and enjoyed the overall atmosphere too. Expect crowds however as it gets very busy, at least the lines seemed to move pretty quick though."
,,Aikido trip,3.0,,"We were taken to the night safari as an organised trip which we were very glad of as it is very busy and a bit chaotic.
The attractions and shows were good. The night safari lasts around 45 mins going around a loop on a open coach pulled by a tractor. Some of the animals had just been fed before our turn and a bit lethargic but a lot were up and about. We enjoyed it a lot and was worth going."
,,a special evening,3.0,,"it was a special evening, especially because you're in the dark ... still not too special, compared to any zoo ... entrance fee rather high ..."
,,Must do this,5.0,,"This one is not a typical Zoo experience. Animals will be extremely close to you. Take tha ride or explore on your feet. Choice is yours. Dont miss this one, thats for sure."
,,Kids will love this !,5.0,,"The place opens at 7:30 but reach early to enjoy the fire show. Trams will take you through the safari so much needed rest for your legs! Do not miss the Creatures of the night show. Its superb! The anchor Ms. Nabisa did make it simply awesome. Do line up early to get the best seats. For Indian friends try the Ulu Ulu restaurant just at the exit for good Indian food. The place Bongo Burgers totally is skip-able. Horrible food . Ask for combo tickets for entry into the Jurong bird park, night zafari and the Zoo to save on some dollars ."
,,Really enjoyable (unless your agoraphobic),4.0,,"I would highly recommend the Night Safari - there was so much that I liked about this attraction. I thought the tram ride was genius and informative; the Creatures of the Night talk was so clever and entertaining; and the fire show was something truly breathtaking (and a touch frightening given what the man was achieving). A massive down side to this attraction is that the gates open at 1930 only and the crowds are overwhelming! There seems to be no clever system to disperse people and it just seems that all the park wants to do is make the most money that it can - regardless of customer satisfaction. I had spoken to a couple the following evening that were bitterly disappointed as they couldn't enjoy the main attraction (the tram ride) owing to the numbers of people and lack of services. So travelers - big tip: line up early. I would also suggest perhaps making your own way there as we had to cut our night short owing to a tour pick up time (with constant threats of ""don't be late or we'll leave without you""). The park is open til around midnight but tour groups will often be picked up at 2130 which means you're not able to see and do everything. We missed out on all the walking trails for example.
Other than these two main points I raise, I still believe it is a great attraction in Singapore and very much on the 'must do' list."
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,"We chose to do the night safari over going to the zoo as we were of the view that most zoo's are the same and the night safari was something different.

We chose to eat before we got on the tram as everyone rushes to the tram station at the beginning and you end up queuing for a while for a free tram. As part of our meal we got a plastic cup which was to keep and a nice momento.

The tram ride lasts around 45 minutes, winding its way through the different zones, with the guide providing a good commentary about the animals you are seeing and their habitat. The only disappointment was that you aren't allowed to use your flash when taking photos, and because it's dark you don't get very good photos. It may be that I'm not very good at taking photos but it's something to be aware of.

I would advise walking the different trails after the tram ride, I think there are about 4 and it takes between 20-30 minutes to walk each one but they are good to look at other animals and to see the animals close up that you may have missed on the tram ride.

There are a number of gift shops there to pick up some trinkets. We got a cab from our hotel in the city centre which cost about $25 Singapore dollars. This was the easiest way for us as we had a busy morning! Thought the cost of the ticket was fairly good value for money. Would recommend for anyone to visit."
,,A good experience,4.0,,We went to night safari after finishing the zoo as it is next to the zoo along with river safari.Be in the queue by 6.30 as the crowd increases a lot.the tram ride takes around 45 minutes.the commentary is precise and informative.after the tram ride there is a show of around 30 minutes about nocturnal animals which is awesome.and very nicely presented.overall a pleasant experience
,,Lively experience,5.0,,"The night zoo is a not to be missed experience with the animals so close sometimes that they could be touched if you were not warned, and sensible enough to realise, that they are wild animals and might think that fingers are food! The show was very entertaining whilst also educational. The tour was exceptional value for money and especially an enjoyable way to explore when travelling with family."
,,Long queus,4.0,,"This is probably the most popular tourist attraction of Singapore. The queue to enter the area is very, very long, and the queue to board a tram will take away 45 mins. of your time for a tram ride of about 45 mins. Was it worth the tiring wait? It depends on each tourist I guess."
,,Thrilling experience...,4.0,,The singapore zoo is a must visit especially the night safari. It was the halloween night when we had travelled and which is why it was a very good experience though was a little crowded. The entire decoration was done with Halloween way. We took the halloween trail for the night safari and that was totally thrilling . Even in the day its a good visit ..
,,Great experience,5.0,,This is something you should not miss. Excellent experience for every age group. The entire length of the tram ride is ~ 01 hour hence a very young child may get restless. You could also see the fire show which is done at the entrance of the night safari.
,,Really good experience,4.0,,"Really enjoyed our visit here, the night zoo was like nothing we've experienced before! The opening show was a bit slow, but to be fair that was because the animals were not pushed to perform, so not much went according to plan! The actual safari after was well worth the long queue! A real once in a lifetime experience, seeing animals in their natural habitat.

Throughout the visit, it was shown time and again that the animals environment was much more important than your experience, just as it should have been. If anyone wasn't following the rules, they didn't hesitate to put you in your place!

A great night out, one you shouldn't miss!"
,,It looks more enchanting at night!,5.0,,"- I had the pleasure of going through my first Safari experience of the life time and doing so at night time made it even more exciting.
- The place is quiet distant and I opted for bus to reach there from Bugis by changing two buses and that made it a long journey. But still it was worth every bit.
- Thrilling views of live species of all kinds be it tigers, lions, elephants, bisons etc
- The low light at night makes it close to impossible to take pictures as flash is also not allowed. But still the view in the low light of all the species present there is amazing to say the least."
,,Night Safari Rocks!,5.0,,Buy your zoo tickets online and save a few bucks. The Night Safari is as close to the real thing for just pennies.
,,Definitely Worth It,4.0,,This is definitely an interesting experience to share with friends and family. Some of the animals are much more active at night and it can be a lot of fun.
,,Great experince for the kids,5.0,,"This was a unique experince that I don't think you can do anywhere else.

We did this tour 2 years ago with a 4 yr old, 2yr old and infant and just did it again now that they are older. We did only the tram but will try the walking tour the next time we are in singapore.

The crowds can be heavy. We went on a Friday and arrived about 8:30. By the time we made it to the tram lines it was 9pm and the crowds seemed to have thined out.

I recommend going later, after 9pm, on weekends to allow for the major crowds to leave. I think the night Safari is oopen until midnight."
,,"Unique tour, but be prepared to wait",5.0,,This was a very interesting and unique experience to see these animals at night in what seemed like their original surroundings. Queues were very long for the tram ride though and took a lot of waiting. The creatures of the night show was also very nicely done.
,,Worth a vist,5.0,,"We went to the night safari and really loved the attraction. It is well maintained and properly organized with a very supportive staff. There is a huge variety of animals in the zoo with very close encounters with each. The show organized is also good and the tram ride (along with the commentary) is good as well. Exploring various trails in the dark was fun! The fire show was also very nice.
Needed 3+ hours to cover the entire place."
,,Crowded and Disapointing,2.0,,"This was the ONLY downside to our stay in Singapore.. After a bus ride to the park we had to queue up behind hundreds of others waiting to go on the Night Safari, there were probably another few hundred if not more behind us too.. Then we were herded into the rope lines like livestock (this is how we felt) and slowly put onto tram like vehicles. We weren't able to use a flash so cameras can be totally forgotten for this place.. then the animals .. honestly I was starting to think that most were fake( I may be wrong , but this is how I felt..) as they were very limited in movements and seemed to be on a very small stage set up with lights pointed at where they were .. the real animals that were wandering close to the tram vehicles were all animal that we had seen many times before close up in the wild at home. There was a fire show when we finally exited the tram which was pretty good but by then we just wanted to leave.."
,,A unique experience,4.0,,"Didn't know what to expect, but it was a pleasant experience and an enjoyable one.
It was awesome to see the nocturnal creatures going about in their area, the areas allocated for these animals look big and doesn't look like a cage but that doesn't justify taking them away from their natural environment.
Nice comfortable tram to go around, a good walk around. Nice night shows by intelligent little animals."
,,Nice night walk,4.0,,Went to night safari with my wife on the recent trip to Singapore. Nice ambient and trail walk with some nice animal to look at it. Trip is about 2 hours walk.
,,Great experience - but do with a tour,4.0,,"Had some very positive 1st hand accounts from expat friends - but had read some very negative reviews of the night safari.

We decided to book as a reward for our 9 year old daughter who really wanted to do it - & had been very tolerant visiting museums, mosques & other cultural/historical attractions throughout Malaysia on our behalf over the previous 2 weeks.

1st tip - book on a tour via your hotel. It ends up much cheaper than organising a taxi (& paying for it) + admission fees when you get there. Booming the tour saved us about $40. On top of that - being on a tour gave us immediate access to to the night safari shuttle - with no queuing & waiting as noted by other reviewers.

2nd tip - eat before you get there. The entry fees are expensive enough - but eating there - they don't miss you for anything! A small beer with our dinner was S$12, an ice cream for our daughter was S$9!!

The night safari itself is great. You get to see things I a very different 'light' - no pun intended.

To then have a chance to walk through the various trails was also exceptional.

Great for both adults & kids.

Tip 3 - if on a tour, don't stop to eat ( as suggested eat before) - you'll want as much time as possible to explore the trails."
,,Ok.. but not value for money,3.0,,"Tram ride was ok .
Not recommend night safari on weekends as its a bit crowded.. long queue.
Its not value for money.
Fire show is gud.
TIP: For watching just the fire show there's no entry fee. And animals can be seen anywhere( Singapore zoo or some other place). So no need to buy entry ticket."
,,a very unusual trip,4.0,,a very different experience and worth doing but in the humidity and queing for nearly 1 hour we wondered if it was worth it. it is very hot and very very busy. it is worth it though. the fire performances were good but absolutely mad thing for these young men to do!
,,Commercial,4.0,,"Great tram ride and the MC had an amazing way of sharing trivia about each of the animals you see..take a good camera that can capture pictures in the night without flash...as animals dont like flash. The animal show was exciting and had a message of recycle, reuse and reduce. Other attractions are to walk around in the safari...fire dancers..."
,,Don't bother,2.0,,"We just did not think this was worth the long trek out to the zoo. The animals are wonderful, of course, but there aren't that many and they weren't so unique that we haven't seen them before. Almost like a theme park."
,,Great tour,5.0,,Highly recommended! We did not get there until 10:45pm and still had time to get the tram ride. It was quiet and a really good tour around where you get to see the animals up close! We didn't struggle to see any animals so it was perfect. I would recommend getting there a little earlier than we did so you could do a trail also. Very easy to get back to the city that time aswell due to mini buses running
,,A night on the prowl,5.0,,What a great experience! My only problem was I wasn't there long enough. Would rather go on my own steam than take a tour as I wasn't able to take all the trails but managed three. So quiet and exciting to prowl around in the dark and see animals - having an owl alight on a branch close by - wonderful.
,,Fun with Kids,4.0,,"This is the place we really can enjoy with kids. It was special occasion for kids to see animal during the night. The location was bit far from city centre, but there are tour bus from several place such as Singapore flyers."
,,Different Kind of Night Life,3.0,,"It is a Zoo with a different perspective, ie how it looks at night. Best seen with the eyes and memories stored in the nead, cameras are a waste of time. Head for the trails first and once done take the tram Carry some food and water as the meals inside are not worth it."
,,Nocturnal Animals that One Will Likely Never Encounter,5.0,,"Excellent enclosures host animals of the night. Suggest walking the 4 trails first for close up viewing and then hop on the tram for an overview of the larger species. Many animals on display that one would not see in a ""regular"" zoo. Animals were active, especially the slow Loris, fishing cat, bundarung (?), flying squirrels and fruit bats. Very well done!"
,,Leave your camera at home,5.0,,"It's a night safari people, so don't expect to be able to take glossy photos of the wild life. You will be using your inbuilt night vision, and no camera will be able to see more than a dull grey. That is, of course, unless you play ignorant or plain dumb, and shoot with your flash. Sadly, more than a few guests had to be told to turn their flashes off (repeatedly).

So although you can't boast on your Facebook or WeChat pages, with close up photos of wildlife, this is still one of the best attractions I have been to in Asia. It's unique, adventurous, and if you stay around till 11 am or later, it can be very quiet of tourists!

My recommendation, don't rush the gates at 7.30 am when the safari opens. Let the thousands of guests line up for 45 minutes while you take a walk. Come back an hour later, and jump straight onto the safari tour, without waiting in queue."
,,Not much to see,3.0,,We went to night safari with a local tour company. Personally i think it is more appealing to families with children. I went there with my sister so we only went on the train tour. It is do dark that we barely see anything. I would say it is still a must do activity inSingapore only becoz it is pronoted as the hero local tour
,,NIGHT SAFARI WITH DINNER,5.0,,"Oh my gosh, what an amazing experience with our own private tour guide. We were lucky enough to have all the animals on view which our tour guide said he rarely see's. I have always dreamt of going to South Africa for an experience like this. Totally recommend this. We didn't do the Zoo during the day but Im sure it would be equally as magnificent and satisfying."
,,Ok ok! nothing to shout about,3.0,,Too much public on weekends make it little more disappointing to get a tram ride. But still ok you will get a close look at the animals. Average place to visit but if possible avoid weekends.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Reasonable price for taxi to attraction. Meals were typical tourist attractions. Bongo burger a tad bland. Queuing started 1 hour prior to opening. Not necessary as tickets are all prepurchased and only require scanning. Plenty of seating to wait. Majority of people headed for tram ride first. We started with the live show in the amphitheater. From there we did the trail walks. After refreshments at a cafe at end of walk we caught the tram at a nearby stations. Missed very little except the huge crowds. Very enjoyable evening.
,,Great as a nighttime family active with the kids,5.0,,"This is a great tour to take with the kids since its a fun, less strenuous and less heatstroke-inducing visit to the zoo. You just sit in a train with a little walking. Easily accessible by bus. Come a bit early so you can catch the cultural show at the entry of the night safari."
,,Great day out....,5.0,,"If you plan to go here... take the entire day and do all... zoo, river and night safari... only that the kids will be very tired..."
,,Not as Good as it was Earlier,3.0,,"Earlier charm of the Night Safari is not there and it is better skipped if visiting the Zoo & River Safari.
The Fire show is good and the creatures of the night show is good.
crowds are overwhelming during the weekends and holidays and you would repent for having visited the same.
Can visit if required but most of the travel packages include the same."
,,ton of fun,5.0,,"we realy enjoyed this one (after the disppointing Singapore zoo!) try to arrive before 7:30 to see the show, we arrived at 7:30 it was full, however we managed to get the tram (15 mint waiting during a weekday, try to avoid weekends! as I can imagine it getting very busy, then we saw the fire show (kids loves it) lastly was the trails, well we enjoyed it, as were a large group and enjoyed spotting the animals, could be a bit spookey if I was by myself! Over all must see, (miss the day Zoo of you are short on time!)"
,,Same stuff after 3 years,3.0,,"Its been 3 years since i last visited the infamous night safari of Singapore Zoo. Unfortunately, its almost identical display since my last visit. One thing amaze me is the efficient handling of the queue for the tram ride. Although it was a good 30 mins wait, the constant movement makes it bearable. Not sure if i will return within the next few years though.

If this is your first time to Singapore or the night safari, you will definitely enjoy the tram ride and the shows. However, if you are going for a second visit, probably should give this a skip."
,,Interesting but Crowded,3.0,,"Singapore is well known for its Zoo and the Night Safari. It is a pleasant way to see some animals at night from the comfort of a tram ride. We went Saturday night and the queues are very, very long. We had bought tickets online but there seemed little benefit in that. This is a good attraction but working out the best way to avoid long queues is a challenge. Possibly go and watch the show and then do the tram ride will help reduce the long wait in the queue. Price is reasonable. Guide on our tram was embarrassing with child like banter. The big downside is the Zoo is a long way from down town hotels. Still it is worth a visit."
,,"Night tour is great, but you need a full day",5.0,,"This is a wonderful zoo with a night tour on a tram see nocturnal animals. When I went there was a long queue, but it went relatively smoothly and quick. It is a great park to walk around during the day, so plan several hours to late evening"
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"The place was absolutely packed, and we had to wait 2-3 hours for the tram ride, which was disappointing at best. After the tram ride, we took to a few trails through the jungle, there were maybe 2-3 nice spots. The night safari is definitely over hyped. You won't miss much."
,,Too many people,1.0,,"We had to wait an hour to get to the front gate, then another two hours to get on a train to take us around to see the animals. Well, we were freaked out, so we did our own walk around the zoo in the dark and saw a few animals. Terrible waste of money! Don't go on a public holiday !"
,,Surprisingly poor experience,2.0,,"Having visited the night zoo previously about 6 years ago, we were excited to show our kids what we thought was an amazing experience. I'm not sure what has happened since our last visit or if we went on an off night, but it was a terrible experience. The kids hated it - they were so bored, no animals, they were all sleeping or hiding. Thank goodness we took them to the zoo during the day so they actually saw some animals. Poor tram tour guide. Honestly, we couldn't get out of there quick enough."
,,"Avoid 7pm, wait until 9pm to avoid crowds",3.0,,My review is based purely on the time slot we attended. We were advised to arrive a little early. So we arrived around 6pm as we had not done our research on the actual time it opened. From that moment the crowds started. We lined up with everyone else and as soon as they opened the gates we were pushed and shoved. Only to stand in yet another line for the tram. We were advised by staff to leave the tram until last. We saw the live show. Which was quite good and then started to walk around the zoo. There wasn't as many people but a lot using flash photography. There are signs everywhere asking people to turn off their flashes. We got back to the tram station around 930pm and the line had been halved. We still ended up waiting half an hour. After finally getting on a tram. The experience was very well done and my son thoroughly enjoyed it. However in my opinion the negatives of waiting and being pushed and shoved by hundreds of people far outweighed the actual animal experience. My advice would be leave your visit until later in the evening. Arrive around 930pm
,,Long queues. Overall good experience.,4.0,,"We waited for two hours to get into the tram. It becomes really tiring to stand in the queue for that long. In the hindsight, we should have simply walked the park. That would have given us more time to see the animals and the ability to see from close distance.

However, once we started the safari, the experience was great. They have presented the animals very thoughtfully. Half of the animals have been imported from India. Its such a shame that India can't market its vast resources properly and really lags in tourism.

Our safari guide spoke very well. Flash photography is not allowed if you are in the tram. If you want to click pictures, go walk."
,,Night Safari is awesome,5.0,,A great night time option if you can't find time during the day is to go to the Night Safari. The train trolley tour is an excellent way to see lots of the park and then you can explore the walking trails. Even in the pouring rain the animals were still out on display for the big crowd.
,,A memorable experience,5.0,,"We started with the fire eating show (Thumbuakar performance) which was excellent and then we went for the main safari. It being a weekend, there was a 2 hour waiting line for the tram which proved to be a blessing in disguise since we decided to take the Walking Trails which has to be the best part of this zoo. It was an amazing experience walking in the dark in the jungle with not a soul around. We managed to see quite a few animals but it was impossible to take photographs since it was pitch dark. We will definitely come back for this if we make a repeat trip to Singapore."
,,Night in the Man made Jungle,5.0,,"For quick trip, tram ride is the best option. Safari has good collection of animals. Shows in the park are also very good, one must watch."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"This Zoo has to be one of the best in the World, particularly the Night Zoo. Worth the trip out to the location."
,,Much better than day zoo,5.0,,We liked it much more than the day zoo. We were told we lucky it was not that busy maybe because it was a Thursday. Started with the tram ride then the fire act followed by the main show and finished with the tour with the 360 walkthrough all the trails with a stopover at zebra cafe in the middle of the trail. Tip: plan to arrive early 20:15 and allow 2.5 - 3 hours for full experience.
,,nice place,4.0,,"Would recommend to do Night Safari since almost in both animals are same in it, bt night safari is more adventurous...."
,,It's dark and there are animals there somewhere,2.0,,"The next time we go to the Singapore Zoo we will do it in daylight. There were hundreds of people lining up to go on the Night Safari, and it's very well organised and we barely had to wait to get onto a carriage. Which was great.

But once on the carriage going through the zoo it was more like out there in that darkness there are animals. As an example, in the glass enclosure to your right there's a tiger in there (somewhere).

So didn't see much for the high price at night. But the entertainment of the fire dancers was very good though.

Do the Singapore Zoo in daylight, I recommend."
,,Really interesting night zoo,3.0,,You take a tram that takes you through the night zoo and then you can walk on your own. The show is ok but not very special. It's nice but you have to take into account that it's going to be dark and difficult to take pictures.
,,interesting alternative,3.0,,"The fire show and the animals of the night talk were enjoyable. We walked the whole park and it was very different hearing all the night noises and being out "" all alone"" (mostly as everyone else was queuing for the trams!) However saying that the animals are more active at night is a bit of a myth as a lot of the creatures were either asleep, hidden or standing much as they would be during the day. Wait until later and you'll not have to wait for the tram which is a nice way to round the evening off."
,,"Far too busy, 2 hour line up for tram!",3.0,,"This was unfortunately our worst experience in Singapore. Not sure if going on a Friday night made it worse but it was over an hour wait to get in. We therefore missed the first Creatures of the Night Show. The wait for the tram was 2 hours. Just bloody ridiculous and the noise and chaos was enough. We gave up and just ended up walking along the trails. There are plenty of signs to say keep quiet, yet still so many people felt the need to yell and shout. What should have been a pleasant walk around at night looking at animals was just headache inducing. We gave up after 2 hours as our son was fed up and too tired to keep walking. I went to the ticketing area to ask for a refund on the tram tickets $5each and was told too bad, they are non refundable! I was disgusted. It's not the extra $5 so much as we should have been told about the 2 hour wait when we bought them, then we wouldn't have got them.
I couldn't wait to get out of there!
Really disappointed as I've been to the night safari twice before and loved it. Really wanted my son to experience it this time around and it has now put us off ever going again."
,,"Big crowds, little to see",2.0,,"Wish we could say we enjoyed our visit to the Night Safari but we'd rank it lowest of all the activities we found in Singapore. First, it's a long way out of the city, although there are regular shuttle bus services from hotels available for $6 a trip. Got there about 6pm for a 7.30 start intending to have dinner before the tram ride but found the crowds already forming a queue so thought we'd better join up. There were hundreds of people pushing forwards towards the start of the tram ride which was a little uncomfortable to put it mildly. The mob eventually resolved into two queues that snaked around for over an hour before we were able to board a tram. The crowding and the heat weren't pleasant but at least the fire show while we waited was impressive. The tram ride itself wasn't much, driving slowly in artificial moonlight (dim lighting) for about 3/4 of an hour and seeing animals that could be seen better - and photographed, in the daytime. To be fair, the commentary (in English) was good and we saw lions, a tiger, elephants, bison, deer and others but couldn't photograph them in the dark conditions from a moving vehicle. The idea is that after the ride you get onto the various trails and walk around the park to see the animals, but by that time we'd had enough and caught a taxi back to the city for dinner. In hindsight I'd suggest not trying to catch an early ride but wait until later - 8.30 or 9.30 to join the queue. There's lots of food available at the park so have dinner first. Expect the crowds and plan to spend time on the ground after the tram ride. Be sure to have your camera set for night shots with the flash turned off and hopefully you'll enjoy the Night Safari a lot more than we did."
,,New experience,5.0,,This was something totally different from anything I've done before. I took a ride in the tram first then was able to walk around on my own. It is a great idea to see animals active that are usually sleeping when you visit them in a regular zoo during the day. Can't get any good pictures though
,,wonderful visit if u hv kids,4.0,,"dont miss the night safari..much better experience seeing the animals in the night. unfortunately the week we were in singapore was china golden week plus 3 day weekend due to a national holiday in singapore and so the zoo was realy crowded. so we had to explore by foot which is nice coz the line to get on the tram was a 2 hr wait !! however, not to miss the tram ride as it takes you to parts of the zoo that are not accessible on foot."
,,A fun and unusual evening- ruined by other tourists!,3.0,,"I mostly enjoyed this activity- we went on a tram which took us around to see all of the animals and the guide spoke excellent English and explained so much about the animals. We saw a fire show and a live animal show which was really fun! It wasn’t too expensive and there was a shuttle service from the Singapore Flyer and it dropped us back to our hotel after. Pretty good value and it’s something I’ve never done before- really different to the ordinary zoo experience.

The whole experience was somewhat ruined for me, however, by the other tourists!! I lost count of how many times- at least 30!- when a guide had to say “do not take flash photography of our animals”, “please turn your flashes off”, “flashing lights at these nocturnal animals could harm them, please, do not use flash photography”- yet the rude and inconsiderate people on the tour continued to do so. The compare from the live show even said the same phrase in English, Thai, Japanese, Mandarin, Malay, Indian and German! Another issue is that some parents bought very young children with them- the children were up past their bed time, probably bored, and lots of them were crying and being badly behaved. Why bring young children to an evening which lasts beyond 10pm? Finally, it was beyond rude when, during informative talks from the well trained staff, tourists who could perhaps not understand English or just weren’t interested, just talked loudly in their own language over the guides. It was appalling, and meant that most of the time I was struggling to hear about the animals.

To sum up- I wouldn’t go again. I was glad I went but I would STRONGLY advise people to go when it was quieter, maybe out of season or midweek. If you are going to go, please be considerate to the other people around you, and the animals!!"
,,Spoiled only by people with camera flashes...,5.0,,"The River / Night Safari and Zoo are a reasonable distance from the city centre (a taxi or the MRT & bus away), but, it is well worth the trip to see them (They are side by side, and it's possible to do all three in a day if you choose).
We were pleasantly surprised at how well you can see the animals, even in the low light. There are several food places and a gift shop. Take the trails and then the tram. These are some of the same animals you will see at the River Safari, so, it is interesting to see them in their nocturnal habits.
The tram was spoiled by a large number of people who clearly didn't listen to the request for them to turn them camera flashes off, which spooked a few of the animals..."
,,Night Safari Waste Of Time,3.0,,Waste of money & waste of time. Go during the day as it's a much better experience. Getting very commercialised & food & drink a rip off!
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This attraction is something not to be missed! Right next door to the River Safari and Singapore Zoo. Between the tram ride (40 mins) and the Creatures of the Night show, we were entertained the entire time! Plenty of places to eat and lots of shops to explore. The animals are amazing and the commentary on the tram ride is great. Don't leave Singapore without visiting the Night Safari!"
,,Night out with a difference,4.0,,"It is not often one visit a zoo in the evening/night. The Night Safari is one of the better options for a visit if you have limited time visiting Singapore. Better to get a taxi to this spot as the subway/bus connections take up a bit too much time. Locals advised not to get there too early as the place may be quite busy. We got there at 8:30 pm and saw many visitors leaving. Just the perfect timing. No queue to the ticket counter, just a walk-in to the tram service, and a relaxed casual stroll viewing the animals. It takes a while adjusting to the night lights and looking out for the nocturnal animals well camouflaged in the surroundings. The tour was educational bringing new insights to some of these animals. Viewing lions, leopards, giraffes, tapir, zebras in the night offers different insight to their natural activity."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"My wife was initially unsure saying ""it's just another zoo"" and a little pricey, but after going she was super impressed as were the rest of my family for a unique experience. I would strongly recommend going early as we went a little late (~8:30pm) so we did the fire and up-close shows first, then the tram ride, then the trails - just squeezing it all in by midnight. If I had my time again I would have got there approx 6pm, done the trails first as other writers suggest and perhaps even splitting it up since there is a tram stop half way. The tram ride queues are always long, so just deal with it. With the Up Close show, I would suggest seating along the isles so you can see some of the animals as they bring them down, and also you can get out quickly at the end as it is always packed.

The park itself and the setup is amazing with enclosures allowing a very close viewing experience via the tram and trails. A must do if you have not done it before and will not disappoint."
,,More time spent queueing than seeing.,3.0,,"Possibly not the best idea to visit Singapore's Night Safari on 'Children's Day' eve. It was bedlam! We stayed for 3.5 hours of which 2.5 hours was spent queueing, firstly to get in and then to get on the tram. I will give kudos to the staff - they were at all times friendly, helpful and worked extremely hard to keep the massive crowd moving. We saw the Night Creatures show - again, were slightly disappointed, as we were seated to the side and spent much time hearing about what we should have been seeing, but not actually seeing it!! The tram ride and commentary was good - it did feel like you were very close to the animals - highlights were the bat flying past the tram and the inquisitive buffalo that stuck it's head in the tram. I would recommend people visit, just pick your day carefully and expect to wait in queues."
,,Great show but very crowded,5.0,,"The fire breathers at the entrance definitely catch your attention!!! If you can get in and line up straight away for the tram, this is recommended, then see the show after that. It is easier to get into the show than to get on a tram as the lines are ridiculously long. The show is entertaining and lasts for about 30mins. Food is expensive but good quality."
,,Surprise,5.0,,quite surprise that most of the animals can be seen & worth the money. I suggest to walk the trail first & ending with the tram ride so that you can relax & rest after a tiring walk.
,,Good one for first time,4.0,,"A well planned and maintained garden. Many types of plants and trees in the garden, good walking tracks with provision of rest at regular intervals. Do check out the light and sound show in the evening"
,,A waste of a good night in Singapore.,1.0,,"The night safari tour on the tram is an over hyped rip off. Our tour bus left the hotel at 5.30pm. We then proceeded on an hour tour of Singapore's hotels picking up other people.Eventually we arrived at another bus where we transferred to a larger bus. We arrived at the zoo at just after 7.00pm!! Great tour so far. We got out and queued up(thousands of people every where) when we got to the end of the queue, surprise - you are now at the end of a queue from hell,with very poor ventilation.We spent 1 hour in the queue,it was stinking hot and babies and young kids were getting upset, not to mention everybody else. Eventually, the hyped up tram arrives where you are lined up like cattle to the slaughter and hurried onto it for this ""Fantastic Night Safari"".We were squeezed into our seat with a very large couple, hot night, no breeze - you know the rest. According to our tour guide, the Safari would take 40 minutes. It was all over in 30. The Safari tram going way too fast to have a good look,the only time the tram stopped was when it had to, we had caught up with the tram in front.It was an absolute rip off. When it was over,we were then herded into the overcrowded food area- This was ditto of the above and costly as well.Two small dinners, one had to go back as it was served cold, plus two wines $60.00. At the end of the night, 5.30pm to 11.00pm for that - very disappointing and a waste of a valuable night in Singapore.

We did the night zoo WALK at the same zoo 6 years ago and it was excellent, which is why we went back.
Tip - DO NOT DO THE NIGHT SAFARI ON THE TRAM. Walk,the zoo is excellent. As an alternative, go early in the day. Less crowds and you will see more.

Zoo management,Last night 3rd Oct, you should be ashamed of the way you place people in those horrendous queues with very poor air circulation. This sort of treatment is not what visitors to your zoo expect nor deserve!"
,,Excellent time,5.0,,We did an all day trip here and it was time well spent. The night train ride was awesome. All the animals and marine life were very healthy looking. The place is very clean as with all of Singapore. Highly recommended.
,,Outstanding zoo attraction,5.0,,"Quite a drive from city center, but worth out. Well landscaped, great chance to view a variety of animals that are nocturnal. One tip - avoid the tram ride and walk the trails - you see a LOT more animals this way. But, take an umbrella. Rainy season can mean evening showers. Great place!"
,,"Long, hot lines",2.0,,"This seemed like a good concept, but was miserable. Started with an hour and a half worth of lines with little air move my. Then rode a tram in the dark and saw shadows of animals or animals sleeping for the most part. The walking around was better, but too many of the animals were not nocturnal and were not active. The porcupines and bats were neat and saved this from being a rating of 1."
,,"Boaring , waste of time,money and energy !!!",1.0,,"Was there with my wife and daughter of 14 years.It was simply a stupid tour.Nothing much to see,just a hipe and Singaporian marketing skills!! Don't waste your time going there!!!"
,,Biggest queues ever,3.0,,We waited one and a half hours for a 40 minute ride on a tram that took us through the forest . If it hadn't been for the very entertaining tour guide it would have been a wash out. The queue took us into the queue then out then back in in a torturous snake like movement. Don't bring your kids unless you want lots of crying
,,Great night zoo experience,5.0,,I was on a business trip for 4 days in Singapore including one free day. Several colleagues talked to me about the night safari. I did not have my kids but still decided to give it a try. It was a very good experience. First it was a little cooler than during the hot day. Second I had never done a zoo by night. It was great. You can walk for about 45' and see animals very close. I was surprised how many animals we were able to see (I was worried it would be tough to see them). You can also take the free buses for 45' and you see other animals many of them very close as well. Overall very good night. If I have ever go on vacation with my family I would go back!
,,Night zoo,5.0,,"do take the night zoo experience, we found it magical and serene. Take a coach trip there, many companies have tours. Take the early night one as its not so busy."
,,Night Safari a real treat.,5.0,,"Skip the loud performing animal review and get on the tram around the zoo. Lighting is discrete ""augmented moonlight"", route covers areas you can't go yourself on foot, and you see wild animals very close, as though you were indeed on safari. If you do this on the same day as a zoo visit, the food offerings are better on the night safari side, so go straight there once the zoo closes."
,,Kids will enjoy,3.0,,"It is too boring for adults, will only recommend to families with kids. Very long queue. Don't go with any tour package, you will certainly run out of time standing in long lines."
,,Very boring,2.0,,We decided to visit the night safari after reading some good reviews about the place. However this place is super boring and they shouldn't be calling it night safari. It was a very boring tram ride across the park with animals on either side. Most of the animals looks doped and since the ride happens only in the night you can't even see the animals properly. U have to use your imagination to figure out what you are looking at. To add to our misery our cart was filled with a huge tour group who were over talkative so we cudnt hear a word the guide was telling (oh btw even the guides were pretty boring). It's not worth the money we paid for this safari. There are many more interesting and better things to do in Singapore so my advise is don't waste ur time doing this.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"A pleasant evening visit gave us access to the little train (with commentary), several walking trails, a fire show and a short animal performance. We really enjoyed our visit although we were not able to see all of the animals but in this type of zoo it is the luck of the draw. Thoroughly enjoyed our time here."
,,A must if you're a Zoo fan,5.0,,"It was simply an amazing experience to be able to walk in the park, very close to nocturnal animals, on our own. We took the tram ride and then walked all 4 trails in the park. Except for the occasional rude tourist using the flash or lantern (although specifically told not to by the staff) to spot the animals better, it is dark enought for most animals to get very close, so you are in for quite an experience."
,,A fantastic evening,5.0,,"Do the tram ride early otherwise some of the animals will have wandered off for a sleep! The walking trails are easy and you can get up close to some of the more friendly animals. Do the show, lots of fun"
,,Great way to spend an evening in Singapore!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the night safari – arriving by tube and taxi which was a mistake as the shuttle bus back was very handy! Inside there is a train which takes you round and you clearly see the animals, no large fences etc, all very close. Good selection of animals and they looked well cared for. We were a bit late in getting here (c. 9pm) as we thought we’d have dinner first, expecting poor quality inside however the cafes/restaurants all looked good so we wished we hadn’t bothered so we had longer there! That being said, we had two hours and found we seen comfortably all we wanted to see. A good way to spend an evening!"
,,A great night out,5.0,,"We went on an organised tour to the night safari...The tour picked us up from our hotel and drove us home.My only complaint is that we felt a bit rushed and would have liked to stay longer..Next time we will visit on our own so we can stay as long as we want...We had a really great buffet meal at Ulu Ulu...then went on a ride around the grounds on the tram...you are very up close to the animals..
After seeing the animals they had a firebreathing show (ok) and a creatures of the night show(great..the kids and I loved It)...we didn't have time to walk around the grounds which we would have loved to have done as we were on a tour....( bring a torch and mossie cream if you do the walk)"
,,I give it 10 stars!,5.0,,"I had a difficult time deciding between Night Safari and Colors of the Sea. Glad I choose going to the Night Safari. I enjoyed every bit of my time. There was not one animal that I did not go to have a look. Take the trail walk first then save the tram ride for last. It will blow you away. If I live in Singapore, i will go back everyday. Kudos to the people who looks after the zoo and the animals. Great job."
,,Great Night. Shows were a little cheesy for my taste.,4.0,,Great night. Book beforehand or get there early as the queues can get quite long. Overall though great night wandering around. Leave the tour bus round the park to last as the queues at the begining are massive.
,,Tour with my family,4.0,,This is one of the nicest place to visit in Singapore. When me and my family arrived in Singapore on that late afternoon we immediately went to the place. Since the show starts at the evening it was just the right thing to do.
,,Just ok,3.0,,"Most of the animals are just the usual ones. The view are pretty dark so you have to really focus your eyes. The fire show was very interesting but the Creatures of The Night was disappointing, for 30min nothing much special happened."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Had a really good night out at the zoo they fire show was a good way to start off the animal of the night show was ok nothing that great but had some interesting things. The best part was the tram and also being able to walk around and see the animals that would normally be asleep during the day be active, I really enjoyed seeing the tigers and hyenas up close roaming about. We arrived just in time for the later fire show and finished just before closing, riding the tram later in the night is better if busy as we walked right on."
,,A safari without the long travel,5.0,,"Having been on legitimate safaris before, I thought this would be a bit of a disappointment. It is certainly not as wonderful as the real deal, but it's the closest you're going to get without trekking to the middle of nowhere and paying a lot of money.

The fact that the animals roam ""freely"" in designated areas is really, really neat. Totally different from any other zoo I've been to.

The only negative side to this attraction was the second tram ride. We had some obnoxious visitors behind us who did not bide by the rules of being quiet and refraining from flash photography. Such is the price of being a tourist. In all, still an excellent experience and well worth the drive from the city."
,,An adventurous retreat!?,5.0,,"The night safari is an amazing attraction which is suitable for people who love wild lives and want to escape from the humid weather in Singapore. You will like it more if you like hiking. You won't regret you spend 3 hours in the safari after seeing the view and animals.
Remember to spare some time for the transportation!"
,,Night Safaria must see!,5.0,,I'm not that keen on zoos but went to the night safari and it was amazing. I don't know how they do it but it feels like you can almost touch the animals You must do this is you are in Singapore even if it is only for a fleeting visit. Brilliant!!
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"It was indeed a nice experience. It is suppose to be one of the most interesting things to do in Singapore.
Going there, you meet a huge place that has 3 attractions together, zoo, river safari, night safari.
I recommend to take a day full and go there, zoo and river safari in the morning and afternoon, food in one of the many many restaurants and at the end the night safari.
Getting there around 7;30 we saw the really nice dance with fire they do in the begging.
Then we went around the forest with a open van and the guide talking. You can see a lot of animals around, and some of then you'll never see before.
Being around many zoo in my life, I found the park ok, not amazing,
The animals can, may, (possibly wont) come really close to you in parts of the park that the fences are off.
The is also the trails that you can go on your own without the guide around and see many more animals up close. everyone of them has a small sign indicating the name and origin of each animal.
See the lion and tiger feeding in special hours, try and see it.
Overall it was a nice experience."
,,Not upto the expectaion!!,3.0,,"Of all the places we went around in Singapore, the one place that disappointed everyone was the night safari. Not that it was bad, its just that the crowd that day, the wait for the trams, the fight with the queue-jumping idiots made me want to go to the hotel and sleep.

And above all, the endless procession of deers, peccary, buffaloes in the exhibit made me think of the Vandalur with a fondness I've never felt before. Except for the uniqueness of going around in the night, there is nothing worthwhile here. The 'creatures of the night' show was good but that is just trained animals running through the hoop.

Overall, a disappointment when compared to the River Safari which was much more interesting and educative"
,,It's amazing,5.0,,I loved it's amazing and safari night it's really good and the restaurant is so good and u meet many people are going to the Safari in night and u found animals show
,,Enchanting zoo,5.0,,"Being from India which is the home of lions,tigers, elephants and almost all big cities having a zoo, this unique zoo with its unique xihibition of NIGHT SAFARI in which the guided tour through the zoo in a silent car showcasing so many animals in their natural surroundings in the darkness of night without disturbing them is simply amazing and wonderful-- nothing like any other zoo in the world- seeing is believing!! It will give you an unique feeling as if you are roaming in a dense jungle full of wild animals"
,,Wonderful Experience-must do the trails!,5.0,,"Loved the tram ride (beautiful, well paced and great way to see the animals!) but the best part for us were all the trails. We did all three and had an amazing time watching the malayan tiger (he was so close to us!), the leopards, asian lion, otters, hippos and the wallabies amongst many many others. We just loved the whole experience and ended up spending over 4 hours there.

Helpful hints:

Go to the trails first and the tram ride later. After 9:30pm there were very few people in line for the tram!

Same applies for the 'Creature of the night show'- go later if possible to avoid crowds.

Avoid weekends as much as possible- the zoo/night safari is so peaceful during the week (mon- thurs).

We found the food at the ulu ulu restaurant very expensive so we might look at other options for our next visit."
,,Highly recommend the Night Safari!,5.0,,"What an amazing experience! A massive open range zoo with shows, educational tram tour, great transport options (tram and/or walk) and of course a large range of animals. Thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommended!"
,,Great night out,5.0,,"I read previous comments about this venue but went with an open mind. It was really a great night. Lucky for us really the formula one racing was on and the zoo wasn't as bad as previous comments suggest. We waited less than a minute for the informative tram ride. We saw every animal that was talked about and more. The night show was funny and interesting, kids will love it. Animals come out from everywhere. After we had a really nice dinner in one of the many food places. Basic, fresh meals served, just be careful, some are a bit pricey but that's Singapore so have a look around. Overall it was a good night out. Don't know what all the previous whinging was about"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"enjoyed the tram ride and was amazed with the animals, some weren't even in enclosures, like literally you could touch them!!! but please don't as this might harm them and you. no pics though as flash photography is forbidden."
,,Different,4.0,,"It was quite a long queue to get in when we arrived just before it opened. My daughter was about 5 then and she was a bit scared by the fire torches and the warriors at the opening of the safari.

But later she loved the tram ride- we went 3x!- and we could see all the animals at close. We even saw the baby giraffe nestling close to the mum and were very close to the some of the animals.

The show was a bit loud for young children and she wasn't really into that...she thought the day zoo shows were better. It was a bit long and draggy and we decided not to stay for the whole show.

It rained when we were there! and there wasn't much of a shelter but thankfully it was a short shower.

But it was a unique experience- a night zoo but not sure if we will go again."
,,A great experience. Zoo at night,5.0,,"Went to.the night safari enjoyed the shows with the animals spolit by someone using a flash when we told it could scare the animals. And it did Because a,white wolf who was supposed to howl didn't due to the flash photography. Using the tram for several regions was great. We saw all the animals in their environment. It was a brill experience which I have not seen other zoos do so good on you singapore zoo. Good for adults and children alike."
,,Was a good night and a nice experience,4.0,,"we found the night safari to be a better experience than the zoo. We did the show first and then walked the leopard trail and cats and then boarded the train foe the remainder of the journey.

Quite enjoyed the night. You got to be quite close to many of the animals which was great for the kids.

The show was ok without being great so we where glad we went to the first one so we could leave at whatever time we liked and didn't have to wait to see a later show.

To be honest the only bad thing I could say was $13.50 for a can of Tiger beer. That was a complete rip off. The meals in between where reasonably priced but you don't have to mark up your beer 5 fold to make a decent profit.

Would visit again"
,,Nothing spectacular...,3.0,,"The tram ride was nice as you'll ride through the safari feeling the gentle and cooling breeze.

Expected more out of the animal show but it was a huge let-down. No hyenas/wolves on the show as claimed on the brochure.

All in all, it was an average experience. Good to go once but that's about it."
,,adventurous night in the wild!,5.0,,"International standard zoo with the additional bonus of being a night entertainment! Excellent condition and delightful performances, a must try authentic experience!"
,,Excellent and well worth the money,5.0,,Went here with some friends and definitely a must see in Singapore. You take a tram around for 45 mins and you can see the animals up close. There are also trails such as leopard trail which you can explore. Make sure that you have a couple of hours spare to see all of the night safari. Very informative guides for the shows and the tram ride. Don't miss it!
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,"We loved it! Don´t wait for the bus, but go around on your own if you want to have a real experience. Otherwise you going to be stuck in the queue for a bus and then pass pretty fast by the different section of the zoo in the bus, without properly seeing anything. Night Zoo is very popular, therefore it is pretty crowded, but absolutely worth a visit!"
,,Nothing much,3.0,,"My family and I went to night safari singapore on 14 september 2014. nothing much to enjoy. the Q for the tram is so long that we decided to just take a walk. very common animals. The animal show is just ok for us. shouldn't have put this in ""places to visit"" list in sg"
,,waste of time,2.0,,the idea of a night safari sounded great..but we were disappointed as mostly we say...in very dim light sleepy animals doing nothing. very hard to see anything. we were totally unimpressed...
,,Nightzoo was amazing,5.0,,"I´ve tried this several years ago, and I wasn´t happy with it. I gave it another chance, and this time it was brilliant. We saw all the animals, very very close.. It´s very popular, be prepared for an hour or 2 in a queue"
,,A night zoo,3.0,,"It's a different experience coz it's a cage-less night zoo which we are generally not used to.

-Thumbuakar (fire) show - ok

-Creatures of the night - Definitely OVERRATED...I don't understand why so much hoopla about this show. It fell short of my expectations. Indian circus used to be far better than this one.

-Tram- Excellent ride but very short. You get to see the animals in dim light which you dont see anywhere else. The best part is there is no cage between you and the animals....for some ferocious ones like hyena and tigers there is a moat in between.
Forget about taking photos unless you have an SLR."
,,Night Safari was average,3.0,,"The Night Safari was average, the price was expensive for what it was and we never got onto the tram because the line was ridiculously long the entire night. The animal show was ok but not great. I think they need to instigate some kind of system where you reserve a time for the tram because the line was insane and you really don't get your money's worth standing in line for over an hour."
,,Worth a trip to see this,4.0,,"Great seeing animals in natural form at night. We went around the tram which stops briefly at the different animal habitats. You can also do one of the trails which walks around different species. The show at the end was ok, nothing amazing. The buffet dinner was also not that great."
,,Good,4.0,,"If you like animals it's worth the trip.
I enjoyed myself on the safari, but I wouldn't say that this is a must do or must see attraction.

The tram ride was enjoyable and it was nice to see the animals although some animals were not in the enclosures due to renovation or they could just not be seen.

The creatures of the night show was cancelled on my visit, due to storms being forecast, which was a shame but unavoidable.

The trails were decent but it was very difficult to read the map in the dark so it's best to just carry on and follow any path. It does mean you have the opportunity to see some animals like the lions much closer than the tram."
,,Worth the trip,5.0,,"Fantastic night. Travelled on tram thru jungle setting, all the animals within easy sight, no cages, very safe, as animials which could present a problem kept from humans by either moats or electric fences, the rest roam free close to roadway. Highy recommend."
,,A bit overrated,3.0,,"OK, let's get to the point. This is a zoo that's open only at night. I could stop right here, so I'll enter a break line and you can quit reading.

If you want to read on, here are the details. Only a place near the equator would be able to do that because the sun would set at such different times, including very late (In Singapore sunset varies only by about 30 minutes throughout the year). The main attraction is a tram ride. There are no doors and so you feel really close to the animals oftentimes separated only by a small moat. But honestly, it's not much different from a zoo. Although the area is moderately lit, it can still be hard to see the animals and don't even think of getting a decent photo. Then there is an animal show (which I missed so I cannot comment). Most of the rest of the park is a bunch of overpriced souvenirs and food shops. Funny thing: they give you a map but it's so dark there you can't really read it. Frankly, the tram ride would work so much better during day but then it wouldn't have been called Night Safari."
,,Chilling Experience,4.0,,It is something which is really wonderful and shouldn't be missed if you come to Singapore. Have a wonderful time with my friends in the tram which goes around the zoo in the dark.
,,Memorable experience,4.0,,Don't go to this place if you are not a true animal/nature lover. You might end up spoiling the adventure of others. I have seen some people coming just because of the review of the place and then making mess of the whole place by talking loudly and making fun of the animals. Its a quite tram ride that they take you through the zoo to show all the nocturnal animals. You may or may not see animals. the experience is really amazing unless some people around you don't start making noise and make fun of the animals :( & that was really bad. You can always get down on any of the station and can also take a walk. Its an experience in itself. We took Tram ride for the whole Safari at least thrice so that we can enjoy the ride without much of the noise of others. Don't miss the shows at the park.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"We went at night. It is the only night zoo that I know. Absolutely fascinating, A really beautiful setting."
,,Wonderful experience! Not to be missed!,5.0,,"The Night Safari is something which I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Singapore and looking at an experience different from the usual shopping/dining/Sentosa etc. It is a wonderful activity for the entire family or just couples/friends.

The entire area is very well planned with 2 great shows, dining options and most importantly - well-laid out animal enclosures.

Of course, it would always be humid/hot considering the weather in Singapore. Do get a brochure/map first thing when you land there to plan your next few hours at the Safari. Start off with walking a few trails if you aren't tired. Alternatively, start off with a few drinks/bite while watching the Thumbuakar (fire) show - it is very engaging! You can do the walking trails next, catch the 'Creatures of the Night' show (not to be missed) and get some dinner then. I would recommend ending your trip with taking the Tram as there are no queues late in the night - you can relax with the cool breeze blowing in your face as the tram winds through the 7 geographical regions.

Since the Night Safari is pretty far off from the city center or the other tourist areas, you can combine the visit to this place with the Singapore Zoo which is right next door. Start off your day at the Zoo and reach the Safari venue by 6-7 pm to relax/unwind before walking the trails and taking the tram. Of course, this itinerary would be a slightly tough with toddlers/little kids. Highly recommended activity in Singapore!"
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"This is a great way to end your evening. The Night Safari was fun and interesting - we really enjoyed the bats that fly around you in their exhibit (don't worry, they are fruit bats) as well as the kangaroo exhibit. There were so many interesting things to see after dark and don't miss out on the fire show that takes place outside the entrance as well as the animal show that takes place just inside. Great fun!"
,,Like the tram ride,5.0,,"Dislike: the long queue Like: the tram ride and nice commentary, it is rather unusual to be able to see animals at night. Most zoos close around 630pm but Night Safari is opened till 12am daily"
,,To experience,4.0,,"Great experience to have. If you think of snapping pictures of wildlife that active in night time, get yourself a high-res camera or you will end up having a blurry and black pictures. You could ride a tram to go around the zoo or on your foot. Amazing place"
,,Go here for the night zoo,5.0,,"This is definitely a must do in Singapore, go along after dark and see the animals in their habitats, its amazing what you can see once your eyes become accustomed to it. There are also some great shows & exhibits that are well worth popping into too. There is a train that you can hop on & off around the zoo too"
,,great theme park,4.0,,lots of things to do there is even a shuttle to see a lot of attractions kids will love this place take the bus system to reach this fabulous place will go back again
,,Not so thrilling,3.0,,"The Night Safari is an attraction which is not so thrilling as you don't have the feeling of experiencing an exciting adventure in the nature parks with the animals in their natural habitat.

For the Singapore Night Safari you have the feeling of visiting a man made area where animals have been kept just for the sake of money. The entrance fee is quite high. You have much nicer places to visit in Singapore.

I have already experienced night safari at the Kruger National Park so there is no comparison and once you are there you just don't want your holidays to end.

I would strongly recommend visitors to watch out before buying tickets for the Sing Night safari better go to the attractions at Sentosa."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,The night safari is amazing. The animals are far more active in the evening and it is an experience that should not be missed. A must do in Singapore
,,Premium Safari Adventure Tour is the only way to go!,5.0,,spend the money and do the Premium Safari Adventure Tour - private buggy & guide to educate you about all the animals and navigate the dark night safari. The buffet dinner is delicious! and the VIP seating to the show wasn't too bad either. Had an awesome time!
,,Nice for one time only,3.0,,Visiting this night zoo is nice for one time only it is good but the bad thing in it is the vision is not clear because the lighting is few.
,,Enjoy Tram ride and Nocturnal animals,4.0,,"After finishing River Safari I had been to Night Safari with my family members. It is the world's first Nocturnal zoo and a first class tourist attraction in Singapore. W e experienced the tram ride which had taken us through 7 geographical zones of the world for nearly 45 minutes.
We had the opportunity to see Himalayan Tahrs, wild Goats while passing through Himalayan Hills,Deers Sloth Bears (the Indian Sub Continent) zebras, giraffes, Hippos(Equatorial Africa)
Pig and Malayan Tiger(Indo-Malayan Region) Asian Elephants(Asian Forest) Asian Deer Sambar and Axis Deer (Nepal River Valley) Wild Cattles (Burmese).
Do not miss to see the 20 minutes animal presentation show. The fire show was extremely good and thrilling.
Overall we enjoyed the Night Safari."
,,Try the Night Safari - and the butterfly house,4.0,,"I must admit I am something of a sucker for zoos, but two aspects of Singapore Zoo are especially fun, as far as I am concerned.

One is the 'night safari' - where you get taken around the zoo after dark and get to see many of the animals who would otherwise be 'holed up' in their enclosures, Whilst slightly eerie, this was a great experience.

The other is the butterfly house, which has free-roaming butterflies in an enclosure you can wander around. very hot and humid (of course) but absolutely amazing."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,We did the Night Safari at Singapore Zoo. This attraction is extremely well organised. We all lined up for Safari trams.we visited the night show as well. I would recommend this attraction..
,,Walk the paths - don't take the train!,5.0,,"The night safari is amazing. I've never seen so many animals, I have never seen in nature before.

We went to the night safari in August at about 08pm. It was still very hot and humid in Singapore. Since there was a huge line for the train through the park, we decided to take the walk.

It was the best decision ever! There were hardly any other people and we had time to see and study the animals without any interference. It took us about 2 1/2 hours to do the whole tour, but it was very entertaining and not at all tiring.

The night safari is quite far from Singapore downtown. We took a cab and payed about 60 SGD one-way. It also took us about 40 Minutes to reach the zoo. But if you have some spare time in Singapure, do it! It's well worth it!"
,,Good but not as good as expected,3.0,,"Although we did enjoy the night safari, it was not as good as we had hoped it to be. The trails are a brilliant idea and they are very enjoyable. The creatures of the night show was good, and the fire show was absolutely excellent, definitely my favourite part. The tram was good and we got to see some amazing things, however some of the animals didn't look very happy, slightly small enclosures and a bit hungry to be honest which made the experience slightly disappointing."
,,A Must Visit!,5.0,,"It’s a very well organized tram ride through a night zoo. It’s real, safe and allows you a good viewing of animals, really close.

You can hear the sounds of various animals from lion roars to chirping of crickets to hippo grunts. You can see most of the wild animals that you wanted to see live, hippos, flamingos, lions, etc.

There are guides everywhere to help you out if you need them, which makes the experience even better."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,Had booked the night Safari and had to queue up for hours before getting the tram The tram ride was ok except that i found the animals a little bit too well behaved. As if they knew they had to stand still.
,,Breathtaking!!!!,5.0,,"Leaves you breathless, panting for more. Do not miss the Creatures of the Night Show immediately after the night safari. Its a must see attraction part."
,,Family Fun for All!,5.0,,"We loved everything about the Night Safari, from the Creatures of the Night show to each individual animal trails! We loved that Tram rides are frequent and there are Guides everywhere to help out whenever you need them."
,,Very Enjoyable,5.0,,Well priced and very informative. The show was great with a funny M.C and some very clever animals. Good mix of Asian and African animals. Well worth the visit.
,,Best Night zoo,3.0,,Night Safari is the best night zoo in Singaopore. It's amazing that you can see those animals that are awake during the night. You can also walk around the trails which to me is a good experience. Many places for dinner like bongo burgere over there :)
,,Fabulous nocturnal visit to the zoo,5.0,,"The buffet was tasty. The fishing cat trail was exciting as the cats were on the prowl. But the highlight was the team tried around the zoo seeing hippos, lions and the flamingoes. Well worth the visit."
,,Felt like I was in a real rainforest,5.0,,"Every Singaporean I know insisted that I visit the Night Safari and I'm really glad I took their advice. The wait for tickets and getting on the tram and getting into the night show was borderline insane. Nevertheless, still a great time! The show was actually only about 15 to 20-minutes but it was cute and fun for the most part. Take the time to walk the trails! I was surrounded nothing other than the chirping of crickets, croaking of frogs, and occasional roars from the lions. A little terrifying considering how dark most of the park was but the experience felt so authentic.

Tip for getting on the tram in a short amount of time: go to the last show available (930pm I believe?) and once it's over, book it to the tram line. No wait at all for me and my mom."
,,Night Safari at Singapore Zoo,1.0,,"Do not waste your money. We went in a small group on their 'quiet' time. Dinner was rushed, missed all the shows because 4000 other people decided to do this in the 'quiet' time aswell.. Lined up for more than an hour with thousands of other people. Was hot, cramped, uncomfortable and didn't get to see any animals.we actually wondered if the animals were animatrix?"
,,Must go!,5.0,,"Amazing to get so safely close to these wonderful animals. Tip. Go to a show and a quick trail before heading to the train, as the queues will have died down a bit. Ate in the outside courtyard. Food etc very expensive. Take mosquito repellent!"
,,Night Safari,5.0,,This had been recommended by friends and family and did not disappoint. However get there early (6pm) and get in the queue for the tram asap. We thought we'd walk round then get a later tram once the queue had gone down. How wrong were we. The queue got longer later! took us an hour to get on the tram. Do that first then walk around the three routes in the dark to see the rest of the animals. We still haven't worked out how they keep the animals in! Wear mosquito repellent!
,,OK but nothing to write home about.,3.0,,"Firstly I must point out that this is NOT a Safari. You are simply driven around in a tram along dark roads that pass animal enclosures. So we are talking about a Night Zoo. Yes as usual in Singapore everything is very well organised, queues although long moved relatively quickly, but just slowly enough to give you time to browse in the numerous retail outlets - all very clever to encourage you to shop. Food outlets are numerous and all cleverly placed to steer you through them, food is OK but nothing to write home about. Tram ride through the Zoo was OK, you do get a chance to see a few animals, but don't get your hopes up, this is a Zoo and they are housed in enclosures, some of which are small and in my opinion unsuitable. The Creatures of the Night Show is OK, albeit somewhat contrived. To sum it up -- I'm. Glad we visited but sadly will not be attending again. As previously mentioned this is a Zoo and Not a Safari as advertised."
,,Underwhelmed!,3.0,,"We purchased this as a dinner/tour combo. Dinner was buffet & was tasty. We joined the queue for the tram ride, which was described as the highlight. After queuing for over 1hr15mins, we eventually got on the tram. As the animals are in ""moonlight"" conditions, it seemed like everything was in black and white. Some of the animals were a little active but the tram moved on very quickly so you hardly had a chance to see them. By the time the tram ride finished, we had 2 minutes left before meeting up with our tour guide to go home! Honestly I wouldn't bother!"
,,Close encounter,4.0,,"A must visit. One of the best zoos I've been to. Friendly staff, very helpful. Close encounters with the animals, feels like you're part of the exhibit. Long queues everywhere though, a bit frustrating."
,,Long Queue but Worth the Waiting,4.0,,I went with my family and it was a long queue waiting for the tram tour. Everyone was sweating and exhausted but the scenery and animals were amazing. It was the first time we saw a tiger roll over and showing her belly. The otters were so cute and it was an enjoyable time. The only shortfall might be the MTR did not meet with the park closing time and you should be prepared to take a taxi back to hotel.
,,Wow,5.0,,"We went just after a thunderstorm so no queues, guess we were lucky. Everything was wet which made it cool and the animals all out and about. Watching the lions being fed you felt like you could touch them. To make the experience worthwhile take the train and also walk around so you miss nothing of all the nocturnal animals. Just absolutely loved it."
,,Riding on elephants,4.0,,Our 10 and 13 year-olds loved the zoo and so did we. Night Safari not as cool as the daytime experience as there were much longer queues and of course you dont see as much.
,,Good experience,4.0,,Took the trip to the night safari on a pre-booked tour with City Discovery. Firstly City Discovery I thought were very well organised when considering the amount of people they were moving to various locations with a number of options. Well done. Our 'guide' Ben did a good job. If you have ever been to any of these group things anywhere around the world you will expect to line up. And that is what we got but considering the animals don't come out until it's dark then that is to be expected and it wasn't really that bad. The guide at the safari was just okay really she sounded a bit like out of a B grade movie but she did definitely know her animals and to see so many of these animals up close and moving around and outside a cage was simply amazing. Then there was the animals show and the fire show following on. They were really good too. Finished off with a shared play of very tasty Indian food at a pretty reasonable price before hopping in the bus for the ride home and dropped at our hotel by our driver. Was a really enjoyable experience all round.
,,Why Not if you are there a couple days,4.0,,"If you are going to be in Singapore for more than a couple of days, I would definitely recommend taking a trip to the zoo at night.

You get to see the animals while they are more active, and the guides are all pretty good. There was a fairly long wait when we visited, but the line seemed to move, and the experience was rewarding enough.

Oh, and if you like sweets, you must stop and get some ice cream on the way out. Tons of flavors and very good!"
,,Overated and crowded,3.0,,"We were disappointed with the outing to the zoo. We only visited the Zoo at night on the Night Safari. The waiting time was long, the food areas were poor and the animals seen on the safari were few and far between. An overated, overpriced event."
,,You will never experience a better zoo...,5.0,,"This zoo opens at 7pm and in open until midnight.

It specializes in nocturnal animals and my goodness it is sooo worth it. Make sure you walk around the entire area as this is the only way to see all the hyenas, otters, white lions, tigers, zebras and giraffes. Then take the train as this is the only way to see the barking deer, elephants, tapirs, wolves and other giraffes and zebras."
,,Spectacular night safari,5.0,,"Night safari was a great attraction. No waiting lines as we were there during the week. Roughly 1 hour drive through animal areas - most without fences.

The zoo is a good drive from the city center. Easiest form of transport are express buses from some hotels. More local is taking the tube (train), changing 2 times and, finally, taking the bus to the zoo. Price via public transport is a bit cheaper but takes way longer."
,,Be prepared to queue!!,3.0,,"This is a brilliant idea and a great experience but honestly the queues are worse than peak season at Disney! If we were to visit again we would probably have some food, then do a couple of the walking trails, see one of the live shows (which are brilliant) and then go for the tram ride around the park.
Also be warned the queues for taxis to leave are also very long, we recommend booking for someone to pick you up or ringing ahead."
,,Amazing Night Safari,5.0,,"When we were there, the queue was humongous. However, the safari staff managed to control the queue well enough that we couldn't see any queue-jumpers. I would suggest to start off the visit by using the safari tram first as you are able to get an idea of the location of the animal enclosures. The safari tram also enables one to get close to the nocturnal creatures in their natural surroundings. You may also bring along some binoculars to get a better view from the tram itself. Overall a fantastic night safari and one the children would also love. Also suggest to go early to beat the queue."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Its a must do . When we visited the rain had just stopped and the sky's cleared up . The animals were in an excellent mood . We could see them enjoying nature . Would highly recommend . Also the animal show and rain dance was good .
,,Time Waste,2.0,,"We were very excited to go to night safari.. but when we boarded the tram which takes you to the night safari... it takes you to dark roads.. where on your both sides a number of animals are relaxing... i didnt find any great thing in that... this can also be seen in a normal zoo... plus.. lot many animals were sleeping when we were passing them... there was a lion sitting in an open area at 30 meters away from you... all other animals were relatively closer...
Didnt liked it...there is a show where animals perform some acts on the indications of few people in an amphitheatre... that was also not so good...

in all... I would suggest you to enjoy the city life of singapore..."
,,Amazing up close action,4.0,,"If your in Singapore and want a night out book this in your holiday as it is cool. The tram ride is great goes for 40mins and the animals r all active and easy to spot.

The zoo is open from 7 till 12am but is a fair distance from the city. U can get there yourself but from what I heard its quite an effort so most people come on tours.

Tours are easy to book with concierge of hotel and you have to ask yourself whats more important... max time with animals or a full belly!

Most tours went from 6 till 10.30 we chose belly and chose tour with buffet dinner. There r different kinds of buffet tours but we chose tour with multiple cuisines indo, malay, western and indian... some just offer indian and this iz a bit cheaper. We chose multiple cost 84 bucks cant rem name of tour comp but its run thru chinatown.

Only prob with this was dinner finished 8.30... then over hour wait in queue for tram.. we missed all animal shows and didnt get yo walk much but the food was so good it was worth it.

So def go, book tour with dinner 84 each without roughly 46 bucks."
,,Great place to visit - but -,3.0,,"It took us 90 minutes to get there from our hotel which was supposed to be a 30 minute trip. I lost my husband in a line when I needed to use toilet facilities. Found husband over 60 minutes later, still in line. The night zoofari was great but the crowds made it not enjoyable."
,,Well designed park for close encounters with animals at night,4.0,,"Visited the Night Safari three times, and still enjoyed it very much. Park officially opens at 7.30pm at night, but by about 6.45pm, queues start forming at the entrance and at about 7.20pm, visitors are allowed in. Most people would naturally go for the tram ride first, but my advice would be to go for the 7.30pm Show first then take the tram ride later when the queue clears up later. It is also a good idea to get off at the Eastern Lodge for a short walk for a different experience on foot before getting on the tram again for the second part of the ride."
,,Endless queues and disorganisation,3.0,,"Firstly let me say the concept of this night safari is amazing and when (after 2 hours) we actually got onto the safari bus and travelled around seeing the animals in their incredible habitats we enjoyed the experience. But don't bother unless you are tolerant of extremely long and disorganised queues, people pushing in and queue jumping and the high possibility of getting soaked when it rains and there is little shelter. We went on a package, with dinner included (not worth doing) and assumed there would be some timed ticketing element, allowing us to enjoy the independent walks also available. As it was we ate indifferent food, queued for hours, got wet and finally experienced about 20 minutes in a safari truck. Despite being asked to be quiet by the guide, who had an interesting commentary, we were treated to loud conversations and squeals from the family behind. The management certainly need to sort out the systems to make this a class attraction, which it has the potential to be."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,We were grateful of dry weather and headed here on the subway and bus. Which took nearly 1.5 hrs from Chinatown. If anything we felt arriving at 8:30pm didn't leave us enough time to see everything. The tram ride was great and informative. Walking the trails was spooky and you felt really close to the animals. Not massively keen on the ideas of zoos but this was a great experience!
,,"Don't miss, seriously!",5.0,,"We went last night, Thursday. It took two buses to get there so about 75 minutes of eat travel arriving at 8:20. The team line moved right along and it took 3 trans to get us on board. Later in the evening there was no line at all. After that we went to the show, short but fun. The walking path was the most interesting experience I have ever had at a zoo. They feed the animals close to the edge and even when they aren't eating they seem to be hanging around posing for you. I could have watched the little otters for hours screaming at us!!! I didn't go in the free flying bat house. Yuck! But then we went to a different area and still saw free fling bats. The male lion was so majestic, he was my husband's favorite. Watch the time. I looked at my clock when we were two thirds fine and it was already 10:45 so we started to walk a little faster. Buses run past midnight we learned when we got back to bus stop, two easy but rides and we were back at our Intercontinental hotel by Bugis St. There were lots of little children sleeping in their parents arms when we arrived so I would definitely make my kids take a nap before coming. Buses and trains are so easy to use. We have been here 9 days and I am a pro on them now having used $35 worth of rides."
,,Not worth it if you have done the Singapore Zoo in the morning and not doing the walking trail,2.0,,"We had to wait for more than an hour for the tram ride, kids tend to get cranky at such a long wait as the entrance is dimly lit and its too crowded. We couldnt do the walking trail as it gets too tiring if you have walked around in the Singapore zoo and the river safari during the day. The animals are no different than what we saw in the morning at the zoo. So not worth the wait and long queues."
,,great experience,5.0,,"never been and did to a night safari and it was really worth to went there even if it take you a very very long time!!
You can go by taxi must it will cost you at least 30 dollars and 45 minutes drive. By MRT and Bus it will cost you less than 5 dollars together but long trip ( at least 1h30). Once you arrived there prepared yourself for a long long queue (45 to 1hr) and then here we go for the tour. well organized, many wild animals to see and it is really different when you look at them in the night. The tour takes around 30 minutes. After that there is a show, funny and good one! Overall I really recommend the Night Safari Singapore even if it is super far..."
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"Tourist attractions in Singapore are usually executed perfectly and the Night Safari is no exception. I definitely recommend walking through instead of taking the train (if you get tired you can still get on at another stop). It takes several hours to see everything - and there was quite a lot of animals I had never seen or heard about. In fact I made a list of those animals to look up more infrormation on the Inernet later :)
The zoo is well maintained and - as far as I can judge - the animals seem to be in good shape and have sufficient space. Of course there’s lot of people if you don’t queue for the train right at the entrance then there should be no waiting times."
,,Night safari is worth it,4.0,,"Night safari is well worth it, get on the little train and bop round. Highlight was definitely the train stopping in between two enclosures, explaining that the hyenas (massive predators) were on our right and some goats (their prey) were on our left. Felt like I was right in the bloody jungle it did!"
,,Go at night for a special zoo experience!,5.0,,"The zoo in the day is quite good as far as zoos go, especially for such a small country. If you go at night, the zoo is really one of a kind! They turn on dim and infrared lights and allow visitors to go on a night safari through the zoo. Many animals are nocturnal so the animals are far more active and interesting to see at night than in the daytime when they just sleep. Really well done and you feel like you are viewing wild(ish) animals rather than animals simply sitting in a cage. Not cheap, but well worth it. Be prepared to wait in a decently long line but get there early to avoid it. Great!"
,,Night safari,4.0,,Walk the entire thing! Tram is not worth line wait . Walking gives you the opportunity to see everything up close Avoid the shows and enjoy the animals
,,Different experience with animals,4.0,,"The show with fire is really nothing special. But the night animal show is good except it is a bit short.
Walking and tram trail do give different views. But for walking trail, some animal just didn't want to show up.
Recommend to take the walking trail then only take the tram at the end to avoid long queue."
,,Great trip!,5.0,,"It would be long way from city to night safari zoo, taking mrt and then bus! It is around 1 hour! It would better if u visit Singapore zoo in the morning and then go to night safari! Because they are close and night safari opens at 7:30pm! You should enjoy two great shows in night safari and then should walk to discover night animals :))"
,,Night safari - over-rated and crowded,2.0,,"Night safari experience was underwhelming. Queued over 45 minutes to get through, some interesting animals to see but too many cows and other domestic animals weakened the impact. Would definitely not go again as very crowded and over-hyped for what it was, although I imagine it would be exciting and interesting for small children."
,,It's a zoo at night,4.0,,"Fun for the whole family. Expect a massive crowd at the entrance due to a lot of tourist groups. If you can buy your ticket online as it's cheaper and faster. Do not take the tram, you miss a lot. Walking tour is more fun and easy as it's in the night and not hot outside. Food is quite expensive so eat before you arrive. Buses available close by but don't wait till very late or you may have to cab it home. Don't miss the shows, the kids will love it. Lion feeding is also great to see."
,,Queueing for Queues,3.0,,"Arrived here with very high expectations (should have checked on trip advisor first!).

Had planned to attend one of the creatures of the night shows, take the tram ride around the park and do the walking trail. On arrival at 8pm we saw that the expected queueing time for the tram was 2 hours so went along for the 8.30pm animals of the night show, joined the queue and then noticed that the next show was scheduled for 9.30, when we asked about this we were told that the 8.30 show was already full and that the people in the queue were waiting to join the queue for the 9.30 show and were advise to return at 8.45 for the 9.30 show.

Decided that we didn’t want to waste 45 minutes queueing for a show so in the end only did the walking trail.

The trail itself was very good and I would still recommend that the night safari is worth a visit, just go expecting to have to wait in line. We will still go back, to do the show and tram ride again (the queues for the tram ride get less later in the evening)

If you are planing on visiting then I would recommend doing this separately to the zoo / river safari as there is a lot of walking / queueing involved in all of them and to do all together would be very tiring."
,,the wonderful experience i had never been!,5.0,,"it's like a jungle. but you can see the animal, sometimes, just next to you! it's so comfortable to take the shuttle bus around the zoo, the wind, the night, the tree, make me feel awesome, i even take twice ! And it's famous, so here is the suggestion: finish your dinner early, go to the night safari before the ticket counter opening, then you can avoid the long long waiting line."
,,Funnest zoo visit ever,4.0,,Visited the night safari with my Anerican backpacker friend whom I met in my hostel. We both loved it. There was non-stop entertainment. Loved the fire dance show at the beginning. They actually called my friend up when they choose someone from the audience to participate in the fire eating show. Was hilarious. Was nice seeing the animals at night. Many if them peaceful. Plus the theatre show they did. The staff pretend the snake is missing and start panicking. A few spectators began screaming and running. They obviously then said it was a joke. It was under our seat. Great fun!! One of those things to do if your in Simgapore.
,,Avoid on a Saturday night,2.0,,"Was recommended by a friend of a friend before our big move to oz!!!!
Sadly we were very disappointed as we paid $164 (2children 2adults) to ride round on a tram which took 1hr30ish to get on!
We saw a few animals but nothing you wouldn't see in a normal daytime zoo.
We arrived at 1945ish and was told to meet by the plane at 2230 for pick up or we would have to get a taxi/bus which I found abit rude. So after queuing for 45mins to get in and 1hr30ish to get on the tram we had no time to do anything else. :-(
We did book the river safari too but cancelled a day before as don't want the same experience again.
I would advise do not go on a Saturday night or when it's raining"
,,Something completely different,4.0,,"I organised this tour before we left Australia as it was something we hadn't done before. The tour bus picked us up from out hotel and we headed out there.

On the way the tour guide gave us some information about the Night Safari, explained about the train ride, the walking trails and the shows.

When we arrived we lined up for the train ride. The queue was quite long but moved quickly and we were on the train in less than 30 minutes. The tour around the zoo was great! To see a zoo in a 'different light' was fantastic and our kids (ages 10, 8 & 5) loved it! Some animals were asleep or difficult to see, but others were very active and so close we could almost touch them.

After the train ride we went on 2 of the walking trails with the intention of getting something to eat at the end of the second trail. The cafe out in the middle of the safari didn't have much to offer though and the wait time was too long so we walked back to the main building. By that time it was time to catch our tour bus back to the hotel, so we ended up ordering room service instead :-)

If I knew then what I know now I would probably get a taxi to and from the Night Safari even though it might be more expensive just so that we could spend a little longer there. I would also catch one or both of the shows first, then do the train ride around after. If there was time at the end of the night, then I'd tackle the walking trails. Also, I'd eat an early dinner before going, or at least make sure the kids eat an early dinner!

We felt a little bit rushed knowing at we had to be back at the tour bus by 10pm, so felt like we were trying to cram everything in.

On the whole though it was a great night and I would highly recommend this for people of all ages."
,,fantastic zoo,5.0,,fantastic zoo. with very nice settings and excellent shows (in particular the elephant show is a must see). Night safary is a real treat in the (semi) dark you really feel like you are in a tropical forrest!
,,Great attraction to visit at night,5.0,,"I was visiting Singapore for a conference and only had one night free before heading back home. This was a great attraction to visit with such limited time. Did it as a tour (can't remember name of the company) picked up from hotel and dropped back again. The guide was very entertaining and looked after us well. Travelling through the zoo at night, being incredibly close to the animals (at times almost able to touch some!) was a not to miss experience. Would definitely do this again."
,,Another way to explore the Zoo ...,4.0,,"In the dark all animals look the same ... (grey). Do they really - latest if you have been at the Night Safari you will know that they might be grey but have different shapes, behave differently and also the noise the produce sounds different !

During the day at the zoo, after dinner the night safari is a must in Singapore.

One of the drawbacks: we had huge queues and waited over one hour to get on one of the trains. If you decide walking it could be very hard if you are four or more to get back on one of the trains at one of the stops."
,,No big deal,3.0,,"I'm glad this attraction didn't cost a lot, otherwise I would have been quite disappointed. The little show they put on is quite funny, but the safari was boring. I couldn't wait to get off. Hardly saw any animals and the ones we did see were nothing exciting. I had the wrong idea, inking this would be a little like an African Safari, but I couldn't be more wrong."
,,Long queue....,3.0,,Nice place to visit ONCE if you are ready to wait around an hour for the tram and if you go there early .
,,Only for those who like queuing,2.0,,"1) Spent 20 minutes waiting to buy a ticket
2) Spent another hour queuing to go on the trams
3) Had to leave straight away after the tram ride to spend another 30 minutes queuing to get the bus to the station

Very disappointed with this attraction as the entrance fee is expensive and you certainly don’t get value for money. No staff around to deal with people who queue jumped and this resulted in many arguments in both the queue for the trams and for the buses at the end."
,,Useless,2.0,,"We went there for 7pm, got our tickets and prepared for a long long queue to get the electric train. After 1 hour of queue we got on the electric train just to see animals under sedatives that rarely moved and there was only an animal that was really near the train as the other ones had a ditch in front of them. Also we didn't get any photo as it's not allowed to use flash and everything was really dark.

Just a waste of time.."
,,"Excellent park, but unfortunately very crowded",5.0,,"I must admit visiting Night Safari at Singapore ZOO is a unique experience. First of all it is a chance to see the animals that are active in the night and are sleeping hidden in their huts during a usual daylight visit in a zoo. But it is not only that - some of the animals are a kind of free-ranging, so when we were passing by in the Zoo-vehicle they were standing 2-3 meters from us!
I was afraid we will not see much in the dark, but there is enough light on most important sites so you can really see a lot along your travel. It takes about 45 minutes in a guided tour by Zoo-vehicle to complete the journey and then you have an opportunity to walk by yourself in some areas of the park. Additionally, there is a show in the amphitheatre, which is nice but not necessary.
The only issue with the park is it is really crowded. Once you get to the vehicle, it is not a problem. But the queue to get there is a really long one, and if you are with small kids this may be a challenge. Still - worth it for sure!!!!!!!"
,,Great,5.0,,Great zoo lots to see however We would never go the night safari again as it is so hard to see the animals.
,,Just a zoo at night,3.0,,"Nothing much to be seen here except how the animals would look at night, especially the nocturnal ones. There is also a small program showing some animals and how they respond to human commands."
,,Night Safari - hints,3.0,,"Get there no later than 7pm and walk round the trails first - as soon as it gest dark you cant take any photo's unless you have a good camera. Take bug spray and re-apply as you get bitten to death otherwise.

You can taje your own drinks your bags aren't searched.

The queue for the tram can be over an hour so be prepared to entertain yourself during the long trawm up and down the line.

It is worth seeing as you have all the big animals you would expect and nice to see them at night - especially hearing the lions roar!

Other than that the shops are not very exciting and there is little to do.

Good to tick ofd but you wouldn't want to revisit"
,,Too Crowded,3.0,,"We visited on a Saturday night, and had to queue for over an hour just to get through the entrance, then for more than another hour to catch the tram. The actual tram ride was good - went for about 40 minutes, and you got to see lots of different animals, although only briefly. We didn't finish the tram ride till after 9:30pm, so that only left the 10:30pm Creatures Of The Night Show, which we decided to skip. We did do some of the walking trails, and wished we had spent more time doing this, rather than waiting in queues. Would love to visit again on a less busy night!"
,,A night of human herding,3.0,,"This was an expensive attraction. Definitely eat before you arrive as the food is very average for a premium price.
Much better to walk to see the animals. The queue for the tram is unbelievable. Yes it is dark so some animals it is hit or miss. Overall, you can get close to quite a few, but with so many noisy tourists it is not exactly conducive towards the animals showing themselves. Enjoyed the fishing cats and Cervils.
In the end missed the animal show but the fire eating show was quite interesting.
Overall, a mass of humanity - worse than Disney in Florida."
,,once is ok...,3.0,,just another zoo... the difference is the amount of people visiting the place :) we had to cover the entire park by foot as there was a waiting time of one and a half hours for the tram.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I went by Singapore Attractions Express to the Night Safari. It had 20 minutes delay on arrival at
Mandarin Oriental already, at least it was direct service without a transfer.
Later in the Zoo I took first the tram (place in the rear), had to wait few minutes only.
It was smooth ride with interesting presentation. I thought it went too fast so I went then through all the trails by foot. This was much better and little bit scary (I met few people on the way).
It was 1st time I saw animals during night in the zoo, good idea to offer this, impressive
experience."
,,Kinda disappointing,1.0,,I visited the Night Safari in Singapore 2 months ago with the family of a college friend. The experience was kinda disappointing to me because i was not able to see the animals. No flash photography is allowed very limited lights on the whole place because they said the animals animals are sleeping and only the nocturnal animals are of course awake. I saw an elephant or what i thought was an elephant because all i could see were silhouettes. I highly suggest you just go visit and see the Singapore Zoo during the day instead which is within the area. And i have not talked about the prices of food in the night safari. Everything is expensive! This is the only place jn Singapore where a can of Coke Zero costs SGD5.00 (current exchange ate would be USD4.00) prepare to shell out AT LEAST USD20.00 per person for food. The tour was a rip-off a total tourist trap. The kids didnt enjoy it too because tgey are also too sleepy to enjoy it and like what i said earlier not much animal to see.
,,Skip the tram ride and walk,3.0,,"This destination is a tourist hype, although it is rather complicated to get there. Once you are there, you can take a tram ride to see the animals in their semi-natural environment. The queue was long when we were there (50 minutes waiting time). Honestly to say, it is better to walk. You don’t miss much if you skip the tram ride. If you walk, there is more time to look for the animals that are not easy to find in the dark and to observe them. There are several trails to walk. The Wallaby trail is new and is themed around Australian nature and animals."
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"I was really looking forward to this tour, but did not enjoy the evening at all. The crowds and queues were overwhelming. You do get to see many different animals on the tram ride but The animal show was not worth the wait. There are much better ways to spend an evening in Singapore."
,,An OK zoo experience,3.0,,"This sounded so neat on paper, but I was a little overwhelmed when I actually went. I believe that they had just opened recently when I went in November 2013, so it might be nicer now. The cool part is that you are there in the dark when the animals are more likely to be active. The downside is ... well dark! It was hard to navigate around, and sometimes you heard more than you saw. I would not say it was a bad experience, but after having done the Singapore Zoo and the River Walk Zoo in Singapore, this was not nearly as nice."
,,Sensational!,5.0,,"I had been looking forward to this attraction for quite a while. Definitely worth the visit! Loved walking the trails, and have to say, feeding time is great! We were going to skip the tram ride as it was quite busy when we went. So glad we didn't! You see many different animals from the trails. Excellent!"
,,night safari,5.0,,"Absolutley incredible. Get off the tram and walk when you can,you get to see even more and get closer to the animals.we didn't and wished we had.the show in the outdoor arena was fun too"
,,Be sure to leave early!,3.0,,"Left our Sentosa hotel at 6 thinking we'd easily make the 7.30 Creatures of the Night Tour. Following the directions on their website, we went by mrt and bus which took 2 hours. Then faced long queues for a ticket, then to get in and then for the night tram. Only managed to do the tram ride and missed the 9.30 show. Going home found a bus which took only 30 mins to the city for $7 - wish I'd known about this before and got that bus there as well. To avoid queuing for the tram which is well over an hour, you can do the walking trails and then pick up the tram at various points where the tram stops to let people off to walk. Tram ride was good but was disappointed that the queue was so long there was no time left to do anything else. Suggest buying tickets online and getting there early."
,,highlight of singapore trip....,5.0,,"amazing.... was really thrilled, greatly done and well maintained... the tram trip was awesome and the trails freaks you out.. feels as if you are walking inside a real jungle... amazing experience, a must visit place....."
,,Avoid Fridays and weekends if you don't like crowds,3.0,,Joined a tour that allowed 2 hours at the park. Queues for the tram were 1.5 hours and 45 minutes for the show. No choice but to join the walking trails. Saw numerous animals in their natural habitats at night but there were some animals that can be seen only along the tram route. Suggest arriving at the park before nightfall/when park opens if possible and join the tram queues immediately before they snowball. Had an Ok experience but it could have been much better.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This zoo is by far the best I have ever visited. We visited the river safari, zoo and night safari on the same day. This led to a long 13 hour day of watching animals but at no point did we feel bored. We started with the river safari, you only need about 2 hours here if that. The main attraction is obviously the pandas and for those it was well worth visiting. The zoo itself is huge! So many different animals and a few shows to watch if you want a rest from walking. The feeding schedule is also in the leaflets and from what we saw the staff are on time with it. We finished with the night safari. This was the best part of the zoo. Being able to walk round at night and see nocturnal animals acting naturally was something special. The night safari also includes a tram ride which allows you to see most of the animals without the walk and with some information from a guide. A great day out to a great place! The overall price for the 3 parks was about 38gbp."
,,Meh--just another tourist trap,2.0,,"If you've never seen a zoo and you don't mind paying a lot of money for a 30-minute ride after a 90 minute wait in line, this is the attraction for you. Most of the animals were sleeping in view but you do see a few rarities such as the tapir, which I had never seen and was excited to view. The other animals are the same as you'd see in any other zoo, some in rather depressingly small accommodations. I would recommend taking the walks rather than the tram--poor kids waiting in line were hot and miserable. The fire show is cool but seemed more like chippendales breating fire. Souvenir shops and restaurants are grossly overpriced.
Don't waste your time getting tickets in advance on line or from a tour broker, because you still have to wait in line to exchange your voucher for actual tickets which seems to be the thing to do In Singapore.

To get to the zoo, you can take the MRT to the Ang Mo Kio station where you can then pick up the 138 bus. It takes about 75 minutes to get there and about 40 to get back to city centre all depending on the traffic. I think we had more fun seeing the city on our bus trip than we did at the actual Night Safari."
,,Even better than the last time!,4.0,,"Second visit. still very interesting visit. better go in, talk a walk around a the trails before lining up for the train ride. otherwise, with all the patrons waiting to get the ride, waste a lot of time! btw, not so easy to get taxi back at closing time!"
,,Singapore Queues!,3.0,,I think this was something we only realised upon doing this trip that singapore attractions have long queues! the night safari was no exception to get on the tram cars it was a 2hr wait! we decided to walk around instead fortunately we read this on tripadvisor prior and also watch the fire show out the front lucky everyone else was instead standing in the long queues so this wasnt crazy. We wanted to see some of the shows but these also had long queues 40min-1.30 wait something that doesnt gell well when you are taking toddlers! It is almost like it is oversold they need to either increase the number of night safari trams or decrease the patron numbers to make it enjoyable. I think we should have gone in the day although I dont know if it is as busy
,,Night trip,4.0,,Very much enjoyed the Night Safari. It was very disappointing that there were long queues however and we had no time to do the Walking Tour as we were with an organised bus trip.
,,Tourists using flash ruin the experience,3.0,,"Never have I witness such inconsiderate and ignorant people. It clearly says NO flash all over the zoo yet while on the tram I constantly had tourists using flash all over the place.

The queue for the tram is mental as well, we got there early and had everyone push in front of us.

I found the leopard exhibit quite small for such an energetic animal.

We got off the tram early and walked around the zoo ourselves. It was a lot better as it was quiet."
,,Cruel to keep the elephants and lions and hippos in those conditions!,1.0,,"60 minutes to queue for 30 minutes ride to see animals. It's cruel to keep magnificent animals like elephants, lions and hippos in terribly small areas like that. Hippos were sitting in A small puddle of water!"
,,The Queueing System For Tram Ride Needs A Review!,2.0,,"I agree with other reviewers that the queue system is very bad. The park rangers don' t know how to handle such a big crowd, especially on pre-holidays and holiday. I brought an overseas guest there on 8 August 2014 and the experience was bad. First, the tram ride queue had us queueing for an hour, with the big queue behind us going across the road to the other side of the riad getting on the trams first because a tour guide spoke to a ranger. Thisis a very unfair system. After the ride, when we wanted to go and watch the Creatures of the Night Show, there were no proper signs to the entrance and we had a lady ranger who made us go a big round and ten back to her place again because the starting queue should be somewhere near the entrance to the park. Then she lets people who just alighted at Tram Station 4 to queue up at her station after us. Such inflexibility leads to poor customer service. For the entrance tickets that we have paid, it is just not worth it to go for the tram rides early. One should go for the walking trails first when you go on pre- and on the holiday itself. Then be back at 9.45. p.m. For the Creatures of the Night Show. After the show, then go for the tram ride. The service should be better and the tram captains will stop for you to take in the view the narrator is showing you and for you to take pictures. However, if you have the time in Singapore, don't go during public holidays, the services will be really bad. I for one will not be goung there for a long, long time!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Fire breathers/dancers, Ben and Jerries, gift shops - before you even enter the safari itself there is plenty to entertain you. Once in the safari, you are taken on an open sided road train through the park where you truly feel up close and personal with the animals. You can feel a bit vulnerable near the lions and bears but I'm sure it's all safe and you have to keep telling yourself that when the lions roar! You can get out at a couple of stops to wander around pathways independently - recommend doing this. It is a night safari so it is dark and this really adds to the ambience.

We went by taxi as the MRT only takes you so far then you need to take a bus but we didn't have time. Taxi was very reasonably priced (can't remember how much but he did have wifi in his car!). We were a family with three teenagers (one who actually doesn't even like animals) and we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We got in for free as we had Singapore Tourist tickets."
,,A Different Experience - Walk the Trails,4.0,,"The Singapore night safari is a different and interesting experience. The zoo is setup so that you can see a variety of nocturnal animals under a simulated full moon. It has an eerie feel to it, and it is worth seeing. Remember no flash photography!
The safari consists of two parts. First, there is the 45 minute tram ride which takes you on a guided tour of the park. If you strike the safari on a busy night, then you may wait for longer than 45 minutes in the queue. The tram ride provides a good overview, and hopefully you will get a considerate group of passengers who are well behaved and allow everyone to enjoy the animals and they remember no flash photography. Second, there is the walk along the four respective trails which can be done in about 45 minutes. This takes you to other parts that the tram ride does not go to, and is a relaxing walk on a sealed path through the rainforest. This is more enjoyable than the tram ride.
There are a selection of shows during the evening, but we did not see these as we spent almost an hour in the queue to get on the tram.
We used a tour operator that picked us up from our hotel. Alternatively, you could use either public transport or a taxi to get to and from the park.
Thanks for your vote if you found this review helpful.
There is the usual range of gift shops and eating venues at the night safari."
,,Must Walk the Trails,5.0,,"Part of the safari can be visited by the tram only, and part of it can be visited on foot only. While most people won't miss the tram, they may miss the trails. Most animals are more active at night. By walking the trails, you will be able to see them in action. What fascinated me most is the visit to the mangrove bats. The keepers will hang fruit on the trees, and you will be able to watch those bats eat fruit. A little bit scared at the beginning, but I found those bats cute while watching them!"
,,Big disappointment,2.0,,"Unfortunately, our Night Safari experience was a huge disappointment. Essentially, it is a drive... through a zoo... when it's dark.

The queues were unbearably long and the heat and humidity was equally as bad that night. The first thing most people do is get on the tram ride (the queue for which was an hour and a half) around the enclosures where you see every normal zoo animal - with many, many types of deer! It would appear that the majority of animals were kept in their small display areas by electrified fences which, to me, doesn't sound like a safari. I felt as if I was a victim of false advertising.

Too expensive for what you actually get.

However, the staff were friendly and happy but unfortunately didn't seem to really that their customers were starting to get quite irritated by in stupidly long waiting times.

People say you must do the night safari as it is unique to Singapore but I say do it if you're that desperate, otherwise spend an evening wandering about the city. It's a much better use of your precious time."
,,Must go,5.0,,I arrived there at around 1600 and it look not yet opened. Their staff told me the animal shows will start at 1730. Their Savanna Safari and Predator Prowl show must watch. Don't. Miss it
,,Very deceptive - the animals are more restricted than you think,1.0,,"Found this a horrible experience. It sounded great as I am not a fan of zoos and keeping animals in small spaces, but at the same time am fascinated to see them if it is possible without putting them in a cage. It sounded like a safari - i.e. animals able to roam, natural or almost natural habitat etc. It is not. The animals are in very small spaces with little or no opportunity to hide from people staring at them quite close up. The enclosures and cages just look bigger because of clever use of mirrors and black backdrops etc which make tourists think the animals have freedom. They don't! I found it worse than a traditional zoo as it was pretending to be something it's not."
,,Disappointed.,2.0,,"This is the first time visiting for the kids. Went with lots of anticipation and excitement, only to be met with long confusing queues and crowds everywhere. 1) We queued for 45 mins to buy the tickets. 2) The queue for the tram needed another 45mins-1hr. 3) The Night Show was full when we reached 1 hour before and the later timing will be too late for the kids. 4) We were on time to catch the Lions feeding but didn't see any lions at all in the enclosure. Overall, very disappointing."
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,Our two families enjoyed the tram ride for Night Safari. The guides make it very easy to see the animals in their lit exhibits and it's much cooler to be outside when the sun is not out. We wish we'd left more time to enjoy the musicians who were also playing that evening.
,,Walking Trail.,5.0,,Crazy lines to the tram and the show. better take the walking trail. will save u lots of time and enjoy the night safari to its fullest
,,Go later and void the crowds!!,4.0,,"This was my second trip to the Night Safari, and I still love it! My main piece of advice for anyone looking to go is; GO AS LATE AS POSSIBLE!! The Night Safari is open until midnight, and I urge any people wanting to go, to wait until after 9pm. I know this makes it hard for kids, but I assure you, you will have a much better experience. Avoid going as part of a tour group as you will be there at the same time as every other tour group on the Island. I Cannot stress this enough. We got to see the feeding of some of the animals (around 10:30pm I think). The tram rides are really good for a look around, but it is a must to take your self around on the trails and look at all the animals at your own pace as well. Singapore night Safari is a brilliant experience!!!"
,,Poor Show,2.0,,"This seems a only a marketing hype , most disappointing attraction in Singapore , few cows and buffaloes , you don't get real feel safari with this ."
,,Awesome and a great experience.,5.0,,"This is a fantastic experience, a new perspective of seeing the animals in the dark. We saw the show first then waiting in the long line to get the tram. I think it's probably better to see the show then go walking around the park yourself and then catch the tram later when there aren't so many people and it's quieter. Then you will have better use of time, as we had to rush around after the tram as had to catch the coach at 1030pm. A lot of the animals are sleeping. It's still an awesome experience in the dark. Definitely worth doing."
,,Great Attraction - Poor People Management,3.0,,"The Night Safari is an absolute must do in Singapore and one of the places I automatically take my visitors to. The animals are so close to you and unencumbered by fences and walls. This is a great experience.

The people management is what lets this park down. As you enter there is a long line that extends to the carriage entry. The carriages are what transports you around the park. You automatically join this line but you actually need to go to the left and get tickets before you enter the line, There is no signage or directions from staff to tell you this. Secondly the staff will suddenly divert the line to the right to make the line seem less - this is crazy."
,,Nighty-Nite in the Night Safari,3.0,,"While I have been a regular visitor to the Singapore Zoo , this was my first visit to the Night Safari after it opened 20 years ago.

While I have heard great things about it, must admit I was disappointed with what I experienced.

Firstly, the crowd was bad. But then again, since it was a Sunday before a public holiday, I guess that's to be expected. However, the crowd management leaves much to be desired. While there were lanes drawn out for the tram rides and to the show, there was a lack of control on these lanes as there were a number of queue jumpers!

I was also disappointed with the tram ride as we really couldn't see the animals as the habitants were either too dark or the animals were all at the back in the shadows, hiding from our sight. While I understand this is a Night Safari, a little illumination, perhaps simulating a night with a full moon, would help.

Overall, I don't see myself going back anytime soon."
,,Good Zoo-Reasonable price,4.0,,"Went on Saturday night so was busy but still lots of time to explore even after waiting for park tram.

If you do get to the park and is a massive line, go through the Wallaby walk first and by the time you get back line is gone down. Good hint in particular if u have little ones. walk rm for a while and then take em for the tram ride to recover.

Food not too badly priced either"
,,Fun to see animals at night,4.0,,Very neat to see the animals active during the night. Do not take the tram because the crowds are ridiculous! Instead walk the zoo and go immediately to the right on the Cat Fishing Trail. I read this and it was the best trip.
,,Best time during full moon,4.0,,"It was on of the best trip in SG. Mostly because the time and everything. The weather was pretty and it was full moon. My wife and I had a helluva fun, We took the tram once, because walking in the rain forest was full of fun. We could still smell the after rain scent and moon was peeking between the trees. In one word, the experience was fabulous!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A brilliant experience in Singapore. Tourists must visit this place. It is an exciting journey admist the wilderness of the nature. Also, dont miss the animal show."
,,dont do it,1.0,,we went during the week so not at its busiest but it was still over crowded and terrible to get around and the only thing to do is the tram and it was impossible to get on DONT GO
,,Poor directions and not enough time!,3.0,,"The zoo itself was good value. However our guide through Viator, whilst being very pleasant, knowledgeable and informative on the bus ride out, once inside the gates we were pretty well left to our own devices to find our way around after dinner.

The downside was that after doing the tram tour, followed by part of the walking tour at a fast pace, we returned to the main area to discover that the Live Show (fire eating) was already over.
OK, we thought, we'll go to the Night Encounter with the animals at 9:30.
""No,"" said the attendant, ""there are no more shows tonight"".

We were extremely disappointed that the tickets showed a performance at 9:30, but we were told by an employee that there were no more shows.

We went to have an ice cream, but found the drinks and ice creams were exorbitantly priced, so we sat and drank our water till the bus came to take us home.

It was then that we were informed by fellow travellers that there HAD been a 9:30 show after all! Most had skipped the walking tour to make time to see the show.

We came away disappointed that despite the USD134 ticket costs (for 2), the tight time frame allowed by Viator pretty much prevented us and most others on our bus from doing both the tram ride and the walking tour and returning in time to see the Live Show and the Night Encounters.

We were also disappointed that the Viator guide was not more available to seek advice and directions from, regarding the whereabouts of the various shows.

We were quite angry that the attendant we spoke to gave us wrong information about the Night Encounters show, causing us to miss it.

We had paid full price for our tickets, but missed two of the important attractions because of lack of time and incorrect information.

Not good enough Viator, or Night Safari!"
,,terrible experience,1.0,,"It is one of the worst place I ever visited in Singapore, highly mismanaged,on weekends, longer queues with no or little supervision and when asked for complain, arrogant volunteers blamed us. Highly overpriced attraction. not worth to waste time there. Singapore Zoo and bird park are far more better. Overall bad experience."
,,Skip the tram!,3.0,,"We arrived on a Tuesday evening, not expecting crowds on a week day but we were wrong. Lines were outrageous to get in, and we waited about 45 minutes to ride the tram. It's very humid, and somewhat hot so the wait is miserable. If you're able to walk, skip the trams and walk the trails. You can linger longer and see the animals more.
It was too hot for the regular zoo during the day which is why we chose the night Safari. It did seem pricey and somewhat like a tourist trap but still a cool experience if you have the time."
,,Night Safari July 2014,4.0,,We did the night safari on a day that we also did the zoo and the river safari! By the time we got to the night safari we were tired! We had dinner at the burger place at the night safari. The river safari closes at 6 and the night safari opens at 7:30 but the restaurants are open by 5:30. We had time for dinner and then got in line. It was a busy night and lines were long. The tram ride is included and is a 40 minute tour of the park. When we finished the tram ride the next show at the amphitheater was already full and the lines were really long so we gave up. We had no energy to do the walking trails - but they probably would have been fun in the dark! I would recommend doing the night safari on a day when you didn't have too much walking already!
,,Night Zoo is amazing,5.0,,"Worth the trip to the zoo at night, just don't try and take any photos! Discount off your ticket if flown Singapore airlines, take your flight details, great staff telling us this. Value for money and a unique experience."
,,fantastic evening,5.0,,"We had linda chan as ouf guide and she was fantastic. She really made the evening a lot of fun. The animals were amazing to see in the night. The night started out as we were all strangers but she soon put us at ease and we enjoyed each others company. Linda was amazing and if you have the opportunity to have her as your guide you will have a fantastic evening.

Kiiwi travellers"
,,WOW,5.0,,"Naturally the lines were long and it took awhile, but it was so worth it! The live show was so cute, and the ride itself was fun.. Overall, it was a wonderful night and can't wait to go there again with my friends."
,,Fantastic evening,5.0,,"My husband son and I really enjoyed the night safari. There is plenty to see and everything was well sign posted and organised.

We did the walking trails as well as the tram ride to get the full experience. We also enjoyed the show.

We caught a taxi to and from the Night Safari which was very easy to do. It is unnecessary to take a tour to do this attraction.

We did cover up our legs and wore closed shoes to avoid mosquitoes , however didn't really see any.

Very enjoyable evening."
,,Unique Experience!,5.0,,"I don't get the recent reviews, I went there with my friends and I really loved the whole experience. I waited in the line for about 15 minutes and everything else went smooth. Highly suggest it!"
,,Night in the jungle,5.0,,Nice place - a little expensive any many tourist😉 the safari was an great experience but the show was not great fun. A little boring. Fireshow was very good. 2 shows and 1 safari in total it was a fun trip
,,Ideal for Family,5.0,,"1. If you want to avoid hot weather, night safari is a good choose.
2. Recommend to avoid Friday to Sunday, as weekday can save time to queues up, also enjoy more things.
3. Food is expensive, expected for such world class places, so best got dinner first before go there, bring along your water if can.
4. WheelChair access not a problem , the train ride is a good one for elder to enjoy watching the animals with cool environment.
5. Suggest watch 1st Show of Thumbuakar Performance first at 1845hrs, then follow by 1930hrs Creatures of the Night Show, before taking the train ride.
and after the train ride, can watch 2200hrs Thumbakar Performance again if you go on Friday, Saturday & eve of Public Holidays.

for those plan to visit Jurong Bird Park, Zoo etc within few days of stay, buy the ticket that offer discount, can save quite a sum of money.

Overall, a good experience, my Mum love it too."
,,Extremely crowded but interesting,3.0,,We went to the Night Safari during the Hari Raya holiday and it was extremely crowded. The park did all they could to make things run smoothly but we waited at least 45 minutes to do the tram ride. After that it was so late that we didn't do any of the walks. I would recommend going on a less crowded time. They were having a special deal where you were able to walk through the River Safari for free so that was a nice bonus. We ate dinner at Bongo Burgers which was surprisingly good food for a zoo. The fire show was entertaining even if the guys doing it looked a bit bored.
,,The best zoo in the world,5.0,,I have never been to a zoo where the animals are so naturally presented and are so seemingly relaxed. Wonderfully set out; we stayed to have an evening meal and then went to the evening shows at nighttime safari ride. One of my most memorable holiday experiences. Try to make sure you see the white tigers being fed - unmissable!
,,Interesting but flawed,3.0,,"It's impossible not be in in awe at some of the animals you get to see whilst driving around the complex. Was it worth the drive here? Nope. Was it worth the queue? Nope. Put a David Attenborough dvd on, or go to Kenya. If you do decide to come here, bring your own drinks and food, as the on site restaurants seemed to have been put up at the last minute in order to tug some more at the tourist dollars they can sense hiding unspent in your pocket. The burger outlet was particularly uninspiring."
,,Too expensive for too long queues,2.0,,"we visited the night safari on or 6.5h stop over in Singapore.

It is the easiest and fastest way to take a taxi for both ways (family of 3).

We purchased the tickets in advance at the airport in order to avoid any queuing at the enterence. Unfortunately we still had to queue, since they let people in the advanced purchased queue. Poorly managed and lots of hectiques.

We asked when is the best time to take the tram. The lady advised us to take the tram around 20.30, since the queue is now long. So we had dinner first.. also very slowly, so it took us nearly 1 hour.. just for a dish to share.

The queue at 20.15 wa now more than 1 h and we waited all that time. Very disappointing. So we finally only managed to take the tram and could not see the shows nor the night walks. It qas 22.00 when we returned from the tram ride. The animals were mostly all types of asian deers. At the end we saw a few elephants, and the tiger etc were hiding.

Overall it was very disappointing for the money spent and the little we have seen."
,,Nothing to special. Better skip this one,2.0,,The animals there are almost the same animals that you can see at Singapore Zoo. Some animals are not even visible because of the dark surroundings.
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,Like: The curry restaurant in the food court. The patient and kind service of ticket seller at booth Dislike: The very long wait to get the tram ride. Hot and uncomfortable.
,,Poor management- its only about money,2.0,,"We had our tickets booked well in advance, reached the night Safari one hour ahead only to find several tour groups ahead of us. And people kept coming and coming. Took 45 minutes in the queue to get in and 1 1/2 hours with our 6 year old to get on the tram. When we thought we were next to board the tram, we were cordoned off and asked to join the very end of a long queue. They were elderly in the queue, most children were irritable in the queue and the heat. We wanted to go off on the walking trail, but we were hearded around like sheep and it was an ocean of people, we lost all bearings . There should be a restriction on the number of tickets. It shouldn't be about the money, people could get really sick here. This kind of attitude about just raking in the moolah is ridiculous. The Singapore Zoo has a name, this way they are going to tarnish it. Would take a walk in a zoo come day or night. No joy here."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Did both day and night. Night safari is great experience. Need to provide facilities to take breath and cooling down, very humid to walk around. need water at every location."
,,"Long, Long Wait for a short ride",3.0,,"It took so long in line for the tram ride that I was only able to see the Fire Show after it and that was while waiting in line to get something to eat. I was on a tour so had a hard deadline of 10:05 pm for the trip back to town.

Would I go again? No. Too much time waiting for a very short ride to see the animals. It's a great idea, but way too crowded.

I would advise people to walk about first and then do the tram rides. The line was much shorter later in the evening.

I did see lots of animals including the lions. I did not see the tiger. By the time my car went past it, I could not see it. I sat on the right side of the tram which seemed to have the most animals - at least the ones I wanted to see."
,,Dont go if it's raining,3.0,,"We queued up for about an hour at the entrance so once we were allowed in we decided to watch the show, which after queuing for over 20 minutes they tell us is cancelled due to the rain. By now the queue for the tram around the park is over an hour long and after spending a day walking around the zoo, standing for that amount of time was not an option, nor was walking around the park so our only option was to call it a day and leave. Very disappointing after looking forward to this unique experience. Tip: Don't do both the zoo and night safari in one day"
,,Don't bother,1.0,,"Where do I start? This was on the top of my list of things to do in Singapore. If you liked to be pushed along in a shuffling hot sweaty crowd, then you might like this. We went to the feeding of the tigers and got there early but 15 minutes after the scheduled time and no action we left. Sighting of the animals was poor and really all it was, was a walk around in the dark with not much to see. The crowds were out of control and the lines to get on the tram unbelievable. When we finally went on the tram later in the night, it was ok but for the time, energy and money, definitely better things to do in Singapore. Feeling very disappointed however, the staff were very polite."
,,Well Organized,3.0,,Even though there isn't nothing much when compared to the natural wildlife safaris. Here everything is made artificially and organized very well for a quick and easy view of the wildlife
,,"Crowded, Fake Animals, Short time",2.0,,"Have visited with family in June 2014. Was a major disappointment with 2 shows out of 3 were housefull about 10 minutes before the start time. Long queue in the Tram waiting. Took about 1 hour in wait. Night Safari starts at 19.30 and last bus leaves at 23.00. So you are too pressed for time and can't afford to lose 1 hour in waiting.
This all could still be digested by someone if at the end the animals were interesting to look at.
With a careful eye and a smart brain, in few minutes you can guess that the movements are mechanical and I would go to the extent in saying that all animals shown on the tram ride are fake. All that is under the cover of very dim light and ofcourse the 'night' to cover things up so you can not find the details in the daylight.
There is so much more to see in Singapore and I would not recommend spending money and time in visiting the night safari unless you have visited all other attractions and still have time to kill."
,,Walk around and watch the animals closer,4.0,,"Grab the map first. It will be available at the 'Safari' reception itself. Start with the fire show. You can get a tram ride, but its better if you can walk around the open zoo and watch all animals closer. Be aware of the 'Animal Show' timing. Its nothing but some night animals. Don't worry if you missed the show for a 'Walk Around', because you can feel animals that much close. Use the map to spot the place where different animals are."
,,"Too busy, tourist trap!",1.0,,"I felt like it was a cattle market, all of us herded around where they wanted us to go! We hated every minute and got out as soon as we could. The staff were pleasant and helpful but it didn't make up for the fact that it was so crowded. A true tourist trap, best to be avoided unless you don't mind that kind of thing."
,,"Over crowded, but neat idea",3.0,,"After doing a quick visit to the Singapore Zoo, River Safari we headed to the Night Safari. They have it set up so you can purchase drinks and food before the Safari opens after the zoo and River Safari close. We were really excited for the Night Safari because of all the hype but we were a bit let down. It was crazy busy with extremely long rides to get on the tram to go around the park (which is required to see most of it). This was a Thursday night so we weren't expecting how busy it would be. We took in one of the night shows which was fun before attempting to get on the tram or walk in the walking area. We only did the tram for part of Safari and ended up leaving early. We had purchased the iVenture pass so we were able to participate in many attractions - I highly recommend that if you are looking to save money."
,,Decent. Kids will love it.,4.0,,"Singapore zoo is split into 3 zones, day zoo, river safari & night safari. The entrance for all these 3 are next to each other. After finishing the zoo and river safari, we took a break before going to the night safari. It being a Friday, the place was packed - the queue was pretty long for the team ride. It's a nice, relaxed way of seeing the park with a commentary from the tram driver. Could things I find annoying, people chatting on the tram and one another occasion, the lion or tiger was roaring, and the tram driver didn't stop his commentary .. he went on and on like a broken record. How awesome would it have been to hear the roar in silence.
Kids would love this place, no doubt. Adults will have a nice relaxing time. It was almost a 2.5 hour thing for us."
,,"Crowded beyond capacity, too full and noisy to be enjoyed",2.0,,"We booked, arrived early and still the lines were very long and the place hot and crowded. The wait for a tram to go around the park was 25 minutes but by the time we got back the animal show was full and we were recommended to again line up for another half an hour for the next show. As a family with young children waiting, in the dark, at night, in heat over and over was not great and we left after an hour and a half. I wouldn't go with kids under 10, and then I would probably suggest that the regular singapore zoo is a much much better option with many more animals and is more accessible."
,,An interesting twist on a zoo,5.0,,"The Singapore zoo has been split into 3 themed areas: the day zoo, the night zoo, and the river zoo. We only had time for one trip - the night zoo [which we had booked with an inclusive food option]. The food was an Asian buffet,. Perfectly adequate and tasty. After that there is a 1 hour tram ride that takes in most of the animals and gives some explanation, and then the option to walk on some themed trails., All very good, and very well-organised."
,,Enjoyable way to spend the evening,4.0,,"We first visited this attraction when my youngest son was 6 - he is now 16 and it was the first thing he asked if we could do on our Singapore Stopover. The tram ride queue was really long so my advice to you would be to go and see the shows first and then do the tram ride when it is a lot quieter.
The trip round on the tram is good although they don't stop very long so that you can get pictures but it gives you your bearings and you can then get off and walk which is when it comes into its own. You feel like there is nothing really stopping the animals getting to you which I found quite unnerving when we stopped at the hyena enclosure!
All in all it was a lovely way to spend an evening. We were on a special attractions package with Singapore Airlines so we didn't actually pay to get in which was an even bigger bonus."
,,Gone downhill,2.0,,"I remembered our first visit about 5 years ago and it was fantastic! We enjoyed the shows , the tram ride and the walks and we took very young children with us then. They were 6 and 3 at the time . Fast forward 5 years, the Night safari has become a victim of its success. We decided to go for the first show as the children in our group of 2 families were fairly young. We thought they would not be able to last much past 9 pm. Once out the queues were so long it took 45 minutes to board a tram. Bear in mind that this was not a weekend but mid week. There were quite a few tour groups. Having queued for so long , there were few takers to descend and do a walk trail at the next station. We feared that we would not be able to board without a similar wait time. It looked like people who were waiting to board at that station had a long wait ahead. After the ride , the narration was a bit un synced as the guide was obviously speaking towards the first car in the tram. So we did not actually see what he was describing until a good 5 minutes later ! As soon as the tram ride ended we disembarked and called it a night. What was a great attraction has been overwhelmed by the numbers of people that visit . It just does not have the capacity to cope with the visitor numbers."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,It was an enjoyable experience walking through the rainforest at night up close to the animals. You can walk the trails and well as hop on the tram. Be prepared for the crowds as this attraction is very popular. Definitely recommend it.
,,Night safari,3.0,,I expected a lot more since I was there alone in 2001. I took my family this time and the lines were too long. We waited over an hour for the train ride by which time my daughter was tired and slept. They should have an express option for young families as the safari doesn't open until 7.30pm
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"The Night Safari was really good and we would recommend it. It was very cool to see the animals at night and to walk around in the jungle to see them all. However, we arranged our visit there through a hotel shuttle service and this made us late as the shuttle took us to meet others from other hotels, and then we waited for a main coach. The guide on the coach once it arrived was really good though."
,,Premium Experience,5.0,,"We visited last Monday evening and couldn't say enough about how fabulous this experience was! Had paid for the premium adventure and we were certainly given everything that was promised, our guide was fabulous and so patient with the constant chatter from our children who were just so excited by everything. Cannot believe we were allowed to hand feed the elephants :-) Only complaint we had was the price of the beers in the restaurant prior to our tour - $SD27 for 2 tigers!!"
,,Amazing close up views of animals feeling like their natural environment.,5.0,,"The must do free night 'Tram' took us on a 40 minute trip around exotic animals. We got close up to them all and they looked much more natural than the normal zoo experience. The animals were really active and didn't shy away.

The 'Creatures of the Night' show was also excellent. The presenters were very engaging and the animals were very active and put on a good show.

The whole family really enjoyed it and we'd absolutely recommend this high quality and unique attraction."
,,A bit dissapointing on a few levels,2.0,,"A good concept, but it can't cope with the crowds.
It is very expensive and you only get a limited time there - much of which can be spent standing in queues - even at a very quiet time. Many of the animals - especially the larger ones can only be seen on the tram ride.
Lots of animals in small areas and normally diurnal animals active at night, makes you think the enclosures are very small to force the animals to where people can see them - you can't see the cage boundaries in the dark :-). Many animals show typical caged behaviour of repetitive movements which kind of confirms that.
Taking advice from other reviews, we arrived at 8pm, only to find a one hour wait for the tram ride and the first show full. We set out on the Fishing Cat Trail. The fishing cats were interesting, mainly because we got talking to a keeper who was throwing food in to bring the fish closer to the cats. As with any zoo, a fair proportion of the animals were not visible.
We arrived back at the show 20min before the start of the next show to find it already full - there are only 2 shows per night. We waited half an hour for the 45min tram ride. The problem with the tram is that it doesn't stop, so you get close but fleeting glimpses of the bigger animals which is not much good.
Overall a good idea if the animals were housed in better conditions and the tram was able to stop at each enclosure to give you a good look.
Being an ex-zookeeper, I was very dissapointed in the way most of the anmals were housed and behaving, so much so that it put us off going to the day time zoo."
,,Animal nightlife!!,5.0,,"This was a brilliant way to see animals in the night. Managed so beautifully. It's a must do and more fun at night. My son and me explored most of the area on foot and then took one last tram ride.
Do visit the souvenir shop as the quality of things you get here is way better than the quality outside. Thats the extra dollar you pay...for the quality!"
,,good night out,4.0,,"The place is very good if you love trekking however if you feel lazy or unable to walk around you can always stay in the tram that drives you around.
In our case we decided to stay in the tram for my mother cannot walk long distance and it is obviously not advisable to use her wheelchair...
Be prepared to queue for a long way though for a lot of people visits the place."
,,For children and keen enthusiasts only,3.0,,"Keen to see the animals in a more natural environment my husband and I paid the $30 taxi fare to get to the zoo. I read that it was advisable to get there early but I was horrified at the queue that snaked in front of us as we waited in line at 7.15pm for the 7.30pm opening. I actually think it's better waiting till later (after 8pm) when the crowds have dispersed to get there. It was quite a cool experience but it wasn't cheap and we paid $11 for one ice-cream, just a big rip-off."
,,Great way to spend a night in Singapore,5.0,,"This was my 3rd time visiting Night Safari and I still enjoyed it as much as my first visit. I really don't understand how some reviewers complain about not being able to see animals and it's not worth the money. Isn't it all part of experience that you may or may not be able to see the animals? Too dark? Have to be able to see everything every time? Then it probably isn't the kind of attraction for you. It was rather fun trying to find where the animals might be hiding and it was like ""Yes"" moment when we could see them.

The best way to enjoy Night Safari is to do the Trail Walk first. As you enter the park, ignore the huge lines for the Tram ride, go to your left and start the Trail Walk. There are very few people and you can enjoy the walk and have plenty of time to look for animals. We got to see pretty much all the animals on exhibits and was lucky enough to see Otters getting snakcs from the park ranger. The otters knew it was a snack time and they were waiting at the very front for their food. They were absolutely gorgeous! Depends on how quickly you want to walk, it would take 1.5-3 hours to complete the walk. By the time we were back to the entrance, there were ""NOBODY"" at the Tram station! We only waited 5 minutes for the ride. The guide was fantastic and you could see they were really well trained. Like other reviewers were saying, it really was dissapointing to see some rude people use flash even if they were told not to use it so many times, I had to yell out to them as I was so annoyed.

Yes it is hot and steamy and there are lots of people around but I wouldn't miss Night Safari when I visit Singapore. If you don't like animals, then it may not be your choice. If you do, then you would have a wonderful time!"
,,The Zoo is actually on the human side of the fence,1.0,,"We visited the Night Safari expecting to be an intimate experience with nighttime animals. What we got was a chaotic environment that was way overcrowded with visitors. The line for the tram was close to an hour – and it got longer after we got in line. If you wanted to see a show, you had to get to the venue close to an hour early in order to get a seat.

When you board the tram, the guide asked everyone onboard to remain quiet in order not to disturb the animals, but she keep talking over the loud speaker during the whole trip – louder than any passenger could be. Makes no sense!

Obviously, the concern here is for money and not for the well-being of the animals. Stay away, there is nothing worth seeing here."
,,You can skip this if you went to the zoo,3.0,,"We stayed at the regular zoo till it closed at 6, then walked to the Night Safari. We got in line at 6, and were the first people in line, which opened at 7 (even though it says 7:30). There were a ton of people at the night safari - with lots of overpriced restaurants to eat at - honestly, from a money making perspective - its a great plan. Close the zoo, have people with no where to go for an hour, and overpriced food! The night safari was just okay. We did the tram and walking trails - but the nocturnal animals were not really any more active than during the day - and why should they be, it's not like they have to hunt!. We left a little after 9.

So, in one day we did all three zoos - so it is possible - but it made a for a long day! We certainly loved the zoo best, and if you have time for just one - make it the zoo! The other two parks appear to be them capitalizing on the success of the original zoo. The night safari was my least favorite, as I felt the animals still were not doing much, but you could hardly see them."
,,Enjoyable but incredible.,4.0,,The night safari is an enjoyable experience if you are short on time and cannot visit the Singapore during the day. Lines are long and the animals are not the most visible but it is good. The show is good as well however people still felt compelled to use flash photography even after the presenter said not to in at least 7 languages. Not sure if the people doing it were morons or just rude.
,,Average,3.0,,"Very average attraction. the only highlight for me was the tram ride. found that more exciting, pretending that we were in africa for 10 minutes. the show was average, i was more annoyed by the other tourists. we were told to turn off the flash on our cameras and, like the MC staff said, 2 minutes later there were flashes going off like michael jackson was on stage. major fail.
compared to the regular zoo, this pales in comparison. if you have something else you'd like to do, go do that. do this only if you have a night spare. i personally would have preferred to be shopping or enjoying food at one of the many amazing restaurants in singapore."
,,A Night to Remember,4.0,,"Here's the concept: Lots of animals are more active at night than in the day. We go around this zoo in open tram-like transport, and see them doing their thing. We saw lions, tigers, elephants, giraffes, hyenas, buffalo, deer and many more. The trams move slowly or stop at illuminated ""spots"", and there is a commentary. The tram ride lasts for about 40 minutes. You can also take yourself off on one or more of 4 walks where you go at your own pace, and often see different things as well.
Book the tour from your hotel and they will pick you up, and return you. Now the problem! It's very crowded waiting to get on one of the trams and we queued for at least 45 minutes. You could use this time doing the walks and come back when the crowd thins. However, you have to make sure you are finished in time for your bus trip home; the park is out of town. Perhaps don't go on weekends if possible.
The tram ride is a real experience, and one has to do it but we actually enjoyed the walks more.
For those of us who haven't been on a real African Safari, this is a good night out."
,,Singapore night safari,1.0,,Visited night safari with two other families on Saturday 12th July and must have been the busiest day of the year. Arrived at approximately 8pm and I can honestly say it was the longest line I have ever been in. We waited hot and sweaty for almost two hours. During the 45 minute tram ride through the park we got to see a few animals. Lions and some rhinos that where difficult to see and not very active. Nothing that was close to being worth the wait. Having been to other parks I would not recommend this one at all.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,Did the night safari as a tour - the tram ride is great way to see many animals from around Asia. Only got to do one of the walks but this was pretty interesting. Might be better to go alone rather than as a big group and spend late afternoon into the evening. Great place.
,,"Great for all ages, get there early!",5.0,,"Basically, we believe we saw the day zoo, but with a night zoo entrance - it was not clear from their websites! We decided to avoid the tours for this and get there by ourselves so we could take our time and not feel rushed. It was a Saturday night so we were worried it would be very busy. We took one of the cheaper cabs ( red/ white/ blue .. Not the Mercedes) it cost about $ 23 from outside Raffles Hotel (we would have got it even cheaper if we'd flagged the cab down rather than stood in the taxi queue) . We took the cab at around 6pm and arrived 6:30. We purchased the tickets without a queue, grabbed an ice cream ( as we had read bad reviews of the food here) and then joined the already relatively long queue at the entrance at around 6:45. At 6:50 they started to let us in and loaded the trams/ trains. The first train set off at 7:15 and every 5 mins thereafter... the journey takes 40 mins so they have 8 trains. It got dark from 7:25 and we got on the 5th train which left at 7:35 so it was perfect. it is too dark for cameras as no flash is allowed, but videos seem to cope better with the low light and i recommend to take one along. Originally , having read the reviews about long waits for the train, we were going to do the walks first, but the time we arrived, doing the train first was definitely the better option. The queue was much longer after we finished the ride. You do get very close to the animals and it was very enjoyable.

After the ride, we did all the trails ... There are around 4 and we had finished by 9:45 and able to take a taxi home early with no wait. This time the fare was about $20 back to our hotel which was further away at Clarke Quay ( - I have no idea why some reviewers on here paid more, perhaps they got the Mercedes taxis which are more expensive, taxis in Singapore also work on distance not time taken)

We had wondered whether the ride was aimed at small children but it isn't at all, and very enjoyable for all ages including us and our older teens. The trails take you round the rest of the zoo and are very worth doing, you see many more animals as well as those you have seen on the ride close up! The animals were very active and talkative... I have never heard otters talk so much to the keeper who was feeding them fish!"
,,Too good to miss,5.0,,"Highly recommended and a MUST SEE for all ages.
Tour operators tend to rush you, hence try to plan this trip on your own and you will not regret this.
Don't miss the shows: tribal dance (venue: restaurant area) and ""creatures of the night"". Take all the walking trails."
,,Go at night!,5.0,,"Brilliant experience, the night tour is the best. I haven't been to many zoo's but this is more of a safari park, the animals are free to walk along side you and are not visible behind bars or cages, its really and impressive place"
,,Fun experience,4.0,,"We booked the night safari via our hotel and were picked up at the hotel and taken on a larger bus with other people to the zoo. Once we arrived we hopped onto the tram car that takes you around the zoo. This lasts for about 30ish minutes and includes a guided tour. We saw many different animals including elephants, lions, etc. Afterwards we had the option of either watching a couple of shows or walking around independently on the various trails. We choose to walk around and this was interesting as you got to stop at the various enclosures that were of interest to you. After this, we were driven back to our hotel. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants or cafes at the zoo but they were very expensive. I would also recommend getting to the zoo yourself via public bus as this would save you money and would allow you more time to wander the trails without being aware of the time the tour was meeting again. Whilst the night safari was not quite as good as I expected it was still a really enjoyable experience."
,,Absolute Rubbish,1.0,,"I think Shakespeare wrote a play called 'Much Ado About Nothing' - this aptly describes the Night Safari. The tour from the CBD was well organised so no complaints about that. We chose o go on a Saturday night in school holidays and it was like crowds going to a top soccer game! The place was absolutely packed and all the food places outside were doing a roaring trade and charging sky high prices for mediocre rubbish. The queue for the trams was running at about 30-60 minutes wait and it was nigh on impossible to get into one of the shows unless you queued up an hour before. We walked around the zoo instead of using the tram which was fine. However, the animal displays were very disappointing - shadowy shapes in the gloom coming out to eat and most of the animals on display were your common or garden regulars, nothing exotic. It was a complete waste of time and money. Don't get taken in by the hype."
,,So worth the effort,5.0,,"We had heard this was a good attraction but did not expect it to be amazing. We arrived early and had a bite to eat plenty to choose from, we had a problem with our meal taking some time, staff went beyond the call of duty to make sure everything was ok, very helpful resolved quickly. We started the night with the walks, they did not disappoint, it was very warm by the end of the walk. We then jumped on the tram which was an amazing adventure tour of some breath taking animals, they had it all. It is a late night but well worth the effort. We all enjoyed it immensely."
,,Worth a Miss,2.0,,Bought a tour for the night safari with dinner. We were picked up at our hotel at 6.00pm and arrived at the venue at 7.30pm having been shifted between tour buses in China Town. As our seating for dinner finished at 8.30pm we went straight in to eat . Dinner was communal and buffet style. Water and coffee was included but a small can of Tiger beer was S$13.50! A rip off! After dinner we decided not to take the tram ride as the queue went on and on. The two shows - one involving fire eaters?! - were on a first come first served basis so we gave them a miss too. Instead we decided to walk. The paths are well signposted and we saw the majority of the animals. We had to stop at times to let the packed tram pass! Some of the animals were not nocturnal and were asleep. With the queue for the tram still going strong we arrived back at the tour bus as requested at 10.15pm to be told it would take an hour to get back to our hotel. So two and a half hours travel for two hours forty five minutes at the venue! We took a taxi instead and were back at our hotel in less than 20 minutes. The best S$20.20 we have ever spent and less than the cost of two beers at the Night Safari. Unfortunately it would seem that the number of visitors 'on safari' when we went was not limited. But it was a learning experience which we have vowed never to repeat.
,,disappointing,2.0,,"We'd heard the Night Safari was a must-see when in Singapore, so we went along. We lined up for the 'Creatures of the Night' session when we first arrived. Had to wait about half an hour before it started, and it then went for about 30-40 minutes. Saw less than a dozen animals in that time. The compere was entertaining, and the NZ choir in the audience were too, but given the night session only goes for 2-3 hours (depending on arrival and departure time) it was a significant amount of our time at the park.
We then joined a long queue for the tram ride around the park. Waited probably 45 minutes. Once we boarded the tram things got better. By the time the tram ride finished it was time for us to leave, so didn't get to do any of the walks.
For us, there were many better-value things to spend our money on than the Night Safari."
,,Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,3.0,,"While in Singapore for business everyone ranted and raved about the Night Safari. ""You have to do it if you're in Singapore."" Some colleagues and myself went to see what all the hype was about. We were a bit disappointed. It's just the zoo at night. A lot of the enclosures aren't lit up because they don't want to disturb the animals, so it's hard to see a lot of them. The tigers and lions were up so that was cool to see, but it's not worth not being able to see anything else interesting. The best part were the fire breathers out in the ticket/food area, make sure you catch that show."
,,Night time at the Zoo,4.0,,We were picked up from our hotel by a well organised transfer arrived at the zoo with lots of others once again as with all the tours we have done time is limited. We joined a queue with many others which did move relatively quickly the night safari by tram was very good lots to see and great that animals were in open environments only accessible by night tour. We then watched the fire show by two Borneo males who were extremely talented had great seating area after that got drinks and pretty well time to go not enough time to do anything else tours quite restrictive but something worthwhile for families.
,,Underwhelming.,3.0,,"Everyone says the night safari is a must do when visiting. Of course, I booked a night for this activity to see what all the buzz was about. The concept of a night safari is very smart but the range of animals available for observation was quite minimal.

If you go, take the tram around as you'll have a sub-par tour guide narrating throughout the way. You'll probably see about 15 different animals with limited view depending what side of the tram you sit on.

The walking trails are a joke, (of the 4 animals showcased, 1/2 of them are sleeping), but I got great exercise.

The best thing about the night safari is the creatures of the night show. The main character of the show was hilarious and the volunteer opportunities throughout the show made it quite interactive. Definitely the highlight of the night safari!

Overall, decent animal coverage, great creatures of the night show and overpriced food. Worth a night but don't go in with high expectations. Great activity for the kids."
,,Excellent Safari,5.0,,"Well worth doing to see the nocturnal animals come to life. Plenty of activity and the tram ride through the different animal areas is fantastic. Feels like being on safari in the wild.
The food is disappointing and expensive. Drinks are particularly expensive, however it is geared at tourists.
Would definitely do again for the experience of seeing active animals in their natural as possible habitat at night."
,,Over Rated,3.0,,"Picked up by tour bus at 5.15 when we arrived Tour Guide suggested we see the Creatures of the Night Show in an ampitheatre that seated 700 people. Underwhelming, have seen better. When show ended told to line up to get on the Tram Ride along with hundreds of others. Queues were well organised but it seemed to take forever. Ride was a good concept managed to see quite a few animals in the 35 minutes. Did not have enough time to take any of the walking trails.Just time enough to grab some quick take away from a small food outlet and meet our guide outside at 9.40 to be dropped back to our hotel at 11.00pm. Time cut short due to the long wait for Tram Ride.
Would be better suited for young families."
,,Everyone was raving about the night safari,3.0,,Everyone was raving about the night safari so the five of us hopped on one of he buses and headed for the night safari. After getting a ticket we went to line up for the tram that goes around the park. The line wait was a hour and a half. We got to the park at the same time of lightning and a tropical storm. Didn't stop us anyway. I would say the lighting of paths is very dim and it's difficult to see. You can't use flash photography so not to scare the animals which is fare enough. There are plenty of eating places at the park but are a bit on the pricey side. If your on a time restriction I would say do the Singapore zoo instead or the sea aquarium.
,,Dont bother unless its a Friday or Saturday evening ! and then I dont know if it would be worth it!,2.0,,"Really disappointing. The Big Cat feedings, which I was really keen to see only occur Fri and Sat nights!! They don't mention that in any of the reading I did prior to going! I was expecting something a little more intimate however they allowed far too many people in. ""Trains"" used to ferry folk around the park had many hundreds queued right at the entrance...again be prepared to wait for at least an hour if you cant do the walk around! Hubby and I hoofed it for an hour to get half way around the zoo. It was worthwhile in that we saw so much more than you see on the train BUT most animals were too well camouflaged to see, we had expected to see them feeding but there was non of that going on and we were among the first mob there. I have decided I really need a Lazy Lorris though! It was divine ! lol Some western toilets which was lovely and believe me, you cant assume that you will find them everywhere!!!"
,,An excellent experience,5.0,,"We visited last night, and were initially hesitant because a spectacular tropical thunder storm, complete with heavy rain hit the area at around 6pm - just as we were leaving the day zoo. The storm persisted until after 7.30, and the first Creatures of the Night Show was cancelled. We found the crowds around the entry quite overwhelming- being a Friday night and very wet, it was hectic there. The lines for the trams were ridiculously long, and a couple of my family members wanted to leave....BUT, we're so happy we stayed.
We decided to rent a locker and dump our belongings ($3 rental for a large locker). A word of advice: the lockers are located at the reception area which is outside the park...so do this on the way in. We then went and bought ponchos at the gift shop ($5 each - so try to remember to pack your own!). Then we bypassed the tram queues and headed off on the walk trails. The rain had settled into a light drizzle, but being Singapore it was still warm. The walk trails wind through the vegetation and animal enclosures, and it was quite spectacular.
We saw so many animals - all out and active. I dont think that there was a single enclosure in the whole safari where we didn't see the animal/s. We stopped halfway around to buy drinks at the zebra cafe, and to strip off our ponchos, before getting back to the entry in time for the 9.30 Creatures of the Night show- which was very entertaining. Following the show, we got straight into a tram ...which wasn't even 1/3 full at that time of night. The tram ride was fantastic! We saw every animal, and were blown away by having to stop as deer and Tapirs crossed in front of us...a tapir passed within a metre of where we were sitting in the back carriage.
What an amazing place! The only criticism would be that the drinks were more expensive than the day zoo, and that the souvenirs are ridiculously overpriced. If its a unique animal experience you're after though...this is the place....and don't be deterred if it's raining."
,,Outstanding Time!,4.0,,"Traveling by yourself is no fun - business class or not. What can you do with a 13 hour layover? Well, if you are in Singapore - quite a bit. So if I must go somewhere it's more fun to see or meet someone. If I can't do that, at least do something unique.

Visiting the Singapore Zoo at night definitely qualifies as something unique. There is something magical about visiting a place during the night. Certainly the noctural animals make it worthwhile.

I know zoos aren't for everyone. Be open to the experience. Don't expect too much. You may find some interesting gems in the dark."
,,Brilliant Attraction but Oh the Crowds!!,4.0,,"We went during School holidays and on a Saturday night - don't!!! We arrived in time for the fire eaters who were very good but ate at the Bongo Burger restaurant which was by far the worst food we have had in Singapore, the Ulu Ulu restaurant looked much better but you couldnt see the show.
I don't think we could have picked a busier time to go but the queue to get in cleared very quickly only to be replaced by a very long slow moving queue for the bus. We opted to do the walking trails which were fantastic and picked up the bus at the East Lodge. The problem was when we got back to the main lodge the queue for the bus was even longer than it had been two hours earlier! We were hot and tired so we decided not to do the first half of the bus ride which was a shame. More transport is definitely required of busy times."
,,"fun experience, but animals were too far away",3.0,,"no regrets on going to see this place, but it was dark and all the animals were so far away. They were all up and in well lit areas though. I guess I was expecting some closer encounters."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"This is a must do! Expensive, but a very unique adventure for the whole family. See animals up close that are ""not trained or restrained."""
,,An oldie but a goodie,5.0,,Love the Night Safari. Arrived early so our younger children could eat and watch fire show and then got on one of the earliest trains and kids just about able to stay awake until the end! Always good value and so many interesting animals. Be sure to get off the train to walk around! We especially love the bat enclosure!
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"I was on business but on last evening our hosts took us for dinner and then here for a glimpse of something very unusual. Not what I expected, thoroughly enjoyed the way the park is set up. Convenient and you can take as long as you want or go through the park relatively quickly if you wish."
,,Exceptional and Outstanding,5.0,,"Went there on the same day we landed in Singapore. I was a bit cautious at first as I thought its jst another zoo. But I was proved wrong at the entrance itself with a spellbound jungle
performance followed by an unforgettable tour. Seeing wildlife without an enclouser was topped with my encounter with big bats face to face.
Overall an outstanding and exciting experience. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!"
,,Very overrated.,3.0,,"I heard so much goody goody reviews about it,so with our teenage kids and one small child visited. At the end of the safari my conclusion was it is very very over rated. Lighting was so dim you cant see properly. One lion seems to me Fake.Really fake.after every two three animals you see some kind of Deer. At the end of the journey their was a show but they told us that you cant see that bcz its Full.if they charged us then they should let us watch.All in all i will rate it 5/10.Food area had nothing special to talk about."
,,The night zoo is a must see in Singapore,5.0,,"We only had time to go to the Night Safari but it was well worth it. Since so many animals are nocturnal, most of the time during the day they are just sleeping. At night, animals like tigers, otters and hyenas were far more active than I have seen them at any other zoo. The subtle lighting used was more than good enough to see the animals clearly and the moat-based security allowed us to get really close up. I loved this location"
,,a must for animals lover!,4.0,,"The place is not accessible via MRT but there are other options that can get you there. SAEX provides shuttle services to some designated pick up points. Goto their website for details. Alternatively you could take the local bus from Ang Mo Kio or Chua Chu Kang MRT stations.
Plan you visit wisely as the Night Safari open it's door at 7pm. We were there on a weekday and there is a very long queue at the tram ride! So go ahead and watch the shows and walk through the paths to see the animals in the park.
FYI, there is a tram stop in the middle / center of the walk path. Should you be too tired to walk, hop in to the tram and they will get you back to the tram station near the entrance.
The trams brings you to some path which is not accessible via foot."
,,Beautifully thought out,5.0,,"Like everything the Singaporeans do, they do it very well. This was a lovely way to see the animals in a relaxed environment. Going at night was also a lot more pleasant than having to deal with the daytime heat. The animals were gorgeous and appeared quite relaxed. Don't do the dinner tours, save time by eating at one of the little food stalls and then going on a self-guided walk after you have done the safari."
,,Children's may enjoy more in night safari.....,3.0,,Night Safari was good....in night safari you sit in open tram type bus....and go into man made jungle where on both sides of road there are animals almost many animals from lion to elephant to rhino to tigers to zebra........i think children might enjoy there more......
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"So much fun and so different to other zoos and animal parks. Make sure to do the safari tour as well as the walking trails. You will see lots more animals.
The burgers out the front were okay as far as food and there's a Ben n Jerry's for ice cream.
We visited in July which is low season so there were no queues or waits for anything. Consider getting there as soon as it opens and get straight on the safari."
,,Experience of a lifetime,4.0,,"The night safari is a treat to watch. There is a Thumbakar show which is a treat to the eyes. The tram ride and the creatures of the night show are also very good.
When I was collecting my tickets there were other tourists who found it costly. But I had booked it through my I venture card and hence was not that costly."
,,"Excellent, if expensive, visit",4.0,,"Really enjoyed our trip to the Night Safari. The queue for the train was long, but moved fairly efficiently and was worth the wait for the 40 minute tour. The animal show (about 20 minutes or so) was also good, but get there at least 15 minutes early for a seat. The tour group we went with took almost 2 hours to get us there via various hotel stops, though the commentary was good, but it was way too far for a taxi. We ran out of time to do any walking paths before we needed to board the bus for the long trip back to the hotel. Perhaps public transport would have been a better option.

Food at the zoo is very expensive. We opted for a couple of serves of chips which were cold and tasteless and cost $5 each, and a few Korean deep-fried ""things, which were no better or cheaper. Photos were ridiculously expensive at $25 each, so didn't bother.

All in all, worth a visit, but I'd do it a little differently based on my experience."
,,Rubbish. Complete waste of time.,1.0,,"I try to take the best out of everything, but when you are on holiday and have spent a considerable about of money and time is of the essence I would say avoid this totally.
I can't say how disappointed I was with this attraction after going there last night with my two boys aged 7 & 16.
We booked the Night Safari experience with evening meal and were taken to a large dining room for the evening meal which was OK. Similar to any theme park style buffet. Limited choices and a long queue but pretty much what I expected so we enjoyed this part fine.
The entry to the Safari is made up of basically a shopping complex of tourist shops and souvenirs and a huge range of restaurants. This was the only part of the tour where they see end to have any care about catering to the huge crowds.
After dinner we headed to the Safari ""proper"". Basically we then spent the next 90 minutes in a queue. Firstly just to get through the gate which was closed as the queues inside the park were too long then in the queue for the tram ride.
We tried to see either of the shows both of which were full and were turned away.
So we sucked it up and waited, and waited in the queue.
Once we got to the tram ride it was ok. My 7 year old thought it was good but from my perspective it was incredibly rushed.
At one stage we stopped at a tram stop inside the park where you could go on some sort of walking trail. We decided not to as there was about 200 people at the stop looking like they had been marooned there for days. Unless someone gets off, they cannot get on (and get back to the starting point). We could hear these poor people complaining to the staff and they really looked like they had been there ages. A little later we heard a cheer go up from the station, my husband said he thought they had started sending golf carts to rescue the hapless ""guests"".

So. If you think spending 5 hours in queues, and coaches to do a 30 minute tram ride, where you speed past a few zoo animals in the dark so you can hardly see them anyway, then I guess this is for you.

I should say we are seasoned theme park attendants, and have been to universal studios, Disneyland, lego land many times. The queue here and the overall experience was much worse.

If you are lucky enough to go to Bali the Bali Safi is about a million times better."
,,Wow- first experience,5.0,,"Had first experience in ""zoo"" type night safari. It has eating joints and tribal dances at entrance.
The major trail is covered by trams. Internal trains are covered by walking and be prepared to walk a lot. Take fluids with you and if have kids, take strollers. The internal trails are worth exploring for close encounters with nocturnal jungle life.
You see a lot of volunteers around who are ready to help you. This is in premises of singapore zoo so better club them together. Spend atleast 3 hours to cover it all nicely. Private buses and taxis to city are available from the gate as late as 12 in Night.
Enjoyed"
,,Enjoyed a lot,4.0,,"Went with family- toddler kid. Stroller is absolutely must. Animals- well maintained, close encounters allowed, show timings well spaced out, kids enjoy personal encounters with animals, see them eat, see them play. Lot of variety. Have trams running inside but still needs a lot of walking if you want to enjoy. Worth the visit for sure.
Reaching there is easy through buses/taxis. They have private bus stations from where you can take buses to city as late as 12 AM in night. No need to prebook taxis always.

As this place is far from city better to club with night safari or river safari, as all 3 of these are in same campus.
I had some problem getting vegetarian food there, though chips and icecreams could be bought. Carry fluids as Singapore is hot and humid and to buy fluids inside zoo carry some change of 2 dollars.
We clubbed this with night safari and had a memorable day.
A must visit in Singapore"
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,"We visited the Zoo, River Safari and Night safari all in one day as it is a little out of the main part of Singapore, a cab will cost around $24 and takes about 30 mins depending on traffic. We arrived at the zoo around 10.30 am and the line up for tickets was long, I suggest you purchase tickets online before you go, that way you get straight in. The zoo was excellent, we chose to do all the walking trails first then we hopped onto the tram. You see a lot more on the walking trails than on the 10 min tram ride. You get up close to all kinds of animals especially the monkeys, we had a little one following us around, great photo opportunities. It took us a few hours to complete all the trail as we like to take a lot of photos so the tram ride at the end was a welcome rest. After the zoo we walked over to the river safari, this was not as good as the zoo but you do get to see some panda bears and it only takes around an hour or two to complete the river safari. We had to wait until 6.45 for the night safari to open but the shops and food stalls open at around 5.30 so we headed on over and grabbed some dinner. The line was extremely long so start lining up around 6.30, once we were in we thought we would start on the walking trail first and by the time we got back we thought the crowd would have thinned for the tram ride. How wrong we were, by the time we finished walking it was around 1-2hrs later and the line for the tram ride was miles long, we waited in line for at least 1/2 hr so do the tram ride first if you go to avoid waiting so long. The tram ride goes for around 40 mins and you get to see a lot more on the ride than you do while walking. It was a great experience and after a long day in the heat it was quite relaxing riding around the park seeing all the animals by moonlight. You should definitely do this on your trip to Singapore, it is a unique and enjoyable experience. ."
,,WOW,4.0,,"A different kind of Zoo. the tram ride covers most of the parts.The settings were made for animals blend with the environment. It was an interesting ride to see many animals close by and unharming. Picture taking opportunities are less since the tram doesn't stop anywhere. The fishing cat trail and wallaby trail can be used for walk and that provides good photo taking opportunities. This attraction is too crowded that you have to pass a big queue to get the tram ride. Suggest finishing the same first and then to the walking trail. Later evening, their is the thumbakar performance by fire eaters. due to time constraints, i wasn't able to see the animal show."
,,Great experience specially show,5.0,,Great place. Just go there around 7 pm and go for the show first then go for the trams. Amazing place but remember it is just another zoo built in a good way and good trip. A different experience to visit zoo is in night. You can explore the zoo by trekking also in night. Good place to for specially with kids
,,Embraced by the Wildlife,5.0,,"A dreaming opportunity for me and my family to get away from the busy city life. I haven't been thought of such kind of experience to be so close to the animals, even by inches. The variety of animals that I can find is unexpected. This is really a good education for kids. They can find out what is a tiger really looked like and not just pictures from the books. For me as an adult, it is amazing to find a number of sparkling eyes staring at me when I am strolling around. A fabulous tour!!"
,,A Must Visit,4.0,,"I am glad we chose to visit the safari. It was a very different experience. I am glad we reached there at 6.30pm although the show began at 7. It is a treat to see the animals in their night environment without their cages.

The Thumbuakar performance was pretty good.

For a little more about my Night Safari experience, here is the link: http://nehaslife.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/singapore-thailand-trip-the-singapore-night-safari/"
,,A Very Different Zoo Experience,4.0,,"What a lovely way to beat the heat!

Suggest you get there early. It opens at 7:30 but I suggest you grab dinner there before opening time. It's set up for a night experience with several buffet style options and a bar. We got there at around 8 pm and the queue was really long.

You basically hop on a tram that takes you around the zoo trail and have the option of a few walking trails as well. There's also a night safari show.

The air was cool and the commentary on the tram was interesting. We missed the last show by the time we came back from the team, another reason to get there early.

The only down side is you can be unlucky and get some animals that are hidden, hard to see or inactive.

It's something different."
,,amazing experience for kids,5.0,,"after the singapore zoo we went for the night safari , we were 6 adults and 6 kids all below 10 years of age..
they really loved the view of animals at night ..perfect from kids to see the wildlife from a safe distance with any cages ..
we were surprised to see animals from such a close distance .
amazing experience..
a word of caution. since singapore restaurants close by 10 pm mostly and if you are a vegetarian indian looking for roti and dal for kids night safari food court has one counter for indian food which is really below average.so better if you cud carry some food with you."
,,"Good entertainment for family, love the fire dance.",5.0,,"As we used to see the zoo on the day light, this night safari is a really different and exciting experience. Love the sound of the nature at night, the silence and the ambiance. They have fire dance which really is amazing!! A must see when you are in Singapore... Suitable for older children as we are not allowed to make too much noise when doing the safari, small children might a bit terrified by the dark and the silence. Aside the safari ride, you also can explore by walking the safari trail to get more feeling of the night jungle and hop in the rides at any available stops.
This facility located a bit far and only reachable by taxi. Make sure you get out just before the show is over to avoid taxi queue"
,,Worth it... So don't miss out...,4.0,,"My friends and I were at Marina Bay Sands before heading to Night Safari. We decided to take the Public Transport. So we took MRT down to Ang Mo Kio, where we grab our dinner there. There's too many people in the group, so it was difficult to gather together. We initially wanted to use bus, but we were too late, so we took taxi. It took about $10 - $20 roughly. I would prefer if there's a better transportation available. The first thing you'll realize when you get there, take picutres with the people who wear costumes of animals. They are really great & fun~ Felt superb welcome. Then we took the tram at the inside of the Night Safari, great guides and it's fantastic.. Some of the animals, I have not seen them in real life before, but in Lion King. hehe. It's really really cool. Walking around is great too. There are shows too. We were lucky that we didn't miss that out. So, enjoy~ Buy tickets prior going to the spot will save you some money. I bought it either from the internet, (the groupon) or from the backpackers I stayed in."
,,Fantastic adventure,5.0,,"With the choice of 2 different trails and a tram ride (we took them all of course), the night safari is a full-blown jungle adventure experience. It is truly mesmerizing just walking through jungle paths when it's dark and all the different noises surround you. If you went to the zoo at day time, this is a totally different ride, especially when some of the animals are night-active."
,,What an experience.,5.0,,"This park is set out so well, Firstly there is the entrance plaza where animal shows,human torches performing incredible fire-eating stunts and also you can have your photo taken with some animals.Lots of different food stalls and cafes to stop the hunger pains. The safari adventurer tour is a must, a great ride through the park.
There are four walking trails,Fishing Cat, Leopard, Wallaby and East Lodge and along each of these you encounter all the animals in there natural setting.. The gift shop has a huge range of great fun gifts for all ages.Restaurants and retail shops open from 5.30pm. and the park area from 7.30 - 12.00 pm and all this time is full of so many things to see and do. The park is well laid out and signage is easy to follow, guides are around to help out if needed.
I wanted to hide in the bushes and jump out at the next people coming down the path but my niece would not let me. Great Fun......"
,,Different way to see a zoo,4.0,,"The night safari is a visit through the Singapore Zoo at night, it was very interesting to see the animals at night and I would recommend visiting."
,,Great Night Out,5.0,,"Excellent experience.
You can walk the area - well signed or you can take the ""train"" which travels around the park and stops at all the animals. You can do both - ride as an overview then walk which gives you a complete view of the zoo.
It views the night animals when they are out and about. You can watch the keepers feeding the animals.
Plenty of taxis to get you back to your accommodation when you have finished."
,,Brilliant attraction for adults and children,5.0,,"I went to the night safari 6 years ago and was determined to take my husband,daughter and grand daughter to visit on this trip to Singapore.

it is an amazing way to see so many animals in such a short period of time while travelling on the train round the circuit, Because the spotlights come on the animals as and when you go round then even little childten (my granddaughter was 15 months old) enjoyed the experience)

Would prefer to be able to get alternative food earlier in the evening and not wait until the end of the train journey to experience all the differnt types of food to buy which is the only drawback as it was then too late with a baby to stay and eat. We queued for the beefburgers before we went in but certainly didn't enjoy what we had purchased, so that was very disapointing.."
,,Worth exploring!,4.0,,"I went there by a cab from Bugis, it cost me a bomb! Didn't know there's 25% peak hour surcharge... :( you may want to consider other options like MRT & bus. You can get the traveling directions easily from the free brochures in the airport. They are pretty useful.

The entrance fees cost SGD 28, but I got 10% off by showing Tiger Airways boarding pass! =)

It is recommended to complete the walking trail first before taking the train. This can save some queuing time as most people will queue up for the train ride first.

I enjoyed the walking trail very much. Seen lots of baby animals. They are just adorable!! However, some of the animals were hidden and not easily be seen. So, it's depends on whether you are lucky.

There's also a short animal show, about 20mins long. Checkout the showing time and get there earlier to grab a better seat. Or else, you gonna sit at the corner.

Bottomline, I think it's worth to give it a try on your next trip. It's something different from the ordinary zoo. =)"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"A last minute decision to visit the night safari was well worthwhile. Our expectations weren't high, but we were surprised. Really well organised, great causal atmosphere for such a busy city, and a chance to get up close with some big creatures at night. If you get a chance, jump off the bus and take a walk through the paths. Well worthwhile!"
,,a unique experience of night safari,5.0,,"book private tour as in shared tour guide not accompany you so you may face lot of problems .
even you can come directly to site by public transport and tickets available at site and just follow major bulk of public to destination. to attend night safari show was main key feature of visit.it was breath holding event for me. it was amazing for me to watch animals having active live during night and their different kinds of performances guided by trainer who was doing commentary simultaneously in English."
,,Fantastic experience!,4.0,,"The Night Safari (part of the Singapore Zoo) is a fantastic attraction. We went on our final night, and took a shuttle bus from our hotel. After walking with skepticism into a very tourist looking courtyard area, we proceeded to line up. The tour buses came quickly and we didn’t have to wait long before we were on the trail. It was simply spectacular to see hyenas, tigers, rhinos and zebras at night. The bus was open allowing for full views to either side to witness the creatures who were at times a little too close for comfort! This was all part of the adventure as we journeyed through the eerily quiet rainforest for a good 20-30 minutes. Although it seemed to finish too quickly, I soon started to realize just how much I’d seen… I’d say at least 25 different animals. The tour guide provided us with details on every animal, and I was pleasantly surprised by the expanse of the enclosure that allowed each group to freely roam about. The Night Safari is definitely worth a visit."
,,night safari,4.0,,"Our package deal included a buffet dinner and then a train ride through the dark zoo, followed by a show. It was a great experience, just felt a little sorry that the animals were floodlit. I wondered when they would get to relax. Awesome though"
,,Cool,4.0,,"It's a very interesting place, no matter if you're a kid or not. It's quite far from the city, about 1 hour going from MBS by taxi, around 300sgd. there're many interesting things to do at Night Safari, not just visiting the zoo. we had a delicious dinner before starting the tour around the safari. the animals, surely fascinating to watch ;) i would have attended another show but it was kinda late and we have to go back to the city. the return trip was much cheaper by bus, only around 9 or 10sgd? (or 3? i dont remember exactly) but it was a very nice experience, you should try it at least once when visiting SG :)"
,,diferrent,3.0,,do not have too much imagination as this safari is in night and you see the animals with the help of lights. we have not enjoyed much during our visit as weather does not co-operates due to rainy as well as clody.
,,Singapore zoo by night,5.0,,We purchased an organised tour of the zoo by night. Don't do it. Just get a shuttle out to the zoo and look around on your own. Our tour included dinner and a ride on the tram through the park. We still had to queue even though we had prepurchased tickets so spent most of our night in a queue. hardly saw the animals or the extra show. However it is well worth going to the zoo at night as it is quite special. Just do it yourself!
,,Great if there weren't so many people,4.0,,"Missed the animal show at the beginning, but were told if we do the Tram tour we would be back in time for the last Show. Some time while we were on the Tram they cancelled the last Show & we were both disappointed & angry we missed it."
,,Good for a Zoo. Great Night Tour.,5.0,,"I'm not too big on zoos. And of course this zoo has the pitfalls of every other zoo, small enclosures. Now that being said many of the enclosures were a good size, and all of them were very well kept.

I was severely disappoint that they perform elephant shows. Especially from an establishment that prides themselves in treating animals well. We all know what elephants go through to get to the point of performing.

The open style environment for the Orangutans was very cool! Same with the walk-in enclosure for the Lemurs.

The night tour was great fun! I highly suggest you spend the extra money and tour around the night exhibits. We got to see some animals that normally are sleeping during the day."
,,Night Safari!,4.0,,"The night safari is awesome. There is a train that takes visitors to various stops where you can get out and walk through the exhibits seeing animals that come out more at night. Low lights don't disturb the animals, but give visitors enough visibility to see. The best was the flying squirrel cage. They look like flying carpets in the air, then shrink to the size of a small mammal on the ground. You'd never see things like this in a regular zoo. Just expect it to be crowded with long lines to get in as it's deservedly very popular. Also, even at night, it's very warm and humid, so dress appropriately."
,,Best place for kids in singapore,5.0,,"Your kids will love this. Excellent animal shows. super night safari experience. Great restaurants, easy trails. Prams are great."
,,An adventurous ride followed by an enthralling animal show,4.0,,"The night safari was our first sight-seeing in Singapore. We first took the tram ride where we passed through very well maintained and beautiful jungle. It was altogether a nice experience to see the animals not tied in cages but in their natural habitat. However, they should introduce more variety of animals. The tram had live commentary though I feel the volume should be a little louder as we had a little difficulty hearing our guide since we were seated at the back and also because of a group of noisy irritating couples seated with next to us. Anyhow, it was a fun ride in the dark. There were also several jungle trails that one can take. Since we did not want to miss the animal show, we opted out of it. Creatures of the Night was the show stealer. The show was very engaging and also few good messages for the masses. We later had dinner in their food court, some Indian restaurant.. I can’t recall the name. The food was good quality and value for money. I particularly loved their washroom – having the jungle feel!!!"
,,Incredible Experience,5.0,,Absolutely loved this place. We paid a little bit extra to get a private buggy tour but was definitely worth it. You probably want to go on a week night rather than a weekend as it gets super busy. Not sure if you would get the same experience if you walked around by yourself or took the general train ride. No photos as you couldn't use the flash. Food was not overly priced for an entertainment park you have to try the coconut juice.
,,Night Safari a great experience,5.0,,We loved the night safari. We hated the queues (I guess we waited for nearly an hour to board the tram) but it was worth the wait. The drive through the park took around 40 minutes and we saw most of the animals. The gift shops were expensive but we managed to find a few souvenirs. Definitely recommended.
,,Something different & fun!,5.0,,My hubby and I recently spent 5 nights in Singapore and saved the night safari as our last night. We were excited to go and had heard great things about it. It's safe to say we were not disappointed! Such a great night!! The variety of animals and also the open planning with their enclosures gave you the feeling of being so close to them. I would definitely recommend this attraction!
,,Interesting night out,4.0,,"A Night Safari is practical to schedule in Singapore because sunset is at about 7pm every night. The safari is in an area adjacent to the Singapore zoo, and the animals are different. It is dark so it is not possible too see too much, even with lighting. The variety of animals is quite limited compared to those in the main Singapore zoo. Walkways run alongside the exhibits, but most people take the trams (with narration) that drive throughout the park. The food served at the safari is not good, in my opinion.

Visiting a zoo at night is rare, hence the popularity of the Night Safari. Also it is good to get away from the congestion of most of Singapore. You only need to see this once. The Night Safari is popular with jet-lagged tourists to Singapore, who are wide awake in the evening and want something unique to do."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Great experience seeing the animals at night. Don't queue to get on the tram first instead do the walking trails and get on the tram later when there's no queue. Try and arrive early as it's hard to back back to the city after 10.30/11pm. We got there at 8.30 and still hadn't seen everything by 10.30. We took the mrt then bus 138 which took a while from the city (1 hour). Taxi back to Clarke quay cost $35
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"Zoo is very well run and set out but at lease 80% of the animal were asleep or not visible.
Had never been to a night zoo / safari so wasn't sure what to expect, but all in all I did want to see some animals and not just deer."
,,don't wait for the tram,4.0,,"howdy, our party of 9 went in June 2014 we ranged from 10 to 59 in age and we loved the experience. after reading on here about others experiences we didn't wait for the tram but headed down to the show to the right of where the trams are. This show shouldn't be missed the animals are wonderful, the otters come out and sort through the rubbish and put it in the right rubbish bin. Other wonderful things but don't wish to give away the surprise. We went from there back passed the trams as the line up was still over 20 minutes and we walked the trails. Not only was it not crowded with people it was early and animals still out and active. We later when we were finished did the tram and didn't have to wait at all and the tram wasn't packed therefore we all got window seats.

well worth a visit. but personally I wouldn't wait for the tram!"
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Even though the zoo was small, the safari was very exiting.... The travel in dark was amazing. I went in peak season, so it was crowded with people.... But the animals was totally inactive which I did not like...."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"It was an unique experience. You travel through a tram, one side you face the deer and the other side there is a Lion. It was an memorable experience."
,,I would never go there again,1.0,,"I can not tell what I saw there because there was nothing to see (probably because it was a night visit). First of all, the queues are so so immense that I wanted to quit immediately. Then, after an hour and a half of queueing, we were put on a train which took us through the dark for another hour. And that was it. You can smell more than see the animals which are mostly hidden somewhere and not visible at night. After the tour was done, my friend and I wanted to have a snack, oh how wrong of us to be hungry there! I have had the worst hamburger ever (or whatever it was) at the restaurant at the entrance (some bar made to seem American). Very complicated to get to the zoo, too. Metro+bus (cca 45 min)."
,,Not a typical zoo,4.0,,"Well, honestly the best part of it is the Night Safari. You walk along the paths or ride on an electric tram and watch wild (how wild are they really, one wonders?) animals live just metres away from you! Unbelievable! When a tiger walked by and tapped his tail against the glass in front of my nose during Leopard Trail, I felt shivers! You will never be closer to those creatures, great and small!"
,,So much fun,4.0,,We really enjoyed the night zoo. We went early and decided to go at our own pace. We could have easily stayed for anothe few hours after closing. The train was worth riding between the major stops so see all the animals.
,,Wow,5.0,,All I can say is WOW to this zoo. The night safari was unbelievable and something to see. You were very close to the animals with no cages it was surreal. Loved it.
,,"Magical, moonlit moments that you have to work for",4.0,,"Some comments below say that the animals are hard to see or encounter.

Bear in mind that these are wild animals, and not stage performers. They haven't been preparing all their lives to see you - yes, you - and so do not be offended if they are nowhere to be seen in their enclosures. They are entitled to be out of your line of sight, in a hidden corner of a cage, etc. You have to take your chances.

Having said that, my visit yielded an encounter with a tiger from six inches away (through glass), a happily munching tapir from about three feet away, a great view of some hyenas who looked at us ravenously, a truly epic elephant who made some friendly noises as we went past, and several more.

How to approach it?

Be patient and take your time.

Do NOT rush to the trams as soon as the park opens at 7.00pm. Everyone does this, and if it's a weekend you will be caught in a frenzied stampede.

Instead, hit the walking trails first. Like I say, patience pays. Standing in front of an enclosure for a couple of minutes may allow you to spot a very still ""rock"" that moves slightly and becomes an animal! To see animals in moonlight is indeed a very different, almost magical experience, and one worth having.

There are four themed ""trails"", that are clearly laid out on the maps they give you. It's a brisk walk for each, but the heat of the day is over so it's actually quite fun to walk around in semi-darkness with a cool breeze from time to time.

Do the tram ride LAST, after you've done your walks. To explain, you'll see some of the ""walk"" animals again, but from a different angle, but you will also see some new ones not covered in the trail routes. The tram ride is a good “unwind” and lets you catch your breath again.

Food & beverage options are numerous, and a little pricey (as expected.) Staff are dotted all over the park, and are helpful. If you lose your way, just ask.

There are two side attractions: one is a Creatures Of The Night show that your kids will love, and one a slightly gimmicky fire-eating act at the entrance.

They will tell you repeatedly ""no flash photography"", and you will still see flashes all over.

Can you really blame the animals for hiding sometimes?"
,,"Fun, but hard to see animals",3.0,,"I was very excited for the night safari, but slightly disappointed it was so difficult to see anything, and forget about taking photos, it's impossible (you can't use flash). It's a fun experience, with exotic animals, and very well done, it might be more exciting to do a real safari, or just visit visit the zoo."
,,must do!,5.0,,"You have to come here. I can't recommend this enough.
The tram ride is a bit of a wait to get on, but the 45mins trail ride through is great....
Don't come here on a tour, as you won't have enough time, so just make your way over... leaving you plenty of time to do the walking trails... and see some of the shows."
,,Good but not great,3.0,,"An interesting take on the standard zoo experience. Singapore Zoo does a great job at putting you in the action - few of the animals have actual glass barriers or fences, and there are some cool up close encounters. That said, it's a night visit, and even with artificial lighting, visibility is fairly poor. Many of the animals are adept at hiding in their environments and it was hard to observe those who chose to stay hidden (duh). Tram ride was engaging but the best part is to just do the walking trails yourself. Fairly expensive as well (about 35 Singapore dollars)."
,,waste of $160,1.0,,"The advertised 40 min tram tour was only 25 minutes. We caught the second tram leaving the yard, so we weren't late, around 7:30pm.

Granted, it is night and most animals were not active, but don't charge us $70 each! We chose to pay $20 for a taxi there, rather than book a tour - a good decision! And when we were leaving a bus was handy - we caught bus/train home (a great decision since we had a 3 day public transport pass).

We got a discount on our entry ticket for showing our Singapore Airlines ticket - a positive

Even though it is hotter during the day, I recommend a day tour!

I would never recommend this night tour to anyone!"
,,Overrated and Over Priced,1.0,,"This place obliviously has nothing to compete against, the animal enclosure take you back about 20 years, Melbourne Zoo absolutely blows this place off the map for eco friendly and enviro friendly attitudes to animals.
The River Safari, don't waste your money, a cheap imitation of a Wild Life experience, prophetic excuse for entertainment. 15 minutes of worst experience you could imagine.
Night Safari, give me break they had to wake the animals up to animate them,I seen people go to jail for less, in conning money out of punters.
Don't , I mean don't go, to this place, it obvious that the Singapore govt needs to keep their population distracted from the reality of living in Singapore, with overpriced pathetic exhibits, taking what little money they have.."
,,Not great,3.0,,Difficulty getting back into town. Bus stop queue was a free for all. Shame the safari has to be at night; animals were pretty hard for children to make out.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,The Night Safari was the only attraction we saw at Singapore Zoo but it was by far the best Zoo experience! We also really wanted to do the River Safari but it hadn't yet opened. It was not ideal for photographs (you can't use flash and it's dark) but the animals are just right there and the MC guides were excellent.
,,Dont get excited,3.0,,"We had read the night safari was a must do in Singapore. We were disappointed. Long queues for the tram to go around the zoo. The animals were not very active. Some couldn't be seen at all. The only benefit to doing the night safari against doing the tour in the day is avoiding the heat and humidity.
We also stayed to see the ""show"". Was ok. Nothing special."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Superb organized, the night safari is probably a must see in Singapore.

It is so impressing, how close you get to these wonderful animals. Make sure you arrive at 7 pm and go straight to the Tram station if you don't wanna queue.

Could be a good introduction for the first day/night in Singapore."
,,Different experience,4.0,,"Very commercial with all the restaurants and touristy shops. Tram ride interesting but a lot of animals hard to see in the dark. We watched the animals performing at the show afterwards which was well done, and then it was a rush to get a taxi back to the city as everyone seemed to be leaving at the same time. Would need two visits to have time to walk the trails as well."
,,Unusual experience....worth visiting.,4.0,,"A very unusual , positive experience to see animals at night in an artificially created yet superb environment. A treat for both adults and kids. It's a must visit for anyone going to Singapore. We were there about 2 years ago, and will go again when in Singapore next time !!"
,,Love the Night Safari!,5.0,,"When you live the city, there are buses to go directly to this, as it is quite far from Orchard. I think it's around $20+/person, if I'm not wrong.

We find one of the animal show very entertaining! The staff is very good at engaging everybody, and the animals. haha..
You can also ride the buggy around instead of walking, and it's an enjoyable ride where the staff will tell you some facts/stories about the animals.
If you love animals, it's definitely worth to go.

We really love the experience and will definitely be back to watch other animal shows."
,,A must visit in singapore,5.0,,We went there around 5.30 pm....and the place is amazing....good shows and tramp ride was awesome....the setting of the jungles and animals there habitat was mind blowing...They have actually made this safari out of a real jungle....jungle walk is a must......this place is a must visit in singapore
,,Night safari,3.0,,"A disappointing 'show' at the beginning. We have seen -and expected- far better, but the actual ride was interesting. Although pouring with rain, it was an interesting visit."
,,night safari,4.0,,Getting up close to animals is always an experience to cherish .Would have liked more time here as there are walking trails to follow and hardly enough time to see everything.If you arrange the night safari as a tour please be aware that you will not have enough time to see the shows as well as walk the trails
,,So so... not great,3.0,,"The night safari trail takes you through the artificial created zones showcasing the flora and fauna of different regions. The down side of this tour is that it’s too crowded and it’s a task battling the crowd and getting into the bogies. The trail again is dark and animals aren't visible too clearly.
The bogies are equipped with automated narration which is pretty good explaining the regions. The ride overall is a pleasant one but in comparison to the Singapore zoo it’s not great as such.
Post the ride you get to see the tribal fire dance which is nice and lasts for some 10 mins.
Note that you cannot use cameras with flash as it disturbs the animals."
,,"Singapore night zoo - if you do one thing in Singapore, do this.",5.0,,"I booked and went on a night tour, it was amazing. The animals act so differently in the dark and walking around the zoo was like being lost in an amazing rainforest. Highly recommend, if you do one thing in Singapore, do this."
,,Not the same anymore,3.0,,"The whole experience was kinda disappointing. We went in early to beat the crowds and got our tickets. We got in the tram and went around for the 40 min ride. Quite a few animals were not to be seen. Also most animals shown were of the deer family. Only the rhino, hippo and elephant created some buzz. Rest were the usual ones.

We then saw two shows. One was the Thumbukar show(fire show), which was good with some interesting fire stunts.
But the biggest disappointment was the "" Creatures of the night Show"". After 30 mins of waiting for the show, the show in itself was just over 10 mins with nothing interesting. Give a hard thought before visiting this place."
,,Nature was nice...but was tiring and sweaty,4.0,,"Night safari was okay, but had many problems. First big problem was the mosquitoes! Too many of them at night because it was really dark, so bring mosquito repellent. Secondly, the coach tour that brings you around the zoo was not hugely worth it, because you couldn't see much. If you're just there to experience, then it's okay but picture taking is really hard in the low visibility. Food was okay, but slightly pricey. Loved the safari atmosphere and the shops though. The trails were good, but long and we became tired quickly.

Overall, okay if you're in for the experience, but don't expect to snapshot much."
,,Go Safari!!!,5.0,,No camera with flashes is the only thing which disappoints you here as you may not get clear pictures of animals if you go for a night safari. It was a beautiful experience for as as we were going for something like that for the first time in our life. You will be taken in a tram through different spots where you can find so many wild animals near you. Initially we were a bit scared as my wife was carrying. But we found that there is a small net sort of thing which separates you from animals. We would love to visit this place again. How ever we bought few souvenirs for that beautiful experience.
,,crowded and fairly average,3.0,,"Booked with a coach tour.A faff getting there,then joined the crowds for the tram ride. Saw the animals,and they were good, however soon over,and not much else to see. Usual gift shops and food. A very average evening."
,,Too dark,4.0,,"First, it's a long way from the city and a long line wait for a 40 min tram ride. Animals were amazing but it was too dark.

I know it's supposed to be dark because it's Night Safari. But hey it's close to zero visibility. I'm sure there's a reason for it. But we have our reasons in paying the money too which is to see the animals. Please find a way to lit up the place just a little to make it worth it.

The animal show at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30 was fun."
,,Nothing Much,3.0,,"Basically,animals are snoozing at night,and we couldnt see much animals.Walking route was quite far and the routes are very dark.Thats why they provided us with the tram ride so you can just sit down,relax and watch the animals while they tour around the safari.The tram was the only plus point.But the tram ride was having a super long queue,so need to wait for some time."
,,Compact but overwhelming,5.0,,It's a long way from the city but it's worth the time. The zoo is not big but you will be surprised by how well the landscape is designed. You get on a train and it takes you around. There's no fence at all but animals are so close! There are also walking trails. One of them leads to see the bats. The bats are right in front of me feeding on the fruits hanged. It's really amazing!
,,"No good, less visibility",2.0,,Waiting for the tram is about 1 hour... The tram trip about 40 minutes.. Nothing special...the tour guide told us a lot of animal but some of them was hiding around...so we just saw the plant..haha
,,Nice place but watch the travel...!,3.0,,"I am not a zoo person, but this is a nice attraction. the animals look well cared for and have nice enviroments to live in.
When it opens everyone watches the shows, fire jugglers etc...tip 1 miss the front of the show and go to the back far side, otherwise you will be way back when the queues start forming...
Tip 2 get off the train at the half way point, walking around in the enclosures is worth it, also there are drinks and food available.
worth doing when in the town,
The Major down side, they say a 40min trip from the town, with transport included..!
Yes great service on the way out, pick up and A/C bus to the zoo..
on the way back..40mins waiting for the bus to fill and then 2hours 50mins back to our drop off!! the bus went to every hotel in the town, ours just happened to be the last, so watch out. we were exhausted when we eventually got off!
If we had known we would have taken a taxi, the return journey spoiled our tour."
,,Night Safari Magic,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning safari on little trains, and through the Zoo to see animals at night. Able to see all points where animals were present, and had very good guide with facts about the Zoo and the animals. Followed this with a 20 minute animal show. Loved the otters that were taught to recycle metal, plastic and paper."
,,Night safari-really for tourists but entertaining,3.0,,"I have done this tour yesterday night.i was lucky enought to have been one the first to wait and bord the first tram so I did not wait at all!!! Do not except to take photos as it is dark & no flash is allowed so your photos wont be good! The tram tour was ok-nothing exceptional though!
I went to the creatures of the night show after and that was fun and good :) I was too tired after to walk aroumd the park so went to eat something at bongo burger. $15.90 for a buger with fries. Nothing exceptional about the burger or the fries but I was starving.i then took a taxi back to my hotel which is a bit far from the city and it only costed me $22"
,,Take the tram to see more,4.0,,We were lucky enough to go midweek and out of school holidays so were pleasantly surprised at the lack of crowds. We arrived early as advised and did not have to queue for anything. We initially decided against taking the train as that was a little busy and full of lots of screaming and crying children and lots of parents who I'm sure would like to have screamed or cried if socially accepted. So we initially walked the park which I must say is vast. We actually only managed to see three quarters by foot as we raced back to see the last creatures of the night show. If you see nothing else make sure you make this a priority. It was fantastic. Yes it is a bit cheesy but it was just so entertaining and the poor staff who have to do this several times a night showed no sign of being bored by the act whats so ever. I guess the saying never work with children or animals could be true as they are unpredictable. This only added to the joy for us as things did not go as smoothly as they were obviously meant to. Not that anyone was in danger or anything like that it was just funny. Very Very funny. So after this show we decided to get on the tram and do one last lap and we were not disappointed. In fact I think we got more up close and personal with the animals then on foot. So all in all a great night out. I few tips that I'm sure people have already commented on but worth reminding. Take a taxi unless you are seriously short on cash. It is not that far so not too expensive. Also the bus takes a long time and is a hassle. Also make sure you eat before hand that bit was expensive. Wear long sleeves and long pants and lots and lots of insect repellant. Make sure you look for deals for reduced entrance prices - we used a two for one deal found in a tourist magazine. And last but not least - seriously take the tram and make sure you sit on the right hand side for a more intimate experience.
,,Not exactly worth the wait,2.0,,"We didn't exactly know what we got ourselves into, but the 40min wait to board the tram wasn't fun at all. It was so humid and icky, there wasn't enough ventilation at all! The safari itself was ok, but it got kind of boring when we pretty much saw the same animals as we did at the zoo. The tram should've showed the felines instead of what was already in thrme zoo :<"
,,Let down by its success,3.0,,"A novel idea that should work but unfortunately it has become so successful that the screaming crowds spoilt the experience for us. Huge queues for the tram, over excitable commentary and over excitable children that must have been scaring the animals silly. When walking the trails it was difficult to see some small animals as they were in hiding. On the plus side, the buffet meal included in our tour price was very good."
,,Must walk the trail!,4.0,,Its my second visit to this park and since there are lots of people waiting for the tram ride our tour guide suggested we walk the trail so i decided to walk and i can say its more fun than being in the tram. You can move at your pace and you can enjoy your time seeing nocturnal animals meters away from you. Its a safe place and kids will love the idea of walking in the trail. A must see in singapore alongside with the singapore zoo and river safari. A must see is the tribal show near the restaurants. Highly recommended for all ages :)
,,Awsme experience.. try to go on weekdays for lesser crowd..,4.0,,its scary as well as adventurous to see animals so close.. they r definately trained so cheers to the team who maintains it...!
,,Night Safari - Fun for the Family,5.0,,"Singapore's Night Safari is fun for the family. Go late in the afternoon, indulge in the surroundings before you embark on the actual night safari journey..."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"This is my family 1st time to Night Safari.it was a great experience for my 4 years old daughter.Eventhough sometimes we cannot see the animal when we are riding the tram but its a great journey.

One thing that should be fixed is how tourist like me to have refund GST form when we are at he front desk.My wife ask the cashier is there anyway we could have GST refund form and she said it cannot be done because thats the policy."
,,she wh !ust be obeyed's far eastern soiree.. night safari at singapore zoo,1.0,,"Right if any one so far has read any of my rambles about where we have stayed then you might think I have rose tinted spectacles and that everything is wonderful in my perspective !!

Hotels so far encountered have not had any problems as far as I can see that have been worth mentioning ( slight delays in check in, or heavens forbid a sparrow in an open air restaurant do not count !!)

However we both had serious misgivings with regard to the night safari..
A friend had reccomened this to us so we made it one of our must do visits while in Singapore, which when you are there only three nights means fitting a lot of other stuff in too and perhaps in fairness we were tired, but!

I get the concept of the night safari, lots of animals are naturally nocturnal and being able to view them in a more natural way makes sense.
But here's the rub, we had to queue for fifty five rather hot and cramped minutes to get onto the tram that takes you around.
Then we were given a safety briefing about not eating or drinking and not poking arms or legs outside the tram !! All good common sense really you would think, along with the advice that you should turn OFF the FLASH on your camera as it will startle the animals and that talking should be kept to low decibels... Every one understand ?? Right off we go then...
And off the tram trundles to the first low lit area for observation,
The tram comes to a halt, the guide starts to mention the specific animals you will see and night turns to day as all the flashes go off at once ,yet not a flinch from the beasts on view( perhaps they no longer have much of a retina left ).
The guide again comes out with the turn the flashes off statement and off we trundle, the behind me a phone rings and a bloke launches into a five minutes conversation at the top of his voice.
We reach the next viewing station and again night turns to day!! Four times the guide stopped the tram the go over in 5 different languages that flashes should be off, in between that the bloke behind had two other calls.

Perhaps I misjudged the safari bit, it was actually just a guided tour of some areas with animals in , during the dark.
Now someone in a post here mentioned a drugged looking lion or tiger, I saw a very unhappy looking elephant shuffling backwards and forwards.

Once off the tram you are taken to a food, bar area_( don't bother with bongo burgers) and then you can view the show put on by the blokes from deepest darkest Borneo.. Acts of daring do ? Deadly use of swords or spears ? Nope just fire eating to loud thumping music ...

I applaud well run zoo's as a meaningful form of animal welfare and conservation but quite frankly would rather have given the £40 it cost straight to the world wildlife fund.

In short it wasn't for us......."
,,Amazing - the Night Safari is a must!,5.0,,"We happened to visit the Night Safari on probably their busiest night of the year (period between Xmas and NYE, Saturday night during their 'Light Festival'). Poor planning on our behalf aside, it was a brilliant third experience of the Night Safari.
Every time I visit the Safari I am impressed again by the beauty of the grounds, the excellent maintenance and the care taken of the animals."
,,I'd come back time and again!,4.0,,Was here last year with mum on her birthday. This time round was for its 20th anniversary. Very good crowd control I think. The creatures of the night performance is awesome and you'd never get sick of taking the tram round and round.
,,Night safari,3.0,,"We were didappointed by this - mainly because the zoo is a way out of town and as it was raining it took our bus ages to get there from the centre of the city. The evening was considerably shortened because of the length of the journey and we felt that value for money was therefore reduced. The zoo itself, what we saw of it, seemed fine.

Also watch out for the fare collectors on the bus. We caught the regular bus that goes to all the hotels - we were told we could buy a return bus ticket more cheaply but the ticket collector wouldn't let us as we would not buy our zoo ticket from him (as we had a discount voucher which he would not honour). Not as good an experience as we had hoped"
,,MUST VISIT,5.0,,"It is suituated at the outskits of the Singapore City. It can be quite expensive to go there in private Taxi. Generally the tour operators provide sharing cabs to visti this place and come back. That will be an economical option.

There is a night show iin the night safari. That shown is must watch. The show feature the animals.

Advicable to take a ride in the tram to have round of the entire zoo.

The place has good resturnats at the entrace gate. I also find good Indian vegetarian food there.

Must visit place , if you are travelling to Singapore.

The entrance ticket cost of the safari is quite on expensive side. it is just 2-3 hours attraction and the money charged for the same is too much."
,,Night Safari needs to be revitalised,2.0,,"I brought a colleague from overseas to visit the Night Safari on 28 May 2014. This is my 3rd time there and probably would be my last. The last 3 visits were awesome and I always recommend friends and visitors to visit the Night Safari.

1) The management of the zoo had made this entity way too commercial. How can you have Trams that turned to restaurant parked in the park and diners dine and wine away. This scene totally ruin my enjoyment in the night safari

2) The daily creature of the night show. I was there at the 7:30pm show. How disappointing is the show. None of the crew show any enthusiasm at all. I can't blame the animals but the crew, they are a total let down. No passion at all to entertain the crowd at all.

3) Good to know you advocate recycling and conservation and the message were repeated on and on. But when you charge good money for people to dine and wine in a rain forest, your message gets a bit hypocritical

4) Crowd control, poor. After the first show at 0730 pm, the queue to the tram were disorganised. Human traffic were coming from everywhere. There were no one to lead and organise the crowd. Staff were standing around looking at each other. One were even cracking a joke with another staff member to let it be. Come on !!!!!

So we walked, from the starting point to the east lodge trail. Did we see a lot ? I think it is alright in the dark. From the East Lodge trail we took the tram

5) The commentary on the tram were again lack of passion. A single monotone which lead to my guest to comment that she thought was a recorded message

6) We went on a second ride on the tram. Kudos to the young lady guide. She save the trip for us. She brought out the night safari to us by being knowledgeable and creative in delivering her commentary. Because of her we learnt much more even though it was a repeated ride.

Unless the management realise that their pursue of bottomline are ruining the experience of its visitor, they will lose me as their visitor again. I hate to say this but I will not recommend a visit to the night safari especially for those who are here on their own expense and not part of a tour group. At S$39 per adult for ticket price, it is expensive. More so when you might not see 50% of the animals in the night if you don't get off the tram and walk the trails."
,,Great place,5.0,,Great place for kids to appreciate animal and plant life. There were shows to entertain a broad range of age groups.
,,Exciting,5.0,,"We did the night safari and found it to be an amazing way to see animals at night. The tram was comfortable and if you camera works in the dark, easy to take pictures from. Don't forget insect repellant."
,,A unique experience,3.0,,"Admittedly, my review is tapered by my distinct dislike of zoo's (this is a zoo not a safari), but my principles are easily compromised when you have a girlfriend that will give you earache until she gets her own way! ;0)

The setting is in the rainforest and creates a mood that makes you feel like you are in the heart of the jungle. It was very impressive in creating an atmosphere. Once you have paid at the entrance you make your way through the courtyard with their many gift shops to the queue for the tram.

The tram guides you around the many secluded roads past enclosures containing Hyena's, Lions, Elephants, Tigers, etc. There is no flash photography allowed, so you will be lucky to get any photographs as a memento, as the setting is very dark, being in the forest.

Once you have got off the ride, you then have the option of taking one of the many themed paths around the zoo. It remains very atmospheric and the jungle certainly doesn't sleep at night! It is good to try and spot the animals and guess what is in each enclosure.

BUT the reason for my average review, is because this is only a safari on the basis that you can drive round it. I consider a safari to be a place where the animals have huge enclosures and can almost wander as free as what they would in the wild. The enclosures here are every bit as small as a medium sized zoo, and it distressed me hugely to see the Bull Elephant rocking back and forth in a small area of where they reside. I saw several animals running around in circles and it just left me uneasy about the amount of freedom they have."
,,Cheesy kids stuff,2.0,,"If you are into Playhouse Disney, Nic Jnr and Cbeebies then this will appeal otherwise forget it. The live narration is fist chewingly awful, the animals look like they'd rather be anywhere else and the queues are infernal. Then there's the show which all participants have clearly done a gazillion times and despite their best efforts they seem about as sincere and enthusiastic as the many, many half-asleep deer that are on display on the ""safari"". The elephants that you do see look vaguely distressed and the pat ""save the forest cause they're chopping 'em down"" plea is cringe inducing, simplistic and just very, very juvenile. And by the time you're done it's way past the bed-time of the small children who may just about like it... And unless you have way too much money, whatever you do, don't purchase any of the many offerings - there's rip off and then there's Singapore's Night safari rip off."
,,So far so good,2.0,,"I'm actually went with my boyfriend, so far there's not much animal in the night safari and I think it is not worth as the ticket is $39 per person. I think zoo or river safari should be better than night safari."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"It was definitely worth a visit. Starting from Fire Shows when you enter and getting into the trams all the while make you feel curious of what is coming next. The Tram ride takes you through with a guide informing about the animals and surroundings. I personally being an animal lover it was a treat to watch them in night with no lights around. The experience was beautiful and scary for some that at times you would feel something walking next to your tram and you notice an animal right next to you.

People tend to not follow the rules, which is quite irritating. Rather then enjoying the night life of these animals, they are just into flashing lights or shouting, ultimately scaring the animal. After the night safari there are different shows which take place in the same area with animals doing the acrobats and the trainers trying to involve the audience in the same. In all a good experience and a must go for animal lovers."
,,So-so,3.0,,"The idea of a night safari certainly sounds great, but that's about as good as it gets.
The ride out of town must be done during peak traffic, which doesn't get things off to a good start. However, save yourself money and get the tourist bus - details from your concierge - it's around S$10/S$6 return. But the last one leaves at 22.15, with the Zoo closing at midnight - odd!
There is a fiery show (quite good) at the entry point but long, long queues thereafter. The animal show isn't too bad either, but the ""tram"" ride is actually a bus and although it rumbles through the canopy, there isn't really much going on.
Admittedly it teemed for the latter part of our visit, so we didn't do any of the trails, but for the money (S$120 for a family) we didn't think it represented good value.
The biggest drawback is the food/drink. The Zoo is situated on its own and as such, does not have any nearby shops. Consequently, if you are hungry, be prepared to pay a premium. But my biggest criticism concerns water. Singapore is very humid and every other attraction we visited had water fountains galore. Not here. Thirsty? Pay for a bottle of water (S$2).
If you do go, see your hotel for vouchers or take your passport as you get a 10% discount on entry, which is a little cheaper than they try and sell you on the tourist bus.
Maybe it just wasn't our cup of tea."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"This was a great trip.
The tram ride takes you through with audio, very clear and informative. Only negative was people ignoring rules about flashes on cameras, talking loudly and putting small children on the outside, very annoying as spent time telling them to be quiet (adults) so as not to scare the animals away that had ventured close to the tram.
The walking. Route was also wonderful. Really worth a visit"
,,A must watch place,4.0,,"Its an amazing experience to watch the animals closely at night in a tram ride. But one must sure that you are ready to wait in the Queue for atleast an hour. Plan well so that you do not miss the performance shows, and then go for a safari. The safari in the tram usually lasts for 30 -45 mins depending on the blocking of the animals on the way. You can also get down from the tram at stops and walk the trails."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"We went here on a rainy night and still had a great time. Some of the animal shows were cancelled due to the weather but you could still walk around all the trails and the tram was still running.

It is pretty thrilling to know you are walking around in the dark with wild animals, by thrilling I mean a little terrifying but well worth it.

It is quite a drive out of the city, best to get your hotel to organise a taxi or transfer as we tried to get a taxi for around an hour the first night we tried to go. We got stuck in traffic and the taxi was around $40SD but there was a bus that was $8SD but we only found out about this when we came out of the safari.

Little tip, if there is a big que at the first tram stop go do a couple of walking trails and get on at the second tram stop."
,,A great night,4.0,,Visited the night zoo and had a great time. My wife was a little wary being so close to the bats nibbling on their fruit. It was great to get so close to the animals
,,so-so experience,3.0,,the safari was so crowded and we only got to do the tram ride with the kids...I think we would have had more fun if we went to the Singapore zoo instead of the night safari but our time was tight and so couldn't do both...the tram ride took us across the park but most of the animals were either sleeping or inactive...also the fact that the tram was open from both sides and I could see the lions from across was kind of scary..it was too dark and we were warned not to use flash...wished we were protected more from the animals to feel safe..i'm sure the park authorities do keep it 100% safe but we still had the fear feeling..after our ride there was a show for exotic animals that was full and the next show as at 10.30pm...we couldn't wait that long with the kids and so we left..also we didn't wander around the park on our own cause we were kind of scared from all the roaming animals and having the kids with us...
,,For Kids Only...,2.0,,"To be fair, like most things in Singapore this attraction is clean, safe, family friendly, well organised and controlled despite the extremely large crowd.

However it is also short on any kind of excitement, the food and drinks are way overpriced and the transport there and back only adds to the feeling of a wasted night.

Perhaps for a family with young children it may be worth the visit. But unless you have some ankle biters in tow find something else to do.

I had to limp away from the attraction with pins and needles in both feet and legs having ended up riding the tram in a seat where all the leg room was taken up by the forward wheel arch. Then paying almost $ 20 for two single scoup ice creams before a one and half hour bus ride back to the Hotel pretty much said it all for me."
,,FEED THE KANGAROO,5.0,,First time to feed a kangaroo.. since there are no kangaroos in the Philippines. Night Safari is the best!
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Not to be missed, one of a kind...go on a Sunday when it is less crowded. Enjoyed the tram rude...not to be missed though cpuld be a long wait"
,,not really that great...,3.0,,"the best part about the attraction is the animal show. must watch it. otherwise, it is just taking the tram and going one big round of the safari. sometimes you dont get to see some animals cos they are blocked by the set up of the safari. if you go during the peak period - public holidays, weekends, be prepared to spend quite a bit of time queuing for the show and the tram.
you should go and queue for the show early to get a good seat. try to sit near the stage. it is nicer and more fun as you might be involved in the show. i will keep that as a secret."
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,"The one ""must see"" attraction in Singapore in my eyes. Unique animals, which you don't normally see. Well designed, cages, where you are inside with the animals. Make sure you spend enough time in the flying fox/bat enclosure. If you are lucky, one of them will fly over your head. eerie..."
,,Soooo disappointed,2.0,,"We were excited about doing the night safari at the zoo as we had stayed at Western Plains Zoo for their night safari experience. Firstly, to line up like cattle for over 45 minutes, to be herded onto the open carriages was humiliating, however, it did allow for interesting people watching. There were not a lot of animals to view and to see two of the animals in distress (an elephant and a tiger) was very upsetting. We were told that the zoo puts itself in the same class as the Western Plains but it was not even close."
,,Our Visit Was Excellent,5.0,,"We managed to pick one of the worst days to visit the night safari. It was a public holiday long weekend in Singapore. However, the staff showed great assistance for us and we were treated to a fantastic night. The tram ride is a must as well as the animal show! Excellent place and wish we had done this on previous trips to Singapore"
,,Not Something You Can Find Anywhere,5.0,,"This is a must if you come to Singapore for first time. No humid weather, hot sunny day, or sweating all the way while enjoying the animals.

Buy the tram ticket, ride it once, then enjoy the rest by walking... I love this and recommend everyone to do so.

Repeated visit will be good for kids."
,,A unique concept to viewing animals in the zoo,5.0,,"The Night Safari was established on a unique concept that most zoo animals are nocturnal animals. Most sleep during the day and roam and walk around at night. Hence when you visit the zoo during the day time you often find the animals are asleep and you cannot see much. In the case of the Night Safari in Singapore you get to see a host of animals roaming around in their natural habitat. There is ambient light provided so that it is not too bright to be a distraction to the animals but sufficient for people to walk around to view the animals.
There is also a tram that brings you round the place and this is specially useful for those who may not want to walk. For those who can walk it is still worthwhile to buy the tickets for the tram ride to get an overview and you can then follow up with a walk around on your own."
,,Nocturnal animals,3.0,,Wonderful fire eating show! Great animal show! Slow but breezy ride on the tram. Close encounters with some animals which are roaming around. The hated part.... Ignorant people who simply uses flash when countless announcement being made DO NOT USE FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY!!! But food too expensive for a small portion!
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"A must-see attraction in Singapore for the scale and diversity.
Easily lose 3 hours walking the paths and then taking the tramcar around the whole site.
The layout, numerous species and night aspect make for a really interesting and engaging experience.
So much larger than we expected yet not exhausting at all. And the animal shows were far better than expected."
,,Not too bad!,3.0,,"Nothing extraordinary but still something to do in SG. Same as any other place in Singapore, it is well maintained. SG weather doesn't help either!"
,,Only tourists checklist,2.0,,"This a clear attraction with excellent marketing but disappointing when you visit it.
The tram ride starts of promising, but then when you see Indian Bisons and more Bisons..and deer, the ride isnt as fun - then a tiger pops up who looks drugged and in the spotlight, looks pretty sick :(."
,,special celebration 20th anniversary,5.0,,"Last Saturday, night safari was 20 years old...big celebration in night safari with new arrival of animals in addition...
guest of honour, mr c t goh and claire chang visiting the park...
it was v crowded and full of people gathering at the performance. .
my friends and I have great time..
special ticket price at $20 per person...
it only ran over weekend ...special deal :)"
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Brilliant place to cool down after a day's sightseeing. If you are too tired, you can just enjoy the tram trip. Find out the show times first, and plan your trip around that."
,,Engaging and enriching,4.0,,"Did you know that 90% of rainforest / tropical animals are nocturnal?

There's plenty to see just travelling on the open-air tram around the park! The enclosures are all open - no fencing, just moats, trees and topography.

There was a rhinoceros bathing in the ""moonlight"" (the lighting of the animals at various points is designed to simulate gentle moonlight, although it's much brighter); various species of deer grazing or crossing the path; a Malayan tapir nosing about the ground; a sloth bear digging for termites; and an entire pride of lions, with two males, sitting in a row and gazing steadily at you...and more.

There's a guide onboard the tram who points out the animals and gives a little bit of facts.

The Night Safari has added three new exhibits this year.

You can opt to walk on the trails for a closer look at other animals not on the tram track; it's at night but there are guides around with flashlights. I didn't walk.

The Creatures of the Night performance (not like the Seaworld type, don't worry) was most entertaining, not least because of the excellent presenter Natalie.

NOTE: ABSOLUTELY NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY. You don't want the hyenas leaping at you, or worse, the beautiful giraffes going blind."
,,Night safari?,2.0,,"If you have a friend you have not met in a while and you decide to meet in Singapore, there are probably 5 sites to see really. One of them is this! A few animals made to live in a zoo that you had to strain to see.
The only commendable thing is that Singapore is trying to support conservation greatly. I respect that, but feel sad to watch these animals in their enclosures. Still, maybe families will enjoy the rides, food, fire shows and an evening out in a city/ country with very few other attractions."
,,One of a kind attraction,4.0,,Must do in Singapore if it's your first time. Kids and adults would love it. Limited on healthy food options so carry your water and a snack. Sometimes getting a cab can be difficult so taking a bus might be easier
,,Must go!,5.0,,"Loved the concept of Night safari. it's a good idea to take their trails too. I've definitely enjoyed the night show. Quite packed, even on a weekday. Need to queue for the tram ride. Having said that, the tram ride provides a lot of information about the animals too."
,,Night Safari offers an exciting night time adventure for animal lovers.,4.0,,"My husband and I both love the great outdoors and all animals in general. And we happen to be very spontaneous, too. So on one random Saturday in March, we just hailed a cab and went to the Night Safari and what we saw there blew us away! First of all, the whole place is as neat and organized as in most places in Singapore. The collection of animals, to my think, is pretty neat. We fell in love with the elephant, which when set against the pitch-black sky background, looks larger and more beautiful! The wolves were especially creepy with their signature howling. All in all, it was a great experience for us and we now looking forward to exploring the Singapore Zoo and River Safari real soon!"
,,Unique experience,5.0,,First and only night safari*. That was the tagline when I last visited. It is an interesting experience to visit wildlife and learn how they behave at night. Everyone who's here in Singapore should make time to visit it. It could even be a spontaneous evening activity!
,,Animals in the night...,4.0,,"It is a unique experience especially for kids. A visit to the night safari takes atleast 2 to 2.5 hours if you take the tram it will take you longer if you plan to do the walking trail. We did just the tram.you can get off the tram and take the walking trail to see some tinier animals. Though it was not a weekend but it was very crowded and the queues were long to get to the tram. There is an animal show that happens, first show starting at 7.30 pm and then every hour till 10.30 pm(10.30 show is only on Friday Saturday and eve of an public holiday). This show happens in an open air amphitheater so if it rains(which happens very often in Singapore) then the show gets cancelled. This is included in the night safari ticket itself. It is 30 mins show. Do not miss this as it is choreographed well and is very entertaining. Try getting a seat right in the front for better view.

The tram takes you through the trail with a guide talking about the animals as you see them. We were lucky as all the animals were sitting under the light and we could see them clearly. The fee to the night safari is 39 SGD we booked the tickets online and got a 10% discount. You need not carry any printouts, you can show the eticket on your mobile

Tip: wear comfortable clothes as it gets warm, use a mosquito repellent cream as you ll be going through a dense forest like area where there are mosquitoes. Enjoy watching the animals at night rather than trying to take pictures because anyways flash photography is prohibited."
,,Nice place for kids and adults too,4.0,,It is real good way to see the animals in there natural environment and that too at night. The way of showing the animals there is also very informative. They also conduct a 30 min show and that is impressive too.
,,must see,5.0,,The night safari is a must see when you are in Singapore. It is great fun to ride the tram and walk around to see animals up close that you would not see during the day. Give yourself at least two and half to three hours.
,,Night time zoo,4.0,,"Although the queues were long, we got to sit on a spacious carriage for the night tour. We saw typical zoo animals in their natural habitat but some animals were not that active and other hard to see as they shunned the subdued lights.

We walked a section past the fishing cats, etc and that gave us a closer look at animals that normally aren't seen during daylight hours. I guess it was more suitable for children but the late finish may be an issue.
There was food available from several open kitchens but i think the hygiene may not be absolute.

There were fire breathers that put on a show at around 9pm that was entertaining."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,Lovely view of animals in the open. Pity we could not take pics because of the no flash restriction. Creatures of the night show was also quite entertaining.
,,Up close to animals,3.0,,"Visited on 25/05/2014...Night Safari celebrate it's 20th Anniversary, so starting from 24th-26th, these 3days, its ticket only sold at $20 only...Usual admission ticket $39
We ate at Bongo Burger, food quite ok...each person spend about $20+...I have tried the Crispy Wings (4pcs of fried chicken wings in a basket). My friends tried the Chunky Vegie Burger n Pasta Chicken Sausage...We can watched the fire show closely at our seating area...is interesting as the 3 performers, they swallowed fire...
Even though the queue for tram ride was quite long but the waiting time just about 10mins only...Tram ride was amazing as we get to see n almost could touch the animals as the tram is sooooo near to the animals n was very cooling as winds r blowing to us along the whole ride...
The only Cons was as it was very dark n not allowed to turn on flash(a Big No No) as it will spoiled e animals eyesight...haha!!!so all the pics turned out to be just black spot only...We missed the Creatures of the Night Show as it is fully seated :( ...but we took a walked to the Walklybly Trial...Where can saw the cute Walklybly, Malayan Tiger through e glass view panel, it came so close to e glass panel n it looks so big, its amazing...I found that there were many different types of deers, buffaloes in this Safari...haha!!! Was wondering it is deers n buffaloes tend to adopt in night environmental...After all it was quite an interesting experience..."
,,Very worthwhile,5.0,,"I'm not a great one for going to zoos but loved the night safari. It was great to spot all the animals at this time of day as they are much more active. The enclosures were generally small, which meant the animals were much easier to spot, but despite this the animals somehow seemed very comfortable. Although the tram ride at first seemed to me a bit ""touristy"" it turned out to be really good as it was informative and took us past some of the animals which you wouldn't see otherwise, including the elephant which was born and raised at the zoo.
Overall it was a very worthwhile experience. Just bear in mind that it gets quite hot so dress light.
We needed the full 4 hours to get through all the enclosure but did include a half hour dinner break at the food hall."
,,Nice but more waiting than actual sight seeing.,4.0,,I loved the idea of seeing the animals by dark. Unfortunately it was very busy so the queue for the tram took more then an hour. The ride itself was amazing but too short and too little time to see the animals (all rush rush) but with nice explanations. I wish we had more time in comparison with the waiting time. We missed the show because it was fully and the next show was when we already had to be back at bus..... We walked around the park and that is well worth it. Food at the entrance was very overpriced!! But this seems to be normal at these type of attractions!?! Overall what we saw was great but way too short.
,,The Big 5 up close,4.0,,"We enjoyed the Night Safari greatly. You ride an open tram which completes a 40-50 min circuit. You have the option of hopping off at certain points and walking the ""walking trails"". This allows you to see smaller animals up close. You can ride the tram circuit as many times as you like.
I was surprised at how close we got to animals like Lions, Tigers, Rhino's, etc. These cannot be seen from the walking trails and only on the moving trams.
Being night time it is very hard to take photo's as you cannot use your flash and this is regulated.
The gift shops were very expensive.
My only complaint was that some parents allowed their children to scream and bang on the glass which would cause the animals to run and hide, this happened over and over and was very annoying. Anyways if you want to see the Big 5 in action this is a great attraction."
,,Unique Zoo Experience,5.0,,"Night safari in Singapore is very unique experience. We started our safari at around 8pm and it took us approximately 3 hrs. We started with Tram and got down at first stop itself to enter the walking trail. We covered all walking trails, watched lion feeding and then got into tram again to take complete round of the zoo. It was very crowded and we had to wait for almost half an hour to get into tram again. My advice is to take full tram tour and then start walking into the trails. Also try to start safari in first slot itself as walking trails are much more fun when the crowd is less."
,,Best Zoo.,5.0,,We did the river safari and night zoo. The zoo was well kept and fairly quiet on a weekday. We caught the MRT and bus to the so which was cheap and easy. Thereis plenty to look at and it is well priced.
,,A never before experience,5.0,,This place is quite far from Singapore city. It is in the same complex where there is river Safari and Singapore zoo . The safari starts from Thumbukar performance where two Singaporeans will show some breathtaking stunts with fire. It would be best if you book the tickets online. Then you can do it by two ways . Either by trekking or by tram . Then at 7:30 there is show called creatures of the night . This show is also a must do show. You can see many nocturnal animals like wolves and owls. Overall a must do
,,Lovely experience during Night Safari,5.0,,"We went for the Night Safari and it is every bit as exciting as advertised. The buggy train ride and the taped voice guide was a good experience. The night animals are not tied and huddle under spotlights so that one can enjoy seeing them but not get too close. The rainforest created inside is authentic with the trees with thick canopy, the stillness of the jungle and the creaking of the bugs - you experience all of it! Then there is the show where handlers put some of the night animals on stage. Fascinating for the kids - it is a experience worth sharing."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"We opted for just the night safari after seeing it as an attraction in a well known guide book. Considering the price ($39 each) we were very disappointed. It is very difficult to see the animals, as the tram ride quickly passes each enclosure before you can fully see.

The animal show was ok, but more directed towards families with small children. All in all, if you are in Singapore for a short stay, don't go here."
,,unique experience. ..,4.0,,"Visiting the night safari was a memorable and unique experience for me and my kid. Passing through the forest, and coming across different animals will make you feel wonderful and adventurous. Please keep one thing in mind that, DO NOTuse flash while taking pictures, as this disturbs the animals in the dark."
,,Not interesting at all!!,2.0,,"For the park ticket it costs around $39 per adult with Tram ride however there is something called as Park hoppers which gives you discount on purchase of ticket of 2 or max 3 parks(Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari). I’m sure at least you would do 2park so why not save some dollars, isn’t it? Park is open from 1930 untill midnight.
The only thing we liked about the park was the show! Apart from that nothing was interesting…. The dark effect in whole park is very nice. other thing we liked about the park was the show! Apart from that nothing was interesting…."
,,okey!,3.0,,I have recently visited singapore and went Night safari. I had a mix experiences. Seeing animals during nights are awesome. But the queue to go and money you pay is still not worth enough because you will see very little animals. For those who come from small towns and villages and had seen animals already then you can skip. If not one time experience is okey.
,,Creatures of the night,4.0,,"It was interesting..some creatures seem to pose for visitors...be early because there is a long line for tram tours..by the time you reach end of tram tour, the show creatures of the night is already close due to no more available space. The only problem is there is only one show for the night."
,,How do they do that?!?!,4.0,,"Amazing zoo experience like non other. How do they separate all those animals without us seeing a lot of fences? It is as if the animals pose for you in the lights,,,but I guess they know where to find their food. Yes always a noisy guy on the tram/bus, but walk the trails if you dare! And a few pushy people in line but the zoo can't control that part.

I would like to see a separate line just to get a beer separate from the main food court. Dropped out of line when they could have made an extra $26 on us. Still hot and so humid in the evening."
,,night safari,3.0,,Very few animals. Not worth the wait in the que. However viewing animals at night is a unique experience
,,A loooong and tiring walk,2.0,,"The walking trail is really challenging. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as the roads are hilly and the distance long. The walk can be tough for young children and older people. Not many animals to see and nothing particularly special. I find it expensive with the kind of attractions available. A better choice is to go to the afternoon Singapore zoo, much more entertaining for the kids."
,,Okay,3.0,,"We booked this tour through our hotel, it included transport between the safari and our hotel, entry, bus 'tour guide' and tram (55SGD). If you're going to do it, it's probably worth the extra fees of such a tour, to have everything arranged for you and transport sorted; it is a bit out of the town so taxi wouldn't be cheap and bus might be long and has the added risk of getting lost/ not getting there on time etc...

Also, you can't really do this safari without the tram (45mins round the park), it's just not worth it, but I think you pay extra for it unless you do one of the tours where it's usually included.

As we went on an eve of a bank holiday, also available Fri and Sat, there was an included animal show, which if you are there and get the chance I would recommend. Doesn't last very long, maybe 30minutes, but the animals are trained to do some cool stuff! On these same selected days they also have a man eating fire show.

Overall, you get to see a fair few animals and the shows are entertaining but I couldn't always hear the guidance on the tram and the whole experience seemed to be over quite quick...

Personally I could take or leave the night safari experience. It was nothing amazing and whilst our tour guide told us we would be able to alight on and off the tram to do some trails, we were not offered the opportunity to do so by the safari. That said, if you have small children, then it might keep them amused for an evening."
,,Not worth it,1.0,,I went there after hearing a lot about it . May be my expectations were high but it definately didn't live upto it. First of all its really far from the city . Takes about 2 hours to reach. Secondly not many animals around in the safari. The delhi zoo is anytime better. Don't waste time and money on this one.
,,An Awesome trip,5.0,,"Like everything about it, the shows, the night safari, river safari. It is well maintained and well organized."
,,Loved the cats!,4.0,,"I am a cat lover, and when they came out I loved it. A few tips - It pays to try and keep to yourself, away from the crowds and groups, especially children. Other people can be noisy (there is always ""that guy"" or group). When people can't understand to ""turn off your flash on your cameras and no bright lights from your screens"" It can get a bit frustrating. However, that isn't the park or staffs fault, and the whole experience was awesome. My tip, don't miss the show on at the amphitheatre. It's simply brilliant! We also had the Asian buffet at Ulu Ulu, which had a bit of Indian as well. Great food, debatable if it was worth $44 each, but that's just the way it is with these high profile places, and it was convenient."
,,Up To You,2.0,,I found this attraction to be pretty boring and the location is far from the downtown. They offer a tram ride through the park and a Creature of the Night show.
,,Worth it...,4.0,,"The night safari was our first stop after landing and we weren't disappointed.,,,, beautifully maintained... no smelly odors of animals....the animals oif the night show was excellent... and the tour of the park was breath taking...for those who wish to get the feel of the jungle, can alight from the car and go on foot....mind you its a long walk ...."
,,Favorite zoo attraction,5.0,,"I would go back and do this again and again. Nocturnal animals are so difficult to see in the wild; the park affords you such a rare opportunity to see creatures most folks never see. We got there early and had something to eat right outside the zoo while waiting for it to open. Try the watermelon juice! We looked at the shops and then watched the opening event right at the entrance. Don't miss that! When we entered, we went straight to the animal show. I enjoyed the show immensely. Then walked around the park and through the walk-in aviaries for bats/flying foxes, and the flying squirrels. We then came back to the front and took the tram ride as the line was shorter by then. We got there when the park opened and left around 9:30, I think - the time passed so quickly!"
,,Worth it...,5.0,,"We took a guided tour,a small train takes u around with a commentary explaining very precisely regarding the animals to your left or right,secondly there are two show which r not be missed.."
,,"I want to visit again, just awesome.",5.0,,"Who said there was nothing to do at night in singapore for all members of a family. This is it. The night safari is for everyone.

If you have young kids, let them snooze in the afternoon so they can enjoy the night out. Excluding the transport time allocate at least two hours+ to enjoy this venue.

The ""creatures of the night show"" is at 7.30pm, 8.30, 9.30. On weekends there's one at 10.30pm. So time your trip well to see the show and take the team ride. Go to www.nightsafari.com.sg to learn about times and shows and trails to plan you evening better. You only have from 7.30pm till midnight to enjoy.

The animals are very visible and at night they appear amazing. You can hear the hyenas or lions. I walked a trail and rested by staring into tropical jungle and staring back at me was this huge bear. There is a greeting feeling of harmony of animals and man and the park staff do an excellent job.

Tip: get off the tram and enjoy the walking trails too. It's usually hot and humid so carry your cold water and a fan to cool down. There's places to eat too so enjoy dinner snacks at the tram stop somewhere in the middle of park. Tram moves at okay pace but keep eyes open to spot the animals and spend less time chatting :-)

I look forward to my next visit. Worth the price for the life experience. Last tip; weekday nights are less crowded."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We went there after a rainy day, the air was quite fresh. Feeling great before the tour.

The zoo is quite international with a lot of people waiting, but it was well-organized so that you didn't spend much time queuing outside.

The inside, I have to say that the speaker girl on tram is amazing. I love her introduction all the way, very interesting and dramatic. Thumbs up!

But the entire trip was kinda boring, because it was quite dark and you barely saw animals. A lot of deer on the way and they were lazy and tired......

The elephant is AMAZING. I love the elephant part!"
,,Safari tram,4.0,,Enjoyed every sight of the safari. The animals are not caged & you can see them live. Even the tram is not caged. Enjoyed watching the animals of different kind.
,,Walking trails are the best part.,4.0,,"There are two basic parts to the night safari: a tram ride, taking approximately 45 mins, with a tour guide explaining each of the animal exhibits; and self-paced walking trails. I would recommend taking the tram ride to get your bearings (the tram lines are long! but move relatively quickly), then walking back to see the animals you're most interested in as you get a much better view this way. The diving cats were far and away my favourite animals to watch!"
,,Night Safari,4.0,,The train trip was very good although the commentator was a bit over the top in her descriptions. An interesting concept going to the zoo in the dark. The walks were well laid out with plenty to see.
,,Short of spectacular,2.0,,"The night we visited, it was very very crowded. After being pushed every which way while standing in line to get in, we felt a bit of panic looking at our maps to figure out where to go first. My daughter really wanted to see the Tiger feeding, but after getting lost on the trail, we were five minutes too late. It's a neat idea, to see the nocturnal animals, but there wasn't much to see really and was short of spectacular. I would not recommend this to families with small children who wish to see the zoo animals but instead would go to the zoo during the daylight hours."
,,GK vastly improved!!!,5.0,,"What a place! Went for the Creatures of the nite show,which was very well done. Then took the tram ride & went thro' every type of forest & vegetation available on Earth. Met a lot of animals & birds too. The commentary was excellent too!"
,,Night Safari-Pooh,2.0,,"The night safari at the Singapore Zoo is a waste of money. Because very little light is used and you can be squashed on the people mover, you don't see a lot of animals unless they are huge.
There was one animal show that we wanted to see but we were told the seating area was full. Our guide allowed us to stay longer and catch the next show. It was geared to children but still entertaining.
There was also a short fire-eating performance. The fellows were full of energy and their performance was very good.
But as far as Zoos go, skip it."
,,Night Zoo- such fun!,5.0,,My family went to the Night Zoo while visiting Singapore--and loved it! Don't be discouraged by the crowd at the entrance. Lines moved quickly and then it was just fun to take the tram around. Afterward we walked the paths to see more animals up closely--like the Slow Loris--amazing!
,,A Great Place For Younger Kids,4.0,,"We had heard a lot about the Night Safari - Singapore's no.1 night tourist spot, but in some ways we were a little disappointed given all of the hype. For younger families, it could be a real buzz. The park itself opens at 7.30pm and closes at midnight, but the ""touristy area"" ... the retail shops & restaurants ... opens earlier around 5.30pm. An adult ticket costs S$39 and we purchased ours online to avoid the ticketing queues. The highlight was the ""guided tram tour"" (despite the length of the queue to get on) which takes about 40 minutes and travels through what they call ""7 geographical zones of the world"". I must admit the array and variety of animals that you see was impressive. The lighting around the zoo itself and the numerous walking tracks is very very subdued for obvious reasons. Unless you have a very expensive camera / lens for taking photos at night, then taking photos can be a bit of waste of time ... no flash photography is allowed."
,,Great Concept but hard to see,4.0,,"This a great concept and fairly good night out but be aware it is very hard to see the animals , I thought it would be a lot more open however the animals are in enclosures much like the zoo and in the darkness of the night it is hard to spot the animals at times . It does very very crowded here around opening so be aware . We had a good time here but by far enjoyed the zoo next door a lot more"
,,Interesting for young family,4.0,,"I did night safari when I was 20 (quite a long time ago). It was my first trip to Singapore. It didn't make much of an impression on me. I have since then been in Singapore a few times but didn't really have the desire to go back.
This time I went with my four-year old daughter and as a family we really enjoy it. We get to see animals which come from South East Asia, such as Malayan tapir, and at a close distance, too. The guide for the safari and the host for the Animal of the night show were both informative and bubbly. A well organised attraction."
,,Lots of animals-make sure you walk the trails not just the tram!,5.0,,"Wow! What a unique and awesome experience.
We got there on the later side so we were a little rushed but we took the tram ride first. it was a bit underwhelming - the guide points out animals tells cheesy jokes and gives some information about the animals. Its definitely worth going on it first to get a nice view of some animals you can't see on the walking trails.
Then walk the trails, we managed to walk all of them - they basically make a big loop. The major highlight is all the cats many of whom were quite active at night which is a cool experience.
Its also cooler at night which makes it a nice time to walk around and not feeling like you're sweating to death as is the case in many other Singapore attractions haha).
We saw nearly all the animals that there were to see except some of the smaller ones who were in big areas but expect to see lots!"
,,"Second time here, and still loving it...",5.0,,"I went with my parents (65+ y.o.) to the Night Safari as a gift to them. Obviously I can't take them to the walking trails as we have been walking around the whole day already. If you will be in a situation like me I suggest the following sequence of activities: (1st) Watch the Fire dancers, (2nd) the animal show at the amphitheater (3rd) and the Tram tour (4th) you can eat, or shop, or go back to your hotel (ha!) The Fire Dancers have a new trick, I'm glad they change them up. The host of the animal show is a very alive-alert-awake lady that greeted everyone ""good evening"" in different languages (I appreciate the effort). My parents loved it...but said later on they would really like to see it in the morning. Looks like another trip in the making then!"
,,it's okay if you missed this one,3.0,,"Visited night safari right after a trip to Singapore's impressive zoo. Had to wait in a long queue before they finally took us in. Attended a show before boarding a tram which takes you through path where you see animals almost places as if they are staged. Did not find it exciting, although it surely is a novel idea for a zoo."
,,Scary,5.0,,"We had gone to Singapore, so we decided to go for night safari. The place had shops and the music was exciting. First we went for the show in the amphitheater. It was cool. The animals performed tricks there. The place was well maintained. Then we went for the night safari in the buggie. The buggie had a speaker in which a lady was speaking. The music in the buggie was soothing. Venturing animals so close was awesome. Then we went for a walk in a tunnel. There were animals there you could see. What an experience."
,,something extraordinary,4.0,,"The Night Safari at Singapore is a place i recommend highly. The animal attractions are those that you wouldn't usually see at a normal zoo. If you sweat easily, bring an extra shirt.

Though Night Safari is a child friendly zoo, i suggest not bringing kids who are afraid of the dark or who are below 4 years old as some attractions could scare them."
,,a new experience,4.0,,"i'd never went to the zoo at night before. i've been to singapore many times but never had an idea to go to the night safari, this time when a friend persuaded me i decide to give it a try and i was glad i did. it gave a feeling of night adventurous while walking along the path and see the animals walk freely in the artificial forrest,especially the hyena.
the tram ride was also good and interesting. i think i like it. it was suitable for all ages."
,,A must see in Singapore,4.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari is a must see because it is quite unique and if I'm not mistaken, this was the first night safari in the world.
One thing you must do is go to the Creatures of the Night show. There are always a lot of people streaming into the amphitheater, so you are better off getting in early. There are shows on the half hour every hour, starting from 7:30.
After the show you must board the tram which will take you around the park and show you most of the exhibits.
Do keep quite when near the animals and do not use flash photography. This could be dangerous for the animals and for you as well.
You can do a few of the trails on foot as well and get closer to the animals."
,,One Highlight in Singapore,4.0,,"To get there, we took the bus 138 from the Ang Mo Kio train station and arrived at the Night Safari at 8pm on a Tuesday. Perfect timing to see the Creatures of the Night Show. The show was fun and entertaining. After the show we walked on all four trails first because the Tram line was endless.
Along the trails we saw so many interesting animals, from lions roaring out a concert, bears playing, two otters goofing, a tiger, a leopard...
Around 11 pm the park was already quite empty when we took the tram (we were the only two people) which is why we got the chance to see two tapirs very close to us. Even a wild unwanted python crossed our path.
We enjoyed watching so many active animals from that close and we would recommend it to all families. Start with the trails and take your time.
But it is still a zoo where animals are behind glass/ bars to be an attraction.
Also you should know that public transportation is not running anymore around midnight (weekdays)."
,,interesting attraction,4.0,,"Very cool excursion to be at a zoo at night. The tram allowed us to get in close proximity to the animals, just a pity that flash photography was not allowed, but certainly an attraction not to be missed in Singapore."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"You all have to go, it is just brilliant good value for money lots to see and yiu get up close to the animals. I particularly liked the snoring pigs on one of the little walks.

Would consider if suitable for babes in pushchairs as it is a long wait for the train ride round the safari and it seemed too much for young chikdrem"
,,Wonderful experience but a few pointers make it all the better!,4.0,,"This is a fantastic trip for children and able bodied adults alike, but there are a few things to remember to make it more memorable:
1. Don't eat in the park - the food is horrible and overpriced. Have supper before you go.
2. There is no need to arrive dead on opening time as the park doesn't close until midnight. In fact it's better if you don't as the crowds will have gone if you come at 8pm instead. There is even a later fire eating show so you won't miss that either.
3. Do the walking trails first the tram queue is huge early on in the evening but will be empty by 10pm.
4. Do wear mosquito repellant, inevitably there are a few about.
5. Don't join any of the bus tours, just grab a taxi from the city (cost about S$25), the bus tours are there to make money not enhance your enjoyment.
6. Approach all the animal enclosures quietly, the zoo keepers are generally close by and if they see you being respectful will encourage the animals closer with food."
,,not reaching expectations,3.0,,"i visited the river safari some weeks after visiting the singapore zoo. it's nothing to compare. the idea is interesting, but some choices are strange. if it's a water safari, why the monkeys? why the (very nice) pandas? the big tanks are well kept and personally you can see properly the fishes inside, but in most cases the pictures will have a lot of reflex. i don't know if during a night visit it's better."
,,Singapore night safari,2.0,,"Whilst I enjoyed finally seeing the animals, a lot of deer to be seen, the wait was no fun. Got there round 7pm to be shuffled to the tram tour and waited almost an hour in the heat before finally getting on the tram. Ride was ok,mi think it was maybe 1/2 hour if you're lucky, didn't stop long enough for us to really get a good look at the animals, if we saw them at all. Next time I'd do the walk trails and if time permitted get on the tram afterwards. Food very expensive, possibly eat before you go. This was our second trip to safari, first was just after it opened, and it's still as busy now!!"
,,If you have too.,3.0,,"We journeyed to this attraction on a tour that included dinner, we were picked up at hotel then bussed to Chinatown, hung around for 40 minutes then off. We would arrive at 730pm, to be offered a less than appealing buffet, that was sparse and offered little in palatability. With that done, off on the tram to view many a species that could not be seen. We walked one of the trails and that was a bit better.
My best suggestion, grab a map, walk the three trails and if you have time grab a tram at the end, eat b4 you go, then have a later supper when you return to Singapore.
Probably more exciting for the kids."
,,Loved this...saw animals I haven't even heard of!,5.0,,"I had heard so much about this before arriving in Singapore I was a bit sceptical thinking it would just be another zoo.... But I was wrong!

We didn't go to the zoo during the day so got the bus from outside our hotel to the zoo in the evening and were welcomed by a whole host of activity including fire shows.

We jumped straight onto the tram and began the tour round the zoo as the driver described all the animals. I liked the fact that you could jump off at certain stops to explore the trail in more depth if wanted. We saw animals we had never heard of and felt in some cases we got really close to the animals!

Despite quite out of the city we really enjoyed it and would recommend others to visit."
,,Have been before but would still go again,5.0,,"Went on a Saturday night and was crazy busy. Ate at Bongo Burgers (overpriced) because we wanted to see the 'fire dancers'.

2 adults (went there 10 years ago) and 5 year old loved it. The Creatures of the Night show was atmospheric and entertaining. We didn't remember the walking trails from our last trip and really enjoyed them. The lines for the tram were crazy until about 9.30pm, then they thinned out to nothing, so we hopped on one about 10pm, after the Creatures of the Night Show. A late night (11pm finish) for a little kid, but worth it.

Good value on a 3-in-1 park pass (available on the Night Safari website). Take a good look at the recommended itineraries on the Night Safari website, as no-one seems to, and following them will avoid the crowds. Once we entered the walking trails (ie. bypassed the crazy tram crowds), it felt like we had the place to ourselves. The 5 yo got a bit grumbly about the walking by the end (even though it was easy walking - no climbs etc - and quite compact) but you get a great view of lots of the animals (particularly the giraffes and zebras) on the walking trail (a better view than on the tram ride), and having that different perspective really gives you an appreciation of their size.

We took a taxi there and back to our hotel (near Bras Basah MRT station) because the bus options didn't seem convenient. The taxi queue was about a 15 - 20min wait at around 11pm. Cost of taxi was between SGD22 and 26 each way, so well worth it for the convenience, and took around 20 - 25 mins.

Recommend wearing insect repellent."
,,Enjoyable experience,3.0,,Certainly a different perspective on visiting a zoo. The hyenas looked as if there were stalking us in the tram which was both cool and a bit scary. Whilst the animals are obviously secure it didn't look like this which is the great thing about this zoo. I was on an organised trip so we didn't have the time to do all the walks and on a future visit I would DIY. Also had a meal at Bongo Burgers which was not that good to be honest - it might be best to eat before you visit and use the time do do the walks.
,,Singapore Zoo Night Safari - A Must Do!,5.0,,"We took 2 small children to the night safari at Singapore zoo mid week. We drove there with little traffic at 6.30pm and parking at the zoo was both ample and easy. There is a show on before dark with fire-breathing dancers, which we avoided because it scared the kids, which was only because they were so young. Otherwise the show is quite entertaining and it is in the entrance where the tickets are sold, food sold and souvenirs readily available.
The carriages start pulling out at 7.30, and although the queue was quite long we were were aboard and on our way quickly. The guide was clear and comprehensive and the animals were amazing.
We saw roaming rhinos, enormous hippos, giraffes dining on tall trees, a herd of elephants, howling wolves and tigers and lions performing rather than sleeping plus loads of other less memorable creatures. The kids loved it and so did we. We had a Ben and Jerry's ice cream on the way out and photos on the rhino and crocodile statues out the front. It was a fantastic night."
,,Animals at night - a unique experience,4.0,,"While you will be looking at most of the animals from afar (there were instances that you will only see shadow-like form, since it's dark), I still think it's still worth to give it a try. Our experience was an unforgettable one because when we were at the Leopard Trail, it was drizzling with some occasional lightning & thunder, and we couldn't help feeling a bit spooked because we have this strange feeling that the animals were hidden in the trees/bushes, watching us. Paranoid, i know. ;) We spent a good amount of time on the Walking Trails that we weren't able to catch the animal shows.

This was what we did and it might also help you to thoroughly enjoy the Night Safari experience: arrive on or before 6pm to grab an early dinner, be at the entrance by 7pm (queues could be quite long afterwards) to get the earliest tram rides. Once you're done with the tram ride, spend the rest of your time exploring the Walking Trails."
,,Completes the Zoo experience,5.0,,"If you have made it all the way out here for the zoo, you may as well stay for the Night Safari. The zoo closes at 6pm and Night Safari doesn't open until 7.30pm so there is a bit of a wait. Night Safari is a separate attraction - not just the previous zoo at night. You will get a new set of animals and trails to explore.
It pays to start queuing early. Skip the Creatures of the Night show at the entrance and get in that queue. You are herded onto electric trams which drive around the park, with a live commentary. It gets spoilt by people who don't turn their flashes off. If you have night vision on your camcorder use that to spot animals lurking in the dark. I does get very very dark.
The electric tram isn't obligatory and you can get off at a couple of stops and hop back on later. I recommend the Leopard trail where you walk through an enclosure of flying squirrels. The park is open until midnight, a taxi back to the city costs about $30."
,,Night Safari Singapore,2.0,,"My wife insisted on this one, in truth she will admit that it was a little tongue in cheek, the animals are hard to see and obviously it is dark so you end up seeing just dark shadows with the driver informing you of what these shadows are, in truth, go and see the zoo during the day to make it worth while, the night safari is not worth the taxi drive and ride costs."
,,Really enjoyed it,4.0,,"The show was really well done and we had a very informative tour guide, we really enjoyed this. Only regret of the night was not making it to the zoo in time beforehand"
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,"This is a fabulous experience that everyone enjoyed and we all felt was the highlight of our week in Singapore. What a fun and interesting way to see animals in their natural habitat at night time. There is more movement and the animal sounds are more obvious, especially the howling wolves.
A well run operation with two really great shows.
Try out the Fish Therapy where you sit with your feet/calves in a water tank and the fish nibble away.
We used our train/bus pass and this was easy and efficient.
A brilliant evening :)"
,,Small enclosures... sad to see,2.0,,It maybe a beautiful place for people to visit but all I could see was such small enclosures when they claim to have so muh space. The night safari was not great though the nocturnal show was good.
,,Absolutely overrated,1.0,,"I don't know what the fuzz is about this activity. We were totally disappointed. You don't see a whole lot - of course it is dark at night and the lights are dim to not disturb the animals. I am sure it is much nicer to visit the zoo at daylight. Really think about it - the city has so much other great things to offer.
Tip (if you think you have do do it anyway): Take a taxi and not the subway and bus. It cost about 30 Dollars, but saves you over one hour travel time."
,,Night safari lived up to the hype,4.0,,"Although in my humble opinion not as big as some other zoo in the big apple this night safari is a unique experience.
You ride a bus passing lions, tigers and other animals. So what is the big deal? Did I say the first ride doesn't start before dusk?"
,,Heaps of fun!,5.0,,This is much better than the day zoo - which is still a very good zoo. The main difference is that at night you don't notice the fences as much so it feels like there is nothing between you and the animals. Also the show at night is enjoyable for adults and children whereas the day shows are mainly target the kiddies.
,,Unique Experience!,5.0,,This is something that is really quite different and worthwhile while visiting in Singapore. Beware that the night safari is very popular and busy so try to get there before it opens for the evening! I would probably skip the night animal show the next time as I have seen much better and it isn't that long. Instead I would recommend focusing on the night ride through the park and afterwards spend some time walking around on the night paths to see different animals. Well worth the visit it!
,,A Night Full of Wonder...!!,5.0,,"Once you finish your visit to Singapore Zoo, right next to it is the Night Safari where all the nocturnal creatures come to play.
You can catch the Hunting cat live in action where it leaps for the fishes in the stream, or even watch the Hyenas laugh at you at their feeding time.
The best way to enjoy is to take a tram ride first mark all the points of interest and then explore by food on their walking trails.
Make sure you dont miss the entertainment shows as they add the light to the Night experience.
A must see for all old and young alike."
,,A little rushed,3.0,,We did this tour through Viator (East Tours) and while it was ok we felt rushed the whole time and didn't get to see everything. The tour guide was not overly friendly and at one stage we stopped and filled the bus to the brim with passengers from a broken down bus only to stop again 100 metres later to let them off. Singapore zoo is great and the night safari wonderful but there just wasnt enough time for any additional exploring.
,,Attentive and Excited,4.0,,"While in Singapore, besides numerous attractions, night safari does matter as well. Not to a great extent, yet it has its own importance particularly for the nature lovers. Without attending this attraction one may later feel having missed something. I did enjoy the creature of the night show , the fire eaters and ofcourse the night safari. The chanting and clapping from the tourist had its own impact. Night time ride in a tram coupled with the impressive commentary did create interest and one remains attentive and excited all the times."
,,Too Close to Nature !,4.0,,Extremely well thought and implemented quiet ride into the jungles in electric trams with live commentary. Wide range of animals to see in their natural habitats up close and personal. Well manicured surroundings and well maintained trails. Themed toilets !! Animal shows and multiple walking trails - lots to do on a pleasant evening in Singapore. Worth a visit !!
,,Really great experience!,5.0,,"Make sure you go just before sunset so you can see better. Made the mistake of going when it was dark which made it hard to see some of the animals. The unique experience of being so up close and personal with some of the animals was wonderful although we had some inconsiderate people behind us who spoke loudly and had their camera flash on despite myself giving them looks everytime.

Took the lion or leopard trail and saw a few rats across the running on the ground which creeped me out so much as they also had these big rats in the glass which made me think they escaped but there are rats wandering around so be careful.

If lighting and direction could be more clear about where to go that would have been better instead of thinking we got lost and wandered to the wrong side of the trails."
,,Crowded but enjoyable,4.0,,"We did the Night Safari on the same day as River Safari so it was a long day but worth it. We got there early as we were already there waiting for it to open and got in the queue for the first safari bus at 7.30pm so we could see the ""Creatures of the Night Show"" at 8.30pm. The staff are well organised and how they deal with some of the rude and pushy tourists I have no idea! How they remain polite when people are asked to turn off their flash and still insist on using it also impressed me. Don't try and take photo's while on the safari bus unless you have a good camera which copes with limited light source - I found the safari bus moved to quickly to capture photo's anyway. Just enjoy the experience and the commentary. Well worth a visit."
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,"You can ride on a bus or walk around and watch nightly creatures in their natural habitats - something we rarely get to observe. While not all the animals can be seen clearly (some are hiding), most are if you look carefully. Overall, it's a few hours of a unique nature watching experience when you sometimes feel like a guest in a wild forest. Make sure to visit a bat cave to watch beautiful fruit bats closely in their nightly activity. As its dark, picture taking is not easy and requires a very a good camera."
,,Really?,2.0,,"No fence or protection of the tourist car. In case any animals get mad, it seems to be dangerous. I remembered that the white tiger in Singapore zoo kill one staff in many years ago."
,,Something different,4.0,,"A zoo experience based on nocturnal animals is not totally novel, most zoos will have a 'Night House' or some such exhibit. However few are as large in scope as this. Now yes you have to accept you probably won't get any decent shots unless you have really good low light equipment, and yes you may not see all the animals but the ones you will see can be quite fun.

A number of options are available for this zoo and they often include transport from the CBD hotels. This is a good option though may not leave you with as much time as you'd like however it does take care of the distance between the main part of the city and the attraction itself.

Plenty of amenities and as usual for Singapore, spotlessly clean."
,,Superb .....Different experience,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. Its a different experience watching those animals after dark. You will love it extremely, if you are an animal lover. Do not miss the 2 shows. Worth watching ."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Not quite what I expected but is a different experience and worth a visit.
You can do the tram ride and also walk around the trails yourself. Certain animals you will only see by doing 1 of the other so allow time to cover both of these. The creatures of the night show was fun and entertaining, gets busy though so worth getting there 15/20mins before the show starts to get a seat.
There is no flash photography allowed for obvious reasons so it can be quite hard to get good pictures without decent night mode/night camera."
,,Great place to see,5.0,,"It was fabulous experience to see the fire show at the beginning. Later we got on the tran, almost everybody follow the same way, because it took you to make around the whole area and see wild animals, weird thing is, the lion and tiger were not seized properly in the cage but openly moving around. oops~~~ er scary~~"
,,Pity about the tour company,2.0,,"the zoo is great.well set up. If you do not like being treated like cattle in the typical tourist type lines and fake approach to nature this is not for you.

We have done trekking through the jungle in Malaysia and after that these types of tourist parks are always disappointing.

The tour operator was very bad. bus broke down, second bus windscreen wipers did not work. The english spoken by the guide was very poor and we could not understand any of the instructions. when we arrived at the destination the guide took off and we had no idea where we where meant to go.

The tour company was Tour East Singapore"
,,Great time,5.0,,The night safari was excellent. Seeing animals so close was a great way to enjoy the time. My kids enjoyed this a lot. Best point you sit and enjoy rather than walk.
,,"Very interesting, and we saw just about every animal! Would take others again!",4.0,,"Some people have written reviews claiming the tram goes too fast round the animals but actually we walked through the place first and saw the majority of the animals on foot, then did the tram which was much quieter! We had a great time and would definitely recommend it to others. Our reason for saying 4/5 is mostly because some of the animals were pacing or weaving, which tells us they were bored and required more space or enrichment."
,,Great night time adventure!,5.0,,"I'm not a zoo person, but I was blown away by this attraction. So many different animals, and our tram guide was very knowledgeable. I would definitely go back!!"
,,great for all the family,5.0,,We visited on a busy Easter Saturday but it was still quick to get on the tram. The food outlet (Bongo Burgers!) was very quiet although the nearby fire-eaters were just finishing as we sat down. The animals were great but it was a pity we didn't get to see the leopard as we had done previously. The queue for the taxis took about forty minutes at the end of the trip. Worth booking one if you know how to do this - we didn't!
,,Nighty night,5.0,,"This thing is definitely one of its kind. Every trip of mine to Singapore has meant, a trip to this famed place too. First time round, I was a bit skeptical about roaming in the tropical setting at night, but then I did overcome the feeling and was able to enjoy the wonders the place had to offer. This is a must visit, for anyone visiting Singapore. You do not want to miss out on the penchant of natural beauty in Singapore. You better take the pictures in the Zoo in the day time, the trail does not allow you to turn on your flash."
,,Very nice and safe attraction,5.0,,"Very nice for the kids and adults, but you cannot take good pictures because flash light is not allowed."
,,Great experience with very knowledgeable guide,4.0,,This is definitely worth a visit. Great to see the animals at night but sometimes you pass by them too quickly. Took a tour but recommend going on your own during the day so you can walk all the different paths.
,,Concern for the animals,1.0,,"We went to the Night Safari this week, having heard that it was one of the best things to do in Singapore. I should have thought a bit more about it. I don't like zoos, but the word safari suggested wide open spaces where the animals could roam free separated from visitors by moats. What I saw were many animals exhibiting the sort of disturbing behaviour seen in zoos - the elephant stood still swaying its head and was in exactly the same place doing the same thing an hour later. A tiger was pacing back and forth for about 20 metres in its enclosure. We went on the tram tour and then an hour late took it to get back to the entrance. The enclosures looked like tableaux of what we had seen an hour earlier. Surely you would have expected them to have moved more? None of our party of 4 (3 generations) will recommend this. Don't go if you are at all concerned with animal welfare. If you love zoos however and don't care about animal welfare, you will love it. It is well organised and there is lots to do for the family."
,,Experience the Singapore Safari,5.0,,"Great experience in a cosmopolitan city. Here you return to ""nature"" carefully preserved within a city of sky-scrapers. You enjoy fresh air without the buzzling noises of city traffic. Animals from all over the globe can be found here."
,,Possibly one of the finest most Humane zoo's in the world,5.0,,"The night safari is trul worth a visit,just remember to give a quick spray of mozzie repellant and you will be amazed..)"
,,Night tour,4.0,,"Take the night tour option but don't wait for the tram, follow the Fishing Cat trail..they're brilliant...then the Leopard Trail before getting on the tram. The queues will have disappeared and you can enjoy the rest of the tour. Excellent taxi transfers to and from the coach and all round good value."
,,Night safari a great experience,5.0,,"I went on the night safari with my family. A great experience, original and very interesting. Worth while visiting, good attraction."
,,Advanture at night,4.0,,"First time going to a night safari! definitely had a great time! i suggest to purchase ticket ahead of time/ purchase the package, so you get to visit the river safari, zoo and the night safari. i think kids will definitely have so much fun here (only if they can stay up late!) beside suggesting for family, i would also recommend this to friends and couple. this is something different and you get to experience the nature in a very different way. for a city girl like me, i LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,Its a great experience. The night safari has an exceptional concept. All the animals are kept in captivity with their own environment. Zones are divided into different zones as the world. Highly recommended.
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,Starting time is 7.30pm. I can say reach on time then only u can enjoy fully. u can see lot animals by sitting in vehicle and have walking tracks.nice restaurants inside. expensive but worth it 39 sing dollars. go as a couple u enjoy more.
,,Save your money,2.0,,"Reading so many phoney reviews to buff up the safari's impression. How would these people even know the lights are special and in depth details of the prices and saying in Sales pitch type lingo!!?? Amusing but pathetic way. All in all I find this zoo is a great way to part anyone from their hard earned cash. Sorely overpriced! And do not eat there, it will cost you sgd25++ for a plate of rice (heavens! it's just food!!) onwards on top of the high high entry fees. Animals were lacking too topped with fake speakers blasting noises to scare tourists into believing its real. HOw's that for gimmick!"
,,Well managed experience,4.0,,Great for family/kids. Very maintained. Shows are good. Overall good way to spend 3-4 hours in Singapore.
,,Experience natural animals setting at night,5.0,,"We first saw the Thumbuakar Performance at the entrance which was amazing rhythmic and fire eating show at 6:45 pm. Next inside we immediately went to see the Creatures of the Night Show which introduces us to many facts about the animals and also teach us to recycle goods and make environment more friendly for humans and animals alike.

Next we took a tram ride and got down at the next stop to see the white cheetah. Then we hopped on the tram again and completed a full circle of the park.

Overall this park offers a great experience of nocturnal animals in a unique natural settings at night."
,,great experience,5.0,,you can enjoy the night safari sitting on a tram and looking around how the animals are living there. it was not like a zoo with cages. the zoo was really different. like a jungle where the animals are free
,,Great zoo but go at night,4.0,,"During the 90 deg heat of the day, this is a challenging place to go. After 6.30pm however, it is a different proposition. Although still very humid, the night safari (as it is called) shows animals in a natural nocturnal setting. Great value for money."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"The planning of the entire route of the night safari simply amazing.
You can take several route with clear signs and instruction on the map. Also, if you tired to walk the route, you can wait at the intersection and get yourself into the shuttle bus (vice versa).
The amphitheater show is not to be missed with cute animals performing.

Take note of the feeding animals time, you at least can see the active part of the animals because some of them tend to be lazy and tired at night.

Overall night safari offers a different view of animals at night and no worries for the hot sun and sweaty feeling.

You always can buy the package for 3 spots, the Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari and finish in one goal, if you are not tired :)"
,,It's OK for the youngsters,2.0,,"The actual safari was ok, unable to photo animals unless you have night camera......no flashes allowed. Children will love seeing exotic animals but as adults only visiting don't think it is worth the money.to see all the shows ,tram ride and cat swishing walk you need longer than the arranged tours give you."
,,Fab idea,4.0,,What a fantastic idea! We did the zoo and night zoo on the same day as they are quite far out of the city. We first went to the animals of the night show which was excellent. Then we got the 45 min tram ride round the zoo. Animals are free to roam and are not caged - they stay back due to well constructed natural barriers - great to see in a more natural environment. You are then free to walk about. It is very dark - and don't forget bug spray!
,,fun safari for kids..,3.0,,Good experience and definitely worth a visit.. You are given a buggy ride to take you around with a guide..you can jump off at drop point take a stroll and visit the enclosures..once you are done walking on foot you can jump on another buggy to continue your tour..in all there are three drop and pick up points..the safari gives you both in car as well barefoot experience. However this is controlled environment hence not very thrilling..put the place on secondary list if you are facing time crunch
,,Excellent trip. But turn off flash photography if you go,4.0,,"We had a wonderful night doing this and organised our visit through a tour group. Picked up on time and very clear instructions on where to meet, how to plan our visit etc. we enjoyed the safari, but could not believe the idiots who insist on using flash photography and ignore the train drivers and then get annoyed when asked to tour flashes off. It does get hard to hear the commentary when you have groups of other travellers who prattle away loudly during the commentary. This is a learning experience for many but some don't want to learn. Some amazing animals. Do this if you can."
,,Night safari expensive,3.0,,"While the kids loved the night safari, the cost of $160 for 3 adults and 2 kids was a bit surprising however, we saw all the animals and it was very informative."
,,Fun Night,5.0,,"Amazing place to be in, was there with friends lovely animals and he train ride was just amazing, i saw children having more fun obviously, a must go place for kids while growing.
food was also good we had in one of the African restaurants inside the night safari and the food was fairly tasty."
,,Great tram ride,4.0,,"First of all, it takes longer than you might expect to get to the Zoo area from the city center. We came from Bugis station and it took 1,5 hours to get to the Night Safari. The bus from Ang Mo Kio (if I remember the name correctly) station takes 35-40 minutes, and we had to wait the bus for 15 minutes. I think it's faster and not that much more expensive to take the tourist bus, and it saves you from the hassle.

The safari was great, we took the tram ride twice because the first time we missed the hippos. It is nice to walk around also, but the tram was excellent with a guide in the front telling some basic information about each animal.

Also, remember to bring some snacks with you because even if you have eaten well before the safari you will be hungry when you are leaving. The only place in the Zoo area that was open after 11pm was an ice cream bar and I would have wanted something salty instead."
,,Interesting night away from the city - Worth a visit,4.0,,"Night safari, located beside Singapore Zoo, we booked a package which included transport and it was excellent. Tram ride in the dark through the zoo, takes around 40 minutes, there is one stop that you can get off the tram and go on a 30 min walking trail to see other animals and then get back on the tram. Two other trails also available which are shorter, but just as interesting. Tribal show around 9pm. Restaurants at the zoo, the food is excellent and reasonably priced for the attraction. Fantastic attraction and would definitely visit again."
,,An Amazing and a Thrilling Experience,5.0,,"Night Safari, located just beside Singapore Zoo and River Safari, is one of the most important things to do in SIngapore. Regardless of the season, weekend or week days, there is always a big rush for Night Safari. It is better to book package tickets for the complete wild life experience. The first show starts at 7.30 pm and the entry starts at 7.00. When we went recently in the first week of April, we had chosen the first ride at 7.30 but there was quite a good day light, nevertheless, not at all disappointing. However, a little late ride when there is pitch dark outside, would provide a better experience of watching wild animals in their nocturnal behavior. We could see many animals including lion, elephants, leopards, rhino, and many more while riding in the Tram that slowly drives past the wild animals. About 45 minutes ride is worth its value."
,,Good For evening Viewing,4.0,,On Fridays and Saturdays Singapore Zoo has what it calls night Safari. You are allowed into the zoo after dark and can travel on a quiet tram in near darkness seeing the animals. Whether it is because its dark or cooler they seem more active. In certain areas with the less dangerous animals you find yourself riding through and area which is completely unprotected. You can also walk certain paths at night. From my perspective the animals were more active than in a daytime zoo so it was a good trip. There is food available out there but it is expensive and average
,,Something different,4.0,,"To go to a zoo at night is a new experience, and very interesting. There were queues for the tram, but one did not have to wait long, and once on board you could see a great deal in a short time. After the tram we did the walking trail, where one can get a closer and longer look at the animals, the highlight of which was seeing the lions fed.
In brief an interesting night out and one I will remember.
TIP. If you wish to visi,t ask your hotel to arrange for a tour company to take you, they will collect and return you to the hotel and I would imagine, no more expensive than going it alone"
,,A great experience,5.0,,"Went here while on a business trip to Singapore, as we had a free evening. Was a lovely experience. The animals were up close and we saw nearly every animal on the tram ride. The commentary was very clear and interesting without too much detail.
Didn't have any children with us but hope to take our child there one day if we are in Singapore."
,,Awesome Fun !!,5.0,,Went to the night safari with great expectations...the locals told me a lot about the trails and the creatures of the night !! As soon as i arrived i was greeted by breath taking performance by the Thumbuakar troupe.It was like the animals were told exactly what to do when they see us !! little surprised .. still awesome place !!! A Must-Must in every travelers itinerary.
,,Great Fun,5.0,,Went to the night experience with dinner and had a great time. Dinner was very good and it was cool that the animals seemed to know that they should perform for us!
,,Average,3.0,,"Our last tour in Singapore ended a little dissapointing. After all the wonders of Singapore the night safari was unimaginative and dull, we saw very little and the displys were basic for Singapore pride. The dinner at Ullu ullu however was very good."
,,100% Recommended and it was nice and cool when we went :),5.0,,"We loved this place, because it was a cool evening it was so comfortable to enjoy everything. When we arrived about 6.15pm we were greeted by handlers holding some animals, one of which I can't recall what it's called, but was gorgeous and later is part of the show. We got something to eat at a cafe and sat at a table closest to the stage for the Fire Show. The 2 guys were fantastic and put on an amazing show, so make sure not to miss them. As soon as that finished u are able to go in and we immediately lined up for the tram. Excellent setup, so well organised and even thou there were lots of people there were also lots of trams. So it flows beautifully, well it did when we were there :) We opted to stay on the tram for the entire journey, but there are options to get off if u wish...but not necessary IMHO. The drivers talk and are very good, and the trip goes on for quite awhile. The breeze on the night was very cooling which was a bonus. After the tram u follow the crowd and go to a amphitheater to watch the animal show. It was excellent, and thoroughly entertaining. Afterwards we followed the crowd again and there were more food stalls open if u wanted a drink or food. On leaving, the fire show was on again, so we watched it again and it was different to the 1st show. Amazing! Out of the Zoo and the River Safari, we liked this place. The coolness definately was better, so this is only our opinion...but I dooo love those pandas at the River Safari, haha. We found the zoo, too hot to enjoy it all."
,,Who is looking at who?,3.0,,"This was quite interesting but worked out to be an expensive evening. We were travelling independently with another couple so took a taxi. A long drive but still a good price compared to London taxi prices......about £15 for a 40 minute drive. Entrance fee was about £20 and the tram ride was about 30 minutes long. To be honest it was not very impressive and most of the wildlife looked as lethargic as in the daytime. We were offered the opportunity to walk through parts of the trail but would you? in the dark? i thought they were joking! how to end up as the lion's dinner!
The food outlet at the end of the tour was ok and then another long taxi ride back into the city. Would not recommend this unless you are completely dotty about wildlife!!"
,,Same animals in a day zoo,3.0,,"My partner had heard about the night safari and as soon as we booked a holiday to Singapore, she said she wanted to do it. We were both pretty disappointed. It seemed to be the same animals you see in a zoo during the day, but it was night time. We thought it was a little expensive and the long lines weren't worth it. If we had our time again, we would have gone to the zoo next door during the day."
,,"It's a zoo, not a safari",4.0,,"I guess I should have expected it, but this is really a night zoo, not a safari. The animal habitats seem way too small to me, and I had an uneasy feeling that the critters were really short on space, like in any zoo. The upshot is that you will see PLENTY of non-wildlife. The quantity and variety of animals on ""display"" (they really are on display) is fantastic, and they are almost all visible and active, due to the small size of the habitats (they can't really hide much). It's an eerie feeling to be walking through a tropical rainforest with lions roaring close by and the rest of the jungle sounds. If you have a moral issue with zoos, and you like wild animals to be in the wild, skip it. Otherwise, it's a must see for everyone, especially the little ones.
TOP TIP: do NOT join the queue for the tram when the place opens. You will wait and wait and waste your times, at least on weekends. It's not obvious, but you can start by doing the walking tour, then do the tram tour after the first wave has passed. The shows can be missed for most, except perhaps kids. The animals are trained and domesticated, they show you tricks, not a lot of them, and the presentation is really geared to kids and simple minds. It's short, about a half hour, but if you want to see it you will have to come to the queue early, which will make you waste time. I recommend doing the walking and tram tours and skipping the show; you'll see the animals anyway."
,,loved this place,5.0,,"Had perfect weather for our visit to the night safari. The tram ride was really good. The kids loved it. Was great being able to get off at different stops to explore, then get back on the tram for next spot. So not to much walking for the kids. Heaps of different animals to see and beautiful gardens to walk around."
,,Nice and different experience!,4.0,,"We (a couple, we're both 25) went to the Safari with quite high expectations. We took the MRT+bus to get there and thought it was well worth the money. We payed 4 dollars each in total so taking a taxi would have been much more expensive. Besides, we got to see a bit more of the country that way :-)
We arrived at about 18.30 and bought the tickets there, 39 dollars each (for the night safari only). As soon as the doors opened at 19 we went inside and headed towards the train ride. It was a good choice - we didn't have to stand in line for long. After that we had a quick dinner (one noodles with duck and one rice with duck) and I have to say that the food was extremly overpriced but at least it tasted good. After that we walked the 4 trails (it's actually just one walk) and then we saw the last creatures of the night show. Good thing it was friday and there was an extra show at 22.30 because we actually had to hurry a bit at the end of the walk to make it to the show! Maybe we were just slow, but we started the walk at 20.30 and wanted to secure seats to the show so we went there at 22 when they opened the gate. After the show we took the train again to see the animals one more time. We left when the Safari closed at 00. There was no MRT at that time anymore so we took a taxi and to the Gaylang area (Sims avenue) the ride was 26 dollars.
It was a fun night! :-)"
,,Tram ride in animal world,4.0,,"The Night Safari in Singapore zoo is a must-visit for visitors to this island. The rush is HUGE, but managed well. It is slightlly pricey at $37 for the less-than-an-hour sojourn. After almost an hour's wait in unending queues, one can board a tram that takes one through the zoo, with the guide introducing the inhabitants. The lions, Malayan tiger, rhinos and hippos, among others, in their nocturnal mode are an interesting sight.
After the safari, there are enough eating huts for an enjoyable dinner (though food des tend to run out by 10pm). Transport to the city is also easily available."
,,"Fantastic, well worth the money!",5.0,,"It's a bit of a trip out of the city to get here but well worth the journey! Make sure you don't only take the tram ride, there's plenty of other things to do including a number of different shows and walks. You get very close to the animals and they seem so much more alive at night time than they do during the day in a zoo. A must when in Singapore!"
,,Night Safari was excelent,5.0,,"Riding the trolley through the animal enclosures was superb - the sounds of the lions roaring and the hyenas laughing in the dark was a little unsettling and made the whole thing very real. The show was good too.
Not cheap, so good to maximise your time here.
There was a shuttle bus from Orchard Road at the end of Scotts - a v reasonable S$5 each"
,,Expensive and ride went too quickly,2.0,,"Our first night at Singapore and unfortunately this experience was disappointing. Due to the fact the bus ride was an hour long, and the tickets were quite expensive for not much to see. Don't get me wrong, there are some animals there, but the ride pretty much flew by the animals leaving no time to let you admire them, take pictures. It was a shame, as there could've been great opportunities. S$96 for two of us for 2 hours worked out quite expensive for us. Plus the food were very expensive at around S$50 for 2 meals and 2 drinks. Now the rest of my holiday is on bread and water!"
,,Something a bit different,5.0,,We booked through a tour company but it would be just as easy to get a cab (really good value) and buy tickets on line. Very busy at weekends and public holidays. Go on the tram to see some animals that you can' tree by walking and to get your bearings. Make sure you leave plenty if time to do the four walks. We were lucky enough to get very close to the tigers and clouded leopards. A great experience and cheaper than going on an actual safari!
,,Night Safari and zoo - nice twist on the usual zoo experience.,4.0,,"We took the night visit and safari as we had never done a zoo at night - highly recommended.
The tour started with a ride round all the enclosures - after dark - we were really close up to many of the animals. After the tour we did all of the walking trails around the zoo where you can get even closer to the animals and as it is night you will see flying foxes - but only if you look up! and flying squirrels - quite a unique experience. Give yourself plenty of time you will need it. There is also a fire eating show and an animal show which you will need to get to early as spaces are limited. Plenty of food and drinks outlets all good and reasonable prices.
We took a taxi from Orchard Road about $$20 - return same price. The bus is only $$5.
Tip:- wait for the rush to subside and actually enter the zoo nearer 7.45 - 8.00."
,,well worth it,5.0,,"our hotel advised us to take a taxi as opposed to public transport and they were right.$16 singapore dollars out and $20back was good value.the shuttle bus for the return was $6 and had heap of stops.
we followed the itinery guide from the website which we think is the best way to get around.
We got there at 6 and left at 10 which was plenty of time.
Everything was great from the fire show at the beginning to the tram ride at the end.we saw lots of animals and most were moving around.the creatures of the night show is really good but first come first seated so get there early
This is a must see and the only negative is that the food and drink is a little expensive"
,,Great evening - worth the visit,5.0,,"After mixed reviews I was sceptical - but the kids 5&8 were keen. It was fantastic, all the animals were moving around, and it was nice to be doing something of an evening out of the heat. It is a unique experience and one not to missed. Take your time, we got there at 630, and the girls had enough by 10 as they were tired- but I could of kept going. The night show was also very good."
,,Organisation troubles,2.0,,"The night started ok with a prompt coach pickup but then it took about 50 minutes to get to the safari which left only 2 hours until the return coach journey. Was that going to be enough? We soon found out as the queues in were horrendous . Most were aiming to go on the safari ride around the zoo, which we might have done also but for those wanting to go their own way it was tough as you still had to wait in the queue. It took 40 minutes to get to the start and as time was running out we passed on the ride and rushed round about half the zoo barely stopping to look at the animals.
We were disappointed as it wasn't cheap and I can barely remember an animal that we saw. We rushed back only for the last coach to be delayed so we ended up queuing for another 45 minutes for the trip back to Marina Bay.
In hindsight this was not the best use of our limited time in Singapore.
I am sure this is one of the top attractions but for us the organisation and inflexibility together with time constraints left us cold"
,,A unique experience,4.0,,"The journey begins with an African style dance and fire show called Thumbuakar Performance just outside the entrance. They make the show really interesting by involving the audience and with some fun acts. This 15 min show takes place just before the park opening at 7:00pm and thereafter every hour. Once you enter the gates you have the choice of going straight on the Safari or watch another show called Creatures of the Night. This 20 min show starts at 7:30PM and every hour thereafter. I would rate this one pretty average… kids may still enjoy the show.

The safari is done on battery operated trams and at times the queue for the tram can be quit long. The tram takes you around on a 40 min guided tour across seven geographical zones inside the park… as you move around you will spot different variety of nocturnal animals wondering free inside the park… of course the dangerous ones are separated by trenches so that they don’t come too close to the tracks. I would have liked it more to see the wild ones from close quarters. Apart from the tram ride there are some 3 or 4 walking trails… you follow a guide on foot to get an up close and personal view.

Outside the park there is a large circulating area with lots of restaurants and gift shops. The Singapore Zoo and River Safari are also at the same place. You can plan a whole day for all the three attractions or at least the zoo and night safari… Combo ticket for Zoo and Night Safari Is S$60.80 and all three is S$78.85. There is no direct MRT link to the zoo… you have to take the MRT to Ang Mo Kio MRT station and from there bus no. 138 for the zoo. The bus interchange is right opposite the MRT station.

Overall a unique and enjoyable experience…"
,,An amazing place and well worth a visit,5.0,,"Arriving at the night safari one can hop on a very quiet tram with a guide or opt to walk the trails (or, as we did, do one then the other). The concept is fairly straightforward: one passes through various ""zones"" (rainforest, African, Asia) and encounters animals along the way. What one is not prepared for is that the animals -- with certain obvious exceptions -- appear to be wandering free (they are not, of course, but it is very well done). So, deer and other small ""wild"" animals appear right by the side of the tram. Others -- lions, hyenas, buffalo, etc. -- are only just further away across ditches. Only a few animals -- tigers, etc. -- are clearly penned. Given that it is dark, the effect is mesmerising as soft lights fall on various animals silhouetted against their backdrops. We did not have our children with us on this trip, but if were to come back to Singapore with them, this would be top of the list of things to do.
The tram journey is well worth it -- and the ecological message although delivered a bit clumsily is important -- but don't miss out on walking the trails. By doing the one then then the other, one can see the animals up close when walking having been given the information about them on the tram.
It wasn't busy when we were there (March and the forecast was for rain), but looking at the queueing system it looked as if it was set up for a lot of people. In that case, it might be worth reversing the order (walking first and then taking the tram) as most people seem to head straight for the tram on arrival.
There are plenty of places to get food at the entrance, but we did not try them. A taxi out there from the city centre costs around 25 Singaporean dollars, and you can also get there by a combination of Metro and bus."
,,Very Fun! Lots of animals,5.0,,"The night Safari in Singapore is just outstanding! Recommended, especially for families with children from eight years and older. Can also be a romantic adventure. Very much fun, and a special experience. Well recommended"
,,Nigt trail by Tram and Walk,4.0,,"Be set for a wild night. Carry a camera that can click good quality pics in very low lights. You are not allowed the put the flash which annoys the wild animals. Trail on foot to see leopard, malayan tigers,fishing cats"
,,A must for Singapore visit,4.0,,If you are planning to visit Singapore this is a must. Such a beautiful organised place. They take you on a safari and it looks like you are so close to the animals still you are very safe. Went with my family and its so amazing to see the crowd there. Liked the animal show also. The respect they have for these animals is amazing
,,Enjoyable experience,4.0,,"Our family enjoyed the night safari. Make sure to take the tram tour a little later in the evening, when the nocturnal animals are more active. We walked the entire trail as well. There are some animals that were difficult to see or asleep, but overall most of the animals were up and about. The fire show at the entrance was not that great, so I would avoid it."
,,A.MAZ.ING,5.0,,"A friend and I have just walked in the door from our evening at the Night Safari and can't stop talking about it. We have both been travelling the world for over 6 months and both said that this was one of the best things we have done!

You get so close to the animals as there are no real cages so you feel like you are in their natural habitat and being on the tram makes it feel just like you are in a jeep on a safari through the serengeti national park!

You can easily fill the whole evening here :) if you get there before the park opens there is a fire show abour 6.45pm which is also worth watching!

All in all it is a defo must see!"
,,Waste of time & money,2.0,,"Very disappointing visit. On the tram ride the guide was very patronising which would have been OK if it had been full of 5 year olds. Pot luck as to whether you see anything but it is very apparent that no matter how well they disguise it - and they do it well - all the animals are in pens & not very big ones at that. For £20pp we felt that we were ripped off by about £19pp. To say that this is supposed to be Singapore's no1 attraction it can only be rated by the amount of money it takes. The Singapore Flyer & Marina Bay Sands Skypark are breath taking & far, far better value.
We walked a couple of the trails & although they were better than the tram ride they were still very disappointing.
The night time animal show they put on was just as patronising &disappointing.
All in all save your money & spend it on something you can look back on & smile about."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Our visit here only involved riding the tram and walking down the fishing cat trail. It was pretty short but enjoyable nonetheless. The ""cages"" (for the lack of a better term) we practically open so it was thrilling when we passed by the pack of lions lazing around. What disappointed me was the lack of ""nighttime experience"" where in we'll see the activities of nocturnal animals. Maybe I was expecting too much but it's not all that different from day zoo: just visiting the zoo during the night. Anyway, I wish we could've stayed longer and saw a lot more by following more trails (aside from riding the tram). Still a must visit attraction."
,,Great fun for big and little kids,4.0,,"I don't normally like the types of show where animals are made to run around etc but this one was really entertaining with an eco friendly message. The actual trip around the park on small trams was very good and we saw a surprising number of animals, all being far more active than during a hot sunny daytime visit."
,,Night safari,5.0,,"A must for adults and kids take a cab buy your ticket note seniors go half price we missed that one, it's open till 12 at night but get there for 7.30 and watch fire show then take the train then catch the animal show."
,,Go on the night safari,5.0,,"This is a very unique experience. You go on a tram that takes you thru the zoo at night to see animals that are nocturnal. Because Singapore is hot, the evenings are more pleasant to visit . It's both fun and creepy to get off the tram and walk the paths in the dark. There are lots of attendants so you don't get lost."
,,Properly Fun,5.0,,"Proper Singapore fun. Well organised, entertaining with lots of lovely food in case you come over hungry at short notice."
,,Very disappointed,2.0,,"Was very excited about this unique opportunity to travel around a zoo at nice and perhaps see animals (especially nocturnal animals) in a more active state than might otherwise be possible during a ""traditional"" day tour around a zoo. In the end, the tour was constantly disrupted by the noises of the tour guide/tram driver and we saw very few animals. DO get off the tram and walk around if you do this tour. And, BTW, a day tour of the Zoo is much better!"
,,Must Try Night Safari here,5.0,,"You must try Night Safari here, Unique of its kind . Animal appear so close that sometimes you get scare . a totaly different experience"
,,Fun evening activity,4.0,,"If you have issues with zoos, then you may not enjoy this, as it is basically a zoo, and not a safari. That being said, I quite enjoyed myself. You can choose to walk or take a tram, and both have their charms."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We were surprised we had to queue for the tram as we had booked a tour, but it was only 15 minutes. Saw quite a lot in half an hour. Try to do the leopard walking trail about 8:30 as it was feeding time. Food court was very good (especially the Indian)"
,,Can't compare with African safari,3.0,,After seeing safaris in Africa this one looked more like a zoo.It is meant for children upto 8/9 years old. Most of the animals were inactive and looked as if they were drugged. Don't waste your time unless you have got small children.
,,Very Good,5.0,,"If you are a fan of animals and would like to see them from very near, then this is MUST visit place for you. However keep in mind that this is very far from singapore city and you might have to plan this well. It starts in night at 7 pm and can go on till 12 pm. You can however come out as and when you want.

They take you on tram ride which will close to 45 mins. You can get down in between at 1 place and can walk as well, which i strongly recommend. We took the tram ride, saw the animals and then we walk again and saw them for more time. We are lucky to see 6-7 asian lions from very near and leopard, tiger, elephans and many other animals.

So for animal lovers, this is MUST. This has a fee and i suggest you to take a combo offer mixed with river safari or singapore zoo so you can cover multiple things at little less cost.

Also keep in mind of the timings as river safari closes at 5 pm and night safari stars only at 7 pm.. If you are late by 5, then you cannot get into river safari."
,,"It is unique, but not special",3.0,,"Since I live in Orlando, FL, USA, I know I am a bit jaded on theme parks and such, but the kids insisted we needed to see the night safari (and several recommendations).

We arrived via a $25USD taxi from south Singapore and then paid approximately $90USD to get the four of us in. We were starving, so we got burgers at the burger place there. I actually got to enjoy a lamb burger, which is unique to me. The food was good.

We then entered the park and had to PAY for the tram that goes around the park. I though this a bit odd considering the admission price. Whatever.

We went on several trails to see the animals. The one that sticks out the most was the ""fishing cat"" exhibit that STUNK of urine. Cat urine. I am guessing that one of the cats feel insecure.

My teenager was super excited to see the slow loris, her favorite animal in LIFE! He was moving about and that was nice.

The majority of the park is deer-like creatures with a tiger or lion thrown in. Overall, taking into account that I HAVE seen plenty of ""safari-type"" parks, I wouldn't go back, but it worth a first peek."
,,A different experience,4.0,,"It's a bit different to see the animals at night. But don't expect them all to be up and active. Many were no more active than they are in the daytime.

The tram ride is a must, but do try the walking trails too, especially the fishing cat trail.

Queues for the tram get long so do this first. Don't expect to get good photos unless your camera is very good at night shots - no flash is allowed.

The meal included in my tour was good value, but there's not really time to eat and see everything (if you want to do all four of the walking trails and the tram)."
,,"A unique experience, well executed",4.0,,"Never come across anything similar to this. The concept is that you see animals that you would never normally see as they are most active at night. Well that was true, but you also see loads of Japanese tourists during the day! The tour and commentary were very good and it was well worth the entrance fee."
,,Excellent Night Out,4.0,,This was an unusual trip. A night out at the Zoo. After a fire eating show we took a tram ride and saw nocturnal animals in their rainforest. They were really close.
,,Best of the three zoos,5.0,,"We visited the Night Safari after a long day of walking around the River Safari, and the Singapore Zoo. This was easy to do since the parks are located right next to each other. Overall, the Night Safari was the highlight of our day. It's a unique park that opens at night, which provides a totally different experience than a zoo by day. The animals, and not to mention the people, act differently. The atmosphere is really unique and interesting. First we went on a tram ride around the park, which was fun as the guide was quite into the role and explained a lot even though not all animals were visible. Afterwards we walked around all sections of the park, while it seemed crowded we were often just by ourselves which added to the experience. Special lights are placed to spot animals, and we even saw the clouded leopard which was the highlight for me. Overall I'd say from the zoos this one was the best. Great atmosphere, interesting animals and the way to experience was amazing. Highly recommend this."
,,Best zoo in world,5.0,,Nice zoo to visit with whole family. Specially Tram ride over their is just awsum. Infact you will love to watch the night show over their.
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"This was a different experience because you see nocturnal animals. You ride a open air train through, it takes 40 minutes. You can also walk the trails. It is quite crowded so get there by 7 p.m. It does cost to get in but is quite a different zoo experience."
,,Night Safari,3.0,,"Well maintained, but the trill was missing, tram ride was ordinary, the guide on the tram was misleading when she said 'on your left', which was actually her left hand side as she was facing us. I am sure the park could offer us more."
,,Boring,3.0,,"On my trip to Singapore there were few disappointments Night Safari was one of them, one it was very far from my Hotel around 21 km, which is a big distance for a country like Singapore, they charge a good amount for the safari, there are lot of people and make it messy, just a one time watch thing, and if can avoid its better."
,,"Living Disneyland, in the bad sense...",2.0,,"Highly commercialized safari. You pay quite a lot, take a 40"" train and see various relatively of small variety of sleepy animals..... For me, definitely not a must, unlike I was told before...."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,The tram ride which goes along the path was interesting but not many animals to see. We visited many attractions whilst in Singapore & thoroughly enjoyed them all very much but this would have been the only one we were so disappointed with. No recommendation from us for a visit here
,,Rip off.......,1.0,,"Ok. For ppl who plan to visit this place. Be warned. It is extremely hyped. if you have 35$ with you, use it for something else. its bloody dark and they show you 5 - 6 varieties of buffaloes... 1 tiger and 3 lions. its like taking a stroll through the zoo at night.. A safari is supposed to have animals in the wild and with the sheer number of people who visit, no animal would want to show its face to you.. its a total rip off.. I preferred the zoo and Jurong Bird park. compared to those 2, this one is a piece of $#!£..

Also.. too crowded.. too many screaming people.. its not a SAFARI!!!!.. its a night zoo!!!

If you are ok with that. please go ahead and experience tamed indian animals in the ""wild"""
,,A bit hectic,4.0,,"We went to the Night Safari by taxi from our hotel, a tour was available but it lasted four hours and did not guarantee a return to the hotel. The first thing that struck us on arrival at the venue was the sheer volume of people, it was not at all as I had imagined - with lots of food stalls and stands with souvenirs. We watched a fire eating demonstration before queuing for some time to board a tram. The queue behind us wound round for a very doing way, but we eventually boarded a tram with commentary as it made it's way round the 40 minute tour. It was a interesting tour with the various areas lit up both sides of the path, and there was anticipation as to which animals we would see next. Fortunately they were mostly quite near the path, and we caught sight of nearly all of them. The commentary was a bit dreary, but informative. After we left the tram we had a quick round the shops there then left - apart from the actual tour it was all a bit hectic for me."
,,very good!,5.0,,"buy ticket from travel agency cheaper, and night safari is very good! i thought i cannot see animals because it is dark but there is enough light for me to see all the animals unless they hide away. the tram ride brings us to see many animals up close and animals even cross the road.

there is many species of pigs, deer and bull. wallaby trail is filled with many cute animals!

but try not to bring young children because they will shout and animals will hide."
,,Expensive but very well.done,4.0,,We spent the afternoon enjoying the zoo & then did the night safari. I felt we needed more help understanding how everything worked & where to queue but overall it is a well oiled machine & the staff keep the large crowds moving on & off trams so we could enjoy the zoo at night. The guide was very professional even though his patience was tested the the max by people who.continued to use flash photography despite his very explicit instructions to turn it off. My favourite where the orangutans. Absolutely loved them & overall a good experience...
,,Perfect,5.0,,"Perfect park with many beautiful and rare animals like hyenas, Indian wolves, Indian gharial and Sri Lankan leopard"
,,"Nice, but less than expecxted",3.0,,"The Night Safari Park is an interesting place to visit and I would recommend it for anyone interested in animals. The tram ride that goes along the path which offers an opportunity to view animals in their natural habitat at night is interesting but chances of actually seeing the animals is hit and miss. Some animals were out in the open areas and easily observed while other, more elusive animals, offered the fortunate few a quick glimpse at best. The other shows offered in the park were entertaining, especially the fire breathers."
,,Great alternative to traditional zoo experience,5.0,,"We had previously been to the Singapore Zoo and loved it, and on our latest trip we decided to try the night safari, and I'm glad we went. It gave such a different perspective and feel to a traditional zoo, as it was great to walk the trail at night to the enclosures, it hardly felt like we were at a zoo at all. My tip would be to get there a little bit after the 7:30pm opening time, as I believe a lot of people come across form the zoo and spend the evening here. We arrived just after 8pm and skipped the tram ride and went straight to the walking trail. Again I'd recommend this too, as we did the tram ride last and it was much less busy, and therefore quiet. Overall I really enjoyed this as it is a different was to experience the animals, but if you had to choose between the night safari and the zoo, I'd still consider the zoo a better attraction."
,,Animals in the night,4.0,,"It is a good idea to take the tram tour first to get an overview. Then, there are various trails to walk. But even with lots of signs, we managed to lost a few times. Very unique way to see animals."
,,The biggest crowd I have ever seen in a zoo,3.0,,"We had no other choice and had to visit on a Friday night so we are kind of guilty. Back to the facts.
The queue to the entrance was huge. Hundreds of visitors herded in front of us.
We managed to get through only to be met by another queue. More than a 1- hour long queue to trams.
We have chosen to traverse the path allowed on foot wondering at the same time what imperative drove these masses to wait an hour standing there.
Unfortunately the walking trails do not cover the same area as the trams ones and you are forbidden to walk on train road. A pity.
Nonetheless we saw plenty of species in the dark tough I think we expected much more. More of a safari I guess and less of a night.
After almost two hours on foot with our children of 4 and 6 years old we finally ended up on a taxi stand. We had to wait 45 minutes in the queue. Do not make the same mistake and call for a taxi. (When we managed to get a taxi the queue was two times longer than 45 minutes before).
One more thing. Do not by a combo ticket comprising the River Safari. Waste of money. The number of places on the boats is very limited and you cannot get one even if you show up in the morning regardless of the fact that you posses o 30-day long valid ticket."
,,must do,5.0,,"amazing walking, natural, very relaxing, good for all ages, kids, adults good services amazing walking, natural, very relaxing, good for all ages, kids, adults good services"
,,A must,5.0,,"A must to do in Singapore; go there around 19.30 when the night falls (taxi from the city center costs you 25 dollars), do the walking tours first (because people are queing for the tram), then after one hour walk, take the tram and make the tram tour. taxi back is a bit harder to get - need to stay in queue for 15 minutes"
,,Brilliant visit for a business trip,4.0,,"Quite bizarre to get into an open sided 'land train' and be taken aounnd a very dark zoo, with a number of compounds where the animals were generally being fed and seemed very aclimatised to the viewers. Interesting food court after the trip around with tasty adn good value food and drink."
,,Ok,3.0,,"If you have done safari in Bangkok, this safari comparatively is ok…the best part of night safari is the nocturnal animal show…don't miss it…or else if you are doing it for first time…you will enjoy the safari"
,,Over rated attraction.,1.0,,"Just to let unwary tourists know how this night safari goes cause you cannot find any information on it and you are really left in the dark...so to speak.
We did day zoo in afternoon and loved it so were really looking forward to seeing the same animals in the night time.
Wrong. It is a completely different section of the zoo. You line up about 150 meters away from the day zoo entry to a whole another set of shops and eateries. No one tells you that there is food at the entry to the night zoo when you are waiting outside the day zoo.
So you amble up to the night zoo, or arrive via taxi, bus or coach. You line up waiting for the entry time...note...it varies according to the time of year and the tour guides cannot tell you actually what time the entry will be. Between 6.30 and 7.30pm. I say don't rush..wait until all the first lot have gone on the trams.
They have a flame dancer show first which is just Malay dancers filling there mouths with flammable liquid and spitting it into flames. Terrible diesel stench and god knows what it is doing to these guys mouths, teeth and pharynx. You can avoid that if you want.
You then get herded into lines to wait for at least 1/2 hour to board packed three or four carriage trams. They take off eventually at dusk. Ohh! By the way..don't forget your mossie protection cause they offer you none and one can is $13. A dose of dengue fever or malaria not worth it!
The tram ride does have some good information if you can here it over the talking and kids crying.
However, go for the front carriages if you can cause they stop in the spots for the front but just drive on past for the back carriages. It really was boring as the animals seen are mostly deer or deer like animals, cattle, buffalo or and very briefly the lions. They don't even stop at the lions, which they heavily advertise as your opportunity to see the lions moving around...but you cannot walk back to them cause the walking section doesn't even include them, or any the animals you see on the tram ride...so don't think you can come back to see them later.
After the tram ride, you can take a walk. It takes about 1/2 hour and was the best bit really. Bats, porcupines, hyenas and lots of smaller animals and the best was the diving cats. Small leopard like cats that dive into the water to catch fish. This is well managed.
We did the whole thing in 1 hour once we got on the tram. It then took us an hour to get back via the $5 bus to the city which is an excellent service.
For those that are interested it was a Monday night we visited and there would have been 1000 people and kids and it was NOT busy!
SO SERIOUSLY OVERRATED!! Almost a con, I would say. Do the day zoo and the S.E.A. Aquarium and the bird park..they are all fantastic as is the botanic park."
,,Loved the night safari,5.0,,"Enjoyed this even more than the San Diego Safari. Prey and predictor animals in close proximity but separated by motes and other physical barriers. Staff says that this ""stress"" is good for breeding... Enough simulated moonlight to see the animals in their nocturnal environment. Flash cameras were strictly forbidden as they alarm the animals."
,,Wow how bad,3.0,,"Lined up for ages for tram... which was OK ... you get that.. take your pic here.. take your pic there.. OK good money revenue. .
Um mm can't see animals too dark.. slow down can't get focus on my camera ...
There's a deer. . Oh and another.. There is a rino back there she said... somewhere..
The show it self was good ...
But that's it :("
,,"Too dark, too fast",3.0,,Had heard glowing reviews but it failed to meet expectations for two adults. It was pretty impossible to take pictures due to low light and distance to the animals even for people with big cameras. We've seen more animals close up in our zoo in New York. The train taking us through went too quickly and 4 across seating mad viewing difficult.The final show was touristy but cute.
,,Night safari,5.0,,What a great idea but getting to see some of the animals etc. was a little hard. I liked being able to walk through the bush at night on a well defined path.
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"The Singapore Night Safari definitely is one of a kind. We really enjoyed it, however, the tour we went on didn't allow us enough time to watch the show, enjoy the tram ride AND walk along the designated treks. When we went, there was a 30minute wait for the Tram - so prepare for that.

One thing that really got on my nerves - tourists who couldn't understand ""please turn off your flash"". The host of the Night Safari show said the phrase in several different languages, and yet people still neglected to follow his instructions. I wish people would think about the animals they are viewing, instead of the photos they want to take. These animals are nocturnal - their eyes can't handle flash.

Overall, it was definitely an enjoyable night. I would suggest leaving your camera at home - unless you have a camera which can take great photos without the use of flash. You can always buy postcards."
,,Really worth the trip,4.0,,"A good chance to see animals up close and without glass in between you and the animals. Lions, tigers, rhinos, elephants are all only about max. 75 feet away. Some animals were right beside us grazing away.
On arrival you are herded into lines to the trams, which are electric and quiet, but then it makes eventual seating much faster. The trams wind through the dark and while in some spots it is tough to see the animals, especially if they are in the brush, the subdued lighting works overall.
With the constant daytime heat in Singapore the animals are somewhat more active, or at least awake, at night, and we enjoyed our first nighttime zoo visit.
Shops and restaurants are plentiful , if rather expensive, and overall it is a good setup.
I think you get more out of the walking trails if you have a guide with you instead of doing on your own."
,,Could Be Better,3.0,,"This has the potential but, unfortunately, the experience is marred because you can't hear the narrative. It is lovely to see the animals in their natural habitat at night but missing the explanation is frustrating. There are so many people on the tram it is impossible to keep them from talking with the narrator being so far away."
,,"Had a great time, well worth a visit!!",5.0,,"We like going to zoo`s so felt we had to try this one, having never been to one at night. It was nice to see animals at night as they act a lot different to during the day. The tram ride was good, and although it was pitch black, your still able to see quite a lot with the subtle moon light they have in place. Being hot and humid during the day going at night made it a lot more bearable to walk around. Even though we got here at just after opening time, it was quiet, and no lines for the tram, we did go on a mid-week night which probably helped!

We made the mistake and taking the MRT and then local bus to get there, took us 1:30 from central Singapore, sure it was cheap, but was way to much hassle, and if you had kids they would be very tired and fed up by the time you arrived. Just get a taxi too and from, cost SGD30 one way and takes about 30min depending on traffic!"
,,"not worth, just some animals barely see them in the dark",1.0,,"There was a nightshow with bunch of small animals , they gathered hundreds of people there at open air theather area including us and the show was nonsece"
,,"Nice zoo, but some animals seem unhappy which is depressing",4.0,,"We spent one night here and it was a mixed experience. While I am not a fan of keeping animals in captivity, I had heard that Singapore was revolutionary in the treatment of the animals. Some animals seemed quite content and even happy ( the snow leopards were playing all over their enclosure), but others like the lions and Golden Cat were pacing anxiously which was very sad.

The tram ride was neat as was the bat enclosure. We were eye to eye with flying foxes and they were very curious and just looking at us! The food here was also good, although expensive. The animals do seem very well cared for, even the three legged snow leopard, but some could use more entertainment/enrichment and larger enclosures.

(Be aware it is around $30 taxi fare each way from Chinatown)."
,,A different zoo experience,5.0,,"The Night Safari in Singapore is a unique chance to see animals, who are otherwise (mainly) nocturnal, in action. The safari consists of both a guided tram tour (of approx. 40 minutes with one stop along the way) and walking paths that you can take at your own speed. Our guide was very fun (you could tell she liked her job) and you get a chance to see the animals up close in a way I haven't experienced in other zoos. If you're looking for a different zoo experience than what you usually get, this is a good choice.

Don't expect to be able to take any photos unless you have a camera fit for night photos (flash isn't allowed, of course, and the lighting is very sparse). If you visit on Fridays, Saturdays or public holidays you can catch the feeding of some of the animals - but the crowds may take away some of the added experience. We were there on a Sunday and had great fun."
,,A must visit attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"Irrespective of what age the traveller is , from kids to adults, this place is a must visit in Singapore. These are several buses running to and fro to the destination, pls make sure you get hold of one of them thru the agency."
,,"Over-priced, over-hyped",2.0,,"We had heard about the Night Safari for years and were honestly expecting a lot. Perhaps our visit (during Chinese New Year) was poor timing...the place was mobbed and the animals were probably as happy to avoid the crowds as we wished we'd been.

We paid SD 52 apiece with a tour company downtown (which included coach from our hotel - happy for that - we had weighed taking public transport which would have been MRT and then a bus, coming from our hotel in Tiong Bahru) and I believe the walk-up ticket price was SD 39. Regardless, you are shuttled into the staging area (restaurants and gift shops with exorbitant prices adjacent) where you wait to be loaded onto a tram. The tram rolls slowly through the zoo (in the dark - but the animal enclosures are dimly lit) for forty-five minutes while the animals (more often than not) chomp down on the food that's been put out for them. Some animals are barely visible but most you can see. Good variety of animals to be seen but the whole situation is rather lethargic and doesn't do much to improve your understanding of these wild creatures..

A ""fire show"" (fire-eaters and dancers) at the entranceway to entertain before and after the tram ride. And of course the shops and snack bars. And you can get an over-priced Indian buffet to go with your ticket (don't do it).

I would say, if anything, go to the zoo during the day. Or just avoid altogether."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Very nice safari that I would recommend - especially for familys. Nice to see the animal at night as they are much more awake than at day time. Do not take the tram around the park, but take the walk - must more to see and you don't sit with 50 other people taken pictures at the same time :-)"
,,Didn't like it,2.0,,"We bought a 'Changi Recommends' deal from the airport, which included the Night Safari. The ticket counter is on the left towards the back so not easy to find. There is a sign saying which counter to use for those who have Changi Recommends deal, and for us it was counter 3, but none of the counters were numbered. Assuming it was the last one, as there were only three counters, we joined the long queue there, only to be told when we got in the front that it was the other counter on the other end! Back to the queue again! Next was the long long long queue to board the tram, and the queuing was not worth it. It is nothing spectacular, apart from the thrill that the animals are not in an enclosure. You need a camera that can focus in such darkness and take a shot. We were lucky that all the animals were there for us that night, apart from the wolf. All we wanted after this was to take some dinner and go to our hotel, but none of the food outlets cater for takeaways. The only place that does is Bongo Burger, I think it's called (keep this up guys!), so either eat before you come, or come early and choose a food outlet to eat and then go join the tram queue or just go to Bongo Burger for takeaway (burgers, chicken and chips, some pasta dishes). I wouldn't recommend anyone I know who is going to Singapore to go to the Night Safari unless they have absolutely nothing to do."
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"A unique way to see the animals, it was great, you can either walk around and or get the shuttle. You really see the animals is a new light (no pun). Good facilities, food drink etc,would be even better if some of the visitors didn't insist on using flash photography !!! Highly recommend. Easy to access via a cab from City Centre, should pay about 10 pounds."
,,Night Safari,5.0,,"Did the super night safari, really good fun and plenty of animals to see, over all a very good night out and well worth the visit. The only comment I would make, and this is not a fault of the zoo, we should have planned our visit due to the time it took to get to the zoo on public transport (From China Town) in rush hour. If you are planing a visit I would suggest you give yourself 1.5 hours traveling time."
,,something different,4.0,,"We were told this was a ""must see"". So we did the ""Dinner and Night Safari"". We must have gone on a ""quiet"" night, as the crowds were manageable and queue for the train not overly long. The tour bus arrives just as the place opens, and you head straight in for dinner. The dinner was the typical buffet style, and the people on our table all chose different dishes and all were complimentary of the taste and variety. Of the supplied drinks, I stuck to the water as the ""tea"" and coffee appeared to have been brewing for quite some time before we got there. There are options for viewing - take the train straight around without stopping and therefore only view what the guide and driver alter you to; take the train half way round and walk two of the trails; or walk all four trails to view the animals a little more up close and personal. There is also a short fire show and a longer night animals show with some trained smaller animals. Overall we enjoyed, although I can understand how difficult it might get when overcrowded."
,,"Overcrowded, animals not that visible at times",3.0,,"If you have been on safari in Africa, don't go. You will be disappointed. We were told that after being on safari, zoos are a real letdown and unfortunately that is what happened to us. The crowds and the smells were overpowering and we got bounced from ticket counter to ticket counter trying to use our Day Pass for 3 Activities that we had purchased.
The worst part of the whole night though was the bus trip using SAEX. We arrived at the bus stop at 6:02 pm and the bus finally arrived at 7:20 pm. It turns out the first bus was full after the first 3 hotel stops, but the company did not have the courtesy to let passengers further down the line know that there would be no bus coming. We had to go inside the hotel to get the concierge to call to see where the bus was. First of all the company stated that we were not at the stop at the appointed time of 6:15 pm and then finally admitted that the bus was full and had not bothered to check to see if there was waiting passengers. Very poor business practice."
,,Nice experience but too far from the center,4.0,,"We didn't know that it took a bus about 40mins to go from the nearest MRT to the Night Safari. So wnen we reached their, it was 11pm and we could only take the tram because tram only takes 45mins and the night safari closes at 12pm. The guide told us facts about the animal, very informative and it was very nice to see them at a close distance. However, it was stink at some places, it would be better if they can fix that. I'd love to come back to do the trekking!"
,,"Night Safari, Singapore",5.0,,"After reading several dismal reviews of this my expectations were quite low. I was pleasantly surprised by what a great time we had. There were a lot of people even for a Wed night, but we arrived before 7, watched a bit of the fire show then went straight in to get a seat on the first tram - definitely recommend getting to tram early, especially if you have kids. Tram ride was great, then walked all the trails over the next hour or so (rushed as had buses & trains to catch). Fantastic zoo, no cages as such, saw heaps. Some animals we didn't see, but most we did. Only negative was ignorant people being noisy, and using flashes & torches after explicit instructions not to. Overall great experience, much cooler for walking at night and would definitely recommend. Just maybe not on a weekend night when really busy."
,,Wonderful Night Safari,5.0,,"I'd not visited a zoo since the 1980s which ended up with reporting it to the authorities for poor care of animals! What made me go was a recommendation from a family member.....the animals are clearly well looked after and have spacious accommodation.....the night safari provided the opportunity to see animals not normally seen in zoos, especially by daytime visitors. It was seeing this within the overall philosophical approach of seeking to preserve species and care for animals in their own environment and as an educational tool that helped me put my reservations to one side and enjoy a fascinating experience"
,,Just go to the zoo during the day.,3.0,,"We decided to do the night safari as we had an inclusive pass. It was SO FREAKIN crowded that we ended up walking the entire zoo enclosure and viewing the animals that way. At the end of the night we took the train only to be with several groups of people who had no idea how to be respectful and quiet. They were eating, using flash to take pictures, and simply could not shut up. It was honestly not enjoyable. The zoo itself is fantastic and I recommend you just walk the enclosures at night instead of taking the tram. We got to help feed an asian otter, got close up with a slow loris having a munch, and watch loads of beautiful night time creatures in quiet."
,,fantastic,4.0,,We visited the night safari our first night in singapore. it was a great experince. most of the animals were awake and moving around as the temp was cooler then during the day. the tram takes you past most of the animals. we also then walked around the zoo. this can be daunting at times as you hear lots of noises and the light on the paths is the bare minimum for the sake of the animals but definately a great experience.
,,Really don't know what all the fuss was about,2.0,,"Our train left when it's almost dark, so I don't know if that's the reason we could barely see any animals because it was supposed to be a ""night"" safari. But by the end of our ride, it was totally dark, yet it didn't get any more exciting. Even the Night Creatures show wasn't that good. I was excited for it, thought it'd be better than the train ride but it was not. Enjoyable but nothing extraordinary. Too expensive for such experience."
,,Over rated,2.0,,"The crowd, the line for the tram, then again the line for the show, all this made the experience not enjoyable. We expected for the lighting to be better than that, since it is called Night Safari, but you could hardly see the animals. The animal show, where the animals do tricks was cute, if a bit cheesy. The food there was expensive, twice the price, if not more, of what you would pay on the street. In conclusion, I would not recommend it."
,,Interesting to see some of the night animals,4.0,,"We arrived around opening time but I think the best time to get here is about an hour before that. We went from line to get in to line to see the night creatures show. It looked like there was a long line for the tram for most of the night so we walked most of the area - but had to skip a few animals to get on one of the last trams. (We also needed to get the public bus back to our hotel!)
This was a great place to see the animals of the region but I would recommend getting there before opening and being in line!"
,,Avoid the Night Safari,2.0,,"Built up to be an amazing experience to see nocturnal animals.

Maybe they are nocturnal but in the dark, in dark enclosures they could have been people dressed as animals for all that we could see from a road train and even when we walked around and got a little closer.

We laughed as you have to laugh don't you. It was pathetic and hugely disappointing"
,,"""okay"" rating because our expectation was high...",3.0,,"Because the quality of S'pore zoo is really high, I expected the same level of experience to the Night Safari. That was wrong. I should rank her as ""very good"", but biased because of this high expectation before the visit.

Animal show is really entertaining. I recommend to sit the second/third-row, just next to the working path. You will know why.

But the tram ride is not so exciting… yes, because animals are just animals, they move only when they need to move, which means ""eating food"". Nocturnal/Diurnal doesn't matter actually…

And the fire show… it is out of the context. And more importantly, the show is done outside the zoo. So basically once you are in the zoo, you can not see it.

If you have a chance to go to the zoo, I definitely recommend the day zoo."
,,Bets you can get,5.0,,One of the most closed counters to the animals. A paradise for kids & a great end of the day. Best trip is to make the Zoo in the day & come here in the eve for Night safari.
,,Great when you actually get in!,3.0,,"This a great attraction, however the shear number of people made it feel like hell. We waited 1.5hrs to get on the tram that goes round the park. With travel and waiting time we wasted 3.5hrs for a 40 minute attraction. That said would I recommend, absolutely, its worth seeing."
,,Interesting but could be done better.,3.0,,"The experience was good, never been to a Zoo at night but the down fall of the night was the amount of people queuing to get onto the Tram, it was very hot and we had to queue for around 40 mins. Once on the Tram the ride went for 40 minutes. The animals you could hardly see due to poor lighting. After the Tram ride you had to then queue again for the Animal Show. We didn't get to experience that because the queue was too long so really for the four hour tour we took we got to experience one out of the four activities available to do. We did see the Fire show at the very end on the tour, but we had experienced that in Fiji. I would recommend taking lots of water and comfortable shoes for the amount of time you spend lining up."
,,the animals,4.0,,"I have not had time to see the show before starting the night safari. as the animals are not free, they seem cared for and respected. remains fascinating the option to walk alone in these spaces and to admire the animals. animals that I have not seen even in the rainforest in the following days in malaysia"
,,Unique and Informative But...,3.0,,"We went to the Night Safari instead of the Singapore Zoo because our itinerary allowed for only a few daytime activities and we arrived in Singapore at night. This was the very first attraction we saw during our trip and, though it wasn't really an absolute disappointment, I wish the experience could have been better.

Indeed, the Night Safari offers a completely different experience from most regular zoos. It's also open until 11:00 PM, so it's possible to squeeze this activity in even if your itinerary for the day is already full. We also loved how professional and friendly their staff were, and there weren't a lot of people when we visited the place, so everything was smooth and easy.

However, when we took the tram ride, many of the animals were asleep. I do not know if this was because we took the last trip or this was by chance only, but we were not able to see many animals because they weren't around. The Malayan tiger, for instance, was nowhere to be found and there were a few other animals we weren't able to see. It was a bit awkward at times because there were moments when the tram would stop for a while and the guide would emphasize certain areas where animals can be seen, but we'd end up searching and staring at the grass and trees without seeing anything. Save for the informative and well-delivered commentary by the guide, I would have been really upset. Fortunately, we saw some lions, hyenas, and a couple of Malayan tapirs, so that pretty much made up for the other missing animals, but the missing tiger was really a big letdown.

The place was also dim, so my camera was absolutely useless here. I struggled taking photos of the animals so much so that in the middle of the ride, I gave up and just kept it in the bag. It was a hundred times better to just listen to the commentary and watch the animals around than to take photos here. It's less frustrating and more relaxing. If you're intending to take night shots of animals, I suggest bringing really fast and good lenses. Do remember, as well, that flash photography is strictly prohibited here, so lighting is definitely going to be a problem when taking photos.

Finally, this activity was expensive. It's possible to purchase cheaper tickets through online promotions, but even so, I find the price to be a bit too much. I understand that the money is used to fund the maintenance of the park and the care of the animals, but I felt like I could have instead visited a regular zoo and enjoyed the experience with the same amount I've paid for the Night Safari.

In the end, though I find this to be educational and unique, I don't see myself going back. Next time, I would probably consider going to the Singapore Zoo instead."
,,Zoo By Night,5.0,,"Having already visited the Singapore Zoo by day the Night Safari is definitely quite a different way to view the animals as well as the two shows put on in other areas. The first one was a demonstration of fire eating and the other was the 30 minute show put on in the outside auditorium showcasing some of their animals who mostly come out at night - a very good performance by all. You need quite a few hours here to see and do everything, including any souvenirs you may wish to pick up. We went up by the MRT but came back by taxi as it was quite late when we left but the $25 fare was well worth it to get back to our hotel near Clarke Quay very quickly."
,,The best night trail out!,5.0,,"Night Safari was a combo of entertainment and education! The Creatures of the Night show was outstanding and very funny in parts as the crowd were set up by the staff. The Wallaby Trail - the visit through the safari on small open carriages - was very informative and showed a good range of animals, Only downer was that many of the animals were subdued or hard to see!! Well - remember it was night! Very good!!"
,,Interesting zoo experience,4.0,,"We visited the zoo and did the Night Safari all in one day which I would NOT recommend. We started late in the day to visit the regular zoo so we wouldn't have long to wait for the evening safari. This did not allow us enough time to see the entire zoo. In addition, they had started moving some of the animals from the zoo area into the Night Safari section. We did not expect the Night Safari to be a separate section in the zoo. Unfortunately, we did not realize there was entertainment and shops in the Night Safari section so we waited outside the main zoo interest which was not nearly as interesting. The tram tour was good, the lines were a little long, appearing we were waiting for the darkness to fully set in. There were several walking trails within the Night Safari section that we were unaware of prior to our visit. Unfortunately, having spent time at the zoo earlier in the day, we were too tired to do the walking trails. This is a very interesting twist to experience the zoo. I would recommend doing the Night Safari all by itself so you can fully enjoy the experience."
,,Neat experience,4.0,,"My friend suggested we take our boys to night safari. Once there the line ups were not what we are used to in Australia.
The safari was great but animals looked a bit sleepy and too relaxed. Some of the animals are not nocturnal but they are in areas with very low lighting.
Food at food court was fantastic for a theme park. This Zoo is not privately owned but owned by the government.
I do highly recommend the Safari."
,,A great night,5.0,,We arrived in time to have dinner before the park opened. The food is reasonably prices and huge serves. There are several places to eat within the park as well. The train ride was really educational and we got to see many animals quite closely. We then walked some trails to see more animals. This is an excellent zoo for a night time experience and worth the visit.
,,Mostly a very Disappointing experience,1.0,,"Everyone said it is a 'Must Do' in Singapore. In my opinion, you should only do, if you have nothing I to do. I will start on a positive. The Only enjoyable part was the Creatures Show. Although short, it was OK. Perhaps it was better than it actually was, because the rest was so poor. We were a group of 7 and arrived at approx. 8pm, we had pre-purchased tickets and walked straight in and we went to the tram ride to start our evening. The line was not long, the staff were friendly and we were on board in less than 10 minutes. We were asked many times to not use 'Flash' photography, unfortunately, this message was NOT received by Asian customers. This is not a racist comment, simply a matter of fact. Some people made excuses and said it was ignorance. Sorry, it is said in the popular Asian languages, as well on being written in brochures and on signs. I think it is more arrogance than ignorance. This includes making unnecessary noises and sounds to the animals when everyone has been asked to be quite while on the tram or walking. This spoiled the tram ride and was clearly frustrating for the staff.
However, the biggest problem with the Safari, is the poor visibility of the animals. Besides the animals 1 meter from the tram, the rest were difficult to see. They tell us these are nocturnal animals and there eyes are sensitive. I fully understand this and certainly want the animals protected and cared for correctly. I am not a animal or light expert, however, if normal 'white' light cannot be turned up so we can see the animals, they either need to find another type of light which is safe for the animals and provides a higher and satisfactory view for the customer or simply go to the day Zoo.
Between the rude customers and the hard to see animals, it was a very disappointing experience. I want my money back."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"We had been really looking forward to visitng the night safari, and despite getting there before the gates opened, the queues were horrendous. There was way too many people there to really enjoy the night- you got herded like cattledown to watch the creatures of the night show, but then had to sit and wait half an hour for it to start. Then there was an absolutely enormous line to go on the tram tour. After that, we'd had enough, so we then headed out, where there were huge queues for the buses and taxis. It was just lucky that we were approached by a minibus driver and managed to avoid those other lines.The whole outing had the potential to be enjoyable, but the ridiculous overcrowding meant it just was a let down."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"I liked the Night Safari---riding the tram through the jungle at night and seeing animals in low light under relatively natural conditions. The sighting of the Malaysian tiger was unforgettable.

It is expensive, but on the other hand, it takes money to care for the animals, to run breeding programs. So. . . no complaints. But it's not a cheap event.

I found that there were some more upscale dining options outside NS. More pub-like places with drinks, etc. Nicer than the food court outside the Zoo, itself. If I were going to return, I'd have dinner here and be early in the line for the tram.

Some of shows were a little forced ---manufactured humor. But they were ok. I did not do the individual walks.

Have to say I think the interface between the Zoo and the city is confusing. Lot of options but none quite right for me. I ended up taking a taxi from my hotel to get there. Then coming back, I took a bus to the MRT and the MRT to my hotel. There was a taxi queue somewhere but I couldn't find it."
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"Totally worth it. If you can choose, go on Friday or Saturday so you can see both shows, first the Thumbuakar Show at 6.45 pm, just before opening hour at 7.00 pm, than watch the Creatures of the night show at 7.30 pm, afterwards board the tram to see one part of the safari, and in the end you have plenty of time to walk and see the animals, some you've seen already with the tram, and others you have not. We headed back to the city with the bus around 22.30 pm, and had enough time to go to the apartment with MRT."
,,Nice to see animals in open at night,5.0,,It was a nice experience with heavy rain and open zoo at night. Some time felt scaring when you get very close to a tiger or lion in open. Overall fantastic to feel nature around you.
,,Everything about this is good,5.0,,"Such an enjoyable night from the food to the shows to the tram ride. The first eatery by the entrance didn't look like very good food (chips, burgers, hotdogs) but we sat at a table there and had a really good view of the fire show which was quite impressive. We actually ate at the buffet which was excellent and I don't usually like buffets. Instead of excessive options there were several Asian dishes cooked really well.

The Creatures of the Night show was definately worth going to. It was well presented and entertaining. The tram host had some interesting facts as well.

Some people complain that all the animals were sleeping and not doing much but really what do they expect; circus tricks? We were pleased to see some animals quite close to the tram and felt really lucky to see/hear wolves howling at the moon.

We went as a couple in our 20s and really enjoyed it. I don't feel that it would be a great place to take small children though as visitors are expected to not make much noise and it can be a long night. The tram ride alone is approx 40min and the walking trails are quite extensive. Would absolutely recommend to adults though."
,,Great experience for the whole family,4.0,,"We took our two young kids to the Night Safari (mum and dad having been before). They thoroughly enjoyed the tram ride and the accompanying commentary was entertaining (altho don't plan on taking great night photo's, as the tram rarely stops moving, even though it is quite slow). The highlight for me was seeing the tiger.

There are a few walking trails to do altho we didn't attempt them with the kids - it does offer some variety from other things you will do in Singapore. Other things to do include the main show - about 20-30 mins, and entertaining, as well as the fire eating show (also entertaining).

All in all, it was a good trip out - it's a good half hour from the city centre. One thing to beware of is that it can get quite crowded, and you may get a few bug bites too. It's possible to strategically plan your show times and tram rides to reduce wait times."
,,Yet another new experience,4.0,,"After zoo, we went for the night Safari. The shows are good and Tram ride was splendid. I'm just glad that my 3 year old didn't get scared and force me to leave prematurely....:)"
,,Such high expectations but left disappointed,2.0,,"Unfortunately my partner and I were disappointed with our visit to the Night Safari. We got the bus there, which was easy and we were in time to watch the Creatures of the Night show, which was nearly cancelled because of rain, but went ahead. The show was quite good, and featured many animals; we just thought they were trying to be too entertaining and not very informative.

The walks/trails were a little confusing, and some of the animals were asleep! The information boards didn't contain much information at all, and you couldn't see some of the animals in amongst their cage/habitat.

After walking all the trails, we went on the tram ride, which only took us to view a few more animals than we saw on our own on the trails! We thought the elephant looked frustrated, as it was swaying from one foot to the next constantly, and swinging it's trunk... not normal elephant behaviour in our opinion. The tram commentary was quite loud, considering you are told to be quiet.

Although it was nice to see animals at night, we were not very impressed with the Night Safari and think it is a bit overrated and expensive."
,,A nice! Experience,5.0,,"My son had a great time! It was one of its kind experience, animals are not put in regular zoo cages & trams help u have a nice ride among the animals !"
,,Dont go there,2.0,,"It is a money mashine, and the annimals do not realy have it as they should. We booked this at our hotel. Where picked up at time, but was not told, that the attractions at the venue, only was possible when there nor´t was many visitors - there was many, and the que to the tram through the park was taking 1 hour, and then we where told to be quiet not to disturbe the annimals. Then the guide spoke so loud, that we had to take earplug in, and still we could hear her. Loosing that time with going there and waiting on a bus park for a bus change, it was not possible to do more then 1 attraction, but we paid for a whole park adventure. All informations where first given upon arrivel to the park, and the guide was not realy organised. All things in the park are over rated and exspensive, as we saw some suvenirs there that should cost 149 SGD and we saw the downtown at 39 SGD. We can not recomand that place as we also not can recomand the SH tours who are selling this at the hotel. They are not telling the truth about there tours!! Also by complaining to them, they dont give you the money back, and do not respond directly to you. Only trhough there sales staff."
,,"High expectations, but......",3.0,,"High expectations, but…..
Having fantastic memories from previous stays in Singapore of the Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park, I anticipated a simply wonderful parallel experience at Night Safari. Whatever others may think, I know what I would do on a future visit and it’s not what I did this time.
I booked a tour from the hotel, pickup and drop off - a big mistake. I needed considerably more time at the site. Once there, I’ve learned shuttle buses, for a small fee, are available, giving much more flexibility at the attraction. Check these options online. Food outlets, stores open 5.30pm and the Night Safari 7.30pm until midnight. This attraction has a captive audience. Cursory viewing of food/snacks available, did not appear to represent much value for money and the souvenirs, many are sold at dozens of Singapore outlets.
Promotional material spoke of tram rides to see the animals, and shows. My reality was queue for 40 minutes, one tram ride by which time all shows were full or over. In the brief time before boarding return transport, so you don’t think my comments are totally distorted, I asked two strangers on my bus for opinions, and scores out of 10 (the highest): both scored 4 while I gave 3. I can, however, see the attraction’s potential, if one had time – much more time. Plan your journey, take a torch for individual walks and maybe eat before you go.
Night Safari attracts hundreds of people, as oc present during my visit. To contend with crowds and really enjoy the attraction, adequate time is essential."
,,Night safari worth a trip,5.0,,"We were taken as guests to visit the Zoo at night for the formal performance and night safari. I must admit I was tired and jetlagged, but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and found viewing animals at night when they are naturally more active a novel and excellent experience. The safari involves quiet electric trolleys driving a group around the zoo for 40 minutes with a running commentary. The animals did not seem bothered at all by the tourist trains, and we were warned to take flash photography which might have sacred them. It was worth the 30 minute drive from central Singapore and the late hour we got to bed!"
,,Try the night safari,5.0,,"This zoo is small, but wonderful. My favorite part was the bat cave... but if you are afraid of flying animals (I have a friend that is petrified) STAY OUT. They will be flying close and will probably touch you. The night safari is a wonderful idea as well, and they offer drinks! Fun!"
,,A nice! Experience,4.0,,"I had never been this close to wild animals until I visited Night Safari in Singapore. It was one of its kind experience and we got to see some very mesmerizing views once we boarded the tram which took us through the lives of these spectacular creatures. The guide on the tram was informative... describing the animals as we spotted them from the tram. They appeared to be so close to the tram... looked like the animals there were trained well not to react... even when they were not put in regular zoo cages. The show at the end of the safari was a good one where we got to see some performances by the trained animals. You are allowed to take pictures, but usage of camera flash is not allowed as it may irritate or startle some of the creatures there. Overall, a nice, one of its kind experience."
,,"Must visit, if you have been in Zoo",4.0,,"Located right next to Zoo, so make sure you go here too, if you have been in zoo. Little hard to get, because there is no MRT station, so bus and taxis are only options. They open their door 7pm and while you are in (long) queue, they have little ""fire breathing"" show. There are lots of people everynight, especially weekends and public holidays, so best days to go are weekdays(in low season). Route is almost pitch dark sometimes, but still it isn't too scary for children. Remember that you can't use flash, if you want to take pics"
,,A Different and Unique Experience,5.0,,"We bought a 3-in-1 (Bird Park, Zoo and Night Safari) pass including Tram from Expedia. This attraction was our last stop for the day after covering Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo. We were obviously very tired after walking 8-10 km in the hot and humid weather but we managed to reach Bongo Burgers at least half an hour before the Fire dance program. It was very difficult to find a place near the stage. We purchased some food from the Bong Burger. It was good (Though not great) and quite expensive.
The Fire dance by the indegeneous people is a must see. at the time the dance started, there were already more than 100 people waiting in front of the gate. So, make sure you reach the place (whether or not have food from Bongo Burgers) a bit early.
We started after all the people waiting are went into. Most of the people went for the Tram. We went for the ""Creatures of the Night"" show instead and it was a good choice. We managed good seats at the front. The show was simply wonderful. The presentation of the lady host, the show of the animals (especially the otters) was highly appreciated by everyone.
After the show, we boarded the tram. It was another amazing experience as we went through the park. It seemed we were really going though a jungle. The Tapirs and antilopes came pretty close. All the other animals (including the Lion and Rhino) were seems to within a stone throw distance.
After finishing with the Tram, we started walking through the trails. Few animals were asleep (like Leopards), but even then the trails seems to be a different world. We retired after covering two trails and boarded the tram again to reach the Gate.
It was already 11 p.m. So, we searched for food. There were many restaurants in the Safari. But surprisingly, no one had takeaway arrangement. After covering 3 attractions in a day and walking nearly 12-13 km we were not in a state to dine-in. So, we took something from Bong Burgers (choice was very limited at night). At the taxi stand, there was a long queue (even for premier taxis). However, we were able to get a mercedes taxi within 10 minutes.
Overall, I will rate this as a must see in Singapore and it is one of the best attraction I have ever visited."
,,Great night out,5.0,,"We turned up around 8:30/9pm after having had dinner in town, so we didn't eat at the park just hopped straight into the queue for the tram. We used our Singapore airlines boarding pass for a 15% discount on entry (not valid for combo pass tho).

The line for the tram was quite long, but very well managed and moved quite quickly. Very impressed with the way they have the next tram full of passengers lined up ready to hop on as the previous one pulls out.

The tram tour guide was very informative and the kids had a wonderful time spotting the animals. We saw lions, tigers and bears (oh my!) As well as flamingoes, deer, elephants, otters, giraffes and many others. The only thing my daughter was disappointed about was that she didn't see any monkeys!

After the tram ride we watched the Creatures of the Night show, which was fantastic. The kids found it hilarious when the snake was wrapped around the audience volunteer. I was also very impressed by the positive reinforcement of the reduce, reuse, recycling message - not to mention how cute it was to watch otters sort recyclable items into their appropriate bins!

As the kids were tired and it was late we did not do any of the independent walking trails, but I would definitely go back and do them next time!"
,,Not wowed,3.0,,"After reading up on this attraction, we had high expectations which were dashed by long queues (even on a Tuesday night in January) and strongly accented English of the guide who was on our tram. Granted, we were dog tired after having spent the entire day walking around the zoo so our perception may be coloured by that but if you've spent time in the zoo, the night safari tram ride adds little to the experience.

As we were tired, we thought we will take the tram ride and walk only in the areas that caught our interest. Due to the poor narration of the guide and having seen almost the same animals in the zoo earlier, we were not interested in walking through.

The creatures of the night show was well presented and was a good one to catch as the presenters were knowledgeable and professional and the animals (even the most unlikely of them) well trained."
,,Over-rated!,3.0,,"As an overall experience, we were disappointed by this attraction. We were picked up from our hotel at 6pm and dropped back there at 10.50pm. All this time spent to experience a quite interesting 40 minutes guided tram ride viewing nocturnal animals. Apart from the bus ride to and from the zoo, the activity of longest duration was being herded like cattle for over 45 minutes from the entrance to the tram; this was quite tedious and would have proved tiring for the elderly. Perhaps we just chose the wrong day for this attraction which had been highly recommended."
,,Terrific Night Safari,5.0,,"To be quite honest am personally not a zoo fan, however I must give exception to the Singapore Zool. The NIght Safari is a great experience. The animals are beautifully presented and the opportunity to travel round and also go on the trails is a unique experience, wonderful"
,,Always good,4.0,,"We always visit here - love it and its a lovely night out. Kids really enjoy it, my son loves the fireshow at the entrance."
,,Wonderful Evening Experience,5.0,,"Set in 40 hectares of tropical jungle, this attraction is designed to showcase nocturnal creatures and help youngsters (and the not so young) understand how Earth should be managed.I suggest you start with fire-eating (Thumbuakar) performance in the entrance plaza (no ecology here!) at 6.45p.m. Then go straight to the amphitheatre for the 7.30 performance of The Creatures of the Night . This wonderful show uses animals to demonstrate how we can help save the planet, this has to be seen to be believed! Their powers of eyesight (owls) and smell (monkeys) are also investigated. Go from there to the Tram Ride where you will see forest dwellers in their recreated natural habitats. If time permits there are four easy walking trails to delight you."
,,A Totally Different Perspective,4.0,,"Visit the Zoo at night! Wow what a different experience. Take the Tram ride first to see things that you won't be able to walk to. Amazing to be driven around in darkness, and to see animals, some right next to the tram, such as deer, tapir, even cattle at one stage. See the Lion pacing back and forth, the Tiger just sitting quietly under the trees of his enclosure. Then go back and do the trails on foot. A little eerie to be walking around in almost total darkness, feeling like you are the only one there. There are several trails you can walk and see night animals do their night thing. Take your time, we spent approx 3 hours or so wandering around. The food is a little overpriced and 'you' are a captive audience. Go and see the Night Creatures show. I totally enjoyed the whole experience."
,,Night Safari was OK,4.0,,"We only went for the night time Safari on this occasion and to be honest, It's not the best zoo experience I've ever had. A lot of the animals were asleep or hidden in dark places and hard to see. I think if we were to go again we would make a day of it, and see both the daytime and nocturnal animals.

If you're on a budget, I would eat before you go. The food was very tasty and heaps of options, though not the cheapest!"
,,Unique way to experience a zoo,4.0,,"We were very glad that we tried the Night Safari as it offers a unique way to view the animals in a nocturnal setting. The fire breathing entertainers put on a spectacular show as well. A couple of the attached pictures are a bit blurry but that is because I was using my camera's setting for shots in the dark, without a flash."
,,Better experience compared to the first,4.0,,"The place is still very dark, still very crowded especially at weekends, and tickets I feel overpriced.
Overall, I get to see more animals this time, take better pictures.
I don't prefer to take the tram first, like what most people that enters the place at 7pm do. Go start to the fishing cat trail instead, the trail is quiet at 7pm. quickly move on to cover all the 4 trails within 3 hours and take all the photos. At around 10pm the tram station is quiet, then I went for the tram ride, there are many empty seats at that time, I could move around on the seat to capture even more photos. I could afford to go 2 rounds and leave the place at 11.30pm.
There are no prefect timings to go on the trails or go for the tram ride, since Night Safari did not publish animal feeding times. At times the animals are sleeping and hiding, the next moment they are very active. If you want to see all animals, I suggest you book the classic explorer tour weeks before your visit, you can travel on a small buggy, and the buggy will stop at every exhibit at your request, but the ticket price is 3.5 times more, and minimum 2 tickets must be purchased."
,,"Worth the experience, but plan",4.0,,"The night safari is a great experience and our children saw it as a highlight of the Singapore trip. However, getting to and from the venue takes a bit of time and planning and don't leave too late otherwise the last buses back to the city are gone (which seems to be by about 1030pm) and only expensive taxi rides back are available. The last bus seems to be full too so don't leave departure to the last minute (as we did). Food options are pretty average if planning on eating there."
,,Worth the Price?? Not sure.,3.0,,"Anytime I go to a zoo, I always want to see the lions and tigers. Then, we get there and they are sleeping or lounging in the sun. This is always a let down. The night safari allows you to see the animals that are almost always inactive during a regular zoo in action.

When we first entered the night safari area we were told it was going to be very busy that night and that we probably would not be able to see everything as the lines for trams and the shows would be long. This was an immediate let down. Since the gates did not open until 7 PM and as we were quite early and it was not very busy yet, we sat and had a quick bite to eat at a very overpriced restaurant outside the safari gates. All the food establishments were very overpriced in my opinion, even for Singapore. The restaurant area quickly filled up and people were wandering around repeatedly looking for a table.

At 6:30 we decided to leave our table and head to the gates. The line was already massive and people were getting annoyed. It really was an unfortunate start to our time at the facility. There was a show outside the gates at 6:45 where men spit fire in the air. The show was very repetitive and at the conclusion there was a noxious gas smell in the entire area where the show took place. When we entered the gates we went immediately to the tram because that is what we really wanted to do with the kids. We got in the line relatively quickly, but, oh, they forgot to mention that the first tram did not leave until 7:20. This meant we would wait 20 minutes + 5 minutes per tram and we were at least 4 -5 trams away from getting on one. Well, when we finally got on a tram at 7:45, it was time to enjoy the safari.

The tram ride was relaxing and it was nice to see animals active. I was surprised that they emphasized so many typical zoo animals such as rhinos, hippos, zebras and giraffes. It was a let down as these are not animals I would consider to be nocturnal and the draw to the night safari is to see nocturnal animals. The lions and hyenas were the highlight...we did not see the tiger.

Once the tram finished, we walked along all the paths to the other animals you could not see on the tram ride. Nothing really exciting, although there is something novel about walking around a zoo at night. Since it was so busy though that novelty wore out quickly as people were pushing and shoving to see animals.

We did not get to see any shows because of the timing. With younger kids, we had to leave the safari around 10 PM. We were with a tour, but, if you go with a cab and expect to get back with a cab, expect a long wait as the line for the cabs was very long I noticed.

In the end, it was a unique experience, but, I am not sure it is worth the price of the ticket. Next time I would just visit the regular zoo instead."
,,Get there early,4.0,,"A great night out for the family, however if you want to go on the tram get their early. When we turned up it was over an hour wait for the tram so we decided to walk. It turns out you get to see more on the walking tour and can stop and wait for feeding. We saw the lions get fed."
,,Good night out!,4.0,,We spent the afternoon in the main zoo and then walked across to the night safari once the other zoo closed. Make sure you arrive early to the night safari as the line to get in is VERY long. We waited in line for almost an hour but were lucky enough to get on one of the first trains to depart. The actual safari is brilliant with many animals on display and so close to the vehicle. The tour guide was also very informative. A good night out but be prepared to wait if you don't arrive early.
,,So boring,3.0,,"It was so boring. This ranked highly on the list of things to do when in Singapore but would suggest you avoid .... go to the zoo instead The one saving grace was that we very easily organised this ourselves. We collected the entrance tickets from our hotel concierge and took a taxi there and back. Not only did this save us a significant amount of money, it also meant we could make a quick exit when we realised this was not the tour for us. On arrival we immediately made our way to the line up for the tram and despite quite a long queue we were on our way within about 10 minutes. Then we fell asleep. The attraction brochures exclaim that the animals can be seen ""frolicking"" All we saw were animals eating .... like they'd been kept indoors all day and just let out at night for their supper. Poor lighting - no sign of the hippos - and all in all just glad to get out of there. Luckily we could because we just hopped into one of them many many taxis waiting to take people home. Go to the zoo. So much better"
,,Great visit,5.0,,"Got the SAEX bus for $5 each outside hotel. Unlike the Zoo and River Safari which were not crowded when we visited, there were a lot of people at the Night Safari. However, the queue for the tram kept constantly moving and it did not seem long to wait. Lovely experience to see the animals at night. Also did the other walk but part of it was closed so did not actually see any wallabies."
,,Yuk!,1.0,,"We waited in a long line for a very slow and boring ride through various habitats that supposedly had lots of animals in them, but we did not see very many other than goats and some lions. And the narrator's sing-song voice was irritating and had no content of interest. We were on a tour that touted this as a must-see, but we'd had we known we'd have stayed in the hotel and read a good book. What a waste of an evening!
We also had dinner at a buffet restaurant there and it, too, had limited quality."
,,Something different from viewing it during the day,4.0,,"We caught SAEx bus from directly outside our hotel ( Orchard Hotel) for $5/ adult and $2.50 child which took as to the NS. They offered tickets for $2 less/ person on route there.
The kids enjoyed the night show and especially exploring the zoo at night.
Do the trails first as there is a HUGE line up to do the tram ride first.
The tram ride was a great way to finish up the night ( kids whining from all the walking by then).
It still depresses me to see animals enclosed and pacing back and forth presumably from boredom which does not just occur in this Zoo.
However, overall was an enjoyable experience and something a bit different than going during the day if your kids sleep late.
Make sure that you have organised your transport back to your hotel as there are NO TAXIS waiting after you have finished."
,,Totally worth the wait!,5.0,,"On Dec 28, we waited for 30 minutes to get into the Night Safari. Then another 1 hour for the tram ride. Though it was very hot and crowded, it was great to see the animals at night. I would totally recommend the visit. We were smart to book a taxi van for the 5 of us ahead of time, otherwise we had to stand in long line for taxi at 11 p.m. at night. It was a long taxi ride (about 30 minutes) to get back to our downtown hotel."
,,Night Safari A Treat,5.0,,This is a different way to experience a zoo. After the daylight and it cools a bit the animals get active. You have the opportunity to ride a tram around the park and observe the animals. Then you can use the walking paths and continue to observe them. It's a fun time especially for families.
,,Great educational tour and fun for kids and adults alike - requires night goggles !!,4.0,,"Fascinating tour of creatures of all sorts - there is a queue to get on the narrative tour (45 minutes) that takes place on a mini-train that is open on all sides; that said the queue moves quickly and the opened sides allows one to get a proper view of the animals as you pass them by (some may require you to squint harder than others). the animals are more active in the evening likely because it's less hot, so you have the perfect opportunity to see them roaming around.
There are about 4 walking trails that one could take instead of or after the train ride around the safari; this was awesome as you'd have the chanc to see some of the herds in closer proximity - I would allocate 2 hours just for the walking trails alone to take your time but be warned that the premises closes at midnight. While the night sounds may be eerie for some, it's perfectly safe with overhead lights and staff posted at strategic locations. Great value and fun overall !!"
,,Avoid public holidays,4.0,,"My partner and I went on 30th December, which was possibly the worst day in the year to visit the Zoo and Night Safari since all the locals kids commence the school term in the beginning of January, and of course, New Year's Eve is strictly reserved for adults to party, so it would be the only logical day for a final spot of fun before school starts.

Well, the queue was horrendous, even though we came armed with pre-purchased tickets. Good luck to those who aren't, because we noticed that the Night Safari tickets have to be purchased at the ticket counters outside the Zoo. We noticed a lot of confused visitors.

So, the queue to get in was about an hour, and the queue for the tram was close to another hour, which meant we only had time for one round on the tram, and missed the show, which apparently is the highlight of the place. We were not the only ones who missed it, about three-quarters of the others did too.

The tram ride was a little spooky, even for adults. It was incredibly dark for the sake of the animals, and flash photography is understandably forbidden. We gave up trying to take any meaningful photos, and actually quite enjoyed sitting back and simply watching instead of trying to capture images of the moment.

It was truly a shame that the experience we had turned out this way, but we have no doubt it would have been a much more enjoyable experience if we'd visited another time."
,,Not organised,2.0,,"This was the third time our family had been to the Night Safari, the first time for other family members travelling with us.

It was manic. You could not even get through the turnstiles as the crowd to hop on the trams was snake lined all the way back to the turnstiles. Staff seemed to have little idea on moving the crowd. We weren't even there that early arriving after 6.30pm.

For a generally well oiled country this experience left a bad taste in our mouth."
,,Long line ups,3.0,,"we arrived 20 minutes before gate opened and had to wait an hour for the first bus tour to leave it was annoying having to wait but you can walk first around the park and come back to the tour if you like but it was busy the entire night. I went on a Saturday what do you expect so choose a weeknight.

I would choose a day zoo not the night safari you cant take pics with a flash so bring a proper lens."
,,"Too dark, might induce nightmares",3.0,,"First-timers to the night safari would yelp in glee as it might seem like a novelty.

The last time I've visited was 19 years ago. I hardly remember much but that it was mostly dark. Now, 19 years later I thought I'd give it another go. Arm with my camera, I was abit disappointed that my 19-year-old memory was right. It was so dark I could hardly get a decent picture!

Best part of the visit was the Creatures of the Night show which was pretty entertaining. Think small furry racoons scurrying around the stage, otters trained to recycle and many more. For a park veteran like myself, I found the show quite hilarious too.

Another 'best' for me is the tram ride. Overall, I sat on the tram 2 times; one tram journey circling the park lasted for 30 mins. I reckon its the best way to start and end the night safari as the tram brings you to view certain animals that you can't otherwise see as there are no walking trails.

To enjoy the place fully, come prepared with night vision goggles, torchlight and mosquito patch.

Something to share - I asked the park guides whether Night Safari would turn off all the lights after the park closes at 12 midnight and I was amused that the answer was 'yes'. I guess the animals also know that when there are lights/spotlights, therefore it means showtimes. Lights out means its sleeping time. How cute is that!

Tip: Bring night vision goggles, might help prevent any unnecessary falls, cuts or bruises. It also gives a unique perspective when viewing the animals."
,,AWESOME - but confusing ticket sales strategy,5.0,,"Awesome zoo experience and a REALLY FUNNY wildlife show!! Great stuff.
We arrived at 7 to see a (lame) fire show and then the really funny animal show. After that we decided to first walk as much as we could and then take the tram which turned out to be a good choice.

The ticket sales strategy is confusing. Our walking tour guide sold us the tickets at 32 $. The express bus driver charged 35$ and at the counter we could buy it for 37$. Even though we lucked out other people got charged all different."
,,"Great night out, if you plan thoughtfully",4.0,,"Its taken us two years to make it out to the Night Safari and we were suitably impressed. We stayed for about 3.5 hours and out 9 and 11 year old were kept amused, nobody wanted to leave early and there was enough to see and do that we all felt the evening was worth it. Here are some tips below to make the most of your visit:

The primary mode of transport around the Night Safari are the trams. When the attraction opens there is a mad dash for the trams. You won't have to queue more than 10-15 minutes for a tram, but there are better ways to avoid the queues. Head for the first show at the amphitheatre. It starts at 7:30pm, but there is a short pre-show-show. Kids will enjoy it and your not rushing for a tram.

After the amphitheatre show, make your out of the turnstile (you get a hand stamp) and go watch the fire-show. It's a bit camp, but fun.

Now head to the trams. The trams on the far-side of the road seem to load up quicker and there are less queues. The staff do a good job of making the queues move.

Ride the tram to the East Lodge, get off of the tram and walk on the Leopard Trail. Some of the walking trails are better for seeing the animals up close versus the tram. Once you have done that, hop bak on the tram and finish the rest of the tram ride.

You can avoid the tram altogether and take the Fishing Cat trail at the start of the park. Its a nice walk.

If you make use of the shows, the walks and the trams, this is easily a relaxed way to pass 3+ hours on an evening. The animals are well kept, lit well and the staff guides do an excellent job of guiding your visit.

If you are hungry there is a great variety of food options outside the park. Re-entry is via the hand stamp. However, given the abundant food options in Singapore, I would suggest eating in town before you head out to the park. Arrive at the park for 6:30pm and your night will be a breeze. Take some bottled water and snacks and you'll be grateful.

Oh, one last thing. Don't use flash, It startles the animals but no matter how many times they repeat this, there are multiple people that continue to do this."
,,"Duh, too dark",3.0,,"The last time i was here was 10 years ago and i didn't particularly enjoy the experience nor was impressed. This time was no different. The lines were ok for a saturday night, it's crowded and busy, but not overly so

The ""star attractions"" of lion and tiger feedings are nothing more than watching them get thrown a piece of meat and you watch via a small glass window. That's a lot of people trying to see through a small space and no fun at all

You have the option of the walking trails or taking the tram, or perhaps a hybrid of both. The trails has a closer view of the animals, but it's very hot and humid (perhaps no fault of the night safari). The tram is breezier but you're further away

You see the usual suspects - tapirs, pigs, elephants, giraffes, hyenas etc. Perhaps they should really focus on the night animals like having a giant bat cave or something

The show at the amphitheatre was humorous and quite impressive, perhaps a 30min saving grace

Bring your own water/drink as a bottle of coke costs $5 here"
,,"Avoid school holidays, and no flash photography, please!",3.0,,"It got off to a bad start...we stayed for the Night Safari after visiting the zoo, and had dinner there. Who would've thought that chicken rice could cost $15, or a chicken tikka and naan set could cost $19? You're better of taking the public transport to one of the MRT stations and dining at the adjacent malls...
Also, maybe due to school holidays or New Year's Eve, the queue to enter the Night Safari was massive and we had to wait a long time just to enter.
Once we did get in, we were faced with new annoyances: tourists who happily used their camera flashes despite the risk for the animals' eyes! Perhaps the management needs to clearly state ""No flash photography"" with every ticket they sell, and place signs at the entrance to the trails. They did have signs, but only further in. Then, and only then, did those tourists turn off their camera flashes. By that time I imagine the fishing cats and mousedeer were all blind...
If we talk about the variety of animals and their habitats, I don't have any complaints about those. Some of the animals were too shy or adept at hiding, so being patient can pay off. Although my friends did complain that despite visiting the Night Safari numerous times, they had never seen some of the animals and wondered if they really existed!"
,,Must Visit!!,5.0,,This is a must visit place in Singapore.. Try to get in as soon as it opens to have a nice experience..
,,Night Safari,4.0,,"This was our first trip to Singapore and after hearing good reviews about the zoo and night safari we decided to book this.
The zoo is very clean and well maintained. Im not sure if it was because it was new years day which made it busier- but we waited 2 hours in line for the night safari. It was a awfully long & hot wait.
I did not think it was worth the wait.
The safari itself was ok- but I thought it would be better and a little more exciting than what is was.
I think for a family it would be great."
,,Great idea but guess the animals are not aware,3.0,,"This was a good ride from Singapore towards Malaysia border. There was a huge rush to get into the trams and the concept seemed like a great idea. As we went on the tram, a few things I noticed were - the person speaking was too soft for people at the back, there were animals but interestingly some of them were sleeping (so they were really not night creatures). Unfortunately we could make it to the show as it was full by the time we came back but this was as good as any zoo with the difference that we were seeing animals with lights"
,,A fun evening,4.0,,"It takes quite a long time to get to the safari, but it's worth it. From the MRT stop Yishun, you take a bus, and then it's a longish ride (depends on the traffic) - it took us around 45 mins to get there. At the safari, you get on a little train, which goes all around the park. A park guide tells you about the animals you go past, and it's very interesting. The enclosures are lit up so you see all the animals. Stay on the train until you're back at the start, don't get off in the middle! There are then various walks which take you past the enclosures again, and also to inside areas to see other animals.

I've knocked one point off the rating as there was no Information at the safari as to the last bus back to the MRT to catch the last train. None of the staff could help us either. And this information is really important as you don't want to have to get a taxi!"
,,"Fun, but bad crowd control.",4.0,,"The lines and the way the allow every one in at the same time, makes for hours long lines. the tour guide was easy to understand and very informative. It was very dynamic and interesting with tons to do and see. The downside is, while on the tram tour it is very difficult to get pictures since you are not allowed to ue flash, for fear of scaring the animals, but there are a few walking trails."
,,"Great idea, but avoid holidays!",3.0,,"This seems like a really fun thing to do, but it can get really crowded, as we learned over the Christmas holiday. Save your $s for a time when the zoo is less crowded, unless you don't mind long lines. We ended up skipping the tram ride and went on the alternate self guided walking tour, but even that was pretty crowded, though we got to see some cool animals."
,,Well worth the visit!,5.0,,"Excellent night zoo - it is well worth the visit. We got to see elephants, lions, tigers, lots of slow lorises, lots of mousedeers, rhinos, amongst other animals.

It seems far away on the map, but a taxi from the centre of town (ie. from Bugis Plus shopping mall) was only S$25. We went on the walking trails and also the the tram trail - it is worth going to both because you see different things on both trails.

We went on the walking trail first because there was a 2hr queue for the tram trail at the entrance, but we then hopped onto the tram about 1hr into the walk because there is the tram stop about 10 minutes into the tram ride where people can get on/ off the tram. We ended up queuing up for the first part of the tram ride and got off at the same stop where we originally got on - luckily the queue this time was only 5mins long this time.

My only feedback was that the queue for transport to get back into the city was very long - we queued for 1 hr for a taxi. We went on New Years night and so there were heaps of visitors to the night zoo. However, at least the line was moving fast.

Overall, definitely worth the visit! Much more interesting than a day visit to a zoo!"
,,Do not miss - a wonderful Singapore Experience,5.0,,"Not to be confused with the adjacent Singapore Zoo, the night safari is another experice altogether. Despite the guides saying do not use flash-photography, prepare to be disappointed with the number of clowns who ignore the instructions (despite the instructions being repeated in Malay, Bahasa, Mandarin/Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese and of course English). Do the tour and then go exploring for yourself."
,,Worth seeing! Lots of fun,5.0,,My partner and I decided to look around the place by ourselves (not a tour) and we really enjoyed it. About halfway through we jumped on the tram and got to see the animals that couldn't be seen by foot. The price was about what we would pay at home so we weren't surprised ($35 each). The whole place was really clean and nice and the conditions appeared good for the animals. We got to see the animals frolicking about which you never get to see during the day. We had lots of fun. Took about 45-1hr to get there but it was worth the wait. The buses/trains are super easy to follow so it wasn't a hassle for us.
,,Enjoyable evening crowded over holiday,4.0,,"This was an experience to see animals under dim lights that we would not be able to see unless travelling to Africa which coming from Canada is even further away. We were there on a weekend night , very busy. But the tour company we booked with gave us hints on how to organize the night . Do the tram first we were in line before it opened then you can see it all if it starts to rain at this time of year which it did . Take snacks , all the attraction prices are very expensive to eat at with small portions and ice cream is 10 bucks for 2 scoops . Do go and enjoy though it is worth it"
,,Many local animals,5.0,,"The safari on the little tram was great, especially as the fences are hidden by plants and darkness so that you have the feeling of lions or elephants standing right next to you. I also liked the walks, especially the one ""around"" Asia which displayed many local animals not shown in European zoos."
,,Not very easy to get there but so worth it,5.0,,"The park opens around 7pm, when we got there the line for the guided tram ride through the park along some of the animal encounters was awfully long, it took us almost an hour to get on the tram. We had read that it would be smarter to do the various walks through the park first and hop on the tram later and it would definitely have been wise to follow that advice. Next time we know better, after 9pm there was no waiting line anymore. The tram ride takes you through the park in the dark, deer, elephants, tigers, lions, mousedeer, hippos, and many more beautiful animals munching on delicacies while you drive by.
After the tram ride we did some of the walks to see even more cute, endangered, unusual and beautiful animals.
We took the MRT trains all the time except for this visit to the Night Safari, we took a cab instead. Taxis are waiting for guests after the visit so this is a very convenient way (20-30 min) to get there and back into the city.
The park was absolutely stunning and worth the visit."
,,Highly Over-rated,3.0,,"I went expecting to see nocturnal animals doing their thing instead all we saw were animals at night under artificial spot lights sitting around,not only did we pay nearly $40 for the privilege but we had to queue for close to an hour to do so.I just don't get it. The tour took approx 30 mins,was over before you new it and i didn't know so many species of Deer existed-they must be easy to catch because every second exhibit was a Deer of some sort. Add to that the time to get there and back and I can think of many better ways to spend the $-remember too the cost of getting there is not included in your ticket. Don't waste your money!"
,,Over hype,2.0,,"Too much hype on this attraction. Way too crowded. Zoo guides talk about confiscating cameras (invariably there will be few in crowd who use flash, and this is understandable too), while zoo doesn't seem to bother about the limitless crowd, flood lights or spot lights on animals, noise pollution through loud announcements."
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,"Best bet is to do the walks first, there are 3 or 4 of them, you see things you can't see from tram. After that, take the tram, by then most of the queues and crowds for it will gave gone, we got straight on, thereafter go to the show which is really not up to much.
It seems many are unable to walk, so just do the tram, which is good, but you should walk as well"
,,Nice experience,4.0,,The Night Safari is a different zoo experience since it is looking at the animals in the dark. The tram is a nice way to explore the area (30min round trip). The paths are nice and you get really close to some of the animals. The bat house is one of the more exciting ones. The wallaby house is more cosy. The Night Safari is located next to the zoo around a 20-30min car drive away from the city center.
,,Totally cool experience-Silver Medal!!!,4.0,,"After a day trip to Singapore Zoo, take a 3 minute walk to the Night Safari. This Christmas Season- they opened at 630 pm. Take the tram and see the different animals. No flash photography please and be quiet while admiring the beauty of the animals. Lions, Giraffes, Deers, Rhinos, Elephants, Hyenas, Wolves, etc. are just near you as your tram travels quietly in the whole vicinity. There are two shows- Creatures of the Night and Fire Eating Hunks at the entrance plaza. Photo ops with colorful dancers at the main entrance... Enjoy!!!"
,,The most unique zoo experience,5.0,,"Night Safari is a unique experience and i was quite kicked about the entire concept. There is a tram that will take you through the zoo and you can watch various animals from your seat. There are also 3-4 different walking trails. One should walk through this trails to see the animals not visible from the tram. The trails give you a creepy feeling as you walk through the foliage in the darkness with animals in your vicinity...

Reach early to take the tram first else the queue becomes very long and the waiting time can be as long as 1-1.5 hours

P.S - There are various combo offers which can give you access to all 4 attractions namely Jurong Bird park, Singapore Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari at a better rate. The Singapore Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari are in the same premises whereas the Jurong Bird park is at a distance of 20 kms hence covering all 4 parks in a single day is virtually impossible. Choose your combo passes wisely"
,,Queue and more queuing,1.0,,"We went there after dinner at Balestier and reached night safari at around 8PM. Long queue to get ticket took about 45 mins (which can be avoided if you buy ticket online using the free wifi). If you have a singapore airlines boarding pass, you'll get additional 15% off (not available online). Once inside, we again queue for the tram for another 40 minutes before the safari begin. Some of the spots are poorly dimmed and you can barely see the animals. We finished the whole experience by around 11PM, and as you can guess more queuing to catch a cab ride back to the hotel. In summary, queuing close to 3 hours to enjoy the 40 minutes safari is simply not worth the hassle."
,,Enjoyable but crazy queues,3.0,,"We visited the Night Safari on 30th December. It was excellent - it was so great to see the animals in a fairly natural setting. We did all of the walking paths and the tram ride.

The biggest issue was the queuing - we queued for an hour to get on the tram, after arriving at 7:30pm when the park opened. The queue was orderly which was helpful, but was very hot and the fans were inadequate to cool the crowds. In hindsight it may have been better to walk around the paths first - by the time we finished at 10:30pm there was a very small 5 minute queue so we were able to take the tram ride again.

We had bought a 2-in-1 pass including Jurong Bird Park, which meant that we didn't need to line up for tickets at the Night Safari. This proved to be a very good idea as others we met had also queued for a long time to purchase their tickets.

Bring your own food - soft drinks start at $4 and food options are expensive."
,,It's a one time thing,4.0,,"Like the Singapore zoo, the first visit is lots of fun and it actually feels pretty cool. When I went there the second time it wasn't exactly pleasant, it was extremely crowded and well the heat just makes things worse. I also got a feeling that the night safari was a journey through Singapore zoo from a different angle maybe. It just seemed fishy since they are almost adjacent and they even share some areas I believe."
,,Visit to Night Safari,4.0,,Night safari is one of the excellent attractions of Singapore. It was very nice - Seems even the animals are very disciplined in Singapore. Animal show was good but standards has deteriorated since I last visited.
,,enjoyed the trails,4.0,,"went with 2 young kids and when arriving at 7:30, were told that the show was already fully booked and the queues for the tram was extra long so we went for the trails instead which was great although a bit challenging for our 3 year old"
,,We waited over an hour in line.,2.0,,"We arrived at 7:15 pm with tickets in hand (booked online) but still waited in a massive line to enter and then to get on the tram. We started our tram tour at 8:30 pm. The show was full and we did not get to see it.

Sitting on a tram and driving quickly past animals is not a good way to enjoy a zoo. There are walking trials and I wish we had used them rather than the tram.

I was very disappointed in the Night Safari and will never return."
,,Fun for the whole fam,4.0,,"We went to the night safari with our kids and 2 of our friends. After seeing how crowded it was and the size of the line to get onto the tram, I was worried that we would spend all night in line, but it moved very quickly and I think we were in line less than 15 minutes.

We sat in the first row of the tram so we could hear the guide very well and even talk to him when he wasn't narrating, which was very nice.

The kids loved the animals and it was fun trying to spot them at night. It was a really neat experience because not all of the enclosures were completely closed so there were a few animals that could get out and wander around.

I really wanted to get off the tram and walk some of the other trails, but the kids had started to melt, so we ended up not doing it. I think it would have been worth it!"
,,Night at the zoo,4.0,,Great to see the animals at night. Long queues and the tour operators leave at 10pm - so we could not get on the tram for first night we visited. When we complained to the tour company they organised a second visit and the zoo staff gave us priority entrance to tram and show - and we just made it in the time the tour operators give for the visit. Do not go during the busy holiday periods - its a wasted trip.
,,"Way too crowded, but staff did a good job holding the show together",3.0,,"I brought a visiting guest to the Night Safari, and experienced the crowds, queues and high prices mentioned by other reviewers. A somewhat stressful experience, but I couldn't help noticing how friendly, upbeat and professional all the staff I came across were, in spite of all this. We decided to join the tram queue at the mid-point of the trail - we started queuing at 9 pm for the 9.30pm tram. Lots of trams came and went, and the tram meant for us finally stopped at 9.30. By then, the queue had grown into a long snake within the railing. Suddenly, a fit, tall tourist ran up from the side and jumped over the railing into the queue as we started boarding. At this point, the tram driver angrily shouted at him, 'DO NOT CUT THE QUEUE! GET INTO THE QUEUE.' I think everyone in the queue at that point were grateful the tram driver was bold enough to put the line-cutter in his place.

I hope the management seriously considers limiting the number of visitors to the zoo in any one night so that visitors can at least focus some attention on the animals than other zoo trippers. Have a visitor quota, make people book online in advance. Do something to improve the visitor experience."
,,Enjoyable night,3.0,,"The night safari has a good tram ride which is a good way to start.
Then there are 4 trails to explore - easy to get lost but all part of it.
The show was corny and not worth worrying about.
Although very touristy and a bit pricey, it is a pleasant thing to do in the evening after a hot day."
,,Amazing experience for the whole family,5.0,,"Our family loved the experience of seeing animals in their natural habitat at night. All the big ticket animals were there - elephants, lions, giraffes, and lots of less well known animals too. A very fun atmosphere with fire breathers and entertainers dressed as animals. We had to miss the animal show as there were too many people, so arrive early and avoid disappointment."
,,Different to a daytime zoo visit.,4.0,,"Again another amazing animal experience in Singapore. Kicking off in the evening, the place is super busy but so well managed you don’t feel too crowded in. I personally got more out of the day singapore zoo visit but this is something different to the standard day zoo offerings if you are thinking of doing just zoo or night safari. There are big queues for the shows here so line up early if you want to catch a session."
,,"Wasted time, money and goodwill",1.0,,"I should have known better & not even think of going during ""peak"" period. But hey, this is Singapore where things are supposed to be efficient, no? I think the Safari were just interested in your money. Pay SGD33 for a night full of crown, poor crowd control, lousy food at inflated prices, lousy food vendors...and they take SGD33 from literally thousands of people ensuring that you MAY get something if at all.

Queue to enter. Queue to try to get on trams for an hour. Decided to queue for the creatures of the night show. Full. Queued again. Cancelled due to an act of God a.k.a. rain. Had the most expensive chicken rice which was just above palatable. Queued again. Full. Please come later.

I think they should not have sold so many tickets when they know this will happen.

The short of it all, don't go. Certainly not during holiday season. You're just wasting time getting there & queuing up for....nothing. Sure, trails, trams, etc are there...but when its so crowded that you couldn't even push a baby pram or get a pram whacking your heels every few steps, I know there are better things to do with my precious time."
,,A good one if time permits,5.0,,"We visited the Night Safari straight after the zoo since it is located on the same premises. There are two options - The Tram and on foot also. We took the tram and the enitre experiance was wonderful. If you would like to see more closely, then see it on foot but it will be tiring since there are 4 different trails and the walk is quite a lot.

Night Safari has 2 shows: Thambuakar Performance (Fire Show) and the Creatures of the Night show. Both are worth it and we did both. If you doing the Night Safari directly after the Zoo, you could eat at Bongo Burgers which is located right at the entrance. And at the same place, you can see the Fire Show as well.

This is how we planned our visit:
Eat at Bongo Burgers, See the Fire Show, Enter the Night Safari and straight visit the Creatures of the Night Show. Post this, you could take the tram ride and see the Night Safari"
,,Ridiculous queues!,4.0,,"We visted the Night Safari tonight after reading the beautifully presented marketing material. What this brochure fails to tell you is that if you book for the tour, you will be picked up from your hotel at 6pm and not arrive at the safari until 8pm! On the bus they will then inform you the bus departs back to the city at 9.45pm! The real kicker here is that you will spend about 1 1/5 hours of this time in a queue to jump on the train. Unbelievable!!!! It also fails to tell you to eat beforehand because the queues for food at the start are crazy and at the end there is no time. If you have to visit a safari....it is definitely quicker to go to Africa!"
,,It's a different experience!,4.0,,"Ok. Am sharing what I experienced during SUPER PEAK PERIOD!!!!

Arrived there at 6.30pm and que for tickets for about 45minutes! Yes... I didn't want to purchase the tickets online coz it might rain and there goes your hard earned moolah!

Anyway, 45 minutes later I got the tickets. Headed to the entrance then que again. This time for 30 minutes till they let us in. Then, there are 2 options, ie 1 to walk around and the other is to que for the 'creatures of the night' show which will start in 1 hour! Which means you'll need to stay in line for 1 hour! If you want to que for the tram ride, you'll need to que for at least 2 hours!!!

Argh!!! I decided to bring my family to walk around first and thank God it was a wise decision. Walked around and covered 2 'parks'. Just in time for me to que for the show which I waited for just 30 minutes. Got good seats too! After the show, went straight to the tram and waited about 30-40minutes. Not too bad.

You must take the tram ride coz you'll get to see the animals which you can't if you walk through. The tram ride will take approx 40 minutes (non stop). I know I've read a few reviews that it's a waste of time to go to the night safari as the animals are mostly asleep. However, I got to see most of the animals in action!

The tram ride was so good that my young kids wanted a second round which Took us only 5 minutes to que! But that time was already 11pm! Once completed, we exited the park at 11.45pm!

Well, my 'nightmare' hasn't ended yet when I saw the que for taxis was pretty long! From the judge of the length of the que, it may take at least 45minutes for our turn as there were less taxis at that hour of the night!

Eventually, we managed to grab a cab and head back.

So, in summary, it was a good experience on the park. I guess the que was unavoidable as this is the SUPER PEAK season everywhere! So, if anyone is going this week, be prepared for the long que. However, if you follow my way, you might get around it. Also, don't go back so late if you need to take a cab!"
,,Something different,4.0,,Long queues firslty. Not too bad once you're on the safari vehicles. Good entertainment. Options to get off and walk with lots of animals to see. Pretty hard to get good pictures as no flash allowed in the park. Great fire show. All round good experience. Food and drinks are very expensive here so take snack or go on a full stomach.
,,Queue,1.0,,"Overcrowded and overhyped,, too many people, takes an hour to get in the place, and that is when you have a ticket, chaotic and disorganized. Very expensive for what it is. Shall not return"
,,Disenchanted,2.0,,"For sure we saw 'Creatures of the Night' at the Night Safari. The species' name? Homo Sapiens! Humans, humans, and more humans. My family group of 13 visited the Night Safari on 27th Dec 2013. It must have been the peak of the peak busy period for the Safari. Our advice to our international visitors is to avoid coming to the night Safari during the peak holiday periods when school holidays of Asian countries coincide with major seasonal holidays like Christmas and New Year. In my opinion, the Night Safari does not have the capacity to handle the sheer number of visitors I witnessed. They had to temporarily suspend entrance of the later batch of visitors at around 8-8.15pm. There was a crush of people waiting for the trolley with long lines snaking throughout the entrance. The queues, whilst orderly, were not elderly or children friendly. There were old people who clearly were suffering from standing on their feet for so long. There should have been a priority queue for the elderly, families with young children, regardless of nationality. Instead, we saw priority queue for Japanese tourists who got on to trolleys quite easily whilst the majority of visitors from around the world looked on. Thank God it was a cool night for if the night had been hot, it would be very stuffy under the tents that have only small fans for ventilation. The staff manning the trolley queue were trying their utmost to keep order, shouting themselves hoarse. I fault the Safari Management for not equipping the staff better, for accepting too many tour bookings and for not providing better signage for visitors. The sign that said ""minimum 40min wait for trolley"" was hidden somewhere in the queue and by the time we saw it, it was too late to back out as we were already 30 min into the queue and there was a crush behind us. If we had seen the sign earlier, we could have made the decision to walk instead of taking the trolley. We waited 60 min in the trolley queue only for a 20 min ride around the Safari. At the end of the ride, our children were too tired from the standing in the queue to walk around the Safari, thus we left for home.

Whilst the views of the animals and commentary of the Safari on the trolley was good, I didn't think it was worth the wait in the queue. My advice to visitors is to walk through the Safari at your own leisure if you can and avoid the Creatures of the Night show which was a complete waste of time. All in all, the trip to the Night Safari was a disappointment."
,,Ridiculous queue,1.0,,"I know that Singaporeans LOVE a queue but tonight it was completely insane. Only 5 out of 10 ticket booths were open on one of the busiest weekends of the year. And the result, the longest queue known to man. For a country recognised for efficiency, this was a deeply frustrating experience. And never recommending this place to anyone again"
,,"Queues, queues and more queues.",1.0,,"Never in my life have I had my patience texted to this limit! We spend more 3/4 of our time queuing to get in and for each of the attractions and about 1/4 of our time there actually on the night safari. We were an adult couple visiting - this is definitely more aimed at children (although how the poor blighters coped with all the queuing and so late at night, I don't know). Don't go early, as others have suggested (unless you're planning on getting there before opening time) - I'd suggest going late (10pm onwards). As we were eventually leaving (about 11pm), the queues were much smaller in comparison. We felt this was a wasted evening. Very disappointed."
,,Tram experience was great but visit marred by other disappointments,3.0,,"The tram ride to view the animals in an open setting was a nice experience. However, it is time to revamp the Creatures of the Night Show. When we arrived, there were at least 3 rows of seats in the centre block which had ""Reserved"" signs on it and the staff told us these were reserved. However, about 5 minutes before the show started, the signs were suddenly removed. This didn't make sense as it deprived those who arrived earlier of the better seats. Having seen similar shows in other countries, I think this show lacks creativity and does not really stand out. The poor condition and state of hygiene of the toilets was another disappointment. We visited the ladies' toilets in different parts of the park but most of the toilet cubicles had toilet paper strewn all over the floor and the floors were rather dirty. The park management should be well famliar with huge turnouts during the holiday season and have the toilets cleaned often during the park opening hours. Overall, I would say that it is time to revamp the Night Safari if it wants to justify its ranking as one of the top Singapore attractions. For the ticket price that we pay, I expect to be charged a nominal fee for parking but sadly the parking fees were absurdly expensive."
,,Great night out in the jungle,5.0,,"I was pretty suprised there was a jungle still in singapore while doing the night safari. The park is a decent size and could be covered within 2/3 hours.
Some of the animals roam freely on the park and could get pretty close to the trails."
,,Way too crowded,3.0,,"The first mistake I made was to visit both the zoo and the night safari in the one day. The second was to visit them on Christmas Eve. The queue was horrendous. We must have stood for close to an hour.

That aside, you have a choice of tours - guided walking, non-stop tram or hop on and off tram.

The information from the tour guides is informative, but I do not recommend this for young families."
,,A very different zoo experience,4.0,,"My husband and I visited the Night Safari straight after a day at Singapore Zoo. This was such a different zoo experience. We started our evening with dinner (satay sticks) which was delicious and watching the fire show. Once the park opened we were recommended to see the Creatures of the Night demonstration first because the line for the trains is very long. This was a great recommendation and entirely accurate. We found the wait for the trains half an hour after opening time to be much less. Although the variety of animals is more limited compared to the zoo, it is such a great experience being able to see the animals at night.The train tour is excellent and undeniably the best way to see majority of the park.

We went along one of the walking paths which was enjoyable, however after a day at the zoo, we were both too tired to take real advantage of more of these.

Overall, a worthwhile experience. Depending on how much you want to see, you should expect to spend at least 2 hours in the park if you don't do any of the walking trails, and 3+ hours if you do the walking trails."
,,Huge queues!!,3.0,,"We did the night safari following our trip to the zoo. We had 1.5 hours between the time the zoo closed and safari opened. We are dinner on the eatery by the safari ""Ulu Ulu"". The meals were just okay, nothing special for the expense (about $17 per meal, not including drinks). My suggestion is bring your own drinks and snacks.

Now, MAKE SURE YOU ARRIVE EARLY AND GET IN LINE!!!! we waited for over 2 hours! Also, there is a queue for the safari and one for the animal show, so make sure you're in the correct queue.

Viewing the nocturnal animals in an open setting was very nice but i don't know if I'd do it again.

We found it to be very disorganised and chaotic. People push in all over the place and there are multiple queues so you need to make sure you're in the right one."
,,not a thrilling experience,3.0,,the animals are the same as in our country but the hype has been created to attract tourists thus we can say that singapore is good in marketing
,,Singapore night safari,4.0,,"This is an amazing experience, the animals are really close and the evening is very calm and well organised. We took the tram around the park and then did all of the walking trials.
On the down side food and drink is really expensive if you eat at the outlets there."
,,be early there !!!!!!!,3.0,,"we went at 10 p.m and tram came at 10.30 pm . The ride was good and different experience to see animals .but after the ride when we went for a walk , we were wondering where the animals are????????we came to know that they move all the animals back at 11 p.m . when we came out ,they asked to move before 11.30 p.m because they wanted to close. but in the internet they have mentioned the timings as 7.30 p.m-12.m.n daily."
,,Good Experience,4.0,,"Visited Night safari during our trip to singapore in Dec, 2013. We had a nice time at the safari. First in line was the Animal of the night show for about 20 mins. After that we took the tram and it was about 30 mins ride to visit the entire Park. You could also walk along the walking trails if you want to. We saw many animals in open, was a pretty unique experience. The tickets were little pricey, but overall a good visit."
,,Fantastic Night Out,4.0,,"Lucky enough to have a family member in Singapore and feeling rather jet lagged, my wife and I were whisked off to the Singapore Zoo surroundings and we went onto the night safari. When arriving at the Night Safari, make sure to go to the show first as, as soon as the gates open at 7ish, most people head straight to the tour.

The tour itself is a great opportunity to just put the camera down and enjoy seeing the animals up close and how they are acting at night. Even the elephant at the end put on a show for us.

It's a great thing to go and see and definitely a worthwhile thing to visit when in Singapore."
,,The pride and joy of Singapore,5.0,,A wonderful place to go at night peace and tranquility with so many different animals. So quiet not a sound.
,,Excellent even in the rain,5.0,,"We visited in the midst of a proper singapore thunder storm. The shows were cancelled, but the trams ran and the trails were open. The place was very busy at first, but it seemed like most people only did one tram ride then left. We stayed and walked, and were even joined by a delightful member of staff for much of our walk who explained things brilliantly to the children.
The animals didn't mind the rain, nor did we! It was an absolutely fabulous visit."
,,Interesting experience,5.0,,"Had a great time..Started with the tribal dance at the entrance, the show inside and then completed the ride to see the animals. They have most of the animals and it was great to see them active at night..There were a few walking trials and we had the option to get down and walk in the trials to see some creatures inside..The Creatures of the Night Show was brilliant as well..nice performance by the animals, staff followed by a good message for the audience. All the staff are very friendly and informative which adds to the experience."
,,Excellent Fun,5.0,,"Highly recommended. The animals are so much more active at night. Get off the tram and walk around when you can. The bat enclosure was the highlight for me. Staff are very friendly and informative, and the entire place has a fun atmosphere."
,,Best to see as soon as you arrive in the tropics!,5.0,,"This is the best! Cool in the evening and the animals are all nocturnal so they are frolicking!!! Arrive at 8, not at 7 when it first opens and stay later after all have left and it is still open. You will be amazingly alone with the animals if it is a week night and not school holidays."
,,Nite safari good times,4.0,,"Had a good time , Certainly different at night , Shame pictures don't come out too well , No flash allowed , which is understandable , $35 Singapore £17.50 , Nice people good staff!!!!"
,,Night Safari,1.0,,"I was convinced to go by this trip advisor page and the DK book on Singapore. I would normally not visit a zoo but because, I am here I decided to visit it. The zoo has a typical animal show displaying only four or five animals in the most cliched way imaginable. The tram ride was not much better as I have seen the majority of animals before both in their natural environments and in zoos. The experience felt fake and one felt as if one were to be processed in a sossage machine.

Don't waste your money on this experience unless you haven't seen many wild animals before or you have an obsession with visiting zoos."
,,Pleasantly Surprised,5.0,,"We heard mixed reviews about the Night Safari, and went with limited expectations.
It was, however, much much better than we expected. One takes a tram ride (about
a 50 minute circuit) around the Zoo in the dark. It's cooler than daytime, and the animals are
awake and active. Some of tame ones actually come very close to the tram. The
guide on the tram was actually articulate and informative. After the tram ride, there
are some short walking trails that are interesting (15-20 minutes each). The food
concessions are mediocre (eat before or after). The ice cream stand is good.
We took the Metro, then bus, to the zoo - a tedious one hour. Take a taxi instead."
,,Something different,4.0,,"I went with wife and kids , it is a change from a regular zoo visit and something unusual and unique"
,,Surprisingly good but maybe because it was quiet,4.0,,"I had heard mixed reviews about this experience and were in 2 minds about going but our 5 year old really liked the idea of the ""night zoo"".

I was surprised how much we enjoyed it. We started with the tram ride which was very crowded (about 30 min wait at a quiet time of year, can't imagine what it would be like in peak season) and this was okay. It was hard to see some of the animals, especially for our son, and the tram doesn't really stop just keeps moving very slowly, so depending what carriage you are in you may or may not get a good view (I would recommend the middle carriage) of the various animals.

However the walking trails were great, there was hardly any one on them so you could get a good view of the various animals. Like all zoos how much you see of the animals depends on them (and some luck) - eg. we were lucky enough to be at the leopard enclosure when one of the cats was sitting right at the window.

I was pleasantly surprised at how active some of the animals were and the atmosphere just provided at different perspective on the normal zoo experience.

The tram ride took a little over 30mins and then walking the various trails another 1.5hrs (this was with a small child and stopping to look at various animals). The only trail we didn't spend much time on was the wallaby trail being from Australia we didn't need to go all the way to singapore to see a few kangaroos :)

I would definitely say DO NOT do this on the same day as the zoo - just too tiring."
,,.. ZOOLANDER ..,3.0,,"Singapore zoo is one of the better quality zoos in the world; only in daylight hours do you see the animals at their best in their natural habitat . My husband and I went on the night safari ,but were disappointed we could not use our camera ,as the flash would disturb the roaming animals . Several parents found their children restless in the dim surroundings . With younger children, take them during the day..."
,,Interesting and different animal experience.,4.0,,"This safari lasts about 40 minutes if you just do the trolley ride. There are also 4 optional extra walks which take about 15 minutes each.
Whilst seated in the trolley you are driven around in the dark and given lots of information about the animals in each enclosure (or roaming free) as you pass them. We saw many animals at each place. Visibility is good and the animals look totally relaxed. No flash photography is allowed and everybody actually obeyed this rule.
Queues started building up about 40 minutes before the first safari (which we were on) but I think things moved pretty quickly. There were definitely no queues when we returned.
Our particular trolley did not stop to let people off to do a couple of the walks but you can do some of them from the starting area. We didn't as we saw sufficient from the trolley.
If you like animals this safari is well worth doing."
,,Night safari,4.0,,"First time to night safari even though three times I and My family visited Singapore. It takes 35 minutes by taxi to the night Zoo. After the entrance you can see an action by three persons of doing fire show, that they blow and put the fire in the mouth. Then we are queue to the mini train that it takes aboutI think one hour to look around the jungle of night safari. Woow... there you can see many animals ( Lions, tigers,cows and others). Its very nice, then after that we go to the shop to buy souvenier for the gifts, food and juices. In the night safari I suggest to you all using cannon EOS600D without flash. Its very clear even though night safari."
,,Night Safari,4.0,,The show at the zoo was brilliant. The zoo and the animals were good. The commentary could have been better though
,,A great experience,5.0,,"This was a great experience. We did the tram ride first and then walked in the trails. Anyone who visit will enjoy to their full heart. I missed the show ""creature of the night safari"" but from what i heard its pretty good. So don't miss it if you are planning to visit."
,,A great tour to do whilst in Singapore!,5.0,,This was a great tour. We were picked up from the hotel and dropped off after. There is not enough time to eat therefore I would just recommend the tour not the food package. We did a train ride and then walked 2 of the trails. Great to see a zoo in the evening. We felt very close to the animals.
,,Trip to Night Safari,5.0,,"This was my second visit to the Night Safari. I enjoyed it with full heart. The arrangements, facilities and the overall experience in the tram was good. The show ""creatures of the Night Safari"" was awesome"
,,A different kind of zoo experience,4.0,,"This is a very novel way of seeing of seeing the nocturnal behavior of animals. We went on a weekday evening which was fairly empty, with almost no line for the tram ride or the animal show. Most of the animals were visible despite the low light levels, although a few were hidden away in the shadows. We loved the bears crashed out asleep on rocks and in trees! The walking trails are pretty atmospheric with all the animal noises coming from the darkness. The animal show was fun and worth half an hour of your time."
,,Such a Unique Experince... too bad no good photos,5.0,,"We were on a Tour East Tour to the Night Safari. We first had the included dinner which I recommend if you are booking the package. It was excellent and surprisingly had lots of selection. I especially liked the satay, and the ice cream for dessert. There is also self serve water which is much appreciated when you drink as much as I did because of the hot climate.
The line for the tram can be anywhere from 1min to 2hours. Luckily this time it was only 5min; the last time I was there it was over an hour. It is a fantastic tour of the park. You see so many animals. Some you never heard of. Some you never saw in that type of atmosphere. There are no walls or glass enclosures so you really see them up close and personal. For certain species, there is water between you and the animals, so there are no lions actually biting off your hands. It felt safe, but I would not want to put my hands out of the tram. The guides are very informative and make the trip special. They know what they are doing and the tourist love them. I love the little bits of environmentalism they throw into their orientations. We also did a walking trail which was fantastic.
We went to the flame show, where a tribe shoots fire from their mouths. It was something so different; not like what you would see back home. There was also another show that we hurried to and it was to show off the animals with a little bit of audience participation. There were lots of shops, but the prices are better downtown for souvenirs. Skip the fish pond and go to the Kenko Fish Spa at the Singapore Flyer for a real experience.
Actually, this is the first place in Singapore where I say skip the shopping and enjoy the tour.
Since you cannot take flash photos, and it is night time, you are better off putting away your camera altogether and simply enjoy the tram ride without distractions!
Would go back in a heartbeat."
,,Night Zoo,3.0,,"We should of known that a night zoo meant you can't see much, but still it was a cool experience. I just wished we had opted for a visit during the day as well."
,,"Very crowded, no flash photography",3.0,,"With an excellent tour guide, Linda Chan. Very fast pace through walking trails and one hour wait for tram. Zoo is very dark and animals are difficult to see."
,,A must see in Singapore,4.0,,"This is a unique attraction of seeing the wild life in the evening, when they are more active. We only toured the zoo by tram, but think that if you have the time walking the pathways would be excellent. In the tram we got pretty close to many of the animals (the non-predatory ones).

The only downer of this tour was that there were some very inconsiderate people who continued to use their camera flash even though they were told repeatedly not to do so. In addition they continued to talk very loud and laugh even though they were asked to keep the noise down. I really wish that the staff would have removed them, but otherwise was a good experience.

Would highly recommend this to everyone, but ask that you be considerate of the others."
,,a different experience,5.0,,This was a different experience for us especially for our two teen aged children. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit - from the show to the walking trails and the tour around the zoo. The kids were full of anticipation and were excited considering that all the activities were done at night time. Highly recommended.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"It's not often that I'm wowed by a zoo, but this one did it. Would give it 4.5 to 5 stars. Would have liked to have seen the layout in the daytime.

Similar to Singapore Zoo with moats and no fences to display the animals. You can easily walk around the walking tracks to view the animals, and into some walk through enclosures. There is also a tram that goes around the entire zoo. This is a long ride for a zoo, and it does border on a bit too long for kids, but it is interesting. I recommend doing the walk and the tram as you will see different animals on both. I did think their planning was a bit off as the walking tracks cross the tram road in a few places and they have to have staff stationed to make sure you're safe crossing. The enclosure design for the most part is fantastic, especially how they have combined walking tracks and a tram road and still managed to hide a lot of the moats. Wasn't too fussed on the glass fronted enclosures during the walk. It is all low light, but adequate for finding everything - plus it adds to the ambience of the zoo. Great at night as it isn't quite as hot as being out in the daytime. Kids loved not knowing what was coming up round the corner and a good mix of enclosure styles so as to not bore you.

The food and alcohol at the start was ridiculously expensive so be prepared if you're eating there. Tickets are reasonable if you do a combo with the other day zoos.

The only thing that soured the whole experience right at the very end was seeing four out of four elephants pacing/swaying stereotypically in their two or three different elephant areas, as well as two male lions pacing at the back of two different enclosures (I think the lion enclosures may have backed onto eachother so that could account for the lions and no biggie as lions will pace sometimes for good reason). I have no knowledge of elephants in captivity, so just an observers opinion.

Overall a very good zoo and will visit again."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,This is so great! Riding the tram through the park with no barriers between you and the animals is an experience not to be missed. There are many pre-arranged tours you can book through various reputable operators.
,,A unique experience not to be found elsewhere,5.0,,"I will declare it - I like the Night Safari a lot. I think it is a unique destination, and the animal enclosures are expertly constructed to look very natural and appealing. If you look past the kitsch shops and shows at the entrance foyer, and the sometimes odd accents of the tour guides, and instead just focus on the animals and their environment, it is a wonderful experience. The animals roam their spaces freely, which are bounded by moats rather than fences, and this gives the Safari a nice open feeling all round. The electric tram is wonderfully quiet, and you got some lovely vistas of the elephants, lions and deer, among others. The lighting everywhere is wonderfully subtle and is done with a light touch, so that the night time environment is highlighted rather than destroyed. I find the tram ride relaxing, it is a pleasure to move around at night in the cool air and enjoy the sights. Tip - get some anti-mosquito cream or spray to avoid being bitten. Highly recommended."
,,Pricey but worth it,4.0,,"Great. Took the tram ride and thoroughly enjoyed it. The tour guide was enthusiastic and informative and we saw a ton of animals despite the low level of light.. Walked a couple of the trails afterwards which were also great. My main regret is not having enough time to go to the animal show or to have been able to go to the main zoo (separate locations).

The food and drinks are ridiculously overprice though- bring your own if you are on a budget."
,,Pleasant experience,5.0,,"If you want to the animals in zoo without cage and with out any fear is open tram and that to in night, then I would say you Night Safari is the best place. You can see animals very next to you be it a deer or the King of animals Lion.
Also enjoyed the shows conducted here."
,,"""I'm not into zoo's but I recommend this one""",4.0,,"The fire show at the start was very good & made an interesting scene whilst we ate dinner. Then we looked at going on the train but the cue was so long so we decided to walk the trail which was not strenuous and as it was night time, not too hot either. The trail took us about 2 hours as we were in no hurry and stopped and saw everything. Many animals I didn't even know were on this planet.

When we were back at the start, there was no cue for the train and we contemplated the ride on the train, thinking we had seen it all anyway maybe we would give it a miss - we decided to go on the train and I'm so glad we did as it took us on another trail and we saw many more animals that all seemed to be roaming freely and looking content.

Allow a good hour to get there and another hour if you want dinner without rushing."
,,Lovely experience- it depends though on the tourists you are with,4.0,,"Fist we went to the show with the animals of the night. This is absolutely stupid, I don't know, how anyone could waste his time with this show! It has nothing, really nothing to do with nature and animals of the night. It is just a show with poor animals, so after half of the time we left.
Afterwards we went to the night safari. This we could enjoy more, although there are so many tourists from all over the world who just can't imagine, that this is not a disney park but real animals of the night who might get disturbed by flashlights or big noise, although the staff keeps repeating this in any language and it is written everywhere.
It was beautiful, to see so many animals feeding and walking about in the dark. Like in nature, we had to look for the animals, trying hard to spot them in the halflight. We were not able to see all of the animals, but this is ok in a park like this, where the animals are not held in cages. That is nature. This park is very nicely made, to give a glimpse into the night world, although it is of course still a zoo. We walked the whole hiking path, so we were able to leave a bit the chatty crowds of the tourists. The second part of the tramride was even more beautiful, people were quiet and watching in awe."
,,"Nice, but not ""All weather""",4.0,,"Singapore Night safari is one of the most suggested place to visit in Singapore. So we booked a park hopper for River safari an Night safari for the family.

We took the taxi from Sentosa, as I realized this is the best way to get to the Safari parks specially with young kids. Bus and MRT all require transfers and changes. Taxi is a bit cost effective specially if you can fill up the taxi (4 adults or 2 adults and 3 kids, etc.).

Prices of food from the restaurants in Night safari is a bit high, but when you are there already you have almost no choice but to eat there.

The animals were quite interesting, Tram tour was nice, Show was okay an entertaining. The biggest problem is, the park is not ""All weather"", one would imagine that Singapore being used to a Rainy season, should have parks planning for such season. Nov and Dec almost surely will have rain showers. So why didn't the night safari just put some cover on their walkways to protect visitors from the rain. Unfortunately for us, it was raining till night time when we visited. Tram ride was fairly dry of course, but some of the animals were sheltering from the rain. Luckily the rain stopped during the show, but started to drizzle again when we did the walk through. If only they just covered the walk through path, people can still view the animals without the need for umbrellas and raincoats. Do not get me wrong I am not afraid of getting wet, but we had kids and bags and strollers that get soaked. The River safari was better, it was raining hard when we were there, and we stayed dry because it was almost all covered."
,,A great evening.,5.0,,"I have visited the Night Safari on two occasions now, once with my family which includes young children and most recently with an adult travel companion. It was a very enjoyable experience on both occasions. On my family visit, we arrived at the start of one of the scheduled Fire Shows - an energy charged Fire Eater show which really sets an exiting tone for the evening. Trams depart from the main entrance area to transport visitors around the greater park area where you cannot access by foot. We decided to walk the trails first, which I found thoroughly enjoyable and very relaxing. The walk trails are very well laid out and signposted and are cleverly lit so as not to detract from the night time experience. They meander through a jungle setting with numerous viewing areas from which to observe the nocturnal animals. Some of the viewing areas are out in the open while others are enclosure type areas with a perspex viewing window, again very well laid out and cleverly lit. It was very interesting to watch the animals go about their business. My children were very excited when searching for the animals in the viewing areas and when observing them. There are also walk in enclosures which offer the opportunity to view animals such as bats. The fact that is night time adds an ambience to the whole experience. The jungle setting provides a cooling effect on a balmy evening and crickets and other insects provide a symphony of sound in the background, both adding to the overall experience.
After we had completed some of the walk trails, we took a Tram tour of the rest of the park to see the larger nocturnal animals. This was a great experience, with the tram taking us for a quite extensive tour of the park to view elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo and other large animals. For us, it was a prefect combination of walking and vehicle transport.
There is a food and beverage area with several food outlets offering a variety of different choices such as Asian & Indian meals. Pricing is typical of this type of venue wherever you go. There are other food outlets outside of the main Night Safari entrance area.
Overall, it was a great experience - a must for children, especially if they have an interest in wildlife."
,,Very much depends on the weather,3.0,,"It was raining, quite hard and that put a stop to most of the fun as we had to wait around for ages for the mini train to re-open which takes you around the park. Food & drink was limited and expensive. It might sound stupid but the fact that it's a night safari is a bit of a stupid idea unless you've been eating your carrots. They can't light the enclosures up too much which in turn means you can't see too much. If you have nothing else to do then go for it."
,,A good evening out . . .,5.0,,"Although a little way out of the city, a trip here makes for a good evening out. The evening theme of seeing animals is a nice variation on traditional zoo.

There are two ways to visit the inhabitants: by tram or on foot. One needs to do both to see everything. Visitors rush to the tram at the opening with a resultant long queue so it is better to visit some areas on foot and come back to the tram after it has calmed down.

The commentary on the tram is good and engaging; the proximity to the animals is excellent;

There are several eating facilities which are ok and reasonable value."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Unique experience - incredible to see the animals at night!

Went around via the tram first then the walking trails to get the best experience, creatures of the night show also worth seeing!

Not as good in terms of animal variety and photo opportunities as the main zoo but well worth a visit!"
,,Great attraction for all,5.0,,"I am a local and have been there numerous times, mostly just outside and once inside.
For me and my family, the atmosphere outside is electric and energetic, there are free shows just outside the night safari. With that, you can also enjoy your dinner. We truly enjoyed ourselves every-time we are there just being outside and there is no fee for that.
We went into the night safari once and unfortunately, there were not much animals to see at that point of time, however we enjoyed the experience of walking in the ""wild jungle"" There are marshals all along the way guiding you, so one will never get lost.
For tourist, would be good if you do not go to the Zoo and Night Safari on the same day if you have the time. It is just too much to see and enjoy in one day."
,,Nice Place,4.0,,"It was good. Took around 1 Hrs to reach from my hotel. It was raining all the time which made the animals go into shelter and we were not able to see many of them. Walking trails are good, purchased a rain coat @ SGD 10 to enjoy the trails. It was a good experience."
,,Really nice experience !!!,4.0,,"We went first to Night Safari & later to the Zoo. It was a half an hour tram ride + 3-4 trails if you want to explore it on your own. They have done it quite well with lights at the right places. It's not much intruding to animals & you can really see them in their natural shelter. Animals did not look caged. You won't be able to see as much animals in Night Safari as in Zoo but still it's a different experience to go through in night.

We caught the 9.30 show as well. Please see the show timings before you go so that you won't miss it. These interactive shows are what you will enjoy most with some surprises thrown in between. There are also a lot of photo opportunities with statues of various animals."
,,Fun and educational,5.0,,"Started the evening with fire shows and also some animals display. We took the tram tour and also walk to get up close and personal. Animals look healthy, the place itself is very clean. Everything is well labeled. Staffs were courteous and helpful. Well done guys.... :)"
,,Awesome Awesome Awesome,5.0,,"Been to Singapore Night Safari now 3 times and would go again.

Very professional experience friendly knowledgable guides.

Perfect organised safari experience dependant on how curious the animals are you can be literally 3 metres from a Rhino, Bengal tiger, Elephant and be totally safe.

There are 2 walking tours which take you inside the safari which are good plenty to see fruit bat enclosure and flying squirrels are for the more adventurous but lots of fun to be had looking at all of the animals in there different habitats.Walked trough a wallaby enclosure and i was only 30 cm away from them which was an en lightening experience.

Would recommend to everyone to go!!"
,,loved it,4.0,,"Was a very interesting experience. Having to see these beautiful animals in the night create for an amazing atmosphere, especially in their natural surroundings. The tour does require some planning however its worth it for a fun night out in Singapore."
,,Unique experience,3.0,,"Book ticket in advance through Internet, else be prepared to wait in long queue during public holidays and peak season. In the Internet booking website, it is not clearly mentioned that ticket price includes tram ride. Do not worry, it includes tram ride as well.

When it is very crowded, the tram will make one full round without stopover at z'bar. If you are lucky and the tram does make a stopover at z'bar, spend sometime walking around that area and don't miss out following:
-Giraffe
-Fruit bats enclosure
-Flying fox enclosure

Keep your camera ready when you are inside flying fox and fruit bat enclosures. Don't be alarmed when the creatures fly close to you, they are harmless and not a cause for concern.

For Indian vegetarian folks, there is an Indian restaurant near the entrance. It is filthy expensive. Better option is to pack your food and eat there. There seems to be no restriction on having outside food but please clean up after you finish your finish your dinner.

Z'bar does not have full fledged restaurant, they offer only snacks and refreshments. Restaurants are all located close to main entrance.

Don't miss out creatures of the night show. This show takes place on fixed times and there are only limited seats available. Try to reach the amphitheater atleast 10-15 mins before the show starts.

Also don't miss out fire dance show at main entrance. This show is free of charge and don't have to purchase night safari ticket to watch this.

Kids stroller is allowed and can be placed in tram."
,,night safari is a must see,5.0,,"Singapore zoo is excellent, and I would recommend the night safari in lieu of the normal visit. You tour the whole zoo in a tram train, so no walking, and you see numerous animals right beside you and they are all in a natural outdoor environment, all with strategic lighting for viewing. I am not a zoo person but went with my grandchildren and we all enjoyed it. It can get busy, but trains leave every few minutes to keep the queue moving. It is very well organized"
,,Well worth doing but ...,4.0,,"Enjoyed the tram ride and the animals were simply beautiful especially the spotted deers. If you are really into taking your photos best be prepared with night equipment as no flash photography allowed - note to staff you may want to ask people not to use flash photography and mobile phones in languages in addition to English as not all your guests understand English. The show is my 'but' on this review - totally lost me by having an animal demonstrate recycling techniques, felt more like a circus show. Despite this, I would recommend the night safari as its beautiful experience despite some content of the show."
,,Top experience!,5.0,,"This is so well planned! Just follow the path through the trails. Recommend taking the tram later in the evening, wish we had to avoid the crowding & school groups. However the trails were uncrowded when we went through after doing the tram so that was good. Unfortunately many people could not understand the signs which show no flash photography and not to tap on the windows, also the unwritten rule to not speak loudly; or they are just too stupid. If you be wuiet you will spot the animals.
We took a taxi to get here and thought it might be difficult to get back but there were many waiting when we left.
First time we have ever seen a rhinoceraus and there were THREE! Loved it!"
,,Loved the night safari!,5.0,,We actually shared a bottle of wine outside while watching the fire show. Then we went on the night safari. You could really see the animals active at night. I would highly recommend this. It was a very unique and special experience.
,,Tram Ride & Night Show,4.0,,"Took the tram ride on Sunday evening. Long queue for the ride but the queue moved fast. It was a good night with breeze therefore the ride was not hot. No flash photography is allowed as it would scare the animals. We spotted quite a number of animals mainly of deer species. Some animal habitats were smelly but this is natural.

The animal night show was packed with people. It is interesting as the performance was by a group of small animals such as otter and civet."
,,Something different,4.0,,"The night safari was just like most zoos but with it being at night it felt completely different. The park wasn't to crowded and all the animals looked more lively then they do in most zoos. I also thought the bat cage was great, you se all the bats flying round past your face it was nice to get close to them. I would advise anybody going to do the walking trails first as everybody queues for the tram ride at the start and after you've completed the trail the queues are almost gone."
,,A well designed attraction,4.0,,We had previously visited the Taiping Night Safari in Malaysia but the Singapore Night Safari is a class above. The animal attractions were well designed to entice visitors to take up the evening stroll around this zoo compound. Best to discover this area by foot and make sure you have good walking shoes on to walk around for at least 3 hours. We managed to catch the fire performance which was enthralling.
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Went on the night safari at the zoo. A really good trip to see the animals in their natural surroundings and not behind bars
,,Line up!!!,3.0,,"Ss it is the first ""nocturnal"" wildlife park, I am amazed by their ability to create a park which is comfortable for both animals and human. Shows were also amazing. The animals on the tram ride is hard to see but overall, good. I would rate the zoo 4 star if they can make lines shorter. Faster lines to get tickets would be a great advantage. The zoo should alsoo limit the number of people visiting. As it is a relatively small zoo, I recommend to limit the cus5omer comint or expand the zoo. Lastly, I wish the zoo would make their animals enclosure mote synchronized as I do not understand the theme. First you are in the mountain, then you are in africa? When it first open, it might be great. But now it is an average zoo without uniqueness. Over all, they should remodel the zoo to make the zoo better."
,,Good experience,4.0,,"I think you have to manage your expectations a bit with this attraction. You do get to see animals close up and more active than during the day, so that's good. Tram isn't very exciting, but then it's not a theme park ride. Very accessible for people with mobility problems. Fire show was disconcerting! Strong smell of petrol and lots of spitting flames. Depends if you like this kind of thing I guess. We ate satay from one of the food stalls and it was delicious.
Walking around the dark paths next to the enclosures is fun. Overall, we enjoyed the visit."
,,Roar of the Lion,4.0,,"We went to the zoo after lunch and then headed to the Night Safari in the evening. We ate dinner at Bongo Burgers (terrible food!) and watched the fire performance (not great). When the Night Safari opened we did the walking tour. The highlights were the fishing cat, the leopard making coughing sounds (a leopards roar sounds like a raspy cough), the male lion roaring, and the fruit bats. We rode the tram (very lame). We were done by 9 pm."
,,Hard to see anything,3.0,,"Reaching the attraction was difficult due to bad transfer arrangements. Possibly not their fault, but, on arrival there was a crush of people, long queue lines and when on the train much of the sights were too dark to spot wildlife and impossible to photograph since flash is forbidden. Food and drink costs at th venue were outrageous. We were disappointed. The return bus did not show."
,,night safari,4.0,,"We did the night safari and really enjoyed it got to see animals moving about and interacting instead of just sleeping tour guide on the train that takes you around very informative, also had plenty of time walking around the various areas looking at the animals on our own.We also enjoyed a great buffet there on a group tour"
,,Different experience,4.0,,"My wife and I went to the night Safari, as we heard that it was something very interesting thing to do in Singapore. The experience is one of a kind, with the chance to get up close and personal to the animals in the middle of the jungle at night. The varierty of animals are impressive, although, at times, you do still get the feeling that they are kept in small areas, like in any zoo. Overall, the experience is worth going to and this is not your typical zoo, so I would definitely recommend it...."
,,Really good attraction,4.0,,"if your bored in Singapore at night or need to do something after the sun goes down, this is the place for you. Your first entertained by some fire tricksters, then get there early so you can be on the trams first

You need a good 2 hours minimum to see all the areas, and definitely get off the stops to see the other animals and the new Caves exhibit too. Bring proper night-time photography if you can otherwise you'll have no memories of the place. And line up early for the Creatures of the Night Show, its funny and informative but can be really crowded"
,,Surprisingly Good,5.0,,"On a drizzly Tuesday night I went to night safari with my wife and a friend. We arrived a little before 9 pm and quickly got in and began the walking tour. There were a few other groups of people around, mostly families or quiet couples.

In general you get much closer to animals than in a traditional zoo. We spotted about 80 or 90% of them, and I feel ok missing a few (it's a good sign that their cages aren't so small that they have no place else to go but right in front of you).

In about 60 or 90 minutes of slow-paced walking we saw porcupines, slow loris, mousedeer, civet cats, otters, binturongs, and others I'm surely forgetting. The flying squirrels, fruit bats, and flying foxes were highlights for me - maybe because they weren't expected to be highlights.

After that we got on the tram and rode it for maybe 45 minutes or so, seeing a different set of animals - mostly larger ones (lions, elephants, giraffes) with a guide that was charming and pleasant. There was no line, though it was after 10 pm so we may have been the last group.

Based on other experiences compared to ours, I would recommend going on a weekday evening, and don't worry about a little rain, just bring an umbrella. Don't expect to be able to take pictures - it's night and you shouldn't use flash. And we didn't go to any of the shows or feeding events and still thought it was worth it. Not something I'm going to do repeatedly, but it's a good way to see animals - mostly ones from the region - that' you just don't get to see during the daytime."
,,"Much hyped, lacks content",3.0,,"Went there with lots of expectations. Turned out to be quite a dampner. ""Creatures of the night"" show had very little stuff and definitely not worth the effort, wait and time. The presentation was good but in the absence of interesting content, simply couldn't live up to expectations. There were too few animals/birds.
The tram ride was also just about okay. The way animals were made to sit close to the tram route, didn't look natural.
The walking trail was better, but after the long queues at the above, you aren't left with much time or energy.
Isn't bad overall, but definitely much over hyped."
,,Go it alone!,4.0,,"We booked a 'tour' with City-Discovery in Singapore and we shouldn't have bothered. Read reviews regarding taxi wait times to get back which is why we chose the tour, however when we arrived we found there are 2 shuttle services offering rides back to the city for hotel drop off for $5-7 SGD.
There are constant shuttles to the Zoo from hotels, or you can get a cab.
Tour itself was useless, basically extended our trip there from 30mins to 90mins, included a dinner that (as a pregnant woman) I couldn't eat and would have extended our stay an hour beyond what was needed.
Definitely try to go on a week night (Mon-Wed) so its quieter, we chose a Monday night and were faced with zero queues. Eat an early dinner before you go and then maybe grab a snack when you are there?
The experience itself is one of a kind, animals seemed much more relaxed at night and you get pretty up close with them! Definitely work making time to see if you visit Singapore!"
,,Night safari - AWESOME,5.0,,I don't consider myself a zoo person. But this was an amazing experience. And they have so much entertainment - fire dancers and performers!
,,Not worth it,1.0,,"I found the Night Safari most overrated. It's overcrowded, takes a whole lot of time to queue up for the tram. Once you're on the safari, the whole experience feels so artificial. The animals are not natural and it feels like a staged performance. I almost thought some of the animals were drugged since they just sat in one place in a stupor. A lady next to me on the tram asked if they were made of wax! The creatures of the night show is ok but it feels like you're in a circus, rather than on a Safari. If you have something better to do, please avoid spending your time and money on the Night Safari."
,,The Night Tour,4.0,,"It was very well done, and very popular. There was little or no lighting, so you need a special camera/setting as the photos don't come out."
,,It is dark at night....,4.0,,"I went on what turned out to be a busy Saturday night. The queues to get in before the gates opened were impressive, but why join them? There was a great fire eating show in the eating/shopping area outside the park to watch rather than queue. The food offerings were typical attraction fare, expensive and mediocre, my advice is to eat before arriving or bring your own. Once inside, the queue for the tram ride was long but fairly fast moving. The ride itself is probably the best way to see most of the animals. But as the name suggests, it is at night and thus dark! Some of the animals are thus hard to see. And taking photos without flash takes skill and good equipment - or you can just ignore the rules and flash away. Other than the tram ride there are many paths leading around the park past animal enclosures and themed trails. And a overly theatrical animal show a bit too staged for my liking but hugely popular. Walking around in the dark with large animal noises in the distance certainly was a different experience, but really if you want to see animals, daylight is better."
,,Fun evening activity,4.0,,"We arrived about an hour early to get tickets and some food which was nice and relaxed. It wasn't too busy at this point and we were able to get in line for the tram without much of a queue. The tram ride was nice and we saw a good variety of animals.
It was really nice then to be able to go on the walks around the park after the ride. We didn't make the show as we were in the middle of walking around so decided to continue on our walk rather than rush to the other side to see the show.
The only problem we had was with the parking. Not having an Autopass card with a chip in it we were unable to get into the parking so we tried to use the intercom which wouldn't work. After trying 2 different barriers we decided to seek help and were told to try a different intercom. Eventually, after backing out of many lanes (luckily it wasn't busy at this point and there was no one behind me) we finally found an intercom that worked and the barrier was opened for us."
,,In the Wild,4.0,,"Weather permitting, I would suggest walking the trails is a far better way to view the animals and get better photo shots. Certainly take the tram ride but don't miss out on the walks! Need a quality camera to get those low light shots as flash not allowed.

Cab fare around $30, but we took the $5 a head bus back to the city. Limited stops but will get you close to most hotels."
,,"I went, still trying to decide if I enjoyed it",3.0,,"This was rated the top attraction in Singapore by Lonely Planet, so we decided to go even though the whole experience (with transport) was over $40, which seems like a lot considering. And it is overpriced as that gets you to the site, a 40 minute tram ride and access to more trails and a few shows. Our tram ride was utterly ruined by a group of tourists who didn't speak English and couldn't obey the no flash rules or stay quiet. It was maddening, as we could barely hear the commentary and the driver kept stopping to reprimand them. Anyway it was interesting to see the animals and would have been enjoyable with a more respectful group. We ate Indian food at the park and to my surprise, it was rather well done. The zoos back home have horrid food, so this was a very pleasant surprise. The fire show was kind of disappointing and I felt exploitative watching it."
,,No Flash,4.0,,"it was very nice experience to see all the animals very close to you , few recommendations for this attraction , go 1 hour early to their opining , because its really crowded , Also don't use the camera's flash , the animals will get upset ."
,,A night I'll never forget,5.0,,"Despite the very long queues, everything here was worth it. And I can understand the long queues. This place is awesome. Starting off with an amazing fire eating show with a lovely hot burger to enjoy, followed by beautiful tram safaris and walking safaris in the 100 acre ""zoo"" where the animals are much more active than in a normal zoo. Absolutely mind blowing."
,,"Wildlife, shows, warmth and food!! So good",4.0,,"We VIsited the night safari zoo while on a 4 day stopover in Singapore on our way back from Vietnam. It was great to have a beautifully cooked hamburger and chips, real proper food, and sit down to watch a fire show, before looking around - After this we started our walk then had to hurry to the creatures of the night show. This was a show in the purpose built collesium thing where they bought out the animals, some to do a variety of tricks, some just to have a closer look, things like otters, wolves etc coming to thrill the crowd and audience interaction - Well worth a look if you get the chance.

My advice is to also take the shuttle tram, as this is a more relaxing way to see all animals, and on a different route - doing this really mae the night"
,,NOT ! worth your time,3.0,,"First off, I ordered my ticket in advance before I even arrived Singapore in order to GET IN THE NIGHT SAFARI FASTER. However, once I got there, I spent MORE THAN HALF of my time JUST LINING UP to get on a tram that only takes 30 minutes. I payed 47 Singapore dollars to, well, line up. Lining up for one and a half hour just for going into a 30 minute ride is just NOT WORTH IT. You're better off enjoying your half an hour on Orchard Rd. or something. Their system is very messed up, the number of people seems to be uncontrollable. If you hate crowds, this wouldn't be the place for you. As for the actual tram ride, as I said before, takes about 30 minutes (actually calculated with my iPhone), and the animals are barely visible. To my knowledge, some of these animals aren't even ""NIGHT"" animals, or animals that only take action at night. Like lions, tigers, elephants and hippos? I'm pretty sure you can see those guys in the day time. HOWEVER, the guide was amazing, he made the whole atmosphere pumped up and got all of the passengers excited. I wouldn't recommend the Night Safari if you have a lot of jumpy kids. However, if you don't mind standing in line for more than an hour just for a half an hour trip, then it'll be a great trip. The thing is, I wouldn't go again. And I will not recommend it to anyone. It is, however, a great experience - it teaches kids the value of patience."
,,Over rated,3.0,,Very expensive for what it is. Tram ride was underwhelming with animals loitering under very dim lighting and fairly apparent that they were forced to stay in full view of the tram by barriers not visible to us. The animal show was entertaining as was the fire breathing show. I wouldn't do it again.
,,Ok.....,2.0,,"I booked a tour through luxury tours, as recommended at my hotel.

For $50, this included pickup from hotel to night safari, entry and return to hotel. Pick up was 17:30, return was about 22:15.

The guide for our transport, Ben, was really friendly and informative. The transport was easy and hassle free.

We arrived at the night safari 18:45... took the first tram for the night safari at 19:15, then the night creatures show at 20:30 then the fire show at 21:00. Departure was 21:30.

This particular tour left enough time for all of the above, and not much else. For me, the time allowed was ok, but for those of you who may wish to do the walks and see the animals up close, you will need more time....so if your going via a tour like I did but want to find your own way back instead, there is the option of taking an express bus back to town for $5.

If you're looking to eat there, expect to pay big dollars. A bongo burger, chips and a coke cost just over $18. The food was not very nice, and the staff were slow and somewhat rude.

The night safari was ok...exhibits were too dimly lit to be able to see much of the animals, and there was not much that really blew my hair back. The tram seats are hard plastic and quite uncomfortable after a while. You may also want to bring some insect repellent.

The night creature show was also ok....again, the animals were difficult to see in the dark....and there was nothing really spectacular about it....except for the charming Zac who hosted the show... he was quite funny and really engaged the crowd.

Im glad I went for something to do, but I dont consider it a must see."
,,"Quite simply, one of the most interesting zoos in the world",5.0,,Have been to zoos in many countries and can honestly say this is one of the best and most unique. It would be criminal to visit Singapore and not come here!!!
,,Nicely created,4.0,,"We could visit on a weekday so not heavily crowded.

The show at the amphitheatre was innovative.

Took the one hour ride thro the man made forest.well informed very well set but looks a little like a setting,all animals focused in lights.children will like it.as a family of adults ,it was just ok,as we had opportunity to trek in Indian forest at night with a guide"
,,NIght Safari - something not seen anywhere else!,5.0,,We arrived early (6pm) and had a drink whilst waiting for the fire-eating display. Small shops which really catered for children. Got on small train (no talking/flash photography) with guide who gave an excellent commentary describing all the animals. It was enchanting. The animals were shown in as near their natural habitat as possible. We had to stop on occasions as deer or tapirs crossed in front of us - totally unconcerned! Saw tigers and other dangerous animals but no obvious signs of being able to reach us. The tour takes about 50 mins and is then followed by a show in the Amphitheatre. Animal lovers (and I am one) need not worry about animals being taught tricks for the crowd. We enjoyed it immensely!
,,Get a different view on wildlife,4.0,,"Zoo are all look alike... except this one.
Visiting at night gives a different view on animal behavior and also gives an opportunity to see different animals...

the different trails give you the opportunity to choose the animals you want to see.

The only limit of the zoo is its popularity.... quite a lot of people...
Try to arrive early to get the tram first and later go around at your own pace...
and also try to be on time for Tiger feeding... amazing show..."
,,Zoo night safari,4.0,,Loved the trolley trip in the dark to see the animals but did not like the rush so that there was insufficient time to walk along some of the tracks.
,,"Night Safari is a ""MUST DO""",5.0,,"The Zoo is a very large, open and slick attraction.
Not cheap. Admission and Night Safari was around US$25 for adults.

However, once in, the amazement begins. There was a night predator show in the amphitheatre. Most creatures were not killers, but were smaller animals like otters, or herbivores, or snakes, but all were untethered and well trained. It was most interesting to observe them at night and active. The excellent MC made the whole show relevant to us. He and the show get an ""A"". This may sound like it was dorky, but it was most definitely NOT. Good show and well worth seeing.

But...This was just the warm up. The real Night Safari is a tram ride through the extremely large zoo, where the animals were not behind bars. There were NO cages, and no concrete sterile floors. The animals, some very large and definitely dangerous, were separated from us by topography alone. Lion, elephants, tigers, cape buffalo, and so many others that I truly lost count. We saw one large male lion roaring as we passed. For real.

There were also a number of places where you could leave the tram and follow (carefully) a path through the ""jungle"" and view some animals more closely (although I thought that we were quite close enough, thank you.)

I have never seen a zoo like this where the animals appeared to be free, although we knew that they were not. (Good thing). And viewing them at night we could see them active rather than just sleeping.

The Night Safari is a MUST DO. If you have kids, they will surely be impressed even more than we were.

One word summary.....""GO""."
,,Night safari,5.0,,"Great experience. Get the MRT to local bus station and bus drops you off and picks you up from the entrance. Thought it was a little over priced, but still worth doing. Saw elephants, hippos, zebra, giraffes, tigers, cheetahs, lions and lots more in close proximity and in natural habitats, no nasty cages!"
,,Singapore night safari,5.0,,"We chose to have the personal tour after reading comments on trip advisor. Although this was expensive it was money well spent.
We had dinner first (included in the price). The food was good with plenty of choice. I would recommend going earlier than stated on ticket to enable you to enjoy the experience and the time to enjoy your food.
We had an amazing guide who was very knowledgeable and very keen to please, with this trip you get your own guide and there is only your group in the buggy. The guide stopped at every enclosure for as long as we needed. We did not feel as though we were being rushed at any point.
We were also given the opportunity of feeding the elephants.
The only downside was that our photos did not come out as you cannot use the flash as it upsets the animals."
,,Do not visit with young children after a full day at the zoo!,1.0,,"For us, travelling with two children aged 6, it was a mistake to go to the Night Safari right after a whole day spent at the zoo. It became apparent that the Night Safari is HEAPS more popular than the Zoo and there was lots of people everywhere and queues. It's also not clear that there are more restaurants at the night safari, which was a shame as we queued a long time for sub-standard expensive Bongo burgers, only to discover when leaving that there were a variety of restaurants we could have dined at.
Admittedly whilst we were queuing they brought out the Fire eating stunt display people which kept the children entertained but I saw nothing as I was queuing...Again, it was a long queue to get on the Night Safari tram (we waited 40 minutes), and once on, the 'guide' spent a lot of time telling off someone in the back for using a flash. The couple sitting behind us kept up an endless stream of patter in Dutch despite the guide asking everyone to be quiet. After the bright & colourfulness of the zoo, sitting in near-darkness, trying to see animals was really disappointing (most of them we had seen in the zoo anyway). The lion was the best part but that lasted 45 seconds before the tram went around the corner. I had read there is a stop to get off, half way where you can walk around but our tram did not permit any stops, so it was a quick look here, one minute, move along, a quick look there one minute, move along. The only thing I was grateful for after queuing so long was the chance to sit down for awhile.... Upon getting off the tram, we headed to the 8:30pm show but was told at 8:10pm that it was already full and we would have to wait for the 9:30pm show. We were all tired and irritable and left. I would not recommend the Night Safari at all."
,,Great and different experience,4.0,,"Starts at 7 in the evening only
Don't miss the Tambola or the Fire show at the entrance
Take a tram ride but also do the walking through the jungle
There are four walking trails in total
The feeding session of the Tiger is at 8.30 pm. Dont miss it.
Over all a different experience"
,,Great for all ages!,5.0,,We liked this so much that we have taken a full year multi entry pass for the whole family. This is good for any age. Being so close to so many wonderful animals is a rare treat. I expect every person on this earth would enjoy aspects of this great collection of nature.
,,"Nice experience, but a little overrated",4.0,,"The experience was fairly good for young children. They get to see various creatures during the night in a zoo like vs safari setting. Creatures of the night show does hold your attention. Make sure to go here first then perhaps ride the tram. This way you avoid waiting in either line. Paid 92SGD for two adults and a child. Probably would not return, but my 8yr old son enjoyed it."
,,Good for kids,3.0,,"This attraction is great for kids, our family is made up of 2 teenagers and 2 younger kids. The younger kids absolutely loved it, the novelty of seeing animals in the dark was great for them. I couldn't really see but it looked like the animals had a decent amount of space to roam around in. If you're an animal lover be aware that they don't turn out the lights until 2am which is quite sad for the animals. We visited here in 2011."
,,"Lovely, cooler way to see the area's creatures",4.0,,"Singapore is mostly urban but has so much greenery and garden landscaping that it doesn't feel like a big city in many spaces. Complementing the foliage is this fascinating way to see what creatures live in the region or used to inhabit the island before growing human populations squeezed them out. Sadly, that's a theme in evidence as you view these lovey creatures. Many face extinction or severe depletion of their habitat because of human encroachment, poaching or careless agriculture practices.

We started off with the tram tour, which gives a nice overview of the area and great sightings of most animals. I was surprised how many were in view, almost as if zookeepers were hiding in the brush, herding the animals into the center of each scene for easy viewing just before each tram drove by. After that we saw the night creatures stage show, which is cute but geared toward entertaining children. Then we hiked a few trails around the area where a tiger is fed at a certain hour (not very exciting, but seeing these huge cats move provokes a sense of awe). You can spend all evening wandering the trails, viewing animals and enjoying the dimly lit scenery.

Overall, this is a beautifully managed and organized zoo with a unique way of seeing lovely creatures in their habitats, more active in the cooler evening than in the heat of the day, albeit harder to see in detail because of the darkness. No flash photography--you will not get any decent photos of animals unless you use a tripod and photograph an animal standing still.

Great option for visitors looking for something less cosmopolitan than shopping or skyline viewing from a downtown perch. Not very expensive. Decent places to eat or snack (Ben and Jerry's!). Be mindful of heavy traffic from the city center going to the zoo during the week, if you want to arrive around 7 pm. That is peak rush hour."
,,Wasn't as good as expected,3.0,,"I thought that this would be better than it actually was.

It was hard to spot the animals in the dark and I found that overall the walk around the zoo was a little disappointing. Also on the negatives were the distance from Singapore, the cost of the tickets and the price of food and drinks.

The tram ride through the zoo was good and informative and enjoyable but, overall, not worth the time and expense of getting there."
,,Very popular for a reason - night magic,4.0,,"Once the sun sets, many of the zoo animals come out and the safari trams start making the rounds of their pens. There's just enough lighting for people to see the animals, but not so much that it disturbs the animals. In addition to the tram, there are several footpaths that are open at night - be sure to get off at the stop midway on the tram ride and do those paths before getting back on the tram. On one of the paths, you can go into the flying squirrel enclosure where small, square flying carpets glide over your head, land at your feet, turn back into squirrels, and scamper up trees to repeat the magical stunt."
,,Night Zoo,5.0,,We did the night visit & it was lovely. A wonderful place with lots to see & do. An enjoyable visit.
,,Night Safari - A Must See,5.0,,"This cannot be called a zoo. Experiencing the life of animals in their nocturnal state was one of the best experiences of my life. The park is clean, friendly and safe. Wide range of animals can be seen roaming around. Taking pictures while travelling in the trolley is a hard task due to the dim light and the use of flash will disturb the animals. The Creatures of the Night show was entertaining and there are other leisure activities at the entrance as well."
,,Singapre Zoo Night Safari,5.0,,"An experience never to be forgotten.
We caught the coach from The Hilton Hotel in Scotts Road out to the Zoo and home again. Very convenient way to get there.
The commentary on the ""Safari Train"" was excellent.
We saw a lot of rare animals and to see them in their natural surrounds was perfect.
The food and entertainment is also of a very high standard.
We could easily go there again"
,,A tourist must do but not overwhelmingly great,3.0,,"We booked online at Viator. We had bus pick up at hotel 6:15pm, arrived at 7:30pm & was told to be back at zoo pickup point at 9:30pm. Walked through main entrance to find open courtyard with bars, eateries, gift shops, food vendors... If you have your ticket already no need to see ticket booth at very entrance just make your way up a little through the courtyard to hand ticket to get thru turn style. You have 3 events at the night safari to get thru on the night: tram ride, creatures of the night show & fire eating stunt display. There are various times for all 3 events but we did ours in this order: straight to Tram a Ride. Do this first as the line gets very busy & waiting in hot crowds is not pleasant. No flash photography allowed on tram ride, sit back, listen to tram commentary & watch the animals. Some animals you see clearly, others not so much. There is 1 opportunity during tram ride to get off at a stop point & take a walk through the trails at night. The next tram will pick you up at the drop off point when you've finished walking. After tram ride, proceed to the Creatures of the night show in sloped seating outside auditorium. Watch animals as they do their trained tricks & walk out. Then afterwards proceed back to main courtyard to catch the fire eating & blowing stunts. Might have time to get quick bite to eat or something from gift shop then outside to meet driver. I love animals & was looking forward to this but left a little disappointed. Singapore Night Safari was a tick off the list experience rather than an unforgettable time. I would recommend tourists go but don't expect too much."
,,Not what it used to be.,3.0,,"I went not long after it opened in the early 1990's and was awestruck so was keen to take my husband and children, however I left feeling rather disappointed.

Previously a lot more of the animals roamed free and come up close and personal. It seemed very rushed, you couldn't pick up a tram part way though and continue around, even if you had waled the first half.

There were some animals there that weren't in the Zoo, but most were just a repeat of what we saw in the zoo but harder to see.

The food outlets were very expensive and limited in cuisine, not that we went for the food, but we did go after a full day at the Zoo so we had to eat.

Wouldn't be in a hurry to go again or to recommend it to others."
,,Overrated. Not required at all. Give it a miss.,1.0,,"The night safari, although structured as a nocturnal life view of the animals in the region, is anything but. Huge groups, herded into trains/trams and driven through the night with a guide talking through a PA system. The visuals are not clear. The lighting (understandably) in the animal pen areas is very very minimal to keep them from being distracted. Whats the point really ?

The best way to do the night safari would be to have a pre-safari dissemination of details, a walk through in clear glass tunnel/channel which is sound proofed (for the idiots who do not understand the meaning of the instruction ""please keep quiet"") and one-way view glass (for the idiots who do not understand the meaning of the instruction ""do not use flash"") and related interventions that will help us really enjoy the concept of a night safari."
,,a night at the zoo,5.0,,We went on a tour which included dinner at the zoo. The meal was very good with a good variety of dishes. The actual tour around the zoo was fantastic it was very easy walking even though we were given the impression that the ground could be a bit uneven. For that reason some people on the tour only did the train ride which was a shame as they missed a wonderful experience. My only complaint was that the time allotted was much too short we missed one whole section through lack of time.
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Just ok.. Not a good value for the money you put out. Its too dark to get a really good look at the animals.. I know, I know -its a night safari. It just wasn't what Ii expected after all the rave reviews.Definitely eat before you get to the park. The service at Bongo burgers was so slow.. Very expensive for terrible tasting food.. Did not start off the night in a good way."
,,Quiet,3.0,,"Great experience overall, but would have preferred longer stops on the safari trip. The bars/food/shops before and after the safari all complimented the evening, but we went for the animals and that felt a little rushed. Perhaps walking the safari is a better option."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,THE most exciting experience on my trip! We had dinner at Bongo Burgers there (high priced stadium food) and watched the fire breathing show at the entrance before walking the 4 trails and then getting on the tram. I have never been so close to creatures (inches to just 2 feet away in some exhibits) or been in the same confined space with them to experience in their natural habitat! A flying squirrel flew just a few feet from our heads! The Bat Mangove was awesome and the creatures were very active and flying all around us! There are 4 walking trails and a tram path. You see things on the tram ride that you cannot get to by walking and vise versa so get there around 6:30-7 and do both- expect to spend all night there. We left at 10:30 but only because the creatures of the night show was canceled due to rain. The lion feeding was less than exciting. They just threw meat up to them with an electric fence making noise to prevent them from running toward the staff tossing the meat. Well lit but no flash allowed due to the camera flashes ability to blind and scare the nocturnal animals- so pictures are difficult to get. SO MUCH FUN!
,,Night Safari,5.0,,Great fun! Loved seeing the animals at night followed by the fire dancing and a bite to eat! Couldn't be tempted to try the fish that nibble at your feet though!
,,"Good combo with afternoon zoo trip, super fun if not crowded",4.0,,"Hope my experience help others plan their trip better and get the most out of it.

1. We scheduled our afternoon zoo trip + night safari on a weekday. Since it is not crowded, it took us only 3 hours to visit all the animals and attractions, including the tram ride, animal feeding, ice cream breaks and shopping at souvenir shops.
2. Transferred to Night Safari and had early dinner at the Ulu Ulu safari restaurant. Walked to the entrance just a few minutes before opening and first to queue for the tram.
3. Boarded the first tram and seated on the side, good spot to hear the commentary loud and clear, and see the animals up close. Some of the animals are curious enough to approach the tram which is quite exciting. It is also good to sit on the middle wagon (3 wagons per tram), they usually have the best view when the tram stops in front of the animals.
4. Nobody is getting off the tram at the halfway stop, so we completed the tour then spent the next hour exploring the walking trails. Don't miss the otters, they are really cute!
5. On our way out, we had a chance to watch the fire show at the courtyard. Not crowded since most visitors started the trip with the fire show before entering the night safari. We had time to buy souvenirs then headed to the coach bay for our 9:30pm pick up.

Avoid weekends and holidays for a convenient and more enjoyable trip. The tram ride is the highlight so try to get the best seat. The commentary is also very good and they spot the animals for you. Insect repellent will help keep mosquitoes away. Don't attempt flash photography, they are very serious about this rule and I have witnessed embarrassing moments for stubborn visitors.

It's a different experience to explore trails in the dark and feel that the animals are watching you and not the other way around. Glad we made this trip."
,,Only 4 stars because,4.0,,"Only 4 stars because we saw the zoo in the morning. but if my son to review it, he would give it 5 stars. he thoroughly enjoyed it because he kept thinking that wild animals can jump into the tramp. they dont. :-)"
,,Don't go during school holidays or Weekends,3.0,,"Really disappointed with this Zoo. I was so looking forward to seeing animals at night and booked through a tour company, so had to fit into their time frames. It so so busy that we lined up for over an hour for the tram which then left no time to do any of the walking trails and still be back at the meeting place to get tour bus Back to our hotel. So we only got to see a very small part of the zoo during the tram ride which took around 20 minutes, and the rest spent lining up in the Singapore heat. Maybe if we went mid week we may have had a different experience."
,,Singapore Night Safaris - overrated,3.0,,"We were looking forward to seeing the animals at night, it had the atmosphere and the animals were there but subdued and it just didn't click with us. Lots of people surged into the Zoo at opening time but as time wore on, you really didn't notice the crowds as there were disbursed throughout the park.

The creatures of the night show was disappointing but would have been interesting for children."
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,"There was a welcome fire show dance in the courtyard, which is memorable. It's a good intro to what is coming up. There was a long queue past the ticketed entrance, to board the safari trams. It was very exciting to travel inside a forest at dark. After the tour, we went for the creatures of the night show. Very well staged show. And then we went for the walking tour, on our own. We met other people on and off, but for most it seemed that we were alone, walking throughout the forest. It felt very adventurous. There are guides and staff stationed throughout to help you. Very safe and very exciting. The kids loved it."
,,By far the best thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,"I LOVED this. So full of excitement and fun. Be prepared to wait in line quite some time but it will be so worth it. The craziest thing we saw here were the giant indian flying squirrels. There is a big cage you enter where they roam free and fly very close to you. It's like seeing a full grown dog fly! Crazy. The same goes for the bat cage. The bats were the size of my legs and they just fly around you, we were scared of running into one but the excitement just made it better. The tour on the tram that you go on first is a lot of fun with the guides telling you all of the info in a very fun way. Be prepared to be amazed."
,,Glimpse of wildlife at night,5.0,,"Night safari is a very innovative idea. Inspite of the numerous wild life sanctuaries and zoos we have in India, we don't get to see animals beyond dusk. the night safari gives us a chance to see animals after sunset, though they are in confined territories. the short trails allowed within different areas of the park at night is a very good idea apart from the tram ride. the walks definitely give a more closer experience to the animal night life. the show about the nocturnal animals is a strongly recommended watch. it sheds light on many of the smaller nocturnal animals that we did not know so far. older kids 8-10 yr olds will definitely enjoy this new experience!"
,,Atmosphere Aplenty at the Night Safari,5.0,,"Having spent a fantastic day at the Singapore Zoo we headed straight for the Night Safari after a cold drink in the forecourt area. First we were off to the night wildlife show, which was well staged, albeit a bit noisy from the PA system - but great fun and interesting. Then it was a rush to the Trams for the motor tour of the Park. This suited us well as we had worn ourselves out walking the Zoo throughout the day. The queues for the Trams were the longest I have seen anywhere - but in true Singaporean fashion were handled with ease by the Night Safari Park Staff and we were soon on our way. This is a great way to see the Park, good commentary, comfy seat and plenty of stops to see various animals. Very happy to recommend this attraction to others !"
,,Must do with Kids,5.0,,"Beautiful setting and landscaping and facilities top notch. Very interesting at night as one feels the animals are watching you instead of you watching the animals. It does make for a late evening and by the time you have seen everything ( including the show ), the kids are all but done. The fire show is memorable and the experience definitely worthwhile. Getting there and back a bit of an effort and if you miss the last bus be prepared for a taxi fare."
,,A bad night?,3.0,,"I hesitate to give a review of the Night Safari because I don't think my experience was the norm. We started out with a late start on the SAEx bus (great price, but would definitely recommend getting to the zoo as early as possible). We didn't get there until past 7:30p and, although the zoo didn't close until midnight, we were told that the last SAEx bus would leave at 11p and we needed to be back by 10:30p. This made for a very rushed and stressful experience as we wanted to be sure we didn't miss the bus back and have to pay 10x more for our return trip.

As we were there the weekend of Singapore's birthday, the Night Safari was crazy crowded. We had to wait about 1.5 hours to get on the tram, which only added to our stress about not missing the bus. After riding on the tram for a bit, they informed us that we could get off-and-on, so we decided to get off the tram and walk that area before getting back on the tram to go to a different area. It was honestly so crowded, it was hard to see some of the animal displays and people were running around. It really wasn't that enjoyable and we didn't even get to go to any other area or see any shows. And, for me, I didn't think about how my deteriorating night vision might not be a good match for this attraction. It was just too dark for me to see anything in detail even when I was able to get close to a display.

My advice -- don't go on a holiday weekend!"
,,Expensive and not photographer friendly,2.0,,"I'm a photographer, and my main purpose to this park is to explore the animals here. It is a bit of a disappointment for me due to the following:
1) Short opening hours. I expect the park to open at 6pm to midnight, there are so much to see but not enough time!
2) Not all exhibits are accessible by walking. About 50% of the park exhibits are only available through the trams. This is unacceptable and it gives me the impression everything is in a rush. If the Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park can do it, why not the Night Safari?
3) Dimly lit exhibits. The park management said this is to prevent making the animals stressed out and prevent them from being aggressive. Definitely an extra light wouldn't kill the animals!
4) Expensive admission fees. For S$35, you are not getting the most of it. For the 3 reasons I state above.
5) Glasses are reflective. I know glasses are reflective, but surely they can add a layer of anti-glare filter to make it better for viewing pleasure.
Tips for visiting:
1) Visit only in the months of May, July and August. They are the summer months and the sun sets a bit later.
2) Bring along lots of water. You are going to spend a lot of hours here. You need to refresh yourself, and mind you the refreshments on sale here is expensive!
3) Bring insect repellent. Just in case you will need this.
4) Avoid the school holidays and public holidays and weekends if possible. So you avoid the crowds, and you don't need to wait that long for a tram ride.
5) Enjoy the walking trails first, take the tram later. Unless you are on a packaged tour, please do not take the tram first, so that you don't have to waste valuable time just on waiting!"
,,Nature Up Close,5.0,,"After a day at the Zoo, we got dinner at the food court outside and then headed into the Night Safari as soon as it opened. This worked to our advantage as we were able to catch seats at the night wildlife show, which was entertaining and informative. By the time we got out, there was a long line for the trams, so we went ahead and took the walking trails. These were quiet and not crowded, so it was a very pleasant walk.
To end, we took the tram ride, which got us within arm's reach of animals, including a baby tapir. For the best tram experience, sit on outside"
,,"Night zoo, great fun with a 4 year old, a touch late for the really young ones",4.0,,"Great night out at the Night Safari.
First thing - we went to the show, good thing to start off with.
Then ran back to the tram ride - the tram ride was a really great, fast way to see the zoo with a running commentary.
I think it would have been really nice to go for a walk around, but by that time my 4 year old was definately exhausted & ready for bed! But looks like great fun for everyone else!"
,,A different view,5.0,,"Night safari is a great concept. I took the tram ride first and once this was complete, approx 30 mins, I walked the various paths. Beautifully set out. Recommend you include the Night Safari on your trip."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"We did the Night Safari at the same time as the Zoo. Makes for a long day of walking. If you are going with small children, I'd take a break between the two.
But really well laid out, and getting so close to the animals is amazing."
,,Atmospheric and inspiring,5.0,,"The night safari provided some great experiences. Expectations roused as you enter through flaming torches with rhythmic African music. The tram ride (included) introduces you to most of the animals in enclosures which are excellent for people's viewing (I hope they're equally good for the animals). It's well worth doing some of the walking trails too, as that way you see animal enclosures from a different angle, as well as a number that you don't see on the tram ride. the pride of Indian lions - 9 out of about 300 left in the world -remarkable in itself, but when they're alert and all aligned waiting for food, it's quite a sight. I visited near a full moon, and the wolves were howling - terrific.
Some of the smaller animals are great too - slow lorises and other animals that are normally drowsy in normal zoos were active and enthralling.

Allow about 3 hours - more if you want to see everything.

There are special tourist (rather than general public) buses - which get their quicker than the normal public ones. A bit more expensive, but worth it, as the zoo and n ight safari are quite a way out of town.

This is quite separate from the Singapore Zoo, athough run by the same people. Well worth visiting both."
,,Tours not what they seem,3.0,,"Be aware that the various four hour tours are not what they seem. The four hours includes pick up from your hotel and the journey to the safari. At best you'll get two hours at the safari.
The guided tram ride is outstanding, well organised with good commentary. If you are better organised than us, ensure you take advantage of the various walks on offer.
The shops are tacky and not in keeping with the high standards of Singapore."
,,Great evening for all,5.0,,"i really enjoyed this tour, the animals seemed well cared for and the habitats were fantastic very close to natural habitats. the show was fun too."
,,A very different experience,5.0,,"Although located next door to the Singapore Zoo (and soon to be joined by the River Safari), this is a different place to the zoo, with a different collection of animals on display. There are various combined-ticket options available.
There are many eating options located on-site, so it is possible to arrive in time to have a meal before seeing the animals.
We chose to ride the zoo train (twice) - it is a much longer trip than the day-zoo train, and there are places to leave the train and walk if you choose.
It is very different to see animals at ""night"" - a level of lighting that is really in-between.
We returned to the city on an express bus that cost us SGD 5 each - more expensive than public transport, but a lot faster, and cheaper than a taxi."
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,"I have heard lot of good stuff about Singapore Night Safari, nothing like a first hand experience. we first went to Singapore Zoo and then visited Nigh Safari, we were bit tiered however the tram ride was pleasant, kids had good experience. After tram ride we stayed on for a short walk around."
,,Good family evening out,4.0,,"We took our daughters here and had a nice time. We had an organised tour and our tour guide was very informative, lovely bloke called,""Brian"", he even had a sense of humour. We didn't have a wait for our tram, straight on no hassles. Tour was great and the animals where being conveniently feed close to the tram ride making the them feel so close. Bit difficult to take photos with a small camera, I noticed the larger SLR's we're getting better low light shots. The walks are good also not too up and down and if you can find the flying squirrels, there fantastic. I'm sure the big one just hangs around the entry door waiting for unsuspecting visitors, then swoosh he flys past you head, great fun and lovely to see. Time does fly so spend your time wisely. My wife tried the fish foot spa, that was worth it just for the laughs and screams. The only negative was the getting back to the hotel, Brian did his best but it just seemed very messy, on one bus off another, wait here, this just tainted the whole evening but still well worth it."
,,Something you don't see every day..,4.0,,The Night Safari was more of an educational visit as you saw animals in their natural habitats at night. The kids enjoyed it you didn't have to walk around the park if you didn't want to as there was a tram ride around. The stops were a little too short between animals as it didn't give enough time to sit back and enjoy it as much as l would have liked. The pre-entertainment was great before you walk in and the show was well organised as well. Another must do on the itinerary.
,,Overcrowded and Overpriced,1.0,,The experience of seeing animals at night in the wild seemed a great idea but in practice was very disappointing. Even though we read the advice and set off early we still found a long wait of about 45 minutes. When we finally got on a tram we found most animals were either a sleep or in the shadows. We probably would of been better seeing the animals during the day. We were frustrated that at every chance they wanted to try and sell you a photo.
,,Beware of queues if you go on an organised tour,4.0,,"The night safari is a really different experience and lots of fun, if somewhat pricey. However, if you go on an organised tour, you have limited time there and need to be aware that the queue for the tram ride can take up a substantial proportion of the overall visit time (half an hour is not unusual and can be longer).

you can get there under your own steam to stay longer.

the highlight was when the flying squirrel dived on us - really amazing to get so close to animals normally unseen in daylight.

Food is hugely overpriced, pretty bad and takes ages to be served so take your own or eat beforehand."
,,Nocturnal,5.0,,"I had a fun trip to the Night Safari Located in Mendai road, it was nice to get away from the busy city centre and shopping strips The animals are more active at night so you get to see a lot Highly recommended"
,,Great for the whole family,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our trolley tour around the Night Safari. It gave the kids a great view of animals that you have to travel halfway across the world to see, ie Africa. The presentation was very well done, though sometimes we would have liked a little longer to view.

After the trolley tour the kids stayed on for a walk around and enjoyed that as well.

Definitely worth a visit. We did River Safari in the afternoon and then moved onto the Night Safari in the early evening.

,,Night Zoo,5.0,,This is a tour not to be missed. We were lucky enough to see all of the animals on the night that we went. There is entertainment and food outside the entrance and then a train takes you round the zoo. It was very busy but well organised.
,,"Nice, but pricey for the time spent",4.0,,This is a novel thing to do. We thought the entrance fee was a lot for the park being open for only around 3 hours. The shows fill up fast and then you have to wait for the next one.
,,Nature at night,5.0,,My third visit to Night Safari. Amazing as usual. Great to see all Animals so close. Great show as well. Love the Fire breathing dances.
,,Too commercial,1.0,,"If you want to be surrounded by crowds and queue up like cattle, visit here. Expensive and far too busy, much better places to see."
,,Different way to see animals at night,4.0,,"If you want to experience the Zoo but at the same time escape the heat and humidity during the day then I would recommend the Night Safari. It's a nice and neat zoo with a variety of species for viewing. However, note that at night it can be hard to spot a lot of animals and makes moving around a little more challenging (so maybe not for babies or older people). Recommend you pre-book a taxi for pick up if you plan to stay until close as the queue for the bus and taxi rank is massive and would take you a good hour+ to hop onto transport."
,,Lovely way to spend an evening,4.0,,"Hi,

I went to the Night Safari with my wife and 5 year old daughter. It was an educative experience for her to see all the animals up close after reading about them. The best part is you don't need to walk too much here as the Tram ride takes care of your sight seeing, and you see some Anaimals which you wouldn't dream of seeing in Singapore City. It is well maintained, the hosts know all about their work which is very informative, and the trails to walk are excellent too, specially the Wallaby trail, as if your transported straight to Australia. On the whole, a fantastic evening, and I loved the experience. Buy tickets online to avoid queues."
,,Pleasant evening,3.0,,Something different to do at night. Avoid the crowds by doing the walking first and taking the trolley bus after 9pm when the queues will have dissipated. It is crowded initially but It stays open until midnight so you have plenty of time. Eat before you go it will save you money!
,,Do not miss,4.0,,"Experience something unique. Excellent guides including the drivers, who seem to take pride in their work. The trek in the dark may look intimidating, but you will have an unforgettable experience. Well maintained and good collection of wild life."
,,Safari,4.0,,The safari is quite interesting and organized. There was a fire show followed by an interesting show by a few animals. Coming from Africa I was a bit disappointed as i expected to see more animals in the jungle. It was a good outing.
