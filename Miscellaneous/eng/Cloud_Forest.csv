,,Paradise under cover,5.0,,"The architecture combined with the trees and greenery was a sight to behold. It was like another world, a world protected and apart from the city surrounding it. Precious."
,,the waterfall is Amazing,5.0,,This is one of the 2 domes found at the gardens by the bay. This dome has a amazing waterfall that is about 6 storey tall. So beautiful; must visit. The air inside smells very fresh.
,,Fantastic atmosphere,5.0,,"Water vapour in air Cool temperature and exotic plants and flowers Waterfall Interesting lighting at night, misty, out of this world feel Overlying vegetation : walk on steel walkways"
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,You have to go is all I can say! The creativity for this place is amazing. It can be quite cool in there so a long sleeve jacket/cardigan may be useful.
,,A must see,5.0,,"This was truly brilliant, take your time and enjoy. There is a lot to see and take in, from the scupltures hidden away, to the unique gardens. Some areas can get a little congested, so be patient. This is well worth a visit."
,,Air conditioned forest with man made water fall,5.0,,Air conditioned forest in the mid of the town with a 30mtr high man made water fall. can spend at least half a day over there. Singapore as a city is really great in maintaining the greenery. Loved it.
,,Sustainability,4.0,,"Awesome gardens. Pity that the shops around don’t practise the sane sustainability. So much single use plastic and straws in use at the gardens, that it seems hypocritical to preach future sustainability inside the domes"
,,WOWWW,5.0,,"whe you enter the pace and see this huge moutain of green you really feel amazed, it s fun to ride along and see all the beautifull flowers and read all the informations"
,,A green oasis in the middle of Singapore,5.0,,"Waw, this place is just amazing, if you like nature, plants, flowers, trees, there is so much to see, that it is just difficult to put it into words. Just go!"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Really loved this place. Its unique and acts as refreshment in hot and humid singapore weather. Would recommend anyone to visit within a time when you can visit the light show.
,,Visit to Garden by the Bay,4.0,,Nice to visit Cloud Forest but a family with a toddler and young kids will be having an issue with going up and down to the staircase. There are 2 lifts in this building but so crowded if you happen to travel on-peak hours and holidays and weekends as well.
,,Very Cool,5.0,,"This was probably my favorite thing we did in Singapore besides eat amazing food. We enjoyed this dome the most out of our time at Gardens by the Bay. The gardens are beautiful and well designed and it was not too crowded on a Sat early afternoon to be unenjoyable though I wouldn’t try not to go when it is very crowded. I loved the different levels to view the garden, the orchid smelling exhibit and the views outside the dome while enjoying the gardens."
,,Awesome experience but not for some,5.0,,This was a great thing to do - the cloud forest is a series of environments and experiences that are well worth visiting. If (like my wife) you have a problem with vertigo then this is a challenging environment. But if not it is a truly exceptional place to visit - both for the views of Singapore and the cloud forest itself (including stalagmites and tites).
,,Refreshing,5.0,,"All the Family walked in and Wow, Breathtaking, Refreshing. Husband ,Daughter,Son made the climb to the top."
,,Always come back.,4.0,,That's always amazing to come and show this lovely domes to visiting friends. Very great views into a refreshing rainforest. I love it that the themes in the flower dome are frequently changing.
,,Impressive experience,5.0,,I bought a combi ticket for around 20eur which provides access to both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. No need to make an advanced reservation. The cloud forest is an indoor forest including high waterfalls and looks impressive. The variation of green used in the forest amazed me as well and are beautifully presented. A trail around the forest leads via awesome skywalks to the top of the waterfall. Highly recommend attraction and worth the money when in Singapore.
,,"Must Visit Place, Expect Crowds",5.0,,"This definitely is a must visit place. The ticket you buy also allows you into the flower garden next store. Very scenic inside. We ended up coming on a weekend and it was really crowded. About a 25 minute wait to take the elevator up. It’s best to time your visit so you can see the Super Grove Trees light show at 7:30pm shortly after (maybe dinner in between).

Like most attractions, it dumps you off in the gift shop at the end. Snack bar right outside of the gift shop."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The waterfall as you enter is magnificent. The walkway from the top to bottom is beautiful with the many plants and scenery of MBS building, Singapore flyer and the super trees. Being able to stand behind the large waterfall was lovely. Worth the money."
,,"""unforgettable experience""",5.0,,fantastic structure and once in a lifetime experience.. if you are in Singapore then must visit place. Its human made masterpiece.
,,Absolutely mind boggling,5.0,,"If you ever wanted to go into a deep forest but never wanted the trouble of getting there - this is your best bet. You will have to deal with the fact that it's air conditioned and quite cold on the inside and that there are no bugs. But the amount of time and thought invested into this project is brilliant. The first time I saw something like this was in Dubai. But this just takes it up a few notches. A massive waterfall (which you can walk behind), walk 7 flights up and slowly find your way down. This place isn't great if you have fear of heights or vertigo. But otherwise, it's magnificent."
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"Many others have described what is in the Cloud Dome and I agree with the comments - it is amazing whar the architects/designers have created here. There is so much to look at and experience especially in a cool enviroment. I particularly enjoyed trying to spot the different plants in the main structure and the orchid display proved interesting especially pointing out that some species have a smell which I didn't realise.

This attraction is great for all ages and along with the flower dome I can recommend a visit for all ages."
,,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,4.0,,"We went to the cloud forest on two consecutive days- Friday night and Saturday afternoon. I personally appreciated it Friday night because of the lights, the cooler atmosphere and most esp because there were no lines and less people. Regardless, it was a beautiful place ❤️"
,,Amazing especially on a hot day.,5.0,,You must visit these gardens. You won't be disappointed. The designers have done a fantastic job in building the display and the structure itself is amazing.
,,Mesmerising Creation,5.0,,Very very creatively & artistically put together.......something different from the regular outdoor garden s ...... wooden carving z are 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻..... Have have to c it to believe the wonderful creation.... it’s worth the money spent 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
,,Incredible,4.0,,I’ve seen nothing like it before it is truely incredible. An indoor waterfall and all! A bit pricey but if it’s your sort of thing than it’s worth it
,,Mesmerizing and very informative,5.0,,It is a beautiful structure and feels like a continuation of the flower dome. It is a sight to behold and it has beautifully crafted wooden animals. There is also a small video clip where it explains the effects of global warming and encourages people to think and be green.
,,Man made jungle,5.0,,"Unique architecture with man made water falls, it educates children about urban living. Visual educational aids available to children to see how global warming can affect the humans. Fantastic effort from Government"
,,Superb Experience,5.0,,"This was our third visit (over a number of years) and remains impressive. Remember a light jacket if you feel the cold, it is lovely and cool inside. The viewing platforms and walkways give a fabulous view overlooking the high waterfall and trees. There is a lot of fascinating information around the centre and the gardens are superbly maintained."
,,Beautiful Garden Display,5.0,,"I highly recommend visiting the cloud forest in Singapore. It was a very hot and humid day, but the cloud forest was an oasis from the heat. The garden is well presented and the aerial walkways give beautiful views of the various plants."
,,Stunning Botanical Property,5.0,,Great variety of plants and definitely worth visiting. The flower enclosure next door is equally stunning.
,,Loved it,5.0,,The displays here change regularly and when we went the focus was on orchids. Beautiful and well displayed
,,A must for gardeners,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is definitely worth visiting. My expectations were not high but I was looking forward to a controlled and cooler 'climate'.The floral and garden displays are beautiful showcasing the diversity of colour and shape of plants. As you follow the path, inside the dome, there is another surprise around each corner. The signage is excellent and informative.The scented orchid area was very interesting."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,So the Cloud Forest is part of Gardens by the Bay but you pay separately so you don't have to go in but it would be silly not to. Another must see. Singapore has soo many amazing places.
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Loved seeing the waterfall from the top, 3rd largest in the world. Takes about an hour to get around. Easy to find next to the ticket office and the queues were minimal at 10.30am. You can get wet close to the waterfall at the bottom and I expect at misting times. Think it’s a bit cheaper to book on line rather than at the ticket office."
,,Misty Mountain adventure,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest. Inside a monolithic greenhouse-like glass dome is a manmade-mountain. Towering, majestic waterfalls, perfect misty conditions – can get wet if you venture too close in getting the perfect selfie! I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. Start at the top, a steel-mesh walkway leading forwards to descend; look out from glass windows of the dome – silhouetted outside are impressive Marina Bay Sands hotel, Singapore Flyer, Supertree Grove. Many exotic trees, shrubs, rare plants in one place, jet-blasts of water-vapour at intervals - misty, tropical surroundings. Too many sights to do in GBTB; we picked 2 or 3, as we only had a short stopover. Train, bus, taxi, various ways to get there. Well worth it."
,,Great,5.0,,Cloud forest and its sibling flower dome are 2 really nice (air conditioned :-)) environmets showing off on natural beauty (although in an artificial environment).
,,"Spectacular, part of the Gardens by the Bay",5.0,,This is one of the highlights of Gardens By The Bay and really not to be missed. The running water makes it a wonderful experience and well worth the entrance cost.
,,Fresh cool mist,5.0,,"The 30 meter indoor waterfall with so much greenery from top to bottom creates a surreal misty cloud forest. From the moment you walk in, the cool cascading falls and air draws you to take deep breaths which is so refreshing! The mist does get you wet all over especially when taking photos nearer to the waterfall but that’s part of the fun Take your time to admire its entire purpose and the Treetop Walk is not to be missed!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Another must do while visiting Singapore. We spent a good two to three hours here and intend to revisit.
,,Must see,5.0,,A truly amazing place to see all the plants and trees from around the world as you walk the walk ways that tower above the greenery. A very unique building that can house this exceptional collection of flora
,,A stunning experience!,5.0,,"The thought of visiting an indoor rainforest seems crazy but this was such a beautiful experience I have returned to see it a number of times.
It is a very leisurely stroll through the dome but for those people who are afraid of heights you will be walking high in the canopy but it is very safe and you have no need for concern.
The views are breathtaking. My most enjoyable visit so far has been in the evening just before the dome closes. It was dark outside with rain cascading down the outside of the dome and there was a mist of water watering the plants. It was stunning!
Definitely consider buying a ticket that gives you access to a both of the domes and the new attraction Floral Fantasy and a shuttle bus ticket in between the atractions."
,,Just Brilliant,5.0,,Don’t miss this unique experience - really is superbly designed. Easily spent over an hour here. Perfectly complements other sites in the bay.
,,Too crowded,3.0,,We were unable to walk much and take good photos Because it's simply overcrowded... Beautiful waterfall but filled with people walking ahead and behind us.. Hardly any space to move
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"This large dome within the gardens, houses a massive 35 metre manmade waterfall and mountain upon which there is a planted tropical rainforest - certainly gives a good impression of one & the spray from the waterfall aids the whole atmosphere. Worth a visit whilst in the gardens."
,,Absolutely spectacular!,5.0,,"Took our breath away the second we walked in. Absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed all of the sculpture & artwork within the garden, as well as the beautifully healthy plants, in different areas as per their geography. The walkway up the top was incredible - great views around the rest of the Gardens by the Bay & a good overall view of the lower part of the garden inside the dome. In true Singapore style, it's spectacularly clean & felt very safe as well!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I was stunned as I've entered the Cloud Forest. It's amazing how beatufily it's been done. Great atmosphere, probably milions of different plants. It's a must when visiting Singapore. Great price."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Stunningly beautiful if you are a gardener you cannot miss this it is worth the money. We spent the whole day at the marina bay gardens and visited all 3 attractions.
,,OUT-OF-THE-WORLD EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"We visited on Sunday 21st July 2019. We were just wondering the grand idea, effort and skill required to create the massive and mammoth structures, gardens, walkways etc for this Cloud Forest Complex. This is excellent and an out-of-the-world experience to be here."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,We loved the Cloud Forest so much we had to return for a second visit. The plants and the walkways through them a just amazing. And I was delighted to see 2 plants from home (Kentia Palm & Norfolk Island Pine)
,,Don’t buy from TripAdvisor!!!!,1.0,,"Your ticket won’t be accepted. You have to go to a separate hotel to redeem your tickets. Just buy in the day, unless you love walking around in this heat just to get hold of your ticket"
,,Always great,5.0,,"Not the first time I've been there, and hope it won't be the last. Great experience. Some bits of the walkway were showing a bit of wear but bearing in mind the thousands that must go through here every day it is holding up well."
,,Average,2.0,,"The fountain at the beginning was impressive and the rooftop catwalk was enjoyable, however the huge amounts of people crammed into every path taking selfies makes it hard to enjoy the experience"
,,Holy sh*t!!! 😱,5.0,,"This is a must do!
I've been dying to visit the gardens by the bay and the cloud forest lived up to all my wildest expectations.
If you have a passion for horticulture, love biodiversity or just enjoy the beauty of nature, then this is the place for you.
The waterfall upon entrance will blow your mind and I easily spent over an 1 hour 30 mins slowly walking through every inch of this work of art!!

The cloud forest was the best dome we visited of them all."
,,Amazing and lovely and cool!,5.0,,"Having visited an Ecuadorian Cloud Forest last year, we can say that this is a brilliant way to experience the uniqueness and beauty of a Cloud Forest."
,,Blown away,5.0,,"We were honestly blown away by the cloud Forest. We just presumed that you walk around the outside and that’s it but we were so wrong! You make your way all the way up, literally through the clouds. There’s so much to see here. We really enjoyed ourselves!"
,,A cool oasis on a hot sunny day,5.0,,"When we entered the Cloud FOrest, we are welcomed with a breathtaking Water Fall.
such a nice oasis on a hot sunny day...
the view inside the Cloud Forest was also awesome.
took lotssss of pics inside the Dome.
the Cloud Walk is a must-do.... plenty of things to see from up above.
Truly recommended if u have the chance to visit Garden by the Bay Spore."
,,Day n Night Visit,5.0,,"Wandered into the Cloud Forest dome not sure what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised! A recreation of a high altitude tropical rainforest with hourly misting to give the plants, and humans, that rainforest feel."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The queues can be scary, but they moved pretty quickly, and it was definitely worth the wait. The balconies provide fantastic views, and the lego display was really impressive too."
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Recommended to bring walking shoes since you'll be walking a lot, especially if you do go to the top (which you should). Also make sure you'll be ok with them possible getting slightly wet!

The walk down was a bit scary since it felt like everything was moving and I'm a bit scared of heights, but I would walk it again.

They had lots of plants but you couldn't really see much of them.

Overall, you're paying more for the experience of walking down the ramp and seeing the waterfall than anything else. It was also made popular due to the movie Crazy Rich Asians so LOTS of tourists too.."
,,Much to see but take your walking shoes and stay dry!,5.0,,"We thoroughly our second visit to the Cloud Forest. It was interesting to see how much many of the trees had developed since we had made our first visit two years ago.
This visit occurred in the middle of the afternoon on a Monday and the Cloud Forest was quite crowded. The admission price for both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are quite substantial. Fortunately we had our attraction passes as part of our Singapore Airlines Holidays stopover package and these provided us with free admission to both of these attractions.
The first thing that you come to after entering the Cloud Forest is the massive indoor waterfall. It is important to be careful where you stand to take your photographs as if you stand in the wrong spot, you will soon find yourself getting quite wet. We found it difficult to get good photos as it was relatively dark with grey clouds overhead and there were many others waiting their turn to pose in front of the waterfall.
If you wish to make the most of your visit to the Cloud Forest, there is a substantial amount of walking to be done up inclined and winding walkways. You can make it a bit easier on yourself, as we did by using the lift to access some of the walkways at the higher levels.
Whilst the Cloud Forest is certainly an amazing attraction at the Gardens by the Bay, we enjoyed the Flower Dome more simply because the displays there were more colourful."
,,Incredible blend of nature and art - temp controlled!,5.0,,"The cloud forest was an impressive feat of architecture, nature and art in a temperature controlled environment."
,,Beautiful and worth a visit,5.0,,My family and I visited the Cloud Forest as part of another tour. It is a remarkable site to behold an the fact that it is cool in the dome is a nice plus on a hot Singapore Day. The waterfalls is remarkable and the vegetation and flowers beautiful. Worth a visit.
,,Gorgeous but go early,5.0,,"Go early for good pics! A beautiful place and a wonderful concept. Worth the visit but be aware that you're unlikey to get that single, clear shot as people tend to do full on photo shoots here!"
,,A MARVEL!!!,4.0,,"I was in absolute awe that you can actually create a forest with a waterfall in a closed glass dome,absolutely a marvel!!

One can spend time here just being in amazement at the work done here and the nature that they have created in a closed guarded atmosphere which is thriving.

They have an orchid garden with fragrant orchids as well.

A must visit !!!"
,,Great,4.0,,Had a great time on our second visit here. Not much changes year on year so not sure how often we would visit.
,,Wonderul,5.0,,"This place really is magic. No matter where you look there is something picture worry. I’d definitely recommend this exhibit over the flower garden if you only have time and the budget for one. I really enjoyed our time in here. Plus, it was way cooler than the temp outside."
,,Very nice park,5.0,,I love this place so much. Singapore offering so much tourist attraction. Including this gigantic man made garden.. can wait to see other tourist attraction in singapore
,,Truly amazing place,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest and the adjacent Flower Dome really are amazing places. They have done a terrific job with the display of trees, shrubs, flowers wood carvings etc. Can easily spend a couple of hours in each place and take many wonderful places. Definitely the place to visit in Singapore. Easy to get to by taking MRT to Bayside station and there is a cheap shuttle service to the domes. make sure you visit."
,,Totally breathtaking,5.0,,"There's so much to admire from this conservatory, such as its stunning design, the orchid display, the huge indoor waterfall and to the high walkways. I found there to be a real sereneness to the attraction and this is where I spent most of my time at Gardens by the Bay. Well worth the entrance fee."
,,Amazing indoor waterfall,5.0,,Place must visit if you visit Singapore. You can have lot of nice photo by claiming different floor and angle. Advise to take the photo from top floor all the way to g floor. There have many nice restaurant who are facing right in front of the waterfall. This place suit for all age include little kids.
,,Good place for enjoying nature,5.0,,"This is a great place. It is a clever display of all sort of plants recreating a microclimate that is great to see. You can get to the top and see the waterfall from behind. Also the walking paths let you appreciate more of the plants in this mini forest.
There are some carnivorous plants along with Lego models, it is worth to see.
You can have great views and take good pictures of the city's skyline.
The collection of orchids is varied and so colourful, you can compare how they produce different smells. It is great!
You will not be disapointed"
,,It was very crowded,3.0,,So many people that you could not even walk nicely or take pictures. Not worth the price you have to pay.
,,What a surprise,5.0,,I didnt really know what to expect but the cloud forrest dome was beathtaking. As soon as you enter you have this amazing waterfall infront of you. You can walk around the walkways and escalators to get to the two platforms for views looking down from the waterfall. There other amazing displays there and of course beautiful views over Singapore. The cost to enter this dome and the flower dome was S$28 for both.
,,Dome based forest,5.0,,Great adventure to walk around this manmade tower of exotic plants with views over the bay and harbour from the treetop walkway.
,,stunning,5.0,,so incredibly clever and beautifully presented arrangements of plants and flowers. such a lovely refreshing break from the heat outside
,,Amazing to see,5.0,,"water fall is the main attraction here, rest is pretty normal. But how they have presented the idea is excellent. Avoiding the rush hours will increase the value of the experience."
,,Very expensive,2.0,,Too expensive to see a waterfall and a few flowers. Long waiting times to take the elevators. Would not recommend.
,,It tourist trap but a nice one.,4.0,,The whole garden experience is a nice day out. The cloud forest is cool with the waterfalls. The one thing that is a bit annoying is that people are taking photos everywhere all the the time.
,,A beautiful place to visit,5.0,,It is a cool and pleasant place to visit. The waterfall is amazing. I visited both the cloud forest and flower dome. It is the largest glass greenhouse in the world. I love it.
,,This is an amazing place.,5.0,,"This place is fantastic! We really enjoyed our visit to the domes. The forest dome was spectacular, both in size and the variety of plants. The orchid garden was really beautiful. The walkway around up to the roof gave a great view of the dome. We were there during the holidays so the crowd was huge. Everyone was very aware of others and made sure there were no photo bombs extras in the family photo shots."
,,Excellent - in spite of the crowds,5.0,,"Impressive and comprehensive. Not just the waterfalls and individual plants, orchids or trees but also the clear educational vocation of this wonderful site. A couple of hours of pleasure!"
,,Great idea!,5.0,,This is so well done! I was just expecting random plants but to understand the altitude of various plants was so much more interesting. A lovely cool way to spend a couple of hours in Singapore.
,,Must see tourist attraction,4.0,,Impressive structure to walk around with a Jurassic park feel to it. Plants were amazing as was the waterfall. They do close the building once a month for plant maintenance so be sure to check the website.
,,Just fantastic.,5.0,,"Don't even think about it - go. Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are works of vision, brilliantly executed. Interesting and comfortable - incredibly, these huge domes are all air conditioned."
,,Absolutely magnificent,5.0,,"Could have hours just roaming around taking it the sights, plants and water fall. Must experience for anyone going to Singapore"
,,"Too many people, really not worth it",3.0,,"It’s really just a very, very crowded greenhouse, if you want to save your time and money go to the airport’s Jewel, it’s similar and without the gigantic crowds"
,,Fascinating tallest waterfall in Asia,5.0,,"Very unique setup, all the huge trees are indoor, best part of it all, it’s air conditioning. Buy the package which will include the shuttles to both Cloud Forest & Garden by the Bay."
,,Cool!,5.0,,Amazing and cooling on a hot humid day. Combined entrance with flower dome. You go up and walk down some canopy trails. Beautiful scented orchids were also ok display!
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,"This is an especially great place for kids to enjoy, but nice for anyone to get out of the heat into the air-conditioned dome. Inside is a huge man-made waterfall and lots of paths to explore including some high above the treetops. It’s nice that it is wheelchair accessible. Kind of random with some of the things included inside like stalagmites and stalactites, but a very impressive structure and exhibit. At the gardens by the bay, your admission ticket includes the cloud forest and flower dome. We found the flower dome to be even more spectacular and less cheesy."
,,Very impressive but avoid the queue,4.0,,"Very impressive waterfall, my son loved seeing it. We didn't go up it though, because the queue was miles long."
,,Great for a relax walk with family and friends.,5.0,,"Cooling place for a small walk in and hot and humid Singapore. With man made waterfall and plants all around, really made people happy. Wheel chair accessible too"
,,Cheer for summer,5.0,,Air conditioning condition and I was quite exhausted when I got here but I was so glad that I made it. Enjoy the waterfall and the walk on the sky guys!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The best part of Gardens by the Bay. Relaxing even when full of people. Wish I could back again and again!
,,Fantastic,5.0,,A concept with an amazing result. Creating a 35 m waterfall surrounded by an incredible amount of different flowers
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,Access through the MRT at Bay Sands! A great and amazing structure. Amazing building with a great display of plants and atmosphere.
,,Quite good,4.0,,Spectacular how this has been engineered with the waterfall and walkway. Quite a bit cooler than outside the dome and some water spray but an enjoyable experience. Some excellent photo opportunities.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Part of the Marina Bay Gardens, contains a stunning waterfall which can be viewed from different levels. Containing plant species from the rainforest regions of the world."
,,Great collections of plants with good crowd management,5.0,,"We did not know what to expect and bought both the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. It turned out the Cloud Forest was a lot more interesting.
When we entered the Cloud Forest, it was crowded. It was not easy to take a good photo of the waterfall. But we walked a bit more, the different levels of walkway helped to get a better view of it. Also different kinds of plants & flowers attracted us not just walk but enjoy the exhibits. I especially liked the scented orchids exhibit. Every type of flowers has its own smell and you will be surprised. When you focus on the design & the exhibits you forget about the crowd & the heat. We finally spent almost 2 hours there, but only spent 20 minutes in the Flower Dome."
,,Breathtaking experience!,5.0,,This is one of its kind and a great place to chill in the hot and tropical Singapore weather. I have been here umpteen number of times as a guide to all the relatives and friends vising us in Singapore:D.
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"Amazing place to visit.... it’s indoor and in a controlled temperature, excellent in humid hot Singapore weather. You literally get to walk high into the forest on steel walk ways. Love the man made waterfall at the enterance.... cool me down. I loved the smell of different Orchards!!! Didn’t know it existed. My mum would love this place!!!"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Loved the entire experience here. Simply beautiful. Will definitely recommend my friends and family here!
,,Lovely place to wander.,4.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed wandering through the Cloud Forest. The amount of work to create and upkeep this area would be incredible. It was just lovely, the waterfall and so many interesting little places created by amazing plants and sculptures. We didn't get to go to the top of the waterfall as the line was too long, but thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
,,Enjoyed,4.0,,"Quite a feat pf engineering, planting & maintenance! We spent a lovely hour or so meandering through this enclosure."
,,Sherin Nafie,5.0,,"Located inside Gardens by the Bay, this dome shaped place is a must visit.As soon as u enter, u r greeted by a massive indoor waterfall with lush greenery in the background. As u walk & admire the plants, u feel u r walking through a rainforest. From the escalated walkways u enjoy breathtaking views. So much positive energy! We also visited the flower dome, which is another must see."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One of the best tourist attractions I have visited - like nothing else I've ever seen. What a great way of presenting a biological garden! The incorporation of sculptures and artworks throughout added interest, and the global warming message was also appreciated."
,,A unique experience of rainforest plants,5.0,,The journey up with the elevated walkways was fascinating and there were lots of interesting plants (and signs). I was too busy taking in all of the surroundings to notice my fear of heights!
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,The cloud forest is in a convenient location as it is in Gardens by the Bay. It contains a huge tower that you must take an elevator to explore. It has a walkway and is extremely high up. I recommend using the walkway even for people afraid of heights as the view takes your mind off the height and your fear. The walkway and tour has a beautiful waterfall and lush plants with it. It is surrounded by beautiful garden beds with amazing plants inside. It is great for kids and is the most amazing entertainment. Highly recommend.
,,Well Worth A Day,5.0,,"My wife and I only had a day between flights and this was a great choice to visit. There is way more than we had chance to see in the surrounding gardens. Great waterfall, fab plantation and very informative,,, make a day of it."
,,Waterfall is a highlight,5.0,,A beautiful place to visit. The waterfall is a feature along with the variety. Really impressive set up in every respect.
,,A visit to Cloud Forest with Family,5.0,,"Its a must visit place in Singapore. We must keep in mind the timing for fountain works ( its once is every 30 minutes). The perfect time to visit is just 45 minutes before the sun set , then you can enjoy the view during the day light and just after sun set too. its takes around one hours to enjoy every part of it"
,,Cloud Forrest is plant heaven!,5.0,,I was somewhat reluctant to spend the entry fee and line up in the line to get into this venue but wow was it worth the visit!!! From the moment you walk in and are greeted by the massive waterfall this venue is nothing but impressive!! The huge wall of plants is hard to comprehend and so so beautiful! There is a second line to get up the top to walkway that shows off the impressive glass dome glass house and meanders around the plants but again was worth the wait (we got through in about 10 minutes in the evening). This was probably my favourite attraction in Singapore and I would definitely recommend checking it out. I would say arrive earlier in the day to avoid to crowds though! Allow about an hour for the whole walk.
,,Inspiring,5.0,,From the moment you walk in your breath is taken away with an amazing waterfall. The layout and exotic plants and flowers on display are a gardeners paradise. Worth the time.
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,This was the best thing I’ve ever done in Singapore. Totally worth the visit. Amazing architecture & design of the building. A perfect backdrop to some beautiful flowers.
,,"A relaxing, cool setting to visit while in Singapore",4.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. Both the Cloud Forest AND Flower Dome offer a very relaxing, beautiful and serene setting to spend 2-3 hours and at the same time get out of the extreme heat and humidity. In fact you may want to bring a light jacket because the Cloud Forest ( that is adjacent to the Flower Dome) is very cool at all times. There are other things to do at Gardens by the Bay but these two are the highlights. You need to buy separate tickets for both locations."
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,Its beautiful and worth every penny. From the moment that you walk in you feel you are in some beautiful rain forest and the experience just continues all the way. Magic place
,,Mother Nature on show!,5.0,,"What an awesome exhibition?!
Whoever thought, funded and put together this project needs to be acknowledged at the highest level.
Undoubtedly one of the highlights of our family Singapore holidays. An incredible display of why we need to be concerned about our environment and why we need to do everything in our power to protect it.
An incredible array of plants, an amazing glasshouse, the amazing man made waterfall; where do I stop?

THIS IS A MUST SEE IN SINGAPORE!!!!!!

But it is only 30% of the Gardens by the Bay exhibit so make sure you see the rest including the outside gardens; but if you only have a short stopover, allow 1 1/2 hours for Cloud Forest alone."
,,Wonderful Engineering Design,5.0,,"Its a really wonderfull man maid seperate climate zone to grow varoius kind of flowers and Terss, One of excesslent Engineering design.. So amazing"
,,A must see,5.0,,"It was absolutely pouring outside but we hadn't realised until we reached the top of the forest. There is so much to see here, especially if you enjoy visiting gardens. A picture by the waterfall is a great addition to the photo library."
,,More than we could have imagined,5.0,,"We hadn't really researched the cloud forest before our trip and were expecting a giant greenhouse that you can stroll through.
We were shocked at the magnitude of this structure. It was breathtaking! We spent hours in here, just wandering around. There is so much to see and loads of interactive displays. It was a very informative and relaxed afternoon.
Also a lovely break from the hot weather :)"
,,Very nice,4.0,,"The cloud forest is good to visit, the flowers are nice and you can get out of the heat. I am not a flower person but I did enjoy walking around looking at the different plants from different countries"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Loved loved loved this. I was truly surprised with how much I enjoyed the Cloud Forest. Even though it was very crowded, it was so well organised that the crowds weren’t an issue. The wood carvings amongst the plants were amazing. It was a lovely cool escape too. So luscious and green and beautiful flowers and plants. More than just a garden, it really is a forest with little surprises around every corner. The educational movies and displays at the end were also extremely well done. We pre bought our tickets on Klook so no queuing. Definitely a must visit place."
,,Within the wonderful (pay to enter) Marina Gardens!,5.0,,"Have no concern about paying the entrance feenasnthis experience is wonderful! Hi speed lift to the top and amazing, spray filled views!"
,,Amazing - Cloud Forest,5.0,,"This display was so beautiful, the orchids were spectacular and the lush vegetation of the tropical plants and the waterfalls were amazing and to escape the heat and and into the cool mist was so good. Such an impressive structure and attraction."
,,"Poor fantasy, not impressed much",3.0,,"The idea itself is very good. Very nice plants. But!
1. Stalactites are prohibited to touch. Why do not put just one for touching? It really do not will damage anything. People come here to have fun, to have impressions, and not touching such things - just a torture, especially for children.
2. Very poor staff in crystal room. Only amethysts, stalactites... and that's it! Why do not make here a real mineral museum with stunning crystals, minerals, stones?
3. Why do not make a place for bathing in the water pool? For children it would be real fun, for adults as well.
4. Why do not make more bridges, caves, cozy sitting places?
etc.

Very poor fantasy. Hire me and I will do a fantastic place from that boring place."
,,Beautiful but extremely poor crowd control,1.0,,"The cloud forest was beautiful. No doubt about it. But was it worth it? 6 July 2019, There was a 30 minute queue to enter the cloud forest, and a 1 hour queue to enter the lift in the cloud forest. Crowd control was extremely inadequate. Security officials turned a blind eye to queue cutting and patrons were left to enforce the queue themselves."
,,Another amazing place to visit in singapre,5.0,,I must say its a place where you have to be in singapore. You Will see different kind of plants which you will not see in todays world. Plus this place is amazing greenery and full of peace.
,,Rain forest adventure,5.0,,the Cloud forest is one of the 2 domes in Gardens by the Bay at a cost of 28 sgd for both( You cam´t by ticket for just one dome. It look us 90 mins at e leisurely pace tto tour the dome and walk all the walks up high in rhe dome. The waterfall at the entrance is spectacular as are the scent orchids. Awesome place.
,,A refreshing experience,4.0,,"A must visit if you’re in Singapore. The waterfall is a massive artificial structure that is worth viewing from various levels. Don’t be afraid to explore the dome and check out upper levels which allow you to walk on a bridge the entire length of the dome. (Tip: visit during misting hours). Take note of the timings as well, as it closes pretty early."
,,Heaven on earth!!!,5.0,,Wow at the first sight of waterfall and continue to wow at other area of the show. We love this place so much.
,,"Very unique, but it’s cold inside",5.0,,"This really is one of the most spectacular attractions I’ve ever visited. Inside the glass and steel dome, locked away from the climate outside, is this huge mountain, with an equally huge waterfall. Go strait up the mountain and enjoy the views. However... the waterfall (and aircon) make the air very cool or even cold at the top. Take long sleeves or a light jacket. Slowly make your way back down the mountain, enjoying the plants and displays along the way. Then savour the luxury of the tropical river at the bottom. Truly wonderful!"
,,Better than you can imagine,5.0,,We went at night and it was great. Our teenage sons were reluctant visitors but they were just as enthralled as we were.
,,Forest within the CITY,5.0,,This was my 2nd time in here and it's still really cold! Haha. The structure still got me amazed especially the bridges and the falls itself. This is worth a visit!
,,Orchids everywhere,4.0,,"This was by far the best of the two domes. We did this one second and I’d recommend that order, if you do one just visit here. It is full to bursting with orchids and a great atmosphere inside!"
,,Heaven for orchid lovers!,5.0,,"Amazing structure and great collection of orchids from all over, the multi level walkways/hanging bridges is cool! Very instagrammable spot to be! The only problem is lack of resting or seating area inside, nice and cool place to escape the heat and learn more about orchids."
,,Astounding Rainforest Surrounded By Astounding Gardens,5.0,,"Just go. It's superb and, in the interior, educational too. It's not expensive. You will need about 3hours."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I have never seen anything like it. We saw it both in the day time and at night and both are just as spectacular. Views over the city were fantastic as well. A definite must.
,,WOW!! - A Must,5.0,,"A true wow! The design, set up and the display are simply outstanding.A combination of learning, exposure to nature and it's beauty. The plants, flowers and other exhibits are amazing."
,,Cloud forrest,5.0,,"See the flowers and fauna from high level platforms ( not for the faint hearted) at their best, Palms trees, flowers and lots you have never seen before, wonderful show"
,,Excellent Place,5.0,,Excellent place for visiting with friends and family. various types of plants are grown by them. and the waterfall. I love this place
,,Cloud Forest Singapore,3.0,,A well maintained attraction in singapore near Gardens by the bay. Not exactly a must visit. Quite avoidable if you are on a short visit.
,,Lovely place!,5.0,,Really love it there. Visiting it occasionally in a long while still always feels like the first time of visit. Fascination and awe.
,,Simply Perfect,5.0,,"I had a great time walking around and enjoying the beautiful plants on display here. Very cooling and refreshing to visit on a hot day. The man made fountain, the elevated trail were superb . Highly recommended attraction visitors of Singapioe should not be missed."
,,Cool place,5.0,,"It was a nice surprise to come to Cloud Forest. It is breath taking and a beautiful view. Come in the late afternoon before sunset and see the progression, you see the Sunset from the see through the glass dome. Then take a walk outside after you have finish admiring the Forest."
,,CLOSE TO NATURE,5.0,,"This is an excellent place to visit. While enjoying the cool ambience especially in this hot and humid weather, we are very close to nature. Trust me, you will love to visit again and again. Make your trip there when you are next available."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Worthwhile visiting this place, it offers beautiful and scenic plant visions, set in an interesting and attractive display arrangement."
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,Was excited to see the indoor waterfall in real life after seeing so many photos before my visit.. it didn’t disappoint! It’s not easy trying to get a photo as everyone’s trying to do the same but it really is amazing.
,,Worth going to,4.0,,"Lovely relaxing stroll around stunning gardens, Everywhere you look you will see something beautiful, So much to look at."
,,Interesting green cloud and skywalk,5.0,,Nicely curated and maintained structure of green with variety of plants which makes you feel fresh while walking around.
,,"Loved it,",5.0,,Great place to explore and see beautiful orchids! Plus the gardens by the bay are near by. Fun light show outside at night!
,,Keep it for the Rainy Day in Singapore- Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful unique indoor experience . Keep it for a rainy day in Singapore and combine it with the Gardens and Marina Bay Sands
,,An impressive visit.,4.0,,This dome enables you to walk around a cascading waterfall and walls of plants. The walkway is quite high and creates a feeling of actually being in a cloud forest...well worthwhile.
,,Magical,4.0,,"I had no idea what to expect of this as I did not pre look at photos, & I’m glad I didn’t. We were instantly struck by the magical quality of the water fall as you walk in. The entire garden space is so impressive. The only partial negative is the waiting time to get up to the top to make your way back down again."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A unique experience! The waterfall gives the dome its magic and makes the indoor climate nice. Make sure you go to the top of the waterfall and pass thru every experience when you go down from 1 floor to the other.
,,nice retreat from the heat,3.0,,not only for botanic fans but everyone who wants to cool down a bit from the stressing sight-seeing. big indoor waterfall and nice cool climate inside. different levels to climb up. nice arrangement.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing nice & cool aircon, which was a pleasure as Singapore is so humid so is a nice break from the heat outside. The walk ways are a great way to see all the plants waterfalls etc.... @ various different heights. The flower is really good to but the cloud forest was my favourite, we went in the flower dome first then the Cloud forest dome In recommend doing it in this order."
,,Awesome,5.0,,A definite must see for young and old. everyone catered for in entire area. Could not fault anything.
,,Magic spot,4.0,,This is like walking in into a dream world. Plants you cannot beleive in a spectacular environment. Very satisfactory but unfortunately too crowded to be able to enjoy fully.
,,Cool and crowded,4.0,,"A big air conditioned glass dome with an indoor waterfall, plants and too many visitors. Can get a bit too annoying especially near the entrance which flaunts an indoor waterfall. Has an entry fee and closing time."
,,Overrated Cloud Forest.,3.0,,"CloudForest is one of the two buildings. This one houses a large manmade waterfall. And a huge catwalk around the higher part of the building. Supposedly one walks on clouds. Failure comes from the way the CloudForest Show is being introduced to the guests poorly.
I was disappointed."
,,AIR CON!,5.0,,Visited Singapore multiple times and never get tired of visiting the gardens. Always manages to take my breath away. But I cannot stress how amazing the air conditioning is! It’s a great way to escape the heat while still doing an enjoyable activity.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Great place to visit. Showing different aspects of the world. It took lots of imagination to create this.
,,Beautiful Forest that is a great place to cool down!,5.0,,"Besides the incredibly stunning plants, flowers and waterfall, this place is air conditioned which was an amazing respite from the outside humidity."
,,All Airconditioned Wonder,4.0,,"Dont let the heat beat you as the Cloud forest and the Flower domes are fully air conditioned. Cloud Forest provides the greatest attraction and its huge. How they maintain is amazing. The cloud forest has one problem, it can get crowded especially in the evening. I would suggest going in afternoon. Its Air cooled so you will have no hassle."
,,A little too crowded to appreciate fully.,3.0,,"This is no doubt a spectacular venue and would be very serene with fewer people than we experienced. We did go on an evening at a very popular time so we should have anticipated a lot of people. We did spend a lot of time trying not to walk into photographs which did distract a little from our enjoyment of the surroundings. It was hard to stop and just take in the experience without getting in the way of other people. The entry fee is quite expensive so I couldn't really suggest we got good value. We were glad we went, although but if we had picked our time more carefully I think it would have been much better. I recommend going at a quieter time of the day."
,,Wow!,5.0,,What a stunning and beautiful experience it was to go the cloud forest. The effort that must go into maintaining such a beautiful attraction is unbelievable! The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The gardens were amazing! Would totally recommend people check this place out if they have time
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Just an amazing place to visit. Not only do you get away from the sweltering heat of outside but you get to see some beautiful plants. The sculptures dotted around were really interesting too and really added to the whole experience.

The walkways are high but you feel perfectly safe on them.

Highly recommended."
,,Spuer Duper !!!,5.0,,One of the Dome of Garden by the Bay with many many different plants and other vegetation. Uniquely designed.
,,Cloud Forest - What a creation,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is an awesome creation and concept. It is a different world covered by mist, surrounded by diverse plants and hidden flowers. You should visit this unique place at least once in your life....."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"This is an awesome place to be. If you love nature you would definitely be interested in this.
In that limited area so many variety of Flora is just amazing. Then is the water fall as well.
If you want to go to the top and walk on the glass wall way then you need to take the elevator. On weekends 15 mins is waiting time for elevator."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,very nice place next to garden at bay. Lots of beautiful statue and different flowers there is water fall at one end.
,,Absolute pleasure,5.0,,"A great experience, but do carry jackets because when then fog comes in it does get a little chilly. Again very very crowded and hence plan in advance."
,,The Awareness Center about the climate Change,4.0,,This is a part of the Gardens by the Bay. It developed as a large green house. You can enjoy the time you spend there by natural beauties and the recent facts about our planet.
,,Really up in the clouds,5.0,,"What an amazing spectacle, and how high can you go to explore. The amazing displays, the water features and tropical wonderland of exotic plants..and it's air conditioned. Cues were managed well and a real WOW."
,,Man made wonder,5.0,,"The cloud forest is a man made wonder. That water is breathtaking. The skywalks, the flora, the installations, each thing here is just fantastic. This one can't be missed if you visit Singapore. I could spend hours here. Highly recommend it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Words cannot describe this place you've got to go to experience this unbelievable sight.This place gets busy so go as early as you can,at different times they turn on the mist sprayer so so try to find out what time before you go."
,,A haven for horticulture enthusiasts and nature lovers!,4.0,,"An Amazing man-made mountain showcasing the world’s tallest indoor waterfall, all beautifully landscaped with lush vegetation. A haven for horticulture enthusiasts and nature lovers! Tickets are quite expensive ... not sure if it's really worth the ticket price."
,,Breathtaking display of conservation,5.0,,"I visited the Cloud Forest last year with some friends and was keen to take my girlfriend this year as she had never been, I loved it just as much the second time and she was blown away by how impressively gorgeous every little detail of the Cloud Forest was."
,,Amazing plant life,5.0,,"Beautiful dome, amazing plant life. Can get busy, but mostly people traffic is managed well. Great activity when singapore heat or rain becomes overwhelming. Come prepared with a snack as is can take a while to get through and the options outside are limited or with long queues.
By contrast I found the flower dome overwhelming with people and not particularly interesting plant life."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"A beautiful place to spend some time. Amazing views, fantastic waterfall, such an inspiring place to be. My family loved it."
,,Lovely,5.0,,Focus is a cascade and the flora around it. You take the lift to the top and walk your way down. A lovely way to spend a rainy afternoon.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Wow, what a great experience. A must if you visit Gardens by the Bay. I went there soon after opening and there were no waiting time to get in."
,,Educational and fascinating,5.0,,Third visit. Still learning something new and am sure I'll go again on our next trip. Good for all ages with or without kids.
,,Incredible!!,5.0,,Stunningly beautiful! There is also educational information about climate change which was really good. I was stunned how visually stunning this place was!
,,A man made waterfall that looks more natural,5.0,,The vertical green forest looks more amazing with the water falling in full flow. The little drops falling on you makes your senses fresh and energetic at the same time.
,,"Combine with the Flower dome, Marina Bay Skypark and the water show",5.0,,"You can spend the whole day here. However if you are short of time, half a day will be enough. Nice to sit at the sea shore near the Forest."
,,Simply superb,5.0,,"WOW. That's what I felt as soon as you enter cloud forest. It's a great place to escape Singapore heat. Truly soothing. Lots of gardens and flowers. Seems like you are in a tropical state.

Will easily take an hour but its worth every minute. Not to be missed as you may not encounter such an incredible place anywhere else !!"
,,Breathtakingly beautiful!,5.0,,Do NOT miss the Cloud Forest when you're in Singapore. The amount of imagination and planning that resulted in this attraction is mind boggling!
,,Good,5.0,,"It is very good to see plants from around the world at one place.
It's such as amusement.how they managed to create a scene like an ancient cave covered with plants & trees outside.
Waterfall is amazing.
A man made thing which has a must look."
,,Incredible,5.0,,Really enjoyed this - again you get sick of people blocking walkways and just stopping to get the perfect selfie. Just ignore them and you will love this
,,Nature lover,5.0,,Amazing architectural nature-artistic elegance! Cool place to visit when it’s hot outside.Perfect 👍
,,"Amazing, and cool temps :-)",5.0,,"Absolutely first-rate experience, worth every penny of admission. Plan to relax and take your time to soak it all in and enjoy. Come early on a weekday if at all possible otherwise the crowds are challenging."
,,A place inside Gardens By The Bay.,5.0,,A very places of this grandeur. A must visit place if going to Singapore. Feel the pulse and the chill. Beautifully destined and neat and clean. Pollution-free environment.
,,Singapore adventure,5.0,,"To be honest thought I may get bored , far from it , trip was good particularly the light show. Interesting to see what we're doing to our planet"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Spectacular attraction - can get quite busy but totally worth it. We did this in the late afternoon prior to the light show and seeing it all lit up was something special
,,Highlight at Garden by the Bay,5.0,,Loved the waterfalls and whimsical sculptures tucked between the plants. This is a cool place to visit when it is hot outside. They really have a wide variety of plants on display and it was fun to see many we have never seen before.
,,the beauty of singapore,5.0,,Singapore does an amazing job of mixing technology and nature. This place is beautiful of course. Short walk from Marina Bay and just across the Helix bridge from the best shopping in the world...Marina Bay Mall is a bit pricey.
,,Must see when you visit Singapore,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest houses the worlds tallest indoor waterfall and an exquisite range of tropical and rain forest plants. We were delighted to see they even had one of Australia's rare Wollomi Pines trees and the most gorgeous collection of orchids were on display when we were there. There are stalagmites, stalactites and crystals amethyst caves. Fascinating and interesting. We loved it."
,,Fantastic escape,4.0,,"Gorgeous garden and escape from the concrete jungle of Singapore. Its not a huge exhibition, but it is unlike anything else I have seen and its a cool break from Singapore city."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"This was an amazing experience. There is so much to view and discover in Cloud Forest.
It is extremely well done, with the plant life seemingly integrated into the structure naturally. You do wonder how some of the gardening and maintenance is performed.
Please make sure to allow yourself sufficient time to explore properly."
,,Very nice,5.0,,Beautiful attraction and a cooling respite from the Singapore heat. Very well maintained and the indoor waterfall was very special
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Lots of learning, and I love how they showed how Gardens by the Bay is environmentally friendly itself."
,,Best skybridge,5.0,,"Visited here often when I had the annual pass. Recently visited here since the cost of this ticket with Flower Dome is more value for money. Nice waterfall, and ""trekking"" comfortably in the aircon. Very well-trained and organized staffing at elevators to guide visitors. Great for kids, nice skybridge."
,,Best indoor waterfall,5.0,,"This is a definite must see in Singapore. Gorgeous garden walls and an orchid walk way. Truly a beautiful place for all people and great views of the city. I also enjoyed the fact they are pushing the fact of reduce waste, recycle and save our world!"
,,An amazing done with a tropical rain forest within !!!,5.0,,A treat for plant lovers.Very well built glass cloud forest dome.Once you enter the dome there is a huge waterfalls.The walk right to the top is very gentle and not difficult even for older people. Overall an amazing place to spend the evening.
,,Amazing tropical garden,5.0,,"I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did. It really was an incredible thing to experience -- the waterfall, the abundance of plants in there, the genius design of it all, some of the tranquil spots at the base... Definitely worth visiting. (Also, it was air-conditioned inside -- bonus!)"
,,Indiana Jones Style,5.0,,"With so many levels to explore and so many statues and plants ,this dome is much more than we thought. Another must do in Singapore"
,,wowwwwwwwwwwww,5.0,,it is one the most amazing places I HAVE EVER visited.In every step you will face something awesome.The ticket was reasonable but i can not remember the exact fee.
,,Welcome respite from the heat,5.0,,"We went on a weekday morning, so not too many people (although there was a group of school children with their teacher). The Cloud Forest provided a welcome respite from the heat and humidity outside. The waterfall was amazing! There's a schedule of misting, which happened right before we came in, so the air was very cool. Lots of beautiful plants and displays to enjoy and learn about."
,,Enter in world of clouds,5.0,,"When you enter this dome, a water fall welcomes you and it gets better when you climb up. The diversity is unique and the dome is well maintained."
,,Beautiful sights in singapore,5.0,,This is must visit garden. The water fall is amazing. The temperature inside very moderate and close to cold. The artificial clouds and smells are amazing. You must not miss this place if you are visiting Garden by the bays.
,,Overrated,3.0,,"The concept is interesting, the execution has some issues, and the crowds were a real drawback. I think the vegetation was very nice, but in some instances, the displays weren't as nice as I'd hoped. There were some tall walls of plantings that were impressive until you saw through areas to see walkways and railings. I think that took away from the impact of the plantings. I found it to be much too crowded to enjoy our time in the dome.

In our opinion, it was not worth the cost. We would not visit this again.

We found it difficult to enjoy the exhibits when we were constantly stopping to avoid interfering with selfies or other photo taking. It felt like visitors were more interested in the exhibit as backdrop for photos than in the exhibits themselves. Perhaps they should regulate the flow of people they allow through the exhibit. It was so crowded that we walked through and then asked for directions to the exit without going to the top of the dome."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Well worth the money, especially if you’re into greenery and beauty! Wear comfortable shoes and clothes, lots to see—beautiful!"
,,Bookend of a great attraction,5.0,,"One of the two pillars of the Gardens by the Bay complex, the Cloud Forest is topiary and landscape architecture on a grand scale. The air is alive with the verdant scent of the ecosystem within its sculpted glass and iron ceilings; the superstructure alone is a work of art unto itself.

Exhibits are both beautiful and informative, and air conditioning is always present to ensure that you're able to enjoy the experience in comfort. Loved this place - well worth a few hours on its own."
,,Amazing wooden sculptures,5.0,,Hidden in amongst the lush greenery were some fabulous driftwood type sculptures and we loved climbing up 'inside' the waterfall.
,,Very Busy!,3.0,,"This is one of two domes and overall i wasn't too impressed, it's all a bit Disneyfied, with gimmicks which don't really translate to the natural theme they are promoting. I am guessing they are doing this to make the place more child friendly. The crowds however were intolerable. The lift in one of the domes which you have to take in order to access the upper levels was so busy you had a 30 min wait all squashed together as they herded you closer. We decided to leave which was a shame because the tickets aren't cheap but it isn't my idea of fun. The management should think about limiting numbers. Notwithstanding this - i think these are worth visiting because they are impressive - it's just not the enjoyable experience you would like. The horticultural aspect is fantastic but if they keep adding statues it will start looking really tacky and detract from the original point of these domes."
,,Educational,4.0,,Was a very nice visit to this place. The architecture was amazing and I felt very relaxed in this place
,,Great,5.0,,"Must visit place, the waterfalls is in front of you once step in the Cloud Forest, it is very attractive one, understand why so many people will spend a quite of time to picture taking there. Cool place and the vertical flower is beautiful, feeling very touching they will close the Dome one day for monthly maintenance."
,,Paradise for green lovers,4.0,,Have created a jungle in indoor. The place will motivate u to plant more trees and love for trees. But small kids will not find any interest they can get bored easily out here. So plan according ly...
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,"As for the Garden a great experience, a must see on your next visit to Singapore. Make sure that you take in the complete experience here as it is well worth while . the time."
,,Pictures are better,4.0,,"I “must do” when in Singapore, but unless a botanist, it’s pretty but not too exciting. The waterfall at the start is lovely."
,,Walk in the Mist,4.0,,"We stood in a line for over an hour to get to the elevator to the top floor. Beautiful place but like everything in Singapore, it was crowded, which diminishes the enjoyment. However if you are in Singapore then it is a must see"
,,Tropical Paradise,5.0,,"One is transported into an amazing world of tropical plants,trees,ferns,orchids and flowers complete with waterfalls and mist!One climbs up a winding walkway from ground level to the canopy of trees and also gets a surrealistic look at the modern skyscrapers and the harbour through the glass walls."
,,Gardens of all over world in one place,5.0,,"very excellent, nicely maintained all plants and tree of various place of the world in on cloud forest some rare plants also found in the six floor cloud forest."
,,amazing forest,4.0,,"natural air conditioning, cool place with many plenties variances of plants. please come on weekday or not peak season time so you can have time to more explore it."
,,Great way to escape the heat!,5.0,,"When you're in Singapore and walking around in the heat all day, there's no better way to escape the heat than by going to the Cloud Forest (and Flower Dome).
These two places are amazing. You feel totally transported to another place and time in the Cloud Forest and can almost forget you are in the bustling modern city of Singapore. Even our kids (13 and 11) were fascinated by the historical greenery. We highly recommend it."
,,Surprinsingly good and interesting,4.0,,"We ended up here because a storm fell on us right at that time and it was impossible to leave the area, so we paid the pricey ticket for both natural spaces.
This ended up being quite entertaining , instructive and pretty actually. Something I would recommend, also if you travel with children as it stresses the importance of the environment and its protection."
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,"Hello traveller!

Cloud Forest is lovely to view and walk through. However, the ticket price was not worth the 5 min visitation as the location is small. If you choose to go to Cloud Forest you are ""forced"" to buy entry into two places. I get it, but also from the perspective of a traveller - umh, felt weird."
,,The Cloud Forest itself is great but try to avoid crowds,4.0,,"The attraction itself is great and interesting, but the elevator to the top of the Forest gets heavily crowded during peak hours. SO might be good idea to visit early."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,This was one of our favorite gardens we've ever visited. So beautiful and even better than expected.
,,Beautiful indoor rainforest,5.0,,Spectacular indoor rainforest with its waterfalls and hundreds of plants species. A refreshing visit to escape the heat of Singapore.
,,Beautiful internal rainforest,5.0,,This really is quite a spectacle. It is a beautiful rain forest in the largest green house I have ever entered. You can climb to the top and walk around the forest. Very pretty
,,Fantastic Place in Singapore! MUST SEE!,5.0,,"Went here, and it didn't disappoint! It was a sight to see, real clouds and a lovely cold atmosphere in such a warm climate! You need to buy tickets for both Gardens by the Bay and Cloud forest together so its definitely the better of the two! Must see!"
,,Amazing inside garden,5.0,,This garden is just amazing. To think that this was man made and is such a feast for the eyes. Highly recommend a visit and is stroller/wheelchair friendly
,,Must go here,5.0,,"Fantastic, beautiful words can’t describe how wonderful the cloud gardens are. My best advice is try to avoid going here on a weekend as it can be crowded but the gardens are so great you won’t mind wasting. The dome is air conditioned and very comfortable. Make sure to spend time about the different types of orchids."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We did this with gardens by the bay, it is well worth paying to do all 3 activities as they are all fantastic, it takes a time to see all and we stopped for coffee and a cake at a nice little cafe in the park.
A must to see when in town and we did it about 9.30 and easy to get to by taxi."
,,Simply Amazing,5.0,,Singapore are masters of tourist attractions and this certainly doesn't fail. I went there not really knowing what to expect but was blown away. I could have easily spent a day there exploring every nook and cranny but didn't have that much time. Highly recommended!
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Words can not express how fantastic this is. Singapore have mastered the rain fall of greenery not only in this spectacular place but at the botanical gardens The Park royal hotel is the same. It’s a must see and it’s Air con makes it all very easy to walk through.
,,2nd tallest waterfall in singapore,4.0,,"The only things attract me is 2nd tallest mam-made waterfall. It's amazing. Other then flower, there is crystal & some infomation of global warming issue."
,,Superb Supertree Niggt Light show,5.0,,"Well this is my top attraction and sadly can only give 5* on the Trip Advisor app so hete is is my own 6*.
This was an amazing night time totally imnersive and utterly beautiful experience. Vast, rainforest tall, artificial trees towered above as we laid on benches watching this mesmerising and beautifully choreographed light and music show.
The experience will stay with you."
,,ARTIFICIAL WATER FALLS,3.0,,"Its a artificial water falls, but once you enter this cloud forest you experience the natural touch."
,,Spectacular!!!!!,5.0,,I never tire of visiting the cloud forest. There is something magical about this place. It is one of the reasons we stop in Singapore every chance we get. We were fortunate to smell the fragrant orchid display. What a sensory delight. I applaud the Singaporean’s on their ingenuity and their obvious love for all things beautiful. A must to see.
,,Amazed once you enter the area,5.0,,"I really loved it when i stepped into this place. The waterfall was really beautiful and of course , Best place to take a Instagram! Walk around the place to see more flowers ."
,,Be prepared to be amazed,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore is a wonderland of plants, flowers and sculptures. The first thing you see is a large waterfall which gives you a beautiful mist to cool you when it can be humid outside in the gardens. At the top of the display it is breathtaking with an eary mist and amazing displays of tropical plants. Not to be missed. Excuse the pun!"
,,nicely maintain and freshly flowers,5.0,,"was there yesterday. those flowers were beautiful. the roses, surprises that so many colors and the smell were good too."
,,An impressive edifice,5.0,,Well worth a visit even if you are not necessarily interested in flowers and gardening. Don't bother with the adjoining food court. The meal we was like a supermarket ready meal. the most disappointing meal we had in Singapore.
,,Rainforest,5.0,,"Fantastic display of flowers, orchids and rainforest plants. All with in a very nicely temperature dome."
,,Good for Botany education,5.0,,Clearly the best Concrete Jungle in the world. One can pretty much witness all the species from around the world. It is truly amazing to see new species and a learning curve for younger kids. We really enjoyed ourselves. Nice eateries and we loved the Super Trees and animations.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,This is what I call the forest in the dome. The climate is artificial but it feels so real. It was like we were really in the middle of the jungle.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,One of the most beautiful forest admist the Botanical Gardens in Singapore.. A must see! You will not be disappointed!
,,Cool Forest,5.0,,"Nice cool way to view a forest. Good for a leisure stroll in hot humid Singapore. Suitable for couple, group of friends, family or corporate gathering."
,,Feel the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"It was a nice experience that we had in our visit. The waterfall in the entrance is pleasant to watch, climbing up and seeing it from top is as well. The design and architecture is very well done. It takes around 45 minutes inside."
,,Green place to be on a hot hot day,4.0,,"Last I remembered, it was far less crowded before and it was a very pleasant experience. On my last visit, there was a line to go up. The sky bridge was full of photo folks and we had to stop ever so often. My best advice is the avoid the peak period. During my time of visit, it was early evening just before the light show. Overall, still a great place to visit and stay cool."
,,Cool in more ways than one.,5.0,,"The cloud forest can get very busy from 4pm onwards so we headed there around 2pm and avoided the crowds. Stunning dome packed with plants, orchids and complete with its own waterfall which also helps keep it cool. Once inside you can catch a lift up to the top floor and the work your way down via the platform paths. A must see in Singapore."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Amazing- simply stunning. My two boys (3and 4)and wife absolutely loved the tour. A must see whilst in Singapore. We will be back 👍
,,Beautiful but with huge crowds and very long lines,3.0,,"It seems we went during peak period as our experience was mostly spent shuffling along a very long line, looking up occasionally at this beautiful man-made sculpture in front of us. We don't do well in crowds, so we hopped out of the line after 20 minutes of shuffling. The lines were mostly orderly with staff in attendance to show us where the exit was and they were very nice and helpful. I would not recommend bringing young children during peak periods as they'll get crushed or will get tired. It's a very long wait to get to the top."
,,"Wonderful visit, I highly recommend, beautiful forest and great air con!",5.0,,"Wonderful visit, I highly recommend, beautiful forest and great air con and waterfall. To include in your visits in Singapore."
,,Better of the two observatories,5.0,,"The two domes of Cloud Forest and Flower dome attract most crowds. Having seen both we can pick a clear favorite, Cloud Forest is more interactive and has a lot more to see and do. If you're pressed for time, this one is the one you should choose.

Every few hours they have a cloud and mist formation feature. Fast lifts carry you up and you walk your way down seeing a variety of plants. The observatory is set up like a mountain with a water fall feature at its heart. The short movie show detailing how humans have ravaged nature and what needs to be done is eye opening."
,,Very impressive attraction,5.0,,"For us, this was the highlight of visiting Gardens by the Bay. The place is set inside a huge glass done with a ""mountain"" in the center and a lift that takes you up to the higher levels and a path that allows you to leisurely wander down with spectacular views of the rich foliage and flowers all around. There was a bit of a queue to get into the lift, but a staff member directed us to the fire lift which had no queue at all.

Within this attraction is a waterfall, orchid area, secret garden, crystal cave and a short film just as you leave the place and before entering the gift shop. You can also get glimpses of the Marine Bay Sands Hotel and the Supertree Grove.

As a group of six with two young kids, everyone thought the place was wonderful, including the kids who had a very fun time. I would thoroughly recommend anyone to include the Cloud Forest in their visit to Gardens by the Bay."
,,One of the best places in Singapore,5.0,,"This is an artificial forest which has a waterfall. The height is about 35 meter, and the height is split into different floors. Each floor has some attractions."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"There cant be a better name for this place, it literally is a cloud forest. A marvel where nature meets human engineering and a most welcome respite from Singapore’s heat."
,,In and out in 3 min,2.0,,"You walk the downstairs through in three minutes. There is a lift to upstairs, but the line was over 20 minutes long, so we skipped it."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Whilst visiting the gardens we bought a combined ticket for the flower dome and cloud forest.
It did feel slightly like a Disney attraction, as there is a set route that everyone walks and although we went fairly early, can imagine in busy times it could get very crowded."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"One of the two domes, we bought tickets online & it was best value to get two domes plus Floral Fantasy together.
There’s a free shuttle from the main entry area, which was very welcome, as I struggled walking around in the heat.
The dome is climate controlled, and while steamy, is cooler than outside.
Absolutely full of beautiful flowers and lush foliage, this dome focuses on the differing levels of rainforest plants.
Thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
,,Very Coooool,5.0,,"The planning effort that went into this project is truly amazing, there is so much to see, we spent 5 hours inside this magnificent dome. Full credit to Singapore for designing such a beautiful structure. This is a must do."
,,Not too impress,3.0,,"Nicely display but nothing outstanding. Watch out, you might get wet from the water fall. Some interesting rocks"
,,Good place to visit for flowers lovers,5.0,,Even though we need to queue on our way in but it was so worth it. The going into the 6th floor to pass the bridge so we can see the scenery outside the building then we walked around to enjoy the flower exhibition. So beautiful!
,,Chill out in the domes,5.0,,"I go to as many botanical gardens as I can wherever I travel. One of my favorites in the world. It is worth the cost of admission to the domes for so many beautiful specimens and the air conditioning! Kids will love the very unique plants, trees, and flowers. LEGO sculptures are in the carnivorous plants section of the cloud forest."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,A wonderful experience of being in a rain forest environment with some of the most beautiful plants round every corner. You can go higher and higher to be behind the high waterfall. We spent a lot of time in Cloud Forest enjoying everything about it.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,It may not sound very interesting however family travellers and nature lovers must visit this place. The air changes as soon as you enter the place. The waterfall was super and the information about the earth and nature displayed is worth a visit. You will need to give at least 1.5 hours and maximum of 3 hours.
,,Must for everyone,5.0,,Going to Singapore the cloud Forest is a must to amaze anyone.the marketing that has gone into this is fantastic. Something I will never forget

A credit to Singapore and its people."

,,COOL PLACE,5.0,,"lush vegetation of the tropical highlands & a tall waterfall in a soaring, contemporary greenhouse..."
,,Great Adventure !,4.0,,A must visit when you’re in Singapore! Worth the monies for the gardens and cloud forest!so many beautiful plants and flowers to see!
,,Great place to visit if its raining,5.0,,This place charges a fee to enter but well worth it to get out of the rain and humidity. Beautifully done and very cool inside.
,,Cool,5.0,,Super cool mountain with a 6 story tall water fall inside a glass dome covered in tropical flowers and plants. A must see
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"The cloud forest is with a trip, and has easy acess for prams and wheelchairs. There are ramps or lifts available. It is air conditioned so great to escape the humidity and heat of the city."
,,Back again,5.0,,My daughters and I visited the Cloud Forest in 2017 but couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit it again after going through the Flower Dome for the first time. Once again we thoroughly enjoyed seeing the huge waterfall and all the other plants and exhibits. It is such a uniqiue place to see and so cool inside after the heat of the day.
,,Water fall.,5.0,,The look and green house for plants is amazing they maintain the temperature in it. Water fall n it's view is sizzling top to see and feel the glace of water drops on you will make you feel such an Haven.
,,Amazing Forest with waterfalls,5.0,,"We experienced this Cloud Forest on our last day in Singapore and were not disappointed. Such a beautiful set up with amazing plants, and trees and water features. There is even a surprise at the very top to view. The waterfall is truly amazing and for a photo shoot, I would highly recommend.
Overall worth going to view if you have the time."
,,Another Amazing Display,4.0,,Another venue that almost blows you away because of its size and the flora on display. Great photo opportunities and an amazing structure.
,,one of its kind,5.0,,"cloud forrest is one of its kind. Singapore keeps coming up with something new and extraordinary on every visit of mine. This is a must visit for the way it is planned, beauty of the flowers and the number of varieties of plants in the dome"

,,Forest and nature within the city,5.0,,"It felt like being transported to a new world the moment we stepped into the entrance to Cloud Forest. We were greeted by a huge waterfall and imposing structure. Truly beautiful and breath-taking! Make sure you take your time to explore all levels of the cloud forest. Definitely worth it. It provides easily accessible pathways, and the walk can be at a moderate pace to enjoy the surroundings. One can see the flora and fauna of a forest without having to exert the physical exhaustion of climbing a mountain to see the different plants and foliage that exists at different levels of the forest, and the pleasant air-conditioning makes the visit very comfortable."
,,Nice.. but extremely overcrowded,2.0,,"After queuing to get in, I walked through to find a sea of people trying to get selfies and pictures with the waterfall. This was to the point that I could not get past. You have to follow the crowd round in a conveyor belt style fashion. You get crammed into an elevator and taken to the top where the trend continues. I felt very uncomfortable the whole way round and was very happy to leave.

On a day where there is fewer people this may have been a more pleasant experience."
,,Mind blowing!,5.0,,This is such an amazing structure with an incredible collection of plants. Truly beautiful. Entrance fee is payable but well worth the cost.
,,What a superb visit & well worth the money,5.0,,"Although visiting Gardens on the Bay is free, visits to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are chargeable by a combined entry ticket. We paid 28 Singapore dollars each for the adult entry ticket for both domes in April 2019. We were absolutely amazed by the Cloud Dome and spent a couple of hours there. It was easy to get around, even for families with children in pushchairs of for disabled persons as there are lifts as well as ramp walkways. Their collection of insectivorous plants was amazing and the whole dome was presented as a mountainous forest with waterfalls. It was so carfellly planned out and must take a lot of effort to maintain. There were many beautiful pieces of sculpture incorporated into the displays. Well worth a visit."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Very cool and amazing place, variety of flowers and plant . Must see and very interesting place, great for those who love nature especially plants."
,,Cooling Rainforest in the tropical Singapore,4.0,,This great and beautiful Cloud Forest in the tropical Singapore is worthy of your visit in Singapore. You will get to enjoy this and quiet getaway unlike the Flower Dome which is just nearby. Nice and beautiful variety of flowers for your enjoyment and nature appreciation with cool breeze ambiance. Different themes are changed occasionally so worthy of visitation.
,,How cool is this place???,5.0,,"When we went to the gardens I expected just about that... gardens, though I knew there were a couple of domes, we went into the flower garden dome 1st and that was cool, the Cloud Forest usurped it just by the sheer number of plants, the variety and the spiral walkway.

Then to finish there were a couple movies and though the content was excellent about conservation and climate change, they should have had it showing either in other languages or include sub titles.

There were patrons from countries who blatantly disregard the welfare of the world and they should be made aware of these films content.

Truely wonderful place to visit."
,,so fresh inside so hot outside,5.0,,very well realized a lot of plants and flowers that we don t know the view from the top is impressive well organized

,,Spectacular,4.0,,"This is a very big, very well laid out greenhouse. Climbing to the top is a must nad the walk back down again must be done. When it is hot and humid outside, standing by the waterfall is very refreshing. A recommended 'must do'."
,,Waterfall,4.0,,"It is worth seeing but remember to go early enough so you can get entry into both greenhouses. Last admission was about 8pm. There is basically a massive waterfall and lots of plants, It is quite nice and worth seeing."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,Air conditioned so great on stinking hot days. Allow time to look at hidden sculptures and smaller plants.

,,Amazing concept & design,5.0,,Cloud forest is in one of the domes of the gardens by the bay...the waterfall gives it a rainforest makeup...the various levels of walkways & species of flowers & wild vegetation is just so natural...the section of carnivorous plants was awsome...must visit for all tourists
,,Just superb,5.0,,"For a botanic garden, this is a real gem. Worth every penny going in to see, you don't have to be a gardener or naturalist ot enjoy it, it is just worth seeing."
,,So much better than anticipated...,5.0,,"Was expecting something very commercial and busy, which it is BUT it is so incredibly well done! The scale of the dome is impressive and the plantings just blow your mind! This is really not to be missed. Loved the education parts too...although I think the conservation messaging needs to be in other languages too...not just English.....Japanese, Cantonese and Hindu maybe? The cloud walk is fabulous...and so many interesting plants and art pieces"
,,A must-do.,5.0,,Really fun to go through this place. Lots of great photo ops. People from all over the world enjoy this place.

,,Very enjoyable,5.0,,This place was simply wonderful and is hands-down the best part of Gardens by the bay. Gorgeous and cooling waterfall and flora that will just blow you away. Lots of places to take some great pics but as other reviewers have mentioned crowds could make it less special.
,,A great job!,5.0,,"If you are visiting the Gardens by the Bay, don't miss the Cloud Forest - an amazing area full of trees and plants showing the beauty of nature. You need an hour to visit it."
,,Magical waterfall,4.0,,Wow what a waterfall and a great way to cool off. Such amazing plants. The waterfall is huge and creates a mystical environment when you walk in. Great visit -very calming.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"With the heat of Singapore it was a relief to get inside this habitat. Greeted with a huge waterfall and then lead through a maze of wonderful exhibits, including beautiful orchids. All covers the importance of the forests and the consequences of man’s greed and carelessness. You have to visit!"
,,Singapore Garden Solo holiday,5.0,,"My visit to cloud forest was one of the highlights of my trip to Singapore. The views from the top of the mountain were amazing, and the plants were just beautiful. As this is a cool climate display it is a good idea to take a jacket or wrap as l was cold after the tropical heat outside."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,I could spend hours here. There is so much to see. It takes your breath away as you first enter with the waterfall. Just follow the path and enjoy. Read all the little signs.
,,Beautiful at dusk,4.0,,"Crowded during the weekend. A very nice place. When you walk the winding bridge at pre-dusk, that's the most beautiful moment."

,,Great place to spend the day,5.0,,"The cloud forest is an amazing place to spend a hot morning! the nature, the waterfall and the mist give you the impression that you are in a different place and time!"
,,Amazing gardens !,4.0,,"First up the place is beautiful and cool
Second it’s busy and crowded like all of Singapore but the queues for the cloud walk moves very fast and worth the wait
There were a few arguments in the queue with people pushing in so some better crown management may assist !"
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,I still can't wrap my hear round the fact that this is all man made! Its really amazing. Be prepared fo the crowds though - we went at midday and already there were quite a lot of people. Also wouldn't advise you to go all the way up if you're afraid of heights!
,,Best part of park,4.0,,"Having waited for the rain to clear to get into the park in the first instance, the cloud forest dome was perhaps less anticipated than the flower dome but certainly proved to be much much more interesting with its waterfalls and high level walks. Not to be missed when visiting the Marina Bay Park"
,,Cool and Picturesque waterfalls,5.0,,This is a great place to visit. They have tram services inside and also it is completely mind blowing. Good artificial waterfalls that makes you relaxed
,,Amazing garden elevated into the sky.,5.0,,"Cloud Forest was just awesome with wonderful displays & elevated walkways was incredible taking you thru all the various levels.
This forest should be on your agenda when visiting this city.
Waterfall was amazing & the way the professional landscape gardeners have designed it, never seen anything like it.

,,"Awesome display of vegetation, and documentary",5.0,,"Make time to visit the Cloud Forest as well as the Flower Dome, when you are in Singapore.
It had been a Long time since I last visited this place. Man-made Waterfall inside the Observatory, with numerous plants, vegetation, varieties of orchids, together with crystal mountain and a short documentary at the end of the whole exhibits.

Am so proud of being a Singaporean, and the great effort in setting up this Cloud Forest Observatory in the Gardens By The Bay.

Take your time to walk along the walkway, and be amazed by the lush greenery. Sustainable energy and sustainable practices being upheld in this vast garden in the heart of Marina Bay.

You could easily spend one to one and a half hour inside here. There is the Flower Dome right opposite. Go Cycling or jogging along the trail. Shuttle bus are available starting from the Bay Plaza, right outside of Bayfront MRT, at the entrance to the garden.

Don't forget to take a walk along the OCBC Skywalk, for panoramic views of our city. Enjoy a meal at Satay By The Bay street food dining area.

In the evening, come back for the Light Show at Gardens By The Bay at 7.45 pm or 8.45 pm.

Welcome to Singapore"
,,Stunning,5.0,,Combined with the gardens this is well worth visiting. Not to be missed in Singapore. Just do it. The queue was a little long to get tickets but the big fan kept us comfortable while waiting.
,,A must do in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Cloud forest is designed to provide a close up feel of a tropical jungle with a huge waterfall at the entrance. The artificial waterfall is spectacular and the hollow structure that houses the waterfall is also adorned with numerous plants all around.

After passing the waterfall, one gets to go around the forest structure and take a lift to climb to the terrace which is artistically decorated with various jungle plants. The highlight of the terrace is the carnivorous plants that you can see from close up!

From the terrace, you walk through a forest pathway adorned with all sorts of tropical plants and enter the inside of the hollow mountain where the limestone formations are preserved along with some educational information. You also get to see the waterfall from a balcony which is a perfect photo point.

Plan to spend at least 1 hour as the cloud forest is also air conditioned and serves as a great escape from the heat outside especially in the afternoons."
,,Simply stunning!,5.0,,"Incredible & mind blowing, a sensational experience in a stunning environment. Totally recommend visiting!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"A real indoor jungle. You can enjoy the waterfalls from one step, and all those flowers that come with a place like this. Go up and leave yourself time enough to walk down. If you ar lucky you can see the humidification, which guarantees the perfect jungle atmosphre"
,,Delightful,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is an unusual and spectacular structure filled with exotic plants. Spend at least 2 hours for a relaxed walk and plenty of photo opportunities.
,,Great building.Look out for the carvings.,4.0,,"Magnificent structure, OK it's not a real waterfall, but really, what would you expect? As an experience it's right up there. However it's best to go when it's not too busy or you will end up waiting for a long time for the lift to the top but we both really enjoyed our visit, walking around the elevated walkways gives interesting views both within the dome and outside. The wooden carvings hidden around make it worth the visit on their own, especially the seat near to the exit and the dragons, the lions face and the old man. Didn't spend time with the stalactites as they were not what we came for but looked interesting but light wasn't good enough for pictures unlike the rest of it.Watch out for the carnivorous Lego.And it's cool, especially when it's hot outside, loads of photo opportunities, and loads of plants, maybe not flowers but interesting plants anyway."
,,Impressive and Extremely Relaxing!,5.0,,"Stepping into the Cloud Forest you are instantly transposed to the most beautiful and relaxing world. The first thing you see is the giant waterfall that is just stunning. You then go up and work your way down the trail to the bottom again.

Along the way you see an entirely beautiful world of plants, trees, and great smells. I found this to be one of the most relaxing times in Singapore. Not only do you have fresh plants everywhere but it is extremely peaceful.

I came here twice while in Singapore and each time was pure bliss. It never gets old walking around seeing this exhibit. A big plus is that this is also indoors and that air conditioning feels pretty great after being outside!

This is definitely a must-do. Every attraction at Gardens By the Bay."
,,Simply a beautiful display of human emulation of nature.,5.0,,The mixture of nature and architecture in this facility is amazing. Optically beautiful and the skywalk is an engineering achievement. My entire family loved everything about this attraction. This attraction is a must if you visit Singapore.

,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"Best tip I can give is arrive here first thing in the morning, the place is practically empty and you can get some great photos. Quite an eye opener, breathtakingly beautiful. September 2017"
,,Great effect of a natural waterfall,4.0,,As soon as you enter you have this awesome sight of water cascading down from a significant height. Lot of foilage around it to give effect of a real waterfall. Walking around the waterfall is a great experience. Fantastic !
,,Great place,4.0,,"Went there during the day, is was amazing. But better come at night time for the light show. You can either take the mrt or taxi to get here. The garden its self is huge.

,,Same as Garden - a Must See,5.0,,"It is very crowded, indeed, but if you have time take a slow walk to the Cloud Forest. And have a look to each corner...."
,,Like walking on a cloud!,5.0,,This place will blow your mind. A monstrous waterfall inside a giant dome with walkways and greenery everywhere. Fairly crowded the day we went but the crowd moved through without problems. Loads of photo spots. Flowers were lovely to look at. The crystals inside the forest were lovely - although the lighting to emphasise them could have been better. Loved the wooden carvings throughout that were sometimes hidden in the foliage. Definitely worth a visit - nice to be in the dome on a hot day as quite cool to walk around.

It has such great vibe, the nature is vibrant and the environment has been developed to show us how our planet is gorgeous and what can be done to reduce our impact on the environment."

,,Beautiful & Cool,5.0,,"Entering the cloud forest, you feel how cold it is inside because of the heat you have been enduring for the last couple of hours. The waterfall is about 2 - 3 storeys high, cascades down a rock wall with lovely plants jutting out along the way down. A suspended walkway takes above with an amazing view down. Some smaller waterfalls, ponds, beautiful garden of orchards & other plants."
,,Great spot to explore and get away from the Singapore humidity,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a great spot to visit, especially when it's hot and humid as it's nice and cool within the conservatory. Have a good look around the open area at entry level before going up to the higher levels in the lift as you can't get back! If you can time your visit arrive just before 10am, 12am or 2pm so that you experience the ""misting"" before going to the top"
,,Man made Vertical Garden,4.0,,"I was fortunate to go there when they held orchid flower festival there.

,,wow,5.0,,"what a beautifully thought up place to visit.Singapore certainly has that wow factor ,although lots of people visiting you certainly had time to stand and reflect what was around you,we could not have been more happy to find this wonderful place to visit,"
,,Utterly breathtaking!,5.0,,"We first visited in early 2013, Gardens by the Bay had only been open for just over 7 months, so we were intrigued to return 6 years later and see how things had progressed. we were delighted to see how much was familiar to us, but also how things had grown.

The Cloud Forest is astonishing, from the moment you walk in and are gently splashed by the tallest indoor waterfall in the world (30 metres). You can wander around at your own pace as you descend through the surreal mist-filled Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk. The views from the top are astonishing, but possibly not for the fainthearted if you don't like heights! It's fantastic to see so many beautiful and exotic plants growing in this amazing space."
,,Amazing gardens singapore,5.0,,"I had four days in Singapore. The Gardens by the Bay have to be seen to believe you can have such amazing selections of trees, flowers from all over the world. It’s a steep walk in places, but there are lifts if you cannot walk so far. The glass bridge is really something. The children around me thought it was fun. I found the waterfall was the most breathtaking, truly a wonderful idea. You may find it rather humid, so take water with you. Take your time, you can sit and rest among the different gardens."
,,Loved the Sky Cloud,5.0,,"We were VERY impressed with the sky cloud, definitely something we'd return to in the future, especially to show friends through, it's a massive set up and would have cost heaps, but worth every dollar!"

,,Amazing display of plants!,5.0,,"Well worth the entry fee to see this fabulous display, even if you are not a garden buff. Beautiful flowers particularly the orchids, lovely walkways with waterfalls and ponds and great rain-forest re-creation that was a real pleasure to wander through."
,,Visit to the cloud dome,5.0,,I really enjoyed visiting the cloud dome The manmade waterfall was outstanding and tbe walk among the clouds was exciting and the displays made for outstanding photos
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Must see!!!

From the first impressions of the waterfall, throughout your walk through... Including the ""misting"" if there cloud forest, you'll enjoy this very special location.

Definitely recommend."
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"If you prefer nature over roller coasters then this is the place. A very nice place where you come close to nature with endless plants, water fall and beautiful flowers. I haven’t seen so many flowers and leaves under the same roof elsewhere.
A must visit place and a different experience"
,,Amazing landscape,4.0,,An indoor forest with largest waterfall. My 2 years son love it so much!! It is air-conditioned and at night can get a little bit cold especially for kids. A MUST-VISIT place if you are in Singapore. The view is amazing !!
,,Large air conditioned greenhouse.,4.0,,I loved this but my teenage son was bored. The waterfall at the entrance is amazing and the layout is great. You take a lift to the very top of the dome and then take walkways round the outside to get back to the bottom. It's air-conditioned inside and is a great way to escape the heat and humidity....just leave the teenagers at home.
,,Out of this world,4.0,,"The cloud forest is worth every minute! Located in the Gardens by the Bay area, it is the worlds largest indoor waterfall with very impressive greenery and design. It made me feel like I was in a scene from the movie Avatar. I would recommend going in the evening or early morning to beat the crowds, also so that you can snag a better picture ;)."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"I loved it! the view of the waterfall takes your breath away right when you enter the dome! it's a bit wet, but it is welcoming since the weather is pretty hot outside. the sight is amazing, and yes you have to stand in the line (sometimes line seems long, but it passes quickly) to ""climb"" up the hill. there are stairs inside of the hill like thing and even a small balcony where one can take a closer look at the waterfall. you will notice the balcony when you enter the venue, since there are lots of tourists like you taking selfies or just photos of the waterfall from the ""balcony"" There is also a bridge where you can walk around the ""hill"" it shakes a bit, so I hope you are not scared of the heights. Otherwise it is completely safe and I would trust Singaporean engineers with my life :) They don't do anything just to click done in the box. Everything is safe and secure."
,,Impressive,5.0,,Pretty impressive. Worth a look if its something you are interested in and won't get the chance to go to Ecuador
,,"Love, love, love",5.0,,Such a beautiful space to spend time in. The waterfall s captivating and the environment is so cool temperature wise - it's a welcome break from the Singapore heat.

Fantastic collection of plants that's well worth a visit."
,,Nice cool place to visit!,4.0,,"Strolling through this air conditioned maze was very pleasant, take the elevator to the “mountain” top and meander down on the walkways, quiet and clean and a great break from the outside heat...definitely recommend!"
,,Best part of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Of the two paying domes, this is the must-do. I usually take the lift to the top and slowly meander my way down.

Then I look up at the mega waterfall and just pause in wonder.

Well worth the ticket price.

For senior folks and those with walking difficulties, pls note the area near the fall can be wet. Be careful!"

Members of the Gardens by the Bay enjoy unlimited entries and free parking"
,,Great experience with family,5.0,,Marvelous architecture and meticulously planned. Good place to spend a couple of hours with family and enjoy the nature!
,,Up in the clouds,5.0,,Absolutely incredible experience of what is like in the real deal. Many can't experience an actual montane cloud forest and this is the solution to get to do it...
,,Serene and lovely man-made forest in the middle of this concrete jungle called Singapore,5.0,,"It's best to know very little before you enter this place (part of the fun is the surprise of looking at it for the first time). Rest assured, the place is worth your time and money."
,,In door garden,5.0,,Well maintained in door garden. If you are in Singapore you should visit it. Truly amazing and worth your time and money
,,Best indoor garden with widest collection of floral,5.0,,"A must go place when in Singapore. The entire Marina Bay Area is simply lovely in tropical Singapore.

,,A cool experience... literally,5.0,,"I always try to bring visiting friends and relatives to this place, and it never disappoints. In Singapore's humid heat, the Cloud Forest provides a cool and refreshing respite. It's like a botanical garden, but with a mountain theme - very educational. And every time I go it seems there's always something different, something new.

Literally a cool place to visit."
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,Don’t miss a visit to these amazing gardens. If you only have time to visit one garden in Singapore this is the most impressive in my opinion. You can easily spend an hour or more exploring the different levels and enjoying the amazing vistas and exotic plants inside.

,,Amazing atmosphere,5.0,,"A must see place if you are in Singapore, it is definitely a tourist stop and gets a little crowded afternoons . So if you want to take good pictures without people you should go early in the morning"
,,Must see when visiting the gardens by the bay!,5.0,,The cloud forest is like nothing I've ever seen before! Beautiful and there are loads of great photo opportunities.
,,Part of the garden bays event,5.0,,Loved this dome- the walk from the top down to the bottom was worth it and stunning waterfall. Be great if there was real wildlife too! Expect lots of folks and some competing for photo opportunities but never felt over crowded or hurried. Bit chilly inside with air con on full- a lovely change from the intense heat outside
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest are a must for any visitors to Singapore. We picked the afternoon to visit so that we could stay in the evening to watch the spectacular lights show in the evening. The Cloud Forest is a must but you do go up quite a height. There is such a variety of exotic plants to see. And then in the evening around 1945hrs there is a spectacular light show to music in the Garden. Just pick a spot just to watch the incredible light show and music, totally mesmerising!"
,,Amazing gardens,5.0,,"I spent an hour wandering around the Dome enjoying the rainforest and waterfall. You catch a lift up the top and slowly wander around the spiral walkway to see and experience the beautiful greenery.

Its a nice escape from the heat outside as its climate controlled for the gardens.

Note: Beware buying tickets on the Zlook app as we got given a childs ticket after paying for an adults buying tickets for the Gardens by the Bay.

Definitely worth experiencing while in Singapore."

,,Fabulous garden and waterfall,5.0,,"Add this to Gardens on the Bay and it is worth every Singapore cent. We took so many photographs - we are so glad phones have taken over from camera rolls, it would have cost us a fortune to develop them all. Must see in Singapore."
,,amazing wow,5.0,,we have both been to the eden project but this is on another level an absolute wonder if in singapore you must visit
,,Fantastic Cooling Place for Hot Burning weather,5.0,,Repeat visits with my father & his maid to enjoy the cooling & misting surrounding in a hot burning afternoon...
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We recommend you include this in your package with the trees,
It is amazing place but not for the faint hearted if you don’t like heights. I hate then but force myself to go and so glad I did, unbelievable walkway through the trees. You don’t have to go on the walkway as there is a path on the ground that you can take to walk around. Would highly recommend."
,,Great and refreshing,5.0,,Amazing what they have built under this roof. It is a must to visit as I havent seen someting comparable. The height and diversity is top
,,Just great,5.0,,"Choosed a period when not so busy (working day, ca 2pm). No waiting for anything. Great experience! Thank you for the Eco Education at the end! For kids, adults, older people: recommended!

,,Cool diversion on a hot day,4.0,,"Cloud forest display highlights a centrally located huge waterfall in the center of the dome. The air-conditioned environment is a nice break from the heat outside. You can take an elevator up to the top and then wind your way down through cloud Forest orchids, ferns and unusual plants. Walkways can be a bit crowded with tour groups, I would allow at least one hour for a leisurely exploration of this venue."
,,Fantastic.,5.0,,"You'll be blown away by this. Put simply, it's amazing. The planting, sculpture's & the worlds highest indoor waterfall will leave you dumb struck."
,,Amazing garden in the sky and underground!!,4.0,,"As soon as you enter the Cloud Forest, you are greeted by a mist of fine water spray from a vertical waterfall, and as you proceed to walk inside, you are overwhelmed by the beauty of exotic plants, flowers and amazing leaves and foliage. The entire walk is in cool comfort as the plants there only thrive in optimal surroundings. You take the lift right up to a very high floor, and proceed to walk to the top, then around the elevated walkways around the structure, admiring the various plant collections as you go. Do not miss out the Secret Garden in the basement."
,,Worth it,5.0,,"I paid the extra money to go in and was glad I did. Inside is beautiful, climbing up to the top is fun and the views are phenomenal. I really enjoyed all of the carved wood sculptures of dragons and animals hidden throughout the garden as well."
,,Incredible Experience,5.0,,"Highly Recommend! Together with the Flower Dome it's not too expensive.

A must-do for any visit to Singapore is this stunning Cloud Forest dome. You start off at the base of the indoor waterfall, but as you're inside its somehow less humid and cooler than the outside world of Singapore.

There's plants, sculptures and cool-random things as you walk round the dome before heading up in the lift to the top where you get great views both of whats inside and outside the dome.

I also appreciate the poignant climate change messages that are spread throughout this dome, it does make you appreciate what we've got."
,,fantastic,5.0,,"so well planned and set out and so cool during the hot humid weather. The waterfall is amazing and the spray cools you down,the orchids are breathtaking"
,,Waterfall!,5.0,,Stunning! Well worth the money. Beautiful and air conditioned. Staff very friendly and helpful. Could not visit singapore without visiting here.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The cloud forest is a temperature controlled dome with a six storey bio forest and waterfall. Once inside an elevator takes you to the top and you gradually work your way down floor by floor until you get to the gift shop. The array of plants and flowers are breath taking. The colours are so vivid and it feels like you're inside a living thing. I highly recommend it.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A place in dream, should come here in the early morning, then you can feel how to walk on lovely clouds that surrounds by amazing forest ""all green"""
,,A PIECE OF PARADISE,5.0,,I was not imagining to be able to visit a place like this... a huge fall welcomes you and then your discover begins....
,,One of the World's tallest indoor Waterfall,5.0,,"The large, climate-controlled dome has spiralling walkways and one of the world’s tallest indoor waterfalls that rains down from over 30 metres above. It's exciting - bring your camera & enjoy."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,What they have done here is awesome. This is a must see when visiting Singapore. The way they have created the waterfall and cloud mist is fantastic.
,,A pleasant garden indoors,4.0,,"As stated above, very nice indoor garden. Loved the fact that the waterfall is a tower full of things to see. Easily accessible with elevators for those in need of one."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Inside the Garden by the Bay, this Dome really has an impact on the visitor. It's cold inside due to the air conditioner. The design for the nature inside is fantastic, the flowers the plants, everything well done. The bridges inside lead you to spaces where you can spot another angle of that constuction and the landscape. Must see!"
,,Interesting,4.0,,This is in a dome in Gardens of the bay.We had purchased tickets in our hotel which was slightly cheaper.Lovely displays of trees and flowers specially orchids.You climb quite high for a view over the forest.It was busy but loads of room for everyone.Worth a visit.
,,Beautiful 🥰,5.0,,"Absolutely loved this place... Especially how cool it was. So much to see, to take in. So many good photo opportunities, bit hard when busy although we managed to get some pretty awesome ones.. definitely worth a visit."
,,Another place to keep coming back to.,5.0,,"I find it hard to explain to people sometimes, exactly what to expect here. The plant life is so variable, ranging from large flowers to minute orchids. You can walk up or down a large spiral walkway, circumnavigating the central ‘mountain’ of plant life. There is so much to see that return visits will always be rewarding."
,,Great Photographic Opportunities,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest includes humid but cooler climate zones that are better suited to some of the more temperate plant species. Great collection of many carnivorous plants (many Pitcher Plant species), along with orchids, and a wide range of other higher-altitude species. The mist generators on the elevated walkways provide a spectacular backdrop, and one can easily spend a large chunk of the day in this one building! Similar to the Flower Dome in some respects, but very different in others - so the two domes are very complementary. Obviously a must-see if visiting Gardens by the Bay!"
,,Spectacular and peaceful,5.0,,"This place is beautiful and worth the admission charge, I loved the indoor waterfall and its a great place to get out the heat for a couple of hours."
,,A day couldn't spent any better,5.0,,"Perfectly organized, perfectly structured. A day perfectly spent.. From the moment you step in till you leave the premises, the floral and the cloud forest amaze you.. its better to start with floral and then move yo cloud forest, then the super trees!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,What a beautiful place to visit when youre in Singapore. I was pleasantly surprised when we visited this place. We weren't sure what to expect but it really was worth visiting. Our pass was for both the Forrest and flower dome and it cost us $22. You could spend anywhere from an hour to 3 hours here. Perfect thing to do to escape the weather!
,,Tips to enjoy this Cloud Forest,5.0,,"We've been here at least five times, and we loved it each time. It contains the tallest man-made indoor waterfall when it was built, that waterfall still stands at about 7-stories high, and what's awesome is that you get to walk INTO and AROUND this waterfall via the sky bridges which kind of wraps around the central waterfall tower. It's a pretty normal building within the waterfall, but if you're into stalactites and stalagmites and similar nature's beautiful formations in caves, you'll find a giant collection in there too. What I personally enjoyed most was the secret garden right down at the bottom, it gets all misty and mysterious especially at night. And of course the climate change video --- great environmental lesson for all.

Since we've been here at different times of the year and day, we noticed a pattern and probably some tips to better this place better:

1. Day to come:
During certain weekends and the obvious public holidays, it gets so crowded that you have to queue just to get ONTO the elevator, which is essential since the tour kinda starts top down. Average of a 15-minute queue. If possible, avoid these days.

2. Time to come:
Another way to avoid the crowds is to come in the evenings. They close at 8.30pm so if you can come at 7pm or later, when most other tourists are out having dinner, you'll almost have a whole fantastic cloud forest to your own AND enjoy the misty, chilly conditions, kind of like in a real dense forest. The musical lights show at Supertree Grove is at 7.45pm or 8.45pm, so you could probably plan you itinerary to match those.

3. Other tips
The elevators only bring you to the 6th floor, and you gotta change to another elevator that brings you to the extreme top. This other elevator makes this place pram/stroller/wheelchair friendly. Also, the ""secret garden"" at the bottom seems a little harder to access to. Make sure you don't miss it after the climate change screening. Look out for the signage that points you there."
,,Wow,5.0,,Totally surprised by how imaginative and magical this place is. You do indeed feel as though you are walking on and in the clouds. Lovely greenery and waterfalls. Very serene and relaxing.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Well worth a visit with great plants and experience. The only downside very busy and need patience and allow plenty of time
,,"Don't worry, there is a lift to the top so you can walk down",5.0,,"Complementing the Flower Dome this is another fantastic, must see venue. Amazing collection of trees etc but also a ""cave"" of minerals which is very well laid out.
Would be useful if labels were also displayed at the higher levels of the walkway. Will go back in a few years to see if they have pruned the Kauri, it is aiming for th3 roof!"
,,Great Place,5.0,,Very beautiful. The waterfall in the cloud forest is simply amazing. Its worth a visit. The walk on the Level 3 is great.
,,An experience of a lifetime,4.0,,"As you enter from the Flower dome into the Cloud forest Dome, the waterfall splashes you with cold spray that cools you.
Thereafter as you climb the tropical forest level by level, you see the beauty of mother nature spread out in front of you.
As you climb, you learn so much.
By the time you complete your tour you feel humbled with the knowledge that you have gained.
There are 9 levels.
I loved the Crystal mountain most.
Never ever miss this experience."
,,Largest indoor waterfall,5.0,,"If you want to escape from Singapore heat, you must visit cloud foreset. After you enter here, you will feel all the heats gone, the splash from the water cools your body. The flowers and design amaze your eyes."
,,It’s fantastic,4.0,,"Really hard review to write because one word sums it all up ,fantastic. It’s a real recommend and a good way to spend some time if the weather is stormy"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay is a lovely place to visit and amongst its attractions, Cloud Forest to me is most stunning.It’s also a cool reprieve from the heat outside.

From here it is a short walk to the marina sands area where you will find the art science museum and of course lots of shopping and restaurants. Nice way to spend the day out.

Highly recommended."
,,A Forest in the Clouds!,5.0,,This should be definitely in your itinerary if you plan to visit Singapore. It is a unique place. The structure is fantastic. And the plants are a riot of colours. Very well planned and nicely maintained. The walkways are fantastic. You simply have to visit this place to experience it. It is better to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes.
,,Inyetesting buy not for those who hate heights,5.0,,"You can catch the lift up to almost the top of the waterfall with a staircase to the very top. There is a viewing platform to look down the waterfall and you can walk round the high level walkways and use the escalators to go to the different levels. Thousands of plants included in the displays including flesh eating.

They must regularly which is a site in itself and adds to the atmosphere."
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,"If you do nothing else in Singapore visit the Cloud Forest located in Gardens by the Bay. Wonder at the largest indoor waterfall in south east Asia,make your way from the top of the dome through exotic plants, marvel at a crystal world then watch the thought provoking film about climate change and not be moved about the damage being done to our beautiful planet. Suitable for all ages and in a nice,cool temperate climate away from the outdoor heat. An amazing structure to while away the time."
,,Very nice but a bit humid ;))),5.0,,"Very nice place to visit, especially in the morning! If one of your concerns is humidity cause your hair gets curly (or something), well... after this place it will :) Just saying, cause for someone it could be important."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"This is an amazing place to visit, and had to be on everyone’s list of not to missed attractions. Easily accessible we arrived at 10am when it was reasonably quiet and spent over an hour wandering around. The environment is wonderful, the plants and trees are fascinating and well presented."
,,Beautiful gardens and a great place to cool off!,4.0,,Makes you feel that you have walked into a tropical paradise. The mountain of plants looks like they have been there forever and the waterfalls complete the picture.
,,Magnificent forest,5.0,,"Cloud dome is a wonderful forest environment in a huge dome structure.

The temperature is cool, great after Singapore heat.

As you enter make your way through to the lifts and go the level 7. Then follow the various ramps and paths, escalators back to the bottom.

Lots of photo opportunities but the photos don’t do it justice.

We paid half price for tickets. Search internet, we used Vidi which was linked to Airasia."
,,Visit at night,5.0,,Sounds of croaking frogs and trees illuminated and covered in foliage. Like scenery from the film Avatar
,,Jungle Feeling,5.0,,Make sure you be there when they start the misting. You will get a lot of good photos that are looking like screenshots from the Jurassic Park
,,Interesting.,3.0,,"Very interesting place, great for those who love nature especially plants. It is nice and cool inside and the waterfall is beautiful but it gets a little tedious to walk around, it is fantastic that they have implemented the gardens into the city but the cloud forest is not somewhere you would spend a lot of time at my age. I was 23."
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,The habitats that have been created here are incredible and the design and layout is first class. Well worth visiting!
,,A must visit.,5.0,,"Yes, the upfront entry$ might seem a bit much, but it is well worth every penny and you will understand why once you see the upkeep requirements and displays. Super clean and maintained. The eco/bio-spheres/dome[s] and gardens are fantastic even for those who can't raise a house plant! Guaranteed to please, even children with the waterfalls and walkways and displays or sculptures. Easy/recommended to get there by the MRT. A great walk even in the heat and once inside the domes, you are instantly cooled and entranced with the experience. Plan on 3 hours minimum to visit."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,Is really amazing that in Singapore they can do this kind of nature place feel good when u look at nature taking over with the water droplets sound who love the nature they could come and see this amazing place I believe they take a good shot photo for Instagramer. I love it
,,Marvelous structure...a must visit,5.0,,"its beautiful, its magnificent and its worth the visit. my best pictures are of cloud forest. takes you to a different world. make sure you wear non slippery shoes."

,,Excellent!,5.0,,"The cloud dome is pretty stunning, with a waterfall from ceiling to floor. You travel up to the top of this in your managed roam through the dome, with the temperate heating making you feel as though you are climbing a mountain!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The cloud forest is located in one of the glass domes in the Gardens by the Bay, the water fall and the walkways are excellent"
,,A must do experince,5.0,,"This is our second trip to Singapore. The first time we went through the park but didn't take in the cloud forest as we didn't have time. We made sure we experienced them this time around.

We went on a weekday so it wasn't too busy. It certainly is a nice repreave from the heat to be able to spend a few hours inside the wonderfully aircooled cloud forest

The cloud forest was amazing. It is nicely laid out in that you take the elevator to the top and then work your way down through the different areas."
,,Real feel you reach in a rain forest hill station,5.0,,There is only 2 or 3 shows in the evening so do not miss it. Get exact time and try not to miss. You can go to the top by lift or escalator. You can take your baby in his stroller. It will also give you a nice view of outside including Singapore flyer and Marina bay sands.
,,nice to see but not special,2.0,,"Just for Flip Flop Forrest People. Very artificial. For free it's nice, but for the Money paied it was just a installation and not very much impressing."
,,A nice experience even if you take the free option,4.0,,"No drama, just went there took lots of photos and enjoyed the light show from the ground. A very nice time of year to sit in the evening and soak in the atmosphere ."
,,Bake your cake and eat it too,5.0,,"Enjoy the flowers and foliage within the comfort of air conditioning. The crowd is regulated, and you dont usually have to wait more than 10 min to get in.

ENTERING at 6:30 pm. is the best time to get in, just as the sun sets, and just in time to get out for the Supertree Light show."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"It is amazing the work that has gone into this place. If you enjoy plants it is a must. So well maintained, colourful with amazing waterfalls."
,,The highlight of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Don’t leave Gardens by the Bay without seeing the Cloud Forest, which charges for tickets. Worth every penny. Unbelievable gardens where you should spend your time even if just passing through Singapore. Felt like I was in another world, like Avatar’s Pandora, surrounded by plants I’ve never seen before. Absolutely marvelous. Be mindful that the air conditioning is cranked high and could be chilly inside the domes."
,,Disgusting and ugly,1.0,,"This is the most disgusting and ugly place I have ever seen in my life: I did not like nothing about this place. Actually the area with the stalagmites and stalactites that they have removed from various caves made me furious and angry. What was made by nature in millions of years HOW DARE YOU TO CUT AND PUT IT YOUR DOME??? very disappointed in humankind once more, sacrificing everything for money. My personal opinion is to avoid giving money to this place."
,,Hanging Gardens of Singapore!,4.0,,"Awesome architecture combined with nature. Nothing short of amazing! Make sure you go to the top! Be warned though, not for those with altophobia! 😐😐😐"
,,Avatar,4.0,,"Surreal and out of the world feeling inside an air conditioned dome with man-made cascading waterfall within. Part of a pair of conservatories, entrance fee are required. Cheaper to get a ticket for two conservatories, but in truth, you will probably only cover one conservatory depending on your schedule. Cloud Forest dome is the smaller of the two, but make up for it with its surreal Utopia theme, cool mist, green vegetation and majestic avatar like waterfall."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"A must see attraction, it is very well done, and the walks inside are stunning, the waterfall is fabulous."
,,#NatureAwareness2,5.0,,"Just like Garden by the bay, the remains, and videos that can be seen in this place remind me of how to value the natural resources that we have for the future generation."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the Bay and shows very clearly how changes in the climate affects the plant life in our forests.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Loved the experience - so enjoyable and relaxing. The place was so well put together and if you like gardens then you'll love this
,,Amazing,5.0,,"So lush, a bit humid but not too hot. Stay for the regular misting, and make sure you get to the top and walk your way down"
,,Great Elevated Walkway,4.0,,"When you enter the cloud forest there is an impressive waterfall that sprays a water mist over you if you get too close.
Some amazing types of forest plants to see as you make your way round.
The elevated walkways are very impressive and are a great feat of engineering.
There is a fossil deck where you can learn about the different types of fossils.
There are ample toilet facilities and a large gift shop as you exit the forest."
,,cool place!!,4.0,,It is refreshing to be there especially after walking around outside with hot air. Maintenance of this place is amazing. It is beautiful to see all the flowers and plants everywhere right next to you.It is a good place to see the nature in the city. I wish there were not so many people around though.
,,Great,4.0,,Worth visiting as a tourist a lovely break from the heat Probably only need to visit once but the waterfall and growth around it is pretty cool
,,Spectacular gardens and waterfall,5.0,,"Right next to the Flower Dome, its a great (and cool) way to see the plants of the forest. Orchids, carnivorous plans etc. There's a lift to the top of the waterfall and you walk down and around the central ""hill"". A Must see."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Very beautiful and maintained. Lots of different varieties of plants to look at , different floors to see ."

,,1 of a kind,5.0,,"This was our 1st visit and we were blown away by the majestic waterfall from the 1st entrance to the rain forrest. This facility provide a lot of learning even for an adult.

Make sure you booked online before hand for a better entrance fee offer"
,,Huge place,5.0,,Very intresting and amazing place. Easy to go by metro to Marina Bay sands/ Harbourfront station and walk from there. Beautiful place also by evening.
,,Engage with the surroundings,5.0,,"You pay to get into the cloud forest but good experience. Dont expect to be blown away with what you see but if you take your time to read and learn it is a good place to visit. We missed the ""misting"" times at 12,2 and 4pm. Ah well!"
,,Loved being in this dome,5.0,,So much life and learning. The plants and the scenery were gorgeous. Had a fantastic time walking and learning
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,It has an amazing cloud forest with the highest indoor waterfall in the world. Great for photography

,,The Highlight of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,This immersive rain forest experience was by far and away the highlight of my visit to Gardens by the Bay.
,,Wow breathtaking!!!,5.0,,"The cloud dome with its gorgeous rainforest n spectacular waterfall was such a highlight from the gardens of the bay, the walking platform from the top all the way down through the beautiful gardens n outside scenery was just magic, this is a must while visiting Singapore!!"
,,Wow,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay this is the more spectacular of the two buildings, with a huge waterfall (approx. 30 metres I was told) and a skywalk which lets you admire the plants from all angles. A phantastic experience!"
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"This is such a relaxing and beautiful place to visit. Entrance is not that expensive, and if you are visiting the gardens you have to visit cloud forest as well. It will surprise you."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Stunning! A must see on your visit to Singapore. A lovely cool and relaxing environment to spend a few hours and enjoy these stunning gardens. Great value.
,,Awesome watch...!!,4.0,,visit this attraction with flower dome. start with cloud forest which takes 1-1.30 hrs and must see place. we did it in the afternoon as the temperature is cool inside and outside very hot. skywalk and waterfall was center of attraction.
,,WOW STUNNING a must to do,5.0,,"I loved visiting this beautiful garden. Very well presented and was lovely and cool inside. So many beautiful plants and the layout was awesome. LOVED IT. Loved looking down from the top and seeing all the plants and water fall. Whoever designed this attraction did a fantastic job. I was very impressed.
We stayed at Marina Bay Sands and we had the garden view from our room. Was lovely to look at . A must to see when coming to Singapore."
,,Uniquely attractive,5.0,,"While we didn't have too much interest in seeing the vegetation at varied altitudes that the cloud forest tries to show, but the overall concept was uniquely attractive to me. A big mountain of forest with waterfalls and varying degree of temperature to be built within an enclosed dome was amazing to see."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We visited this attraction together with the Flower Dome next door. For me it was much more interesting than the latter, with its sky walk and waterfall. Also, the construction of the dome itself is an engineering marvel."
,,Absolutely mesmerizing!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest dome is aboulutely stunning and can’t be missed. If you are limited on time in Singapore or you have a whole day to explore, The Cloud Forest and Gardens by the Bay will surely not disappoint. Every visit to Singapore I allot time to come here to admire the waterfall and the diverse plant life. In fact the Cloud Forest has become my all time favorite spot in the city."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A wonder and terrific garden, a must visit at the Gardens by the bay. Can be busy and a lot cooler than the outside areas."
,,So beautiful,4.0,,This is a fantastic place to visit. It’s great for people of all ages. The plants and the way it has been designed is amazing. Very relaxing place to just walk around and take it all in. This is a must do if you are in Singapore.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Beautiful waterfall under the dome and orchids from all over the world. This is not to be missed. The whole Gardens by the Bay are breathtaking and an engineering marble.
,,Dychberúce/breathtaking,5.0,,"Pozoruhodná atrakcia v meste orchideí. Tento les pod kupolou, je niečo, čo inde neuvidíte. Majestátna hora s vodopádmi a krásnymi kvetmi.
A remarkable attraction in the city of orchids. This forest below the dome is something you won't see elsewhere. Majestic mountain with waterfalls and beautiful flowers."
,,Food for thought,5.0,,"This comprehensive exhibition make you fulle aware of the effects of global warming and our responsibility towards it. The waterfall is impressive and so the orchards. It is a very interesting design how you proceed through the display without noticing it.
Make time to only see this at the Gardens of the Bay if you have litle time."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,So lovely - stunning - like jurassic park the plants are fantastic - walk way is stunning too very well organised and planned
,,A must,5.0,,"I had read that it is advisable to arrive early for ""the"" photo opportunity where you are able to take picture uninterrupted. We did and glad we did too. At the back there is an escalator that takes you to the top and you are then able to walk down through the forest. Very enjoyable, beautiful picture opportunities and although we didnt experience the heat, I can imagine this would be perfect to escape into."
,,Its cool (literally),4.0,,"Good place to escape the oppressive heat during the day. If you visit during the off peak hours, you can just sit freely among the green and enjoy yr mobile music or video. Better to tour this as part of exploring the Gardens by the Bay. For seniors, the Cloud Forest is cooling, easy to stroll as it is not vast but some parts near waterfall can be slippery so rubber slippers are not so suitable. Very family friendly in general."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Although the gardens and light show are free there is a small charge to walk along the cloud forest but well worth it . Not to be missed .
,,Pretty out of this world and imagination,5.0,,I really was not excited about going to garden by the bay as much. But Cloud forest really blew my mind. The whole built of it is absolutely stunning. The whole walk through it so memorable. And it's in AC!
,,boring,2.0,,"Very crowded and nothing spectacular especially if you come from the tropics. There was a looooong line going to the top, and kids were unruly. Only worthy of 1 visit. Not coming back."
,,amazing and beautiful,5.0,,It will take you 3-4 hours if you want to see all details and flowers in this park ! the variety of plants is impressive
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Another must do if you are near the gardens. So many amazing plants and flowers. The indoor waterfall and sky walkways are just amazing. Don’t miss this one!
,,Beautiful work of engineering,5.0,,"Cloud forest truly shows how you can engineer something to be so beautiful and educational at the same time. My favourite parts are the hanging bridges where you can walk around the artificial waterfall, about 20-30 meters above the ground. It just looks stunning.

P.S. when you are buying tickets, if you are Singaporean or just live in Singapore (EP/SP pass holder), make sure to mention this at the ticket counter and they’ll give you a nice discount on all tickets that you are buying (no matter if your friends/family are not living in Singapore)"
,,Good for comfortable walks,5.0,,The air-conditioned interior is great for a slow walk on hot days. Avoid weekends where the elevator gets overcrowded and you have to walk up 7 storeys instead of waiting 30mins for the elevator.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Great place to visit and see the grand scale of this man made indoor forest, the building itself is awesome to. Its an easy walk up and you sort of walk in a spiral to the top first and then you'll again in a spiral motion to come back down. Coming down you'll walk in sections on hanging platforms it can be a bit scary in places if your a bit worried of heights, but well worth the look just to take in the views and how well thought through this place really is. It gets really busy here so i would recommend going early. Definitely check it out"
,,Part of the Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Best bit of the gardens by the bay, truly astonishing engineering! Cleverly routed path takes you to the top in a lift then you wander down through the jungle."
,,A unique experience,5.0,,Worth your time even if it's the only place you visit while in Singapore. There is no other similar within South East Asia.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Although the main gardens are free the S$28 charge for entry to the two domes are good value. Hats off to the design team for this truly amazing eco system in the heart of the city
,,A great visit to indoors nature,5.0,,"This site is built of two large ""greenhouses"" that contain many plants. Everything is climate controlled, and very comfortable, as compared to the outside. A most interesting opportunity to see and learn about so many plants, climb an artificial ""mountain"" that simulates a rain forest at various elevations, including mist ejection to represent an artificial cloudy area."
,,Another must do,5.0,,"We was at the the gardens so you must do the domes they are just amazing the amount of planting and types is just fantastic, dont rush."
,,Don't Miss This!,5.0,,"I wrote about this in the Gardens by the Bay category, but this is my favorite as far as the whole Gardens by the Bay area is concerned."
,,Unique attraction in Singapore for all mature lovers,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest is definitely worthy of a visit while in Singapore. It comprises of a man made tropical mountain with massive waterfall cascading down it. You feel like you are walking with nature after taking the lift to the top & winding your way down walking through the lush greenery. Also a great place to cool down as it is air conditioned."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Stunning architecture, amazing man-made tropical mountain, a not-to-be-missed attraction in Singapore. Absolutely worth visiting!"
,,Perfect for Hot Day,5.0,,"Beat the heat and enjoy an hour or so in the Cloud Forest. Beautiful! But be aware that this is a tourist attractions - so LARGE groups and people ""pushing"" is to be expected."

,,Must visit place,5.0,,Must visit place. Need to fees for enter. Very amazing. Man made nature make u to feel surreal. Cold and shivering just like any natural forest under open sky.
,,One of the tallest indoor man-made water fall,4.0,,"A world of trees and plants with one of the biggest indoor man made waterfall greeting you as you enter the Cloud Forest. Learn about the different plants and trees as you walk down the hanging walkway enjoying the amazing views.
Try to time your visit towards the dusk."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We visited this place but since I am scared of heights, it's only my husband who went all the way up. It's good for photo ops and also to see the orchids on the first floor"
,,Beautiful water falls.,5.0,,"Having visited Eden Project in Cornwall, England we felt a bit underwhelmed by it all . But , it is unique in its own way and therefore would certainly advise visiting it even if you have visited similar projects elsewhere."
,,More is more in this beautiful and surreal place,5.0,,"The massive waterfall entrance is shamelessly aiming for the wow factor – and it absolutely works. Cloud Forest is an over-the-top, sci-fi greenhouse that’ll have you walking around and through the massive plant-covered “mountain” and crossing twisting walkways with dizzying views. The setting’s artificial of course, and yet it makes you appreciate nature in all its glory. Totally worth a visit."
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,"Located in Gardens in the Bay, the Cloud Forest is a tropical garden with the worlds tallest indoor waterfall. Take the lift to the top and start your descent viewing amazing plants and exhibits as you descend. The 28 dollar entry fee gives you access to both the Cloud Forest and the next door Flower Dome."
,,Don’t miss the Misting,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is located at the Garden by the Bay. There were so many different species of flowers and plants to see. The misting of the orchids occur at set times .. be sure to be there and watch – it certainly cools you down from Singapore’s tropical weather.

,,Stunning & Breathtaking!!,5.0,,Cloud Forest is located in Gardens by the Bay. It is a must see place in Singapore. the entry fee $28 gives entry to the Flower Dome as well. It is the best tropical garden shrouding the world's tallest indoor waterfall that you will ever see. it's worth every penny. Don't forget to visit to the giant trees. This place is absolutely breathtaking.
,,Very refreshing landscape,5.0,,a must go place to learn about cool landscape. Start from top by lift and walk down to the ground floor seeing each exhibits and plants .
,,Fountain and Flora it is spectacular,4.0,,You start off at the fountain and casually walk up to the point where you take the lift to the top then it is onto the skywalk to bring you back down. We went at night and it was very beautiful with the fountain bathed in purple.
,,A must see,5.0,,A must see if in Singapore this is an amazing space so much in the space. You can spend an hour in this dome alone.
,,Simply The Most Amazing Indoor Garden You Have Ever Seen,5.0,,A massive waterfall greets you upon entry and you feel the temperature drop fifteen degrees. It only gets better from there. Check it out!
,,Second Dome At gardens by the bay,4.0,,Of the two dooms this is perhaps my favorite only because of the number of different types of orchids on display. The waterfall is purportedly the largest indoor waterfall.
,,Great!,5.0,,"Wonderful place to visit. Expensive and crowded, but it's worth every penny, particularly if you come in the late afternoon, before a visit to the giant trees. Both children an parents loved it. Flower dome is far less interesting."
,,This place is breathtaking,5.0,,Words or pics cannot describe how beautiful and interesting this place is. It has to be experienced to be fully appreciated.
,,"Technically, the coolest place in Singapore!",5.0,,One of the best attractions of Singapore the cloud garden is one amazing man made masterpiece and a must visit for everyone visiting Singapore. The cool atmosphere inside the glass dome doesn't make you feel as if you're in Singapore.
,,The best tropical garden ever,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is within the Gardens by the Bay. It cost to enter but the entry fee $28 gives entry to the Flower Dome as well. Worth every cent as it is the best display of plants I have ever seen. Takes a few hours just to take in all that the Cloud Forest has to offer.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,What an amazing experience we had in the cloud forest you feel like your actually in the rain forest the effects are spectacular.
,,Spectacular Cloud adventure!,5.0,,"This is a world-class botanic garden! Simply spectacular! Not to be missed! Fun to explore, spectacular to photograph!"
,,Unique Place,5.0,,"The experience there is unique, I have never been to such a place, a must go. The atmosphere is most relaxing."
,,Wonderful visit,5.0,,"An amazing place. You feel as though you are, for example, in the amazon rain forrest. The flora and fauna are magnificent and the effects spectacular."
,,Tourist on my 2nd home,5.0,,"I always passed by the dome whenever i do my cycling on weekends, but never had a chance to explore it inside, until last Jan2019 after being in Spain for more than 6 months. A chance you wouldn't pass on, love every part of it, every leaf, flower & that forest feeling...
I would definitely visit it again."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"The size and scope of the architecture is amazing. The plants, flowers and greenery is everywhere, in well designed and natural setting"
,,Amazing attraction,5.0,,"Absolutely fantastic, I bought a joint ticket for this and the flower dome.
On entry you're met by a long drop waterfall, the misty air hits you straight away.
Take a lift to the top and follow the walkway down taking it all in.
Its like a rain forest mountain with the vegetation, flowers and plants changing as you descend, as you expect in a rain forest.
Well worth the visit"
,,WOW,5.0,,The way the have created a atmosphere within the premises is just spectacular. This place is very informative for kids to actually be able to get educated on the effects of global warming and other factors which are destroying the earth!
,,A Cool Rainforest within a Biosphere!,5.0,,"Wow! This was cool to see. When you first arrive into the dome you are confronted by a four story waterfall & mist and cooling fog! AMAZING to see! The building is an architectural wonder all by itself! The whole place is a photographers dream come true to visit. The pathways, flowers, props and greenery are breathtaking! You will think your are in an Amazon rain-forest the whole time you are here (without the humility & sweating). An elevator takes you to the top of the waterfall mountain and you then begin walking on an amazing walkway in the sky down to the lower level.

BOTTOM LINE: You will love seeing this incredible rain-forest biosphere. I can praise the designers enough for making such an amazing facility. MUST SEE! Put this place on your priority list when visiting Singapore! Be sure to visiting all the gardens here, inside and out!. MY RATING: 10/10"
,,Nice bur better buy your tickets at the entrance,4.0,,"We thaught we are smart when buying the Tickets for cloud Forest, flower dome and the ocbc skywalk in advance in the internet at the gardens by the bay Website. As we wanted to ""skip the line"" we klicked the link for the tickets and got forwarded to headout.com and bought the Tickets.... thats what we thaught. So at dawn we went to the entrance and showed them the ticket. They told us its not the final Ticket, we have to go to the lobby of marina bay sands, what was a very long walk after walking through singapore the whole day. Also in the lobby it took a lot of Time to find the right desk to pick up the Tickets. Back at the gardens there was just enough time to run through cloud forest and spend some time at the skywalk. We didnt have enough time for the flowerdome, when we tried the next day, they told us the Tickets are expired.... it was a nice evening, but we really think its better to wait a few minutes in the qeue...."
,,Paradise in the city...,5.0,,"Complete with waterfall, exotic flowers and plants. The place will give you at least an hour of pleasure, either you’re a nature lover or just want to take selfie. Great attraction overall...wheelchair accessible too."
,,Amazed with indoor waterfall,5.0,,"I visited could forest at night in garden by the bay area. It was first time visit eco park with indoor waterfall. Lucky me I was there in the time of fog show too. I felt like in real forest ^^
Oh dont forget to bring jacket if you want to come here because temperature was a little cold inside. Bring water it must. And last enjoy the moment and fresh air there with your lovely family, friends or someone special."
,,man's ability to create at its best !!!!!,5.0,,"1 of the 2 glass domes at gardens by the bay. at the entrance a 115 ft waterfall transports you to an another world which seems magical. it recreates the feeling of touring altitudes between 3000 to 11000 ft. the mist recreated by the waterfall as it settles on your skin when you enter the dome feels heavenly.
the efforts of actually imagining and executing the creation of this dome and the recreation of the conditions on tropical mountain tops is actually unbelievable.
this has to be one the best man made wonders.
the cloud mountain being accessible through elevators and then descent through a circular route using escalators. all flora fauns like orchids, anthuriums, ferns , grass etc does seem like you are in a magical illusionary world where time has come to a standstill. all levels have a differently themed garden,
you certainly cannot decide which is the best of the lot, lost world,cavern,waterfall view,crystal mountain gallery, theatre or the secret garden.
allow yourself atleast a couple of hours to enjoy this cloud forest."
,,Best attraction,5.0,,"Wonderful arrangement and beautiful plants in abundance, well worth the entry fee, and highly recommended."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Such a delight. The Cloud Forest light and music event happens at 7.45 and 8.45. We went up one of the ‘trees’ to the rooftop bar. $20 singapore for entry and a drink but worth it to see Singapore from the sky at night.
,,"Simply beautiful, stunning and out of the world imagination !!!",5.0,,"Cloud forest is one of the 2 massive glass greenhouses inside Gardens by the Bay. The place is stunningly beautiful. The moment we entered the dome area we were transported in to a magical world !!! There is a huge waterfall right at the entrance and it sprinkles fresh water on every visitor. The imagination and execution behind creating this dome is just awesome. One has to actually be there to believe it.

The cloud forest dome has replicated the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions between 3000 ft and 10,000 ft above sea level across the South-East Asia and South America. It features a huge ""Cloud Mountain"" which is accessible using an elevator. We then descended the mountain using a circular path where a massive 115 ft waterfall provides refreshing cool air and lovely feel to the place.

The Cloud Mountain itself is an intricate structure completely with a lot of flora n fauna such as orchids, ferns, peacock ferns, antheriums, etc. It has a number of levels, each with a different theme like the Lost World, the Cavern, Waterfall View, Crystal Mountain, Cloud Forest Gallery, Cloud Forest Theatre and Secret Garden.

We spent nearly half a day here and still our desire to spend more time was not satiated !!!! One of the best man made natural wonder !!!"

,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must visit and a more engaging experience than a walk at the Botanic Gardens (Orchid Garden at Botanic Gardens is fabulous however can be covered quickly).

I recommend a visit later afternoon around 4-5 pm before sunset for daylight views and then the gorgeous night illumination for nighttime walk. Enjoy!"
,,Only one thing missing,5.0,,Great set up with real clouds everywhere. Having visited cloud forests in Costa Rica we enjoyed the humming birds and to see Birdlife in Singapore is not easy. Besides that a great experience!

Every inch is covered with well-maintained flower/plants and after every short interval there's mist-release which really does makes you feel like you are on clouds. Not to forget the waterfall."
,,Fascinating place for plant lovers,5.0,,This is worth the cost to walk through this HUGE arboretum. Also a little cooler place to get out of the heat.
,,Cloud Forest and Flower Conservatories,5.0,,"We were amazed by the vast variety of trees and flowers in both conservatories and one must see both of them. Even children will ask questions of what Global Warming is and it will have to be their generation to help continue to save our forests and animal species from extinction. I, for one, will put up solar panels this year to help lessen Greenhouse Effects from Energy usage...MDSPOCK"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Not to be missed together with the Flower Dome. Magnificent displays of flowers, ferns and other vegetation in a tropical rain forest environment.

The cloud forest is amazing. Cover your little one a bit as it is a bit cold for little ones. It's like going close to a real waterfall... such an amazing experience.

It's beautifully done up. Just nothing short of a magical experience... loved it here and will visit again soon!"

,,A Marvel of Nature,4.0,,"Really beautiful but you tend to get wet upon entering because of the falls. For those who have a fear of heights, like me, there are some parts that may make you feel a bit woozy but still everything inside was a gorgeous treat. It is like you're not in the city at all."
,,Very impressive! Worth of bisiting.,4.0,,"Together with the sky walk in the Gardens by the bay, it is a must of visiting in Singapore. Not only the indoors waterfall, but the whole arrangement is worth the experience!"

,,Cool garden,4.0,,"This was a cool experience. The flower dome was more appealing and beautiful to me, but the waterfall and the walkways in the cloud forest were interesting"
,,Amazing Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Located at Gardens by the bay, Cloud forest is a simulation of a forest environment inside a green house dome. The attraction is located besides the Flower Garden. At the entrance to the dome, one is greeted by a lager waterfall structure, free flowing and sprinkling water , creating a wonderful natural environment of a moist rainforest environment. There are designated areas inside the dome which house different forest plants. An elevator takes tourists to the top of central mountain like structure and there is a pathway which spirals down from the top to the bottom which passes though numerous plant and flora enclosures and providing glimpses of surrounding city area as well.
The attraction is well maintained and simulates a great natural forest environment. Wonderful experience !!"
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,"What an amazing dome. This is ful of art & decor plants made into features. Its very damp, musky & slightly wet inside. The dome is air on inside & you will be cool.

When you come down you will ser a secret garden.
Suitable for all ages, great pictures & background scenery."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"It is well laid out and some lovely plants inside. A great way to escape the heat. Where I have been to a real Cloud Forest it wasn""t that exciting."
,,Light show,5.0,,"The cloud forest has to be seen at night to really appreciate it. Make sure you attend when the light and sound show is on, out of this world."
,,The waterfall was amazing!,5.0,,"Cloud Forest lived up to the hype. There were plenty of beautiful flowers with great educational information. The day we visited the place, it was about 35 degrees outside but the place was cool inside mainly due to the waterfall which was a nice change. This shouldn't take more than an hour to complete."
,,Interesting Attraction,5.0,,Really cool place in Singapore to visit. A man-made wonder. Can get crowded though. Best viewed after the sun sets.
,,Almost a Tourist Rip-Off,2.0,,This place is more interesting than the Flower Dome by a tad. There is a man-made waterfall and some flora to admire. The best part of this place is the cloud walk and the AC. Take a lift up and walk down the bridge.
,,A NICE AND UNUSUAL WALK,4.0,,"The cloud forest walk is lovely, easy to walk and interesting quite dynamic However I felt that the entry fee with the Gardens on the Bay is quite expensive"
,,Nicely built artificial waterfall,4.0,,Really nice waterfall in cloud forest.it takes around 30 mins to cover entire cloud forest.Must see in gardens by the bay
,,"Interesting, relaxing, beautiful place.",4.0,,"This is a rare chance to experience an artificial cloud forest. They don't do things by halves in Singapore, and here they have created a mountain, inside a dome. The waterfall and mist add to the ethereal charm. The planting is spectacular. Fabulous."
,,Refreshing and fun,5.0,,"So I went to the Cloud Forest, which has a great indoor waterfall. BUT the CF also has an exhibit of the carnivorous plants above on the top floor, and they were copies of plants like Venus Fly traps and they were made by LEGOS!!!! It was great. They also had little sculptures, and other large artwork around the building.

The walk around was very refreshing and it's cooler and more comfortable inside, even with a large crowd. As you walk around the walkways and in and out of the inside areas there are wood sculptures that are exquisite and you wonder how they were made - out of driftwood, but with animals and people coming out of them, or benches carved into animal heads at the end. Creative and impressive.

The flowers and the walk were the right move at a warm, sunny part of the day, and it was fun as well. Go. Enjoy."
,,Mesmerizing view,5.0,,"The best part of Singapore , i havent seen anything like this . Its a well maintained climate controlled garden and very beautifully designed"
,,Fun thing to do and nice to get out of the heat!,4.0,,"This was a good 90 minute activity, very cool inside. Would recommend if you have time and spare money! Also get a discount if you are travelling with Singapore airlines in your transit so make sure to take your ticket!"
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"It´s worth to buy a visit to Cloud Forest and Flower Dome for 28 $ SGD. Biggest installation full of life, plants, flowers and colours."
,,just go! it's a gem.,5.0,,It's amazing what man made structures can contain. Controlled nature spaces like these are an amazing way to conserve some rare species.
,,Impressive!,5.0,,We went to the Cloud Forest dome late afternoon and just had time to squeeze in a visit to the Flower dome too before it closed at 9pm (last entry at 8pm). We'd only intended to visit the Cloud Forest dome and were disappointed to discover that you could only buy combined tickets. Both domes were worth visiting but the Cloud Forest was the more interesting one.
,,Waterfall and learning,5.0,,Did this at the same time as the flower dome. Very interesting to see how the temperature changed in the different levels. Lots of walking but enjoyable.
,,Indoor Waterfall?,4.0,,"This is worth a visit. The misty effect created by the water feature in an air-conditioned environment, with a assorted plants, places one in a nice very urban cave."
,,Best thing to do!,5.0,,We really enjoyed this Dome. A very well designed area . Easy to walk through. Loved the water fall! Was an easy walk from our hotel. Visited the garden Dome too which was good also.
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"Located in Gardens by the Bay, this is a unique experience. Take the elevator up to the top of the waterfall and slowly walk down through the recreated Cloud Forest. Learn about the flora & fauna & conservation along the way. In the second glass structure is a lovely flower garden - be sure to buy an entrance ticket for both."
,,Amazing Man made Marvel,5.0,,The cloud forest is a must visit when in Singapore. You can buy your tickets online in combination with the Flower dome..Accesible by the train at bay station. The cloud forest has a waterfall and a skywalk along the dome. Lots of plant and flower species.
,,Very green,3.0,,"Very well set out, the walkways are really nice & give a relaxing view of the lush greenery. Was a bit too green for me, I prefer a bit more colour, but was very nice for an hours wander."
,,Fabuloud,5.0,,Well worth paying for this..It is popular to go when they do the misting but I did not and it was lovely.
,,If you go there you can see illuminated trees.,5.0,,"When it gets dark, the lights were lit with music. The lights are lit at 7:45 and 8:15(?). I watched the light show lying on the lawn."
,,A must to visit,5.0,,"This is one of the very unique garden you must visit if you are in Singapore. It covered, air con with thousand of plants, rare or hardly seen in this region. Beside it, is the flower Dome which is on display now, the ""ORCHIDS OF THE ANDES"", so do allocate at least half a day for this special experience."
,,Nice Waterfall,5.0,,The waterfall is spectacular!! We spent the afternoon walking around the beautiful gardens. It's a Must see.
,,Amazing place of interest,5.0,,A great place to visit with family or friends meeting together. Air conditioned place and super clean garden. No ants found in the gardsn. Staffs are friendly to show around and queue was short if tickets was purchased online.
,,Great escape from the bustling city into the lush rain forest,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my visit of the rain forest. First of all, it is a great way to get some cool air after walking around the city in the hot weather. The atmosphere with the sounds of the waterfall and all the different scents is incredible. Almost like being in a cloud forest. You follow a signed path and are able to learn a lot about the cloud forest and its vegetation. When I was there, there were quite a few school groups there (it was on a weekday in the late morning), so it was kind of lively at some points. But you can always find some spots that are quieter and enjoy the atmosphere."
,,Experience a forest without getting sweaty!,4.0,,Temperature controlled experience in one of the iconic buildings of Singapore. The waterfall is a sight to behold.
,,Great place with knowledge on vegetation.,3.0,,If u want to see how artificial environment can be created for vegetation..then this is the place...each level has different environments and different level of species with an artificial waterfall.. beautiful they have fixed timings for a mist show so make sure that you go during that duration.
,,Flower Dome and Cloud Forest,5.0,,"It is well worth the time and cost to visit. A lot of good information, numerous photo ops and you can even get lunch or a snack. A highlight of our trip to Singapore."
,,This you have to see yourself!,5.0,,"Amazing. If you visit Singapore, you must visit the Gardens by the Bay. And if you visit the Gardens, you must visit the Cloud Forest."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Air conditioned naturesh greenish lushy greens area. A place to drop by and enjoy all the kinds of plants. I was enjoying my stay in SG
,,"""Coolest Place to be on a Hot Singapore Day""",5.0,,"""Just Awesome"" that's one way of putting it's effect. The dome is so cool, you are welcomed with a waterfall right when you enter. My toddler enjoyed a lot. A must visit to get away from the scorching sun."
,,Wow,5.0,,One of the best parks I have been to in my life.Cant fault the place.I would get the transportation up and walk back next time.We saw both waterfall and flower dome.My son slept to the gentle sound of water.Then watched the bohemian rhapsody light show at night.Must do!
,,One of the few human-build places that had complete wow effect of me,5.0,,"Such a cool place to visit. Excellent to cool off from hot weather outside, and also to see something really nice. The waterfall was beautiful and it was creating a nice mist. A lot of great places to take photos, especially those up at the floors. Much better than flower dome, but maybe I'm just not such flower fan.
If you go to the dome later in the evning when it's getting a little dark, you can enjoy playful decorations made out of led lights."
,,Cool Place on a Hot Day!,5.0,,If you are looking for a nice cool place to visit on a hot Singapore day the Cloud Forest would be a good choice. Actually liked the Flower Dome even better (one ticket gets you both domes) but the waterfall and the rest of the garden was quite nice.
,,Such a beautiful feature - a must!,5.0,,"My husband came across the cloud forest and I wasn’t sure what to expect. But this by far exceeded all expectations. The forest was gorgeous and lovely having a browse around the feature.

We went up to the top on all levels and really got to appreciate the waterfall and all the garden areas. Really worth doing in Singapore! For the price as well can’t go wrong.

Bear in mind the garden itself is a huge area so give more time if you want to walk to evening light show etc."
,,Connect with nature in all 5 senses,5.0,,"A visit in cloud forest will activate all your 5 senses. Even if man-made, the flora is real. We get to see a stunning waterfall more than 30m (100ft) high in the most diverse and eye catching ferns flowers and plants. At every step and level you walk, it's a new discovery and surprise. Buy ticket online for cheaper rates"
,,Stunning displays of orchids - a must-see for orchid lovers!,5.0,,"Definitely worth the fee, the Cloud Dome amazes from the moment you walk in. A stunning indoor waterfall, amazing orchid displays and plants from the world over. Make sure you take comfortable walking shoes."
,,Well worth doing,4.0,,"Combination ticket with the Flower Garden gives you a special outing. However, if you have a fear of heights you might want to give this a second thought. Walks in some cases could cause problems due to height. An elevator takes you to the top, and a series of escalators and walkways wind you done. Great views. We learned a lot."
,,Tall Waterfall a Lush Vegitation,5.0,,Such an amazing and unique experience. You enter the dome and a Tall Waterfall greets you. You move forward and a Lush green vegetation amazes you with the presence. A must visit place.
,,A really interesting and education place,5.0,,"I combined this visit with the flower dome on a long layover at Changi. I spent more time here than in the flower dome, but that was mainly due to time restraints. I could have spent way longer here. It is climate controlled and there is plenty to see and learn and enjoy."
,,Not for limited mobility,4.0,,"The trip t the top of the waterfall can be achieved by a lift but there is a lot of walking to come down, albeit there are escalators too. Really interesting plant displays and fantastic orchids."
,,Awesome Exhibit!,5.0,,A well maintained and thoughtfully planned exhibit with lots of information and beautiful plants. Great for all!
,,Stunning,5.0,,Very beautiful and the walk across the cloud forest is a must! The views are wonderful and nicely aircon.
,,neat,3.0,,it was very neat walking through this but i wouldn't be a repeat customer and i don't know if it is worth the money paid... nice way to escape the hot though!
,,What a view,5.0,,"Do the long walk up to the Cascade, take as many pictures as you can, enjoy the view. It will be a little nervous on the way down, but you will have a great view of the outside."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Stunning , allow plenty of time to look around there are lifts here to access the walkways. Temperature inside is nice and cool a nice respite from the outside heat and humidity."
,,Man-Made Amazon,3.0,,"This place is marvelous! Imagine, it was built to look like you are in Amazon though it was an indoor garden.

Highlights: The waterfall, the humidity of the place (since it is cold because of the waterfall), the view when you cross the bridge (Marina Bay), and the elevator which is really helpful for pwd&seniors.

Recommendation: Definitely a good family activity.

Entrance fee: I honestly can't remember the price since we (family) bought this online and it is bundled with Flower Dome.

P.S. Forgot to capture a photo."
,,WOW!,5.0,,"What an impressive structure, waterfall and series of gardens. Not only is this a perfect escape from the heat and humidity of a walk around the Gardens by the Bay, but it is also amazing in and of itself with a huge indoor waterfall and and amazing variety of plants. The walkway from the top down to the ground floor is thoroughly impressive. Don't miss seeing this!"
,,Marvelous experience - don't hesitate to go!,5.0,,"To describe the Cloud Garden as a jaw-dropping feat of indoor, human-cultivated nature is to not do it justice. Whether you're a horticulturist or someone who just likes to stop and sniff the flowers, this exhibit is worth visiting and revisiting -- there's so much to take in, even to inhale. You enter to a stunning view of the waterfall. There's a scenic walk up a path that leads you to elevators -- the only way up to the top of the Cloud Garden. Exit to a path down that holds marvels at every turn. There's also a secret garden at the very bottom level. You can take as much or as little time as you wish to explore. It's chilly at the bottom level - a stark contrast from the heat of the Singapore day. We didn't make it in time to see the misting, which I can only imagine to be a fun and refreshing experience. I recommend you go when it's likely to be less busy; we were there at 6:30 PM and it was just the right amount of crowds that didn't take away from the experience. If you time it right, you can see the Cloud Garden and make it out in time for the evening Supertree show at 7:45 PM (timing of this may vary by season so make sure to check the times for yourself when you're there)."
,,a must see,5.0,,"did not expect such great architecture with all the greenery and flora. The spiral walk thru all this was great, the waterfalls amazing, wonderful and relaxing"
,,enchanting view,5.0,,Beautiful and enchanting with the awesome waterfall. the flowers changes with the theme a few times a year. this place is wheelchair friendly. Staff are friendly and helpful.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Perfect experience in a warm day. The place offers flora and fauna at various altitudes and geographic expanse.

,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Amongst the fabulous and free Gardens on the Bay the paid entry Cloud Forest dome is the “piece de resistance”. Architecture is amazing, the engineering of it fascinating but what it holds ... just WOW! Waterfalls, cloud forests, orchids, all real and live. Peppered throughout with such creative sculptures of driftwood and other materials. And best of all on a hot day ... it’s so pleasant and cool in the dome.

What creative geniuses dreamed this up? How was this all planted? How is it maintained? Those are just some questions to ponder as you enjoy the wonder of this place!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful places to visit absolutely stunning, the cloud forest has been cleaverly designed, we spent a couple of hours walking around and taking in The scenery. We highly recommend when visiting Singapore you should not miss seeing this along with the flower dome in The Gardens of. Bays."
,,Not boring at all,5.0,,Went here to avoid the heat but was delighted with what was on show. Well worth a visit also visited the flower dome. Not so much to my taste but the amount of visitors in both must mean something.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Being able to go to the top of this dome, and walk your way down through the plants was an amazing experience. Standing by the waterfall as it flows into the pond a long way below is lovely. The plant life is stunning, and throughout the dome are sculptures of animals, mythical creatures and whimsical beings, usually made from fallen trees or branches, and often hidden amongst the plants, making it a fun experience for all the family."

,,Be sure and visit,5.0,,Don't miss visiting the Cloud Forest at Gardens By the Bay. Use KLOOK to get your ticket in advance and save some money over gate prices.
,,Great attraction in Garden by the bay,5.0,,Cloud forest is a cool place literally and figuratively. The vegetations and the history displayed there is great education and enjoyment.
,,A misty trail in the clouds,4.0,,"Beautiful and splendid. A refreshing respite from the scorching heat and rambling noise of urban life. It makes me appreciate what the romantic poet Wordsworth said, ""My heart leaps when I behold a rainbow in the sky."""
,,Wear comfy and slip-free shoes,5.0,,A lot of walking and it the floors tend to get slippery so it is best to wear shoes that don't slip. Best time is to go in the afternoon to get good lighting and come out at night
,,Great walk and attraction,5.0,,This is well worth a couple of hours - wander around a very well kept garden display. Quite spectacular opportunities for great pics. Air conditioned too!
,,Amazing,5.0,,So well designed. Amazing all of the plants that they have managed to get into this indoor garden. So nice to walk around and see the garden from all different heights once you go up the lift above the gardens then walk down the walk way.
,,Nothing great,2.0,,I personally did not find it very interesting or anything to be proud about. I was a waste of time and energy for me and my group. Really depends on one's choice. There are better places in Singapore to talk about
,,ONE WORD FANTASTIC,5.0,,Visited the Gradens by the bay and its a best men made Garden in the world. Cloud Forest area is simply fantastic
,,An very unique indoor forest & waterfall experience. A must visit place.,5.0,,"Singapore's gardens-by-the-bay is a beautiful place. A beautiful garden with water-stream & pond also houses 2 beautiful domes with indoor gardens.
1] Cloud forest - having a man-made rain-forest & waterfall. Its a 6-7 story tall waterfall having man-made rain forest around it. One can go to the top thru elevator & then walk-down thru a beautiful walkway spiraling the rain-forest & waterfall. Its a wonderful experience. Keep approx 2 hrs to enjoy it well.
2] Flowerdome - Next to Cloud forest, its another beautiful dome housing flowers & plants from all around the world. Although 2 hrs are good enough to see everything inside the dome, you can actually spend hours here, seeing beautiful plants & people leisurely walking/sitting. The dome's layout is such that you can see almost entire dome from every place.

I would recommend visiting both the domes. Visit Cloud-forest first for a 'mini-thrill' & then Flower-dome for leisurely, relaxing time.

You can easily reach here thru Singapore mass transit system (Metro/Buses)."
,,A wonderful place.,5.0,,Love the cloud forest. A must visit place in Singapore. It's amazing man made waterfall and has a very cool temperature when you're inside the dome. Lots of different kind flowers species to see.
,,OMG,5.0,,"Second time there and still one of the man made wonders of the world .We can not wait to return.The only advice we would give ,is pick your time to visit with care as it can get very crowded"
,,BRING A JACKET,3.0,,I like outdoor gardens. The place to me is contrived. The plants however were very interresting and some very exotic. Dont forget to bring a jacket -- it is freezing inside.
,,Jungle Mists,5.0,,"As you wind up and then down in this amazing structure, you will be captivated by the extent of the planting and the ease with which you can view all the gardens within the 'cloud'. Be prepared to experience a little light mist and remember to look outside for great views over Singapore. There is a lift for those who can't manage the steady incline however, it is not steep and there is no time limit on your journey into the clouds"
,,Cool & misty Cloud Forest,5.0,,Hourly mist and cool environment provides an enjoyable walk along the way. Elevator and escalators are available for access to the walking decks at the various levels.
,,Incredible,5.0,,Absolutely stunning. Girls loved it as did my husband and I. So beautiful. All the different types of plants. Well laid out. Waterfall was beautiful. Fantastic way to spend a few hours.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"We were blown away by the Cloud Forrest - it is a spectacular place to visit - we aren't really 'garden' people but there is so much variety and a very good walking route - the giant waterfall was amazing and getting to walk to the top was a wonderful experience

We spent about 2 hours in there - and if you are pushed for time - then I would see the Cloud Forrest over the Flower Dome

It was a real treat unlike anything we have seen before - children were also really interested and engaged"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We spent the day here & found the place absolutely stunning & so easy to get around, it had so many different varieties of plants from all over the world. Very interesting to see how well the plants grow in the conditions they have created."
,,Refreshing,4.0,,Air is fresh and cool inside the dome. Generally a pleasant visit although I prefer the flower dome.
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,"MUST SEE and absolutely beautiful! a little expensive but if you want to catch the lights by the supergrove trees you need to time almost two hours here and the other dome, the other dome is mainly flowers but changes often, absolutely beautiful!"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Beautiful, lush , stupendous and impressive in every way. Going up to the top and looking down over the waterfalls was an experience to receive! It is easy to get around and even with the crowds it is possible to feel like you are in a rainforest. Lots of exotic plants."
,,A must see wonder,5.0,,"Visit the largest internal waterfall, climb the stairs to the top to see the amazing view. beautiful flower displays on every level. Air conditioned to escape the intense humidity."
,,Interesting even for the non gardeners,3.0,,This is actually quite interesting. Right at the top they had carnivorous plants! Some plants were so small they provided magnifying glasses to see them! It's really well done
,,Vacation,4.0,,"Went to the Cloud Forest, so beautiful inside. I loved all the plants and the huge waterfall. Went to the top and could look down over the plants."
,,Really neat experience,4.0,,"This was a very neat experience.

I only did cloud Forest as advised by other travellers that 2 domes is expensive and the waterfall experience is the best. Certainly enjoyed seeing this.

Very informative at the end to understand more about the purpose.

Worth doing for sure !"
,,Highly recommend this experience,5.0,,"Loved everything about this attraction. It’s beautiful. Rich in plants, trees and flowers. It’s huge. Very ambitious and so well done. When on a visit to Singapore you will enjoy the cooling off by just entering the attraction. Then every floor and turn is a nice surprise of amazing rain forest vegetation. Well maintained and gorgeous. I loved the orchids. The color. Everything."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We visited the greenhouse during the Chinese New Year so it’s been overcrowded and it took a while to get to the top and complete the walk. However, the waterfall located near the entrance is stunning and it’s a great place for green lovers."
,,This was a must-see at the Gardens!,5.0,,"My friend and I visited the Gardens for the first time, and LOVED it! We purchased the ticket that allowed us access to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, after seeing both, I would suggest the Cloud Forest if you had to choose one. It was absolutely beautiful and a work of such meaningful-art. We really enjoyed our time here, I would highly recommend a visit. :-)"
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,"Beautiful scenery while walking around the cloud forest . Towards the end (inside) , there is a little cinema that show cases the effects of climate change."
,,Paid to Walk,4.0,,"Ground floor was more exciting than going inside the forest. Expect that the experience is mainly for kids, but even then, kids might find it boring. You start with a sight of the waterfalls, and tourists taking turns to take a picture below. Then you go up to an elevator, and walk down through a hanging bridge. Basically, you'll see the same sight up there."
,,Great man made attraction,5.0,,Its a feeling that you are really in the real forest. The amazing collection and arrangements is great work. There is an entry ticket and you need around 2-3 hours for complete visit.
,,Don’t miss this,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay are spectacular, the Cloud Forest was our favourite part after the super trees. The whole thing is spectacular and a joy to walk around.You need to buy a tkt, we visited over Chinese NY so it was busy but we didn’t queue for very long.
We had a good lunch in Pollen, a bit of a quiet oasis from the crowds.
Plenty of facilities."
,,Forest Frenzy,4.0,,"At first look this place looks like an overgrown high rise carpark particular for those visitors who are from countries used to ""the great outdoors"". However there is enough variety and innovation built into this attraction to make it quite interesting and enjoyable. The highlights? The two sky walks and the grotto area located at ground level are probably the picks. They even have a few Wollemi Pines!"
,,Unique Greenhouse,5.0,,My favorite part of the cloud forest is definitely the waterfall you see once you enter. Go early at opening time to avoid crowds and to get a great photo without photo bombers. It is also really cool inside which is great to escape the heat from Singapore
,,Amazing must see Singapore,5.0,,This place is as incredible in real life as it is the photos just amazing . Try to be there when they do the misting. Amazing atmosphere
,,Impressive,5.0,,A must visit when in Singapore. It's so impressive to see so much nature packed into an indoor area. Worth the price of admission.
,,Unbelievable Inside Rainforest,5.0,,Greeted by the huge waterfall this experience is incredible. Plenty of photo opportunities and some wildlife you would have to trek to the tops of mountains to see. Well worth a visit.
,,Admission fee is well worth every penny.,5.0,,This complex must be one of the wonders of the modern world. Make sure your visit coincides with the mist turned on. It is impossible to describe the beauty of it. What a feeling of euphoria being in there. On a visit to Singapore it’s a must.
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,"To those of us who love gardens, the Cloud Forest and Botanical gardens are an incredible treat of beauty and unique layout of multitude of plants from all over the world. We walked through each and every section of this wonderful place and would love to go again and visit with more time to spend and soak the beauty of this place."
,,"Beautiful place, go there early in the morning before the crowds!",5.0,,"Touristy, but very enjoyable and well air-conditioned even in hot humid days! Would recommend a good 2 hours to walk around the entire area of the Gardens by the bay. There's a lot of places to see within the complex."
,,Nice break from the heat,3.0,,"After the Flower Dome and Skywalk, the Cloud forest was a little underwhelming. The waterfall at the beginning was the best part."
,,OK,3.0,,Visited but this is not as spectacular as the Garden Dome probably because the plants are not as stunning but still worth seeing
,,Tropical Forest in the City,5.0,,"I found it amazing despite the New Year's peak season and the place is practically jam-packed with visitors, we still managed to walk around freely and having some photo shoots.
It's a wonderful visit! The waterfall is magnificent and very beautiful. The forest has a cool atmosphere and really a state of art!
We love our visit here and it was surely a place not to be missed on a Singapore visit.."
,,Unbeleiveable,5.0,,"such a special place, great to experience how they have magically created such a wonderful place for us to explore, great to get out of the heat also nice and cool inside. worth the visit"
,,Waterfall,5.0,,One of the 2 indoor curiosities to visit in the Gardens By the Bay. Beautiful waterfall and amazing tropical vegetation can be seen there.
,,unique,5.0,,glass houses are a must - allow at least three hours for your visit to the site - must say i loved the water fountains for the children
,,You definitely get wet!,5.0,,"Once inside it's a life time experience. There's the waterfall that makes visitors get wet and also for those who like adventures, you can take a walk up high."
,,Just when you thought it couldn't get any better,5.0,,"Replicates a mossy forest complete with a huge waterfall and diverse vegetation. Each level is different as you move down the mountain. Be sure to stop on each level; the crystals are very interesting if you've never seen stalactites. You can do the walk, even if you have a fear of heights like me. You won't fall off the edge!"
,,Nice walk and easy way to cool off,4.0,,28 $ to get in includes the flower some. Like a breath of fresh air walking in. Beautifully manicured man made forest. There’s a video on renewable energy worth watching. Quite busy and crowded for photos.
,,part of gardens by the bay,4.0,,It is part of gardens by the bay. Not an extraordinary thing but nicely maintained and is quite beautiful
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Very good overview of different flora spaces in a sort of compressed scenario, very well conditioned and easy to visit."
,,Interesting tropical experience,3.0,,A typical tropical environment with peculiar plants and flowers. Nice descriptions and landscapes. A jump into the tropical forest. A must for all westerns like me.
,,Excelent,5.0,,This is one huge green instalation which you can visit from the top to the bottom by walking on the sky bridges.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful. I spent the whole time inside walking around even more in awe than the moment before!
,,Totally transporting,5.0,,"If it weren’t for the structure of elevators and concrete walkways you could be in the rainforest. Still how else can people enjoy such a place on a mass level. It was beautiful- all the ferns, orchids, begonias it was very much an almost real forest. Spectacular engineering!"
,,Refreshing waterfall,5.0,,"A refreshing welcome when you enter the Cloud Forest 🌳 ☁️ A cool & relaxing walk .. In an air-conditioned space .. Flowers, trees. plants.. Landscape is terrific 💐💐💐"
,,Beautiful and so peaceful,5.0,,We spent several hours here exploring and relaxing in this Eden of nature and tranquility. You must visit if you’re in Singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The first attraction you see is the waterfall, spectacular. The cloud forest has orchids, pitcher plants and ferns. The suspension walkways overlook the dome, spectacular"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"An awesome day to experience this wonder. An amazing attraction. It does get fairly crowded and busy, so I recommend going early."
,,An absolute must see in SInagpore,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay (which includes the Cloud Dome and the Flower Dome ) is an absolute must see when you visit Singapore. Even if you are not much of a gardener, the sheer size and architecture of the gardens will take your breathe away!"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Loved the concept.. to see how a urban city could transform in to an echo friendly green retreat is very unique Loved the walk inside
,,Very interesting,4.0,,Really nice place to visit in the Gardens by the Bay complex. Also check out the Flower Dome and OCBC Skyway and Supertree Grove.
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,Gardens by the Bay is a must and the Cloud Forest is exceptional and a great place to cool down. Excellent variety of plants.
,,greeny place,5.0,,"Its refreshing place,tidy place. Not a fan with garden view but this is great place to waste your time at singapore."
,,This place was brilliant and is a must see,5.0,,This place in the Gardens by the Bay complex is a definite must see. From the moment you walk through the entrance you are met by this fantastic waterfall cascading down in front of you. You then proceed to make your way to the top while travelling through numerous themed garden exhibits. Well signposted and if you are fortunate to be in the dome during a misting period it is an amazing place to visit.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,This is well the visit to see all the different plants as you come down the misty mountain. We were there in the afternoon and there were minimal crowds even though it was holiday season.
,,Not as night as the Flower Dome,3.0,,"The Cloud Forest was a good experience, especially if you time your viewing when they have the ""cloud forming"" mist. However, I thought the Flower Dome was a lot nicer and had a lot more things going on."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,It may look steep but it is an easy walk (including an elevator ride) along the top of the cloud forest. We werent lucky enough to be there when the clouds formed but they do happen regularly.
,,Gardens Highlight,5.0,,"This is the primary highlight for Gardens by the Bay, just fantastic. If onlu more people looked at what they were seeing rather than just took photos / selfies!"
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"If you have time, do visit this place and see all the beautiful flowers. It’s more than just the flowers, you will get a good reminder why we all need to be take care of this planet."
,,Must see attraction in Singapore,5.0,,the entire garden complex is a must see. Take your time to wander through and catch the lift up to the top and walk down - its like walking though a vertical cross section of the plants of the world.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A must do in Singapore for any age. So well set out and easy to walk around. The could forest was beautiful, not to be missed. The night show was also lovely."
,,Wow - A Must,5.0,,Be early to avoid crowds- not to be missed when visiting Singapore. The staff are helpful and polite. A must.
,,Boring,2.0,,It's a large greenhouse with some trees and lots of rude people? Enjoy trees and rude people? Knock yourself out.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,Loved the Cloud Forrest at Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. I felt that the $16 entrance fee was good value as it is quite an amazing experience with everything there is to see. Of course the waterfall takes centre stage however there is an abundance or plant life that would make any David gardener green with envy. Being scared of heights I couldn't manage the high platform walkways but I still managed to view a lot and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Would highly recommend visiting the Cloud Forrest if you are visiting Singapore.
,,Well worth an afternoon,5.0,,Loved the Cloud Forest. Biggest collection of carnivorous plants I have ever seen. It was simply amazing.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Very informative place to wander around, showing trees and plants from almost every country in the world, plus it was nice and cool, I would visit here again."
,,"Much bigger in person, highly recommend checking it out!",5.0,,The waterfall is huge in person! The pictures really don't do it justice. Its several stories tall and definitely worth a visit.
,,Magical experience,5.0,,We had a 12 hour lay over in Singapore so we decided to take a train and explore a bit (the train system is excellent by the way). We went to the cloud forest. It is breath takingly beautiful. I would recommend any one who has a chance to visit it to go!
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Visited here as part of the tour of Gardens of the Bay . Interesting and informative. Good place to cool down in the heat!
,,Super,5.0,,"Breathtaking view from the top. Artificial water fall is superb, Fully climate controlled. Mindblowing"
,,Awesome human creation,4.0,,"This is one place you cant miss visiting. Most commendable design planning. Maintaining such a place which has so many visitors must be a task. The place is clean, well maintained, with lots of sign boards.Very helpful staff."
,,Unique in Singapore,5.0,,It’s a beautiful place to visit in this smal country. Giant indoor waterfall and the plants make a forest feeling which I can truely feel the nature. I like they make the description and even some unique rain forest plant are in there
,,Wonderful plants and welcome respite from the heat.,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is quite different from it's larger sister, the Flower Dome, but no less worth a visit. The walk to the top of the rainforest display is stunning, with lush vegetation in all directions. Inside the ""mountain"" are various interesting displays about plants and geology. Well worth a trip, and a longer stay if you're suffering from Singapore's heat and humidity."
,,Another great garden in Singapore,5.0,,"Again, a mixture of nature and man-made structures, this architecturally and technically advanced garden, found inside the Marina bay gardens is one of the musts when one goes to Singapore. You have to make your way up to the top and down again, for about an hour, but the vegetation on the road and the views are amazing. There are plenty of people inside the Cloud Forest - more than any other nature-relevant sight in Singapore. This is also a place to get a little break from the heat outside, as it seems to be climatized. A lot of nice pictures can be taken as my gallery shows."
,,Top notch,5.0,,"I had been to the cloud walk 5 years ago but being afraid of heights I just wizzed around very fast. Last week I went back and was surprised by the beauty and and serene feeling I had walking around the top of the trees. I was a real tourist I took many photos of the greenery the water falls and the misty air rising to the top of the dome.
It was a truly lovely experience and I am so pleased I went back and was able to walk the walkway and feel very peaceful.
It is a tour suitable for all ages."
,,So Glad We Did This!!!,5.0,,"This is one of those things you look at from your trip and think that was the best I’m so glad we did this!!

We went with the intention of going to the Tree skywalk but unfortunately got there 5mins too late. However the Flower Garden and Cloud Forest we’re still open. The operator at the ticket counter said they would highly recommend the Cloud Forest so not knowing what is was or what is was about we gave it a go! And it was probably my most favorite thing about our trip!

This is something you can enjoy solo, with friends, family or a romantic spot to visit as couple. Be immersed by all the levels to explore the beauty of the gardens and waterfall and the sky walking track. We had a pram with us and was no problems getting around. We went at night as advised for the visual with lights but also as it’s cooler. We had such a great time!

Next time I would have gone earlier around 6pm to fit both the tree walk and the cloud Forest. Cloud Forest is about $28 and I believe tree walk is $9. So depending on your budget you may choose only the tree walk but allow plenty of time to enjoy it.

There is a taxi bay out front of Gardens by the Bay for easy drop off/pick up. And McDonald’s and a cafe for food/drinks and bathrooms. And views of Marina Bay Sands. So if your not staying there you can view the hotel lit up at night from the venue.

Cloud Forest - Amazing! Loved it! Make sure you pop it on your to do list it will really make your night! It’s really beautiful and you’ll walk out feeling refreshed and really good!"
,,Impressive Feature,5.0,,This over the top greenhouse features a very impressive indoor waterfall. Very well laid out with exotic plants and some exquisite flora. the misting experience was also enjoyed by the kids. It is a lovely experience to visit this venue to enjoy nature on another level. Also it being indoors helps get out of the blistering heat or the rain.
,,Stunning,5.0,,An amazing array of exotic plants. A definite must visit if you are in Singapore. Visually stunning.
,,A Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful display of waterfalls, flora and man-made ""nature"". A good walk to the top and then back to the bottom. Would definitely recommend"
,,Cloud dome,5.0,,An amazing garden with wonderful plants and presentation. I loved it. I spent more than an hour and a half there.
,,Worth the money,5.0,,"Whilst the Gardens are free you have to pay for the cloud forest but it is interesting, different and well presented."
,,Indoor watefall,4.0,,Been here several times but nothing beats natural...Though Its quite comfortable to go in after a long walk around the garden.
,,Cool place on a hot day,5.0,,"The gardens are free to get into, but it’s worth paying the extra for the flower dome and cloud forest. Whilst it can be busy at times, it’s definitely worth seeing"
,,Not with teenage boys!,2.0,,"Rather expensive elevator trip, not a lot too see or do. Man made waterfall inside a very impressive building. Lots of other interesting thing to do in Singapore without dragging teenagers through this."
,,Amazing to see 🥦,5.0,,"Incredible !
How they manage to get all the plants thriving in this environment is unreal. It was cool inside and the waterfall was amazing. Allow 3-4 hours to see most of it if you go early in the morning the crowds are alot less and you can take your time.
Recommend this attraction
5 Stars"
,,Disappointing.,2.0,,"The cloudforest is in my opinion not worth the money. Hardly any information on plants, cloudforests or whatsoever. Too expensive and uninspiring. Very artificial."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Amazing to see so many different plants and flowers, just a mindblowing experience for anyone who likes plants"
,,"Just beautiful, relaxing and an escape from the heat.",5.0,,"The cloud gardens were impressive and beautifully designed with an amazing indoor waterfall. Different plants from countries all over the world and cultural influences. There is a few different levels so you get the aspect of the gardens from above and below.

They will also give you a stamp to renter on the same day."

,,Incredible experience,5.0,,"We absolutely loved this place, it is fascinating and so well laid out too. I also liked the educational side, really makes you think about the planet. Highly recommended."
,,Better part of the 2,5.0,,"The 'mountain' (inside the covered exhibit) is approx 100 ft high and you get to the top by an elevator from the inner core. The sides are totally planted with stunning orchids, ferns and other tropic bromeliads highlighted by a massive waterfall. The walkway that wraps around the mountain is absolutely exhilarating experience -- giving the visitor an unparalleled view of tree tops and centers of giant ferns.
The short movie at the end of the exhibit is a must; and virtually explains why Singapore is so dedicated about making the city green for the population. Don't miss."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Unbelievable exhibit within the Gardens by the Bay area. An extraordinary and huge exhibit that takes your breath away as you walk through the tree tops (and above them).
,,Amazing,5.0,,The sense of awe when you walk in is just amazing. My five year old thought he was going on a magical adventure. Well worth the entry fee.
,,An experience,5.0,,"A must! It’s a beautiful conservatory . A bit scary at first as you are really high up on the walk way, but a true experience .A great tall water fall , misty forest and plants of all types."
,,Cloud Forest worth the entry fee.,5.0,,One of the most amazing attractions in Singapore. Everyone will enjoy this from oldies to young children. The video on the way out is worth watching too.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Loved it! Unfortunately there was some sort of event on that day and the crowd was a little overwhelming, but later in the day after the crowd dispersed it was lovely to walk around and experience the place properly.

I love the cold personally, but my mother found it too cold, bring something warm to wrap up in if you're sensitive."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Had a wonderful time walking through and really enjoyed the waterfall i was so relaxed by the end of it.
,,Beautiful view below!,3.0,,"Visited last September 25, 2018 It was cold inside the dome, I am sensitive to cold, bring jacket or cardigan. If you are born in the country (like me Philippines) with lots of trees and green plants this place is not appealing to you. Though the view below you will makes you feel, liking the place. Wonderful exterior design is the attraction on this place."
,,Cloud Forest - Beautiful Experience,5.0,,"Love Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay!! Exceptional experience and beautifully done, this was one of the highlights of my trip."
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,An amazing experience and a must for everyone one to visit. Truly magical. So breathtaking and such good value or money
,,Cloud,3.0,,Indoor rain forest is what we seen here.... full of green but its not something you should never miss....
,,Truly amazing,5.0,,"Probably the best botanic garden I've visited. Complicated building structure and the whole green ""rock"" structure along with smart planting and watering systems. Wery well looked kept area. I have never seen thing alike. If you're in the city it's a Must visit."
,,Worth visit,5.0,,"Wow, from the moment you enter the dome you are in awe of the Central structure the waterfall and the cloud walk! The whole dome is awesome"

,,A Totally Awesome 'Must Do',5.0,,"What an amazing experience! We had heard so much about the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay and were blown away with how fabulous it is. From the bottom, to the top and all around there is just so much to see and learn about. We were there during a particularly busy time with a coinciding Orchid Festival being held and whilst it was very crowded and at times this hindered our being able to see things properly, it will still an amazing experience - a 'Must Do' in Singapore."
,,Waterfall,4.0,,I went there with my husband and children. We went to see the Christmas decoration. We went to stroll around the Cloud Forest too. I love the waterfall as it want cooling when we standing near the water.
,,Very nice,5.0,,"I liked the long indoor waterfall. It really creates an illusion of clouds or fog. I really liked the foggy waterfall within that greenery. It's a must visit place. It is in the garden by the bay. You can walk around at garden by the bay for free but to enter cloud forest and flower done, you have to purchase ticket. It is one ticket and you visit both cloud forest and the flower dome."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It was very beautiful! The indoor waterfall, the forest, the walkway, the beauty of the place overall...a very unique place. I haven't seen another like it."
,,A different world,5.0,,Inside the dome is it's own eco system with temperature that is definitely not of our normal singapore weather. The plants are very interesting and nice to see. Great for photo taking sessions.
,,Just Breathtaking,5.0,,"The moment you step in you feel you are in a mountain forest, everything is replicated to the cloud forest in the tropical jungle..must see"
,,Excellent attraction,5.0,,"We spotted the gardens from the viewing platform of the Marina Sands. They looked very interesting from 40-odd levels up and not knowing much about them, we were so pleased that we had decided to go and investigate them.
Both the indoor and the outdoor areas look like you are on the sound stages for ""Avatar"". The Cloud Forest is by far the best, and is an amazing piece of architecture, fun park and tropical garden all rolled into one.
A definite, must do."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Really spacious with so many kinds of flowers and plant species. Very well maintained and flowers all looking fresh. Nice day and night views of the beautiful city.
,,WOW!!,5.0,,"Again, a destination well worth the visit. The indoor waterfall and associated plantings are so well done and well cared for. Do not miss going to the top and walking down the aerial ramps around the ""mountain."""
,,BEAUTIFUL!,5.0,,"We loved this dome the best. Definitely worth seeing. Try get there at misting time but if you miss it - not a huge loss. It does get a bit cold inside so bring a light jacket (especially for kids). We enjoyed a leisurely walk down from the top. Top garden was great.
Really recommend it."
,,Clouds were missing,5.0,,"As were walking on the high raised walking trails, we expected that we will be covered with clouds but unfortunately the Cloud Forest didn't have any clouds. Yes the forest below is mesmerizing and loved the way everything is designed, well kept and beautifully managed."
,,Amazing to see,4.0,,"A friend and I visited the Cloud Forest on a very rainy afternoon. It was amazing to see the waterfall and the changing vegetation as you climbed higher up the forest. There were great views from the top, plus the rain rolling down the outside of the glass made for a very interesting experience."
,,Unique concept and mindblowing,5.0,,"As you enter into this dome, you are welcomed by a huge man made waterfall just in front of you. As you walk along the path, green patches of different types of plants from far off lands invite you to a glorious experience. The freshness of the plants is quite inviting and the place is air conditioned. You take the elevator to the 6th level and take the stairs to the 7th level. From this point, one has walk down on the walkway path. You also get a view of the Marina Bay Sands and Marina Barrage from the top. You also get to view some interesting species of plants from the Amazon and other parts of the world."
,,Beautiful and exotic array of plants from all around the world!,4.0,,"As a local who doesn't really spend much time visiting attractions, I had an opportunity to take a foreign guest the this place. It did not disappoint at all. It was air conditioned and I came across alot of different plants that I would not have come across. It so happen it was tulip season and many of them were flown in from the Netherlands to Singapore. There were many shades of it and we took so many pictures! Hours floated by, and I would definitely say its a place for both genders and the family!

Don't forget to stick around for the nightly shows by the Super Trees! The light shows accompanied with the music were very entertaining.

Fyi, book your tickets online through apps like ""carousell"" or ""qoo10"" through 3rd party sellers. The discounted price is worth it."
,,beautiful,5.0,,this was so beautiful. and so well maintained. lovely photos to be taken here. and staff control crowds and are so efficient
,,Excellent place for botanical study,5.0,,They have different types of plants. The lego plants and the tree top walk way are nice. Mist show is just alright though.
,,Don't Miss This Magical Experience,5.0,,"By far our highlight to the Gardens by the Bay was the Cloud Forest. You can enter with a small fee both the cloud and the flower domes. We were particularly amazed by the cloud forest. A huge waterfall, countless floral specimens, and a wonderful walkway to explore all afford you a magical garden experience. Crowds were not really an issue as everyone moved along at their own pace, whether you wish to stop for photos or read about the plantlife, you won't be disappointed. The area is extremely well maintained, the overall signature of anything really throughout Singapore."
,,Spectacular flora exhibit & amazing architecture,5.0,,"An enclosed glass-dome, beautifully decorated garden, densely packed with lush tropical plants, trees, statues, water and waterfalls, artwork, upper-level viewing walkway, and more."
,,This place did not disappoint,5.0,,Like the title says The Cloud Forest at the Gardens is amazing! Everywhere you look there is something to see!
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"It was a great and very interesting place to visit. The indoor waterfall and the water cycle created here is extraordinary. However, we did find it to be a little bit expensive."
,,Excellent Indoor Garden,5.0,,I am not too much into garden but I likes cloud Forest. The lift takes you to top and then you make your way back slowly enjoying probably the best indoor garden in the world . highly recommended.
,,The best of the two glass houses,5.0,,"Both the glass houses are good, but the Cloud Forest one is spectacular. Not just the waterfalls, but all the other displays that you see going round."
,,Cooling down,5.0,,It's lovely to enter cooler environment from over 30 degrees heat outside. Nice relaxing time and a little walk
,,Wonderful Place,5.0,,Cloud Forest is really wonderful garden of Singapore. It is really a wonder of the world for nature lovers. One of it's kind in the world which is worth to visit. It's entrance is through tickets but always remain overcrowded by visitors. We explored it completely from bottom to top.There is beautiful water fall at the entrance.
,,Refreshing garden in town,4.0,,"Cloud forest is part of Gardens By The Bay, along with the Flower Dome. It’s nice to see the waterfall inside. If you like plants, you’ll enjoy your time here.

Unfortunately we came during Christmas eve and it was very crowded with people so we cannot really enjoy it."
,,certainly worthy of a visit,5.0,,"We went to both the flower dome and the cloud forest and this was our favourite. the sheer size of the work , structure and plants to fill this space is amazing. The temperature was a reprieve from the heat and the views from the top .. stunning! we went over to Satay by the Bay for dinner after a walk around, for a cold beer before heading back to the gardens for the light show at 645 - then onto the light show at the front of Marina bay sands for 9pm .both worthwhile ."
,,Constructional Wonder,4.0,,It's a very nice place to visit. Relaxing as the cold inside. Good place for nature lover and very picturesque.
,,Have to have a walk inside,4.0,,"Its a lot cooler inside this structure, so its a good place to get out of the heat. They have done a amazing job with the plants and design and its quite relaxing walking around the sky paths looking at the views and different plants"
,,Definitely a highlight,5.0,,As you walk in the first waterfall is breathtaking. And it spectacularly continues from there. The conservation section brought me to tears. PLEASE NOTE : food and drinks not permitted.
,,Bit Expensive but Worth It - Very Unique and Just Beautiful,5.0,,"We weren't going to pay to enter the cloud and flower dome but are so glad we did. The kids loved it as well and it's such a beautiful area to explore at your own pace. Best thing is, they are both cooled and it's a welcome relief to the humidity of Singapore :-)"
,,Nice cool views,5.0,,It’s very cooling in the cloud forest and the views from the top were spectacular. The orchids were gorgeous as were every other plant life.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,This is part of the Gardens by the bay park and the cloud forest is the key attraction there. It was heavily crowded due to Chrtismas week.
,,Indoor Waterfall,4.0,,The waterfall is beautiful. The flowers are pretty too. There are so many photo spots. Great place to visit
,,Expected more!,3.0,,"We found it a bit disappointing as everyone tells you to come here but it's expensive as each part is separate e.g $64 for 4 adults for each area. The flower Dome, Cloud Forest and skybride. Make sure that you check the last entrance allowance! As they stop admitting people to the various areas at different times! I would not recommend it, although this dome is better than the Flower dome."
,,Post cruise visit,4.0,,Spent just o at 4 hours at the Gardens prior to our flight. Both indoor exhibitions were well worth the visit. Walkable from the cruise terminal. There is also facilities to leave your bags at the cruise terminal- 33 Singapore dollars for 4 bags.
,,speechless,5.0,,as a guy from a tropical country (Philippines) i am very familiar with forests and what not. this place is doing the best in having literally a rain forest in the city. all plants are arranged according to there specific elevation. the science behind. kudos to the team
,,Booking tickets,5.0,,Booking with trip advisor was waste of time they dont let you book day before not like park offical website or you can buy tickets directly from counters... Thank god or my day will be ruined
,,No Clouds at cloud forest,4.0,,"The place itself is an amazing sight but from all the information I had read was expecting more of the cloud and mist effects and apart from a small area near lift there was none.
The flowers and displays are great.
Long queues but could have been time went. They have you be in a single line up to cave entrance but then you go into a mass queue for lifts and this created some mayhem and pushing etc"
,,Fine,3.0,,"Not bad, nothing world changing. An expensive walk, I would recommend doing either this or the botanic gardens"
,,A must visit!,5.0,,It's an amazing sight to see especially to walk through the different levels of the cloud forest. I was in Awww when I say the cascading waterfall.
,,Excellent infrastructure and maintains,5.0,,A must watch for Singapore tour Very rare to find in the world Be prepared to take good pics Preferable wear white but could improve maps and dining places
,,Fairyland,5.0,,Beautiful landscapes. It was like the Babylon gardens which you read in history “The Hanging gardens” and now we see in in Cloud Garden. Amazing it was truly like we were floating there. And varieties of plant species “ Amazing” ... Must see
,,Great place!,5.0,,"It’s a beautiful spot for tourists or residents to cool off from the heat and enjoy nature! If you like modern structures, you will love it!"
,,Good For Plant Lovers,4.0,,I personally is not a big orchid or small plant enthusiast but this place has got a lot of varieties and specially children will love the carnivorous plant like the nepenthes or the Venus fly trap... The place is good by design and well maintained and can be put in place of not exactly must visit but visit if you have time....
,,Loved this place,5.0,,great place to visit with all the colour of the plants and flowers the water falls inside this building
,,Man made wonder,5.0,,"This place is truly breathtaking! With two cooled conservatories, over a million different plants and flowers and incredible Supertrees you can easily spend a day here exploring the gardens. Simply spectacular! Coming back again because one can’t have enough of this!"
,,Fantastic Forest,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was amazing, so much bigger than we expected!
It's hard not to be overawed with the waterfall at the entrance but walk slowly on and there is so much more to see. It's also cool so a great place to escape the humidity.
We were there while the mist was being released which was even more beautiful (check with Cloud Forest for times and details)."
,,Beautifullly man made forest,4.0,,"Had a good holiday with children and family. The staff were quite cooperative even though there were many tourists to handle. The only drawback is its more on the expensive side , hope they should reconsider about the fees."
,,gotta go,5.0,,was an incredible experience. so worth while to take part in a special landmark in Singapore. Great couple of hours in a great part of the city
,,Epic indoor waterfall,5.0,,The minute you walk through the entrance your jaw will drop at the sight of the spectacular waterfall. The lush plants are superbly integrated with the man made structure that showcases flora found at different altitudes in a compact but awe inspiring way. Arrive early to avoid the crowds and visit both exhibits before browsing the common gift shop which they both end up at.
,,"Beautiful, skywalk a must!",5.0,,"This is another beautiful and well kept garden and its free to enter. You do have to pay money to go up the ocbc skywalk. It's not too expensive and it gives you a different vantage point of the super trees and marina bay sands hotel. The views at night are spectacular with lighting from the super trees. I don't think there is any lighting if you were to visit in the daytime. Not sure though, since I've not been here during the day, only nights. 1st picture was taken on the skywalk, 2nd picture was below it."
,,Stunning,5.0,,The waterfall is nothing short of breathtaking. The dome is well worth the price with its lush greenery and aerial walkways. Certainly a unique experience! A must-do if you're visiting Gardens by the Bay.
,,Just Wow!,5.0,,What a way to welcome visitors by having that man-made water fall upon entry. There'so much variety of flowers! The place is air-conditioned to ensure plant and visitors are comfortable.
,,We loved it.,5.0,,"Had visited the Flower Dome, and felt just a little let down, so we approached the Cloud Forest somewhat dubiously. Our disappointment did not continue here, and we spent a really enjoyable hour and a half here, fascinated by the plants and their settings. The whole walk round was well organised, with some fabulous species on display, with the huge artificial waterfall to set everything off. Beautiful orchids, and some other very colourful plants nestling amidst the other plants Particularly intrigued by the huge sculptures carved out of various woods. From seeing others going round with headphones, we believe that it was possible to have an audioguide which would have added to the enjoyment of the visit, but sadly didn’t find any information about how to get this!"
,,Beautiful way to spend time,5.0,,Visit was worth the money and luckily there was not many people that time so we were luckily able to go straight in without the queue.
,,Waterfall is the higlight!,4.0,,"The waterfall takes your breath away but there is more that than just waterfall. Once you get in the Lost Word, Secret Garden and understand how the climate is changing you will leave with a lot of information. They have presented it brilliantly."
,,World class sight,5.0,,"The paid area of Cloud Forest is the highlight of the area though with its futuristic dome straight out of a sci-fi film housing the namesake forest. We made it in just in time for the misting which gave the place even a more surreal look. Taking the elevator to the top and working your way down from the walkways gives very different, but all spectacular, perspective of the impressive forest with various plant life and the occasional works of art along the way. Best of all, the air-conditioned dome is a great escape from the humidity outside."
,,Fun Experience,5.0,,We paired oue visit here with the Flower Dome and had an enjoyable day. This place is amazing. I would suggest that you head to the elevators first as the line can be long and then you're waiting a long time just to get started. You'll take the elevator to the top and then slowly make your way down looking at the beautiful waterfall and gardens. My family of engineers was having as much fun looking at the marvel of the inside of the dome as well as the visual beauty. Even if you're a bit afraid of heights I think you will enjoy the experience the Cloud Forest has to offer. Hard to describe just how cool this place is inside. The view is amazing as you start from the top of the dome and walk the elevated path down to where you started. There is also a place you can step out and get a good view of the waterfall. This is definitely a place you don't want to miss. We'll be back when family comes to visit.
,,Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,Second visit to the Gardens By the Bay well worth it. The only down full is the catering. Do as we did eat before you go unless you like the big M and other fast foods.
,,Incredible,5.0,,This was amazing. We spent a great deal of time looking at the different flowers and views of the waterfall. The climate in here was cooler compared to the hot and humid conditions outside.
,,A bit hypocritical,3.0,,"Overall cloud forest and flower dome were impressive in their efforts to bring the flora of several countries under one roof in a vivid way. What challenged me was the call to adopt a sustainable
lifestyle and care for the environment through their displays, yet their gift shops freely gave away plastic bags to customers, packaged most things in plastic.
The eateries around on premises served food in single use plastic.
Singapore needs to consider their heavy use of single use plastic as it is phenomenal to observe how plastic bags are freely given out to customers even when they purchase a single item or a small
Item.
Disappointed with the mixed messages."
,,Impressive!,5.0,,Wow! We did Flower Dome first and were a bit underwhelmed and was wondering what the hype was about and then we did Cloud Forest (after going through the shared gift shop). I would recommend doing it in this order too. We were awestruck from the time we first stepped inside to gaze up at the impressive waterfall and feel the spray. Elevators take you to the top and you walk back down a series of skywalks and escalators. The flora was outstanding and they do a good job of explaining it all. You might not like the Global Warming I fo if you are from the US and are a Trump supporter who doesn’t believe in science. Very well done. I would recommend visiting during the day as it is air conditioned and a great way to beat the heat!
,,Must see venue. Please give yourself a treat an visit this attraction.,5.0,,A place that will blow your mind and scintilate the senses. Congratulations Singapore on a great attraction.
,,Long queues - and good to see,3.0,,"If you're going to visit, I recommend doing so at night. I loved seeing the Cloud Forest and the other parts of the Gardens by the Bay as the day goes from daylight to darkness, and the lights as they come on. The surrounding area really is spectacular.

The Cloud Forest concept really is outstanding. The opportunity to enter into a kind of atmosphere and environment that I'm unlikely to be experience in person was great.

Personally, I would have appreciated more information signs throughout. We didn't get the audio tour, but if I was doing it again, I would add that."
,,"Amazing place, best out of 2 domes.",5.0,,"The walk through the 'cloud' provides a stunning view. If short in time, start with this one first. The supertrees and flower dome are also very nice, but this one excels!"
,,Unmissable while you are in Singapore,5.0,,"You can get a lift to the top of the waterfall and work your way down - this was an unmissable experience and its definitely worth going early to beat the queues!

There are also some interesting videos at the end which highlight the effects of climate change and how people are working to prevent it - I do think people would have paid more attention if this was before you enter the dome though."
,,One of the conservatories of Gardens by The Bay,4.0,,"A huge waterfall right under an enclosed chamber controlled atmosphere array of selection of flowers, herbs gives a mesmerizing experience."
,,Great place for young kids,5.0,,"This place held a magical fascination for our son. It was like walking through a storybook landscape, and it was a wonderful relief from the Singapore heat in the middle of the day."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Visiting cloud forest was one of the best decision we made in Singapore. The water fall is very beautiful and they have organized this place in amazing way. A must visit place.
,,Interesting...,4.0,,Good to experience with Flower Dome. I would not do this again though as you are climbing up and up and if you dont like heights you might get a bit dizzy or tired.
,,Completely worthy!!,5.0,,"Amazing and stunning view, masterpiece of bothanic, art, light and engineering. Absolutely recommended"
,,A must for Nature lovers.,5.0,,I will visit this again when time permits. A wonderful creation and it amasing how nature of different climates have been brought under one roof
,,Largest indoor waterfall,3.0,,"It’s worth to visit this place in the evening waterfall looks amazing!
It’s a nice place to visit with a family and walk around all the levels but it gets really crowded here and I think it’s a bit overpriced really. It’s a nice experience though but I wouldn’t necessarily rush to comeback once I’ve visited it."
,,Lovely day out,4.0,,Loved our trip to the Cloud forest at Marina Bay. Great use of architecture and nature. Calming and cool. Amazing plant life and great views of city. I would definitely go back.
,,Cloud forest,4.0,,"The cloud forest was certainly worth a look, extremely crowded, but cool and the stunning displays, carvings hidden around and ofcourse the wonderful waterfall. Also it gave a great view of the harbour."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Very beautiful place with different plants from almost any part of the world. Definitely must visit, especially beautiful during mist time."
,,Amazing day at cloud forest.,5.0,,All are man-made but all are amazing too. Have to compliment all the engineers for creating a tourist attraction place like this in Singapore.
,,Cool but slightly costly,4.0,,"The area is pretty big to actually fully explore it. There are also a couple of spots for nice photos to be taken. Would suggest to visit it in the day, where the lighting would be better for better photos. Bring a jacket too, as personally it was cold for me"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"We visited this place on an afternoon. It was not crowded, but there were lots of people. It was interesting to walk around the stairs and take a look down."
,,Disappointing...go to the Botanic Garden for free instead!,1.0,,"We were so disappointed with the Cloud Forest. There is only one thing to see, a great big rainfall.
Instead visit the Botanic Gardens for free. Such an amazing walk around a beautiful park, with little eateries and cafes along the way ( to get out of the heat for a while). I would recommend paying the $5 to see the Orchid Gardens. Absolutely breathtaking. So many to see, so many varieties and colours."
,,Amazing,5.0,,You are able to go right up to the top of the waterfall by lift and walk about in canopy amongst the plants on a walkway.
,,Most incredible Botanical Experience,5.0,,"It can be a stand alone experience in Gardens By The Bay, for the Cloud Forest is more than a walk. There are carniverous plants to entertain the children, beautiful orchids, weird plants collected from around the tropical mountains of the world and a thrill rider in a lift and escalators. It's more than you think!"
,,Great waterfall,3.0,,"To me the best part of this was the waterfall and the wood carved animals.
However, being inside the dome makes you wonder if we can truly live indoors without ever having to go outside into the elements. The dome is all about climate change education."
,,pretty cool,4.0,,"this place has an awesome environment. the cool air and plants make it look very cool. there is very much to look at.
it’s really cool for families and or friends.
there is also a couple of sky walks (not too high) in the rainforest-like area. this is a really nice view to see all of the plants in the area"
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,The Cloud Forest was the perfect place to spend a very hot afternoon. My family loved the waterfall and the different types of plants throughout the dome.
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"There are two modern impressive greenhouses in Garden by the Bay, and Cloud forest is even more impressive than the other one. Definitely worth a visit, together with a walk in the garden. Plan at least an hour."
,,Must in gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Cloud forest is one of the main attractions here. It’s a whole different experience with an artificial waterfall and the walk around it.

You will also get a nice view from the above floors of it, of the bay area as well as the cloud forest."
,,Lovely Forest,4.0,,Very well set out and a delight to spend a couple of hours there. Cool inside and many different viewing platforms.
,,Very nice greenhouses,4.0,,Loved the big greenhouse with the waterfall and the skywalk. So well done. The flower dome was a disappointment. It was full of Xmas trees and Disney figures. It completely ruined the dome for me.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"This place is amazing, it’s $28 to get into the cloud forest and flower dome. Cloud forest was our favourite, can be busy and we think it looks better if the sun is shining!"
,,great day out,5.0,,amazing place to visit fabulously informative & interesting great vision & position must see attraction
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,What a great exoerience we had at the cloud forrest dome. The multistory waterfall was awesome. We are plant lovers so the displays of the various plants were stunning. When climbing higher the views all around were of the virtual trees and the magnificent singapore harbour with many boats waiting their turnto dock. Would thoroughly reccomend.
,,Nothing compares to this!,5.0,,"It's huge, it's almost overwhelming in its size. Plan on spending more time that you would consider because there is a great deal to see."
,,An Architectural and Engineering Marvel,5.0,,It was as if we were brought to another plane of imagination when we entered the Cloud forest after our flower dome tour. The giant falls and the mist gave us a real feel of the joy of being in a forest . It elevated our sense of appreciation for Nature . The winding path on the other hand gave us a reality check as it gave us the perfect view if MBS and Singapore City. Don’t Miss this attraction.
,,Amazing,5.0,,You do this as part of the gardens by the bay tour.. This is a hanging garden with waterfalls. You go up with an elevator and walk down a looped path... A truly awesome experience not to be missed.
,,Unbelieveable,5.0,,I had heard so much about the Cloud gardens I really was not looking forward to going. How wrong I was - definitely a not to be missed experience. The gardens are magnificent.
,,"EXCELLENT, AUTHENTIC AND RELAXING",5.0,,It is so refreshing that such beauty can be created to reflect nature in such pleasing and refreshing way. Best times to go is outside of the busy holiday periods to avoid the crowds.
,,Nice experience,4.0,,This massive green house simulates a rain forest environment with a waterfall and plants from different parts of the world. The highlight is the carnivorous plants located on the top floor.
,,Must visit,5.0,,Quite an experience to visit cloud forest. A place to enjoy learning about unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests.
,,So Cool,4.0,,"Genius! excited to explore inside of the masterpiece, there is almost surprising in the next corner and the explore is full of WOW!"
,,Beautiful Display,5.0,,This very pretty pavilion encapsulates various types of tropical forest environments. The gardens flow from one to another winding up a center tower. A dramatic waterfall cascading from the top of the tower greets guests.
,,Wow,5.0,,"This place is amazing, and the first thing you see as you enter sets the standard ... it's a beautifully tall waterfall."
,,In the clouds,4.0,,A 6 storey structure that attempts to replicate temperate or high altitude flora. The skybridge is also a nice way to enjoy the site
,,Family Trip,4.0,,Had so much fun with my family. All the efforts and time are really worth it. Keep it up and keep it clean.
,,Pricey and Disappointing,2.0,,"A huge waterfall greets you as you enter and then you wander among non-descript gardens. Maybe I had seen too many other places with more interesting flora by the time I got here, but I would pass this up."
,,Genius,5.0,,I was not prepared for what greeted me as I walked through the doors - simply breathtaking. The ecosystem created within the air conditioned dome was a pleasant surprise
,,Gardens By The Bay.,5.0,,The cloud forest is part of Gardens By The Bay. The gardens are free but The Cloud Forest and the other exhibit cost $28. Well worth it.
,,Multi level experience,5.0,,"Had great fun in here, about 5 levels with excellent views of surrounding areas, the waterfall was quite spectacular for an indoor one"
,,So cool,5.0,,"And I do mean ""cool."" It was about 90 degrees outside, but inside the dome it was so nice and cool.
The waterfall is fantastic, the crowds are not. If I were to return to Singapore, I would try to visit this place early in the morning on a weekday."
,,Enjoy the mountain greens,3.0,,"The concept of cloud forest is to grow plants and trees available on the various mountain of the world. I liked the artificial waterfall, cold breeze and rare plants such as pitcher plant.
It needs about two hours to visit. You will get many photo opportunities. The whole setup is the fruit of great human efforts and dreams to create an impossible terrain.

Tips
* If possible, try to get the audio tour guide.
* waiting time is almost negligible.
* spend more time near the fall."
,,Realistic waterfall,5.0,,"Fantastic view of the waterfall. Walking the elevated platform was like walking above the cloud on the mountain top. Good for family outing while enjoying the ""nature"""
,,Enjoyable,3.0,,"Visited both the domes when we were in the Gardens by the Bay. Loved the cloud gardens, worth a visit"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This is well worth a couple hours of your time in Singapore. Wander through and marvel at the foliage, which is dramatically organized and presented. I believe an audio tour is available, though I would have appreciated more explanatory signage for those of us not interested in the audio tour. But it's one of a few experiences in Singapore that is not to be missed. As a bonus, it's nice and cool inside!"
,,Indoor waterfall with mesmerizing experience,5.0,,"Huge indoor waterfall. Suggest you to take lift go to top floor and then start coming down enjoying glimpse of each floor. Each floor is having some or other unique theme and display so don't miss them.
This is inside gardens by the bay and chargeable. U can opt for chargeable tram which will drop u at the dome. Flower dome/supergrove trees are next to it so u can enjoy that too."
,,Beautiful displays,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit here very much. Very well laid out with lovely plants, flowers and displays to view."
,,An Amazing Spectacle,5.0,,Love the construction of this dome and how it is all put together. A scenic time providing a great experience.
,,Interesting Indoor Rain Forest,4.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but overall I enjoyed the experience. You take an elevator to the top and then work your way down through the rain forest via paths that sometimes have you elevated above the floor. It was a nice break from the heat."
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"I went there by a friend's recommendation and I wasn't disappointed at all. I was awestruck by the entire set up, one of the world's tallest artificial indoor waterfall, flora-fauna and the cloud walk. The theatre show cases a short film and crystal formations are must visit."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to the cloud forest. The building is huge! and so is the waterfall inside! Had great fun walking the walkway above/around the giant waterfall. Walkway may be a little scary for those scared of heights.
,,Cloud Nine at the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Perpetual blooms. The perfect eden. Waterfalls and water mist, magical. The sight, the scenery and the scent of the Cloud Forest leaves me spell bound. I could picture Adam and Even there in their fig leaf finery. Cooing, Cuddling. Crooning paens of love.

In the concrete jungle of Singapore, marked by pockets of green, the Cloud Forest stands majestic and enticing. I was awed. I was called. I was taken by sublime surprise.

The flora and fauna collection there was impressive in scope and breath, in variations and volume. It is simply the best man made Forest I have seen and experienced ever.

If there is one place that a Singapore tourist must include in one’s bucket, it is a trip to the Cloud Forest. Be there. Watch and learn about hiow easy it is to appreciate nature and how fast it is to just destroy it.

I was more than happy I visited the Cloud Forest. It is a Cloud nine experience at its best!"
,,calm and cool,5.0,,calm and cool and quite relaxing. lots of flowers to look at and enjoy. it was busy but not overly crowed you never felt rushes nor you being bumped into constantly
,,So interesting,5.0,,"Brilliant, loved it, was so interesting and spent much longer in here than I thought I would. Would definitely recommend."
,,"Just one part, although an important part, of Gardens by the Bay",5.0,,"The Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome are the two parts of the immense Gardens by the Bay that you actually have to pay an entrance fee for, but well, well worth it. The cloud forest presents a winding pathway that takes you up and up through varying ecosystems, all done with exquisite beauty. Don't neglect the rest of the Gardens, though, and not just the Supertrees!"
,,A vertical garden,4.0,,"It's a fun attraction with surprising amount of content in the small space. You can take the cloud walk or go to the top with the elevator. There's a wide variety of plants along the way, a waterfall and an exhibition about climate education."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Amazing experience! Would certainly go here again and again! Do go up the cloud walk! I spent 2 hours here and felt like it wasn’t enough!
,,Stunning Attraction with wonderful Flora,5.0,,From the moment you enter and head past the giant man made waterfall this place is serene and beautiful. After a lap of the lower level you rise up six floors to the top of the dome and walk down on carefully built catwalks into differing climates and types of flora. This is a wonderful and in my mind must see attraction.
,,A sensational experience,5.0,,"I loved it here. The biodiversity, the architecture, the waterfall, the climate change education, the entire experience."
,,A world of wonder,5.0,,"The cloud forest is a majestic conservatory with various biomes for high-altitude flora, and an enormous waterfall by the entrance. You'll be entranced by the views, and the signs tell of the how and why behind it. One ticket usually covera both the cloud forest and the adjacent flower dome."
,,So Unique,5.0,,Such a different experience for us. Amazing to be inside such a structure with real live plants growing and the amazing waterfall. Loved how you can walk around on the sky trail. Refreshing temperature inside too to cool you down after walking around outside.
,,Spectacular beyond belief!,5.0,,"Pretty certain I walk around this dome saying wow over and over again. So beautiful, so intricate and takes your breath away with each step."
,,wide variety of plants,4.0,,it is a place that is vastly different from most places in Singapore as it has a wide variety of plants which cannot be found in other parts of sg! would suggest tourists to head down to this place to have a look especially with the waterfall.
,,Best of the attactions here,5.0,,Found this better than flower dome butbits all one ticket I think. Easy walk down from the top and interesting plants on display. Plenty of orchids and the magnified ones different
,,We enjoyed it immensely!,5.0,,"Went with my mother to the Cloud Forrest, it is absolutely stunning! Luckily we took the buggy package and were driven to the domes from near the metro station. When we came out we were a little confused about our location and where we could enter the other dome, but it was probably just us not the signage etc.
Highly recommend!"
,,Wondrous garden,5.0,,"This feature in Singapore is not to be missed. It has history displays, waterfalls, beautifully arranged plants, excitement for children, a glass dome that kept us dry in the heavy downpours, and is well organized. While a walk up to the top is best, a lift will also take seniors and pushchairs to the top. Photo ops galore. Gorgeous vegetation over concrete structure. Huge Arturium plants. Wholly impressive. Reasonable entrance fee. Less if you can prove you flew in by Singapore Airlines!"
,,Another manmade waterfall in Singapore,4.0,,Another man made tens tall waterfall in Singapore with amazing gardens arrangement and stunning multi sky ways inside a massive glass house. You should visit here!
,,Visually Stunning,5.0,,Cloud Forest is as majestic as its name suggests. A waterfall introduces you to a beautiful scenery and can keep you mesmerized for hours! A must-see for first time visitors! :)
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is one of two domes in the Gardens by the Bay and it is just stunning. At the entrance you are met with a waterfall and as you continue to walk throughout the dome you are met an astounding variety of plants. You can take a lift to the top of the dome and get a magnificent view of inside of the dome. The walk down is also pretty amazing. You have to pay (very reasonable) to enter the dome but it is well worth it.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"I am basically a sweaty dude so this is the perfect place for me as the waterfall immediately cools me down after I have walked the exterior of Garden By the Bay which is under the sun. The walk to the top of the waterfall is impressive and the cooling effect overwhelms me more than the flora since I am not a really botanic expert. However, you do notice that there are many plants and trees which you would not get to see during normal days over there. For me, the cooling “mountainous climate” is worth your visit"
,,A must see,5.0,,"The building is amazing in itself, let alone the plants. There are several ""fly traps"" made out of leggo which are just a great draw-card for children. There is a lift to the top of the building or you can walk if you want a good workout. Waterfalls, stalagmites fabulous plants are integrated into one building. The walkway down is suspended yet you feel so safe. This is truely amazing and I wouldnt have missed it for the world."
,,Water of life,5.0,,"Just to walk through a waterfall is an amazing experience. The sounds, smells and taste of refreshing air and touches of water is a once in a lifetime experience. Here is another example of the recovery of land from the sea and how useful it is.
There is an audio track telling the story all the time. Showing the use of water and Singapore. You can look at plants, trees and food all made possible from the capture of water.
You will not regret taking time to come here as the Cloud Forest experience will never be forgotten."
,,hours walking,3.0,,"The gardens is a nice well run tourist area. Reminds me of Disney. Its very expensive and just to many visitors for me. You may want to pay for a shuttle ride on site. It cost 28 dollars just for the Flower Dome. I didn't expect the tremendous noisy situation inside? Nature outdoors, you know a somewhat peaceful area. Not so! It's not a pleasant place. It's a mob of people wanting their selfies. Cloud forest had a 20 min. waiting time just to inter. I would guess being indoors makes the noise worse? Definitely check best times to visit. It was actually chaotic at times with kids screaming and running everywhere?"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"This is a must visit when you are in Singapore. Absolutely stunning, many different types of plants and flowers. Nice and cool inside. Can get a bit crowded but worth it. I think it’s around $15 to visit one or $25 for both."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"The water will, at first sight will take your breath away. The engineering is impressive! Great videos to explain need for conservation of forest for future generations. It's cold inside. So carry a shawl or jacket."
,,Wondrous garden,5.0,,"This feature in Singapore is not to be missed. It has history displays, waterfalls, beautifully arranged plants, excitement for children, a glass dome that kept us dry in the heavy downpours, and is well organized. While a walk up to the top is best, a lift will also take seniors and pushchairs to the top. Photo ops galore. Gorgeous vegetation over concrete structure. Huge Arturium plants. Wholly impressive. Reasonable entrance fee. Less if you can prove you flew in by Singapore Airlines!"
,,Another manmade waterfall in Singapore,4.0,,Another man made tens tall waterfall in Singapore with amazing gardens arrangement and stunning multi sky ways inside a massive glass house. You should visit here!
,,Visually Stunning,5.0,,Cloud Forest is as majestic as its name suggests. A waterfall introduces you to a beautiful scenery and can keep you mesmerized for hours! A must-see for first time visitors! :)
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is one of two domes in the Gardens by the Bay and it is just stunning. At the entrance you are met with a waterfall and as you continue to walk throughout the dome you are met an astounding variety of plants. You can take a lift to the top of the dome and get a magnificent view of inside of the dome. The walk down is also pretty amazing. You have to pay (very reasonable) to enter the dome but it is well worth it.

,,Indoor Beauty,4.0,,Appropriate for anyone. Kids friendly. You don't have to worry about the weather for once. Airconditioned and sheltered. Do take care of your belongings during the festive period. Expected to be crowded.
,,Fantastic evening shiw,5.0,,"I would advise giving yourself at least 3 hours to visit everything as there are 2 indoor exhibitions as well as the outside gardens and the cloud forest. Make sure you are there for the evening light show it is truly superb. You can do a walk through the cloud forest but beware if you don't like heights, the same for the indoor exhibition with the waterfall the walk in there is also really high up."
,,Walking in the cloud!,5.0,,"I have to say that I love walking around in cloud Forest it was beautiful with a lot of different flowers, trees and an amazing tropical environment the pathway around the forest was breathtaking. You started on floor six and walked your way down. The flower doom next to cloud Forrest was not worth the money (at least not in December). The also offered a shuttle service from the MRT station which made it convenient in the rain."
,,A must do,5.0,,A visit to the city must include this attraction. It is very well presented. We went ealry in the day and managed to avoid the lines that were there later. Very well presented attraction.

,,Feeling in the forest,5.0,,"This is a second time to visit this forest, although Singapore don't have any cool climate forest, but at least got a man made forest in the city. You cal feel water mist to cool you, flowers and plants to sooth you, and birds singing sound to clear your busy minds. What a amazing forest in the cityscape. Especially the walking bridge to let you feel the height. Really cool."
,,Singapore,5.0,,Greenery in a glass green house. Amazing Experience One of the best place to spend time with your family.
,,Singapore's Cloud Forrest is all built inside a building,5.0,,"As with all sites along Singapore's Marina Gardens, The Cloud Forrest is a marvel to view. There is so much to see and do in the forest that you might want to spend hours"
,,Nothing Else Like It Truly Unique,5.0,,"I have been to the Cloud Forest many times but never tire of wandering around and taking in this amazing place. Each time you return it’s slightly different so never boring.
I would recommend this in the TOP five places to bring someone new to Singapore"
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,The cloud forest is a very interesting place to visit. You can feel beeing in a rain forest and walk in the trees and on top of them. Lots of trees and flowers.

,,A very cool place to visit and enjoy the scenery.,5.0,,Rarely can stand so near to the a waterfall and absorbing cool refreshing water sprays in a hot tropical climate. The gardens offers different themes from many countries it was European flowers then now it is Japanese. Great for photography.
,,Air conditioned multi level walk,4.0,,"One of two cooled domes by the Gardens by the Bay. This dome recreates the tropical climate with fauna and flora, and a spectacular indoor waterfall, with walks at different levels.

It is a lovely way to spend an hour, especially if hot outside. We wore sweaters as we did feel chilly."
,,Enjoyed it again !!,5.0,,"Again a real pleasure to visit the Cloud Forest. Beautiful design to give the opportunity to see the grow of a lot of different plants. Also new visit corners were created with plants, lego's ,.... A great pleasure!!"

,,"Absolutely a must for botany, but bring a jacket",4.0,,"Brought my mum because she just loves gardening, but I was bored. Nice photo ops and fantastic air conditioning, perfect for blazing hot days.

Bring a jacket if you don't tolerate the cold well else you'll be sweating outside and freezing inside. Unless you come from temperate country, then you'll feel right at home."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A cascading waterfall upon entry, the Cloud Forest was a beautiful atrium of mutli-tiered walkways and views across lucious greenery and the Marina Bay skyline. If it were a selection between the Gardens and the Cloud Forest my personal selection would be the Forest, absolutely breathtaking."

,,Amazing Views Day & Night,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the two giant greenhouses at Gardens by the Bay, with the other dome being the Flower Dome. Upon entering the Cloud Forest, you will be greeted by the towering man-made waterfall. You will make your way round up the waterfall, enjoying the various fauna. The views from the top of the waterfall were great, and you'll have a walk along the bridge, giving you a great view of the Marina Bay area.

You can get a re-entry stamp on your arms for the same day. Do visit this place again at night as the waterfall will be lighted up with different colours."
,,Instagrammable moments in the clouds,5.0,,"The idea of a cloud forest comes to life the moment you walk in the forest enclosure. Reasonable prices, easily accessible and a wonderful concept for those plants that thrive in a high moisture environment. It cools you down on a hot day with the water spray from the water fall. As you climb to see the plants close up you eventually get to the top and get a close up of the super trees again. Yes, I am obsessed with the concept. The plants look so healthy and seem to be so well cared for it was a pleasure to spend time here. Highly recommended too."
,,Still awesome to visit,5.0,,Its my second time to visit Cloud Forest. Enjoyed it veru much. Took friend this time. They loved the place. Bring a Jacket when going here.

,,Excellent,5.0,,This is an indoor forest. It has a waterfall as you enter and a lift to the top. You make your way down via an amazing walkway while looking at all the variety of plants in a forest. The views of Singapore from this place are stunning as well. Go during the day when there is plenty of sunlight.
,,A high experience,4.0,,We decided to pay extra to go into this Dome. It was cold and damp and beautiful. It has been done in a very imaginative way with a wonderful array of plants. We climbed right to the top and then you come down to different levels. Wonderful but not for anyone who does not like heights. Worth a visit.
,,Fairy tale garden,5.0,,"One of the main attractions at Gardens By the Bay, Singapore, and personal favourite out of the two. Very chilly attraction so bring a jacket. Also a very beautiful place so bring a phone or camera because the scenery is truly magnificent. Perfect for pictures or just for walks with your friends/family/significant other."
,,Got Chill!!,5.0,,"I came from a state in India that is called ""the abode of Clouds"" and to see the creation of the mist of clouds in Cloud Forest is an amzing experience. Great Work!!!"
,,Im in love with it,5.0,,"Im in love for the place becz Its dam dam beautiful and amazingly fresh air , you actually feel the difference of fresh air"

,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,Well designed and delicately arranged so many rare and beautiful flowers within this huge magnificent dome!
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,The cloud forest is a great way to get out of the heat and enjoy the beautiful scenery. The cloud forest allows you to walk through the waterfall with different levels of flowers and plants everywhere. I recommend going at 9am to avoid mass amounts of people and to get the best photos! Such a great experience for $15 with beautiful views it’s well worth the trip.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This is a very beautiful place with different types of flowers. The waterfall is very refreshing considering the heat.
,,A fantastic forest in the City! Very cold though.,5.0,,"The old and young in the family all love it, and couples love it too. The kids love running around the bridges, looks dangerous but fun. The grandparents enjoy the air/walking/crystal display so much. For old and young, make sure bringing a jacket cos it gets really cold, especially on rainy days. It's wheelchair friendly, amazing and super considerate design."
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"It was threatening to rain so we sought cover, paid our $15 and entered one of the best experiences we found in Singapore. Worth every penny, a real feat of engineering, gardening and imagination."
,,beautiful gardens,4.0,,"this was definitley the best of the two domes, the waterfall is great as is the walking platform which takes you to the top of the dome, beautiful planting and lovely atmosphere"
,,Unbelievable.,5.0,,"There should be more similar creations in other countries around the world, to relax and promote calm. The layout, colours and variety of plants make a superb display for any body to observe and enjoy."
,,"Most amazing ""Glasshouse"".",5.0,,"All part of, ""Gardens by the Bay"", and full of beautiful flowers, amazing waterfalls and huge trees. This place really is amazing, considering all the trees, some of which are VERY large, have all been imported from true jungle. this place really will stretch your imagination, as to what can be created."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Absolutely stunning visit much more than we expected. Just the most interesting and well designed display I have ever seen. Highly recommended
,,Cloud Forest at Singapore,5.0,,"We got there for 9.00am entry to beat the crowds, and this worked a treat, we had the place to ourselves and got some great photos before the place got busy.
The domes are fabulous, and air conditioned, they are better than even the Eden Project in England which we visited a few years ago.
This is absolutely a must see if you are visiting Singapore, and is very inexpensive."
,,Lovely place to spend a few hours,5.0,,Very interesting and nice to see. At first sight through the main doors your initial first though is definitely ‘wow’. An impressive feat of architecture
,,Must definitely not be missed,5.0,,One of the best experiences we had in Singapore. one can spend hours here. It is beautifully created and and we had an excellent time walking through the dome.
,,Fabulous and should not be missed,5.0,,"If you love gardens or simply want a great walk among a mountain rainforest environment do not miss this one. Ignore the signs saying you buy tickets to both this dome and the flower dome and just ask for a single ticket to the cloud dome. Or do both, but don't fell you have to. Takes about 2 hours to do it properly and look for the interesting sculptures using old tree trunks. Try to get there earl as the clouds/mist started to disappear when more people entered."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Best to travel there by taxi which drops you off at the door. A must see, loved the beautiful flowers and cascading waterfalls. The garden's are amazing and well worth going to the Satay restaurant in the food court located the other side of the children's water park."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning! An entire eco system and climate created under a roof... Well worth a visit, and a lot of fun. There is also a brilliant video experience at the end where you can learn a lot about the effects of global warming and what you can do to help save our planet."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,So worth a visit. The sheer size of the structure is amazing to see. The dome is cool and easy to get around with lifts to get up and down for those with trouble walking. The views are fantastic also.

,,Fabulous,5.0,,Worth every penny. We loved the visit and will recommend to friends. I’d come again if I’m in Singapore in the future. We had a great couple of hours
,,Cool place to view the flowers,5.0,,"The air-conditioned dome out of the 2 domes in Gardens by the Bay, take a walk on the high bridge that snakes around the dome. Catch a respite from the hot weather in Singapore and cool yourself by the waterfall in the dome."
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,"Great for a slow stroll, view all the different types of plants and hidden sculptures. There is a timed 'spraying'/'steaming' of the could forest, which looks so pretty if you get to see it. The could forest is disabled friendly as I was able to get my grandad around in his wheel chair, there are lifts inside the structure and he was even able to go out on the high walkways."
,,cloud and forest! wow!,5.0,,the cloud forest in one of the domes at garden by the bay is an amazing concept! you are literally inside the cloud forest going around it. this is a must visit along with night laser show. near to mrt system.
,,Fantastic flora!,5.0,,"Located next to the flower dome ($28 Singapore for both domes) a fantastic waterfall greets you into this dome before you follow the path that meanders around the collection of natures wonders with some amazing sculptures too that enhance the experience .There is a sky walk within the dome that gives you great views both inside and outside of the dome (big wherl,f1 pit lane) for some great photo opportunities."
,,Just wow,5.0,,"As two people who love our garden this was just a delight and we would happily have gone round again if we could. The waterfall is staggering, the planting is luxuriant and the experience is unique."
,,Beautiful tropical Garden,5.0,,"Well worth the price, take your time going through the cloud dome, so many different, beautiful plants."
,,The garden of the future,5.0,,"I have never experienced something as unique as this. The cloud forest is a cooled, indoor, multi tiered garden that provides you with an excellent view of the surrounding area which includes: Gardens by the bay, and the bay itself. I completely recommend visiting this place! It's a jog in a forest in Singapore except you don't need sunscreen, umbrellas, bug spray, and all the things you would need in a normal stroll outdoors in this country."
,,Beautiful and Educational,5.0,,"A lovely garden respite from bustling Singapore. Cool and refreshing. Beautiful plants. Lots of information. Of particular interest is the section giving information on climate change. Be sure to have lunch or a snack at the food center. Delicious food, quite a variety, very reasonable prices."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"This was my favorit in whole Gardens by the Bay. Ticket is for both glas domes (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome), and both are interesting."
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a must see in Singapore. It’s just amazing. As soon as you come out from the hot heat of Singapore into Clouds bay it feels so coooool and relaxing. Breathing just fresh air was really good
There are just so many things to see in there. It costs about 16SGD for just the clouds forest or 28SGD to enter the cloud forest as well as flower dome.
A lot of greenery and many kind of flowers can be seen here.
You get go all the way to the top where you can see plants made out of legos, you have the carnivorous plants and great views of the city as well. There are some waterfall as well. Towards the end of the cloud forest there are many videos and signs up on ways to protect the environment which is very useful and a reminder to people not to ruin our planet.
Definitely recommended."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,This place is a must see. I feel like my lungs decongested and filtrate just by breathing the clean air there. The waterfall and all plants are mind blowing. Make sure you buy tickets for both forest and gardens as they are cheaper together. I’d definitely go back.
,,Amaazing,5.0,,"The concept of a tropical forest set around a mountain with flowers, palms, tress, orchids and much more is an experience.

Take the lift to the top and gradually descend through the magical spaces looking down from meandering ramps.

Views through the dome to the bay are also spectacular.

When leaving the mountain the educational experience was a great surprise and continued the learning experience about how important the Forrest’s are and how they contribute to the global eco system - the visit was a spectacular experience.

If you purchase the double ticket for the Bay Gardens Dome as well then I would recommend visiting the Forrest second which will be the icing on the cake.

A must do experience and you can still visit the Gardens free and see the Super Trees."
,,UNIQUE CREATION,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is a truly beautiful and unique creation is a variety of plants arranged around a huge structure with a waterfall cascading down. Definitely worth visiting.
,,If you love plants this is the place to be,5.0,,"An air-conditioned waterfall inside a dome, one just cant imagine this but yes this is true, a place with tons of plants from around the world. An important piece of advice would be wear some warm clothes before entering the cloud dome its really bone chilling inside the dome"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Seriously feels like you are in an Avatar movie. Amazing nature all around and the waterfall is a must see!
,,Great Display,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is arguably the top display within Gardens by the Bay and is a ""must"" to see attraction."
,,A must see Whilst in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a place all who have the time should visit whilst in Singapore.
One of the most spectaculat plant collections one could imagine , a gardeners paradise.
You can spends hours in here without realising.
A credit to the creator and all who continue to maintain same"
,,Climate Controlled Oasis,4.0,,Admission is not cheap but worth a visit. Plants from all over the world arranged by region. Impressive displays. The place is climate controlled. A nice relieve from the sweltering heat of Singapore. Expect to spend 2 to 3 hours here. The centerpiece Waterfall is amazing.
,,City Waterfall,5.0,,"Cool place, thousands of plants, big insect-eating plants and a great waterfall! we went there late to combine it with the light and sound show in Gardens by the Bay. It was quite crowded that time. So do better: they open 9 am, go there early and and enjoy with much fewer people. get a stamp on your hand when leaving for a free entry later the day."
,,Exceptional,5.0,,This is a great venue to visit and the walk to the top through all the waterfalls and trees was amazing. Better that I had expected and would recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore
,,A must when visiting Singapore,5.0,,Amazing place to visit. Most of our time spent at gardens by the bay was at the cloud forest. Its a must specially getting at the top floor and checking the whole thing. Also great for taking photos.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"It was one of my favorites at the gardens and very well kept. I'd choose this over the other garden. My husband and I were both entertained and its very different from any other one we have seen, organization wise as well as display. I loved it!"
,,BEAUTIFUL!,5.0,,Wow! The waterfalls are so cool and the flowers are so pretty! Cool air-con too. The Tree Top Walk and Cloud Walk are amazing and the views from top are mind-blowing! Thank you for making the Cloud Forest!
,,I really enjoyed this visit,5.0,,"Cloud Forest was something unique and it hits you as soon as you enter. Upon entering, you are staring at the massive waterfall. The atmosphere is cool (not as hot as outside) but humid (It is a cloud forest, after all).

The set up is smart but will likely involve quite a queue. Head to the elevators to go up to the top, then walk down to explore the whole forest. The view from above is really cool and the displays are interesting. It really gives you some ideas of what you could do at your own home in your hard.

Probably spend about 2 hours here."
,,nice experience,5.0,,unique how they actually did build all the plants on a mountain..I loved the predatory plants exhibition on the top. the bridge is also amazing as well.
,,Amazing Site and Sights,4.0,,The plants of different species in different elevations gives us an elated feeling- the wonder of a conducive and friendly environment under controlled and well managed environment.
,,Beautiful place and well maintained,5.0,,Beautiful place and well maintained. Natural beauty under a closed environment. Exceptional good. Must visit place in Singapore
,,must visit,4.0,,"very nice place to visit if you love nature, everything is well maintained! Absolutely enjoyed myself here :)"
,,Don't miss!,5.0,,"If you have not problems with walking to heights, you will really enjoy thisspecatular biosphere of plants at great heights!"
,,Wow! You need to visit when in Singapore it’s a must see.,5.0,,Over six stories of magnificent gardens to wander through. Give yourself time to enjoy being there you need at least an hour.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"This was amazing! After walking around the base we took an elevator to the top then walked back down around and in and out of the waterfall. Beautiful plants, also wood sculptures of animals that at first glance looked like pieces of driftwood. Definitely a must see!"
,,Go visit,4.0,,"Very good, fun and great architecture. Good for families and kids! Take a few hours and go explore. Educational, beautiful and interesting."
,,Wow,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the Cloud Forest Dome. The tall water fall was lovely. The design was amazing. We wandered around and upwards admiring the incredibly diverse plants. The carved seating was amazing. My daughter couldn't stop photographing the orchids. They even had Ice/Rock formations ( sorry, forgot what they were). The views looking out were incredible. It never felt too crowded because there was so much space. The walk ways were lovely. If you only see 1 Dome, see this one!"
,,Very pleasant stroll,5.0,,Very pleasant way to spend an hour or so but go early before it gets too crowded with selfie sticks.
,,"Great, a must see!",5.0,,"Paying SGD 28 per person for admission to Cloud Forest and Flower Dome (re-entry allowed, too) was well worth.

Cloud Forest is one of the two indoor cooled conservatoires of Gardens by the Bay. Misting occurs at regular intervals (10am, 12 noon, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm and the last at 8pm). I went straight up to the highest level of the Cloud Forest with my family and then began to descend down the ""Cloud Walk"", experiencing the different attractions at different levels.

There's a miniature waterfall as well. Spring Garden or something by the name of it is a recent addition to the dome.

There's a show also that talks about the need to conserve environment, in addition to a gallery showcasing the harmful effects of climate change and human predication on the earth. Quite scary, actually. It reminds each and every tourist-local alike to be a responsible citizen and person.

Definitely recommend this attraction!"
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,Beautiful waterfall and lovely peaceful area combined with the flower dome it was a lovely visit and outside at night the grounds were all lit up with changing colours
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Visited as part of a trip to Gardens by the Bay. We were initially unsure whether to pay the domes entrance fees but very glad we did. The emphasis in the Cloud Forest is on what can be done with a mass of plants to truly stunning effect (unlike the Flower Dome which focuses on the variety of different plants). The dome is misty so expect it to be quite cool. Overall it's hard to describe - it is simply a plant wall, but the effect is breathtaking and not to be missed."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex in Singapore. The complex consists of four parts - a series of outdoor gardens which are free, the Domed Cloud Forest and the domed Flower Dome, and the elevated walkway in the outdoor gardens near the Supertrees. Of these, the Cloud Forest was my favorite. We spend about 3 hours in this dome. It is designed to be a rain forest. There is a waterfall upon entry, then a series of walkways. You walk behind and eventually above the waterfall. There are lots of plants and statues and carvings. Bring your camera as there seems to be a picture worthy view around almost every corner. This is a great thing to do on a rainy day since it is ""indoors"". The admission fee is reasonable and discount tickets are available from some tour operators. There is an SMRT station near the gardens so getting to and from by mass transit is easy. Don't miss this one."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,This was the better of the two domes. An experience worth having. Brilliant for family aesthetic pictures.
,,Largest dome in the world.,5.0,,Almost big enough to have its own climate. You walk through the first few levels but then have to take an elevator to the top to walk gradually back down on hanging walkways. Its really spectacular and worth waiting for. We’ve been to over 100 countries and there is nothing else in the world like it.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Well maintained garden. Mainly Amazon based Flora. Walkable distance from MRT. entry fee is 35 Singapore dollars. You need to pay extra 5 dollars if you use tram .
,,Heaven,5.0,,You must keep at least 3 to 4 hrs aside to enjoy the walk and come prepared with the best camera and lenses you have. We came here with a toddler and were happy to find all required facilities for babies.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Quite an amazing experience - not sure there are too many places in the world that can compare to the Cloud Forest in Singapore.
Incredible what the'ye managed to achieve in what is essentially one giant greenhouse complete with waterfalls and all manner of flora.
Words don't really to it justice - if you time is limited in Singapore this should be at or near the top of your must see list."
,,Well worth the entry fee,5.0,,"This was a great experience. The cloud forest was not only an amazing man-made forest, complete with waterfall and a great variety of orchids (among other things), it is also several degrees cooler than outside. Highly recommend."
,,Fab day out,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit with beautiful displays, lots of great information and a fantastic indoor waterfall. Highly recommended a visit here if in Singapore"
,,Welcome to the jungle,5.0,,"Really nice place, you feel like you are in the jungle! There are different floors with beautiful views"
,,amazing atmosphere and structure,5.0,,"Great place to get around and explore the beauty of nature with full of flowers vegetation, an amazing indoor waterfall"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,3 generations of my family had a afternoon here at the Cloud forest. We all loved it emensly. The kids and I found it very educational and worthwhile. It is definitely the highlight of the Gardens for us. The artwork throughout was well placed and very talented. The videos and info area was extremely interesting.
,,The highlight of our Singapore trip,5.0,,This place is like a Christopher Nolan movie dream sequence. Seems unreal way too often. You have to go here just to experience how surreal nature often is.
,,Cool Forest,4.0,,The whole Forest was cool in temp and made visiting. Very pleasant one. Enjoyed the walk on the bridge the most.
,,What an amazing place,5.0,,"The plants, the waterfall, the views, the horticulture involved in this feat! You must go - and watch for a surprise at every turn."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Advise, bring a jacket. It is freezing in the Cloud forest. What a well planned and visually stunning place. Go early to miss the crowds. Unfortunately if you go early you miss the night lights. You can go back in the evening."
,,What an experience,5.0,,"Make sure you do this on your visit to Singapore, so worth it especially at night. The waterfall is amazing."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Considering the gardens are free to get in this is more than worth paying the entrance fee to get in so much work has gone into the structure great for all ages such a fascinating experience
,,Joy and lots of joy,5.0,,"Very refreshing and excellently designed and maintained. Displays provide not only beutiful sight but knowledge as well. A place loved by young, old and kids alike. Keep lots of time at your disposal when visiting. Do not miss the light and sound show in the evening which is free."
,,Indoor forest with a huge waterfall,5.0,,What an amazing place! You can spend hours walking here. Entry fee is only 28 Singaporean dollars ( this will let you also enter the Flower Dome ). Temperature is very cool and pleasant. You can enjoy the views from the skywalk and also many walkways amongst the beautiful tropical vegetation.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"You shouldn’t miss this if you are visiting Singapore....the line up can be a bit long, but we went around supper time and it was not an issue. They state line up lengths of time so you know what you are in for. The structure is amazing!"
,,A fun way to spend an hour or so,5.0,,"An interesting place to visit - you get the lift to the top and then meander down around the walkways; looks like you'd be queuing for a bit at busy times, but was fine on our weekday afternoon visit."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Oasis in the hustle of Singapore... great experience - see my other review of Gardens By The Bay for more details.
,,It’s a must,5.0,,It exceeded all my expectations for me I could have passed on the flower dome and just gone to the cloud forest even with vertigo I enjoyed it
,,Flowers and shrubs under one Glass Dome,5.0,,The waterfall is beautiful. Don't forget to go to top for Selfie. Mist in the air and the temperature is controlled.
,,Short break,4.0,,Well organised and didn’t feel too busy as we went around 5.30 in the evening. Has a very nice aerial walkway and a 6 storey waterfall. Lots to look at and very relaxing.
,,don't let the crowds put you off,4.0,,great place to spend a couple of hours in an afternoon I had as much fun people watching as looking at the displays
,,Beautiful but crowded,4.0,,Would recommend coming here early as when we arrived it was extremely crowded. Waited over 30 mins just for the elevator.
,,Just forest,3.0,,European type forest in middle of Singapore with some waterfalls and way too many people inside! Beware of guided groups with guide carrying flag.
,,Different from the rest of the garden,4.0,,Was a very different experience to walk through the mist and the water fall. Liked the display of carnivorous plants at the top.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,This is one of the two domes within Gardens by the Bay. You can buy tickets to enter both the domes which is recommended as both are quite different.
,,Best part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Best part of our visit to Gardens by the bay. $30 per adult for both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Flower Dome is not remotely as good as the Cloud Forest, so see if you can get a ticket for just one. 10% discount with Singapore Air boarding pass, I think. (We didn't have one.)"
,,on the second time - just the same...,4.0,,"came for the second time looking for some changes but not in this attraction. we came for the fog time - actually not special, the place need some better maintenance for the green mold growing. the water outlets looks artificial - can do better.
still a must see for 1 time as minimum"
,,A Must See attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"My wife and I visited this attraction after seeing the Super trees.
It starts with a great view of the huge waterfall at ground level. You then take the elevator to the top level and work your way down through stunning floral displays.
A bit disappointed to see imported stalagmites which were taken from elsewhere in the world and would have taken tens of thousands of years to form naturally. Completely unnecessary if you ask me."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Loved being there. Feels like a real mountain with waterfalls and mist and all kinds of plants. The top floor has pitcher plants and the venus fly trap!!
,,Amazing place,5.0,,We visited both day and night and I think the night visit was even more spectacular with all the lights twinkling.
,,Did not disappoint!,5.0,,This place lived up to the hype. Can get a bit crowed with all the families and kids. But if you catch a break you can get some great pics. The African sculptures really add some significant depth to the exhibit. From an architect perspective I was impressed. The water fall features were outstanding!
,,That rain forest feel,4.0,,Very clever set up that gives the impression you are in a rain forest with some stunning plants and scenery. Careful of cues to get to the top in the lifts if the stairs are inaccessible.
,,Cloud forest - Marina Gardens,5.0,,A place one should not miss at Singapore. Modern marvellous architecture. Will take one hour for the tour. Can see variety of plants.
,,Unique garden,4.0,,This dome in gardens by the bay is worth visiting...the coolness and the falls in the dome are attractive...the decorations too are more than what you expect...
,,A gorgeous afternoon wander,5.0,,"The cloud dome is the best dome in my opinion. Stepping in to the bottom of the super impressive waterfall and then climbing to the top of the mountain top only to wind down the outside again is magical. I love being at the top with the pool and all the pitcher plants. Take a cardigan though, it’s chilly in there!"
,,Wow! Beautiful dome,5.0,,First thing its COLD! Compared to outside. So if you are like me take a scarf with you. The waterfall is beautiful and the walk between all the flowers and plants is very nice. Loved the mini orchids!
,,What a pleasure,5.0,,"This is a real pleasure to discover the cloud forest: it is a bit chilly so it is better to dress accordingly, but the athmosphere really feels like a high forest mountains, the plants and the waterfall are amazing."
,,One to seee,5.0,,Don’t miss it. If you only have time see it. The rest of park is also nice but this is the jewel. So see it last
,,Indoor Waterfall - What more can I say,5.0,,"In the heart of the Gardens by the Bay... you will find this gem! It is a beautiful waterfall surrounded by what looks like a forest. It is a must see and can easily spend hours seeing it's true beauty. Great views of Gardens by the Bay and interesting facts shared about the environmentally friendly built garden, how they sustain it. There is factual information shared about how the environment is currently being affected and how it could affect the generations to come. A must see when visiting the gardens!"
,,Sightseeing,5.0,,"Awesome place, interesting layout with great information. Super. This is a great way to learn the interesting facts on cloud forests. The orchids were so beautiful."
,,Incredible - a must see!,5.0,,"It was beautiful and cool, photos don’t really do it justice. I loved it a lot more than I thought I would seeing it in person! An incredible mixture of waterfalls and features, plants and flowers, and the walkway up the very top. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore!"
,,Perfect forest feeling,5.0,,"It is grand. Great waterfall, walk in the artificial forest with variety of trees around. The crystal at 06th floor are magnificent & explains their grandeur on their own. A place must visit on Singapore tour"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"This is a temperate dome with high humidity as opposed to Singaporean heat and humidity. It’s a good attempt to bring the rainforest to the masses and is not just a way to cool down. You see some interesting plants and flowers from the higher regions of the planet. Well worth a visit as part of some time at Gardens on the Bay.

The only downside is the eco doom preaching exhibit which considering it is set in the middle of the Singapore city scape is hardly a good example of eco friendly living."
,,Nice and cool,4.0,,"When exiting you can get a stamp on your hand to re enter that day for free. Elevator takes you to the top and then you walk down through the structure with escalators.

It’s nice and cool inside after exploring Singapore in the hot humid weather. The ticket cost SG$28 for a combo ticket to see both glassed areas. It’s lobely inside and enjoyable. It’s a little pricey really. The other doom is also nice and cool.

Beautiful flowers on display with signs indicating where they are from. Educational sections about climate change and the environment."
,,Don’t miss it!,5.0,,"Just awesome! Words don’t do it justice! The orchids, begonias, fernery, are all divine, and the waterfall, spectacular,"
,,you really would be in the clouds!,5.0,,you know why they spent so much to make the gardens by the bay! it's a place not to be missed specially the rainforest dome is just awesome!
,,Truly Beautiful,5.0,,"This garden is breathtaking, the attention to detail is second to none. We spent the afternoon at the Cloud Forest with my children (18m and 4yo), we had a great time. The kids loved the water falls and all the different landscapes and plants. Highly recommend visiting!"
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a must see! Plan to spend 2 hours minimum. There is another outdoor garden along the way, separate purchase. The outdoor garden costs $8.00 and Cloud about $28. Overall these gardens are very well done and beautiful."
,,Truly magical,5.0,,"Fusion of nature and dreamlike forest setup inside an air conditioned glass conservatory.A great respite from hot and humid Singapore afternoon. A must for garden/nature/flower lovers. On entrance, there is a very high manmade waterfalll (supposedly the highest indoor waterfalll) followed by A nice walk spiraling around a manmade hill jeweled with every imaginable tropical plant and lots of flowers. Can easily spend 2-3 hours.

Is part of gardens by the Bay, the access of which is from Marina Bay Sands via overhead bridge or underground from mrt station (Bayfront)

-ve
If I have to nitpick, the access route is not fully covered which could a slight challenge during a heavy downpour or a hot sunny day. You may use their Shuttle service which is a bit pricey (SGD 3/person).
- from mrt stop or MBS, the walk to cloud forest is around 5-10 min.

Tip: try to book tickets online. This can redeemed for the the physical tickets at their ticket counter.they have a separate Online redemption counter.
Queue could be Long for the on-site ticket purchase
-"
,,Better than I expected,5.0,,"I didn’t think I’d enjoy this too much, but it was much better than expected. Great waterfall, nice and cool. Lots of things to look at other than the plants."
,,Escape the heat in this beautiful oasis!,5.0,,"I loved the Cloud Forest!! It was so nice and cool inside making it a great place to escape the Singapore heat! The whole place is so incredibly beautiful with a large variety of lush tropical plants covering the walls! It’s very well designed and also has a big range of orchids on display. It was so refreshing to stand at the bottom of the waterfall! You take a lift to the top and make your way down weaving in & out of the mountain. I would definitely recommend visiting! This was one of the highlights of our trip! We got the combination ticket but I wish we had of skipped the flower dome, personally I didn’t find it as spectacular."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The waterfall is amazing, they did such a great job creating this environment. The experience takes about 1 to 2 hours."
,,Probably our number one,5.0,,"We spent 3 days in Singapore and this was our most enjoyable venue.
We assumed that the dome would be similar to the Eden Project domes in Cornwall in the UK. It is not - it is far better.
You enter and the first thing you see ahead of you is a 'mountain' with an enormous waterfall. It then gets better and better.
There is an important underlying message as you do the tour - sustainability.
Very highly recommended"
,,Experience Mountain and the waterfall,4.0,,"Great experience, one has to go up by elevator and then come down the winding pathway. The experience is akin to the rain forest or Africa in its plants and flowers plus the mist of the roaring waterfall. You might want a wind cheater or light umbrella or rain coat for a short time, if you prefer not to get wet"
,,Beautiful and Fragnant Garden. Must visit,5.0,,"People who love flowers and garden. Must visit this place. Being inside here, is like having a aroma therapy. Such a beautfully maintained garden. Can see different types of flowers and vertical garden with indoor water fall together. Just superb."
,,Its like being in the jungle,5.0,,"What actually is amazing is the actual engineering to build this place and then have all the plants in the structure with the waterfall. The way they make you walk your way around then up the waterfall in the elevator then you make your way down in and out of the waterfall is incredible. You think you have finished seeing it but it keeps going, very well done. The flora is great the way it binds to the waterfall. You can get selfies from the bottom and top of the waterfall and other great picks. Take your time as there are many angles to take photos from, but its hard to take in the entire structure only really with your eye as its so high. Check out the carnivorous plants towards the end, very interesting, but watch you don't get eaten;)"
,,Absolute wow!,5.0,,"This is a no brainer. When you are in Singapore you gotta visit this Dome. It starts with a beautiful waterfall and a big wall filles with flowers. Going through the Dome the path takes you upwards where you can see an astonishing wall filled with all kinds of flowers.

No efforst were spared in this place. Definately value for money.
Easy accesible for kids and elderly people as well as disabled. L

We took the combination with the Flower Dome. Admission per adult 28SGD. Kids under three are admission free."
,,Cloud Forrest at the Bay,5.0,,This is a must see for any visitor to Singapore. I have no real interest in floral displays but this takes anything I have seen previously to a whole new level
,,Go Early,5.0,,"On entry you are met by the impressive waterfall, and the welcome respite from the heat outside, there is an obvious path to follow, at the end of which you can take a lift to the upper walkway.
Tip, get there early as lengthy queues form later."
,,Beautiful indoor Gardens,4.0,,"Gardens by the Bay is an unique structure with 2 large domes covering different styles of gardens. Cloud Forest starts with a steep indoor waterfall and takes you through a range of plants and trees that dot the landscape of various tropical forests. The walk down the ramps gives you something different at each level, so a definite place to visit"
,,My 2nd Visit,5.0,,I fell in love with this place. Visited twice within 2 years. The Falls resembles tranquility. The Cloud Walk is awesome. Tree Top Walk also a must do unless you are afraid of height.
,,Didn't want to leave,5.0,,"A micro world of flora that is hard to forget - cool, refreshing, crystaline - this is a one of a kind exhibit that you must do!!!!"
,,The falls is cool,4.0,,"But after taking photos and getting misted, there is nothing more to do except to go out. Place is not really meant for anything much but to be misted by the artificial (awesome if i might say) falls. I brought raincoats for the kids for fear of rains and it proved useful at the falls. I suggest if your kids wanna explore that bit, bring a raincoat for them."
,,So realistic,5.0,,Everything is so well laid out that it makes it almost real. The artificial misty mountain of greenery makes it outstanding. The noise of the falling water together with the full scenery makes you feel as if you were in a real forest with a waterfall. A must see.
,,Dancing with Clouds,5.0,,"Have a cool shower of blessing at the main entrance as cool mist swirls around you, transporting you to another world. The carefully curated plants will have you believe you’re climbing a mountain, and you won’t even break a sweat! Dance with the cloud as you take in the picturesque environment!"
,,Do not miss out on going!,5.0,,I have been to the Cloud Forest too many times to number. I am a member of Gardens by the Bay so can basically go as many times as I want as part of my subscription. I would have to say wandering through the Cloud Forest is always refreshing and I am continually amazed at how it was built but more importantly how they can grow so many plants that survive together in harmony. I always take my visitors here and it is always interesting to see the different parts of the Cloud Forest that they enjoy the most. Sometimes it might be 6 months before we go through the Cloud Forest and usually there are things that have changed or been added so again a pure delight to see!
,,Breath taking - so remarkable with so much to take in.,5.0,,Great part of the Gardens by the Bay - something wonderful to look at each step into these amazing gardens. very thankful for digital cameras - took hundreds of photos. Definitely a must see in Singapore
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,Part of the Gardens by the Bay. Highly recommended. The walk through these gardens are nothing but spectacular. We in aor of the whole experience. Will not be disappointed. Love it all.
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore. Reasonably priced and part of a much larger garden area. Well worth the visit.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The mist, the vertical display and the huge variety of plants is magnificent. All of this captures the beautiful outlook overlooking the Marina bay."
,,A O KAY,5.0,,"This park is one of the best in the country, and perhaps in the world. The workers maintain is daily with excellence. To be enjoyed alone, with your family, or for a romantic walk with a loved one."
,,Cloud forest Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,A must go place in Singapore to get close to nature. Breath-taking man made waterfall and wide range of plants and flowers from all over the world. Spend the afternoon here to escape the harsh heat of Singapore.
,,"Very nice enclosure, respite from the heat. BUT at a price.",4.0,,"Okay, I wondered what the fuss was about Gardens by the Bay since this was not the first thing that comes to mind when visiting Singapore. Eventually made it to the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome my 4th visit to Singapore. For people coming from places who do have the luxury to enjoy beautiful gardens and greenhouses, I am not really sure what the fuss is about having a large enclosure like this. But to get a balanced view, for those who never would care to explore to far off places and experience the flora at different altitudes, this just might be a good invitation. The sad thing I think is - I know that this is all man-made. It takes a lot of energy to maintain and run a place like this. Pity to note that such nice places like this comes up with an expensive ticket price before you can enjoy it."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,I have been into the cloud forest 4 times and it gets better every time as the plants mature. Wonderfully relaxing to stroll around.
,,A must visit place for tourists,4.0,,Amazing indoor structure of many plants and waterfall. Can be a bit cold inside due to the airconditioning.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"Imagine walking into the top of a dome & seeing an amazing waterfall, incredible gardens & yes, even clouds. This is technology at its best and a definite must see."
,,A truly unique experience,5.0,,Such an amazing short escape to nirvana - amazing flora & fauna - throw in a waterfall and the thrill of getting a panoramic view walking on the sky paths - must see on a things to do list in Singapore - almost worth coming to Singapore just for this
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,Best way to spend the evening with family. watching sunset with a nice breeze behind you was a great feeling.
,,We spent a late afternoon & into the evening @ this wonderfull exhibition,5.0,,"Visitng these Gardens by the Bay was one of our highlights to our holiday ,we spent many hours there & was sorry to leave ."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This was located within the Gardens by the Bat complex. We had walked around the gardens when we decided to visit here. It had been so hot and humid outside that when we walked into here it was a godsend! It was cool and the felt fresh to breath. After half an hour in here we felt refreshed. The fountain was good and it was worth a visit to see the numerous plants growing inside.
,,Awesome,5.0,,A great place to visit. Iconic and thoughtfully presented. Easy to just drop in and meander around. Very pleasant evening spent here when everything was lit up.
,,Hidden Nature :),5.0,,Simply outstanding and beautiful. It gets really cold inside because of the water fall (even if its crazy hot outside). Do remember to take something warm. Amazing park/forest. Very well kept.
,,Cloud top walk,5.0,,Beautiful plants in the huge glass house. Take the lift to 7th floor and walk around admiring the views and your surroundings. On way down plenty more to see. Good value can spend a ling time here
,,A Remarkable Garden,5.0,,What a remarkable human-made environment. This is a recreated tropical mountain climate and environment and includes a waterfall and a descending path from a simulated 3000 metres to 1000 metres. First you catch an elevator and ascend to 42 metres above the ground and then descend along a winding path and bridges through the changing vegetation zones - it is fascinating.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I am a lover of waterfalls and this attraction didn't disappoint. Everything about it is just so well laid out and designed to give the best experience.
,,Day time better,5.0,,Was lucky to visit the Cloud Forest during the day and night. Day time is much better and easier to see the detail in all the foliage also less crowded. Make sure you allow enough time to get up to the top level.
,,Nature in a dome,5.0,,"In a simpler terms this is a beautiful cold greenhouse filled with some of the most beautiful plants. You can buy the entry pass here itself, work pass holder will get discount so don't forget to flash your card. Do buy the buggy ride (S$3) coz it's unlimited and totally worth it after a long day.

Best time to be here is around 6:30PM as the climb up might take 45 mins. So it'll be nice to catch the sunset and night scene.

PSA: And please don't cut queue people, we are civilised human being. Stop being selfish and let's just enjoy the nature."
,,Fab waterfall,5.0,,"I would highly recommend visiting here whilst in Singapore. The waterfall is great to seem, and you also get to go to the top. It’s very cool in here, so is a lovely place to go to have some time away from the Singapore heat."
,,Unique Highlight,5.0,,"Highlight of the gardens. This large domed enclosure is especially unique with an artificial misty mountain of greenery. This is a great space to escape the heat for an hour or so. Lots to see, truly magnificent."
,,Thumbs up!,5.0,,"Enter into the waterfalls. Lots of elephant ears, colourful leaves, all shades of green, beautiful orchid flowers, exotic carnivorous plants... very educational. Great gardening talents and design."
,,A cool and comfortable visit,5.0,,Cloud Forest has many peculiar species of plants that you will not find as beautifully arranged anywhere else. It must surely be said that it is one of the best!
,,We were not expecting this beautiful forest where ever you look there was something new. We walk ariund for hours.,5.0,,"this is another wonder of Singapore, this is one thing one has to see, not only because is beautiful its magical, I have travel a lot , but this is something. Go and see it!!!"
,,This is so beautiful,4.0,,"This one of the places that I did not know about but it really impressed. As it was like an indoor forest, with a water fall. And flowers growing freely like simularly to a real forest"
,,The Falls,5.0,,This was certainly a highlight in the cloud forest. There were a lot of tourists taking pictures there.
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"This place is magical, please take all the time you need to see it and catch the message it wants to leave us."
,,Amazing design,5.0,,"When you step into the cloud forest entrance, you can feel the water freshness and the green environment in this section. The waterfall looks gorgeous and there is a sky track at the top of the ""mountain"". You can walk around the track to enjoy the view, it is a nice experience. P/S maybe it is a challenge to someone who afraid of high."
,,Beautiful place to spend a few hours exploring,5.0,,The cloud forest is just an amazing construction with its massive waterfall and so many different plants and flowers. The orchid display is fantastic. Very easy to spend a lot of time just wandering and discovering.
,,Beautiful Design!!,5.0,,"The indoor waterfall is amazing. If you are afraid of heights then do not walk along the bridges. The only downside was the amount of people trying to get the perfect Instagram photo, thus not allowing you to take photos of the beauty with the facility unless you do not mind their photo shoots in your photo."
,,It is unique and refreshing,5.0,,The entire dome has an artificial waterfall and amazing plants and flowers on each floor. There is a pathway to walk down witnessing the amazing architecture. It is new and unique. You will love it. It is airconditioned.
,,AMAZING!!!,5.0,,"Excellent day trip. Lot to see , and enjoy every part of it. Staff very friendly and qing system is efficient."
,,Visit to Cloud Forest,5.0,,The place has different variety of pretty flowers. It is clean and has in built air condition for 10/10 flower admiration experience.
,,Amazing.,5.0,,"Allow yourself the time to enjoy this at a slow pace as there is lots to see, so very well thought out."
,,Impressive experience,5.0,,The waterfall is amazing. Although a little bit cold and wet this was a great experience. and to our amazement not really very busy. You can enjoy everything in a relaxed pace.
,,Good outing location!!,5.0,,Cheap price to pay for the views we saw. Had a great time with my friends. Recommended as an outing location :)
,,"Waterfall is impressive, attraction is educational but tourists must pay more to see this exhibit",4.0,,"Tourists have no choice but to buy tickets for this and the nearby flower dome attraction. Locals can opt for either, but we tourists have no choice but to pay ""extra"" to see cloud forest (because, frankly, I would not have paid much or anything to see flower dome). That said, putting aside ""tie-in"" purchase policy designed to get more money from tourists, Cloud Forest is an engineering marvel in its replication of various bio-climates that support a plethora of topical plants. The Skywalk provides a circular pathway though multiple climate levels and offers fantastic, closeup views and photo opportunities. It might, depending on your level of geekness, might be worth the $26 of admission by itself."
,,Pre-Book,5.0,,One of the main attraction of the Gardens in the Bay pre- book to go straight into the doom for the attraction loads to see. Get a stamp to revisit again later.
,,nothint to die for,2.0,,is just a closed area with 'waterfall' which is very artificial and not worth the payment. Cold inside so get something to cover yourself.
,,Impressive!,4.0,,"You see a huge waterfall as you enter the cloud forest and then take a lift to the top and walk down a series of suspended walkways. These are not good for anyone with vertigo. They are high and open, allowing a great view of the plants. The orchids are especially impressive"
,,Foreat in the City,3.0,,"The main attraction here is waterfall. Besides that, they have cloud walk and tropical walk. You can enjoy the walk and watching the scenery and fauna there. For those who afraid height, they have escalator so you no need to walk at cloud walk."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,This is an experience not to be missed. Beautifully laid out and a most enjoyable time was had by all. Highly recommended.
,,A Must See,4.0,,This was our second time through. The first in dayloigh and the second at night. Both very enjoyable and would recommend to anyone to see
,,Excellent,5.0,,The small dome was unimpressive as all decked out with Disney between the plants for Christmas but the large dome was amazing. Well worth a visit
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,"We reached late in the evening and we had to choose between Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. We chose Cloud Forest, and were not disappointed. The forest is very well planned, but the main attraction is the large indoor waterfall. Cloud Forest is worth a visit."
,,Truly breathtaking,5.0,,The sheer size and range of plants on offer is amazing. Such a great concept and a great cool place to hang during the middle of the day.
,,Fantastic and informative,5.0,,Gives you a great insight on some amazing plant life and has an area of interesting stalagmites and stalactites.well worth a visit.
,,Wonderful time at the Cloud forest,5.0,,"If you are going to the gardens by the bay you must seem the cloud forest, you have to pay $26 each to visit this and the flower garden but it is worth it just remember to check what time the fogging times are for the best pictures."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,The cloud forest was absolutely gorgeous and really informative too! It was fairly priced and you can spend a good amount of time looking around and reading about the environment and how the forests are made. I thought it was a great edition to our itinerary in Singapore!
,,Greatly And Smartly managed,5.0,,"Me and my wife enjoyed a lot, wow experience once again, world's quality and superior sight seeing within cloud forest"
,,A Stand Out Attraction you’ve got to see!,5.0,,"Space age dome filled with the most amazing vertical gardens and the tallest indoor waterfalls. Topped off by the skywalks that allow you to look down at the gardens at height. We did it at dusk, so it looked magical as the skywalk platforms lit up...and it was a refreshing way to end a hot day getting the spray from the waterfalls on our faces. A must see!"
,,An internal waterfall was just the beginning,5.0,,"We were told that we should visit the Cloud Forest, and what a find! It was absolutely amazing what the curators have achieved and what was growing inside this controlled space. From the welcoming internal waterfall we meandered up into the clouds! The plants changing, the interest increasing.

A must see if you have half a day in Singapore."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Grreat place to spend a few hours, plenty to see and getting up high to look down was well worth it. Exhibits are immaculate and plenty to photograph too."
,,"Amazing, but crowded",5.0,,"A wonderful attraction, but was quite crowded while were were there. Storms had driven everyone inside which didn't help. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Remarkable indoor climate controlled dome,5.0,,Right from the outset you are struck by the amazing indoor waterfall and treated to a rich array of tropical species from around the globe. Plants are carefully groomed and maintained to recreate a cloud forest. The inspiration is drawing together sculpture art and conservation in this space. The views from the top balcony are magnificent and provide incredible juxtaposition between the plant and built world.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,It`s worth every cent that you pay as it soon becomes a memory for your whole life. You can take the elevator to go up the mountains or ``climb`` both ways.
,,Must see,5.0,,An engineering Marvel and a must see if you are in Singapore as you can combine the visit with the Super trees and the gardens by the Bay. Not just for folks with an interest in flowers!
,,A magnificent capsule of nature,5.0,,The cloud forest is the most beautiful natural yet air conditioned enclosure I have ever visited. The multilevel garden is a mini forest packed into this magnificent capsule of nature!
,,Just incredible,5.0,,"I thought that the Forest Dome was amazing but this was certainly topped by the Cloud Dome. What a piece of design and imagination. These exhibits are not just wonderful to see, they are educational as well. Another must see attraction in Singapore."
,,Worth a trip,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our trip here, it's lovely and cool inside. It takes quite a while to wander around the whole dome and it's full of interesting sculptures and beautiful flowers."
,,Worth the ticket,5.0,,I loved this place. Took the kids and spend some time wondering around and enjoying the plants and the nice cool atmosphere. Always busy but well worth the visit. Especially recommended on a hot Singapore day!
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"We had a great experience in this man-made forest! It was truly impressive to watch the various parts of the forest and how the climate changed from bottom to the top.

Big plus for the videos about climate change and what we can do to contribute on this alarming topic.

Watch more photos we shot from here on @ArtfulVisuals on instagram"
,,Do it at night...,5.0,,This green house garden is huge and towers over 6 stories high. Walk on up then take the outer path down . It will test your stamina with heights but very safe . DO IT AT NIGHT as the whole dome and gardens are light up and the water fall is even more impressive.
,,Very Beautiful and cool inside!,5.0,,"No matter how hot it is outside in Singapore, inside the Cloud Forest is the opposite, simply cool and beautiful.

As you've walk inside and greeted which coolness you will see the indoor waterfall which is simply beautiful, it can get crowded as it the first thing everyone see and will stop for photo opportunity.

Once you move on from the waterfall you will start to experience all the plants and flowers along the way. You will soon make your way up to the top via the elevator and walk you way down on to the cloud bridge. You'll get the experience the plants as it very dried on top like the real mountain and when you make your way down it start to become more natural. Once your in the bottom floor you will be in a theater room and they will show a clip on repeat about how the world is slowly getting destroy etc (can be kind of depressing but true).

Anyway overall it simply beautiful! Highly recommend it!"
,,Artificial environment for tropical forest,4.0,,"You can see millions of forest plant species inside here. You will definitely love this place if you loves flora and plants. If you have kids, this is a good place to bring them and teach them about plants.

This place could easily takes you 1hour to finish the whole trip at peak hour.

I loves the waterfall at the entrance. Don't miss out the photo at the fall."
,,Beautiful indoor experience,5.0,,This indoor garden walk with waterfalls was amazing. They were highlighting orchids when we were there and we got to see many that were large and some that were small through a magnifying lens. It was cool in the building which is a plus being so hot and humid outside. Elevated walkways took us around 360 degrees in the planted center with views inside the building and outside.
,,Feels good to be in,4.0,,It is an essentially an indoor conservatory. There are large waterfalls and beautiful plants you can take pictures with. There are a lot of pipes letting out vapours that appear like clouds. Must see if you are in Singapore.
,,"Beautiful, peaceful and wonderful to visit",5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is truly amazing with the most amazing plants of all types, size and colour. The orchids are spectacular. A must see in Singapore."
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,"This is one of the two domes in gardens by the bay. There is a tall man made waterfall inside with lots of different plants around it. It is a nice thing to see, but I do prefer the flower dome over this one."
,,Well done to appreciate the mountain climatic zones,5.0,,Must visit while you are in the Gardens by the bay. Water fall and the rain forest creations are superb. Lot of walking but worth it.
,,World class attraction,5.0,,On paper it sounds like a greenhouse with a some trees in it.... the reality is an inspiring places that makes you appreciate our environment and totally blows your mind... stunning idea and stunning place
,,Amazing one,5.0,,This one has all potential plants in the world . Two eyes are not sufficient to finish this attraction
,,Spectacular with a side of fear of heights!,3.0,,"The cloud forest was spectacular and beautiful, however if you have a fear of heights be careful when you reach the top. I felt there was no signage to warn people of this and it was the only way to get out by following the flow of people.

Signage was poor on indicating the exits - actually signs everywhere for exits but they were emergency only. More signs to show the way out need to be made more clear."
,,Love this place,5.0,,I always look forward to visiting Gardens by the bay when in Singapore.This is a wonderful place and I recommend that you do not miss this amazing architectural and botanical wonderland.
,,Must see,5.0,,"This visit was unplanned, and I was surprised at what an amazing attraction it was. As it is indoors, it's good to do on a hot day, you walk along platforms in a rainforest with a giant waterfall, just amazing."
,,Great waterfall,4.0,,"Great for all ages and a great chance to get up close with beautiful plants in a surprising cool setting.

Enjoy the journey from top to bottom with a great array of plants on walkways.

Some very hard hitting messages at the end of Cloud about the environment

The other venue about other plants is a much quicker visit for most tourists but worth 30-45 minutes nevertheless

The shop also has a few impressive items amongst the tourist tatt."
,,Well worth the money!,5.0,,Such an impressive man made attraction! Well worth the adventure. Good to explore the whole area. Sprinklers go off a few hours which is pretty cool!
,,Interesting experience,5.0,,We went here as a duo package with the flower dome. it was another great place to escape the heat as it was air conditioned. You enter at a lower level and climb around and through an indoor waterfall. It's very photogenic everywhere and the diversity of plants is wonderful to see.
,,Pretty impressive!,5.0,,"This under the dome activity is pretty impressive from a logistical point of view, and well worth a visit."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Brilliant gardens and waterfalls and features that you will not forget I a hurry. From a mist of water spray as you enter to the intricate plants, ferns and delicate orchards interacting and forming this beautiful living and growing display to the conservation video at the
End. A real treat."
,,huge spread of fauna,5.0,,"O.M.G!!!! awesome eye for details.... so many variety of plants at one place. a must visit place, but with a little leisure."
,,👍👍👍👍,4.0,,"Gorgeous view of the greeneries + waterfall. Very cooling upon entering the place. Pretty big space but wish there are more places to walk around to. It's like you turn one round and you're done with the ""journey"". The bridge was cool too!"
,,"""wonderful""",5.0,,"What ever you do in Singapore pay the money and experience this wonderful garden that's loveingly attended to, amazing!"
,,MUST- the best of Singapore,5.0,,"best attraction, no matter if you like or not flowers and plants. impressive in every detail. UNESCO list chose this one for the reason. 6 level of beautiful nature, sculptures and flowers with an internal waterfall."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Delightful visual experience recommended to all, beautifully laid out and the camera kept clicking throughout. Plants, water, views congratulations to the designer for a near masterpiece."
,,Terrible,1.0,,Concrete and some artificial looking plants. With very obviously artificial stupid taps open and called it waterfall. Not to mention the country is full of rude racist people. Can’t wait to get out of this crap concrete jungle.
,,Upset the wife.,5.0,,"This is a magical place, we rode up in the lift and walked down through all the areas. There are amazing sculpture's scattered everywhere. The only problems was the entrance is quite misty and the wife complained that it was going to mess her hair up."
,,Bring a jacket,5.0,,The place was beautiful although there were a lot of people. We booked our ticket at klook so we just breezed in. There were lines in elevators. The place is stroller friendly. My parents and my daughter really enjoyed the place. Good thing I let my baby wore her jacket. It was very cold and wet.
,,Garden by the Bay: Cloud Forest,5.0,,"This is one of the best garden in the world. Singapore has been named as the garden city and this is one of place of interest where tourist should visit. This is an awesome place where you do not want to miss while you are in Singapore. Its cooling (air conditional) inside with the waterfall and you can see some of the plants that do not origin from Singapore. The flowers and plants that grow in there give you a totally different experiences as compared to the tropical feelings that you encounter outside. It is like a forest found within a metropolitan city. Beside the Cloud Forest, there are many interesting gardens that you can visit and nice city skylight to view."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,This place is SSSOOO amazing. Just loved being there. Didn't want to leave. Well done! The planning of such an indoor version of the outdoors is mind boggling.
,,"For an artificial garden, this is quite incredible",5.0,,"This was my favourite part of Gardens by the Bay. I think the key to really enjoying this is not to expect it to be like a natural garden, but to just appreciate it for what it is. No, it is not a natural waterfall, but it is incredible. The plantings are beautiful; fabulous display of a wide range of orchids, ferns and many other plants. The climate change videos inside were well done, thought provoking, and horrifying. We visited both domes and this was much more interesting to me."
,,Air-conditioned garden beauty,5.0,,Great to cool off after walking around the outdoor gardens. The Sustainability video at the end is thought-provoking and emotional.
,,"Immersive, Creative Experience",5.0,,"A unique arboretum on a massive scale, this is distinctly different from any other and worthy of a visit."
,,Glasshouse with a Difference,5.0,,"When you step into the dome the waterfall is in front of you, falling some 35m. You can then meander upwards and enjoy the lush vegetation on the man-made mountain. The dome replicates a cool moist tropical region and features orchids, ferns and many more plants from South East Asia, Africa and America. Enjoy the Lost World, Crystal Mountain, Cloud and Treetop Walks, Cavern and the Secret Garden; see the view from behind the Waterfall. It may be man-made but there are many wonders within."
,,Immerse yourself in another world,5.0,,"A creative show of the biodiversity of the rain forest, allowing you to climb up in the canopies and see the different plants that grow there, then as you walk down then circular walkway discover how the forest comes alive. Amazing plants, water features, sounds and sites - excellent for all ages"
,,Third visit to Gardens by the Bay in August,5.0,,On my third visit with my ex-colleague we walked through Cloud Forest. The view is absolutely breath taking from the bridge that goes around the landscaping. The waterfall is simply amazing.
,,Beautiful glass dome,5.0,,Loved the Waterfall and to go up behind it and walk amongst the plants and flowers was fabulous.the orchid display was stunning.
,,Awesome,5.0,,One of the beautiful place to visit in Singapore. How they have been created from scratch on the marina bay is really good to know.
,,excellent,5.0,,"The experience is unforgettable. The planning is superb. getting the plants from all over the world and maintaining a wonderful environment is commendable. The indoor falls, The walk around the plant towers, The view points is enjoyable. The misty environment and the information of the plants were superb. Not to miss it."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Make sure you do this when in Singapore. Get a joint ticket for this and the Flower Dome and lose yourself for 2 or 3 hours. My favourite was the Cloud Forest, but both are great."
,,Good attraction,4.0,,"We bought tickets for the cloud and flower dome as it appears only locals can get single tickets for either attraction.

The cloud dome centre piece is a large waterfall which is impressive. There are walkways around the dome and you do get to the top of the dome where you also get good views outside the dome. Lifts are available. Other than the waterfall there are an array of plants that you would possibly find at the top of the tree canopy.

Alongside this there is the eco message we should all be listening to if we want this planet to endure."
,,amazing,5.0,,this is a must see when you fo to garden by the bay. a really beautiful forest housed in a stunning glass dome.
,,Visit at dusk,5.0,,The cloud zone is an amazing structure with a massive waterfall and plenty of greenery. You make your way up to view the different levels in a mist. This is best experienced late afternoon so you can make the most of the gardens of the bay at night.
,,Beauty at Its Best,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is amazing. It makes you want to protect the environment. It’s tranquil, cool, and stocked with fantastic flora. The sky walk is fun and provides great views of the space and outside surroundings. Go in the morning before it gets too crowded."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"This was an interesting area, walking down from the top. Easy walk and some lovely flowers and plants within."
,,amazing waterfalls,5.0,,"the indoor waterfalls is breath taking. you need to take an elevator until the highest floor and from there, you can start you stroll. spectacular view of marina bays sands and every thing surrounds it. the stroll around the ""cloud forest"" is undeniably one of its kind! you can take scenic view of the waterfalls below or ontop. highly recommend to visit!"
,,Disappointing for Australians,3.0,,The waterfall is well built - but it's no better than the beautiful waterfalls that we have back home - in particular in the Blue Mountains. The crowds were crazy. I found the exit after only 5 minutes.
,,Fantastic thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,"Definitely a must see activity for anyone visiting Singapore. You could either purchase tickets with the gardens or just see this (which is dependent on how much time you have). This was a fantastic educational activity as the exhibit also included information for the floral diversity that resided on each elevational level. Additionally, the end included a ecological message and ways for people to ‘go green’. I highly recommend going there!"
,,Absolutely amazing!,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit with kids. The design is equivalent to a real cloud forest. Good to visit for experiencing this amazing view, waterfalls and walk around"
,,What an experience,5.0,,The cloud forest mesmerizes you with the huge waterfall and the lush green plantations. The pitcher plants at the top we're my favorite. Overall highly recommended if you go to gardens by the bay
,,Amazing,5.0,,Indoors but you wouldn't really know it this is a fantastic experience though it attracts many visitors so never what you might call tranquil.
,,Real Rainbow Under Artificial Waterfall,4.0,,"We were surprised to see a rainbow under the waterfall. The waterfall itself was beautiful, the rainbow made it even more amazing.

Took me half an hour to walk through the whole thing. Saw a short clip on climate change near the exit. I wish they had more text to explain what we are seeing.

A good place to visit if you have nothing to do and want to spend a relaxing afternoon. It's comfortably cool inside."
,,Must do,5.0,,We visited the Cloud Forest and it was fantastic. Beautifully laid out with so many different types of plants. Well done and thanks
,,HEAVEN,5.0,,"This is again a brilliant climatically controlled experience of Aqua,flora in rain forest environment"
,,WOW!!,5.0,,Another must see in Singapore. Incredible greenery & a stunning waterfall are just a part of this beautiful garden. Highly recommend a visit.
,,Very nice stop in Singapore,5.0,,You can spend 2 hours taking pictures and seeing all of the different shrubbery which is beautiful. Take the time to visit and you will not be disappointed
,,Like in a Spaceship - but a green one!,5.0,,Cloud Forest totally exceeded all our expectations! We actually only bought the combo ticket by accident - and then we were delighted by the design! The view is fantastic and the atmosphere is amazing!
,,Welcomed Surprise,4.0,,"This was a welcomed surprise in the Gardens. It’s worth paying to go into the 2 indoor gardens but if you only want to wonder around outside, you can do for free. The sky walkway is a separate ticket to the domes but is a good way to see the whole gardens. But be wary that if it’s raining the walkways outside will be closed."
,,Don't expect too much but it's good,3.0,,We went to both the Dom's the cloud forest and the flower Dom. I like the flower dom. It was the sunflower theme. We missed the orchid theme in august.we wanted to see the orchids since me and my wife likes orchid.the sunflower also was good. The cloud forest was not that exiting for us since come from India we see them a lot and few of them are grown in our own gardens. But the theme was good and it was cold and cozy. And the water sprinkling all over was nice. We actually went in the morning we sent our sic cab back and told we will return by ourselves. So we went to the children's park were there are both fountain shower for kids and play park for kids. Our 2 year kid enjoyed there. We waited for evening to see the light show .it is good not extraordinary.we headed back to hotel through the MRT. I prefer to go to this place in the evening see the Dom's and the light show and avoid weakened.
,,Relaxing scenery,5.0,,This is a pleasant cool change from the busy Singapore tourist spots. I was surprised about the size and the wide range of displays. Well worth a visit.
,,Surprisingly beautiful,5.0,,"I was really surprised by Cloud Forest. I don't know what I was expecting but this surprised, excited and delighted me. It was my favourite. The kids also loved it but I think they were excited by my enthusiasm. Beautiful experience. Just make sure to bring a cardi as I got cold."
,,So awesome,5.0,,One of the highlights of our visit. I highly suggest getting here as they open to avoid the crowds and make the experience more enjoyable. Plan on spending a hour minimum...more if you want the audio tour.

,,Great But Cold,4.0,,"I find it was a great experience they had floors of different layers and it was a great experience but it was very cold, colder than my liking. I still think it was not a waste if money and I would definitely go again! I do recommend to bring a jumper or something warm."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I highly recommend this place, the view on entering is astounding, like something from the movie Avatar. Be prepared for a que though."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"The cloud forest is a awesome place visit on a hot day (every day is hot) it can get a bit crowded but a lot of tourist attractions are like that in Singapore, the man made 35metre waterfall keeps the place cool with the myriad of plants to view this place can keep you enthralled for hpurs"
,,Cloud Forest wow,5.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest luckily on a sunny day, as you wander through the mist, see spectacular waterfall, walls of gardens and so many beautiful plants and flowers. Well worth a vist especially on a hot day as it is also a great way to cool off."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,What a wonderful place to visit really lovely. Singapore is a hot and steamy place so it was lovely to walk into the cloud forest and see the waterfall. The air is so fresh and clean take a big breath as you go inside so refreshing.
,,Stunning,4.0,,"Just so clever how this has been arranged, the only thing that I didn't like was the display of stalagmites that have been taken from caves around the world. What happened to the 'take only photos leave only footprints' motto?"
,,Brilliant concept!,4.0,,This place is air conditioned like the flower dome. There is an artificial waterfall and artificial mist at fixed timings that are not to be missed. Although the mist did not cover the whole place to give a real feeling of mist it was still a brilliant idea.
,,"visit to nature, it's like the original....",4.0,,"The last trip to this vanue, it's looks quite steal... But, last month visit i'm very imprase...It's looking and feel that you are near the wall fall..."
,,Magical place,5.0,,"The cloud forest is amazing. It is such a magical place. Everything is done so well and there is so much to look at. The walk up in the clouds is really good. Even though I am scared of heights, I still make sure I do it when visitingl."
,,Perfect to escape the hot weather and still be 'outdoor',5.0,,"Great place to escape the city life and be immerse in nature. It's a place that allow young and old, physical ability of all level to enjoy a day out."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The cloud forest exceeded my expectations. There is a wide variety of flora and the presentation was beautiful. I enjoyed the views which were stunning. I also thought the sculptures using wood and other products provided a bit of whimsy which would appeal to children.
,,very nice,5.0,,very nice even tho we had to queue quite awhile to get up to the top of the cloud forest to get to see all around it
,,Amazing garden inside a huge dome,4.0,,"We thought this was a great way to spend a wet day outside - a lovely lush tropical garden with massive internal waterfall - impressive. The air had a truly damp cool jungle feeling as we walked in. The Skywalk was interesting to capture the experience from up high. And great views out to the city from there.
We bought our tickets on Klook to save money, the queues and the trees (electronic ticket sent to your phone) - well worth it."
,,Interesting place and worth a visit,5.0,,"When going to the Gardens by the Bay, don't skip this place. It's hot inside but it's worth it. Some great flora to see and it's well maintained."
,,As great as everyone tells it is,5.0,,"Absolutely magnificent experience. Not visiting the Cloud Forest, when being to Singapore is a crime in and of itself. I would however advise to visit the Flower Dome first. It is beautiful in a more subtle way, and if you go in an opposite order, your experience of the Cloud Forest may overshadow that of the Flower Dome. However, if you can only afford visiting one - go for the forest."
,,Some tropics under a dome.,4.0,,"The cloud forest are quiet interesting to visit. It seems not that big when you enter but still takes about an half an hour to walk the the dome. Please come when they have the ""vapour"" moments."
,,Tall waterfall,5.0,,This amazing structure houses a giant waterfall surrounded by exotic Flora of many kinds. Even some insectivorous plants. The walk up the water fall is great and a must do.
,,Great rainy day activity,5.0,,It’s so serene and the flowers are amazing. I saw some of the most amazing orchids and the gardens are pristine here. Definitely a must see spot if you visit Singapore.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Skip the flower dome and visit the cloud forest instead, try to time your visit just before the misting starts as this adds a surreal edge to the walk through"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I liked this dome better than the Flower dome,lots of plants similar to home and its a credit to the people who look after and maintain this dome, Awesome"
,,Incredible place ... good to escape the Singapore heat!,5.0,,"I was amazed by the cloud forest. It is huge and yet you can easily walk around it. I recommend going here quite early or later in the day as the crowds can get quite significant. However, even if it is crowded it's definitely worth a visit"
,,Inspired by “Avatar”,5.0,,waw!!! An unbelievable place to visit. Water fall in the front gives you goose bumps. It’s another world created in a dome.
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"I am in the minority I know, but I was so disappointed with the cloud dome. It was hard to appreciate the scenery with the enormous number of people crammed in. I expected to be blown away but it was all a bit meh. But then again I come from Tasmania where we have the real thing."
,,Beautiful indoor installation,5.0,,"This is a beautiful indoor installation that truly feels like you are outdoor. The waterfalls and endless flowers will keep you staring. Note that although this is in the same complex as gardens by the bay, you have to pay separately to get in. Think it’s worth it!"
,,Absolutely stunning - but arrive early to avoid the crowds,5.0,,One of my favourite places in the world. It can get quite busy especially around misting times. If you're after good tourist-free shots I would recommend arriving first thing in the morning
,,Coordinate with gardens by the bay,5.0,,"This is an amazing indoor transformation. I casual walk through the dome to see the cloud forest and water falls, along with the many many plant species ."
,,Amazing & Surreal Experience,5.0,,Totally awed by the misty greenery and waterfall. I took my time and do not want to get caught with the other tourists who are quite eager to get ahead of the queue to make the ascend to the top of the trail and descending on the trail. Slowed down and savoured the ambience.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Bought our tickets at the ticketing office near the entrance of Gardens by the Bay, and then we got the shuttle to Cloud Forest. Get here early if you want better photos! Can get pretty busy and noisy with groups of tourists.

Found the structure of the walkways and dome incredible, and all the plants and the way everything is designed is beautiful. Amazing waterfall too! A good place to spend 1-2 hours admiring the nature. Also some good views looking out of the dome to the Supertree Grove and Marina Bay."
,,Glad we got to check this place out,4.0,,"family friendly

If you plan on checking out garden by the bay light show, cloud forest is a nice place to visit and kill time while it’s hot out. Tickets can be purchased by the booth on the day of visit. The cloud forest and flower dome only requires 1 ticket per admission because they come together. The flower dome was nice but I was more entertained in the cloud forest."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,A wonderful experience and so many plants to see and photo. great for all ages and for wheelchair and pushchair access.
,,Very Nice place to spend 2-3 hrs,4.0,,You feel that you are very close to nature and green beauty. You can spend upto 2-3 hrs on this place and don't forget to take lots of pics :)
,,In the Clouds,4.0,,"A must-see for rain forest enthusiasts who are looking for a place to relax in the middle of the urban jungle. With temperature-controlled environs, it's a great place to discover the fauna of Singapore and beyond."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,I didn't know what to expect walking into the cloud forest. Exceeded my expectations and enjoyed my walk around here. There was a hard hitting exhibition about environmental issues facing this planet and showed an important message. Singapore is a very fast forward nation and I loved it.
,,Four-storey high waterfall from artificial mountain inside greenhouse,5.0,,"This is the companion to the greenhouse next door. The walkways through and around the ""mountain"" allow close-up viewing of the plants. We were lucky enough to also see some of the workers replacing the plants (I had wondered how it was done)."
,,Another world,5.0,,"I was amaze by this wonderful park. You can even think you were in the Avartar world. Even the guest path has been well designed to offer a unique experience among heavenly nature,"
,,Beautiful waterfall,3.0,,"Beautiful waterfall, however very difficult to take photos as water sprays everywhere. Also decide your visit as day time or night time, reason being photos doesn't come out so good at night due to the lighting, day time better for photos.

The price was bit on the high side considering what was on offer. What can I say tourist attraction!"
,,Cloud Forrest Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Go visit this Dome and the Flower Dome next door. Lots of plants and rocks to learn about. Great feature of the Cloud Dome is lifts for those unable to manage the walks to the top of the Dome. An easy way to get amongst the tree tops.
,,BEST MAN MADE MARVELS,5.0,,It is a temperature controlled structure. You can find here different kinds of plants you see in the real forest. As we near the top I saw different kinds of pitcher plants. The welcoming high waterfalls welcomes you as you enter.
,,Most Spectacular Architecture in Singapore,5.0,,Visited this famous place in the hot day is super relaxing since it has good air con. The architecture is breathtaking. Make sure you go to the top cloud sky walk when you visit this place.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,What else is there to say about this place? A Must-see in Singapore! We thought it would be like any other greenhouse and be very hot but it was actually a lot colder inside than outside. We could have spent all day in there!
,,Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,If you miss this you have not seen Singapore at it finest .Beautifully maintained and the flower carvings inside are just fantastic and such a variety from all over the world under one roof .
,,"A concentrate of nature, architecture and beauty that will leave you amazed.",5.0,,"""It's a garden, how exciting a garden could ever be?"" I thought just before getting in. How wrong I was! This is no ordinary garden. It's more like a museum of spectacular nature and, despite being man-made, resembles the most beautiful natural sceneries in the world. Definitely worth a visit."
,,"If you are in the area, then go ahead.",3.0,,"This is another attraction in the Maria Bay area. This is a giant man-made indoor waterfall. It is awesome to behold but having to line up in a very long queue made it a not so good experience for us. We just took pictures by the base of the waterfall and promptly left the place. I would recommend this to young kids and adults because elderly may have issues going up to the top of the waterfalls, I see they have lifts but the sheer crowd of people didn't make the experience worth it. I would still recommend visiting this at least once if you are a tourist in Singapore and happen to be in the area. But it is definitely not a place you would want to keep coming back to unless you were into man-made waterfalls."
,,Fabulous concept.,4.0,,We really enjoyed our visit to the Cloud Forest. Get there early to avoid the crowds and you can then also get great photos and be leisurely. The views from all levels are really good. The largest indoor waterfall in the world greets you as you enter - definitely a great photo opportunity. The ticket also allows you to go in and out if you get your hand stamped for re entry. The Misting session at 10am wasn’t very much mist so we went back at 12 and it was similar.
,,Beautiful place - out of this world,5.0,,This is the most amazing garden /forest. The structure is quite amazing with so many different plants and a waterfall. You get amazing views from the top and you can take a leisurely walk down enjoying all the beautiful plants and the wonderful views.
,,A must visit place,5.0,,"During our first visit to Singapore we missed going here, but really glad we visited on our second visit. There are two forests and both are stunning in there own right. It is far bigger than I anticipated and was nice to be air conditioning which was a pleasant surprise. The variety of plants and trees is huge and when you see the waterfall you will be stunned. Absolutely fantastic"
,,Great sight to see in Singapore,4.0,,"We had a great time walking around the cloud forest during the day. It was a spectacle to see walking into the dome and seeing and hearing the huge waterfall straight away. It was great to cool Off from the outside heat and it was great to walk to the top and see it from both perspectives learning on the way too.
Great way to spend a couple of hours in Singapore. Better than the flower garden for me was the cloud forest. But both are a great way to spend time."
,,cool escapre from the heat,5.0,,The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are the two main attractions at Gardens By The Bay. The admission for both domes was $28. For $3 you can add a shuttle ride back to the MRT. I walked to the domes from the Bayfront MRT and it was about a 3/4 mile hike. Both domes have air conditioning and provide a cool escape from the heat in Singapore. The flora in both domes is beautiful and is well worth the price of admission.
,,Impressive,5.0,,"One of the most impressive places I've seen. Beautiful sights, interesting facts and a great view. 10/10"
,,Cloud Forest - Imaginative concept,4.0,,"Whilst the flower dome was interesting, I think the concept of the Cloud Forest was imaginative and spectacular. Filled with plants soaring from above as you walk down the ramp, it was quite a sight.
Again, the displays are changed according to the themes and be aware of closing days to avoid disappointments. We went on a Saturday morning and it was not overly crowded.
If you have time for just one place, I’d choose the Cloud Forest.
This is an excellent tourist attraction for Singapore."
,,Refreshing!,5.0,,"Walking into the Cloud Forest from outside, out of the oppressive heat, and being met by the cool mist of the waterfall... oh, what a feeling. Just terrific. A beautiful sanctuary!"
,,Insanely beautiful,5.0,,"We went here during the day and the night - I’d recommend it if you really like plants. Try and go during the misting which is really cool. The board walks go up to the top of the forest and you walk down. Beautifully maintained, a must visit!!"
,,Spectacular Cloud Forest,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is a must see in Singapore. It is magnificent. The displays are fascinating and well worth a visit by all ages. Breathtaking. Even air conditioned!
,,Infinitely Beautiful,5.0,,Singapore always manages to amaze me. What you think is inconceivable is happening in a city where there is no waterfall. They build it ...... Indoors !!!! And also wonderful !!!! An advice. Go there because it deserves the trip.
,,In the Clouds,5.0,,Cloud Forrest attraction at Gardens by the Bay is a pleasant stroll around the tropical climate of a well kept indoor garden.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"I visit cloud forest in the afternoon of a hot day and it was very cool inside.
The main attraction here is a man- made waterfall which is very high. You will get to the top of the waterfall by escalator and go downward to visit all the plants, tree, flower in the waterfall. The view from the walkway down is breathtaking. There's also a cinema and a museum there to show you movie and document about saving our planet.
You can spend around 2-3 hour visit this attraction and it's well worth the money"
,,Good to cool down,4.0,,It’s really beautiful especially the waterfall. It’s a nice temperature too. However once you go in it’s difficult to get out before the end and there aren’t many places to sit down.
,,Clever,5.0,,Very clever and very pretty and you can walk all the way up which is really fun. A talk about the effects of recycling and saving the planet at the end is really inspiring too! Great place to visit
,,Great for a short visit,4.0,,"A cool (literally) place to go, the plants were very interesting and the walk down on the raised platforms was exciting. We are not really excited by plants and gardens generally but this experience was well worth it."
,,Nice place to cool down!,5.0,,The waterfall and indoor structure are a nice place to visit. The structure is actually a nice place to cool down from the hot humid SG.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Well worth the few $ entry. Amazing waterfall and just spectacular gardens and walk ways! And it’s nice and cool!
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Amazing architecture that allows you to walk above the beautiful gardens for a very modest fee. Highly recommended
,,"Enclosed forest, Artificial Falls",5.0,,"For S$14 entrance fee, one can go inside one of the 2 domed attractions inside the Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest. There are locker rooms available before entering where you can leave your things and to have a more comfortable walk inside. Upon entering, one is greeted by the 35-meter waterfalls. Then you proceed to the elevator to take you to the 6th level and from there explore this contained rainforest from the top going down. You will go through spiralling walkways suspended high up in the air and have a 360 degree walk to see the plants and trees growing inside this man-made forest. Once in a while you will feel the mist on your face, just like when you are walking inside a real forest. There is also a theater inside showing how one can help protect the environment and an area where stalactites and stalagmites are contained to have a feel of being inside a cave. A great attraction this Cloud Forest, both from inside and out."
,,Incredible,5.0,,Such a smart concept and done so well. They get heaps of people through there in an efficient and stress-free manner which is to be applauded. Loved it.
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,Everything is just so beautiful and massive. Whole garden is so manicured and well designed. Great to do if you have a rainy day - you're inside - yet so much water to attract the eye.
,,Great place,5.0,,"Amazing day out, cannot believe what is in there, its huge. Lots for everyone to do & see.Though some of the walkways were a bit too high for me!"
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,The cloud forest was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore absolutely beautiful place where I have not seen anywhere else.
,,Not a gardener but lovely to see,5.0,,Im not a gardener or a fan it was lovely to see however if you're on a budget and not a garden fan give it a miss and walk around the free botanical gardens instead including children's free playground with water fountains to play and cool down in.
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,Cloud forest is part of the garden by the way. its a man made forest inside the dome. entry is paid.
,,Simply Amazing!,5.0,,"This is one of the two domes at Gardens by the Bay; the other being Flower Dome (which is also worth a visit if you have the time). All the flowers are displayed all around the centre masterpiece, which is this six-storey waterfall. The spray from the waterfall is very refreshing, especially on a hot afternoon when we visited. You can get a discounted price if you were to buy a combined ticket to both Domes."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"Once you enter, you are greeted by a pretty spectacular waterfall. The temperature in the cloud forest is also quite noticeably cooler compared to the outside temperature so I would suggest to bring a thin cardigan along. I would say that this place is quite educational for both adults and children and everyone would be able to take away some new interesting piece of information from the various boards introducing diff types of plants."
,,Very well designed and arranged - a must visit,5.0,,"Alongwith Gardens by the bay, it is also housed inside a huge air-conditioned dome. Spread over six floors, it offers a variety of natural plus man made attraction which are soothing to the eye. A must visit."
,,"Best place in the town , treat for eyes",5.0,,Dancing with the greenaries all over best place to get the feel of medeterian... Wonderful place for anyone and everyone. Worth the visit
,,Stare In Wonder,4.0,,"This place is a sight for sore eyes! You can't quite believe what you are seeing inside a building. Beautiful, natural, tranquil and a healthy way to spend an afternoon. Plenty of other things to do nearby and some good cafes to take a break."
,,futuristic,5.0,,go there for the evening visit. It's even more utopistic than if you go there during the day. Fantastic views and amazing structure...
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The cloud forest is in the port park and is a pay to enter, the park is free. We spent several hours there enjoying the variety of plants, displays, water features, crystals and rainforest atmosphere."
,,Great experience and highly recommended,5.0,,"It was something new to experience, cool and exciting. Good waterfall and good collection of green plants."
,,Yearly tour,5.0,,Excellent trip Singapore one should visit once in life time .not to mention one spot every place is tourist spot .clean sparkling Singapore .get a chance I will surly visit again
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Our favorite part were the supertrees outside (admission free), but if you're willing to pay the faily high admission for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, these are worth one-time visit. It's basically a waterfall, some flowers and a short walk on high bridges."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Great place to spend some time wondering around and enjoying the marvel that has been created and maintained.
,,a trip to paradise,5.0,,"beautiful and huge flowers house, amazing environment, where you can see a lot of plants and flowers almost like in their own environment."
,,Must see!,5.0,,Just must see) dont want say much) incredible and impressive. Need around 1 hour for here. Have shuttle car from metro. Easy to find. Walk from metro (Bayfront) around 15 mins. Also worth walking. Better to see during the day. Evening also nice. Can see Supertree light show (must!) at 7.45 or 8.45 pm.
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,Bought tickets to this and the Flower Dome. Both were interesting with plenty to see and stroll at your leisure.
,,World's Largest Indoor Waterfall!,5.0,,"Singapore's Cloud Forest offers breathtaking mountain-like views, lush vegetation, and waterfalls! While I was there, I learned that the Cloud Forest touts the world’s largest indoor waterfall. I could have spent hours wandering around the Cloud Forest dome; I recommend going in the late afternoon and watching sunset from within the dome itself."
,,The Water fall,5.0,,"This was a surprize when we got inside, a giant water fall, give fantastic pictures ,views from the top well worth going up"
,,Realaxing day,3.0,,It was ok but nothing special.u can go there but is not realy importent if u in sq.better.u use ur time other place.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Worth a visit. This is very well done. Easily accessible for all, lots to see and a wonderful thought invoking display about green house effects on the planet"
,,Stunning even if you thought you aren't a 'flower person'!,5.0,,"This brilliant, interesting, immaculately tended garden, waterfall and walkways is a must see. The meandering bridges and walkways take you on a journey of plants, orchids, flowers and mist and around a central waterfall feature. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the Cloud Forest and how long I was in there looking at the exquisite detail of the hundreds of types of orchids and plants. As a bonus it is comfortably cool so is a lovely respite from Singaporean heat. Very enjoyable."
,,Crowd Forest,5.0,,"Super great air in there. You'll know what I mean if you're in Singapore. Elevator friendly, limited steps, mostly ramps."
,,Simply the best,5.0,,"What a feast for your eyes. I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the cloud forest. It is cool, refreshing and appeals to all the sensors. Purchase a two conservatory pass for $28pp. You can’t anticipate what you will see. Catch the MRT and get off at Bayfront on the Circle Line. Exit via the escalator and you are in the Gardens."
,,WOW,5.0,,"We went to both the garden dome and cloud, it was very stupid that either was close on days we went and we had to come back other day for other and didn't get offered discount. AC so it's very nice to do during the day in hot Singapore. We loved this one, so many great photos, I would skip the garden one next door if I had to choose (unless it was same price for both) But this one is a must! So cool!"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"We thoroughly loved this, two huge buildings with plants from around the world. The waterfall in the building, is the largest indoor waterfall in the world. There are a lot of sculptures in the various layouts inside and these are beautifully placed in the gardens. Well worth the money."
,,"Excellent!""",5.0,,Its like the Rain forest under one roof. Excellent for all the family although completely safe some parts are very high and not for Vertigo suffers
,,Indoor Forest,5.0,,"Indoor forest consist of few tiers of floor with great view and a magical place to be in especially in the misting period where it looks stunning on the top floor. Very good place for photogenic shots or just enjoying the nature without being outside, wear jacket or thicker clothing as it can get very cold inside the forest."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Each of the domes at Gardens by the Bay are pretty cool. This one especially when entering and seeing/feeling the waterfall. Wear some non-slip shoes.
,,Don’t miss it,5.0,,This is part of the Singapore Gardens by the Bay. The water fall is wonderful. Don’t miss taking the elevator up and walking down. The vies of the city and the ‘Cloud” are worth it.
,,Incredible,5.0,,So amazing place! they have a waterfall inside. Is incredible see how they created he nature from nothing! love it so much.
,,Worth the cost,5.0,,"One of two domes you pay to go into at the gardens by the bay. We found it fantastic and worth every penny. I highly recommend this. Also, you can get your hand stamped if you leave the dome and re-enter as often as you wish on the day(including evening)."
,,Waterfall was amazing,5.0,,The cloud forest was amazing with the waterfall a great spectacle. The walk through was a different concept to the flower dome.
,,magical,5.0,,"this place is out of this world! it was a great haven for us from the Singapore heat. we didn't want to leave because the waterfall is so mesmerizing. it is a bit cooler here, so if you get cold easily recommend bringing a light sweater. you can walk all the way to the top of the waterfall and learn about the environment."
,,A must see,5.0,,"Just beautiful. The orchids and LEGO pool display were incredible. Go at your own pace, so much to take in."
,,Top 5,5.0,,"This is an amazing experience whether your interested in rain forest and plants, or architecture ... or not. The experience is fascinating. And it is also cooler than the standard Singapore 30C degrees."
,,Refreshing visit,5.0,,"I came in the afternoon at it's rather hot outside. But upon entering this place, you're greeted with the waterfall and the water mist instantly cools you down.

I love walking along the path, surrounded by beautiful beautiful plants. Plenty of lovely orchids and other plants that soothes the eye and also great material for your Instagram pictures.

Worth a visit, especially if you can appreciate plants and flowers."
,,Sight seeing,5.0,,"We had this packaged with the Gardens visit, a must see while you are in this area and unbelievable what they have packed into this dome, plenty to see and inspire."
,,cool flowers,5.0,,"Singapore weather is too hot but the moment I get here, I forget the heat. a cool place The flowers were so pretty and varied that I was surprised."
,,Phenomenal,5.0,,"This was phenomenal and well worth the $28 to visit both here and the flower dome. We spent around 2 hours here but could easily have spent longer, each part is truly fantastic and the detail that has been put into it is amazing. This is a must go to if you are in Singapore."
,,Unfortunately man made attractions can't compete with nature,3.0,,It was ok..maybe we didnt get the hype seeing as we live in the tropics with waterfalls and rainforests so I guess if you live in a city then this is a chance to experience that. It was nice escaping the city to see all the greenery and the aircon inside us a welcome relief.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"It is one of the Domes located within Gardens By The bay Complex.What a relief from the heat and humidity of the city. Loved the waterfall at the very entrance and all the flora. Gives you the real feeling of being in a forest. Go to the upper floor, its well worth the views."
,,Spectacular waterfall,5.0,,This is one of the inside spaces at marina bay gardens. Initially struck by the height of the cloud forest. You can go up in th3 lift to the top and walk down through fantastic displays. Really worth doing and would say do not miss it.
,,"Beautiful flowers - only ""mists"" every two hours",4.0,,"This garden was beautiful and unique. Note the ""misting"" schedule at the front entrance or you'll miss the ""clouds""."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"One thing to see is the Cloud Forest, this is unique and magic. You can imagine yourself in the amazone and feel the nature"
,,Rain forest and Tropical environment under one roof,5.0,,Great to see the extent of preservation. The flora is outstanding. Great place to take photo graphs.
,,Architecture wins!,4.0,,"I was there over the weekend and it was super crowded. Please don't go if you want some quiet moments. However, I loved the whole idea of promoting the green land which Singapore always do! Good to have a look"
,,Crazy project...,4.0,,"Reproduce a cloud forest in the heart of Singapore was a crazy idea.. but it is awesome! Located inside the Gardens by the Bay, It transports you in the middle of the Amazon. The visit takes about 2 hours and it's really worth it !"
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"A lot of thought has gone into this and depending on the times you visit, they spray the trees from hidden pipes so that is what gives the cloud forest it's name. As at times it looks and feels like you are walking through the clouds. Definitely recommend a visit."
,,SO COOL!,5.0,,The photo i posted was from the entrance of the cloud forest dome. It’s a super cool exhibit that you get to walk up and through the giant green waterfall. It’s honestly breathtaking.
,,Well worth the money,5.0,,"Is there anyone who wouldn't like this? It's cooling - an oasis from the weather outside. It's attractive. It's environmental. It is busy - but there are many taking photos for Instagram so it is popular. And it's impressive what they've done and the range of plants and design inside.

The ubiquitous shop is at the end, but they also have nice pieces. Recommended!"
,,Cool place to visit,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is located within the Gardens By the Bay complex.

The Cloud Forest is housed within a futuristic looking building made of steel and glass.
It has air conditioning and so it really is a cool place literally. There is a gently sloping path to the top. There is also a lift that takes you to the top. I saw escalators too.

There are many varieties of plants and flowers. As you look outside, you can see the Singapore River and the Flyer. You also get good views of the Marina Bay Sands building sand the Supertree Grove.

The Cloud Forest has been well designed and you could easily spend half a day here and not notice the time pass by.

This is a must see attraction."
,,Wow!,5.0,,This place is amazing! So beautiful and well kept. The waterfall is man made but really cool. The Cloud Forrest is right next to the Flower Dome are right next to each other and you can buy a combined ticket. There is free WiFi here. Would definitely visit again.
,,A break from the heat,4.0,,"Nice put together attraction. I had the Joni Mitchell song in my head, Big Little Taxi: They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum
And then they charged the people a dollar-and-a-half just to see 'em

Kinda fitting, as this is basically a tree museum. Then you go through a part where you see the destruction of rain forests etc. I cried at that point."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,This place is a must see in Singapore if you are staying their I would have to suggest it as a must to in this country
,,cool place,5.0,,was amazing place well thought out would definitely go again absolutely love the whole area though the flower plaza opposite a bit tacki would definitely take kids I took my 14 year old daughter need a full day to appreciate it all
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,It was so interesting to see plants that I normally don’t see in their natural habitat being a gardener it also gave me a great source of inspiration However it is a very busy place and was a welcome change from the Singapore heat
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"So this is my second time visiting The Cloud Forest and the changes since May 2017 are subtle but significant. For example: the growth over and through many of the carved tree roots have added so much to the visual beauty.

I didn't spend as much time reading all the plaques on this trip, but did notice a couple of new ones with good information about the habitats.

Once again I think this is a must do if you have a spare few hours in Singapore city."
,,Nice mix of variety of flora.,5.0,,"Great place to relax and enjoy nature. All types of plants and trees with a nice, very high waterfall. Learn how global warming can be fought."
,,Unreal,5.0,,"Another Singapore ""must visit"", a nice reprieve from the heat and a great selection of tropical plants."
,,Learning the nature,5.0,,"Actually, I had misunderstood of this nature museum. This was not only nature museum to see objects, but taught me a lot of learning of nature wonderfulness and climate crisis. I recommend kids and their parents to come here to study those."
,,Totally a Must to Do in Singapore,5.0,,"This was just so fabulous, you can hardly believe all you can see, it was fun watching the city change from day til evening, the views of the area are vast, north, south, east and west, fabulous to take lots of Singapore photos and search out different things you’ve seen. A must do on your trip"
,,Loved it,5.0,,"This was a really interesting exhibit. The whole thing is built on reclaimed land, but they've re-created the high mountain forest environment that is rapidly disappearing from planet earth as a consequence of our obsession with ""cheap"" fossil fuel.

The artificial waterfall creates a high mist environment that mimics a rainforest at altitude. Obviously, this is adjacent to the sea, but they've set it up well, and it is prolific with different plants thriving in the moisture rich air, and they've put good information throughout the exhibits so that you get something of an education as you meander around the artificial mini-mountain in the clouds. Really imaginative, and like a live rainforest. The only thing that would make it more authentic would be the leeches you get in a real rainforest :)

We loved it.

You need a real camera if you want to take photos. Smart phones fall short because the light is way too bright for their feeble flashes to fill a close subject surrounded by super bright light."
,,Spectacular indoor gardens in Singapore,5.0,,"Visit the Cloud Forest in Singapore, well worth going to. You will climb up a series of ramps amongst tropical plants. The design allows you to be inside a forest, enev though it is all man made it does work. Bad Cats of Brissy"
,,Not Bad,3.0,,"An okay place to visit if you are already in the area. I would not make a special trip, very basic set up, although the cool air is a nice break from the humidity."
,,Amazing beyond belief,5.0,,One of the two Superdomes in the Gardens By The Bay. As son as you enter you are greeted by a 35m tall waterfall which you will enter and get a lift to the top and slowly decend back down internally simulating walking down from a 2000m high rainforest mountain. Plants and orchids you won't see anywhere else on Earth are everywhere. Amazing fails to be adequate.
,,Just like the 'lost boys' mountain.,5.0,,"Don't go if you are afraid of heights, as the walkways go up a long way. You really need your walking shoes on- but worth the effort when you stand at the top of the waterfall."
,,Incredible- educative and quite stunning,5.0,,"Really enjoyed this experience. It was firstly just so lovely and cool in the dome which was a relief from the muggy Singaporean humidity. It was so well created and researched that my husband and I both found it fascinating and enjoyable- and he’s not really a gardening or ecology enthusiast. It would be a marvellous place to bring school-aged children. There were all types of mixed media used to give messages about fossil fuels, how to recycle etc- in detailed but catchy ways . I’d like to return to assimilate more information.
We also went in the flower dome but found that to be a lot less interesting than the Cloud dome."
,,Cooling and enjoyable,5.0,,Loved the atmosphere....we went on a rainy day so it got really cold. Do bring an jacket if youre going after a rain
,,Impressive,5.0,,Part of gardens by the bay. Very beautiful and puts greenhouses to a different level. A must do whilst in Singapore
,,Stunning and interesting,5.0,,What a great concept and well executed. The scenery was outstanding and the information presented was excellent. Well worth the entrance fee.
,,Amazing Concept,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest in the Gardens by the Bay is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore. They have built a tropical cloud forest inside a dome with a 30 meter waterfall inside. As you spiral your way down from the top, reached via elevator you see the changes in the flora of a cloud forest. It is a wonderful way to spend several hours. Also it is climate controlled inside the dome. We expected it to be humid and hot but to the contrary was very comfortably air conditioned simulating the environment high in the mountains."
,,"Amazing, a must see!",5.0,,"This place is a must see! If you are heading to Singapore, definitely ensure it is on your list. It was a magical experience and so well crafted! Just the size of the dome itself is amazing! A perfect place to escape the heat also as the 2 domes are air conditioned to the maximum. Worth taking a jumper with you while you are inside!"
,,Cloud Forest,4.0,,"Cloud forest dome is situated next to flower dome at marina bays. The artificial waterfall is the main attraction in the dome. The dome is full of different types of plants and you can feel the freshness in the air. It has cloud walkways at heights which are really amazing!

Its worth visit once !"
,,Nice artificial garden,4.0,,Very nice garden and unbelievable architecture of this place High quality and very well operation Recommend to visit it Special when the weather is sunny and out outside
,,Great,5.0,,"Very atmospheric, lovely enjoyable place to wander around, reasonably priced and you could spend hours there"

,,Amazing,5.0,,very nice place to visit. the waterfall is literally breathtaking. worth every penny. I recommend it highly.
,,Lovely and worth the visit,5.0,,I went on a Sunday afternoon. There was a line but it moved quickly. It is very beautiful and definitely worth the trip.

,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Wonderful experience , walking through and around these beautiful orchids, the entrance has a magnificent waterfall."
,,I was amazed,5.0,,What a great way to spend some time out of the heat .This was amazing . The flowers the latout great job .
,,A must-see!!,5.0,,"You have to see this when you come to Singapore! What an awe-inspiring structure! We really enjoyed our visit, walking around and enjoying the waterfall. It does get pretty cold in here so I advise getting a wrap or a cardigan."
,,This is a truly beautiful heaven,5.0,,"If you are visiting Sing, this one is a must - perhaps best combined with your visit to Gardens by The Bay. There is plenty to see, especially if you visit around the tie of a flower show.

I would suggest that you start here, and then go to the Gardens by The bay aftet dark. Although it is doable with kids, I would have thought that these venues are mote for adults, simply by the virtue of the amount of walking involved.

Enjoy!!"
,,Mesmering,5.0,,Rely enjoyed this well worth the admission fee. Puts somewhere like kew gardens in the shade. Beautiful covered dome.
,,Great therapeutic,5.0,,"The walk was great and seems surreal. To use modern architecture, natural botany and bringing people close to a forest in an air conditioned glass building is an architectural and therapeutic feat. Worth the visit!"
,,Just OK for me.,2.0,,"Everyone seemed to love this but having been in real cloud forests in South and Central America, this did not amaze me. Go but not high on my Singapore must do list."
,,Busy. Time it right for the cloud experience,4.0,,Definitely recommend but it’s very busy as the rate limiting step is the elevator to the top (no option to take stairs). However once at the top you can wander down at your own pace. Amazing scenery and lots of little hidden bits you don’t see on your way up. Educational for young ones too. Time your visit right if you want to experience the cloud effect though. Happened every few hours.
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,Breathtaking multi-sensory experience. This was my second visit and enjoyed it just as much as the first time.
,,Nice and beautiful,4.0,,A spectacular indoor waterfall and exotic plants. Nice to take a walk through this beautiful place and enjoy the sounds of nature.

,,always a great experience,5.0,,We've been many times but always worth it- spectacular architecture and a refreshing walk. Good cool activity in Singapore- a rarity.
,,Favourite,5.0,,Cloud forest was probably my favourite out of the two Domes. The climb up and learning about the different plants was enjoyable. Always enjoyable being around a waterfall an opportunities for good photos
,,The highlight of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"If your time is limited and you want to experience Gardens by the Bay, make sure you visit the Cloud Forest dome. An elevator takes you to the top and you then meander down an elevated circuitous path that provides exhilarating views."
,,Outstanding,4.0,,We thought only a few hours here but how wrong we were. Lots to fill your whole day. The cloud forest was fabulous with plants from all over the world. The displays were well kept and we saw plants being cared for and replaced. When the cloud is released it makes a very calm atmosphere. A must do.
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,A great spot to escape the heat and enjoy an amazing display or fauna from many parts of the world. It is really well done

,,Breath taking,5.0,,You must visit if you go to gardens by the bay. It's well worth the cost. I'm scared of heights therefore my knees went a bit funny when looking down from the top but I felt safe enough. One of the highlights of our trip.
,,Unique Must Seen Botanical Gardens,5.0,,Part of the Garden by the Bay Complex this is an ecological and botanical wonder. Unique in its three story structure and waterfalls. Also a good offering of ecology preservation efforts in the way of short films and postings throughout. Great place to take pictures. A little pricey and no senior citizen price breaks for non resident Singaporeans.
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,This pace is amazing. Do isit this when u go to gradens by the bay. The place is VERY chilled but the feeling u get inside is amazing.. Beautiful work of man. Enjoy
,,Memorable visit,5.0,,"We had just completed our visit to the Flower Dome and thought that Cloud Forest surely couldn't be close enough to the spectacle but were we surprised. As soon as we entered the dome, we just stood there with amazement. The view was stunning and we were completely mesmerized. Spent a most wonderful couple of hours here and ultimately left only because we had prior bookings elsewhere."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Great activity to do and a must see. Was absolutely beautiful. Was impressed with the variety and loved reading about all the plant.
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"This is part of the Bay Gardens complex and well worth a visit. The Bay Gardens themselves are free, but the cloud forest is a bit special. Take the MRT to Bay Front, and you can walk through the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to get to it."
,,What a great piece of an art,4.0,,This place is so mesmerising.. really the way cloud forest is made is surely amazing and quite beautiful.. 30 ft long waterfall is just to look for and a delight .. post which u can use elevator to go up till top of the cloud forest and get down via sky walk which is made of glass tiles and it’s really amazing .. u can watch the waterfall from a very rear distance and plants and all along with it.. the moment U enter this heaven u go to other world only .. u get completely lost and enjoyed every bit of it.. if u have a height fobia then don’t dare to look down from glass walk.. u can also have beautiful series of pictures. In the ground floor they have real rock formation samples to see and experience .. this is must when in Singapore
,,So Beautiful,5.0,,Just Amazing...Long walk but its worth it. Its an amazing Idea Singapore offering for Foreigners. Wonderful!
,,Visited as part of a trip to Gardens By The Nay,5.0,,"Preferred the Cloud Forest to the Cloud Garden (which had unnecessary Disney-esque type structures that detracted from the beauty of the flowers). It was fascinating to take a walk up and around the fountains and on the sky walkway. We pre booked a ticket for both of the domes, and the skybridge in the Gardens via Groupon. Well worth a look."
,,unreal,5.0,,"As you walk in you are greeted by a 35ft waterfall that takes your eye before moving on and seeing the incredible range of orchids, pitcher plants and ferns from cool moist tropical areas.Climb to the top of the waterfall and walk around the roof looking down on the amazing plants."
,,Fun time,5.0,,"It’s a nice experience. Everything is very organized, cleaned and beautiful. Flowers from all around the world and amazing waterfalls at the entrance! The only disappointed part was the cloud they suppose to create every certain time.. nothing special. The rest of the forest is really beautiful and interested!"
,,waterfall is magical!!,5.0,,worth the visit and the money. the waterfall inside this cloud forest is just magical. it is so cooling and calm inside.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Loved the cloud forest! Its nice and cool inside so a break from the heat outside. Fascinating to see all the different types of vegetation from all over the world. We don't have any children but the kids looked like they really enjoyed themselves. It was a shame the flower dome was closed the day we went for maintenance.
,,Completely blown away,5.0,,"This place is incredible. You step inside and are greeted by a massive waterfall, filling the cool air with mist, and surrounding by lush greenery... it's like another world entirely. I could have spent all day in here. Take the lift up to the top and work your way back down the levels. Definitely make sure you take the time to enjoy the secret garden right down the bottom"
,,Perfectly lovely,4.0,,Refreshingly new idea great to see definitely should add to list of things to do visited in the evening with all the lights
,,So High up in the clouds,5.0,,I also visited the cloud forrest in July 18. If you don't mind heights then go see all the beautiful plants that are there.
,,Visit 2nd after Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,this is a beautiful tour. takes around 2 hours. lots of things to learn and see. kids will love it. do the tour in the evening around 5.30 or 6 onwards. you can go to both with the ticket.
,,Best Attraction in the Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"By far a must visit attraction among the many at the gardens by the bay. A climate controlled environment comprising of many flora varieties including even carnivorous species. Offers breath taking view of the Singapore Flyer, Marine Bay Sands and the Supertree Grove. The waterfall is and all the additions make it a real hill station experience. Must Visit!!!"
,,Refreshing,4.0,,It is a must to visit this one. However can get very crowded and a bit tiring. So make sure to spend whole day at your own leisure at gardens by the bay/
,,World Class display of gardening,5.0,,"We have been to the Cloud Forest a few times and are never disappointed. It is a fantastic sensory overload of amazing and beautiful plants. Some special and rare plants can be seen here, which are generally found in higher elevations in Asia.
I imagine humans settling another planet, like Mars, where we would live under a dome, or underground. The cloud forest gardeners have proven that humans can create an engineered artificial environment, to sustain non-native plant life. When humans are ready to colonize Mars, the expedition should include some of the cloud forest gardeners!
My favorite garden, the pitcher plants (top level) is spoiled by the ugly, tacky display of Legos distributed throughout the planters. Yuck. Please remove these eyesores!

Also, many of your customers find the display of stalactites and stalagmites offensive. We assume these are real and were removed from a cave, which certainly spoiled the cave."
,,Magical !!!,5.0,,It was indeed a wonderful experience ... it’s a “must “visit place in Singapore ... the temperature was really cold inside... the greenery and the natural flowers were awesome ...
,,Love it!,5.0,,I love this attraction so much. Amazing + unforgettable and you won’t be able to find this kind of attraction anywhere else.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Loved the Cloud Forest, was a great way to get out of the heat and the waterfall, plants and carvings dotted around were absolute beautiful."
,,Wonderful experience!,5.0,,"Yet another high quality, extremely well presented attraction in SIngapore. Dovetails in very well with a vist to the Botanic Gardens and the adjacent Flower Dome."
,,Really great place to visit,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit, and if you’re trying to decide whether this or the Flower Dome we’d say Cloud Forest. (Having said that we’re not flower people; my wife may disagree because I don’t buy enough.)
This place is really well laid out, and the plants are amazing.
For us it was money well spent."
,,Very nice,5.0,,"It is really very beautiful and cold inside , i love the dragons in this area. The flowers are all very well taken care of."
,,Fab garden in the clouds,5.0,,"Loved our visit here... wonderful gardens, lovely walk, heaps of interest and quite unique. Avoid the high platforms if you are not comfortable with heights. Great audiovisual presentation... amazing plants and stunning garden."
,,Recommended to all humans,5.0,,This is the sort of installation that should be present in all major cities of the world. Outstanding. Provides an education and insight for all ages into impacts of humanity on the world as well as showcasing local flora in an interesting and dynamic structure.
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is well worth a first look the disappointing thing was the constant stopping because of selfie takers and not just for one photo. Not sure that I would race back for a second time, but pleased we went all the same."
,,Amazing Waterfall,5.0,,This is an amazing place and the work that has gone into making the indoor waterfall is amazing. It really is a beautiful place.
,,worth a peek,4.0,,"We only chose one dome, and this one was worth it. Very imaginative layout, and some interesting information to go through."
,,Cool & inviting,5.0,,"A walk through right to the top and a lesson in the wonder which is the plant life of our wonderful world. Explained so well, children are able to understand the concept of our plant life and how we need to take care to maintain our plant."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Very impressive! The way you climb to the top and see plants which grow at all altitudes. The buildings themselves are very impressive - the whole design is fabulous. We went with our 5 year old daughter and she was kept interested the whole time. Part of Gardens on the bay this is really worth a visit!
,,Don't Missed Cloud Frost,5.0,,"If you have sometimes make a visit, its worth, to spend 1 or 2 hours, the entrance ticket cost S$ 16/- per adult. I am sure if you are a nature lover you want regret it, enjoy"
,,Refreshing Mist,5.0,,"We visited the Gardens at the Bay to see what is in the glass domes. The outdoor ""trees"" i find quite underwhelming at daytime, where they indeed appear as steel trees - or better cones - only. They do come to life more at night with lighting.

We entered the cloud forest dome first. How refreshing it was. Not just because of the waterfall right at the entrance but because of the really fresh climate in the dome.

The walk brings you up to the top of the mountain via lifts and you wlak down you way through the different areas.

You will have nice and varying views on the way down and lovers of - here predomiantly green - nature will enjoy. So did i / we!

While it is a nice experience, it is after all - only? - a large greenhouse, well designed and well marketed and i personally prefer Kew Gardens Palmhouse in Londeon or the Palmegarten Greenhouse in Frankfurt / Main. It was a nice experience but no reason for so much hype - a clear case of form over function. The form is very nice indeed though!

The merchadise area one is channeled through - without any chance of escape - is a but much though....

In Singapore still a ""must-see"""
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay is a must stop for any tourist in Singapore, the large tree like structures which create a vertical garden are amazing and the two domes are stunning the cloud forest being the best of them with its artificial waterfall and snaking pathways throughout the dome."
,,Off-it's-head! Absolutely amazing!,5.0,,"Worth every cent of the ticket price ($28 for this and the Flower Conservatory together). An incredible feat of design, engineering and botany! People told us this was good but I couldn't comprehend it until I saw it myself."
,,Must see,5.0,,"This was an amazing experience. Loved the plants that grow at cloud level. Lots to learn, great display around climate change. We both hate heights but bravely managed the cloud walk."
,,Very Good experiences.,5.0,,"A must do. I am afraid of heights, but managed to get around on the sky walk in the clouds. Take your time heaps of photos to take"
,,Do this as a part of the whole day,5.0,,As my previous post. We did this attraction as part of the whole day and evening and offer that it is the best way to do. We missed the misting cloud and now we will need to go back. Well that's my excuse and I will stick to it.
,,Just amazing,4.0,,"This is a pay to enter option in the Gardens by the Bay complex and one that I am glad we visited.

Upon entering, you are greeted by an amazing waterfall that is both cooling & spectacular.

I am sure that you could spend hours here if you wanted to, but for a ‘walk-through’ it probably takes around 30 to 45 minutes.

The (optional) elevated walkway takes you under and behind the waterfall and you see to just keep climbing up into the cathedral type space. Probably not for those not good with heights, there are elevators and escalators to bring you back down, at various points.

The plant life is sensational and the nature of the place is that it will keep changing and evolving as plants grow and develop."
,,Amazing a must if you visit Singapore,5.0,,"Garden by the Bay is definitely a must experience if you are in Singapore
Not only the outdoor area has beautiful gardens but the two domes gardens of the world and the cloud forest will make your visit unforgettable
A suggestion: bring a jacket as inside can be cold as temperatures are controlled for the plants"
,,Eden Project x10,4.0,,"Amazing building and beautiful walk around the feature waterfall. For such a high profile attraction, i was suprised how early it closed - last admission was 8pm - you need a whole day if you want to both gardens and the trees.
Oh...and you must have a head for heights"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,There don't seem words enough to describe this stunning attraction. You have to see and experience all that there is in this amazingly beautiful place. Don't miss it
,,Sci-Fi experience while watching from the bottom up,5.0,,"This Dome has many layers and allows for beautiful pictures. There are also many Asian statues, like dragons etc. which have their meaning in Asian culture. It is a beautiful decorated forest with 5-6 levels. You can see the waterfalls from downstairs and upstairs! All in all a beautiful place to visit!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a must see if you're visiting Singapore, attention to detail is amazing - highly recommended. Tip - buy tickets on headout.com for $5 saving, tix emailed before you go through the queue."
,,Wonderful creation,5.0,,The best man made cloud forest i have ever seen..beautiful waterfall and gardens and much more.entry fees not too expensive and really worth what what you pay for..
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,If you plan to go garden by the bay there are 2 Dome. Flower Dome and Cloud Forest Dome. They are in the same garden but split into 2 Dome. You should not missed either as they are simply beautiful. A place you must go and should go. It's full air con inside and there is a waterfall.
,,Great conservatorium,5.0,,"It such an amazing experience to be here..
Located in the Garden by The Bay, it is a place you have to go when you are in Singapore.

How to get here?
Cloud forest is one of the conservatory that Garden by The Bay have. To reach here, you can choose Bayfront MRT station as your destination (same destination with Marina Bay Sands). It was a clear direction in the exit. So you can easily find the way to get here.
Personally, I recommend you to use shuttle service which takes
SGD 3 per passenger (no fee for my 2 y.o child). Because it will be so hard to to walk in the sunny day by bringing stroller. It also needs more than 15 mins walking. So, shuttle service is the best way. But if you have long time to explore each spot of the Garden by The Bay, it's not a bad choice to walk.

What can be seen here?
You are welcomed by world's tallest indoor waterfall which is very amazing to see. I think this is the best part of Cloud Forest. Cloud forest is surrounded by plants which very beautiful to see.
Your experience will be started in the top platform : Lost World. You can access lift or escalator on each level which have their each view. So easy to whom bringing baby.
Cloud walk is a platform to wrap the artificial mountain. Tree top walk almost the same but it is in a lower level.

☉ When is the best time to go here?
Go in the morning before sun is shining to high. After reaching here, don't worry about the weather because it is a fully air conditioned area.

What is the best outfit?
Wear an outift which comfort you. Casual is the suitable outfit. Because again, you need to walk more here.

Admission
In the official website, the admission is
- SGD 28 for adult
- SGD 15 (3-12 y.o)
- Free for kids under 3 y.o
(The admission for 2 conservatories, incl Flower Dome)

Opening hours
9 am - 9 pm daily
It will takes between 1.5 - 2 hours spending time here"
,,Sensational,5.0,,Unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. This is simply a spectacular feat of natural engineering. Make sure you do the cloud walk and walk around the waterfall.
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,Best place to visit in Singapore. Appreciate everything and be amazed! 😉 Recommend to buy the ticket online to avoid the long queue.
,,Piece of nature in the city,4.0,,Beautiful greenery and the largest indoor man-made waterfall. Greatly educational because you can learn about different types of flora from various parts of the world.
,,Amazing Place To Visit,4.0,,"Be amazed by the man made waterfall and see the different plants, flowers. Best time to visit is late afternoon then proceed to the Super Tree Grove and Be sure to watch the Rhapsody show at 7:45pm or 8:45pm"
,,A must see !,5.0,,One of the latest achivements of mankind! They created a whole ecosystem engineering a microclimate environment in the center of a contemporary busy city such as Singapore. You have to visit..
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"Well worth a visit - and much more than just seeing a whole lot of plants. You would need at least an hour in the conservatory, to wind your way up the path from the ground level entrance, all the way up to the top of the 'mountain'. The Cloud Forest boasts the largest man-made waterfall and it really is Spectacular! The pathway enables you to gradually make your way to the top of the falls, where you look out onto an amazing vista. There are alternate pathways for those not keen on heights.
The plants, creepers, ferns and flowers change in nature the higher you go, just as they do in the rain forests. And the curators have very intelligently made use of LEGO amongst the plants (on the top level) to substantiate the lush growth. This is not a contrived look at all.
We believe it's a must-see during your visit to Singapore.
Colleen and Frank
South Africa."
,,I’m glad I went,5.0,,"This was a great experience, along with the gardens. It’s a must-see! I really enjoyed it and I would recommend others to go there too."
,,"So much beauty, in an amazing space",5.0,,"Had seen this on several TV shows and it doesn't disappoint. The science and engineering involved in the dome construction is awe inspiring on its own, however the orchids and other plants take the experience to a new level.
Make the time to do this, and allocate plenty of time to enjoy it"
,,Engineering marvel,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is best place.
Highly recommended for people who love jungle type - Tarzan movies scenery stuff.
For me Cloud Forest is like Amazon Forest on Cocaine - joking.
I love their water fall , cold breeze on sunny day and nice plants all around the place.
Singaporen love for Green environment can be felt here at this place.
Usually they have some informative movie lecture at the end of the forest tour .
Great place - again highly recommended for environmental friendly people.
Love Singapore"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,Visit here every time I’m in Singapore. Lovely to walk around. Great to visit Day or night. Would recommend it.
,,Excellent Garden,5.0,,You have to see this to belive the hugeness and the beautiful presentations of the gardens. Supurb! It is breathtaking.
,,Relaxed experience in Cloud Forest,5.0,,"I went to Cloud Forest to recce for our company event. It was a hot afternoon thus the Cloud Forest surely offers a cool and relaxing experience. There were local and tourists enjoying their time. Many took pic with the man-made waterfall. What I love best is the ""canopy"" wallk. Not only can i see plant at different level, it also provide a beautiful view of Singapore landscape from afar. At Cloud Forest, there are also other exhibit and awareness video to watch. We get to understand how human activity impacts the environment and what we can do to save the environment. It is indeed a nice refreshing experience."
,,A truly amazing experience.,5.0,,A credit to the city of Singapore. This was truly amazing. To be able to see so many variables under one roof was spectacular.
,,Love it! One of the best parts of Singapore,5.0,,"Largest indoor waterfall. Amazing plants. A nice fun walk around. Cool (at least relative to outside). Everything about this place was great. Well, except people going through 20 pictures for the ""perfect"" selfie. Otherwise though, great experience."
,,Great outing,5.0,,Put those walking shoes on and prepare yourself for a great outing. Definitely worth it. A bit crowded when school trips visit.
,,Highlight of my trip,5.0,,I can't believe how amazing this place is. I wasn't expecting to be blown away like I was. Take an hour or two and mediate in nature. What a place.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great value for money & so refreshing to walk into from the high heat outside. Truly amazing what is on offer here.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Very nice show. Very well arranged and maintained. My granddaughter enjoyed it very much. Must see item.
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,This is something not to be missed. It is an experience to remember for rest of your life. We all loved it. Please check this out.
,,Futuristic Dome,5.0,,When entering the dome you don't realize the sheer size of it ... only after having climbed all the stairs (or take the elevator of course) and have been through all the climate zones you realize the magnitude of this project. You are literally walking trough a rainforest with all its floral species and vegetation. Beautiful sights in the dome itself as well as on the skyline of Singapore with its iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Don't forget to also visit the Flower dome!
,,Amazing sight,3.0,,"I loved the cloud forest, it was like a rain forest we returned to be there at misting time but it was very little mist and nothing that resemble clouds. The flower displays and waterfalls was beautiful"
,,Nice to see,4.0,,"We are really enjoyed this. Had a bit of a moment when the queue said 45 minutes but in reality it took us 10 mins to get to the lift. It was busy when we went on a Friday. I liked the environmental perspective and it is very beautiful. Even if you don’t decide to do this there are still plenty to see and do for free around the Gardens anyway. Great for my kids, age 8 & 5."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was a magic experience. You are in big dome with all sorts of different gardens, crystal garden, walkways of 2 heights , waterfalls. Beautiful photography spots and amazing experiences. Most of it seemed to be wheelchair friendly."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Superb. A must visit. The arrangement is breathtaking, refreshing and beautiful. While in Spore, this attraction is a must. With a waterfall from 110 ft drop, a forested mountain created indoors and marvelous views of Singapore from the walking bridges along the forest hill offer the visitor some worthwhile experience. The environment is air conditioned and makes u feel very comfortable."
,,Absolutely stunning !!!,5.0,,"Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay is certainly one of Singapore’s most impressive attractions. This staggering greenhouse-like glass dome can be seen from miles away, and is just as stunning inside as it is from out.

Even if you’re not an avid flower-enthusiast, a visit to the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay is simply a must - purely to admire the stunning architecture, which is comprised of huge panes of glass set within massive steel grids – with no concrete columns in sight. The neighbouring Flower Dome is actually the world’s largest columnless greenhouse.
Gardens by the Bay which houses this feature is simply a ""MUST SEE"" on you visit to Singapore."
,,Photographers Dream,5.0,,Enter into a mystical world and be lost among the amazing forest. On a hot day it's the best place to escape and enjoy the cool environment amidst the lush vegetation displayed. Wonderful place to photogragh your memories of a visit to Singapore. A great place for the children to explore.
,,mesmerizing!,5.0,,very beautiful and we loved the mist! :-) it was tiring to go up the cloud forest but was worth it!!!
,,Cloud Forest - a true marvel,5.0,,"One walk into this amazing man-made marvel makes you realize how intricately this has been put together, just to give visitors a glimpse of what a rain forest would look like.

Given that this is Singapore, where it tends to remain warm and humid most times, the people who conceived and put together this landmark should be commended.

Spend time here, and you will see some rather rare species of flora that are not even indigenous to this part of the world.

Salut!"
,,Amazing experince to see artificial forest,5.0,,"Though the forest is man made, they have taken utmost care to fee natural. It is been made natural and that is the success of it. Good place for photo shoots."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Totally amazing and well worth the visit would differently go again, specially on hot day as it’s air conditioned and set up is excellent"
,,Garden Junkie,5.0,,The falls at the entrance of the Cloud Forest welcomed the traveler into an environment that surprised and soothed. The gardens within the forest drew the gardeners eve and the colors drew this photographers eye everywhere.
,,Not quite in the clouds but it is misty.,5.0,,"Be prepared for a long wait to get in the elevator to ascend to the top of the mountain (queues are long). However, the wait is worth it. The walk down is via a spiral walkway displaying many interesting plants and the watering system when it comes on provides the impression of mountain mists. A fast hour and a half because of the interest factor."
,,Mini Tropical rain forest dispaly,4.0,,"Very nice rain forest display. A great view of the marina when you climb up the ""mountain"" inside. Must go if you're in Singapore!"
,,Good visit,4.0,,"Part of Gardens of the Bay visit is this visit (if you want to pay). Of two domes this is most visual and least interesting. This dome simulates a mountain environment, that is really difficult because no mountains nearby. Design is great, but some additional explanations will be useful. Good but not great"
,,Stunning walkways.,5.0,,"Although not cheap, (is anything in Singapore?!) this an amazing place.
The waterfalls are incredible, the treetop walkways are awesome and the plants (especially the orchids,) are so beautiful.
Add to that the atmosphere is moist and cool, giving a couple of hours respite from the city heat!"
,,simply amazing.,5.0,,"Pictures cant do justice to this place. Its like roaming over a garden over the hill top. there is mist, a cool environment and a huge variety of flora. amazing imagination i would say."
,,Impressive exhibit,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is a must-see for anyone visiting Singapore. It is like stepping into another world inside. Aim to be there for when the mist is turned on inside to make “clouds”.
,,great waterfall and gardens under a dome,5.0,,"cannt believe they could do all under cove,r the wait to get to the top was organized but it was crowded, l would go early in the day and not on a weekend"
,,WORTH A VISIT,4.0,,I'm not a fan of man made natural attraction. But this one is rather interesting. good place to wander for an hour or so.
,,"Really a ""Cloud Forest""",5.0,,"As the name suggests, a visit to the Cloud Forest (in contrast to the cheery mood in the Flower Dome) brings one to experience journeying into a forest in the clouds. From waterfalls (there is a schedule for the ""misting"") and slightly more dim / dreary feel, it does transport one into what one imagines to be the depths of a forest. The exhibition on conservation towards end was helpful to tie the whole experience together. Less ""glamorous"" than its Flower Dome sister, but no less spectacular."
,,Very picturesque and so cooling,5.0,,"Had a fantastic time visiting with my mum. It was so cooling compared to the temperature outside.

I would suggest varying your itinerary such that the warmest part of the day (11am to about 2pm) is spent in either or both of the domes.

Plenty of pictures of different types and varieties of flora and fauna to be found. They also have seasonal themes at different parts of the year."
,,Forest in a Bubble,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is a wonder of sorts for people who wish to see a forest in the city. Upon entering you will immediately be in sight of the waterfall. Take your pace going through the ramp to appreciate the plants there.
,,Mesmerizing!,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is like a natural rainforest in a dome. It""s gorgeous and really worth it to go here. Great for photo ops and good for kids too."
,,Magical.,5.0,,A breathtaking experience and on a very hot day in Singapore it was a welcomed change of temperature. I would recommend going early in the morning as it gets rather busy. The walk to the top is easy having beautiful views and incredible sculptures as well as spectacular gardens. Highly recommend.
,,Must go if you are in Singapore,5.0,,"These Flower Dorm and Cloud Forest are a must. pls bring your jacket inside it really cold. bring your camera.

Flower dorm they change theme regularly. Pls check what them they are on before you go.

Cloud Forest, it is in door waterfall. you climb around waterfall.

You can get discounted ticket from Orchard road some shops."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is like nothing else in the world. Superbly put together and maintained. It transports you to another place.
,,Forest in the sky,5.0,,"The aircon alone is a much needed respite from the scorching sun. Beautifully constructed, the amazing cloud forest is one of the best attraction. You would have to see it to believe it."
,,Gorgeous place,5.0,,Gorgeous place...... This place is suitable for all ages but it can be crowded especially over the weekend with big tour group.
,,Visit singapore,5.0,,"I enjoyed and happy to look the different shapes,color and variety of the flower..i want to have those flowers in our own house someday.everything is nice.."

,,Amazing Astonishing,5.0,,Well it was extraordinary the amount of flowers were astounding. The waterfall is beautiful and the setting is amazing extraordinary . It is just a fantastic place to see . the best part is it is also air conditioned . On site there are food...More
,,Cold and busy!,3.0,,"I expected a recreation of a tropical rainforest and so was immediately disappointed when we entered an air conditioned cold room with a large concrete mountain. We went on a rainy day and so I was wet and cold on entering the dome, which didn't...More"
,,Buggy friendly and very different,4.0,,If I had a to choose between cloud forest and flower dome I would choose cloud forest. The waterfall is amazing and the greenery is superb. The walk way gives a lovely view of the forest and you can appreciate how complex the forest is....More
,,A great example to follow for many cities and countries,5.0,,"Amazing design. Great idea of the city in a garden...2 hours walking on different levels. Trees, flowers, vegetation. A must if you go to Singapore"
,,A MUST see while in Singapore,5.0,,"It’s amazingly beautiful. The architecture including the waterfall and the plants gives you a feeling of being in a fairytale. A visit there isn’t just about having fun, it also educates visitors about water conservation and climate change."
,,Stunning indoor rainforest (and inexplicably cool!),5.0,,"Walking into this beautiful enclosed rainforest from the draining humidity outside, the cool, revitalising climate is the first in a series of wonderful surprises you get from the Cloud Forest. The waterfall and surrounding flora never cease to enchant and entrance and the microscopic orchids...More"
,,Fantastic! Must-see,5.0,,"The cloud forest is fantastic. Important: go there in the early morning, then there are nearly no tourists! No waiting times, take your pictures wherever you want without any people. It's easy to walk, good paths and very secure. The temperature is just perfect, not too hot, not too cold. The plants are just lovely, the whole dome is really special. If you take your time, you will need approx. 1.5 h. Buy a ticket for both domes (you get a reduction)"
,,Smells like rain,5.0,,Nice to walk around. It’s very green with a real smell of rain place. Enjoyable during hot weather. I think interesting for kids and teenagers.
,,It is amazing,5.0,,"Our group enjoyed our stay in this beautiful designed attraction. There are lots of good photo locations within this attraction. Due to our limited time, we are only able to spend about here. If time permit, I will visit this place again/"

,,Large waterfall,5.0,,The minute you go into the cloud forest you see a large waterfall. You are also surrounded by nature and flowers. It has a variety of flowers all in different array of colors. A must see.
,,"All truly amazing experience,",5.0,,"It is very difficult to explain the experience in Cloud Forest, Words can not explain the beauty of the man made rain forest,"
,,Amazing waterfalls,5.0,,"Absolutely gorgeous display of amazing waterfalls & plants together with beautiful sculptures. The temperature inside is a very comfortable mild (approximately 22deg), so it was easy fur us to wander through the displays for hours."
,,A cloud forrest within the city,4.0,,"Ironically Singapore lies in the equatorial area but still the wanted to immitate the cloud forrest areas they no longer exist in this tiny country. It is an artificial mountain top with immitated weather conditions including mist immited every 2 hours. You can enjoy the walk around the ""mountain"" by taking the elevator to the top and walk downwards. A very nice place to visit"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,An oasis of greenery in Singapores busy metropolis. Worth a visit on a hot day to escape the heat of the sun!
,,very cool water fall,4.0,,It's a little bit cold inside the cloud forest but worth for the visit to see different plants at different area. Do wait for the mist come out to have a different experience.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"The misting, whole energy and greenery take you away from the ""dome"" feeling. Highly recommend paying the extra bucks to get inside."
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,Stunning place to visit. The design & appearance is amazing. Beautiful to walk through & very peaceful & serene.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Never been to a place like this. Very beautiful. Good place for family and couples. Amazing design and everything well maintained.
,,My Favourite,5.0,,"My favourite place to visit in Singapore, very impressive. Don't miss this place, it isn't cheap but worth the money. To get there go via the closest train station, walk along the walk way following the sign to Gardens By The Way. You don't need to walk through the gardens to get to the domes if you don't want to, they have shuttle buses to take you to the Cloud Forest/main section of the gardens. Well worth a visit."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is an amazing place and well worth visiting, thought we would be finished in about an hour but 3 hours later were still walking around as there is so much to see in there and experience.
The 'misting' was superb and you actually forgot you were in a dome and not in the jungle!
Views to the outside world were equally superb.
Do visit!"
,,Recomended Place at Singapore!!,5.0,,"Great Place for Family very nice and we enjoy very much our time spend at The Cloud Forest, nice and cozy , great if not on week end so you can have time to see and relax inside , they had also souvenir shop and restaurant ."
,,Real Experience,5.0,,"This is a great place to go and get close to natures tree's, plants & flowers, lovely & cool, so great chance to get out of the heat of Singapore. You will also learn a lot about global warming"
,,Amazing human attempt to build a forest,4.0,,"Went to Gardens by the bay for the first time after its opened for public. Had seen the place when it was in the making and quite crude.
It's a beautiful forest built with everything tropical under the roof. It's well maintained and has a good feel around it. Must visit destination in Spore."
,,Must see,5.0,,It was like entering in a set of Jurassic movies. It was so dreamy and so beautiful. Worth the money you spend on the tickets.
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,"Must visit Very peaceful Entertaining Place for kids n all ages Loved the waterfall n mist , enjoyed alot"
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,Huge dome with a peaceful atmosphere and lots of interesting plants. You can climb up the interior of the huge waterfall and see the plants from the raised walkways.
,,Average place,3.0,,This is a big-cooled-dome with many plants inside the place. Don’t expect too much and just stroll along the walk and you’ll get happy enough. Took some nice photos but that’s it.
,,One of the two best Singapore attractions,5.0,,"This place, together with the Supertree Grove are reason enough to visit Singapore. They were absolutely incredible."
,,Must visit place,4.0,,"Very innovatively done must visit place in singapore, Nicely constructed feels like real forest Documentaries are worth watching"
,,Beautiful creation,5.0,,"It's spectacular how they've created this place. Lush greenery and a large indoor, man-made waterfall (largest in the world I believe). It's well worth the entrance fee."
,,Cloud Forest at Garden By The Bay,4.0,,"Visited Cloud Forest with my kids over the weekend. It is a great place to visit with the water fall, cold temperature, with flora and fauna around you. Awesome! Kids enjoyed the trip very much."
,,this place is out of this world- it is so beautiful,5.0,,i found this cloud forest even more endearing and enchanting than the flower dome --- because of the rush of oxygen released by the great waterfall cascading down ... all visitors were enthralled by the natural wonder created indoors-
,,Wow,5.0,,Dome two on our visit. How well done is this exhibit! Lift to the top walk down at your own pace. Great rain forest feel.
,,Cool afternoon in tropical city,5.0,,It is a heaven when you enter this air-con garden from the hot sun outside. Wonder around and there are plenty to see in this man-made garden with waterfall.
,,Make sure you go,5.0,,"This is an interesting attraction, the queues are quite moderate, and Cloud Forest provides an interesting insight into Singapore's culture - if you don't have it; make it. This was one of our favourite attractions and neither my daughter nor I are normally into gardens."
,,Hanging Gardens,5.0,,Beautiful man made 35 mtr tall maontain and waterfall . For going to top there is lift . Then we walk through the fog filled cloud walk to bottom . We pass through beautiful flowers and different type of trees and water splashing on us from the waterfall.The experience is beautiful and this is one of best sights to be seen in Singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,You cant go to Singapore without visiting the cloud forest. Stand at the entrance & ask yourself how they built this?. Once you reach the top you will understand why they built this. Simply amazing.
,,COOL PLACE,5.0,,"In a country where it is hot, this is the place for you,
you will forget that you are in a city where everyone is busy,
you can just sit and relax inside and be one with nature!
super worth it. I've been here for like 5 times this year and still I enjoy."
,,An ethereal experience~,5.0,,"Singapore may be a tropical country, but that does not mean you don't get to see and appreciate flowers and plants from a different climate! Cue the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay, one of the biggest greenhouse you'll ever see.

As the name suggests, the Cloud Forest really gives you the feel like you're walking in a forest among the clouds, with the cool mist and temperature and one of the tallest indoor waterfalls. Take the lift to the highest floor and make your way down floor by floor through a walkway as you discover plants and vegetations of varying types and species."
,,Such a lovely experience,5.0,,One of the must go places. Had a lovely experience walking through the cloud forest. Must go. I believe people in wheelchairs can also go as the place is wheelchair friendly.
,,Beautiful and cooling place,4.0,,"Very well arranged and nice place with many different plants and flowers. Although the waterfall is man made, the place need high maintenance and love to do it."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Was amazing seeing the waterfall, climbing to the top of the mountain and then making our way down, look out for all the dragons hidden in the gardens."
,,Beautiful oasis,4.0,,"Was there several times, it is like a green escape in the modern city. On weekends very crowded so do not expect a quite zone. But definetly worth to visit also with children. You can walk from the MRT. No need to pay extra park shuttle if you only want to see this place."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing place , displays are fantastic, takes a little time to get to the top but well worth it when you get there & start walking back down, would defintely go back again"
,,Out of the world experience.,5.0,,"They have recreated an entire forest system from tropical at the bottom to alpine at the top within a fully enclosed glass domed structure with air conditioning.
The variety of plant and flowers is breathtaking. You should actually take out half a day for this one location and then proceed to the Marina Gardens by the bay in the evening for the night sound and music show."
,,Beautiful and Educational,4.0,,"As a biology teacher, I wish I could take my students on a field trip here from NYC. Despite all the people around, it feels like a natural waterfall and I love that it gets colder as you climb. Very beautiful gardens inside and on the “mountain.” The line to go up moved very quickly. I loved the educational aspects as well and efforts at conservation. It is so important to protect our planet, and I am happy the cloud forest takes this seriously."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"The variety of gardens, plants and flower here is unbelievable. All located inside a humidity controlled environment with themed nursery rhyme gardens to further add interest."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"This dome, flower dome and gardens by the bay for the light show definitely worth a visit. Crowded at the weekends."
,,Lovely Greens!,5.0,,The hanging falls are lovely! Such an amazing indoor creation. Everything green! It eases your mind after a looong week of work. I could not recommend enough.
,,Can’t miss this.,5.0,,This is a most unusual thing I have ever seen. In middle of the city it transforms u to a rainforest. Amazing greenery and water combo. The walk is worth at least once.
,,Almost spiritual,5.0,,The most amazing waterfall iv ever seen inside a man made structure ! So pretty and at dusk is even more serene. Ramps everywhere so its wheelchair friendly
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"Wonderful visit! It is a bit pricey maybe but worth! You don4t anything like this anywhere but HERE! You need q whole day to explore all the park, inside and outside. a lot of different things to appreciate!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,This is a great experience. Enjoy the multi-level platform with different plants at each level. I particularly interested in succulents and found the top level to be the best display of plants I have ever seen. Take your time and enjoy the variety.
,,An Equatorial rain forest under a glass dome.,5.0,,The Cloud forest is definately a must when you go to the Gardens by the Bay. The whole experience was breathtaking and awesome. The variety of plants was simply out of this world. We visited late afternoon which was nice as it just happened to be very slightly cooler. I wish we could have told so many visitors that the experience of looking closely at the flowers and taking note of the wonderful variety is so much more fun than posing around for photos and obstructing other people's views of the flowers.
,,Spectacular!,4.0,,If you like plants this is the place to go. Every type and color imaginable. Queuing for the lift when busy can be frustrating but at least the dome is cool! Very well done and worth a visit when next in Singapore.
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,"This is my third visit with three different people and they as I, were amazed. For me it has been great to see the new exhibitions each visit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Visited this venue with free tickets from the Singapore Garden Festival. Glad we visited. It was beautiful! A lovely cool spot for a wander. It had cultural sections such as South African and Australian. Beautiful orchids. I had 2x 9 yo who very much enjoyed also. Loved taking pictures of all the plants. Some lovely displays. Will return with the in-laws.
,,Can not belive it,5.0,,This is a must see place better at dusk or night amazing place must see and very safe what a perfect place to see and spend time in.
,,Breathtaking experience!,5.0,,"Your breath will be taken away from the moment you enter the Cloud Forest, as you are enveloped into the cool interior and facing the beautiful indoor waterfall. Recommend to visit during the afternoon to escape the midday heat, and take a water bottle with you. You can easily spend an hour or more here. There’s a small walkway high up in the structure which can get a bit acrophobic if you’re so inclined, but it’s a lovely view from up there!

When buying tickets there’s an option to buy a 2 in 1 ticket for this as well as the flower dome. It’s a bit cheaper and can be utilized on 2 separate days within a week of purchase. We visited the cloud forest on a weekday and the flower dome on Sunday and boy the difference a weekend makes! The place was absolutely PACKED on Sunday! So I would definitely suggest going on a weekday to avoid the crowds."
,,Insufficient Directional Signage,3.0,,"Visited Cloud Forest on 11 August 2018, find that the directional signage to find our way around is not sufficient.

When we were at Level 6 making our way down, as we follow the trail till the lobby, signage was not clear to inform visitor to use the escalator to descend to the next level to continue the walk.

In fact all lobby area signages has to be more precise and give clear directional indication."
,,Breathtaking! Do not miss this!,5.0,,"Allow half a day at least but better a full day here. Dress light and take an umbrella and a bottle of water as Singapore is hot and wet at times. Pack some light snacks in your backpack also as there is only one restaurant and it is a little restricted for choice. There is quite a bit of walking at this attraction, but it is a must see! Do not miss it! It can be quite crowded with other tourists, but this will not slow your progress very much. Make sure to see the other gardens while there.
We finished our day with a meal at satay street at the base of the dome, a fantastic meal! then lingered for the super tree light show well into the night. Use the taxis to get back to your hotel, they are very cheap, clean and super professional. A relaxing day out in a busy city."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Great place, tropical rainforest feel, but cool temperatures. The walkways go all the way to the top and the flowers and plants are beautiful. There are lifts to each level if needed. The waterfall is spectacular. The film towards the end is worth watching and thought provoking. Well worth visiting for a couple of hours."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Walk through a man made rainforest with every imaginable tropical plant. Sky bridges and nature walks are very easy little or no fitness levels needed
,,Heaven on Earth Experience,5.0,,I don't know of any other place where you can experience such a variety of plants accumulated so beautifully than this place. Very well maintained and managed. Singapore offers something unique and brilliant.
,,Must visit,5.0,,Its really beautiful and as soon as you enter the water fall and the cool breeze just makes it special.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"While visiting Singapore recently, one evening we went Cloud Forest while down in the Marina Bay Area. Well worth the visit. We used the MRT system to get there from Ochard Road which was pretty straight forward. We were there early evening as we wanted...More"
,,Cloud forest and flower dome,5.0,,"Great, well worth a visit. Well priced. We really enjoyed the scenery. We were exhausted after wandering for hours."
,,Very creative.,5.0,,It is worth a visit in this entire surrounding. Well designed to accomodate nature in an adorable pattern. It is though a short visit but the presentation is excellent
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,Take a jumper - it's freezing inside. Absolutely worth it. Amazing greenery and very serene. Amazing how all these plants survive and live - and yet no bugs?
,,Wonderful attraction,5.0,,One of the nicest attraction around. Quite magnificent looking. Especially when you climb up to the top of the forest. Great view.
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,It was so breathtaking. The waterfall itself was amazing and when you go into the cavern and other places it’s just so beautiful
,,Loved it,5.0,,This was quite amazing dome. Wasn’t over busy. Waterfall was just prefect Reasonable entry price. A lot to see
,,Lovely,5.0,,I loved the design and arrangement of the place. The architectural design is unique and the utilization of space is just fabulous
,,A mountain inside a dome.,5.0,,"Have you ever seen a mini glass dome with cities or snowy villages inside? Well this is a life sized one, with a man made mountain inside it. Thats what you feel like when you are in there. Singapore usually has a rather balmy weather...More"
,,If you have limited mobility or small children otherwise find an outdoor walk,2.0,,This was very artificial feeling though it did offer respite from the heat during the day. I much preferred some of the walks I found in the water catchment areas such as MacRitchie Resevoir
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is in gardens by the bay and is definitely worth going into! It’s such a magical place and it’s so beautiful!!!
,,Amazing space in a busy city.,5.0,,Very much worth a trip - great place to spend a few hours. Also a great place to cool of from the heat.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Do yourself a favour and stroll leisurely through this amazing forest of lush greenery. It is a must if you love carnivorous plants :)
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,I spent far longer in this beautiful forest than I expected to. The flowers and orchids were amazing and the artworks are well placed and imaginative. A truly enjoyable experience. I started taking photos and just didn't stop - so much to see and the aspect of looking out at the other highlights of Singapore such as the Flyer and Marina Bay Sands from inside the dome was also a different perspective. Thoroughly recommended.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Spent an amazing couple of hours here, it’s a must see if you go to the Gardens, and not too expensive either."
,,Quite ok to go once in a while,3.0,,If u go to gardens by the bay n its hot n humid. Y not go to cloud forest to cool down. U get to see some flowers and theres galleries at the main area. you might be asked if u want to take the stairs to level 7 when theres a long queue for the lift. This place is very crowded if theres event going on. Lesser crowd than flower dome So bring your own water n snacks. Drinks are costly and macdonald has a long queue.
,,Lovely Experience,5.0,,"The opera music was lovely, the view was outstanding from the walkway, the lighting was enchanting. The experience qwould have been better if the staff manning the elevators was more efficient. That would have enabled us to be on the walkway when the music started."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest in Gardens by the Bay offers and amazing experience. The landscape with vertical gardens is stunning. The cool atmosphere with unique structure and efficient use of energy is excellent. When you look down the landscape, different shades of green will fill you with a sense of wonder and serenity. On a visit to Singapore, the conservatories are an attraction that one must not miss."
,,Beautifully done,5.0,,"An interesting and well laid out activity, with lots to see as you meander around the waterfall, both up and down. Similar to most activities in Singapore it can become quite busy. Take your time and slow the pace. It is well worth it."
,,Most go,5.0,,"This place was fantastic. Ok it’s man made etc but the presentation, the sculptures and the whole experience was sensational"
,,Absolutely fantastic,5.0,,Spent ages in here. Absolutely fantastic. So well set up and easy to get around. So worth the visit.
,,Out of this world.,5.0,,"The cloud forest was amazing, photos do not do it justice. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience. If you are tossing up between the Flower Dome and the Cloud forest definitely choose the cloud Forest they don’t even come close in comparison"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,The scale and detail of the Cloud Forest is amazing. Well worth the time and cost. Good photo opportunities too.
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"It certainly is a must place see so make your way there if you are in Singapore. Although beautiful, it is not natural so looks too manufactured. We still enjoyed it though."
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"This is the second dome in Garden by the Bay where one goes up to the 7th floor and walk down to the ground level and see many plants and trees, including a man-made waterfall. Air-conditioned. With display of crystals."
,,Nice but overpriced,3.0,,"I bought the ticket because they had orchid exhibition so I also visited the cloud forest. It is nice and very well done but I guess the ticket is to expensive to see those plants, trees but this is my opinion only. I rather visit orchid garden then this cloud forest.
It is nice but try to find discount ticket ;) See pictures, so you can decide."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"You must see this amazing place, the plants and the whole environment are unlike anything that can be seen elsewhere. Don’t miss."
,,A Cold Rain Forest,5.0,,"The giant waterfall welcome us as soon as we stepped into the entrance. Many crowd around the man made waterfall for photo. To visit the dome, we took the lift up to the higher level and walk downwards. Each level has it own distinct view. At the lower floor, there is a theatre that shows an educational film on climate changes and the environment. It is good to sit through the show."
,,Wear a jacket & bring a camera!,5.0,,"The climate control here is pretty cool (as in a bit nippy) & it'll take the you the better part of an hour just to have a look around & that's without stopping too much.

Make sure you find your way to the top of the waterfall & gaze at the sheer size of the steel structure you're in. It's quite the site!

Also don't forget to check out the calcified formations (stalagmites/stalactites) & natural gems in the gallery they're quite interesting especially with the mirrors hanging from the ceiling.

I went here with my wife on our honeymoon in April 2017 & we had a blast!

Don't forget to check out the flower garden next door to the Cloud Forest"
,,So much in a tiny place,5.0,,We spent timeat the garden show and got a combo ticket for this attraction as well. Really worth while! We learnt so much about this special type of forrest...
,,Serene experience,5.0,,A very well maintained dome. Lovely waterfall with so much of flora all around that it overwhelms you. A great photo shoot opportunity with lots of well located spaces. The walk down the pathway from the top was very exciting.
,,Amazing and quite an eye opener,4.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit although I was initially cautious of foliage overload, the self sustainability of not just the domes but the complete gardens by the bay is amazing. As with any attraction there will be parts that capture you and some that won't but it was interesting from a technical stance, the plants, the environment and of course the sheer scale of the dome."
,,Fantasy,5.0,,Excellent time spent. You go up in a lift then walk at your own pace down around the huge structure. Went with my 86 year old Mum and she was fine.
,,Flower paradise!,5.0,,Fantastic variety of beautiful plants. Great presentation and arrangement of plants from all over the world. Beautiful orchids. Just amazing!
,,A must for anyone in Singapore,5.0,,"The cloud forest is nothing short of breathtaking, great fun for families. You have never been to anything like it and probably won’t unless you visit Singapore. Cloud forest is breathtaking."
,,Awesome attraction,5.0,,"Compared to Flower Doom, i liked Cloud forest a lot more. Due to the clouds simulation, Rain forest plants and the walk ways at great heights, this is a must visit attraction for sure."
,,A beautiful place,5.0,,Cloud forest is a must go especially if you are visiting Singapore for the first time. The seven floor high waterfalls and the flora is well maintained.
,,One of must visit place in SIngapore,4.0,,"Cloud forest is part of Gardens by the Bay area, One of must visit place in Singapore. You will be surprise with this engineering marvel for nature. Take your food before entering as food and drinks consumption is not allowed. For infants,there can be exception."
,,Not for tourists from tropics,3.0,,"Yes, its a construction wonder how they have successfully re-created the cloud forest in such a place. There is lot to watch for a person who has no experience with cloud forests and waterfalls and it will definitely be a WOW experience.

But for me, who hails from a beautiful tropical island nation, there was very few things to experience. However, there were great educational shorts films to watch and to learn.

Its a great vertical garden experience, anyway."
,,cool green dome in hot hot sg,5.0,,excellent man made dome with forest experience. Need to walk around to enjoy thou u have a lift available.
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"If you are first-timer, it’s definitely worth a visit. Many floras and landscape is kept well too. Ideal for everybody."
,,Stunning concept,5.0,,"Just loved this Cloud Forrest. It is just brilliant and a do not miss. Was full of beautiful forest green growth, and climbing up into the cloud was fascinating. The waterfall on the outside created a mysterious sensation on the inside as you climbed."
,,Enjoying National Day,4.0,,"Clpud forest is definite a nice place to relax and take a walk. Although ypu had to purchase a ticket to go in, but it is a sure must visit. With Singapore a tropical country, the cloud forest provide a feeling of being in a cooling country with a nice view of waterfall at the start of the trip to cloud forest. As you walk along, you can definitely still feel the cool breeze and it feels like you are walking in a forest but with pretty flowers and nice cold feeling."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Every little detail has been attended to, and I'm sure one could visit many times and see something new every time. The optional aerial walkway is not for the faint of heart, but there are spectacular views inside the dome and of the city outside."
,,Impressive construction but unnecessary,3.0,,"I enjoyed my visit to the cloud forest, however, it is pure human construction and even though it is nice to see, it still feels ""fake""."
,,Not worth it,2.0,,We came last June. This attraction is not worth your penny. I didnt even see clouds or fog whatever 😂 and so many tourist they didnt even manage the queue. There’s nothing special in this attraction. Flower dome is more okay.
,,Gardens by the bay domes,4.0,,Walked our way around and around this internal waterfall to reach the top. Beautiful Flora and great atmosphere. Recommend this as a top Singapore tourist attraction.
,,Incredible,5.0,,Amazing feature. An incredible selection of plants on display. So very well maintained and just a joy to see.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Really beautiful place, walking around behind the waterfall is lovely. Lots of imaginative selfie opportunities on the walkways :)"
,,Wonderful creation in the heart of the city,4.0,,It's a must visit place when you visit gardens by the bay Marina Bay Sands attractions. Visit cloud forest as well as flower dome in the day time rather in the night for a better experience.
,,You won't be lonely wandering on this cloud,5.0,,"It's an extraordinary feat of engineering. It's a magnificent man-made simulation of an ecosystem featuring around 4,000 square meters of vegetation. But when you take the lift 35m to the top, and walk down the facts and figures are transcended by the beauty of this living sculpture. Whatever else you do in Singapore, don't miss this. It's unique and outstanding."
,,Absolutely fantastic,5.0,,Manmade forest with a spectacular array of plants and trees where the plants are fed with carbon dioxide.
,,Another must see,5.0,,"An amazing place, they really take the green conservation theme seriously in Singapore. Just like the gardens this is a unique singapore thing. The whole place is airconditioned so a good place to cool down. Worth a see"
,,Cloud Forest -,3.0,,"Cloud forest is nice and great place. It has a ticket of $33. But, if you have to choose, I will recommend Singapore Botanic Gardens ($5), instead of cloud forest."
,,Another Singapore Must See,5.0,,It was amazing walking 40m above the ground and seeing the wonderful display of plants and trees. The walk ways are breath-taking.
,,wonder under the roof.........,5.0,,"its a fantastic to visit ...wish to go there again and amazingly mentended , greenry and staff was good to check ..."
,,OMG,5.0,,"Another OMG moment whilst visiting Singapore. I have never seen anything like this.. Absolutely stunning.. Even better that on the day we went it was extremely hot so it was nice to walk in and cool right down!
So easy to get around and see every part of this beautiful place. We were lucky enough to be there at midday when they were misting the gardens. So pretty. Do yourself a favour and go and check this out."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A must see, an indoor waterfall, an indoor mountain that you walk around on an elevated walkway with the most amazing flowers everywhere"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a must for anyone visiting Singapore. To truly experience the Size and Mass of this forest you need to take the skywalk.
,,Nice & cool dome,5.0,,Crossing off my list. It is a beautiful place. I recommend you bring a shawl in case it gets a little chill especially at night. I think I caught a cold wearing a light dress. We were there around 7:45pm
,,Favourite place to visit!,5.0,,We visited every part of the gardens by the bay and the cloud forest dome was our favourite. The place is breathtakingly beautiful. Must see while in Singapore !
,,There’s a reason this is Number 1,5.0,,Just amazing! Beautifully decorated and kept. Great views from the bridges. Also a great message about the environment and sustainability afterwards. Definitely my number 1 from Singapore. If you had to chose only 1 dome this is the one to chose.
,,Far too artificial,3.0,,"Not ugly but far too artificial and overcrowded (and expensive) to be a must-do in Singapore. The visit ends with moralizing movies, a bit paradoxical in this city of excesses."
,,Great Experience.,4.0,,It's quite amazing how they have constructed this popular attraction with its indoor waterfall and suspended walkways through all the rainforest plants. Well worth a visit.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Worth the money and a very nice experience. Beautiful flowers and views. Nice view at the top. Go there.
,,Really Cool,5.0,,"The cloud forest was really cool. It has a waterfall, and a few different levels that you can up and see and walk around. You can see the cloud inside and walk through it. And beautiful plants."
,,A beautiful way to enjoy nature,5.0,,"The variety of plants and flowers here are amazing!! Upon entering, the stunning waterfall is a breath-taking sight. There are specific misting times which helps make your photos even more beautiful. The quartz is also really amazing to see.
Try to avoid holidays as there will be less people."
,,Time your visit with the Misting,5.0,,"This is an amazing garden and worth the ticket price.
Our small kids loved their time here and I would recommend visiting during the week to avoid crowds.
It is lovely and cool here and the plants are beautiful. I wish our city had something similar."
,,Really fun botany extravaganza,5.0,,I loved the variety of everything here. We went on a very hot day and inside it was wonderfully cool. The range of species is astonishing. Fun to just wonder around for a few hours to cool off.
,,Most wonderful garden ever,5.0,,‘‘Tis garden is 350 acres so impossible to see all in a day but try! It is truly marvelous with statues among the flowers which add a special delight. Makes you want to copy if possible.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Awesome building with such a great display. Can get a little crowded, but the display is what you are there for"
,,artificial rainforest,4.0,,this section of the gardens by the bay prides itself of the flora and artificial waterfall that makes one wonder how on earth were they able to simulate such a wonder that can only be found in the deepest part of any asian rainforests? you’ll be amazed and in awe with the details this cloud forest possesses. you’ll never feel that you’re just inside a dome.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"This is definitely my favorite attraction, one of the most amazing place. You shouldn’t miss this, A MUST TRY!!!"
,,Every minute inside is worth full,5.0,,"Woooooooooow what a marvel, on earth the man made waterfall inside the dome is a feast to eyes, with so many tourists to join it becomes an experience itself"

,,Some where out in paradise.,5.0,,So lovely to see all the beautiful orchids and other flora. It’s like you are in a different world. Very well cared for and just how it’s all just arranged is wonderfull. We enjoyed it very much.
,,"Awesome waterfall, and that’s it though",5.0,,"The waterfall was awesome! Try to go early and take photos at the waterfall by the entrance. The rest of the forest was okay, it’s just trees after all. Very educational though and cool for a quick stroll."
,,Most impressive part of th egardens by the bay,5.0,,"Vast and tall “greenhouse “ impressively planted with all manor of tropical and subtropical plants, giant waterfall and a mountain in the centre. Further interesting educational presentations at the end make this an educational as well as fascinating and beautiful exhibit."
,,Refresh your soul,5.0,,These two massive glass houses contain completely different - but equally beautiful gardens. Hidden amongst the greenery are exquisitely carved gardens which kids love to run round and spot. Long queues for the suspended walkway add another interesting feature. Great photo opportunities
,,A must to see when visiting Singapore!,4.0,,Loved going near the tall indoor waterfalls. The forest was just magical. Enjoyed the views of Marina Bay from the skywalk. One of the best things we did during our stay to Singapore.
,,Interesting!,5.0,,Went with my 12 year old son. We really enjoyed our visit and were quite glad it was cooler than outside!
,,Gorgeous!,5.0,,"We loved the Cloud Forest because it was so many plants, vines, trees mixed in with the True rainforest feel. Very fun walks by higher and higher experiencing the beauty of all of the plants and water features. Air conditioning + 👍"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"Beautiful artificial waterfall, the best green house i've ever visited. A can spend the entire day here in the AC"
,,MUST VISIT,5.0,,Highly recommended place to visit. We travelled with young kids and had a great time. Just remember that its COLD and carry a jacket. Its quite informational so spend time in reading all the things indicated at various levels and plan 2-3 hours.
,,WOW!!!!,5.0,,A MUST see when visiting Singapore's Gardens by the Bay. Modest fee but well worth the experience. The Cloud Forest is a walk into the clouds with the eco system at your fingertips. BEAUTIFUL!!!
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Overwhelmingly lush. Beyond beautiful.
Ought to be the best dome of the Gardens.

Super still and stable sky walkways, nothing to worry about and no hassle.

Wasn't so packed even on a Sunday. Whole trip here has a seamless flow, did not feel the crowds at all."
,,The most intersting part of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"There is a charge for this facility, but the air conditioning makes it worth it. It is definitely unique, and a good place to go for most people."
,,Up in the Cloud,5.0,,"Amazing structure, waterfall was spectacular, views were magnificent. The vertical plantings had me awestruck. It was easy to walk around the elevated platform and the lower level of the Secret Garden was very mystifying. The temperature inside the Cloud Dome was very pleasant."
,,First timers,5.0,,"I so loved it .. Creative , Awesome and Fantastic !! We had lot of fun .. indoor and air conditioned .. Never heard any complaints from my kids .. I really enjoyed the view and had my 10k steps .."
,,Peaceful Experience,5.0,,The cloud forest was like nothing I had ever seen before. You start on ground level and slowly walk your way up tp the top with the views getting better. At the end of the cloud dome there is an area that shows how we as humans are ruining our planet.... The displays they had really hit home and make the experience even better to broaden our mind to whats truly going on in the world.
,,Mystical with a mist,4.0,,Definitely worth being here during the mist schedule. Check the mist schedule and enter exactly 5-10 mins before it to enjoy the true beauty. The mist only lasts for 10-15 mins so take it in as the next one you have wait for quite some time. If you have just missed the timings go to the flower dome to kill your time and then right before the misting go to the flower dome exit and take a re-entry stamp if you haven't finished flower dome and go to the misting section. With the stamp you can re enter the flower dome later once you have finished the cloud forest
,,Amazing,5.0,,This garden is just spectacular the design and walkways are not to be missed on a trip to Singapore. One thing I did note on the way out they pretend to be greenies with a display on global warming etc. However they have around a dozen stalagmites that I think we're real and they are totally built on reclaimed land.....go figure. Well worth seeing though
,,Excellent place.. must visit..,5.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.19 )
I didn't select whether our family go Botanic Garden or Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, and I ask my friend who live Singapore where we go. My friend didn't hesitate to recommend this area. The Cloud forest was architecture and plants, I think. The cool air, beautiful plants and good walk course was very good to us. Must visit if you in Marina area."
,,Cloud Forest Singapore Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,Nice and cool with a man-made waterfall. Lot of forage and plants. A good trail to walk in the early evening.
,,Pleasant escape from the heat,5.0,,If you enjoy plants and flowers this is a place worth visiting. Book your tickets online to avoid the queue and possibly save some money. Also remember to enjoy the view of these buildings from the outside. Tip : lots of free gardens to enjoy around the building if you are on a tight budget.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"As per the previous one, I'll say it again because one Dome leads to the other

Waaaaaa! This place was amazing. With beauty and ancient trees everywhere it's so much to take in. The visual beauty and the smell of the flowers and the water fall and the little hidden figures like the Cheshire"
,,BEAUTY,5.0,,"If you love anything to do with landscapes, flowers, waterfalls, this is the place to be. I could've stayed in here for hours. There is not an inch of this place that is not covered in green or color. Not to mention, slightly nerve wracking but so totally worth it to walk the seemingly never ending upward bridge that goes around the dome. I would do this a thousand times over."
,,Totally amazing,5.0,,Another spot you have to visit when you head to Singapore. And it is nice and cool!!! Just the most amazing place
,,More than I thought!,5.0,,"I thought I was just going to see a waterfall. The waterfall is fantastic, but continue on for more! It was interesting and we stayed longer that we thought we would, probably just over an hour."
,,Wow...just wow!,5.0,,"Of all the areas of Gardens by the Bay this was the coolest. Literally and figuratively. Amazing building with great views and plenty of photo ops. Waterfalls, flowers, plants, crystals, viewpoints. Incredible. See this!"
,,Lovely way to spend an afternoon,5.0,,Easy to find and no queue at the ticket office. Was lovely to walk around and there is a lot more to see than I initially thought. I thought walking to the top of the forest was the only thing to see but there was a secret garden and crystal room too
,,A Naturally cool place,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is a beautiful architectural display in the midst of the Gardens. Forest theme, waterfall and the whole experience is blended together. The place literally gives you the feeling as if you're in the middle of a forest and enjoying a cool sight. The dome and the surrounding areas have quite walking but the trail is not so difficult and it's a good walk. All in all it's a good place to be at and a good experience away from the city chaos."
,,Forest in the middle of the City - cool - literally and figuratively.,5.0,,"Very Cool Concept and expertly executed.
Worth visting for an afternoon, but avoid the weekends when there are crowds.
Cloud Forest is a domed environment, where there is a central pillar representing the tree.
When you enter the dome you see the central pillar rising up. Inside the pillar, there are various exhibits and walkways, so you are directed to the top of the piller (about 7 stories) and you walk your way down the pillar and enjoy the excellent views, forest flora and waterfalls.
The environment is air conditioned and cool, but the walk is pretty long and there are not many places to sit (if any)
Also there are no refreshments or shops (until the very end) so you will be spending 1-2 hours on a hike, although it is a very easy hike with lots to see along the way, including some walkways that jut out from the central pillar.

There are lifts to the top, but there may be a queue, if you have no problems climbing stairs, you can climb the 7 stories to the top.
Bring a camera and breathe in the fresh air!
Absolutely worth a visit if you have never been, but probably not one to vist again once you have visited it once."
,,Beautiful spot,5.0,,"Really cool spot to check out. After a day of walking around Singapore in June, this was a much welcome respite. They do an excellent job having the paths guide you to see all sorts of interesting spots, the highlight of course being the huge waterfall. There are also a bunch of areas to read about what the plants are, some history and environmental info and learn about conservation."
,,Group,5.0,,On a tour but this is a must see. Very well presented and set out for a walk through. Lift to the top and walkway as well as escalator down.
,,Must see!,5.0,,Waterfalls. Nice flowers! Must see! A bit crowded on sunday but still spacy. This is a must see place in Singapore!
,,Great place to visit!,5.0,,Really a fun and interesting place to visit. Very educational and everyone will come out having learned one new thing.
,,Must Visit When Visiting Singapore,5.0,,"We visited the first day in Singapore - and never regretted it. This is a must-see attraction that takes you into one of the prettiest parks/gardens in Singapore. The park if free for visitors and residents to roam, but there is a fee to go into the domes which include the Cloud Forest - terrific arboretum with tropical plants and huge waterfall. Definitely worth the admittance fee."
,,Just Beautiful,5.0,,"Absolutely enjoyed spending time in the cloud Forest, well worth paying the entry fee, so well put together and an opportunity to get some beautiful photos."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Must visit this coservatory when at Gardens By The Bay. Spend an hour or so here, the place is nicely done up."
,,Unusual,5.0,,"Unusual thing to find in the middle of a busy metropolitan city. This was an expensive admission, but you gotta see it If you’re in Singapore. I was surprised to find out that it was air conditioned! Very happy with my visit."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place, offering a break from the heat. The waterfall is lovely. A great place to visit."
,,Transit in Singapore,5.0,,"SIDD IN SINGAPORE

What it takes to have a 24 hours stop in a city where you’ve never been to?
There are no direct flights from Denpasar Airport to reach Lucknow India and the only option is to transit via Singapore. While waiting for boarding an airline ground staff announced the delay of estimated departure due to late turn around of the same aircraft to be used. It was honestly the worst thing ever he heard that day thinking the short time to spend in the city known for Tagline “Passion Made Possible” .After kicking one’s heels, he finally arrived at Changi Airport (2 hrs and 40 min flight duration) with mixed tickled pink and cold feet at the same time. The Immigration officer asked how many days he intends to stay as Visa allows a maximum period of 30 days with a validity of 2 years, 24 hours maybe sounds good to welcomed him with a smile. In the arrival area there’s a Helpdesk Center to provide details you might need like a map or tourist book and in his case watching some vlogs about this place gave him an idea where to go and that’s to explore “Little India”. He installed “Grab” app instead of taking a cab from the taxi stand surely cost more than bus or trains yet cheaper compare to Taxi’s roaming around. If staying longer then MRT could definitely the best choice of transport considering the fastest and efficient way to get you to most parts of Singapore. He booked Sandpiper Hotel (3 star property), location wise is convenient to markets or shopping centers, local Indian restaurants, Mrt stations, and walkable distance to Little India. Rooms are relatively small yet fair enough for 1 night lodge mostly if travelling alone and if not carrying too much luggage to fit in the space. Wifi is also available, front desk were nice and helpful, still recommendable if not so picky. Dinner was served in Bismillah Biryani Restaurant nearby the hotel. Around 7 pm when the driver came to bring him to Night Safari (he paid 15 SGD for the driver + 47 SGD for the entrance ticket). The timing was perfect as soon as he entered the zoo a live show was ongoing treating everyone with an amazing experience and great fun. The park lightings significantly catch the eye of the visitors to enjoy nocturnal behavior of different animals in the forest which is normally open till 12:30 midnight.

Morning of the next day he decided to have his breakfast in “little India Restaurant” just few steps away from the hotel and get prepared for the half day tour to take him to Marina Bay to see Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Grab app made his life much easier in a click of his finger driver was there, that’s pretty comfortable, isn’t it? Entrance cost SGD 28 (for both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome). A magnificent and worthy to visit with its well-maintained nature of greeneries and impeccable architecture of the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. This refreshing mist of waterfall in Cloud Forest that welcomes the tourist gives an instant impression to take you through levels of opportunity to see various tropical kind of plants. And yes, not all comes for free cause if wish to do skywalk or have access to glass domes there would have to pay an additional cost. You don’t need to be a huge flower sucker to deeply get impressed and appreciates the Flower Dome, just get your feet there lay your eyes enjoy the heavenly scent and let it judge on its own. It could’ve been better if not departing in 3 hours unfortunately the driver was already waiting outside to drop him to the Airport. It’s not always about how long you stayed in one place, but how it indulged your spirit and the feeling of being at home is more enough to fall in love with the city

,,The best part of Gardens by the Bay By A Mile.,5.0,,"A must see if visiting Singapore.Well Presented ,An Excellent Walk And Surprisingly Informative.This made the day out worthy."
,,Well worth the money,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was great, I had originally planned for 1 day in the MANILA Bay area, with Cloud Forest and other attractions, but ended up calling back that night.

Great place for a walk, see plants, get ideas for the garden. Would recommend a visit.

Tip: Try and visit early in the day. Then when leaving get your hand stamped so that you can re-enter later in the night if you wanted to look round again later."

,,Engineered Oasis in the middle of a concrete jungle,5.0,,This was a lovely surprise in that it brings together the botanical uniqueness from different and diverse areas into one place. What lets it down is the number of people who visit as the sheer number of people detracts from what might otherwise be a serene ethereal experience.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,what can on say. worth every cent of the $22 entry fee. Easy walking for me who has a back injury. Nice an cool inside.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Where else in the world can you see an enormous garden and waterfall completely constructed indoors. A glass dome. And you get to walk in the clouds. Buy the two garden pass which includes the indoor flower garden.
,,Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim - Tourists Should Visit. Just Like the Movie Avatar,5.0,,"Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim. Tourists Should Visit when in Singapore. The place is Just Like the Movie Avatar. I like the ambience. However, I did not enjoy walking on the skywalk. I have vertigo. My children and wife loved it. They were amused by my illogical concern of heights. Bring a bottle of water. There is a water cooler that you can fill up your bottle. Air-conditioned. Generally a very nice walk. At the top, you can take a selfie with the Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer as background. Regards Dr H C Matthew Sim"
,,Another world,5.0,,Certainly check this out if you are out at gardens by the bay. Like a fantasy. You need more than one hour to explore. Also stay for night light show at the garden.
,,The world's tallest indoor waterfall,5.0,,"Experience a sudden drop in temperature and a spectacular view. The world's tallest indoor waterfall is a stunning view. Suggest visiting this at Sunset, at the Lost Land and catch a beautiful view of the city."
,,heavenly,5.0,,never go on public holiday! it was too crowded when we visited there. So we had to queue for quite some time & it was quite hard to enjoy & actually feel being in the beautiful forest like garden .
,,Unique,5.0,,Loved this - we did both the flower one and this one and would recommend the Cloud forest over the flower. Both were awesome but because it’s so crowded I would only do one if I went back.
,,One of two conservatories in Singapore that exemplifying elements of edutainment and innovation.,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is one of the two most visited conservatories in Gardens by the Bay. This all climate controlled glasshouse is an ideal place for all ages whether it is for educational purpose or for leisure entertainment. You can take your time stroll around different area of the replicated forest, browse through some of the world most precious rare plants and spend more time for whatever interesting you the most. This indoor tropical forest structure is an innovative genius, designed to be environmental friendly by connecting the vent-cool system at nearby Supertree Grove where rain water is collected and then recycled to work as venting-cooling-watering functions for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It is an outstanding engineer work runs on sustainable energy to minimize the environmental footprints.

While Flower Dome replicates Mediterranean’s mild cool environment and semi-arid dry climate, provides idea environment to nurture many rare and exotic plants originally from five different continents; on the other hand Cloud Forest represents region’s cool moist mountain climates. Visitors are awe by the skyscraper high of man-made water falls and cool mists rushing down intermittently from top of the Cloud Mountain to keep the place similar to the tropical climates. The man-made Cloud Mountain is the centerpiece of the Cloud Forest where ferns, moss and tropical plants grow on top of other plants; cover the entire surface of the hollowed mountain structure. Visitors can take the elevator to the top of mountain-the Lost World- where you find many small and large intriguing Nepenthes, the insect eating pitcher plants and Venus-fly catchers. On your way down you get the close encounter with the waterfalls from inside walkway of the mountain structure. The Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk provide panorama and close-up views of epiphytes plants and many tropical vegetations growing around the Cloud Mountain. As you loop your ways down from Cloud Walk you will reach the Crystal Mountain where you find exhibits of stalactites, stalagmites and important elements of geological makeup. The Treetop Walk extended from the mountain structure gives visitors closer looks at the makeup of the glass structure and Marina Bay views. Down to the ground level you will find your way to the enchanting Secret Garden, a newly added theme garden replicates tropical cool moist environment of limestone forests and caves. It showcases thousands of moist loving vegetations, rare tiny orchids, small misty falls, and wooden carvings of planet’s creatures on the tree trunks to entertain the viewers. It is one of the top three themed locations (Orchid Garden, Lost World and Secret Garden) I rated in Cloud Forest that is worthy of your time. Inside of the Cloud Forest also showcases region’s exotic flowers and varieties of beautiful orchid blossoms -the Singapore’s national flower. Orchid themed gardens are the most popular places for visitors’ photo ops.

Singapore’s MRT system is an affordable way to get to Bay South Garden. You take CE (yellow Circle Line Marina Bay Extension) or DT (blue Downtown Line) Line and get off at CE1/DT16 Bayfront Station; follow the directions to Gardens by the Bay ticketing office. If you are not Singapore residents you can only buy the standard ticket at SD $28 for adult and 10% discount applies to the Singapore Airlines passengers (just show your boarding pass). Standard ticket covers admissions to both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The park shuttle services are available for SD $3 per person if you want to skip the walks from the ticketing area to the entrance of the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. You can get re-entry permit by having a stamp on you hand when you exit the exhibit building. The visits to the open area of the park is free but access to the Skyway OCBC needs another ticket and only opened when weather is permitted. We didn’t have an opportunity to visit it due to the storm forecast.

I recommend that you spend at least 3-4 hours to visit both conservatories and if time allowed visit other themed gardens in the park too. If you like you can download Plant Explorer App to assist your visits; otherwise the information boards and markers are displayed near the plants. The annual celebratory event is the Singapore Garden Festival. For this year it is held from July 21st-August 3rd."
,,The Cloud Forest is Out of This World - a MUST See in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the most amazing places in Singapore. We went straight up to the top by lift, and took in everything there was to see walking the way down. It was just fantastic - the flowers and greenery, the waterfalls, etc. We stayed in about an hour and a quarter. We could probably have stayed longer, but we wanted to go to the Flower Dome, and catch the show at the Supertree Grove."
,,Serene and refreshing,4.0,,"If you're visiting the gardens this is definitely a must-see. My wife and I visited in the morning before the crowds but I think we would have appreciated it more later in the day when it was hotter outside. The cool mist and relaxing sounds of the waterfall follow you through the entire exhibit and we left feeling rejuvenated. While we initially came to look at the fauna, we stayed longer just to soak it all in. I wish there were more places to sit and relax, but the path is designed to keep you moving. Comes highly recommended!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A wonderful experience, a welcome escape from the heat of Singapore and full of beautiful flowers and planths that are cleverly arranged to show how species vary according to elevation. The visit starts at the top and gradually returns you through the clouds to groud level.
The waterfall is spectacular, but my personal favourites were the carniverous plants and the micro-orchids."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,The waterfall at the entrance was really soothing and an escape from the summer heat. It felt like an amazing experience to be inside the Cloud forest. Must visit place in my opinion. We purchased our tickets from Klook which offers discount for Cloud forest+Flowerdome+OCBC skywalk. I think all of these places closes around 8pm so make sure you reach by evening and there will be huge queue at all places.
,,wow!,5.0,,"Very impressive! The visit is a must in Singapore. The walk in the Cloud Forest Tower is great. You can see, feel and smell nature."
,,Such a beautiful place,5.0,,"This place really does look as amazing as it does in the pictures. It can be quite crowded but generally you can still find a good spot to take pictures without too many people in it. You can also climb up and around the ""forest"" which may be scary for people who are scared of heights but it was still a good experience."
,,A visual delight away from the outside heat.,5.0,,One of my all time favourite places to come. You won’t know where to look first. After you’ve been seriously impressed and cooled off at the entrance by the waterfall your eyes will be drawn in all directions with the splendid display of foliage that is crammed into the most difficult of spaces! It is a living wall to behold. There are many areas to discover inside this dome and if time is short I would suggest this would be a better option to visit as it is cool in here and a welcome break from the Singapore heat. Take a light cardigan even. The gift shop is very impressive and you would satisfy all your tourist gift needs right here I’d imagine.
,,What a delight!,5.0,,"Even at 82 and 71 yrs of age we found exploring this gigantic vertical garden very manageable. It just drew you up and up (with the occasional escalator and elevator en route). Beautiful plantings and we can't imagine how they did this to begin with (let alone keep it up). Orchids, ferns, bromeliads, and wonderful trees with beautiful flowering plants everywhere. Really nothing like it!"
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,"A great way to escape the hot and humid weather of Singapore is to go and visit the Cloud Forest. It's an air-conditioning place and you will really feel cool once you enter inside. On the entrance you will be stunned by the largest waterfall. It's a very toursity area and you'll get lucky to get a photo of you solo, if there is not much people around you"
,,Awesome Garden,5.0,,I never been to any Garden before. But this time i really can enjoy this Garden. I am lucky to enter this garden before they are fogging the Garden. So i can witness how cool it was.
,,Stunning,4.0,,This was fantastic. We loved t. The giant waterfall was amazing. There were lots of people in the dome at the same time as us but we never felt like we were too cramped. I didn’t have any issues taking photos and everyone was the same in awe of the views.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,An amazing tourist site. Singapore is always ahead of the game with these sorts of things. We were lucky enough to be there when the 'clouds' were released. The architecture/engineering is amazing.
,,A nice afternoon treat overall,4.0,,"Pop on if you're doing the gardens by the Bay. The dome is refreshing on a hot day and has toilets etc. More as a nice escape from heat. Nice waterfall inside. Garden landscapes are a little boring after a while, but nice to walk through with friends."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Worth the long queue. Though Singapore is humid, the cloud Forest and the gardens, the domes are not! Strange but good for someone (like me) who comes from a humid land and does not want the same in another. Got a bit tired at the end, maybe got a bit monotonous or maybe too many people, kids also groaning so could be anything or everything. but definitely worth a visit."
,,AWESOME,5.0,,"AWESOME is an overused word by Americans, but this is a truly awesome creation - there is an enormous waterfall inside a giant greenhouse! - the design is stunning and the view is breathtaking - personally the nextdoor flower conservatory is put into the shade and I wouldn't bother with that one, but this one is a must!"
,,Cloud forest versus flower dome,5.0,,"This might be your question when in the area. We visited both. Unless you have a particular interest in flowers then I would choose the cloud forest. If you have no financial constraints then visit both. The short films on the environmental damage were very good. It was a shame that these did not contain Chinese subtitles to be honest, as it seems that part of the world is not too considerate of the environment."
,,"Stunning, so creative",5.0,,"We loved this -it's so beautiful and the plants and concept, the architecture is brilliant. We spent hours here and am so inspired to try and do a few things like we saw here in my garden at home. The gardeners who created this should be exceptionally proud of the incredible work -teh scuptures also are out of this world and it all felt like the landscape of the Avatar movie."
,,Impressive,5.0,,Another impressive attraction in Singapore. Been there a couple times taking visitors and the place just gets better as it ages since the plants have grown and its just beautiful and fresh inside. The waterfall is breathtaking and the whole set-up is superb .
,,The plant world not often seen,4.0,,"The cloud forests of the world are in places few people go so the plants that grow there are not often seen. In the Cloud Forest dome at Gardens by the bay there is an amazing high rise central core where you start by going by lift to the sixth floor and begin the walk down, on a gradual slope, observing the array of plants that cover the central core of the structure."
,,Great asset for city,5.0,,"Wish we had something like this in Auckland, New Zealand. Absolutely amazing environment and couldn't believe how good air conditioning was.... relief from the 30+ heat"
,,Stunning and a must see whilst at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This was a great experience to see plants, orchids, and exceptional craft work, on several levels and in a very unique way. If you are visiting Singapore, the Gardens by the Bay is an absolute No 1 priority to see and going inside both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome is what you go there to see. The rest of the gardens are great to walk around but the real attractions are in the two huge conservatory domes."
,,Astounding,5.0,,I've never seen anything quite like this. A must see for any visitor. Count on spending at least an hour inside the cloud forest alone and 2 or 3 more in the neighbouring attractions.
,,Superb - Special,5.0,,"This is an amazing 'greenhouse' with a layout which is spectacular - its huge and once inside, we were overwhelmed by the plants i9n there - loads of different varieties of orchids and other exotic tropical plants.
Beautifully laid out and beautifully kept; all pristine.
If you love plants the this is a must see place for you. Even the teens enjoyed it !!
Bit expensive but we thought it worth every dollar. And not that it can be busy at certain times."
,,Great place to escape the humidity,5.0,,Cool and refreshing place to visit. Enjoyed getting out of the humidity and into an air conditioned place. The in door water fall was great.
,,Worth it,4.0,,"Especially in the hot summer months, walking in here is not only a cool relief, the waterfall spritzes you and you feel instantly refreshed. Definitely one of my faves."
,,Really beautiful,5.0,,"I loved this place, it’s really beautiful. I also think the dedicated areas about damage and conservation are really important. I noticed they included ‘eat less meat’, which many establishments fail to acknowledge, so this caused me to find a lot of respect for the place! Really interesting and educational for all ages."
,,better than the flower,4.0,,"great views of the waterfall, but there is only one waterfall! nice walk around the gardens and walkways. enjoyable but not cheap!"
,,Wow!,5.0,,Not a gardener and accompanied by a typical 16 year old and we were amazed. Lots of people but it's an experience you cannot miss in Singapore - it is a relief from the heat and it provides some magnificent 'Insta' moments!
,,"Very nice dome with various unique plants inside, but expensive ticket to get in",3.0,,"It's an interesting place, especially if you appreciate various unique plants. However entrance ticket is not cheap."
,,Cool haven in the tropical heat,5.0,,"This is a massive structure with a very refreshing atmosphere in the tropical heat. Fantastic collection of plants, flowers and trees in a simulated altitude forest."
,,literall walk in the cloud,5.0,,"part of the garden by the bay area, nice little man-made rain forest. I thought it was gonna be very humid, but it's not. you'll have a great photo opportunity but make sure your footwear has a nice grip as the floor could be rather slippery at times. high heels are not recommended.

please be mindful of the rules around this attraction, I saw a group of people touching carnivorous plants despite the NO TOUCHING signs right next to the plant."
,,A RAIN FOREST IN THE CITY,4.0,,"This place was truly unique. In essence they have created a verticlal rainforest inside a dome in an open park in the city. You can walk to the top; however, there are internal elevators and escalators as well. It is really well done wiith the misting and the lush vegetaion. Additionally, they have inserted elaborate wood animal carvings around the park. Really worth seeing."
,,Very interesting....,4.0,,"Once you enter, you'll see an impressive man made waterfall. Great photo opportunity. Then as you make your way around, you can choose to climb a lot of stairs to get to the top and make your way down the ramp. Or you can also take a lift. Once you get to the top, the view is amazing. The ramp can get crowded and difficult to take photos without strangers in it. We went on a weekend so not sure if weekday is less crowded. Overall, you must visit at least once."
,,Not interresting,2.0,,"I'm sorry but i was disappointed. ok, it's cool if you see this like an attraction other wise ... not very interresting. If you want see this, during your travel in Malaisia and Singapore, reserve you some times to do a trail in the jungle."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay complex, really nice and amazing.The plants are exotic and their presentation is superb."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Its a man-made forest in the heart of the city. This is near Marina Sands, Merlion Park, Garden's by the Bay."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Wow, what a great experience. The flower forest next door, no so much, but this one is fantastic. We loved it."
,,Further to last review,5.0,,Hi really provided this review under the main garden’s section in TripAdvisor. Few extra notes: - it can get cool as is air-condition all year - good to experienced at day and at dusk
,,Excellent with amazing views,5.0,,"The best dome to walk in, with amazing views of the city as well. The waterfall is so nice to look at. My son loved every second."
,,A must do if you are at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"You need at least an hour or two to stroll up the walkways and to appreciate the beauty of the plants, flowers arrangements and the views."
,,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,5.0,,We went later in the evening after sunset for a totally different experience of both architecture design and the plants. At night the walkways are lit up and with the mist looks more like a UFO. It was also a lot less busy than during the day.
,,Cooler Place to Be,5.0,,"Singapore's weather is totally warm, but if you want to stay cooler, visit Gardens by the Bay where this man-made water falls make the surroundings cooler. It's majestic and beautiful!"
,,Outstandingly highly recommended,5.0,,Exquisite venue and awe inspiring creations. Highly educational whilst being relaxing. Love the fact whole site is undercover in cool air regulated envrt
,,"Nice place to visit, not a must-see",4.0,,"Good job of curating th species and explaining the different plants and interactions. There are few indoor gardens this size, and an indoor waterfall is interesting. Exhibits talk of environmentalismand conservation. Is a good exposure to different types of plants. Time inside the Cloud Forest can range from 20 mins to 3 hours, depending on background and interest."
,,Spectalur manmade garden,5.0,,"One year in singapore,Nature enthusiast,Not been to Cloud garden??
The inner calling urged me to head towards the place.Spectacular man made garden with a 360 view incoporation and some picturesque seating location.Highly recommended to explore the lost world(7th floor) and climb all the way down.The temperature is regulated to 23-25 degree celsius.Lovely waterfall mist is scintillating.The ticket charge was 18$ for both the cloud forest and the flower dome.If you are short on time ,please do visit atleast Cloud forest.Highly recommended to singapore tourist and residents alike."
,,Nice gardens,3.0,,To be honest the exhibit is lovely but unless you are a true gardener or plant lover you'll find yourself moving through it at a pretty brisk pace.
,,Amazing,5.0,,You must see this exhibit. Wonderful flowers and plants plus a waterfall. Great views out to the supertrees and bay.
,,Long Queue,3.0,,Need more elevator & provide rail for seniors. If we want to use wheel chair. I Think they should provide the acess.
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"It is absolutely stunning in the cloud forest- a must-see in Singapore. Just check the ""misting times"" which is every 2 hours and make sure you are there when that starts. Try not to go on the weekends as it is soooooo busy!"
,,Spectacular orchids,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens, plants and views but the orchids are spectacular. Lovely and cool inside, an added bonus if you are there when they mist the plants. there are also a lot of sculptures throughout the complex, many from various woods."
,,A little bit of world gone mad,3.0,,"A nice enough experience but expensive and the whole time I couldnt help but think why cant we take care of our real forests as well as we do this fake version! I cant imagine the energy it takes to light, power and plumb this fantastical garden."
,,cool oasis..,5.0,,its interesting.. more importantly a great place to potter and cool down.. most welcomed oasis .....
,,Quite busy in the middle of the day,4.0,,"Came back here for another visit with the kids, having just renewed the annual membership. It remains an impressive place to visit with the waterfall and the various cold climate plants. The walkway is also good, but just a little busy for my liking. Earlier in the day is a better time to visit."
,,Cool!,5.0,,Cloud Forest is cool. You'll notice the temperature drop the moment you walk in. Right at the entrance you will be greeted by a big waterfall. So high that you may feel the water droplets. Explore the different levels and make sure you go all the way to the top. You'll be rewarded with a grand view.
,,Nice concept,5.0,,"I liked how this place has been built with a verticle tower of flowers in the center. The mist spray makes it really cool. The end time is 8 pm, so try to have enough time so that you can visit the other observatories as well."
,,On top of the world,5.0,,Breathtakingly beautiful. You will be in ore. Very comfortable inside. You will not know where to look first.
,,Begin Your Visit The Gardens From Here,5.0,,"As you enter the cloud forest you are welcomed by this water fall that sets the tone for rest of the visit. The spiral walk in the cloud forest takes you through levels where you have opportunity to see numerous tropical species of plants.

You must start the visit to the gardens with the cloud forest. The waterfall at the entrance will certainly set the mood for the visit to the gardens by the bay."
,,Amazing,4.0,,You must visit this as it is such a great creation .we were fascinated by the work to make it and the many plants it took to make it possible. Very clever
,,Incredible! Put it on your must-see list!,5.0,,"We had limited time in Singapore but decided that this should be on our to-do list, and we're so glad it was.

We went fairly early in the day to avoid the heat, but inside the dome is cooler anyway. There are walkways all through the dome at different levels, along platforms and overlooking the gardens and out over the city.
There are lots of information signs, as well as displays about the impact of humans on the environment, presented in a really interactive way.

Loved it here, and will definitely come back."
,,The waterfall!,5.0,,I was absolutely blown away by the waterfall inside! There's a platform on top that gives better viewing angles.
,,Magical Visit,5.0,,A magical place to visit and wonder through. Lovely cool change from the weather outside and the range of beautiful plants is amazing. View from the top level and walk along elevated paths may be a little daunting for those wary of heights! Would definitely visit again.
,,A great experience,4.0,,"We were quite surprised at how cold the cloud forest was. We’d expected it to be hot and humid but the cool temperatures made it easy to walk round.

We particularly loved the walkways which meander round the dome, getting highs and higher. The views from the top were amazing, and well worth the climb.

There are places to sit and rest, and it makes a pleasant break from the stifling temperatures outside.

The tropical plants are fascinating, but I’m not sure it’s the right place to bring children."
,,Mind blowing feat of human design,5.0,,"My highlight of Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest is a stunning piece of engineering and design. A visually stunning place, the green house itself is impressive, let alone the waterfall.

You start the experience at the bottom of the waterfall and follow a path that weaves through the waterfall structure - don't worry you won't get wet! :)"
,,WORTH IT.,5.0,,"If you are elderly or bad walking you may find this a bit hard going, but persevere, it is worth it....trust Singapore to do it this well, always up front with wonderful things to see, every visit has new wonders to behold and I found this one of them.....
."
,,Gorgeous!,5.0,,"Absolutely loved visiting the cloud forest, the cool temperature was a welcome change & there were so many informative, interesting displays & unusual flowers. We liked how many differing pathways and exhibits you could visit & it wasn’t too crowded even though it was busy. Disappointed the flower dome wasn’t open as we’d heard great things about it too."
,,Slippery in places but not physically difficult,3.0,,"Although this venue is not physically difficult it does involve heights which would make those with balance issues or a dislike for high places, uneasy. It was interesting enough as an attraction but definitely the poor cousin to the Garden Dome next door which is fabulous and a must see. The walkway down from the top had views and pleasing displays. Personally I would not take children very far into this venue and access for strollers or wheelchairs might be not worth the effort.The staff were keeping a very good eye on public safety on the day that we visited. The display involving canoes and giant plants was rather good."
,,Great for leisurely stroll with family,4.0,,"Great to take a leisurely stroll for Flora lovers, got a few nice places to take photos for your Instagram or Facebook posts. Pretty boring if you don't like looking at plants and just taking a walk and enjoying the scenery."
,,Brilliant,4.0,,An absolutely lovely place to visit and great for the whole family. The only let down is that if you have buggies you do have to use the lofts which are very small and somewhat abused by people who don't necessarily need them. Make you when you reach the end to double back if you have a buggy as otherwise you will miss a good portion on the final floor and won't know otherwise (I only knew as my husband took the escalators). Lots of opportunities for photos and lots of information are provided.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Really nice environment and felt like we were in Jurassic Park only down fall was it was so busy people were pushing each other
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,We spent a couple of hours at the Cloud Forst when we visited Gardens by the Bay. This is an awesome place if you are into plants. There are two skywalks and it was great to see the plants on top as well. There is a good exhibit at the end explaining the threats on flora and fauna as well. We went on a Saturday afternoon which was quite busy so maybe better to go during the week but it might be so popular that is always busy anyway.
,,Amazing and it is air conditioned!,5.0,,"It was nice to visit and see the indoor waterfall as well as the various flora. There were various levels where you could see and learn about the plant life. During the summer, it offers a nice respite from the summer heat as you enjoy the indoor views. Some people were sitting on the benches and just enjoying their time there. Don't forget to visit the theater to learn more about the effects on our environment."
,,Captivating forest,5.0,,This was an amazing experience. The thought and planning that has gone into this stunning forest makes it somewhere definitely worth visiting.
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,The structures and flowers swept me off my feet. The sunset view was awesome and a lot of flowers I have not seen before amazed me thoroughly.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I bought my tickets online prior to visiting Singapore.

Both conservatories are worth the entry fee, but this was my favourite out of the two. Because it is cooled and indoors, you can really visit despite the weather outside - rain, shine or thunderstorm.

You will be amazed at the entrance by the waterfall. It is well-kept and you can see the gardeners busily working away to make sure it is all perfect.

I visited in the morning just a little past its opening time in attempt to avoid a large crowd. There were school children there at that time on excursion."
,,The Cloud Forest with its wonderful waterfall.,5.0,,"One of the features of Gardens by the Bay is the Cloud Forest, dominated by its waterfall. You can meander to the top of the dome, past lush ferns, trees and flowers and even stand behind the waterfall for a different perspective, but coming down is not for the faint-hearted. If you are afraid of heights it is best to use the escalator. This is an amazing place and well worth a visit."
,,Amazing. A Singapore 'must do'!,5.0,,"The brilliance of the garden set-up, the wide range of plants all laid out in forest floor to mountain top. The 'cloud' feature adds another mystical element to an already great attraction. The architecture of the structure is also an amazing thing to behold. Well done Singapore."
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"Highly recommended, great activity to with adults and kids alike. It is quite a climb up the centre, or a long wait for the lift, but totally worth the amazing climb down."
,,Charming,5.0,,"Seeing from the outside, the dome looks like any other green house. One look on the inside, and you realize that you are standing in the midst of a man made jungle, which on any day could compete a hollywood set.

Beautiful waterfall, mind blowing plantation and so much to adore on every floor, the cloud forest for those who crave for an escape from the concrete jungles into a real one, minus the animals :)"
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,Words cannot express the beauty of this place. There is so much to see and the views are just spectacular. Pay the entrance fee and enjoy!
,,The falls are great view,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is amazeballs... We went there twice and it was always a great feeling be there and see a lot of colourful flowers inside the forest. You can roam around every level.
,,Must Visit,4.0,,Beautifully created to show how important it is for us to preserve the nature. You go seven floor up by either elevator or by stairs and then come down using sky walk. It looks amazing!
,,Love the Orchids,5.0,,I'm an orchid enthusiast.. I found many beautiful orchid hybrid such as cattleyas in there. I found many of the species too.. which rarely found in the forest now.. we enjoy our time there so much.. the walking path and the waterfall keep our enjoyment to the max.. don't forget to take the picture from the highest level of the walking path..
,,Cool place,5.0,,We have a annual pass for Cloud Forest. It is a magnificent place indeed. Various of plants and flowers to see.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The waterfall is the 1st sight that you see when you entered the forest, it's really beautiful. Then take a lift to the top floor and walking down is really a nice and relax walk. The atmosphere is really good and it seems like walking in a modern forest. It's really a worthwhile visiting the Cloud Forest and the Flower dome."
,,One of a kind greenhouse attraction in tropical Singapore,4.0,,Visit for a breath-taking experience. It is the gem of the huge Gardens By The Bay. It also gives a welcome respite from the heat in the open park.
,,Average,3.0,,"A bit disappointing, expected more. The walk through the forest was ok, but a bit basic and not a lot to look at."
,,Good to bring friends from abroad,5.0,,"The cloud dome in Gardens by the Bay boast many interesting scenic views and natural scent to embrace and enjoy.

It’s air-conditioned, and definitely an attraction you’d wanna take your time to explore. Apart from plants, exhibitions of the earth geographic formation structure, as well as precious stones are featured.

A good place to get lost in."
,,Stepping into an eco spaceship,4.0,,"Being a local, we have never set foot into the paid enclosures. But decided to give our money a run since there’s discount for locals.
It was amazing inside! Walking on the mid-air bridges, with lights illuminated both in the enclosure and outside, with mist spraying every hour that looked like clouds, it almost seems like we are walking through in eco spaceship! Simply brilliant and will definitely be back, not just for the flora exhibits but for the cooler temperature of course!
However, 2nd level’s stalagmite display was quite an eye sore to its surrounding and the dripstones looked so fake, this exhibits is completely irrelevant, should either convert into a proper stalagmite cave or simply take them out."
,,Nature as it could be,5.0,,"Indoor forest, as nature as it could be, it is amazing, we went there summer time, but in the cloud forest, it is cool, very feel like nature forest."
,,Fantastic Experience,5.0,,Whilst both domes are worthwhile the cloud forest is spectacular. The waterfall inside is fantastic and the hidden gardens at the end are beautiful. The walk around starting at the top of the mountain is excellently implimented.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"We went there in evening and it was really nice for us. Very impresive. The whole main idea is even more impressive, that it supports using of reusable energy sources. We absolutely loved it. :)"
,,At the bottom of the rainforest...,5.0,,A visit not to be missed both for the variety of plants and flowers as for the work of meticulous reconstruction! We may not like false authenticity and decorative elements that do not bring much but the brilliance of colors and the diversity of plants can make forget this fault of bad taste ...
,,Just like avatar movie.,5.0,,Artificial but beautiful and innovative. worth he money. you go up by elevator and then you walk down floor by floor enjoying the super nice views. breath taking Singapore and wonderful architecture.
,,Cloud Forest -,3.0,,If one loves flowers it will be great for you. We like flowers but after having seen a few it was let's move on. There is a lot of walking to get to this event so better wear good shoes. The waterfall was okay. It is not something I would go to again but it is impressive in set up.
,,Fantasy in the clouds,5.0,,"One word describes the cloud dome..FANTASTIC!! Not knowing what to expect, we were in awe and loved every minute. The waterfalls and slow ascend to the top of the dome walking in misty clouds was outstanding. The beautiful hanging gardens with a variety of orchids and other moisture loving plants made us feel that we were in a fantasy world."
,,Beautiful and serene location,5.0,,"came back for a second visit, as we enjoyed it so much last trip. By far the most interesting of the two domes, with a variety of plants, award-winning orchids, artificial waterfall and great views. We even saw the Singapore Air Force practicing flybys for the upcoming national day! Wouldn't bother with the Flower Dome again, but love this one."
,,Beautiful and unique indoor forrest,5.0,,"Was really surprised at its beauty and architecture. The waterfalls and vertical gardens and plants were so breathtaking. Well maintained and clean. Especially liked the lessons learned at the end... that we should all take care of nature because this is our future
Lovely visit we didn’t to leave!"
,,Worth the visif,5.0,,Very informative and something you wouldn't expect to see in the middle of a city. Great attraction for all ages at a reasonable cost.
,,Walk through in the cool of the evening,4.0,,We recently walked through the CloudForrest after sunset. The lighting effects that they have installed work well with all of the different plants and provide a great effect. The cool of the evening made the whole experience very comfortable.
,,Selfie heaven,2.0,,Sooo many tourists taking selfies and photos on the walkways it was annoying trying to stop and avoid them. Very busy and unpleasant. Pretty displays but hard to take in because of overcrowding.
,,Well-done attempt to explain ecosystem gradation in tropical mountains,5.0,,"Of course in the end it is a manmade reflection on complex ecosystems, but the Cloud Forest giant green house is extremely well done, and for those attentive to the information given there is a lot to learn. Not for people with vertigo. It is a must-see part of the Gardens by the Bay. Nice orchid exhibit in one corner on ground level."
,,They have carnivore plants!,5.0,,"I love plants, and I like to be surrounded by nature, eventough this place is man-made forest, but once you're in there you'll be mesmerized. My most excited is the carnivorous plants! The have lots of nephentes from small to big size! Love it!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,I have read so many things in trip advisor before I came but being actually there is an amazing feeling! What have Singaporeans made is crazy! A cloud forest with waterfalls and a beautiful route to walk! Would definitely recommend!
,,You must do it,5.0,,A must when in Singapore. Well worth the money. It is almost undelivable that that have built and planted so many of my favourite plants
,,"There's an orchid corner, very interesting",5.0,,"There's orchid corner. Lots of beautiful unique types of orchid at that little corner. Very interesting. They have a great idea to change the theme once a while also, so one could expect seeing other plants/ flower on another visit."
,,Manufactured tourist destination,3.0,,"There are waterfalls, loads of plants from diffferent countries, temperature controlled environment and a multitude of plant and floral displays."
,,Not as good as flower doom,4.0,,"This is not as impressive as flowerdoom. If you would to choose one of them choose the flower doom, even if you dont like flowers as me you would still be more impressed at the flower doom.
This one just as the flower doom is very crowded but here the paths are smaller making it more crowded, more hot while at the same time not offering as much as the flower doom visually or otherwise.
If yoi have time and money so see it, otherwise skip it and enjoy the free lightshowe at treedom instead."
,,Cloud Forest - An Indoor Air-Conditioned Forest,5.0,,"What an amazing concept.....marvellous. Creating a forest indoor is not an easy job. Great Applaud for the designers.

The moment you enter inside you feel entering in forest with a waterfall . Amazing collections of greenery & plants.

Just wonder why Gulf Countries fail to recreate this theme over there. This theme is ideal for Gulf.

No words to describe the experience just visit................."
,,"Lovely displays, educational, cool retreat",5.0,,"One of the glass domes of Gardens by the Bay. Features cool climate plants from tropical montane regions. Colourful orchids, carnivorous plants (including pitcher plants and Venus fly traps), ferns, conifers, rhododendrons, etc. From the top of a 35 m waterfall walk your way down a walkway with various levels of themes and information. The Hidden Garden below has a wealth of displays including micro-orchids. Adult entry fee $14."
,,Misty wonderful experience,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a huge air conditioned dome with a tropical forest inside
The first think you see is a huge man made waterfall
You take a lift up several levels and walk you way back down through a series of ramps thru different levels of the rainforest, taking in all the beautiful plants and landscape."
,,Em's on Tour,5.0,,"What a magical place.
Situated in the Grounds of Gardens by the Bay this biosphere is well worth a visit.
The plants and waterfall, the slow incline to reach the Clouds is so well worth a visit.
On a hot or wet day outside this garden is a haven as the temperate climate is refreshing.
The floral displays of orchids and other exotic flowering plants was an absolute treat."
,,Landscape Rain forest,5.0,,"Truly feel like moving around the rain forest with flora around but no fear of fauna. Can't get better than this ,visited in the summer month when it is sultry out in Singapore but being in this place feels great.."
,,Amazing place to visit.,5.0,,Amazing place to visit. To see a waterfall indoors is awesome as well as to walk through it is just crazy.
,,Nothing too special,3.0,,"Large crowded that made you feel ""cattled"" on a certain route. Air con space but the amount of people really took away from its beauty for me"
,,very lovely place,4.0,,"beautiful decor , nice attraction to go to if you are a tourist coming to singapore. :) very nice scenery as well"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"I had always associated glasshouses with heat and humidity. So I was delighted to find that the Cloud Forest is cooled to provide a climate to grow plants from the high altitude forests of the tropics. Many interesting specimens, many fully grown mature trees. An added delight was watching the reaction of a group of pre-schoolers who were just so excited!"
,,Home of the selfie,4.0,,An impressive construction within Gardens by the Bay with a wonderful indoor waterfall and aerial walkways. Beset by people concentrating on getting their best side in shot rather the building itself. (I’m not sure what the crystal cave is all about other than filling the space up though...)
,,Pay for access but a must,5.0,,Its all part of the experience you need a ticket but worth doing. There was no queues this time of the year. I was surprised by the height of the walkways well worth doing even though I don't like heights...
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,"The indoor waterfall was amazing, the different heights had plants from different areas. Lots of amazing views."
,,Wow,5.0,,This garden is very well worth the visit. We loved every moment of our over 2 hours visit. Very easy to get to by the metro.
,,Amazing rainforest,5.0,,The place is so beautiful that it is difficult to believe it has been created. The tree walk down is really amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed
,,Family Visit,4.0,,Cloud forest is amazing and well worth the money. I would definitely recommend for first time visitors
,,Amazing views!!,5.0,,"This is a man-made forest complete with waterfall, forest and aerial walkways. Views are excellent within and outside Dome and plenty of photo opportunities. Its really amazing the way Singaporeans have created this man-made wonder!! Carry a shawl / light jacket with you, temperatures can be quite cold inside especially if its hot outside. It can get quite crowded in the dome and there can be a waiting of 15-20 minutes for the lift. However, its all very well organized. Lot of information is provided about various species of plants at various places, kids will enjoy. A must visit when in Singapore."
,,Enchanting!!!,5.0,,"Absolutely loved the Cloud Forest! Definitely coming back on my next visit to Singapore. Beautiful flowers, interesting exhibits, great place to take photos & learn more about nature. Great views of the Marina area from inside as well."
,,Cool haven,5.0,,The waterfall is beautiful. It is possible to view it and the surrounding plants from the bottom and the top with walkways winding around the structure. We were there for ‘the misting’ - light mist of water from below the walkways which adds a magical feel to the place.
,,Like Nothing I’ve Ever Seen,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is the best garden we have ever been to. It is air conditioned which is very refreshing from the Singapore humidity. You make your way up to the top and go down. It is the most beautiful thing we have ever seen. The photos we have taken look edited but all the beauty is real. I highly recommend going.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"One of the dome of Garden by the bay. exceptional well designed, artificial waterfall will take your mind"
,,Highlight of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Weather controlled waterfall. It gives us an experience for which we would have had to travel very far.

Depending upon ones background; it may or may not enrich your experience. For me it was a first inside a structure as such. i really enjoyed it. Its a place worth going at least once."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"The Clod Forrest is such a stunning place it should be on everyone's ""must do"" list for Singapore whether you are into gardening, horticulture or not. Its extremely well laid out on several levels and with stunning views of trees, plants flowers and the city outside. I would go again given the opportunity."
,,Simply WOW,5.0,,You must not miss watching the wonderful indoor waterfall. We did not even realized that we spent 2 hours here. Stunning view and best place to take selfies :-)
,,This is a must see when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"This has to be one of the best gardens I have visited, it is absolutely stunning, you expect it to be humid and tropical but instead it is a cool and welcome retreat on a hot Singapore day. wether you are a garden lover or not , this will impress."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The cloud forest is absolutely awesome from top to bottom it is an array of trees and plants from all
Over the world. You wonder who dreams up these places to visit . It houses the tallest indoor waterfall
And is cleverly designed to take your breath away well wort a visit ."
,,Nicely done and must see,4.0,,"Natural water fall and the flora and fauna ... must see ... the concept itself is very beautiful, well maintained"
,,Huge indoor waterfall,5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the Bay and simply amazing. An indoor rainforest with a huge waterfall and I just loved the sky walk. Beautiful flora and just so much to see. There is even an area with some beautiful big crystals. Just wowed me the whole time.
,,Never Seen any thing like this!,5.0,,"such a beautiful multifaceted area, sections with display of sculpture , figurines and plants were out of this world, never seen so many bBegonia's in one place in my life, did not know there were so many types, just breathtaking."
,,Cloud forest - cloud 9!,5.0,,Brilliant Definitely a must see in Singapore. Surprisingly cool. Great photo opportunities. Artistically arranged - beautiful.
,,Experience of a life time,5.0,,It’s an amazing concept and the rainforest setup indoor is great. The variety of flora that typically grows in rainforest can be all seen in one place. I loved the pitcher plants and the variety of orchids
,,Really enjoyable visit - and nice to get out of the heat,5.0,,"We had a great visit hear, really enjoyable. If you only have time for one of the domed gardens I would choose this one."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Nice and cold in here and beautiful waterfall. Definitely leave this dome until last when visiting the Gardens
,,Wander about the tropical rain forest...,5.0,,"To be honest, we hesitated due to the fee to enter this and the Flower Dome but SO glad we bought the tickets and experienced these wonderlands! It’s beyond anything I’ve ever seen all in one place... Incredible beauty! So well laid out and done! There’s also a lesson to be learned at the end of your tour of the rain forest which is perfect for world awareness of our water problems in the world today."
,,See the world's tallest indoor waterfall,4.0,,"Adjacent to the Flower Dome is the Cloud Forest Dome where a series of escalators, elevators and walkways transport you through and around a man-made “mountain” from which the world’s tallest indoor waterfall cascades 115 feet to a pool below."
,,Wonderful place to b,5.0,,Cloud forest ... a beautiful place ... well maintained ....amazing ... mind blowing ... wen u enter from the scorching heat to this place its like heaven ... a tour to this place will actually make u feel as if u r a part of this place ... many people at every nuk n corner r there to guide u ....mesmerizing atmosphere
,,Stunning Foilage,5.0,,"Going inside the Cloud Forrest was so beautiful and refreshing with all the beautiful water falls, the plants were amazing.Well worth going and its so close to other attractions."
,,MIght be better than the Eden Project!,5.0,,Really loved these domes full of exotic plants from all over the world. They had a massive display of dahlias when we were there. The overhead walk gives you another great dimension. Would have spent longer there but it was our last day and we still had so much to see!
,,A man-made nature,5.0,,"This is one of the two gardens at gardens by the bay. This is an air conditioned dome with a man made tropical rain forest inside. The waterfall is amazing and without the dome, it would have been difficult to differentiate from actual rain forest. It also has some birds which add more beauty to the dome. This is a must visit place if you are in Singapore and if you are a nature lover."
,,Simply lovely and enjoyable!,4.0,,"A lovely, cooling, cosy and safe ""forest"" to visit. No unwanted encounters with creepy crawly. Just enjoy the slow walk inside this uniquely build cloud forest and be with the plants.

Beside the plant, the scenery outside this glass dome cloud forest (near the top) is nice."
,,A place to be,5.0,,It seems nothing special and most probably it is but still gives you the possibility to see and touch the integration of men and wildlife. Well done!
,,see how is man made nature possible,4.0,,Different types of plants and ferns that grow around the world can be found here. The place is great for young children and another alternative spot to have a great view of southern part of singapore without staying in the hotel nearby (MBS).
,,Highlight of our visit to Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The cloud forest and the world's largest indoor waterfall is something to see. Don't visit Singapore and miss seeing the Cloud Forest. It is spectacular no mater what age you are as my college age kids loved it! And the indoor setting provided a wonderful break from the heat and intermittent rain.
,,On Cloud Nine!,5.0,,"Cloud Forest, Flower Dome & Gardens By the Bay is one or our getaways in Singapore because it is cheaper than therapy! The Forest is very cool, and very cooling. However, we do not approach it as an attraction but as an atmosphere. Every attempt has been made to give that natural rain forest environment. We always feel refreshed after leaving. Highly recommended and better to go during less busy days or seasons. Whether you are a traveler or local, Cloud Forest and Gardens By the Bay is a must see experience!"
,,Unique,4.0,,"As a Singaporean, I think this is one of a must go attractions. Usually when people ask me what can I do in Singapore. I mostly say its the food. But since there is a gardens by the bay. I would this attraction is a unique exhibition. Only go when there is an event, it makes the ticket worth while"
,,This is a must see if any interest in gardens at all,5.0,,"I rarely snap photos on my cell phone or digital camera preferring instead to simply enjoy whatever I am doing without the intrusion of the camera. However, I must have taken around 30 or 40 photos of the magnificent arrangements of the plants here. Whomever the gardener/designer is Ta is a master. (The languages here are English, Mandarin and Tamil) The transient portion of the exhibits are less than 100% but still worthy. There is a cafe inside which if you can get a reservation and table is a wonderful spot for afternoon tea in the English tradition."
,,Good for environmental issues,3.0,,Good to see the water fall and clouds and environmental issues are explained in detail. Can be seen.
,,Amazing,5.0,,It was amazing. We loved it. It's something for all ages. The world's tallest indoor waterfall is something you can't miss to see one your trip to Singapore.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,The place is really nice and cool. we got to go all the up the waterfall and appreciate the view from above.
,,Lovely,4.0,,"the cloud forest is worth a visit, lots of tropical plants, waterfalls and statues/carvings. Walked round it in an hour but I suppose you could be there for longer if you like plants!"
,,Crowded,4.0,,The price of It was a little high and it was crowded. The one way walk through the building was a little hokey but to manage the people who are visiting there is nothing else they could do. It was worth going and there are some great plants and the man made waterfall and clouds were good. It is a must see but don't go expecting to have a quiet singular experience.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"The cloud forest is a section in the garden by the bay, that is fully airconditioned. It has various plants and an artificial waterfall. A lot of walking is required. Another interesting thing was artificial plants made from lego. There is a ticket to enter the cloud forest and flower dome."
,,Amazing,4.0,,The amazing display from the waterfall to the different discussion rooms and exhibits was impressive. A pity about the large crowd which made movement and proper viewing and enjoyment difficult.
,,So Amazing was very very impressed,5.0,,"Thank you so much for ”Gowrie” She is my new friend we meet at ”Garden by the bay ”

,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"I just want to move there. Do not miss the site. It is breath taking, so much green and tranquility. Amazing!!!!!"
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,On a warm humid afternoon it was lovely to step into this space even before grasping what I was looking at. Never thought you could have a living natural art gallery but they have pulled it off here. Look carefully as you walk around at rocks and pieces of wood carved and shaped into animals of the forest. Huge army keep the place shaped but natural and have seen so many ideas I can duplicate on a smaller scale. This is my favourite attraction so far and will come back again.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is really beautiful, if you love flowers and orchids, this will really amaze you. At the entrance you have an impressive waterfall and a wall cover eith plants and flowers. You can climb to the top and tour the whole site going down. It’s a must in Singapore! Enjoy!"

,,Truly Spectacular,5.0,,We only had half a day in Singapore between flights and top of the list of things to do was to see the Cloud Forest and it did not disappoint. It was so unbelievably beautiful and awe inspiring to walk through the forest almost exactly like you are in a cloud. We used the transfer service which was well run and we have the most spectacular photo's and memories of the cloud forest. 100% a must do in Singapore.
,,Futuristic,5.0,,The place seems like a nature to see in the future - the man made falls is so real and the plants around is more than refreshing
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Entrance to the cloud forest requires tickets. It has an amazing artificial waterfalls. The forest has a variety of plants , trees and flowers. The cloud forest is quite far from the garden entrance , so you can make use of the shuttle by paying 3$ for unlimited rides in one single day."
,,A very nice garden.,5.0,,a very nice and cool place to visit and explore the diverse plants and flowers they have inside the garden. a must see place in the gardens by the bay area.
,,Explore Cloud Forest,4.0,,"A mysterious breath-taking mountain views, surrounded by diverse vegetation, floral and founa. It is the largest glass greenhouse. The beautiful thing is it changes the display of flowers and plants as it coincide with season.
As you enter into Cloud Forest, you will be greeted by a man made 35 meters tall waterfall, as you walk along be fascinated by the plants at the planted walks. Look out for the “Pitcher Plants”, it’s a cup-shaped leaves and it look harmless, but it actually kills and digests insects and small animals that venture within.

,,Wow!,5.0,,"Amazing how they have put this together, if you love gardens you'll love this. definitely worthwhile."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The forest dome is part of the gardens at Marina Bay. They are quite spectacular. The gardens are free however there is an entry fee to the forest and/or flower dome. We only went to the forest. It is luscious greenery as you walk slowly up towards the lifts. Be careful that at some stage a queue begins to form for the lift to take you up to the overhead walk. The queue was not obvious as there are many people taking photos. Perhaps some barriers would help earlier on once you enter. You can jump the queue for the lifts by walking up the 4 flights of stairs.
Once you are on the walkway you have beautiful views of the tropical forest with plenty of photo opportunities as you wind your way back down through the crystal gallery and a video presentation.
We loved our visit."
,,A great spectacle,5.0,,A wonderful respite from the heat and humidity of Singapore. It is a lovely place to relax and also a spectacular engineering structure.

,,Do not miss this,5.0,,The most amazing structure and a wonderful place to spend a few hours. So many plants from all over the world beautifully displayed.
,,Totally worth paying to enter,5.0,,"Almost surreal walking through the cloud forest. Lush greenery and sounds of water. The psychedelic lights are a bit much, though.

You need to pay for a ticket to get to the air conditioned areas like the flower dome and cloud forest but it is totally worth it."
,,A great surprise,5.0,,"We decided to visit the Cloud Forest as it was a hot day and the temperature inside the dome was cool. However, the visit was worth the time and we all enjoyed it. I would recommend a visit."
,,Boardwalk delight,5.0,,Greeted with the towering waterfall on entering the dome led to a delightful boardwalk journey through rainforest flora and fauna. Mist spurts along the journey added to the feel and atmosphere within the gardens.
,,Wonderful Place,5.0,,"Watching Sakura bloom in an airconditioned dome is a unique experience in hot hot hot Singapore. Getting tickets online will be much cheaper at the ticket booth on site. The indoor waterfall is also a great experience.

Even Kim Jong Un went there for selfie. That speaks volume."
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,"Welcomed cool respite from the hot temperatures of Singapore .....beautiful gardens, waterfalls and all things tropically botanical contained under an impressive glass dome. Only negative is that having not purchased headphones we found that the printed information about specific exhibits was insufficient......would highly recommended"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,The cloud forest dome amazing and the waterfall inside was a fantastic sight to see. The plants and flowers were amazing and so was the sky walk at the top of the waterfall. Definately would recommend!
,,Outstanding achievement of design,5.0,,"This is a must see if you have time in Singapore as you will be amazed by the mountain under the dome!
Definitely accessible if that is a worry as my teenage daughter had a wheelchair which will test the limits of any attraction. The staff was very well trained and had a smile on! The flowers are amazing in variety! Check it out!"

,,Wonderful Experience.,5.0,,"By day or night, this is a wonderful place to enjoy. The amazing variety of plants was a delight, and walking the skywalk was so thrilling. There is so much to enjoy in the Cloud Forest, and it should not be missed."
,,Stunning,4.0,,Cloud Forest located within Gardens by the Bay is worth every cent of the entrance fees. Beautifully laid out with twists and turns making it fun for adults and kids alike. A world of wonder awaits the visitors. Highly recommended
,,Long wait,5.0,,Was over a 45 minute wait so we never went inside only giving 5 stars due to the amazing work done inside
,,EXCELLENT,5.0,,It was wonderful experience. Great leisure time spending with family. Must visit this place surely..
,,Surprised,5.0,,"A little gem, amazing display of nature at its finest. There was a lot of walking but it's worth it to look down from the top."
,,"Very ""Avatar""",4.0,,"An amazingly effective experience. Beautiful, educational and spectacular. However, I hope that gardens under a dome aren't our our future.. And the plants were almost too perfect because there were no birds, or butterflies or bees etc"
,,Amazing Setting,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest in the Gardens by the Bay was my Favourite. There was the waterfall, skywalk, so many different plants, the cave area one area after another with another surprise."
,,A good walk,5.0,,"A very photogenic place and if coming in large group, can be parted into two parties and you can take photos of each other with majestic backdrop, either in bird-eye view or from the ground up."
,,Overwhelming,5.0,,Potentially the highlight of my trip. It was highly anticipated and didn’t disappoint. A must see in Singapore.
,,A Green Initiative,4.0,,The newly constructed cloud forest is a welcome green initiative in exhibiting the flora. the falls is an added attraction.tickets are a bit pricy.but Singapore is a costly city.
,,Just a sight not a sigh!,3.0,,One would visit this for the sake of visiting. Hardly memorable. Artificial. Displays are reasonable and some excitement with orchids. Other than that it lacks something. Misting May be the most exciting part of the trip
,,A must see while in Singapore!,5.0,,"It was such a cool & different experience to go to the Cloud Forest while we were spending the day in Singapore. Its amazing how there are so many different types of plants, trees, flowers, & fauna that are found throughout the world, all in one place! Make sure to take the lift to the 6th level & walk down to each level taking everything in. Take the time to watch/read all of the information throughout the exhibits regarding eco awareness & the simple little things that you can do/change in your everyday life to contribute to the planet. We went about an hour & 1/2 until closing & there was no line to get to the top level. I can still smell the freshness of all of the different plants & things. Highly recommended!"
,,Make sure your Camera is fully charged.,5.0,,"You could spend hours, exploring this enclosed very large garden with it vast array of vegetation and water fall. Very nice."
,,South East Aisa Adventures,5.0,,"This was a pleasant surprise. The orchids were gorgeious and the fragrance of all the flowers was amazing. The walk up into the 'clouds' lloks at the different plants, trees and flowers that are natural to that kind of habitat. If in Singapore, visit this amazing place."
,,Coolest forest hand made I have been,5.0,,"It was really hot before I took the ticket going inside the cloud forest. Unblievable. Cool. Maybe 3 or 4 floor going up to see everything. Looking down and see thing and people below you was amazing. Of course, you will listen to some of biological audio and filming.
Best place in Singapore"
,,Nice reprieve from heat,4.0,,"The cloud forest won’t wow you, but is still a good visit and reprieve from the heat. Get their early to beat the crowds. The best bit for me was the focus on climate change and environmental issues. That was boosted my rating from a 3 to a 4."
,,One of those must see places,5.0,,"Together with the adjacent Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest certainly has some magic to it. Impecabbly maintained flora offer a perfect way to enjoy a few hours wandering through the expansive structure in comfort."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"All I can say is “wow”.

This is a MUST visit in Singapore, as a majestic balance of engineering brilliance and natural beauty.
It is an inspiring place , yet peaceful and tranquil. The rainforest experience is only surpassed by the surreal beauty of the waterfall upon entering.
Definitely on the highly recommended list of places to visit."
,,Holiday,5.0,,"Great on a hot day lovely to visit with the family, lovely and cool inside with amazing plants and flowers."
,,Freshness,5.0,,Rain forest and lost paradise. Something about which modern mankind has almost or already lost like dinosaurs.
,,Cloud forest review,5.0,,"I went to see the Cloud forest on June 9, 2018 Saturday. It is best to visit this attraction in the day light. It is very close to Bay Front MRT station. One can also enter from the Marina Bay Sands Mall. There are eating places and toilets nearby. No dress code. Very good for taking photos. Must see attraction for adults and children."
,,Amazing day or night very cool inside !,5.0,,"its cool because its naturally air conditioned , many many plants and flowers hanging from amazing towers. you go up a lift and spiral you way down. there is a giant cooling waterfall cascading down and at the end a secret garden . see it if you can manage a few hours its worth it !"
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"Definitely a must visit when in Singapore, Something a little different. Great attraction for all ages, highly recommend"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"What an excellent place, and even though you have to pay, it remains excellent value for money. Have been to the Eden Project, and this shows what can be delivered with a few more years experience and learnings."
,,Really old and needs a lot of refurbishment,1.0,,"Cold and lots of concrete showing through everywhere, with water dripping around you. Needs to have a make over"
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Amazing rain forest inside a huge dome. About 5 or 6 levels to explore you could spend almost all day in here and still not see everything.
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"Could not believe the work that had gone into creating the cloud forest, it is so clever and the number of plants is a real eye opener....so many hidden gems amongst the moist air, something new around every corner, if you can't climb up there is always the lift so do t be put off!"
,,Interesting idea but...,3.0,,Idea of cloud forest is interesting but for me it wasn't worth spending money there. Lots of people walking there but plants are really beautiful.
,,Beautifully designed,5.0,,This is a must visit place for first timers. If you will compare it with Flower dome then you will find flower dome to be more picturesque.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was certainly worth the time taken to get there. If you love exotic flowers then this is deffinately up your street. The only drawback I can see was that my husband did not like the open mesh walkways as he got higher and higher in the structure so if you suffer with vertigo bear this in mind. There are lifts to get from floor to floor.
,,A must,5.0,,The architecture and the experience of walking in a colorful and well organized place will be in your thoughts for a long time.
,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,"Don't miss the Cloud Forest in Gardens by the Bay. Spectacular. Plants from dense, high mountain forests growing on a tall, mist covered, cone shaped building is enchanting to walk around, up to and in. On one level there is a thoughtful history of where we have arrived today with Climate Change. As an Australian it would be wonderful for many of our politicians to visit this display and see what has and is happening and realise what ideas could help our future. Brilliantly done, Singapore and the people responsible."
,,A must visit as part of Garden's by the Bay,4.0,,"My wife and I have recently returned from our first holiday in Singapore.

Before we left home, friends told us that a must visit is Gardens by the Bay which include the Cloud Forest.

We visited Gardens by the bay late afternoon and entered the Cloud Forest at about 7.30pm. The waterfall cascading from the top of Cloud Forest is beautiful but be careful as you will get some spray on you as you walk past it on the bottom level. The plants are beautiful being enclosed in a humid environment. This attraction is certainly popular with tourists and I have to agree with my friends, a must visit as part of your Gardens by the Bay visit."
,,Too many people,3.0,,It is a really good place for those who are tired of humid and hot weather of Singapore. The venue is really helpful for cooling you down but too many people were there when I visited last week even it was not a weekend and holidays.
,,So cool!,4.0,,"Loved this! The waterfall was only one part of this amazing place, the plants, flowers and even views of the city were lovely"
,,Misty walk among rich foliage,5.0,,"You can spend an hour walking to the 6th floor ""Lost World"" exhibit and back down, or take the elevator. The misty walkways feels like walking among clouds."
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"Visited the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and both were spectacular! Well worth the entry fee. Be prepared for some walking. If you love plants, nature and waterfalls, allow yourself at least 3 - 4 hours to get a good look through both domes. We did not have enough time to wander through the gardens but you would probably need the best part of a day."
,,Extraordinary display of flora!,5.0,,"The Flora displays were exceptional, but so to were the stalactites and stalagmites located on another level. The walk through the clouds was breathtaking."
,,"Wonderful natural beauty of rain forest, without so many insects",4.0,,"This is a great place to visit and takes a couple of hours slow pace walk. Quite a lot of incline and steps but they do have elevators so no problem. It is unusual not to have this jungle swarming with insects and birds but the noise would be defening if it was and you would get bitten to death. As it is you don5 need to worry about that here , it is a very controlled environment."
,,What a place!,5.0,,"The only downside was the crowds but that's just a symptom of being a really amazing place to visit. If you're at Gardens by the Bay, you have to get a ticket to this. So worth it."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"Plants from all over the worlds. A nice clouding atmosphere inside. Lovely watery showers and watery smokes. The inside tour can take up to an hour and no place to eat inside so
better to eat before you enter the cloud forest. Lovely scenic views, get hold of a lovely camera to capture the moments."
,,A Must see in Singapore!,4.0,,"Very beautiful garden, well taken care of. Almost every corner is a perfect photo spot! A relaxing place in Singapore!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Take the lift to the top of the cloud forest then slowly take your time working your way back down to ground level. View the sights through the waterfall and all of the amazing plants and foliage. An attraction not to be missed if you are in Singapore
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Without words... Simply amazing - Cloud forest & the Flower dome. Can literally spend hours here with breathtaking moments and images all over. Families visiting - all smiling, active photographers :-)"
,,Fascinating Foliage and Rainforest type Ecosystem,5.0,,"Spent several hours here, Took hundreds of photos. This place is a feast for your senses. Climate controlled and very comfortable atmosphere. You will literally see plants here that don't exist anywhere else on the planet. We could have spent all day here. There is so much to see. The most amazing foliage, incredible art woven amongst the displays. A huge waterfall. Every where you look you find a feast for your eyes, nose and ears. Truly a wonderous place and not to be missed. A feat of engineering truly."
,,Cool setting in steamy Singapore,5.0,,"Escape the heat with a visit to the wonderful multi-level cloud forest, which is filled with rainforest and other plants, and waterfalls. The mist is activated at various times of the day, creating a cooling and mystical atmosphere. Lovely place!"
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"What a fantastic part of the Gardens by the Bay. Would return to visit this again, I just could not get enough of the carvings and plants."
,,family day out,5.0,,a must for anybody who visits singapore enjoyed byall 3 of us who visited stayed here for many hours seeing unbelievable sights many many pics taken
,,Awesome place,5.0,,The moment you enter the dome is you see a man made natural water fall the best ever surrounded by different plants flowers and in top you get into lost world where you see flowers made of Lego and small pond then each floor you get to see different things crystal mountain waterfall deck and many more it best place I ever visited definitely hard work pays well maintained plants must say it challenging to keep it maintain they have done it
,,A huge tropical greenhouse.,3.0,,"As a said it is a huge tropical greenhouse with waterfall included. An ideal place to visit for all lovers of tropical plants, many varieties of interesting plants to see."
,,FUN PLACE FOR KIDS,5.0,,The RAIN FOREST in the botanic garden of singapore is a fun place for kids because the water which is heating the ground the splashes comes into faces and it was a too much fun area for my kids
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Visited here on our honeymoon. Huge dome with fantastic plants. Good place to hide from the summer heat.
,,Interesting Experience - Worth a visit,4.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest in the evening, just as dusk was falling. This time is a great time to visit the Cloud Forest as the crowds are slightly less and you get to experience the Cloud Forest as the lighting turns on and the skies darken. Take the lift to the top of the Forest and make your way down the meandering walkways, taking in the views within the Cloud Forest and outside the glass dome. Its definitely worth a visit here just to see the beautiful flora on display and take in some educational insights. If you're afraid of heights then this attraction might be one to miss, although you could take the lift up and start at a lower floor (the top floor is the 6th floor)"
,,part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,this place is a horticulturists dream lush tropical plants on multi levels and if you time it right you will get to walk through the clouds
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"This is a unique experience. Once you get to the top of the mountain, you come down thru the middle with lots of info. The flowers are amazing"
,,Not what I expected,5.0,,"I expected this to be hot and humid seeing as it's a big glass building.....how wrong was I!

Nicely air conditioned and a welcome relief the the humidity of outside.

Have your photo taken in front of the waterfall and then take the lift to the top of the waterfall and walk down inbetween it.

Some lovely places to stop and take some lovely family photos amongst beautiful foliage."
,,"Amazing structure, and concept",5.0,,"Start at the top and work your way down, the Cloud Forst dome is amazing. Especially when you walk out onto the over hanging walk way. Some lovely orchids, plants, flowers, sculptures, stalagtite display. You do pay a small fee to enter, but well worth it. Its a lot cooler inside as well, a blessing. Also here, is located the worlds tallest indoor waterfall. We spent about an hour in total in here, but did not rush"
,,Great place,5.0,,Great place to see some beautiful plants and amazing orchids. The waterfall was wonderful too. Lots of various tropical plants there.
,,A beautiful place,5.0,,"We spent 45 mins walking through the Cloud Forest, as a slow comfortable pace. Absolutely stunning!!!"
,,A Wonderful experience.,5.0,,"A ""must see"" when in Singapore along with the Flower Dome next door. If this is the only thing you have time to see, then you will have great memories of an extraordinary complex to take home.. try and go early in the day then come back at night for a sensational combination of views. ( get the stamp pass so you can return without extra charge - same day)"
,,Amazing Place!,4.0,,"One needs to see how Singaporeans take care of nature, natural resources and conserve it as well.
Adult ticket for entry is Singapore 16$ with entry to single conservatory. Child is 11$ .
No restriction on time part you may spend as much as time u like. Beautifully done up with flowers. An actual rain forest experience."
,,Extremely well put together,5.0,,A good experience and a soothing place to visit. The model crocodile in one of the settings looks so real in pictures.
,,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PLACE TO VISIT, A MUST TO BE SEEN ONCE IN SINGAPORE !!!",5.0,,"I stayed 8 nights in Singapore in May 2018, sleeping 6 nights in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and 2 nights in Mandarin Oriental Hotel. I visited Cloud Forest on 2 occasions. It was just a pure pleasure for the eyes and for the brain !!! It is really beautiful, relaxing, fresh, nice, unusual and done with love and care by incredible people. Once you enter the place, you will see this amazing cascade of water falling right in front of your eyes. Try to make a photo, but expect people all around and this non stop... Unfortunately, this is not the place to make a meditation with yourself, as there will be a lot of other people trying to do the same thing at the same time... To avoid this, maybe try to come very early in the morning or very late in the evening. I will soon post some amazing photos which I took, so enjoy them.

otterboris"
,,Combine it with the Flower Dome!,5.0,,"You'll save on a ticket to both attractions... and they are both quite different, both inside & out! I suggest you visit on a weekday afternoon; fewer people and a great way to beat the afternoon heat / humidity. Also, be sure to get your hand / wrist stamped so you can visit again. The real draw card in Cloud Forest is the elevated walkway; stunning views through the glass panels as well as looking down on everything inside... not to worry; you don't have to walk up; they have lifts and guards to ensure people hop in lifts in an orderly manner. You'll be tempted to backtrack & experience the walkway a 2nd (3rd?) time... but no need to go against the one way traffic; just take the lift back up! If by chance you don't know anything at all about the environment... you might be interested by the 'educational' film on your way out... but even school kids know more than they present... so keep going, get a wrist stamp, & do it all again!"
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,The cloud dome is must see thing to do in Singapore. Well presented and peaceful. Take your time to look around and enjoy the atmosphere.
,,Mesmarising,5.0,,Cloud forest was too good. The waterfall at the entrance is mesmarising. The kind of greenery and the way it is built its really great.
,,Excellent beauty spot.,5.0,,Wonderful spot for relaxation. I have no language to express about that place. I lost everything. I will visit again.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"From the drama of the waterfall as you enter to the well presented gardens and artworks,it was well worth the hours we spent there"
,,Very educational!!,4.0,,I went there and was awed by its beautiful infrastrature and magnificent creation. You will feel like literally you are going to a cloud forest. In addition to that there is an additional geographical info about mother earth that is very very educational. Highly recommending this travel!!
,,A Must do !!,5.0,,"Even if you are not a keen gardener this is an amazing place to visit. The cool and misty atmosphere makes a good contracts to the outside air.
You enter at the foot of the waterfall - spectacular, we marvelled at the planting and watched the gardeners at work as the abseiled down to plant and tend to the ferns."
,,This an amazing piece of architecture and is worthy of at least 3 hours viewing time.,5.0,,"Singapore has really hit the top of the list with this amazing concept. Ab it challenging if you have a fear of heights, but the experience is well worth while sucking up your fear and going withthe flow. Theforest in the clouds the water fall the tree top walk and the cloud walk were all different. The facility also provides education exposure to effects of climate change and the need for us to be more careful in our daily lives and ecological mismanagement. Singapores Keep it green has been extrapolated into the Garden by the Bay experience."
,,Entertaining for small kids,4.0,,We came here to avoid they rain outside. I really liked it and my kids were very impressed and happy to run around. Would recommend to bring a light jacket cause it is pretty cold
,,Must see,5.0,,"This place is a must to see when in Singapore. Waterfall looks great, also the mist is cool. And it is good temperature inside"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is a pretty amazing place mimicking an actual rainforest and it’s various levels. It’s easy to get around but be warned it’s cold inside. I was wishing I had taken a down body jacket and was quite happy to get out into the sultry Singapore air after a half an hour or so. Definitely worth the visit though.
,,Must visit once,4.0,,You get transported into a different world altogether. It is a one time must do for anyone visiting Singapore.
,,Definitely worth a trip!,5.0,,"We went early the the morning on Saturday where the crowds were mostly limited to tour groups. The setting and ambiance was very well done with plenty of exhibits and information. Do bring a sweater as it can get cold. There is plenty of walking and things to see. Families with small children would love it. Ideally, best suited for the mid-afternoons when you really need some cooling down or when it's pouring outside but I'm sure the crowds will be there also."
,,Felt like Pauly Shore in the movie Bio-dome,5.0,,Felt like I was Pauly Shore in Bio-dome! This place is worth the visit! Scary of you don't like walking on a pathway suspended 75 feet (estimate) in the air. But definitely check it out!
,,Put a mountain with waterfall in a room,5.0,,"The place is one dome in gardens by the bay. The idea here is to make an artificial tropical highland environment. If you went to cameron highlands then you'll recognize this place. Amazingly artificial waterfall and wind system creating clouds inside!
They did it near the equator! well done Singapore."
,,Wonderland,5.0,,It was an amazing experience. My children really enjoyed themselves. Best to book tickets online. But a do not miss attraction.
,,Nature,5.0,,Flowers and plants galore. The largest indoor waterfall greets you as you enter the realm of plants. Whereby the cool sprinkles of water droplets chill you. This place is fascinating for plant enthusiast and possesses à few specimens of plants that are extinct in the wild. A level of stalagmites and geostones harvested from various countries knowing that these are items are more than 10 times your age provides a feeling of grandeur. Highly recommended for a visit on a hot day as the indoor temperature will cool you and provide a perfect day.
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,Visited the Cloud Forest together with the Flower Dome and was blown away by how beautiful this installation is. The waterfall echoes throughout the space and the cooling temperature is an escape from the heat in Garden by the Bay. Walking down from the top was easy and the informational boards were simple to follow. An experience worth revisiting from time to time.
,,Really fun!,5.0,,"I saw lots of families, groups and solo travellers here, it was a really good experience and I'd say it would be a 'must see' for anyone going to Singapore. The feel was really nice and relaxing, and the information was all informative. Expect to take lots of photos here."
,,totally fantastic,5.0,,thoroughly enjoyed the experience cloud dome is an amazing sight. The waterfall is something to see .
,,Dome visit,5.0,,Booked on the spur of the moment. Very good if a bit crowded. Worth the visit and also nice and cool! Only downsides were very poor artificial rocks in places and loads of people.
,,Heavenly and yet focussed on saving our Planet,5.0,,"This Cloud is a paid activity but you can afford the $14 entry ( $28 for both Clouds ), to visit. This carefully created Forrest is full of award winning exhibits of all types of flowers / plants and the message of conservation is uniquely presented.

As you enter, you are greeted with a massive waterfall and you are primed to thoroughly enjoy this Paradise."
,,Just WoW,5.0,,"Cloude Forest is in the Gardens by the Bay. Gardens by the bay admission is free but Cloude forest has a entry fee. Firstly I confused to purchase ticket because gardens by the bay it self also very nice and the ticket price is quite expensive for me. But when I admit into the dome it was worth for my money. If I skip this it could be a big mistake.
The 35 miter long Fountain was create a heavenly environment and the hundreds of known-unknown plants make it a out of the world feelings. It was just great"
,,"A ""must visit"" if you go to Singapore!",5.0,,"This was such a unique experience, and sited in the biggest glass dome in the world. a 35m high man-made mountain, complete with waterfall and wonderful flora. It's in the park over by Marina Bay, and has a high circling walkway, from which you can look down on the waterfall, or out of the windows over the whole of the city. There are so many different areas inside, including a 'field' of stalagtites!"
,,Light show is amazing but entrance to the conservatories isn't worth it.,1.0,,"We had wanted to view the light show, so decided to arrive 2 hours early and use our City Sightseeing pass to go into the Conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Conservatory).

The conservatories weren't worth the money or the time.

We went into the Cloud Forest first, waiting 30 minutes to go inside (which we thought was a pretty good waiting time), only to find that when we got inside there was another hour and a half wait to go in the lift to the walkways. We would have missed the light show if we had waiting in line, so decided to just walk around the 'ground floor' which took a grand total of 7 minutes.

We then went into the Flower Conservatory which was fine, but the displays were being changed so most of the flowers/hanging baskets were just on the floor (yet we still paid full price!). Especially not worth it if you're English because you'll find most of the flowers in your garden (minus a palm tree or two).

Regardless, the light show was absolutely stunning and we would absolutely watch this again.

In short, save your money and just watch the free light show."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Do not miss this. It is just stunning. I cannot believe the variety of plants and the view looking down from the top. The waterfall. Brilliant!
,,Cloud 9 really,5.0,,"This man made air conditioned forest is an out of the world experience
There was great crowd but well disciplined
The giant waterfall first makes a great statement
Then we go around it to see the efforts taken to plan and develop this gigantic forest along with hundreds of species of types of plants
The lifts and the observation areas are too many and make for a great site
Ample of room for taking pictures and relaxing too"
,,Absolutely beautiful.,4.0,,"An amazing experience to be able to visit the beautiful cloud forest. It has an amazing 35mtr high waterfall, and lush vegetationand just so much more, a truly amazing place."
,,Good for Flower Lovers,4.0,,Cloud Forest is so magical! It will give us the moment to appreciate flower in the forest. The most amazing was the ability of the Singaporean to build this kind of eco attraction! Beautiful indeed!
,,"Woow, very impressive!",5.0,,We got here after we've been to the Flower Dome. Then is Cloud Forest a way more beautiful place if you ask me. They made it very good and beautiful. Really impressive to watch!
,,Beautiful scenery,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is located at Gardens by the bay. The one to watch out is the waterfall all under a glass dome and the misty environment. Along the pathway, there are beautiful flowers and trees. Kids will love this place."
,,Singapore Vacation 2018,5.0,,"This is unique place , located at Gardens by the bay. strongly recommended. here you can find the highest inside waterfall in the world and to have romantic between clouds walk."
,,Should visit place,5.0,,"When you are in Singapore, do not miss this, great place, there is water fall which is fascinating, there are walk ways and you can have breathtaking view from the skywalk"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"A must-do! The kids and us loved the waterfalls and the canopy walk. Spectacular flowers, plants and woodcraft. Really worth a visit."
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,The cloud forest is housed inside Garden By the Bay. The entry to the Gardens is free but you have to pay see the Cloud forest and Flower Dome which are next to each other. We got the combo ticket which was $28 for adults and $15 for children and another $8 for all day tram rides which could come in handy if you plan to see the rest of the Gardens otherwise you can skip that and just stroll to the Cloud forest. It’s a unique experience it’s housed inside a giant glass structure weather controlled which really helps on hot days. There is an artificial waterfall and all sorts of plants from all around the world the kids I guess really didn’t have much fun but they loved the waterfall. A lot of tourists it gets really crowded but it was fun exploring all the levels.
,,Breath taking place 😲,5.0,,Simply awesome 😎 this is a must see if in Singapore. It’s breath taking and man made. Take your time and take it all in.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Part of the gardens by the bay. Well worth paying to go in the domes they are amazing. The height is amazing with a wall of flowers and greenery. Gets quite warm so take a drink in with you and wear comfy footwear.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,The breathtakingly beautiful man made waterfall the tallest indoor one of its kind in the world welcomes you as you enter. You can actually feel the mist on you and makes for some excellent photos. The walk down the water fall let’s you see some of the amazing plants seen atop different levels of a mountain. The variety of beautiful flowers are equally mesmerising. The best place to be on a hot summer afternoon.
,,Wish I would have done other items at these gardens,5.0,,"You see beautiful gardens but cannot get rained out. I think the biggest plus is that everything is air conditioned. After getting rained out at the botanic gardens, I wished I would have stayed at Gardens by the Bay and done more than just the Cloud Forest. The orchids there were beautiful."
,,Head in the Clouds,4.0,,This attraction is an absolute must. The view is stunning from the top of the dome and the garden wall is just amazing
,,It´s spectacular place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,Cloud Forest dome it´s an spectacular place to visit and enjoy the nature inside a dome. With seven levels its a good close contact with different species from Tropical Forest until desert. The theater inside have a tridimensional screen with some documentaries of very good quality for any one in the family.
,,A must visit attraction,5.0,,"Cloud forest is located at Gardens by the bay which is a stone throw from the city area and also the all time favourite tourist spot, Marina Bay Sands. This place is also quite easily accessible by MRT ( Bay Front MRT ).

I highly recommend you all to visit this place in the afternoon because you are likely going to spend about 3-4 hours admiring the beautiful nature of the flora. This is the attraction where you can see flowers and plants from all over the world planted here in this little city of Singapore. There are many interesting species of plants you can find at this place.

There are also many great views inside this place, where visitors like us can take wonderful and memorable pictures inside. If you are a person who enjoys photography, well I want to say that, this place is really suitable for you!!!.

Inside this cloud forest, you can see the beautiful man-made waterfall which stands at a height of 5-stories tall. The climate inside this cloud forest is very cooling and relaxing. By the way, just to finish up this review, the last admission for cloud forest is at 8 pm. Tickets can be purchased at the counter nearby this attraction."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We visited this on a very hot day, and the climate inside was very cool, spectacular displays with indoor waterfall, and as high as it is it is wheelchair friendly, well worth a visit"
,,Awesome is the word,5.0,,This was amazing! Will make u feel cold in a sizzling hot weather. Great views and good walking trails. Dont forget to check out the mist timings at the entrance.
,,Worth the price,5.0,,"The cloud first is very fascinating and worth a visit, although it can get very busy. Much more interesting than the flower dome in my opinion!"
,,Perfect view from the top,5.0,,Visit Celavi at 57 floor mbs to see tge view... it was amazing .... This place so cute and nice for walk
,,Wow,5.0,,Part of Gardens By the bay..... Beautiful to say the least......The greenery makes you feel so good that it is almost therapeutic to go there... Highly recommended to spend money for this trip
,,Incredible!,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours wandering through this modern miracle. It's amazing what they have put together to amaze and educate us. The art work is tucked here and there and everywhere providing constant surprises and delight. The signs really helped us learn more about our world and the environmental danger it's in.

It cost us $14 each to visit the Cloud Forest and it's well worth it!

I highly recommend visiting here if you're in Singapore!"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"We did this as an organised tour which took in the flower dome and the cloud forest, a small meal then the sky park at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We loved the cloud forest and the cloud walk..... amazing"
,,An oasis in a tropical city,5.0,,"This place is huge, The plantings are opulent and breathtaking. It his cool so you might want to bring a light sweater or jacket. Plan to spend at least two hours."
,,Refreshing!,4.0,,The area is surprisingly cool for a greenhouse. Honestly me and my partner enjoyed the sights more than the plants they displayed. It is a good idea though to visit this place first before going to the Flower Dome. The souvenir shop at the exit does not disappoint!
,,Nice walk and lovely waterfall,4.0,,"It’s a nice walk inside and definitely a welcome cool retreat from the Singapore heat! There is an entry fee and the lines can get quite long to get in. The ticketing booth is about 50m away from the entrance so I did find it a bit confusing at first. There is a really big waterfall in the inclosure and you take an elevator up to the stop and walk down. Might be challenging if you’re scared of heights but I definitely recommend going for the walk if you can. This is a famous site in Singapore so I do recommend a stop if you can, be aware there will likely also be a lot of tourists."
,,Scenic!!,4.0,,I have clubbed my review of this place with Garden by the Bay and Flower dome. An awesome place to visit.
,,What a spot,5.0,,I have mentioned this in my review of Gardens by the Bay. My husband and I were over awed by the beauty of this place. Take a look. Amazing.Nothing like this in New Zealand.
,,Wonderful waterfall,5.0,,Wonderful waterfall. This is the 1st time I see an indoor waterfall. Cooling ambient too. Time to get some shine afterwards.
,,Superb!,5.0,,I was just as fascinated by the Cloud Dome as my kids were! so many interesting facts and so much to learn in a cool environment!
,,Beautiful space!,5.0,,Great way to spend a few hours. The whole space is beautifully done showcasing some of Singapore best flora. The entrance of the giant greenwall/waterfall is really impressive. The layourt is really well done as there is only 1 main path through so you dont miss anything. Also great views of Maria Bay Sands from inside.
,,Love this place,5.0,,One of the best places I have ever been to. A great place to experience the futuristic urban jungle feel. Absolutely fantastic plants and the atmosphere was surreal.
,,Amazing,5.0,,One of the best places I have ever been to. Absolutely fantastic plants and the atmosphere was surreal.
,,Must see,5.0,,Cloud Forest is easy accessible for both young and old and a must do when you are In Singapore. Bring your camera. The in general around Cloud Forest is a very nice park where you can spend and entire day. It’s worth the time and effort.
,,A great place to experience what its like to be in a real rainforest,5.0,,The place has been very well built to replicate the nature of a rainforest. The views from the top are stunning and the plants and waterfall are just majestic.
,,A lot to absorb,4.0,,"One of the two major Domes found at Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest explores the serenity, beauty and nature behind plant life and offers a memorable experience. With elements of the tour focusing on the sustainability of the planet, the walkway runs round a hugely impressive waterfall and the interior of the Dome is far cooler than one expects, offering a refreshing change to the humidity outside.

Every two hours, there is a Cloud Show, were mist descends around you, in parts completely obscuring the shrubs and plant life.

You are able to enter the Dome by purchasing access through a standard ticket. An hour and more could be spent here but the experience can easily be fulfilled in forty minutes. Worthwhile!"
,,Huge beautiful greenhouse!,5.0,,"The smells, the sounds and the atmosphere is absolutely brilliant! I’m not the biggest plant fan but this was so wonderful to see! The amount of effort that has gone into this place is unreal!
Be prepared for queues and also some people who try to jump the queue which is very annoying, to get up to the sky walk. If it happens just tell the staff and they are quick to throw the queue jumpers out.
Other then that issue it was just brilliant! The waterfall is amazing"
,,Nice one indeed,5.0,,It's worth paying for the tickets. Take 1-1:30 hours to closely observe the flowers and plants there.
,,A must,5.0,,"One of the top highlights of Singapore, absolutely a must and indoors so escape the humidity and enjoy the natural breeze."
,,Worth the entry fee,5.0,,This place took our breath away. I love gardening and this was worth the visit. Never seen anything like it and would go back again. Took so many photos.
,,Very impressive.,4.0,,This dome is very impressive and somewhat worth the entry fee. The dome is air conditioned so you can take your time and enjoy your visit. There is artificial mist and waterfalls. Escalators take you to the top of the dome where you can descend through the man made rain forest.
,,Amazing ....Amazing,5.0,,They named it the Lost world & it is certainty true........... Amazing and a must visit place at Singapore...
,,Visited the mountains and plants,5.0,,"Plants found in high elevations are planted in a man made mountain forest of trees, flowering plants and exotic species. Its worth visiting the only one of its kind and very well constructed to the highest specifications, thanks to the founding father of Singapore. Its great on a warm day to visit."
,,Superb conservatory for plant life,5.0,,"An awesome Utopia of greenery and wonderful plants. The waterfall as soon as you enter is awesome and the pathway is great to get up close and see some wonderful plants.

There is a waterfall lookout which gives you amazing views of the entire cloud forest.

great way to spend a few hours."
,,You MUST do this.,5.0,,"My wife and I set aside a couple of hours to do this, with plans for something different in the afternoon. We ended up spending 5 hours at this amazing place - and we are not gardening enthusiasts or the like. This is just such an amazing place, enthralling and worth every moment you spend here."
,,Cloud forest at it's best (Man made),5.0,,"If you're in Singapore shouldn't miss this place . It helps you too cool off from heat and humidity outside. Get to enjoy a man made waterfall and different kinds of plants and flowers which typically seem in cloud forests are there. It is an awesome sight. Wish I could add some good pictures, but exceed the MB requirements for a 4k camera"
,,Waterfall is the best part,4.0,,"I’m looking at this from a younger perspective, plants were nice but singapore had set such a precedent that I think from the inside it didn’t look as nice as the outside. Would still fully recommend you go, but lower the expectations a bit if you’re looking for something ‘cool’. Plants and waterfall were very pretty."
,,Indoor garden with waterfall,5.0,,"Best garden with waterfall, very cold inside. There are cloud in certain times, you can go to level 6 to see around the garden."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Stunning venue which shows all of its exhibits in a beautiful way. Fantastic building! Take your time and enjoy the site, then go next door to breathtaking assembly of flowers, cacti etc."
,,Expensive and Exotic,4.0,,Waterfall was highly overrated but the other rainforest like atmosphere was quite good. They do charge a bomb for entry.
,,Must visit in Singapore!,5.0,,"So many interesting plants, flowers which you can not find them together in anywhere else. Nice structure and architecture, like you walking in a snail shell and from the rooftop the views are awesome, but careful if you're afraid of height."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One of the highlights of our trip! The views are spectacular, and it is a nice cool break from the 100 degree weather outside."
,,Amazing mind blowing display,5.0,,A journey with surprises on every level and an environmental message at the end . Escape the heat and enjoy this amazing structure .
,,very very cold,5.0,,"huge place lots and lots to walk, family with kids think twice. or take a fast exist after few pics. buts its beautiful"
,,Great attraction,5.0,,We loved this and could easily kill an hour or two in here. The waterfall is beautiful and it’s a great attraction for all ages and visitor. Wonderful way to escape the heat.
,,Amazing indoor mountain,5.0,,The first amazing moment is as you walk through the entrance to be greeted by the biggest artificial indoor waterfall in the world. After taking pictures of that you move on to stunning orchid displays. Take the lift to the top of the mountain. Stnning news across the city and harbour. Then walk down viewing the different types of plant found at different heights above sea level. Don't miss the educational sections near the bottom. As a retired teacher I found the big screen cinema presentation on global warming one of the best explanations I have come across. The cloud forest is well worth the entrance fee.
,,Fantastic. Worth the visit.,5.0,,We saw this along with the other nearby attractions. This as an excellent venue to visit and we easily idled away a few hours of exploring. Highly recommended.
,,Best Indor Forest in the City,5.0,,"I many times visit to Marina Cloud Forest. It was so beautiful inside, like you are in the real forest with beautiful waterfall. They made 'haze scenery' on my last visit in December. Like rainforest in real."
,,Spectacular,4.0,,This was my favourite place to visit in Singapore. The waterfall is awesome and the plant life amazing
,,"Absolutely fantastic, worth the trip,",5.0,,We were glad that we paid a visit to gardens by the bay. Well worth the trip and the walkway in the roof of the Cloud Forest was great.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Really beautiful, lots of flowers and greenery. However, there isn’t really much to do and it doesn’t take long to see the whole thing. It’s very cool inside which is a nice break from the outside heat."
,,Very well done,5.0,,Loved it but actually preferred the Flower Dome. The walkway was great though - great views. Worth a visit and nice and cool.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest dome is wonderful. The top floor and waterfalls are amazing. The skywalk is a must. We spent about two hours at the dome. The dome is air conditioned. The staff is friendly and helpful. The place is well organized, nice, and clean. We paid $28 for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. We also paid $3 for shuttle services."
,,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!,5.0,,We visited both of the domes at Gardens by the Bay - and the Cloud Forest was my favourite and in my opinion far superior to the Flower Dome. The waterfall as you enter is stunning and the array of plants throughout is incredible. If you only have time to visit one of the domes - this is the one not to miss!
,,Spectacular display of diverse plants,4.0,,It took us about half an hour to walk around but there were extra displays / films etc which we did not bother with.
,,Impressed,5.0,,"Just one word: beautiful Love the collection of begonia, orchid, fern etc. Refreshing visit with easy access even for us, a family with young children and stroller"
,,I love that Cloud ☁️ Forest 🌳,5.0,,"First you have to buy a ticket about 16 Singapore Dollars 💵, very nice place to see a lot of plants 🌱"
,,nice chill waterfall and aircon,5.0,,"when walking in, the air mist by the fall will blow u away as you walk closer. take pic and feel the water. air con is prefer for tropical country, even as local I visited no less then 3 time"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Even though you are effectively in a greenhouse, this dome offers a lovely respite from the hot, humid air of Singapore. Beautifully laid out and the walk around and down from the top of the Cloud Forest is lovely. Recommended!"
,,Amazing light and sound,5.0,,"We had googled attractions in Singapore and as keen photographers knew that this was one of the top things we wanted to see during our brief visit. We went in the evening because we were there on business but it turns out that because of the light show this was the best time. Advise is that the show is best viewed lying on the ground which hundreds of people were doing but we found ourselves still on the walkway when the light show started. This was very lucky and allowed us some quite spectacular views. The super trees are amazing and beautifully appointed. It is a must do attraction, the walkway is very good value at only 8 dollars each and there is no charge for getting into the park below the trees to view the light show, amazing. I can’t imagine anyone not enjoying this. A truly unique experience."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"We have previously visited Gardens by the Bay but each time the Cloud Forest had been closed. It was worth the wait! The collection of orchids, ferns and tropical rain forest plants was stunning, as was the waterfall. Congratulations, you have done a wonderful job with this display. Highly recommended by us."
,,An Inside Waterfall,5.0,,"Amazing. Climb up, in and around this structure to different levels getting different views of the Falls and flowers."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"It’s beautiful, imaginative and it’s different from anything we’ve seen before. And if that weren’t enough, it’s delightfully cool, a great place to escape Singapore’s heat! Loved the walkways above it all surrounded by beautiful plants and great views. It reminded us of something you might find in Disneyworld. Very well done."
,,Beautiful. Must not miss while in Singapore,5.0,,"We went into this conservatory with no expectations and was amused and wow'ed by their attraction. The waterfall was beautiful and we were able to be inside during the misting time. It's very cool inside and there are a lot of interesting flowers and plants to see. My husband is not into flowers and plants, but he found the place beautiful. The walkways are a little daunting at first, especially those who are scared of heights, but it's worth walking around."
,,Misty,5.0,,A beautiful environment of mist is created here by artifical sprinklers. Also witness the world's tallest artificial waterfall here.
,,Heaven and Earth together......,5.0,,"One of the best gardens I have visited, the Tulip Garden was amazing and was nicely maintained.... It was one of the memorable visits to the Gardens by the Bay"
,,Another ‘jewel’ of Singapore,5.0,,"At the risk of echoing the majority, this wonderful man made wonder of the world is another must-see. We enjoyed this with all the attractions at Gardens by the Bay, including the fabulous light show in the evening.
Just a hint; don’t plan on a quick taxi ride home, another 200 people have the same idea . Take the MRT back to your hotel."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,This another not to be missed segment of Gardensby the Bay area. They organized in such a way you will amazing to see such beauty in the cloud forest. There is a lot of things you can learn about the environment.
,,awesome,5.0,,very very nice place. Bring your children for making them love the world. It is very good for making them aware how we are destroying the nature and changing the climate.
,,Beautiful but not much to see,3.0,,Cloud forest is one of the two domes in garden by the bay. It has one big water fall with Greenery around.there is nothing much to see in tht dome

,,Experience the the real planet Earth,5.0,,Awesome awesome experience. So much nature with proper channel way to show the same. It does has a fare which looks minimal when you actually see it
,,Rainy forest experience to be soaked in,4.0,,"Cloud forest is to be done as a part of tour consisting of gardens by the bay ,moonlight show ,marina shoppes ,marina bay walk along and cloud forest
All the above can easily be covered on the same evening if you start by 4 pm
The best part is the artificially created waterfall at the start ,kids love the wet n wild experience
The manmade bridges in the sky are really spectacular ,the artificially created mist adds to the effect and the flora and fauna give you the feel of a rain forest
The upper levels give a splendid view of the bay ,marina hotel, Singapore flyer
The stallactites on your way down are beautiful and not to be missed
Multiple levels you can take beautiful pictures and selfies
Spend time at each level and soak in the spirit of the place
Takes about 45 minutes to an hour to breeze through
Souvenir shop on your way out
Ice cream shop is a must visit for the kids, red velvet and caramel popcorn stand out .."
,,Impressive but . . .,3.0,,"The dome, waterfall, skywalk and collection of plants are all pretty impressive, but I could not shake the feeling that a lot of it was artificial."
,,Absolute must visit,5.0,,A must visit place in Singapore Wonderful experience So well planned Unbelievable imagination and fantastic layout Full of water falls amazing array of plants Highly recommended And convenient as side by side to gardens by the bay
,,Beautiful garden but very crowded with too many selfies,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest structure itself is architecturally interesting. The plants and displays are very attractive. I was here late in the afternoon and it was still crowded. Not so much that you couldn't enjoy the flowers, but I couldn't walk a few meters without getting in the way of someone's photograph or selfie.

You can get tickets in advance for a discount (save about $5) and avoid the lines. I just opened up the e-ticket on my mobile phone, and they were able to scan me in at entrance.

The lifts and ramps make this accessible to those with disabilities and children in prams."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Try and time it right so you see the misting as it adds to the experience it will cost you extra when you visit gardens of the bay but cheaper when you pair with the flower Dome
,,Fascinating!!!,5.0,,Fascinating place with some wonderful concepts of cloud forest.The cool breeze around the place will not let ur heart come out of it.Amazing place to visit.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Really lovely and so magical it's a thought provoking place and when we were there had amazing tulip displays I guess they change with seasons very clever structure as well. Defiantly worth a visit

,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Loved this conservatory with amazing architecture and engineering, and beautiful plantings of exquisite plants.

,,Amazing,5.0,,What an amazing area. Walk thru the opening doors and wham! it hits all the sensory organs. Just an awesome area.
,,Everything amazing,5.0,,Amazing as well. The falls which is the highlight of the cloud dome is breathtaking. The tour to the top is a must visit.

,,AN OUTER BODY EXPERIENCE,5.0,,Difficult to put into words. Its surreal the size and scale and the variety and difference - you must go you won't regret it.
,,Pretty Spectacular!!,5.0,,This was quite an experience to walk through this exhibit and experience all the forest. It was extremely busy and the lines can get long to wait your turn to go through it. It is worth it doing!!
,,Wow experience,5.0,,This is unlike anything i have ever seen. Outstandingly beautiful and well worth exploring every aspect. Not only that it is delightfully cool in hot Singapore
,,Man made wodner,4.0,,"I felt a bit silly posing for photographs beside this 'Artificial' waterfall but was once again impressed by the amazing structure and technology. However for me, nothing compares to the natural. After being to Iguazu Falls... this was a bit of a joke...:)"
,,fantastic orchids here,4.0,,This was lovely to visit very humid though but fantastic. Wasn't too crowded when we went on a Friday
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Simply Breathtaking. It's a testimony of what we can do with our creativity. A must if you are going to Singapore for the first time. Preferably visit it after dark for the full lit up glory of the place.
,,Majestic waterfall,5.0,,"The whole conservatory welcomes you with a huge waterfall at the entrance. Expect yourself 2 to 3 hours in Cloud Forest. Be sure to get your cameras ready. During peak hours or weekends, the lift inside to the top of the cloud forest might take around 15 mins depending on crowd. Once you are at the top, you can see the birds eye view of the cloud forest and some carnivorous plants."
,,In love with this place...,5.0,,Though its man made but I loved it. The water fall is huge and you can literally get wet even if you are standing far off. It's a tropical paradise. The walk from the top to the bottom was mesmerising. So many species of plants and flowers to look around. A must visit.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Cloud Forest is inside the Gardens by the bay premises and one must visit it if visiting Singapore. It is very huge and relaxing.
,,One of its kind!,5.0,,We love the AC in the domes in hot humid weather of singapore! Inside it's like a fairytale wonderland. It can be crowded. Love the waterfalls.
,,Unbelieveable Experience!!!,5.0,,"What an experience. We visited this attraction at dusk and the atmosphere was absolutely entrancing. As the day had been quite humid, we welcomed the coolness as we entered the dome. We took the elevator to the top and then came down walking through all the forest attractions. The crystal display at the top is definitely a must see. The beautiful waterfall is the highlight of the cloud forest, and most of the displays are spectacular. You almost get transported to another world. This was probably the highlight of my Singapore trip. Everything is so scenic. A must do attraction, and well worth the entrance fee."
,,"Nice waterfall, but otherwise a little over-hyped",4.0,,"I suspect we were spoiled by the more natural (meaning less touristy) attractions of Singapore Botanic Gardens and the truly amazing ""Tree Top Walk."" The Cloud Forest does have a beautiful (artificial) waterfall, and it IS worth seeing, but my advice is to also get out and see some of the less-traveled attractions Singapore has to offer."
,,This is the highlight of Gardens by the way,5.0,,"This is one of the two cooled conservatories in Gardens by the bay. It is preferred to buy the tickets online as there can be a bug queue there for the same.

It houses a pretty big indoor waterfall which you see just when you enter. The cool breeze hits you and you might shiver due to cold as well, so be prepared for it.

It's walking distance from Bayfront MRT station, no hassle at all in reaching here.

Inside, you need to take the lift to go to the top of this structure, and then come down. You won't miss this, as there's only 1 way traffic here, pretty well managed unlike flower dome."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"That was the most beautiful ""garden"" I have ever seen. It's well organised as there is an elevator to get to the top and then come down walking and seeing the forest at our pace and take pictures. Totally worth the price."
,,All you need to know about Cloud forest,5.0,,"* To reach here you can get down at Bayfront station. From MRT it’s Hardly 300 meters away .
* To enter cloud forest you have to buy entry pass , you can buy one ticket with includes entry of both cloud and flower domes.
* Cloud forest has big water fall which looks very scenic , from ground floor you can take elevator to reach 6th floor. From 6th floor you have to take stairs to reach 7th floor. From there you can come down using walkway and cherish the beauty of the dome.
* It also has a crystal garden which displays different sizes of crystals.
* It takes minimum 1 hour to cover this dome entirely.
* You might feel cold in the dome as they keep very low temperature inside it."
,,Cool place,4.0,,I liked the elevated walkways and the cool temperature inside this conservatory. The presentation towards the end about climate change was very educational.
,,One of the best garden complexes anywhere in the world.,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are magnificent. Go there twice, once during the day to see it all and once at night to see the stunning light and music show among the ""Super Trees"". These artificial trees with dome shaped tops are all lit up at night and at times they do a magnificent show where the lighting in syncopated to the music. I think this takes place at 1915 hrs and 1945 hrs. Entry to the Gardens is free but you must pay to go into the Domes, which are both great value for money."
,,"Cool, no really, cool",4.0,,"Entering from the oppressive heat outside was really welcome Like the way you are directed to the top and then there is a route down. Some wonderful plantings, many photo opps. A bit worthy at the end"
,,It is amazing,5.0,,The vertical garden is a wow. It was so cleverly designed with so many plants living in harmony. It would be better if the inside of the structure is more informative.
,,"Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest",5.0,,"Amazing, loved it. Beautiful experience. So many wonderful displays and lovely plants. Such a lot of work to maintain it."
,,A great place...,5.0,,"I had read up about the cloud forest before I had arrived in Singapore and was eager to visit. It didn’t disappoint. The attraction is breathtaking, informative and interesting. I visited in the morning and it wasn’t too busy. There are some great photo opportunities and its location is in a great place and within striking distance of other attractions.
The inside of the cloud forest is much cooler than you’d perhaps expect. It’s by no means cold but not as hot and humid as I had anticipated it was going to be."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited the Cloud Forest after the Flowers Dome. It is spectacular. A definite must see while in Singapore.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The orchids on display are beautiful,my son was very exicted to actually see the Pitcher plant on display in its natiral surrounding,the waterfall is also superb,the presence of lifts ,escalators and walkways make it suitable for all age groups."
,,Impressive,4.0,,Spectacular. Not the best if your are a bit funny with heights but well worth a visit. LEGO garden was pretty cool in geeky kind of way
,,"Green, green, everywhere!",5.0,,"Another really cool place to visit in Singapore, this is yet another stunning example of how green this city is, and how important nature and greenery is to the sustainability and environment of the country. Inside the biodome you'll explore the coolest plants, massive waterfalls, gorgeous botanical designs and more. Lots of people there so be prepared for crowds, and plenty of kids, but this is definitely a place to explore. Like the supertrees, I've never really seen anything like this."
,,The best attraction in Gardens b the Bay,5.0,,"If you only have time for an attraction in Gardens by the Bay, do not hesitate, this is it! is the best of all. Impressive waterfall, the environment really surrounds you in the forest."
,,A mountain of green,5.0,,The cloud forest is simply stunning with 6 floors inside this framework that is covered in so much greenery and waterfalls cascade down the side of it. The paths weave in and out of the mountain giving so many different vistas. If you like parks and wildlife then this is a must see
,,Easily one of the coolest places in Singapore,5.0,,"Great place to escape the heat and enjoy the unreal arrangement of plants. Singapore has no mountains so they built their own, with a waterfall too. Hard to even call this a garden..."
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,The cloud forest is amazing and very well done. Make your way to the top and enjoy the views of Singapore. Keep a lookout for online discounts
,,Cloud Forrest,5.0,,"Well worth visiting and experiencing. Humidity curls your hair, but the things you will see are unforgettable."

,,Interesting and chilly,5.0,,Really enjoyed this place (perhaps less so than the other one). It is quite cool in here so have a jumper with you.
,,Pretty cold inside,5.0,,This place can get pretty cold inside so bring a light jacket. Wear some comfortable shoes. The dome is just beside the Flower Dome.
,,walk around look around,4.0,,a nice place to go name cloud forest with lots of plant inside also has a big water fall cold inside nice view from top of the man made hill walk down the hill from the walkway and look around the city nice view
,,Very Impressive. Take a jumper!,4.0,,"Very impressive collection of plants from different habitats all over the world and the world’s largest artificial waterfall is amazing. It’s a pity that there was no fauna integrated as well as it probably make it a bit more complete. The temperature inside is much cooler than outside and rather pleasant but a light jumper would not be amiss. On the day we visited, one of the main escalators was inoperative which meant there were long lines for the lifts and staff would not allow use of the stairs just to go from Level 6 to 5."
,,Magnificent.,5.0,,"Don’t miss out on this experience, if you loveplants, do it. Very well organised, very safe. Something for everyone including children."
,,Amazing indoor cloud forest.,5.0,,"Very cleverly done this dome.The waterfall and different layers of plants. The suspended walkway I found a bit scary as I am not good with heights but I did do it, you have to !"
,,"Go, just go",5.0,,"This was our first time in Singapore and it was one pleasant surprise after another. We were able to purchase discount tickets at a shop in Chinatown. If you are a gardener at all, or just enjoy beautiful places, I think you will really enjoy a visit to the Cloud Forest. There are plants and flowers here from all over the world, displayed in such a beautiful way. Also, this is a great place to go to get in out of the Singapore heat, as it is very cool in here. I was so impressed!"
,,In the clouds,5.0,,Great experience to walk up into the clouds- need an umbrella to keep you dry. The variety of plants is astonishing!
,,Dont miss it,4.0,,"Had to be done while here on holiday in Singapore. We booked tickets online but as we visited mid week there was no queue anyway. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the huge waterfall and the temperature drops by about 10 degrees! Plants are all around you, they look great and smell divine. Great place for all ages."
,,Stunning. worlds highest indoor waterfall,5.0,,Fantastic. You get so see inside and outside of the worlds highest indoor waterfall. Absolutely stunning.
,,an escape off the heat,5.0,,You will enjoy the visit here especially under the hot sun.You can walk around on your own pace.The indoor forest is great and breathtaking.
,,Great attraction and great way to escape the heat,5.0,,"I very much enjoyed my visit to Cloud Forest, there was plenty to see and you could walk around as fast or slow paced as you wished. I like that it is modelled off real cloud forests in dense rainforest areas and has a good environmental message. It was lovely and cool in the Cloud Forest which was a welcome relief from Singapore's heat."
,,What a place !!!!,5.0,,It starts with a massive indoor waterfall complete with steam at certain times of the day lots of different levels right to the top of the dome a real feat of engineering visit you won't be disappointed
,,Fantastic attraction,5.0,,"This is a must see attraction for anyone visiting Singapore. If you go there you will not be disappointed, it is breathtaking."
,,So Much to See,4.0,,"Keep on eye out for ""misting time"" which is every two hours starting at 10am. This is the best time to be in cloud forest."
,,Epic display that lives on and on!,5.0,,"The minute we stepped in and saw the magical green wall with a waterfall I was happy that we decided to come here. Inside the dome is a bit chilly, due to the high altitude plants they grow here. We got used to it after we moved forward, but a scarf around my shoulders wouldn't hurt. The plants themselves were really nice and healthy looking, but the wooden sculptures really make you feel that this is one epic exhibition. On the top floor, I was surprised to see the Lego sculptures, as the plastic doesn't belong in this green dome.But I guess it was meant for everyone to connect to the inner child we all carry around. Another fun part was also on the other side of the Dume, where you get to see the city on the one side and the park on the other. I loved the experience and highly recommend it. More about Gardens By the Bay and Singapore you can read on our blog page, which goes by the same name."
,,WoW a Plant Lovers Paradise,5.0,,What an amazing place where plants thrive in the environment that has been created for them. There a hundreds of thousands of plants from all over the world within this glass structure. It is an expierience to walk and see the cascading waters of the water fall as they spray on the plants and outcrops. There is a walking platform or those that are not as nimble there is a lift which will take you to the upper reaches. A must see.
,,Beautiful plants and views,4.0,,But sometimes I wonder why I am taking the elevator to watch a waterfalls when there are so many beautiful waterfalls in the nature. But the rain forest plants still make it worth the visit.
,,Tiered tropical forest,5.0,,"One of the two conservatories within Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest welcomes you with a roof to floor length waterfalls. We were thrilled with the walkway several stories up which allowed us multi-tiered views of the forest at the center of the dome.
Prepare to get a bit wet and misted especially during the schduled mists enveloping the whole dome."
,,"Amazing achievement, will only grow",5.0,,"This fantastic exhibition is a delightful and easy walk. Only three years old, it's a brilliant exhibition already!
You are treated to exotic plants, waterfalls and stunning landscaping on an artificial mountain encased in glass.
Reasonably priced and a welcome respite from the Singapore climate year round."
,,Bay Gardens Singapore,5.0,,Apart from the gardens themselves the Cloud Forest was an amazing experience. Sloping boardwalks makes for easy walking as you transit from level to level.
,,This is amazing a must see if you are in Singapore,5.0,,"Air conditioned giant glass house, this is a real credit to the designers and the staff that maintain it. I would highly recommend this attraction for anytime of the year it is truly an experience."
,,Forest in the city,4.0,,Super refreshing feel when you enter. Cool manmade forest in the city. Definitely worth visiting especially on a rainy day!
,,Amazingly Singapore,4.0,,The whole concept and design was so state of the art and the uniqueness of it was truly Singaporean in every sense - pushing limits in creativity and technology bridging that with environment in such a limited space.
,,Superb,5.0,,"Do not miss this, its amazing! One of th highlights of our visit to Singapore and well woprth the entry fee."
,,A cool oasis in a very hot city,5.0,,"breath taking arrangements of plants, trees and flowers seen by walking around and up through the canopy walk. lovely and cool, when it was a hot 34 degrees outside with all manners of flora to be seen amidst spectacular settings - with an informative area about the threat of global warming and its potential impact to mankind in the coming decades"
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"An incredible set up that is simply breathtaking! The layout allows you to go exploring in a very relaxed manner, just absorbing the true beauty. Even though there must have been quite a crowd, it never felt like it due."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"Must do if you are in Singapore. This is well worth visiting, head to the top and walk down through the 'forest'. Make sure you experience the misting done at predetermined times throughout the day to get the full experience."
,,This Will Take Your Breath Away,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest remains one of my fondest tourist visits in Singapore. It seemed pricey at first until I entered the cool and misty dome and saw so much beauty it was astounding. The views of the city are worth it alone however I promise you will never forget the wood carvings, orchids, flora and fauna surrounding the walk way. I wanted to return on my last day because it was so special."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We visited in April 2018, and found the Cloud Forrest Dome to be the more interesting and exciting dome of the two. Fantastic views, very informative on top. Loved it!"
,,A highlight of the garden,5.0,,This was my favourite thing out of the entire garden. Beautiful plants everywhere and also a huge waterfall! The whole dome has a path that you follow to see different plants and flowers. Very well organised and really nice and cool inside.
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,"One of the “must see” things in Singapore. Beautiful, interesting, and worth it. Plan to spend time here .. Walk the gardens, eat at Satay I’m the Bay .."
,,Love the rainfall,5.0,,Walking into the cloud forest makes you feel as if you're in another planet. It's cool and full of thousands of plants from all over the world. A must see while in Singapore.
,,Just nice,3.0,,"It's nice but it left me somewhat disappointed, it's definitely expensive for what there is to see. There are many types of flowers there, including a section for award-winning orchids, but if you want to see orchids, definitely go Botanical Gardens, its cheaper and nicer. Beware of water vapor ... after 2 days of visiting I had the symptoms of stomach poisoning."
,,A different world,5.0,,Walking into the cloud forest immediately gives the feeling of leaving the hot & humid city of Singapore behind & stepping into a temperate forest. A good sight!
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"We visited as an older couple and found this an amazing place.
You are greeted by a six story waterfall as you enter and make your way to the top. The mist that happens every couple of hours makes it feel like you are in the clouds. If you dont go you will never know how beautiful itbis."
,,Good 2 hour tour,4.0,,"The price is reasonable,, the display is inventive since they want you to go to the top 1st and walk your day down through the displays.. worth doing."
,,Spectacle of technology and nature,5.0,,This forest inside a superdome is truly amazing especially with its ridiculous indoor waterfall. Overall this air conditioned glasshouse is a very pleasant and relaxing way to spend a few hours out of Singapore's humidity and heat with lots of photo opportunities.
,,Beautiful indoor garden,5.0,,Highly recommend buying a ticket for the cloud forest if you visit the gardens by the bay. This conservatory has an ~ 7 story structure inside loaded with plants from mountain forests around the globe. There is a impressive water fall as you enter. You then take an elevator to the top and slowly meander down some suspended walks to the bottom. Lovely place if you like plants and nature. It is also a great place to cool down after walking around the gardens outside.
,,A must-see! The future of sustainability!,5.0,,"One of the most impressive attractions I've seen so far. The cloud forest is a gigantic bio-dome that recreates the environment and climate of a mountaintop forest at sea level. As you walk in, you are greeted with a mesmerizing waterfall (also the worlds tallest indoor waterfall!). There is a walk way high above (35m) to give you a feel of ""walking in the clouds"". The plantfilled mountain is iconic as there are several plant species available to enjoy visually. It is a must see when visiting singapore plus it is definitely a nice break from the heat outside!"
,,Wow! Awestruck with the creation,5.0,,"A must visit place while you are in Singapore.it will definitely be your once in a lifetime moment.such a beautiful development.jusr Don’t forget to wear full sleeves and full dresses,as it is quite a chilled place with AC’s blowing out ice cold air.have fun and enjoy the scenic beauty of huge pink waterfall on enterance....!"
,,Wonder World of Plants!,4.0,,"Cool place, bit of walking but enjoyable. Throughout they try to create safe and future environment awareness among visitors, knowing statistics of how much our Mother Earth has been spoiled by human mistakes will surely make many to re-think and take one or two good steps personally towards better & safe environment.

Some photo spots and giant plants/flowers etc.

They stopped selling tickets to SkyWalk at 2pm due to windy and raining outside so we missed that experience.

Do NOT miss the light show (free show!) beneath the SkyWalk corridor at 7.45pm daily (just go to Super Tree area). There may be additional show at 8.45pm on Friday & Saturday, please check their website.

We planned to complete Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, Super Tree light Show and also the Water Show at Marina Bay area on the same day. Hence we entered Cloud Forest at 2pm, then finished Flower Dome, by that time it was around 7pm. went straight to 7.45pm Super tree show (not more than 30 mins show), then we had to walk (long walk 20-25 mins amidst crowd) straight to Marina Bay area (we need to cross the 'the Shoppes Mall' and then asked about the water laser show) for 8.45pm or 9pm show. We made it too:-)"
,,Spectacular man made waterfall,5.0,,"This was amazing walking among so many different plants. The sky walk within the Cloud Forest is worth it, even if you are a little scary of heights."

Don't miss it!,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is a cool-moist conservatory enclosing the world's tallest indoor waterfall at 35m.You take the lift to the top and descend through the mist-filled Cloud Walk, Treetop Walk and then through the Secret Garden. The whold facade is covered with all kinds of orchids, pitcher plants and ferns. The whole greenhouse is air-conditioned at a comfortable temperature, so you can explore and enjoy the flora and fauna in comfort. Highly recommended."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The waterfall is amazing. It is there as soon as you walk into the dome so it can be busy with crowds taking photographs. Apparently it’s the largest indoor waterfall in the world. It’s certainly worth taking the cloud walk as the views at the top are incredible and you get to see the waterfall at different angles on the way up. There are escalators and lifts if you do not wish to walk. The vegetation is topical sometimes the conditions were cool so a shawl or lightweight jacket could be recommend. The plants, trees and especially the orchids are stunning."
,,Beautiful high altitude tropical forest in the middle of the city,5.0,,"You are transported to another time and place when you visit this place. The architectural marvel that this is, it is amazing how the flora and fauna survive and the efforts gone behind building and maintaining. All the vegetation here is available on high altitude tropical forests like borneo."
,,Intriguing,5.0,,"This is excellent for all age groups and particularly those who have seen the film Avitar as it reminds you of this. Luscious plants and wonderful sounds of the rain forest, go all the way to the top and work down. I cannot believe how small an orchid can be!"

,,Mystical visit,4.0,,Like walking through a scene from Avatar. Can get quite cold in there and floor can be a little bit wet. Lots of stairs/elevator. The lift can take a while. It is pram friendly.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"I've been to the Cloud Forest at day time and at night time and this place is just as beautiful at either. Such a different experience each time. Great for kids - my 8 year old loved it. We spent about 2 hours here and there was just so much to look at. A great environmental impact video, recycling video display. A top place - love it and will visit it every time I go to Singapore."
,,Beautiful waterfall and environmental message,5.0,,You start off majestic waterfall and reach various levels of cloud forest.Finishing off with exhibition on climate change..Perhaps this presentation and exhibits can also be in other languages too.Perhaps percentage of fees can go towards climate change and survival of cloud forests so cloud forest isnt only places in future to see this
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,Put the Cloud Forest on your agenda for Singapore. It is an exceptional attraction and the flowers are absolutely gorgeous.
,,Amazing construction,4.0,,It is impressive and the waterfall is beautiful. Overpriced in my opinion but it is worth one visit once you are in Singapore.

,,Expensive but worth the time.,5.0,,Superb man made mini mountain in an environmental dome representing higher level so cooler than expected for tropical context.

The walk takes you down a pathway around the dome and mini mountain with lovely views inside and outside the dome.
,,Cloud Forest indeed,5.0,,"The place is cool and wonderful. Waterfalls, Orchids, Plants, Ferns. A relaxing place to walk around."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Do not visit the Gardens on the bay without visiting the cloud forest, it is an outstanding attraction. Whoever designed it has thought of everything, as you walk in you see a enormous waterfall and vertical plant displays that you walk through as you ascend through the cloud forest. It really is fantastic."
,,The probably future of humanity,4.0,,"This is a 'must-do' for any visitor to Singapore. We always take our guests here - even if they are not into gardens or plants. This dome is really remarkable and I think it how humanity may survive in the future. Plus, it's lovely and cool and the views of the city are great. Especially at night. Make sure you stay and watch the terrifying video at the end to be scared into helping planet earth"
,,Amazing.,5.0,,We have never experienced anything quite like this before. It was much more enjoyable than the adjacent flower dome.
,,Spectacular!,4.0,,"Second visit, and just as good as the first one. Always really busy, but so worth the challenges of people getting in your photos."
,,Amazing indoor forest,5.0,,"Breathtaking displays, along with the incredible waterfall. Really is a must see. Cameras and spectacles will steam up as you leave."

,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This is one thing in gardens by the bay which is a must do. You can miss the OCBC skywalk or the flower dome but this one is a must visit. It has so many different views of trees, waterfall etc and lots of picture points. The whole visit is soothing to the eyes.
Evening visit is better in my opinion."
,,indoor forest in the city.,5.0,,"awesome, chilling & cooling. what’s more, there’s even an indoor waterfalls inside. step inside this cloud forest & wander around. there are a lot of variety of plants to see here, you have to see it to believe it."

,,It s nice,4.0,,It s cool inside and requires fair bit of walk. It s a forest with waterfall. Best to come during day time as you can get a better photo. It s a good idea to visit in the wet day if you have nothing to do.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely loved this conservatory. The thought of the schematics of creating this place blows your mind. The first thing you see is a huge waterfall coming from the top of the huge vertical garden. There are walking trails going up and also lifts to go in. It truly looks like it has clouds at the top and the mist sprays are great too. The plants, ferns and flowers are truly beautiful. Get a combined ticket with the Flower Dome. We got 10% off at the ticketing booth because we flew Singapore Airlines. Gorgeous sight to see."
,,Favourite part of Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,We loved it in here and it was our highlight of the visit to Gardens by the Bay. Very refreshing in there and interesting to see the tallest indoor waterfall in the world! It was great to be able to walk to the top and you get a great view of the rest of the park.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"A must see if you visit Gardens by the Bay. Nice view from the top. Be sure to pack some warmer clothes, it can get chillier inside."
,,Cloud Forest @ Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"While the Gardens by the Bay in itself is a huge place, the highlight remains the cloud forest. They have literally creating an artificial forest with a waterfall around it. This is Must visit if you are at Gardens by the Bay."
,,"Absolutely amazing, but take a jacket!",5.0,,"I really wasn’t too sure what to expect coming here but I truly was astounded when I saw just how magical this was!

I felt like we were in the movie ‘Avatar’ there was so many stunning sculptures, the trees were so healthy and colourful.

My only advice to everyone is make sure you pack a jumper because it gets freezing in there!"

,,Worth a visit - breathtaking,5.0,,"This is a place you should definetly go to when in Singapore. I have never seen anything like this before and it is really fascinating. Make this a stop during the middle of the day because it really cools you down!
If you do not want to visit both, Cloud Forest and Botanic Garden, you can ask for a reduced price."
,,One in the world!,5.0,,Enormous compound that is air conditioned so extremely comfortable to walk around with family friends or couples. Well maintained and must visit venue

,,Fantastic Waterfall. Excellent botanical experience!,5.0,,Fun for all ages. Great experience for everyone. Temperature controlled for the plants and your comfort.
,,Unbelievable...,5.0,,"...of its beauty where human recreate a natural habitat for some many plants thriving together. It must also be a daunting task to tend to these plants hanging high above the ""Cloud Forest""."
,,A must see,5.0,,The best garden collection in Gardens by the Bay. The orchids were outstanding although look closely as most people just walked through without taking much notice and exploring. Great place for any plant/tree lover
,,Great concept,5.0,,"Had read much about this experience and were certainly not disappointed. We decided to catch the elevator up and walk down leisurely. There was quite a long queue but it moved quickly and we did have great views on the walk down.
Many excellent photo opportunities, although I am not a fan of people taking selfies and disrupting others! We were surprised to find that inside the dome the humidity was not high and interested to see the misting of the plants. Quite another world!
Would highly recommend a visit."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Believe it or not, it's so refreshing and relaxing to be in this place around midday. It was my second visit, but I was still in awe. My mom couldn't stop taking pictures - super instagrammable. The bridges were covered with mat - no direct view to lower levels from the small holes like it used to be - which means less frightening for those who are afraid of heights."
,,a bit of chills for tropics person..,5.0,,"Manmade indoor park, with waterfall features. Worth to visit if it's your first time to SG. you may get discounted tickets from travel agencies."
,,Avatar in real life,5.0,,This place is out of this world cool! It is a MUST see! We went in December so it was decorated for Christmas. If you are there during December so not miss it! It was simply magical.

,,Excellent Experience,5.0,,"This was just very good. A lift to the top of the facility and a good walk down, viewing the many exotic plants on the way. Not too hurried and very pleasant."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"This was a breathtaking experience that our entire family enjoyed. So much to see and experience, and the walk itself was great. Absolutely fantastic! We tried to go around lunch time to avoid the crowds, but were told that it is always fairly manageable"
,,Incredible,5.0,,My husband and I visited Cloud Forest recently after going to Gardens on the Bay which is close by. This is another truly amazing place to visit and you do wonder how long it took to plant all the different species of plants here and how they survive the magnificent waterfall. It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before and I would highly recommend a visit here.
,,The best if the Gradens bt the Bay,5.0,,How anyone has the ideas to build and create somethiing like this amazes me. A stunning disply of trees and plants seen from 7 floors.
,,amazing!,5.0,,Amazing work of art for this dome. We loved every bit of it. We conquered our fear even when walking the ramps. Definitely recommended place to go.
,,Refreshing,4.0,,Singapore is so hot but this attraction is refreshing. Upon entering the water fall is beautiful. You can see so many orchids and have a nice view of the park if the windows are clear.
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"It was a very good experience. A surprise at every turn. Got to see a new type of ginger called Singapore ginger, which was recently discovered, as well as some prize winning orchids. Lots of photo opportunities."
,,too much concrete...,3.0,,you may be better off if you travel over the border to Malaysia and take a hike in the Cameron Highlands
,,Really interesting,5.0,,Great way to spend an hour or so. Easy to get around with strollers. Interesting exhibition. Wish people would stop taking selfies with every single flower though.
,,A must see,5.0,,This garden is fantastic and a must see on any trip to Singapore. The water and mist is very refreshing. Lots of interesting plants and great vistas.
,,"Amazing Architecture, An escape from the heat",4.0,,"Though there is not much to do once you're inside, it was amazing to see man made structures such as this. The waterfall was not as great as I imagined but still is remarkable."
,,Tranquil,5.0,,Theres a beautiful zen like sense of calm in here. Its hard to believe that theres something like this in the heart of a city like Singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit. Especially if you are a plant lover. Suitable for all age groups. Other activities to do and see really close by.
,,After an initial wow! I was like...,4.0,,"How can this take my botanical experience to the next level?

As a proud Englishman I enjoy the great outdoors, and the occasional dandelion. But my mind soon wanders, and im contemplating other important things like could I make a rocket fly to the moon? And if confronted by a vicious dog could I perhaps befriend it before it bit me?

The same thing happened here. Whilst it's undeniably nice to look at, I couldn't help think this place could be improved if the staff would hurl water at you or throw confetti. Perhaps this is something the Singapore tourist board could mull over...

She enjoyed it, so that kept us from arguing for an hour or 2..."
,,Trees in the cloud,5.0,,Wow amazing who ever thought of such a brilliant experience. Really is stunning walking on the bridge especially when it’s the misting time. One tip is if you do this with kids there is a huge temp drop from outside to the forest so little ones may want an extra thin layer to avoid feeling cool.
,,Worth the effort,4.0,,"We visited yesterday and had a great time. We prebooked our tickets online which gave hassle free entry into the flower dome as well. We went in after lunch which we found was much quieter than the morning. No queues!

I was expecting it to be very hot and humid inside like a rainforest but it was surprisingly cool and very comfortable to walk around. You walk round the ground floor then need to queue for the lift to take you up to the top then you follow the walkway back down again. It was obvious from the long queue barriers that there can often be quite a wait here but we only waited about 5 mins, presumably because of the time of day. It is a great place which I think could be enjoyed by all ages.
Definitely worth a visit."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,An oasis. Very surprised at how well put together this attraction was. Loved the plant displays and setup.
,,An Orwellian experience,3.0,,"Having taken my 11 and 13-year-old boy and girl to visit, I was struck by a number of things: the first one, is the absolute masterpiece of both engineering and architecture that went into the creation of the domes. Nobody can deny that this is human ingenuity at its best. The flora specimens are astounding and truly representative of both the tropical and alpine / northern climates (each one is housed in the different dome). The water that is used to irrigate the plants various specimens, is all produced there, and a great deal of thought has been put into creating, designing and executing the two domes.

However, for me and my family there was a rather sinister and at the same time disappointing angle to this whole experience. Let me explain: As we walked through the different domes, you couldn’t help but notice for example Europeans being fascinated by tropical flora and Asians astounded by Northern European flowers such us an edelweiss or blue bells. Naturally, for each one of us, where we grew up is what we know, and that is what we consider ‘normal’. That we each bring our own paradigm or optic with which we view things is what makes the opportunity to look at different flora important. Yet, it’s rather tragic that we have to go to places like this to experience flora that is slowly becoming extinct, or that we can’t be bothered to take care of. Our family reflection was one of slight sadness thinking how dangerous it is that we are developing places like this where we “artificially” create these environments. More troubling however for me, was the fact that the Singaporean owners, make no reference about the importance of taking care of different flora, but simply flaunt how unique and amazing it is that “they” have been able to bring this into the domes. This is a hugely missed opportunity to educate our children about the importance of taking care of the environment in the world we live in. In a very typical Singaporean way, there is not a single ounce of reflection on this, no call for us to be better people, to consume less, to protect the environment etc. It is, as many things here in Singapore, simply another tourist attraction and another business opportunity!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Beautiful, stunning, amazing. The plants and flowers in the cloud forest are gorgeous and the entire structure is an engineering marvel. Not much else to say other than this is a must-see place in Singapore and try to go when it's not too busy. Easter Saturday was crazy."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful must see in Singapore although make sure the flower dome is open at the same time as we missed out and couldn’t come back.. takes a few hours to view and make sure you stay to take a few photos of the misting
,,A wonderful exhibit,5.0,,"Featuring a rain forest ""mountain"". Eveywhere you walk there are areas of great interest. We took the lift (elevator) to the top and walked down. Brilliant."
,,Beyond belief,5.0,,Wow this place is amazing so not miss it when you are re next in Singapore. The attention to detail is second to none and I could not fault it.
,,A lot of green and a lot of water,4.0,,Nice place built into a glass dome. Like going to the jungle without going to the jungle. Worth a visit as part of a trip to see the gardens by the bay
,,A must see!,5.0,,"If you are visiting Gardens by the Bay, you HAVE to do the cloud forest! It is so spectacular, with an amazing waterfall and incredible spiraling elevated walkways! It definitely has the wow factor!! If you only have time to do one of the two domes, i would choose this one!! I have never seen something so beautiful, educational and awe-inspiring!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The cloud forest was amazing, it is a huge structure covered in a vast array of vegetation and flowers. It has a walkway that starts from the top and leads you through and around the structure slowing you to take a look at all the plants and flowers. However, if you're afraid of heights, a word of caution, it is quite high up.
Also, if you look outside the dome, you can see otters sometimes by the shoreline."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Loved bringing my mum here. It's the kind of things you only see in Singapore, impressive, great experience !"
,,Unmissable in Singapore,5.0,,"To me, the Cloud Forest is the very best thing I saw in Singapore, which is known for its gardens. Iconic public art installations combined with an artificial waterfall and a display of the stone formations make it a special place.
There is a queue inside the dome to take the lift to the top level from which you can walk down. There is a warning for those who don't like heights to avoid walking on the walkway which rings the dome.
Best time to visit: Early morning on a weekday would be my recommendation. If that is not possible, try for the same time on a weekend but with a ticket bought in advance.
Skip the queue: Buy a ticket online (combined with the Flower Dome and skywalk) - depending on which website it has been bought from you will need to redeem it for a physical ticket. I bought mine online and needed to redeem it from the One Drive shop inside the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.
Once you exit the dome, you reach a common area which has a very nice gift shop - has something for almost all ages - plus a variety of eating joints."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"Literally has a breathtaking view especially when you go to the very top and see everything down below. For someone scared of heights, I was afraid to look down, but it was all worth it to see such a beautiful sight."
,,Incredible - highlight of our trip,5.0,,"Amazing! We’re not sure what to expect, the whole garden was incredible. Check out satay by the Bay too. Very close and awesome stay skewers. Great for whole family."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Amazing garden, I would have enjoyed more without my five year old boy however ! Went when first opened, easy to walk there from marina bay sands . Can get though quickly however."
,,Lost World,4.0,,"I did a general review for Gardens by the Bay. This is one attraction in it. It's worth going just for the surrealism plus you stay cool. These bontanical gardens are built up up and away. It's basically a giant wondrous greenhouse. You walk past the highest indoor waterfall and ride up the elevator to the 6th floor, then walk up 2 mire flights. From the top of the dome greenhouse you descend down the walkways including a Tree Top walk. This took me 30 min. but I felt I was rushing to get to the Supertrees Rhapsody show. I would allow 45ish. Photos don't do justice to the size of this garden. You feel like you could be in the Lost World."
,,Being part of the nature,5.0,,One of the most naturalist experience mankind created. It is expensive to get in but it is worth any penny. One of the 20 places to visit once in life
,,A day out to see tulips and cloud forest,5.0,,"Cloud forest is like a mini rainforest. Omce entered, you will be greeted by the beautiful waterfall. Its cool in the dome so its a perfect break from the ward sunny weather in Singapore. Lots of beautiful plants and flowers. Took a lift to the top and had a nice walk down to the exit at level 1."
,,Eco-edutainment,5.0,,"We toured the Cloud Forest as part of our entrance fee to Gardens by the Bay. It is several stories high, with different ecosystems at various levels. You take an elevator to the top, then walk circular ramps down. Lots of signs explaining what you're looking at and why it's important. There are also quite a few sculptures. A good reminder of why we should take better care of our environment."
,,What a magical place,4.0,,Certainly well worth the walk around. When they let the mist off it looks awesome amount the flowers etc. good easy walk Would certainly recommend
,,Unique attraction,5.0,,Not visited anything like this before. A relaxing walk around the attraction and added dimension when the mist is on. Timings published at the entrance. Worth visiting flower garden first.
,,"Caution, may get wet",5.0,,"If you visit the flower dome you may as well come here. They are both awesome and although one needs separate tickets, well worth the entry fee."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"This is a marvel in Gardens...where tropical hot house plants are seen with Alpine plants,and the climate changes as one travels from one to the other!!"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Must visit it if you are in Singapore. Beautiful and relaxing. Kids enjoyed it too (ages 16,12,8) Its air conditioned so very comfortable inside."
,,Must visit on a singapore trip,5.0,,"It was an amazing place, this is must visit on a Singapore trip. Will be good to visit the place during late evening, so that you can enjoy with day light as well as the artificial lights"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"We could not believe the architectural and horticultural excellence of this place, truly brilliant. Everywhere we looked there was something new and different to see. The orchids were so colourful and the driftwood animals were very different."
,,A must see,5.0,,Fantastic experince and although a little busy just take your time to walk through and enjoy as there are not many places like this in the world. We visited late in the afternoon and the lighting was excellent so would recommend wither late afternoon or evening to visit.
,,Astonishing,5.0,,"A great display, and truly amazing to see. And, a great message about climate change woven into the experience. A must see!"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,Worth a visit but a little pricey for the entrance fee. Great waterfall at the entrance. We went into escape a rain storm but did enjoy all the difference plants.
,,Amazing Creation,5.0,,"The visit to cloud forest with kids was such an enriching experience, as we learnt a lot about plants etc. Throughly enjoyed walking up the ramp around the cloud forest. Can't believe there is a waterfall here too !"
,,Waterfall,5.0,,We took a shuttle to the domes as it's a long walk. Opted for this over the flower dome as assumed this would be better. Waterfall was brilliant. Everything else was great. Must visit if you are in the gardens
,,Walking in a Cloud Forrest,5.0,,"What a beautiful and creative way to do a botanical garden. It has a 5 story waterfall that houses, elevators, walkways and theatre. It is a wonderful walk on a raised walkway to see so many beautiful plants and views from above.
Great way to spend a few hours and then you can also visit the Flower Dome and the rest of Gardens by the Bay."
,,Indoor Rain Forest,5.0,,"Did not know what to expect (hadn't read specific reviews I guess), but this was a surprise. You have to experience to appreciate. Expect some significant walking, vertically. If you have issues with heights, probably should admire from the lower levels."
,,Spectacular! A Must See,5.0,,"Unique garden, building, view experience. This is a stunning experience that you walk through at your own pace. Elevators take you to the top and then you walk down a spiraling path. Pictures cannot do it justice - from the displays, to the views."
,,Fascinating and beautiful experience,5.0,,"Quite an interesting, immersive educational experience. And nice cool well air conditioned break from Singapore’s oppressive heat and humidity!"
,,The better one of the domes...,4.0,,"In my opinion, this dome was better than the Flower some but that may have been due to the season we visited.
They were preparing the cherry blossoms on the flower dome which may have swayed my view, but the Cloud forest was much better. Walking in the heavens was unique and all of the plants and waterfall fantastic."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is the most amazing experience, and the best attraction in Singapore.
It's well worth the entry fee. The full-height waterfall cascading down rainforest-type foliage is very impressive, and all the plants and flowers are beautiful. We were there when the clouds of mist were released from hidden vents at the top of the greenery; it looked just like the Amazon rainforest. I'd go again."
,,Mesmerizing view,5.0,,Beautiful set up and lovely representation of of garden city SIngapore. A must place to go for tourist.
,,Unique experience!,5.0,,You are immediately transported from the minute you walk in to see the beautiful waterfall in front of the greenery. As you make your way around the forest you will see beautiful flowers. There was a bit of line to go up to the top but the line moves fast.
,,Magical,5.0,,"We were there right before Christmas, so there were special decorations, but it was beautiful, and I'm sure worth the trip any time of year. We went at night and the light shows were incredible."
,,Great Concept and Delight to watch,5.0,,Need to buy a ticket before entering but worth the money. Recommend to buy online tickets in advance for both Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome. Beautiful spots.
,,Must go,4.0,,A tropical climate in the big dome houses many plants that could only found in the Amazon area. Very impressive.
,,Typical tropical forest,3.0,,"This is more like a tropical forest in an airconditioned environment. Between the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, I would say spend more time at Flower Dome if you prefer flowers."
,,Wow,5.0,,This is a must - quite spectacular in every sense. Totally engaging even for an eleven year old. This is the future - vertical gardens. The walk way in the clouds is exactly as described. Magnificent architecture
,,Breathtaking! A forest inside a giant dome!,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a MUST visit palce in Singapore! Its a forest inside a giant dome! A beautiful, spectacular, breathtaking place with walkways, real plants/trees, a waterfall and many more."
,,"Definitely worth it, if you have time.",4.0,,Amazing display of flowers and plants and very educational. But you maybe already tired after viewing the flower dome.
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,This was our favourite of all the gardens we went into and it needs to be made clear that the use of a wheelchair if very accessible with both the user and pusher not missing out on anything. Instructions should be made clearer regarding disabled patrons not needing to queue. Staff were helpful and extremely friendly
,,Pictures and reviews don't do it justice,5.0,,"Cloud Forest. Gardens by the Bay. Supertree Grove. The photos and reviews you are looking at don't do these places justice, they are simply stunning and captivating. I will echo others, go early on weekday if at possible. Of these attractions, I will admit Cloud Forest quickly became most annoying for ""selfie stick interference."" I also cannot fault those visitors because it truly is something to capture and share with friends and family. If you can allow a hour visit, that should make the highlight reel of things to see in Cloud Forest. A majority of your time will be spent ""oooohhh and ahhhhh"" at the waterfall when you enter, and then walking about the skywalk.

For anyone hesitant about heights, please do not let any review dissuade you. Every reasonable effort has been made to make this attraction accessible to all, but to also keep you safe. I really admire the layout as anyone with physical disabilities can view this stunning forest. Ramps, elevators, vantage points for everyone, they have thought of it all.

Enjoy this amazing Cloud Forest, and remember to put down the camera for a few moments."
,,Great Artificial Forest,5.0,,Fantastic artificial forest where all kinds of real plants and flowers along with fantastically designed walkway from top to bottom. Must visit place in the Garden by the Bay.
,,Amazing display of plants,4.0,,Wonderful plant and tree life beautifully presented. The colours are amazing. Go early and avoid the annoying selfie sticks.
,,A great experience,5.0,,You have to take a lift to the top of the cloud forest to start your tour. Stunning views and a lovely indoor waterfalls. A large variety of flowers and plants.
,,Get over your fear of heights!,5.0,,"This dome really is beautiful and so cleverly set up. You ascend the structure via stairs, escalator and lift learning about the rain forest as you go. Near the top there is also a glass bottomed floor that you could walk out onto. You can truly only appreciate the detail and the scale of this dome in person"
,,mesmerizing,5.0,,"Astonishingly beautiful but freezing inside, take a jacket. The short film about our planet and conservation is really worth staying for towards the end"
,,Magical,5.0,,What a concept! The thinking that went in to this place was and is amazing. The results are a fantastic display and experience. Don’t miss this!
,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,Went after the flower dome at night. It was a good time to go as it wasnt packed. The mist/cloud apparently turns on hourly and we managed catch it. This made it look even more magical. Didnt spend too much time there but it was definitly worth seeing
,,The highlight of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Good value and well worth a visit. The water falls and arrangements with the walk way are just great.
,,Wonderful Gardens,5.0,,Worth the entrance fee. Most of the gardens by the bay are free but the two enclosed areas are not. But it’s well worth the fee to see all the different types of plants and the really huge waterfall.
,,Different levels of the forest,5.0,,Walking around the different levels of the cloud forest is indeed an educational and relaxing treat. There are different varieties of flora in the cloud forest. I appreciated the signs explaining the different plants.
,,What a stunning garden,5.0,,"The cloud forest is breathtaking, from the water fall to the walk viewing a climbing garden is like being in a seen from Jarasic Park"
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,This is a must see. very well thought out brilliant workmanship to put all this together when you go in first the whole dome is air conditioned so bring a jumper or a light jacket. waterfalls from the very top of the dome WOW is one word for it this meets you as you enter. plenty to look at hear takes about 2 hours you get an elevator to the top and work your way down through wonderful skywalks and platforms the 2 hours flys in recommend 100%
,,"Misty ""lost"" rainforest without trekking through jungle",5.0,,"This is a total pleasure to experience a ""lost"" rainforest without the threat of Anaconda pytons, leeches and insects!
Lifts, escalators and multiple level skywalks made it possible to see the wet rainforest and all the plants, including a big man made waterfall, all in the air-conditioned comfort under a BIG dome. WOW!
You can even admire the natural stalactites and stalagmites with large hanging mirrors to see them from all angles
The pitcher plants at aplenty, one wonders whether they are fed manually?"
,,Nice time,5.0,,"Between Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, 2nd is definitely way more impressive, orchids are just unbelievable! It's nice and cool inside, so great for spending hot midday hours. Very nice gift shop at the exit."
,,Cool,5.0,,"Part of the gardens by the bay. This is the indoor garden/forest. The flora is not as varied or unusual like the Dome, but the canopy walk is unique Probably the only one of its kind in the world as an attraction"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The ""Cloud Forest"" is a true marvel so allow yourself plenty of time to walk, look, listen and photograph [if that is your thing]. This is nor an experience to be rushed but rather to be savoured. So much to see and take in - a definite MUST!"
,,Cloud forest magic,5.0,,"Love Love Love it. Such a magical place and well maintained, glorious plants and well illustrated about their origins."
,,Lovely,5.0,,This garden is fully air conditioned so you don't end up feeling hot when exploring. The water fountain is the highlight which is very nice.
,,"Wonderful, educational experience!",5.0,,Private guides tour with Alexander of “Three Brothers Tours” was exceptional. Lots of wildlife spotted and explained with patience and great expertise. New and old growth forest was stunning and wonderfully preserved and accessible. Definitely recommend going with a guide.
,,Not To Be Missed,5.0,,"Definitley one of the best atractions in Singapore.
You should be there to understand.
The place is airconditioned (it was too cold for me. So take a light coat with you).
The first atraction is the Water-Fall. Dont skip it over.
Then you walks through levels of pure botanic pleasure.
Many kinds of plants includ Carnivorous plants.
The price is bit high if you come with all the family.... but it worth it."
,,Great Water Fall,5.0,,Must visit place to feel nature with great water fall. Feel nature and water fall top to bottom and bottom to top. It also have water fall view point. Also provide nature effects on our life and what can happen in future without trees and nature.
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"My family and I recently visited the Cloud Forest on a week day evening. From memory it was approximately $50 for a family of four (2 adults and 2 children), and well worth it. When first inside the cloud forest, you are greeted with a beautiful waterfall, lush gardens and the overhead lights from the upper levels. The gardens are well maintained, the flowers are beautiful and there are many statues and exhibits to look at as you make your way through. There are two levels above, which give you a full 360 degree view of the cloud forest and also boast incredible views of Singapore city. At the completion of the forest, there are some interactive educational displays and movies which were very well done and interesting. One important point to note - it is cold inside the cloud forest, I’d recommend taking a coat/jumper, especially for little ones. 5/5"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"It might look difficult to get a pram around, but the lifts take you to each level and the paths are easy to get around. It has some spectacular views of Singapore and you must come up here."
,,The Families Favourite,5.0,,Although the Super Trees get all the glory this place is definitely worth the admission fee. I don't think I've ever been somewhere quite as unique. As well as being beautiful it was also a great learning experience for the children. They came away knowing a lot more about the natural world.
,,Avatar (the movie) on earth- SO Gorgeous!!,5.0,,I felt like I was transported to a different universe. There were so many beautiful plants and nature - and the waterfall took it to the next level. The perfect destination to take visiting friends/ family or if you want to escape the big city.
,,Best representation of a cloud forest,5.0,,I wonder that singapore has created their cloud forest which is amazing to see . Its one of the best places where you can experience the flora and fauna
,,Must visit,5.0,,It is one of those man made beauties which will leave you speechless. It is meticulously planned and wonderfully maintained. Worth it
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"We like, but are not crazy about plants and flowers...but the is just amazing! We were lucky it was very quiet...no queues or crowds. Superbly planned and laid out with clear walkways at all levels, just fantastic views."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Beautiful park with an amazing waterfall and plenty to see. Worth going to as well as the garden. a bit of walking involved
,,A must see,5.0,,Definitely worth visiting here. Take lift to top and make your way down taking in the breathtaking scenery and wonderful plant life that is on offer. Largest indoor waterfall
,,Really beautiful,5.0,,"If you enjoy nature this is definitely the place for you! The waterfall is really beautiful, and there are so many other flowers to explore too.

Take a walk round the top of the waterfall and enjoy what Asian nature has to offer. Great way to pass an afternoon and escape the sun for a little while!"
,,It was the best rainfall experience I ever had.,5.0,,"It feels like you are literally in a cloud forest, and it also helps you analyze how important the nature is for us. It is a must visit place."
,,Must see,5.0,,"I was really excited to see this and it did not disappoint. It was simply breathtaking. We had fun walking around it, observing the structure and the beauty of the ""forest."" There were few people when we went there so it made the trip extra special."
,,Worth the Visit,4.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay Complex. If you do the first dome,make sure you have your hand stamped because the admission covers both. The waterfalls is very nice. The vegetation inside is spectacular as are the flowers. The walkways through the dome are spectacular as you go near the top. The exhibits are very well done and they are changed periodically. The short film on the environment is well worth watching. The Cloud Forest is cool so it is a big relief from the Singapore heat. Stay away from weekends, it gets very busy.. try and avoid the tour groups as well. Well worth the time if you are in the area."
,,Lessons in biodiversity and conservation,5.0,,"It is a huge space with controlled temperature, humidity and light where plants and flowers from tropical areas to hillside are grown and conserved. The 35 meter high transparent hump-like glass dome with silvery metal strips covers about one hectare ground space that has an indoor waterfall and multiple types of terrain where plants and flowers flourish. The incessant fall of flowing water results in a mist which adds to a cloudy dimension to the environment. The pathways are made carefully to give the visitors a wide exposure the flora and fauna. Special among the exhibits are miniature orchids and carnivorous plants."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is beautiful. The different types of plants and the artificially created waterfall are great. Though it is very humid and cold, so better bring a jacket."
,,Amazing fuse of architecture and nature,5.0,,"If you have been walking around Gardens by the Bay all day, Cloud Forest is quite a relief because its inside an airconditioned dome. Prepare for more walking as well. One of the highlights of this place, aside from the waterfall, is the wonderful view from the top of Cloud Forest while looking down. Lots of beautiful plants, rocks, exhibits. Not good for people afraid of heights, although there are railways to hold on to."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"We only had time for one dome so visited the cloud dome as heard this was the better of the two. Well, it was astounding. The huge waterfall that greets you is spectacular. It is very cool in there and we needed jumpers. There is a bit of walking but you can stop along the way. There is a lift to the top then you walk down. Worthwhile as doubt we will ever see something like this again."
,,an amazing experience,5.0,,"Don't miss this one. It is an amazing recreation of a cloud forest and is breathtaking. It can be easily toured in 1-2 hours, and is a cool respite from the Singapore heat. The outdoors portion of Gardens by the Bay is free and lit up at night, with light shows a couple of times each evening."
,,Nothing special in my opinion,3.0,,"This place just didn't grab me. It's an indoor man-made mountain with plenty of plants/flowers to see and I just didn't find it interesting.
It could be that my feet were sore and I just wanted to rest them, but it just felt like this fell far short of being worthwhile."
,,Worth a visit anyday,5.0,,"This place is just incredible, the design the layout just amazing that they have managed to get so many different plants together in one place."
,,the whole Garden by the bay is amazing - this is spectacular,5.0,,this is definitely one of the main attraction but also the light show in the evening and the floral dome are amazing
,,Worth the additional fees!,5.0,,"This is not free but if you're already at the Gardens by the bay, better visit this too, you can book using klook so you don't have to fall in line to buy ticket and will be much cheaper! Amazing place, kudos to all genius people behind this construction!"
,,Great to see,5.0,,Absolutely amazing view as you enter .. The waterfall is really very pleasing to the eyes .. Then you get to take a lift to the 6th floor .. and you journey downwards .. Different flowers & plants ..
,,What an experience,5.0,,I would never have the courage to climb a mountain to see this plant landscape so this gave me the easy way out. A must for all visitors to Singapore
,,Very beautiful Indoor Forest,4.0,,"This Indoor Forest was very beautiful. At the front gate, you will be mesmerized by the Waterfalls and along your trip from the top floor to down, you have to walk through the bridge pavement which is great. Don't worry, they don't have any animals or insect here. All of it was pure floral. But, don't forget to bring your jacket since it was very cold in here."
,,Lovely,5.0,,Its a magical forest. Everything in it is nice.Climbing it up to reach the top then watching the live show with the additional of the secret garden and the galleries was absolutly amazing.
,,A tip to view the misty effect in the forest,3.0,,Not really a great place to go but if you really want to enjoy and view the misty effect of the crowd forest. Drop by at 11am when they will spray mist to water the plant. That misty effect makes the place like you are in the cloud and that is why it is called the cloud forest.
,,Okay but busy,3.0,,Great visit but really busy at weekend but too be honest what do you expect I thought this was nicer than the flower dome but my personal opinion
,,A good day out.,4.0,,"Visited all the domes. They are wheelchair friendly makes bringing my mum in-law convinient. Its truly a place to experience the various flora. Take your time don't rush through, best to visit in afternoon and end in the evening when the lights come on. I've trekked the jungles and waterfalls of Malaysia and the experience of the misty forest is spot on."
,,"Yes, buy the add on ticket for the Domes",5.0,,Great experience. Time your visit for the misting periods... which makes it even more interesting. It looks a lot more walking than it is... there are many escalators available.
,,awesome forest in the middle of a busy city,5.0,,"this attraction is quite awesome. entry fee was SGD28 for two places (this and flower dome, per march 2018). i gotta say that the exhibition is flawless, coming from me that was born and raised in a village near an actual rainforest. definitely will visit again in near future with my kids"
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Great place to visit - a must see. Great exercise too. An amazing place to escape the heat and humidity of outside.

I have been here a couple of times and it just gets better every time!

A must see - well worth the admission price."
,,Sakura festival on,3.0,,"Went on a Easter Sunday weekend and the place was crowded with tourists.
The display of plants, cactus and bottle trees are the same as our last visit.
Only at the first level was the display of sakura trees and some stalls of Japan's goods were set up inside the function room. Some girls rented kimono and walked around taking photos in them.
Nothing exiting as this is not our first visit. Fortunately we've got discount using our senior passion cards."
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"For anyone whom loves/ adores plants/ flowers/ faunas/ . . Then, you should not miss this once in a lifetime visit. . Because, you will find a number of eye-catching flowers that will dazzle u. . Besides, the many types of plant species found here. . U can take a number of beautiful photos in here form with your loved ones. . Best time to go would be in the evening +_5pm., where the weather would be cooling inside . . The effort by the management to maintain/upkeep and the architect/ designer had done an excellent job. It had paid off as it has made it a memorable visit for all whom had come. . Hope u would enjoy the stroll thru this beautiful landscape as i had."
,,What a great experience,5.0,,"I have really enjoyed this. A great activity for all ages. Indoor, fully air-conditioned. Value of money."
,,Don’t miss this when you come to Singapore,5.0,,"My family visit Cloud Forest once a quarter whether we go on our own or with overseas visitors.
In hot and humid weather all year round, Cloud Forest is a ‘cool’ place where you can enjoy your walk and get to see nice flowers / trees and scenery (even though you can or compare to real water falls in other countries).
You will need about 1.5 hours to fully enjoy the whole place and you may bring a light jacket if you have young children with you."
,,Feel Asian highlands,5.0,,"A various kinds of unique plants and trees are arranged together with a huge water fall in a giant refrigerator.

The climate inside is quite similar to that of highlands in Malaysia of cool air and humidity. It would be a great combination if they keep wild animals here:)

If choosing one of the indoor gardens, you must go into this one."
,,Breath taking and imaginative presentation,5.0,,"The large waterfall which you go to the top off and wind your way down is imaginatively created and is a must se in Singapore. If you only have the time to visit one of the domes this is the one to choose. There are stunning plants and trees planted throughout including an orchid display stunningly put together, sculptures, art works, lego plants and the aerial walk are really impressive - but it is the waterfall that is the breathtaking feature of this of this attraction. beware you may also get wet when the exhibit mists up to keep the plants moist.The cloud forest also provides information on man's impact on the environment information and examples of stalactmites and stalactites . Please visit you won't regret your spending -just make sure you have given yourself enough time!"
,,A must,5.0,,Amidst the Gardens by the bay ..this done is a must visit...air conditioned so a relief in the tropical weather..refreshing walk and feeling amidst a forest in middle of a city..just visit for the efforts .magnitute and the thought behind it. One of the best attractions in Singapore
,,Cloud forest,3.0,,"It is an ok experience not much to see or do though, unless if you really love flowers. not many colouds as the name purports."
,,Worth to visit,5.0,,"A place housing man made waterfall, clouds and full of rain trees make it a must visit place. You may take lift to go at seventh floor and keep descending through a waking ramp and observing beauty of various trees."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"This is the best experience in Singapore. It is just eye popping everywhere you look. It is amazing to think they only built it in 2012. The combination of flowers, plants, sculptures and layout is just amazing. If you only have time for one attraction make sure you visit. This is better than the partner flower dome."
,,Impressive cloud forest,5.0,,Next to the Flower Dome. An impressive air conditioned structure with city views. Large indoor waterfall and interesting forest displays. Cost $28 entry for both domes and requires half a day.
,,Beautiful and breath taking... worth a visit,5.0,,"This place is just beautiful. The way it has been constructed and considered. The mix of waterfalls, stunning plants, amazing sculptures and art works. It is a great experience and well worth a visit. The cloud dome mists up every two hours at 10am 12pm etc. Just a pleasant way to spend an hour or two to appreciate the beauty, wonder and amazing complexity of how it was conceived and integrated. Loved it. Highly recommend going there."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"A must see on your visit to Singapore. Quite extraordinary. Massive waterfall...beautiful gardens, incredible timber sculptures. Don't miss this one! Heaven in Singapore!"
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,The moment you walk into cloud forest you'll be greeted by a man made giant waterfall and that will take your breath away. You will then ascend to the top of a man-made structure and then walk down slowly while enjoying the different type of plants and flowers along the way. Exciting!
,,Magical,5.0,,"This place is beautiful and well worth the time. The sky walk is not as scary as it looks. Don't get me wrong, if you are afraid of heights you will be scared but it is doable. Be there for the mist. You will see rare wood carvings, flowers, displays, that are impressive. I would love to visit this place again."
,,Amazing environment and views out to the city!,5.0,,"This is a well-engineered environment within the largest dome at Marina Bay. I felt it was well worth the cost. I took tons of pictures: scenery, flowers and views. The walk down is great and I found I was slower than most groups, so the people always changed. There is a lift up (and one down for anyone in a wheelchair where able-bodied take steps) and ramps down. There are exhibits about caves and the environment along the way down. The waterfall is amazing and you see it face on when you enter and then at different places as you walk down. Perfect place for pictures and to see some of the sights of Singapore. I loved it!"
,,One of the garden by the bay domes,5.0,,This being one of the garden by the bay domes there is a fee to enter which also includes the other Dome it is $28. We found this Dome to be the more interesting of the two domes. The Dome is air-conditioned which is a nice break from the heat of Singapore.
,,Impressive and educational,5.0,,This place is very impressive. The indoor waterfall is huge. It’s a nice place to wander around and cool off from the humidity of Singapore. The hard hitting message towards the end of the experience will resonate with many who visit (saving our planet).
,,Unique Attraction Worth the Visit,4.0,,"Our overall impression of the Cloud Forest was perhaps coloured by the fact that we visited on Good Friday and so there were thousands of people milling around trying to gain access in the sweltering heat and it was very congested inside. Strip that away and you have a hugely original and well-assembled attraction that constantly has you questioning ""how did they do that?"" The planting is magnificent and the many features keep interest levels high. We didn't so the audio tour but this might have been an good idea on a quieter day! You gradually work your way to the top with the exception of the lift from about a quarter of the way up which was a real bottleneck. Up escalators might have been the way to go to complement the down escalators which take you back to a basement where you watch an impressive big screen eco lesson. Watch out for the wonderful carvings from tree roots and driftwood and marvel at the amazing variety of exhibits below."
,,amazing,5.0,,I was very impress how is it possible to have a man made waterfall in a dome! nice to do when the weather is rainy outside.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"This is a wonderful place to visit. It is fully disabled friendly. The plants, shrubs and flowers are lovely and the orchids are wonderful. It is worth the price!"
,,"Beautiful, a trip highlight",5.0,,Costa extra to visit but you get your monies worth. We spent over an hour in there. It’s beautiful and really special to explore. Highly recommend
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,This is a must visit place. This is in gardens by the bay and its a popular tourist spot. The Water fall is mesmerizing.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful attraction.. Must visit for nature lovers...the place has lot of things to see and lots to walk..
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is very relaxing, it is a nice walk amongst flowers, plants, the view on top is very is very nice."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. Such an interesting place, it is a little cold inside so take a jacket. There is lots of information about all the plants and species, very well maintained!"
,,Definitely worth the visit.,5.0,,Waterfall was cool. We loved strolling around checking out the exhibits and seeing the plant life close up.
,,Great,5.0,,"Just great only can recommend this one of a art habitat - must see! A walk through exhibition like not many others. Great walk with many interesting plants, tries and flowers - great for families too!"
,,up close & personal,4.0,,"If you have never been into a REAL cloud forest or mossy forest, this was the next best alternative under a simulated enclosure.

It still cannot be compared to the real thing because it lacks an ecosystem. Other than plants, you would hardly find anything else. Excluding the tourists, no other living components of an ecosystem were present. It was like a zoo exhibit for plants.

Everything was controlled carefully and I would not be surprised by the cost of maintaining such an project, hence the high entrance fees."
,,The same greens all over - okayish compared to others,3.0,,"The cloud forest is a six storeyed forest - best seen in descending order! However, the greens are the same and often monotonous or un-engaging. The moment when enters the enclosure it feels awesome but later on it looks repetitive. For those who have fear of heights - this place can be uncomfortable."
,,Amazing!!!!,5.0,,"Dont be put off by the height of the Cloud forest,the lift takes you to the top and then it is a steady stroll down through all the diverse sections. The colours and plants are breathtaking and words cannot describe the waterfall, it just has to be seen"
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,"We really enjoyed walking around these gardens and found them to be well worth a visit. Having seen them on Blue Planet 2 it was really nice to see them ""live"" and the gardens will develop into an even more amazing park in years to come. Well recommended!"
,,Interesting green feature,4.0,,"The green covered RCC structured building with a water fall conveys a message to the people to think about green coverage over the regular brick and mortar life. It encourages plantation in roads, buildings, public places, restaurants and all the areas wherever we could place and maintain greenery."
,,A mind blowing exhibit with much deeper symbolism,5.0,,"Almost everyone who visits Singapore will see this and there are already 10,000 reviews here as a testament to a great attraction. I purely wanted to put my thoughts and impressions as rarely has a place or 'attraction' moved me to this extent. My expectation of Singapore was of a 'tech hub' some what akin to Tokyo, perhaps the Shinjuku district. Sterile, with sharp lines, neon impressive but perhaps a little soulless? This huge, internally unsupported greenhouse certainly has the clean lines reminiscent of a space craft. It also has such a magnificent, well cared for, unbelievebly complex planting it is totally mind blowing. The man hours it must take to maintain this must be vast. Somehow everything works as does the clear harmony between plants and buildings seen throughout Singapore. Perhaps a model for many other Cities. You don't have to be a botanist or a science geek to appreciate the artistry of this place or the symbolism. There is a statue of a child at the Singapore Botanic Gardens carefully watering a plant. The plaque reads about nurturing. This is what the whole Garden is about, but blended so uniquely with advanced technology it is a marvel to behold."
,,Best city garden,5.0,,"The site offers a large variety of activities and dining offered under a mainstream appeal. As far as greenery goes in Singapore, this a tip top!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Incredible design and space. You walk up, through and around a central structure with plants all around. Little pricey but very unusual. The AC is on full and is actually cold, good on a hot day."
,,"One of two “domes” in a wonderful garden/Park setting, displaying in a spectacular way plants from the cloud line.",5.0,,"The dome has a central waterfall the height of the building and it is possible to walk round it, then go by lift to the top and walk down on amazing walkways, behind and around the waterfall. It is not for those with vertigo and tricky for wheelchairs but possible. Gentle slope all the way down. The air is misty, wet atmosphere, displaying plants found up mountains and highlands in the cloud line. Also they have an excellent display of ceramic and plastic flowers and plant sculptures."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"The could forest was awesome! It had a huge waterfall inside and was just stunning. This is a must see in Singapore. There is a cloud walk that goes about six stories high which is beautiful. It is well worth the money. Just make sure you take photos before the misting happens, otherwise your photos will be a bit foggy. Definitely a great stop!"
,,AMAZING,5.0,,Do yourself a favor and visit the Cloud Forest. It truly was a highlight of my trip to Singapore. Inside you can see amazing views of the city and MBS. It was awe-inspiring. Worth the extra money to view.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Spent 3 hours strolling round this dome. Amazing waterfall as you enter - really cools you down : ) Beautiful plants and orchids. Excellent wood carvings. Super place : )
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Quite cold in there of course! So bring a wrap or shawl. Stunning waterfall and canopy walk. Brilliant display.
,,Nice place,4.0,,Pretty nice place to visit. Great to escape from the hot weather and to see plants one would not normally find in Singapore. Beware of splashing water from the waterfall and it can be quite humid inside.
,,Cool place to visit while at the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,This was a good thing to do while it was raining quite a bit. It's an awesome structure that we took advantage to integrate into our children's home-schooling. It's well done and educational. Has some interesting videos and exhibits at the end which make you think about the environment. Definitely recommended!
,,Afternoon visit to both Hothouses and the Skywalk,4.0,,A fantastic use of what 15 years ago on a previous visit was scrubland. Amazing extra amenity to a City that has everything
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,"I visited the Cloud Forest for about 2 hours on a Sunday. There was a minimal line to get into the dome, and there is generally a guided route through the Forest. The wait for the elevators leading to the top of the Forest was a bit lengthy, but the walk along the various bridges down back to ground level was enjoyable. There are nice views throughout, giving visitors a nice view of the Singapore skyline.

There is a shuttle bus from the Gardens entrance to the two domes including the Cloud Forest, but alternatively it is a nice 10 minute through the gardens."
,,Spectacular !,4.0,,"Beautiful, and spectacular for the nature lovers ! The architecture is fabulous, the views amazing ! My kids loved it as well. A Must-see place in Singapore !"
,,Very unique!,5.0,,The cloud forest is stunning - the 'manufactured' trees support plant and animal life and are an unusual dimension to the Bay area. They are particularly stunning at night when they light up. A must visit whilst in Singapore.
,,Artificial yet Amazing,4.0,,"There is an entry fee (guess 28$/person)

As soon any 1 entered we can see the giant waterfall and sprinkling water do give some excitement to start the forest journey.
well maintained and lots of themed gardens were attractive.

A good place to grab enough selfies with varied flower creature."
,,Just WOW!,5.0,,"Wow, what a place to be. You just feel like you are in the middle of the amazon forest. They also create artificial mist and fog using very fine water particles. The cloud walk is a major attraction and a very good photo location"
,,Head in the clouds,5.0,,"Fabulous enormous greenhouse filled with tropical plants built up to a great height.

The waterfall and the plants are superb to see.

The walkway at the top let's you really appreciate the plants.

As a lover of LEGO the carnivorous plant section built of the bricks was excellent.

Another fantastic experience in Singapore."
,,Really interesting,4.0,,"Had a really good walk around the Cloud Forest, along with about 2,000 other people at the same time. But, it was spectacular and worth the visit."
,,Good,4.0,,"Probably a bit heavy on environmentalist preaching (we know, ok!) but nevertheless an amazing space to experience."
,,It's was god gift box,5.0,,I'm very happy to Allah. He send to me in the world . And give me opertuniey for see very nature views. Cloud forest need to be very country in the world. I wash for every propels Of living in the world.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,A must do when in Singapore. Very well organised and constructed. Educational and a fun place to go. Very reasonably priced. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit.
,,Wow,5.0,,Fantastic trail through a jungle landscape within a biome. A truly awesome spectacle that has to be seen to be appreciated.
,,Best part of garden by bay,5.0,,There is a magic in this attractions. So beautifully designed with so many varieties of flowers & trees..lift available to reach the top level. Many selfie booth options are there.
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"It is within the gardens by the bay, and an absolute must-see. Giant plants and trees, waterfalls, all beautifully laid out."
,,Unique and entertaining,5.0,,"This is a great way to escape the city hustle for a brief nature exploration! There are so many different types of plants, water features and information. You get great views of the skyline and the singapore flyer while walking through. I would highly recommend to combine with the nightly show at the super tree grove! Definitely a highlight for us in Singapore!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A great place to visit during a rainy Singapore afternoon. Very well presented, and plants are well kept. Highly recommended."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Beautiful plants everywhere. We spent about 2 hours browsing everything and reading fun facts. I definitely appreciated the cold air so that we could take a break from the humid Singapore weather.
,,An amazing architecture and logistical masterpiece,5.0,,"To build this sanctuary to rare plants from all over the world is an amazing achievement. The glass is of a special kind, which allowes the inside climate to be stable using eco friendly methods."
,,Worth Seeing.,5.0,,"This is worth seeing because of the beauty, but also the cost is actually fair. Singapore is expensive, so coming here and chilling, relaxing and walking about is quite nice. Feels like Jurassic Park."
,,My child’s school excursion,5.0,,"It’s simply breathtaking, the waterfall is sooooooo cool and I can’t help but to boomerang like 100000x Walk around and enjoy the awesome views, loveeee the cooling man made weather. Go over to Cloud Forest and Experience it yourself 🎡💯"
,,Beautiful conservatory,5.0,,This conservatory is lovely you get to walk around and up high into the conservatory surrounded by lush flowers and plants. Well cared for and a great way to spend time in Singapore also nice and cool in there so good way to escape the heat for a bit
,,waterfall 💧,5.0,,"It is so cold inside the cloud forest. so refreshing. u can walk to the top of it by lift. Green is everywhere. so calming. There are so much to see, u should check it urself 😊"
,,A sober reminder of our dying forests,5.0,,"We went there thinking it is another effort of tourist display. And we came out very inspired to do something in order to save the earth.

The cloud forest was designed to be like a mountain with cool mist, plants, waterfalls and even a cave. Do make time to read the exhibits, they tell alot about the damage to our current nature.

A good place to educate our next generation about keeping mother nature intact. Bundle up tho, temperatures may be quite cold esp in the nights."
,,A mesmerizing world,5.0,,"I visited here with my family. We spent almost a day there. It was such a place.
A breath taking one. The chilli and cool breeze takes us in to a real rain forest.

Cloud Forest, is a mysterious world veiled in mist. We can learn about rare plants and their fast-disappearing environment here.
I am helpless to explain it in words. You have to feel it.

Open daily:
9.00am - 9.00pm
Last ticket sale: 8.00pm 
Last admission: 8.30pm"
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"We visited the cloud forest at the gardens by the bay for 1 to 2 hours. This place is quite spectacular considering it is all man-made. The waterfall is quite stellar. The inside is air-conditioned, so great for a visit in warm weather. There are a lot of beautiful flowers and plants. There was an orchid exhibit during our visit, which was quite stunning. We bought our tickets from Klook.com at a significant discount and paid about US dollars 15 per ticket."
,,Worth paying to see this,5.0,,"Easily spend a good few hours in here, just marvellous, and worth paying to go in. This is one of 2 huge glass houses, that also includes a film theatre with educational documentaries. It can be quite busy, but it didn’t detract from the sheer joy of seeing such stunning displays, and huge varieties of plants. It is not hot inside, but very pleasant. I loved it so much I am planning a return trip with my Mum, she will adore seeing all the plants."
,,Fun and interesting for all ages,5.0,,"Great experience particularly for those of you who like to take pictures. Once you head inside the dome you are left to your own devices. You can take as long as you like walking around and you will be happy to hear it is very cool temperature wise once inside !
There is a lot of scenery to take in, from the waterfall, to the flowers and of course the Lego pond on top. There is also some interesting videos about the effects of climate change and how people are working to prevent it."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Amazing place to visit in Singapore. It was beautiful and colourful. Don’t go home before you visit this dome. It was amazing. And colourful.
,,Worth it! Go!,5.0,,An oasis from the heat packed with unusual specimens presented beautifully. The waterfall is a big draw and gorgeous.
,,A MUST VISIT ICON in Singapore,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay- Cloud Forest.
If you are a visitor to Singapore, this is definitely a must-visit tourist attraction (even for local citizens like me).

Compared to the Flower Dome, which has several different exhibitions being rotated throughout the year, the Cloud Forest is always consistent.

A slow and thorough visit to see and experience everything inside this dome will take about three hours (if you pace slowly and read all the descriptions and signs all around the place, including viewing the informative video show about ""global warming"".)

At the entrance, you will be greeted by the massive artificial ""waterfall"", which makes a great spot for photo taking. You will slowly descent the mild-slope upwards till you reach the lifts to go to the top floors.

Wheelchair-bound visitors may also use designated lifts that bring them to the top of the dome, and you can descend from there.

There can be certain spots where the floor may be slippery due to wetting by the water/droplets from the ""waterfall"". Elderly visitors should take care when wearing ""frictionless"" footwear like flip-flops or high-heels.
Sport shoes and working shoes/leather shoes are fine/work best.

There are toilets within the cloud forest, so visitors need not worry.
For visitors who wish to hydrate (drink) with plain water, there are some water-coolers located just outside the toilets.

TIP: For visitors who can spend more time there (eg: whole day), my tip for you is to go for the ""RE-ENTRY"" stamping at the exit gantries, where the staff will stamp you with a ultraviolet colour stamp which, you can come back into the dome in the evening time or at night.

NOTE: Last entry into the cloud forest is at 8.30pm, and all visitors must leave by about 9pm!

Visitors be reminded to consider wearing very comfortable shoes, as the walking distance from the nearest hotel (Marina Bay Sands) is about 600 metres at least.

Cheers!"
,,I love this place!,5.0,,"This is an amazing experience. I bring all of my Singapore guests here. Many have been skeptical, but no one has been anything less than amazes! This is a do not miss for Singapore tourists!"
,,Beautiful amazing walk,5.0,,This is very beautiful and amazing. How do they get those plants to grow like that? They take you up to the top and the you walk down. Easy slope to walking is fine. Strollers and wheelchairs are welcome. At brooms are nice as well as the drink venue. Inside is temperature controlled so humidity is non existent. Flowers are spectacular. Enjoy the movie at the end as well.
,,Great adventure,5.0,,Even for no botanic friends a really great event you should visit (it takes just 30-40 min. to go round).
,,Tried both domes,5.0,,"Went there with a friend. Most bautiful garden you can see in Singapore. With the place being coola and air conditioned, its a great place for a stroll to see how the flowers are integrated into the architecture of the place. Definitely recommend a visit"
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,Cloud forest is situated at gardens by the bay...it is a giant glass dome which u can see from far away...it is amazing from outside as well as inside...it is fully air conditioned...u can relax in cool atmosphere inside in hot days..there is indoor waterfall raining from 100 feet above which is tallest indoor waterfall in the world..amazing place for photography....never skip it...
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,This was the highlight of my trip. Loved all the beautiful flowers and the way they are displayed. There are a number of wood carvings which look amazing.
,,Well Worth A Couple Hours,5.0,,"Of the two domed gardens, this is the most interesting. See the waterfall from many levels along with the interesting plants throughout. It will cost you about $20 to go in."
,,Experiencing Singapore,5.0,,"Well, I still remember when I came here for the 1st time. Was a great experience tho
This place is so cool.
Good place to explore, relax & chill
So clean, dizzy and more I can say
Singapore always amaze me
Will come back again

Cheers

,,A Must Visit When In Singapore,5.0,,"Superb gardens that are housed in a huge enclosure. Waterfalls, many exotic plants. Recommend that you spend the afternoon exploring. Highly recommended."
,,Heavenly and Mouth Dropping Awe!,5.0,,"Surrounding beauty, great photo ops for gorgeous picture taking. Family friendly, well staffed, and wheel chair accessible."
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,"We visited the cloud forest in the evening. As it got darker outside and the subdued lighting came on, the whole atmospher changed. We took so long going round (twice) we got asked to leave as they were closing."
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,Excellent . Easy walking path and wheelchair friendly . Waterfall and all the sculptures and plants are amazing .
,,Green Heaven,5.0,,"Great botanical garden

This is part of the Marina Bay complex, but you need to pay a fee to get in.

Beware that this place is key COLD! This may be a welcome thing in this hot city but some people may need a sweater for this attraction.

This is an amazing botanical garden with a huge variety of flowers. The orchids were the highlight.

Next door is the flower dome, but the name of the place is misleading. There are some flowers, but the main theme is desert plants. To see flowers you really need to go to the Cloud Forest dome."
,,Not as good as I thought!,3.0,,"I have some reservation to recommend others to visit this attraction if you have time constraints. Flower Dome is definitely a better venue to visit in terms of flower varieties and its presentation. Cloud Forest's design is far too artificial/unnatural and not too educational at all. However, love the fact that it is fully air-conditioned.

Anyway, I don't think it is worth queuing as it can get rather crowded during peak hours."
,,So interesting,5.0,,I loved my visit here to see the vast array of plant life and experiences a misting. It was easy to get around. The science around the cooling and watering is so interesting. Well worth a visit
,,Quick visit,3.0,,"As someone from tropical country, the plants are not that interesting for me. 1 hr is more than enough for me. The mist show is not worth the wait"
,,Beautiful Forest Gardens,5.0,,This is another attraction that I highly recommend you visit while visiting the Gardens by the bay. You can walk around everywhere. The Cloud Forest is amazing and you can take some excellent photos in there. It's not expensive to visit.
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"Really enjoyed visiting this, if you can only afford to see one of the indoor gardens pick this one over the Flower display."
,,Beautiful Garden Dome,5.0,,"I really love this part of the Gardens by the bay. This is a paid area and it is fully air conditioned. Strictly no food and drink inside though there are restrooms inside. Once entered, the path is one way towards the exit so it is not easy to backtrack.

When you enter the dome, you will be greeted by this cool breeze from the waterfall. It is beautiful and breath taking and it is still my favorite part of the whole garden.

As you walk towards the back of the garden, you will take a lift up to the 6th floor (be prepared to queue) and then up 2 flights of stairs to 7th floor (there are lifts, but again, long wait). From the 7th floor, you will walk what they call the cloud path down towards the 5th floor... A lot of photo opportunities and I can't exactly describe the view with words. On one side you will see a towering wall of plants, on the other, you will see the Marina Bay views.

This place is great for you to take a slow stroll though with young children, they may fear the height.

The garden is filled with explanation tables and the names of the plants on display so there is plenty of learning too!"
,,A great concept,5.0,,Simply- don't miss it. A unique perspective of 'sky' plants on an artificial mountain complete with a beautiful waterfall. Probably the coolest place in Singapore.
,,Focus on climate change,5.0,,"This was my favourite part of the Gardens by the Bay for its focus on teaching about how precious and rare and important plants are for the earths survival. Even if you aren't into plants, it is fascinating to learn about plants growing high in the mountains and their benefits. I also found the presentation and exhibit about the effects of climate change very moving. It's great to see what Singapore are doing to combat this. Be prepared for big lines to get to the top of the mountain."
,,An amazing Waterfall...,4.0,,"As I entered the main Entrance, I was welcomed by a Massive , Beautiful and Mesmerizing waterfall.
The place is called Cloud Forest as the you feel you are in clouds and seeing the forest from the top.
its green everywhere and you get to experience the Trees and Flowers from way up.
There is a massive Water fall flowing from the top and I took the Lift to reach the top.
From there we walked down, checking out the various Trees around.

Its really amazing to see the way it is created and maintained.
Washrooms and water facility available.
its totally Air Conditioned Inside."
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,"Well worth the time spent here. The place is just beautiful, with such a serine feeling. And the size you will not believe how big the place is."
,,A place to visit!,4.0,,"The cloud forest exhibits flora of tropical forests of heights above 700m sea level. Among them you will see amazing orchids, nice waterfalls, carnivorous plants. A nice place to have a relaxing walk. I was expecting more info on the flowers though."
,,Just amazing!,5.0,,"I don't know how the cloud forest works but it's very much a visual spectacle. It's all real, makes you feel like you're in a rain forest...the humidity and plants eco system make this a great spectacle and visit. We walked all the way to the top to view. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,"A truly delightful place, very interesting species & plants from around the globe in a lovely setting. Entrance price a little steep though."
,,Surprisingly cool,4.0,,"After roaming the gardens in the sweltering heat , watching kids playing in the water park ( should have bought our bathers) we walked into the cloud dome and the cool air was amazing! We expected some sort of green house but it was far better. A huge waterfall and many levels of plants to smell, see and photograph as you walk around it. Well worth the $13 ticket. That was for the two pavilions. The second one was full of cacti and succulents and was probably my favourite as i found these plants fascinating. Must do in Singapore."
,,i love the waterfall,5.0,,i came here because of friends from overseas. but to my surprise i actually love it inside here. it doesnt feel like im in singapore. of course for people with nature surrounding them this might be nothing. but in singapore we need man-made landscapes like these ones.
,,Fantastic ! A Must if in Singapore,5.0,,"Never seen anything like this anywhere in the world ! So cleverly done and very informative about the world's climate and challenges !
Stunning plants and views for every age group. There is a garden even made from Lego ! Two different domes guide you through the different plants and climates of the world brilliantly !
Absolutely unmissable !!"
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,It is definitely worth paying the entry fee to the Cloud Forest. It has been put together with great care in order to let visitors experience high altitude terrain and flora. It demonstrates it well but trying to find the exit can be problematic if you choose not to walk to the top.
,,A 'Wow' Experience,5.0,,"I just loved to see the ""WOW"" expression of my overseas friends from Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and also local Singaporean when they entered the Cloud Forest.
It's an amazing experience with great view and never get tired of visiting the forest even it's my 8 times there."
,,What a magnificent place to see.,5.0,,The cloud forest is unbelievable. We could not believe the size and the plants that filled it. We spent hours wandering through it and taking photos. It is so large that you need to give yourself plenty of time to take it all in.
,,Refreshing,5.0,,I found this place very interesting.We had visited this place during afternoon when the sun was scorching hot so when we went inside it felt so refreshing in the airconditioning.It's got the highest indoor waterfall.And it's lush green with a lot of vegetation around.This attraction has a entrance
,,Wonderful conservatory,5.0,,"Beautiful, from the moment you walk in you are under the waterfall. Make the effort to walk to the top and then wander down through ball the plants. Excellent"
,,Very nice walk around.,5.0,,"There's a lift to the very top and you can walk down to the bottom. Its wheelchair accessible too. Spent a lovely afternoon walking round. The waterfall is quite nice, nothing spectacular but still very nice. Its air conditioned inside too."
,,A Fantastic walk through the Garden.,4.0,,"A fantastic walk through the Cloud forest Garden. Outside humid and warm, inside cool and nice. Very much to Look at, even if you are not a Botanik ! You must have seen it!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Probably the most amazing places you will ever see. Words cannot describe the beauty of the flora. A plethora of orchids and other beautiful plants. Plus a very big waterfall.
,,Incredible,5.0,,The entry is something not to be described but felt. You are greeted by a waterfall and the walk to the top passing various plant displays and coming back through the interior. Top stuff
,,Stunning is the word for this one! One tru man made wonder.,5.0,,Cloud forest was breath taking in all aspects right from start to finish. Pictures don't do justice to the tallest indoor waterfall in the world and the hundreds of types of plants surrounding it. What a stunning idea to have implemented with as much beauty as it could have. A walk on the 6 level pathway winding around the waterfall keeps you wondering how on earth could any one built such a fascinating structure. Truly mesmerizing!
,,Memorable visit but the crowds can be too much,4.0,,"We happened to go to the cloud forest on the Chinese New Year so the place was full! It would be great if you can avoid the crowd, you will enjoy the man-made forest more. The stalagmite and stalagmites are wonderful and whole idea of plants at various altitude is brilliantly executed."
,,Cloud Forrest experience,5.0,,By a ticket to the Cloud Forrest and experience the different altitude levels and vegetation of this wonderfull display. Well worth the entrance money.
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"The Cloud forest was a great, interesting place to walk through. Be prepared to get a little wet as you walk past the waterfalls."
,,This was my favourite of all the places in the garden.,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is favourite of all the places in the garden.

It was awesome with a huge 35 meter man made mountain dominating the dome, but what really tops it off is the tallest indoor waterfall in the world thundering down one side. You can explore the interior of the mountain, which includes a treetop boardwalk, stalactites and stalagmites and some great views of the Marina Bay area including the famous Marina Bay Sands).

As soon as we walkd in this huge waterfall welcomed us and it was amazing to look at. From there we queue up for the lift which will took us to the top level of the mountain and then we could go down the cloud walk.

It is so fun to walk down the amazing path from which you can see different views from different floors."
,,Wow. Wow. Wow. Speechless,5.0,,Words cannot describe what has been created here. It is a marvel walking through the cloud forest through the 7 levels with the weather and flora changing at every level. I cannot describe how beautiful this garden was. Very well planned and executed. Wow!
,,Grogeous,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest provides for an innovative, beautiful experience. It was very well done and highly recommended."
,,Amazing Glasshouse,5.0,,"Unbelievable. Such a clever concept with great design features, high waterfall, higher walkways with stunning flora, with the bay shore buildings as a backdrop."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"A fantastic array of plant life and structures, and the damp environment will certainly cool you down a bit."
,,A whole new world,5.0,,Completely pleased and amazed by this place. Very ecological and they have stations that educate you about environment. Great place for pictures and to just visit
,,Stairway to heaven,5.0,,Never been in a rainforest before but I am sure this one beats the lot. Floral overload and jaw dropping amazing waterfall and flowers. Don't expect to see that inside a glass house. Can certainly recommend this horticultural experience
,,No monkeys or parrots,1.0,,"This was exactly as shown in the pics. A whole lot of plants and wateefalls with sculptures hidden throughout. There were no monkeys or parrots at all. When i complained, they were confused why i thought there would be monkeys or parrots. Rubbish"
,,Forest in the Clouds!,5.0,,Absolutely brilliant attraction! The main waterfall is stunning and the variety of plants and trees is spectacular! An absolute must-see attraction in Singapore.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"I bought the ticket (28$ including Flower Dome) and loved every minute. Beautiful flowers, trees and decorations. There were a lot of people, so I would avoid Sundays and holidays :) Took me about 2-3, and could've stayed more. Recommended."
,,"Awesome, simply awesome",5.0,,Entering this dome you are confronted by a waterfall which introduces you to the ecology of mountain and forest. Take the elevator to the very top and slowly walk down the spiral path taking in the variations in plant life at different altitudes. Go the basement and see how stalagmites and stalactites form. Recommend going around 4pm so you can then stay for the light show at the Supertree Grove or you could walk over to Marina Bay to see that light show.
,,Plant lovers dream come true,5.0,,"Holy cow. Seriously.

Spent a whole afternoon here and walked the circuit as slowly as I could taking everything in.
Even if your not a plant nerd you’ll love this.
Super busy with tourists on weekends but I couldn’t care less as I was so mesmerised by the plants"
,,Interesting for all ages and all types,5.0,,This display is so varied and interesting that I’m sure anyone could find something of interest to look at. The environment changes to suit the plants as you walk around so you can go from hot and dry or damp to cooler and wet. The raised walkways create a great way to view the gardens and even when there are many people there it still seems relaxing.
,,Breathtaking cloud 9 experience!,5.0,,"Start early if you want to make the most from this attraction, one of the many at Gardens by the Bay. Be ready to get sprayed with mist, feel cold and humid with mountain air, awestruck by steep view deck. Or perhaps, you are just a lover of plants, gardens, and anything green yet alive. You will definitely be thrilled by this exhibit. Could get crowded anytime and a little bit touristy. Make sure small children are accompanied at all times. A marvelous place for young and old alike to learn about this great planet God placed us in."
,,Absolutely unique,5.0,,This was amazing and like a trip to the future. It features a man made six stories waterfall and an awesome vertical garden.
,,Amazing Space,5.0,,The Cloud Forest Dome is a must visit attraction for all nature lovers and more! I was amazed by how they managed to put together all rainforest and tropical plants under one humongous greenhouse! Being educated about how human activity affects nature was certainly a value added to this attraction.
,,Must see,5.0,,The is amazing and beautiful. You will need about an hour to do it justice. The cool atmosphere also makes it a lovely reprieve from Singapore humidity.
,,Fantastic waterfall!,5.0,,"This artificial waterfall really amaze me. Very different atmosphere compare to the city. They have nice collections too. Perfect place to take photo. But i need to buy ticket for both attraction (with flower dome, i wish can buy ticket just for this place)"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It is amazing place in singapore u most see .tosound kind of tree from every world is there . It is takes 2 hour for visiting
,,Cloud Forest on a Hot Day,4.0,,This was a great place to go to escape the city and feel some nature around. Always saw photos of this place and was curious if it was as good as it appeared. Had a fun tour i got from The Asia by the hop on hop off bus that landed me at Garden by the Bay. Cloud Forest was just what I needed while being in the city. Flower Dome was interesting too but I spent most of my time over at the Cloud Forest just hanging out and taking pictures.
,,Go when they activate the mist sprays.,4.0,,"Of the two domes we much preferred the Cloud Forest with its more exotic plants and fauna.
To keep the dome at the right humidy for the exhibits there are ""misting"" sprays at certain times of the day...certainly at noon when we were inside...and below looking up towards the mist is impressive.
The humidy did fog up the camera lens under the skylight filters when we left.
We were unfortunate to enter at the same time as two large tour groups. The walkways are not big enough for lots of people to stand around taking photos. So we let them pass and after that it was fine."
,,Unexpected Highlight of Vacation,5.0,,The Cloud Forest was an unexpected highlight of my trip. Really amazing man-made ecosystem. Expect to send a few hours exploring. Do not recommend if you are afraid of heights- as my friend found out.
,,A green wonder with a conscience,4.0,,"Cloud Forest in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay is an eye-opener on so many levels. First off, you're greeted by a roaring waterfall immediately when you enter. Cloud Forest boasts one of the tallest, if not the tallest, indoor waterfalls and its only the beginning to the wonders ahead.

The water cascades down a tower of green, foliage adorning every inch of the multiple-stories tall structure of the Cloud Forest. Following the circling pathway leads you up and through the green and flowers to the tower top from where you can view the head of the waterfall and begin your educational journey down, around, and through the Cloud Forest.

The attraction works on a number of levels: placards give a good deal of information on a mountain's ecosystem and there are more than enough picturesque views and unique flowers and plants to satisfy all needs for pictures and selfies. Plus the cool respite from Singapore's humidity comes as a true blessing. You might consider bringing a light jacket or overshirt as the temperature does drop a few degrees inside.

Where Cloud Forest truly surpasses other tourist or garden attractions is in its lowest levels. Like a reverse Dante's trip from heaven to hell, after winding your way down the green paradise of Cloud Forest, the only way to exit is through an exhibition on human impact on the environment. While not explicitly graphic, the exhibition and accompanying film paint a bleak picture of human destruction of the environment and the devastating effects of global warming.

You do learn that Cloud Forest is a completely self-sustained environment, but little else that is man-made is so environmentally friendly. This is the rare attraction which asks its visitors to truly look at their impact on the world around them and question what they can do to make life better.

Cloud Forest doesn't leave you in a state of doom for long, though, as the way out then leads back to greenery and miniature orchids and eventually the gift shop.

Be sure to get your hand stamped so you can come back later that same day. I'd recommend going earlier in the day to see Cloud Forest in daylight, then coming back at night during one of the mistings, when the plants are being watered. Colored lights come on at night and clouds of mist are released to help water the greenery. The entire complex is filled with haze, turning Cloud Forest into a surreal world of mist and light."
,,Romance in the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"It's always a special day when you spend it with the woman of your life! My wife and I have visited Gardens by the Bay several times and we keep coming back. This time it was the Cloud Forest conservatory. As we entered, the breath taking view of the Cloud Mountain and water fall immediately whisked us away into another world.

The cool and comfortable moist conditions contrasted with the warm afternoon that we just left behind. The sound of the water falling, the mild ""mist"" that greeted us and the sight of the 42-metre (I checked the write-up) high Cloud Mountain... we were loving this even before the start of the exploration.

We took the customary welfie at the foot of the waterfall and a slow walk through the ground level. We were absolutely marvelled by the beautifully and carefully crafted mix of flora and plants in full array of colors. The lift at the ground floor took us up 6 floors, where a short climb up a flight of stairs brought us to the peak.

My wife and I joined other enchanted visitors in the slow descend via a circular path, taking time to take in the sights of flowers and plants in close range. The refreshing cool air made the walk an absolute enjoyment. On the way down, there were other attractions (or maybe for some, these were distractions) - such as the display of ""crystal mountain"", the necessary educational display and documentary on climate change...

The romance of the Cloud Forest continued into the ""Secret Garden"" at the basement of the conservatory where garden sculptures and landscapes reached out to lingering visitors reluctant to leave this fantasy world...

Thankfully, the transitory world outside the conservatory was also alluring (apart from the warmer conditions) in its own ways :- the second conservatory ""Flower Dome"", the waterfront gardens, the Skyway for a birdeye's view of Gardens by the Bay, the Supertree Grove, the Children's Garden, and the nearby ""Satay by the Bay"".

Spend the afternoon to explore the entire Gardens by the Bay. Dinner options are plenty, and the beautifully lit Supertree Grove by night is worth the wait. Forget the world and experience the Garden for a few hours... I can only imagine how Garden of Eden might have been like, and Gardens by the Bay gave me a gllimpse of what it might really look and feel like."
,,"Cool, surreal and definitely worth visiting",4.0,,"A mountain forest housed in a giant dome, like something out of a science fiction movie the cloud forest is very cool (which on a 38 degree day can be a godsend). Take a camera and prepare to be impressed"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Beautiful man-made conservatory forest. You will not feel that you're in a tropical forest because the temperature here is quite cold due to air conditioning. There's an artificial waterfall inside the conservatory right after the enterance gate.
,,Just stuning,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay complex, the Cloud Forrest features a rainforest and the associated eco-climate. Brilliantly conceived and executed, this is a self sufficient bio-diverse unit. Well worth the visit."
,,Highlight of Gardens of the Bay,5.0,,A wonderful experience myriads of plants of all types clinging to the mountain adorn this huge man made structure complete with lifts winding paths and waterfall misted section ample places for photos truly spectacular worth the visit we will return!
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Great experience, different from anything else. Put time aside, suggest half a day for both the Gardens and the Cloud forest"
,,Wonderful walk down the man made mountain to ground level,5.0,,"Walk though different weather zones and see the waterfall. Take the lift up to the top of the ""mountain"" and walk down to ground level. This is a must do!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,The Cloud Forrest is something very special tropical flowers air walk water falls with fantastic views of Singapore and the harbour unfortunately the flower dome was closed the day we visited disappointing but worth the visit
,,Well worth the admission,5.0,,"Another ""must see"" for anyone interested in nature and plants. Simulates an ever increasing altitude as you go through the exhibition, and the effect on plants."
,,Аmazingly,5.0,,Very interesting air-conditioned dome with a vertical garden in it. It's located in Gardens by the Bay and its visit is definitely worth it though it's pretty expensive.
,,Absolutely brilliant,5.0,,"The best attraction in the Bay Gardens and Parks. All the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, Tree bar, Sky walk etc are fabulous."
,,Spectacular experience.,5.0,,"The entire area of Gardens by the Bay is well laid out and easy to navigate. They offer a shuttle from the subway stop to the domes for 3 SD each, we chose to use it as it was incredibly hot and muggy the day we went, money well spent. The dome that houses the forest display is a wow moment from the time you enter and see the high waterfall until you walk in ""the clouds"" at the top along the elevated walkways and look down. Very well done and unique experience from any other indoor flora display we have seen in our travels."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, spend plenty of time to see all that it has to offer on multiple levels. I would recommend it."
,,You will swear you are in a rain forest.,5.0,,What an amazing place. The size is huge and there are elevators that go up for many stories. The way it is structured makes it feel like you are surrounded by a rain forest. Stunning in every way!
,,Beautiful place for a visit even if plants are your thing,5.0,,"If you go for a day visit, get a stamp to come back at night because it's a whole different experience.
Preferred this over the flower dome as it just feels complete, the flower dome felt like a bunch of pot plants, this place feels like an ecosystem.
At night it can get a bit cool"
,,Family vacation,4.0,,"Good concept.i was a bit disappointed when I actually visited the place.Not as good a ‘cloud and mountain’ experience as described.overall good place to visit with family.if you are travelling with children, be ready to carry them as it’s long way to walk."
,,Lovely!!,5.0,,A lovely and interesting place to visit! Very atmospheric and interesting!! There are different levels but the access is easy and lifts are available if required.
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,One of the highlights of our short stay in Singapore. This is a very cleverly put together display. You can easily spend more than an hour in there.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"Incredible place to visit in Singapore, Waterfall from the entrance is super amazing! walking through to climb is awesome to see the sky from up and the waterfall from down"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The whole of the Gardens By The Bay Area is spectacular. Most of it is free but you need to purchase tickets for the two conservatories- The Cloud Forest and the Flower Garden. I bought our combo tickets back in the UK before travelling. I only paid around £20 for tickets to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour ( two routes) and tickets for both conservatories. The Cloud Forest isn’t as colourful as the Flower Garden but is as breathtaking in its own way. As soon as you enter there is a large waterfall . You wind your way around and end up at the top of the waterfall, with a walkway winding it’s way back down around the whole structure. The planting is amazing, everywhere you look is a visual delight."
,,A must see indoor forest with varities of plants from several countries.,5.0,,What a collections of plants from around the world !!!. Take a free guided tour to understand the intricacies of the curation.
,,Stunning area,5.0,,This was part of the two place ticket for cloud forest and flower dome. We went in the morning not to busy and nice and cool well laid out wonderful flowers and amazing sculptures. We spent an hour or so here and enjoyed the cool temperatures and wonderful displays and views. Take the time and come here you won’t be disappointed
,,Amazing artificial forest,5.0,,"I don’t usually use the word amazing but this place really is. It’s so hard to believe that we are in a man-made forest because the complete atmosphere gives you the feeling of being in a dark forest.

Every level has a different kind of garden with clear information about the various plants, flowers, and trees. There are wonderful wooden sculptures and animal forms and yes, orchids everywhere.

The waterfall is one of the main highlights and the fact that the whole dome is temperature controlled makes it a comfortable 3-4 hour adventure. A little bit crowded and distracting with everyone trying to take pictures but that is part of the scene."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"This cloud experience is part of the multi billion dollar park that is dedicated to the environment. It really is a must see when visiting. It is alongside the flower dome. Put together they are an interesting, dedicated, informative and valuable experience. Don’t miss them!"
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"When I entered the complex, I was immediately confronted by a towering forest structure. As I looked up, I saw walking paths winding in and around the forest and extending outward above ground.

I was told that the interior is naturally cooled and it did feel like I was in a damp, cool, mini rain forest environment. Along with all the greenery, the vertical forest contains exhibits, displays, and info graphics that focuses mainly on sustainability and conservation.

It's definitely a must see attraction in Singapore."
,,Place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you simply have to go there. I never saw anything like that. Waterfalls, flowers, multi-level gardens, and all under the dome."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Like stepping into another world. Absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful wood carvings used throughout that will blow your mind. Kids loved all of the different levels, waterfalls,lego garden and the crystal display. Orchids are everywhere. Lifts available but a nice walk and awesome views of Singapore Flyer and surrounds from the top levels. Nice and cool on a humid day. A must see for all."
,,A brilliant piece of engineering and gardening,5.0,,"We took the MRT to visit this wonderful tourist attraction. The range and quality of the plantings in massive vertical gardens is an utter wonder. The views from the elevated walkway are spectacular, and the moist cool air is so refreshing. We spent at least two hours wandering around the display, examining many plants in great detail.
The many sculptures of animals and plants were quite delightful.
The venue wasn't too crowded, so it was a pleasant comfortable stroll, enabling us to focus on the display, rather than avoiding all the pedestrians.

It is one of the many highlights of a visit to Singapore."
,,Must-see in Singapore,5.0,,"This is an absolute must see tourist attraction in Singapore.
The cloud forest is fascinating, you could easily spend hours looking around. It is beautiful and is definitely one of the attractions in Singapore that shows how the city is light years ahead of many others in terms of tackling climate change.
Well worth the queue and price for the tickets."
,,A Spectacular Multilevel Tropical Garden,5.0,,"Singapore has many beautiful floral experiences but in my opinion this is the best. This covered garden which may be 10 stories high is a spectacular display of plant life ranging from plants found near sea level to plants found at high altitudes. Even if you think you are not interested in plant life, you will be overwhelmed by this display. Plan to spend at least 4 hours in Gardens by the By with at least two hours in the Cloud Forest"
,,A place to visit to cool down in Singapore heat,5.0,,You can spend few hours watching various types of trees and plants from cold parts if the continents grown in ideal wet musty and cold environment .
,,Amazing is an understatement!,5.0,,This was the highlight of our trip to Singapore. It's an amazing experience to walk amongst the mist while being surrounded by all kinds of exotic flowers! It's very futuristic and out of this world! Definitely a must visit! Bought a ticket that was valid for the cloud forest as well as the flower dome next to it and while both were worth visiting we liked the cloud forest more.
,,Truly a forest,5.0,,Its worth paying for.various types of trees can be found in an artificial biome and is well maintained. Ypu have a waterfall at the entrance of the forest. There are many layers inside.
,,Different.,3.0,,"The creation of a damp rain forest atmosphere has been successful. However it lacks color and has a dark and dingy feel to it. The stairways are like walking up a car park building . They are dark and need painting bright colors . The stairways are grey concrete. Also, there is little information to interest the visitor."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Impressive construction. A masterpiece of engineering, from structure to waterfalls and the plants..."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Great place to visit .....unique and well thought out. Some of the areas are not for the faint hearted (walkways way up in the 'clouds') but well worth going to if you're in Singapore. You'll see such an array of plants, waterfalls raining from up high and even a little movie theatre - excellent ending to our vusit to the gardens by the bay"
,,Walking through the mist and forest,5.0,,"You will be mesmerized as soon as you enter. The artificial falls fully covered with orchids.
Walk through pitcher plant and climb down inside the mist.
You can not enjoy a real forest like this. Kids loved a lot. Spent 3 hrs inside. Never miss this attraction"
,,Keep your feet on the ground.,5.0,,A green thumb's delight. The Cloud forest is worth the possible line up for tickets. A multi level tropical garden wonderland!
,,One of the Best Tourist Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"I would go there almost once every month. This is one of my favorite tourist attraction in Singapore! It is a wonderful place to learn more about the rich diversity of tropical highlands, as well as the threats that they are facing in the 21st century."
,,So amazing I went twice!,5.0,,"Allow plenty of time, take your camera and enjoy! Not just for plant lovers.....this rainforest experience showcases the most remarkable plants growing indoors! Misting in the dome every couple of hours makes this venue even more special. It really is a wonderful, magical place to experience......DO NOT MISS THIS!"
,,Beautiful place to spend the day,5.0,,You need to check if the cloud forest and Flower Dome are both open before you visit as they are closed for maintenance at times. When we visited Cloud forest was closed so had to go back.
,,Breathe taking!,5.0,,A must place to visit when you are in Singapore. This place if fully air conditioner and the whole tour was breathe taking. Recommended to buy both tickets and save when you decided to see Garden Dome and Cloud Forest together.
,,"Yes, you must see this",5.0,,"Wow, indoor waterfalls, every tropical plant you can think of and several hundred more you had no idea existed. The place is immaculate, perfectly maintained and beautifully laid out for visitors. Do not miss this!!!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Cloud Forrest is an amazing place to spend a couple of hours. Beautiful flora all around the indoor waterfall is just stunning. A must see in Singapore
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We toured the cloud dome starting at the waterfall and going all the way up. It is an enclosed environment with amazing plants, trees & flowers. Quite Beautiful"
,,Great setting. Ideal walk at the Garden by the Bay,4.0,,"As most of the attractions at Marina Bay everything is impeccable, reasonable cost. Nice dining options from formal to fast food. Many different alternatives to enjoy !"
,,For a city scape it is a breath of refreshing mist,4.0,,"Of the two cloud domes the Cloud Forest is definitely the best. A walk way winds up through the various mountain zones, lovely orchids are captivating and the lego grove at the top is amazing. Venus fly traps and pitcher plants are reflected in a wonderful pool, well worth the walk up.

The only thing I was disappointed with were the number of decimated stalagmites that had been collected from around the world. They should be left underground to continue to grow."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Our favorite attraction in Singapore. Its a mind boggling experience to imagine all that is Cloud Forest being under one enormous dome. From the incredible waterfall when you first walk in to the tree top walks its a head turning experience the whole way through. A wonderful experience and one that I would recommend for everyone that visits Singapore.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Amazing indoor high rised gardens with a huge selection of plants. Was a bit crowded the day of our visit.
,,Excellent Evening.,5.0,,We had great time this beautiful spot. It was amazing evening. The feature of the environment was colourful and importantly its authenticity.
,,Cloud forest,4.0,,"Still the nice environment, after my 2nd visit, although can't compare much to overseas, it still has that ambience of tranquility"
,,once is enough,4.0,,"been inside twice, if you are a first timer in SG you can go inside for your viewing pleasure. The man-made waterfalls is a wow. and the temperature inside is cold. so wear a jacket. :)"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,I have been in Singapore for quite a few years now but had not made time to visit. This week I did and I was so glad. We went on Wednesday and it was uncrowded. The design and planting are truly spectacular. I was expecting it to be hot but it was a perfect temperature for strolling through. Great beauty.
,,Neat place,4.0,,"Neat experience and kiddos enjoyed it. A little pricey, but really cool concept. Recommend just doing cloud forest and skipping flower area if you are pressed for time/money."
,,This is a Singapore Gem.,5.0,,Located next to the Gardens by the Bay is another must see attraction. The whole place is huge and you are just like in the rain forest with all the beautiful flowers and artworks scattered all over the place. Very beautiful and awesome place to visit.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Lovely bio dome educating visitors about the fauna, animals, effects of climate change, and diversity of a cloud forest. If you go at the right time (every two hours (starting at 10am), they mist the fauna in the bio dome giving you a sense of the humidity in the cloud forest. LEGO is playfully used throughout the biodome to capture interest.

Plus, the Cloud Forest offers a respite from the heat of the day,"
,,Too crowded,3.0,,The place was too crowded when we visited and there was nothing much to see inside. The only saving grace was it had a beautiful view of the river from the bridge.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Decided you go in when we were looking round this Gardens by the Bay. Couldn't believe our eyes , the whole concept is amazing. Cost was £28 each including the flower dome , well worth it"
,,The forest inside Gardens by the Bay in Singapore,5.0,,"An unmissable visit inside the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore: Cloud Forest, a dome that features inside a living forest with waterfall at the entrance and plants from every country around the world. The dome is fully air-conditioned and has a fantastic architecture with bridges and lifts that take you to unforgettable views."
,,"Best view from the bottom,busy and wet!",4.0,,"This is what you will see when you first walk in, so it has a lot of people just standing there. With the water coming down you will get wet from the drizzle as well, not much and if you stand back not at all. Best views are from the bottom but there is a view platform half way up as well and then the top"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is beautifully designed forest garden, and it is definitely worth to pay for a ticket. The waterfalls are obviously amazing, but I enjoyed every part of this astonishing place."
,,"Beautiful building, but really disappointed.",2.0,,"The building's design is stunning, but it is really tacky. More like an amusement park than a place to admire nature. There are enough wonderful plants, without having to resort to fake plastic animals and flowers everwhere."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The water fall and flower dome were amazing. Definitely worth a visit. Plus stay on for the light display in the evening. Well worth a visit
,,excellent,4.0,,I love the concept of building a clound forest in an enclosure. Climb to the top and you will find many even rarer plants.
,,Words cannot describe,5.0,,"You have to see it to believe it. Just great. The waterfall and walkway are just awe inspiring. Truly great imagination, design and construction."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Well worth the extra cost to go inside. Our family had a great time exploring everything. Stunning in every way.
,,Tallest manmade waterfall,5.0,,A good replication of rain forests. Have made a good effort to give the feeling of rain forest and waterfall is also a good scene.
,,Must see Cloud Forest,4.0,,Last time we visit Singapore the amazing Gardens by the Bay was nearing completion but not yet open so it was great to see the finished product. There is no charge for entry to the park but entry prices for the buildings are high so we opted for the Cloud Forest. A great choice. Up in a lift to the top then a lovely walkway back down passing amazing vertical gardens and viewing the waterfall which goes from top to bottom. Very instructive exhibits towards the end of the tour reminding us of the damage we are doing to the environment and its consequences. Very thought provoking. A visit to the Cloud Forest is a must.
,,"Amazing biome, beautiful at night",5.0,,"This is the better of the biomes, spectacular walkway high up and we loved the Lego garden. We visited late in the dark which was very dramatic with no queues for the lifts. Highly recommended."
,,Eco-Friendly and Incredible,5.0,,"After visiting the orchid garden we believed the Cloud Forest would be a quick trip, but were surprised to find how interactive it was. Aside from an amazing structure, the Cloud Forest had entire levels dedicated to teaching you about the need to conserve plant and wildlife on Earth, as well as the consequences of not doing so. Just as informative as it was spectacular!"
,,An introduction to rainforests,5.0,,"Considering Singapore lies in the heart of the tropics, in an area known for its rainforests, it’s hardly surprising that an important section of the Gardens by the Bay should be devoted to rainforests. This is a massive greenhouse called the Cloud Forest. We entered this when it was already getting dark, and therefore couldn’t appreciate the flowers as well as we perhaps would have been able to had we reached during daylight hours.

The first sight that greets you when you enter is a high waterfall (the tallest indoor one in the world). From beyond this, elevators rise several stories to the top, bringing you out at the top of the waterfall. Here, once you’ve admired the view from the top, you can start going down—through a series of walkways that coil around the ‘mountain’ that forms the basis of the forest. At each level, there is some explanatory text to show how rainforests survive and what they consist of, what are their features, and so on. More than that, of course, there are the plants and trees themselves. Orchids, especially, are in profusion here.

Among the noteworthy sections in the Cloud Forest are the Crystal Mountain (which showcases crystals, the mining of which is a factor in the decimation of rainforests) and the Secret Garden, which is a recreation of a Jurassic era landscape, including miniature orchids so tiny that they are displayed behind carefully placed magnifying glasses!

The ground floor of Cloud Forest houses a souvenir shop which includes, besides postcards and the like, some very pretty mementoes crafted from flowers and foliage—especially tiny magenta orchids—from the gardens.

The ticket for Cloud Forest is included in the entry fee for the Flower Dome, so hang on to it if you want to see both sights."
,,Like being in Space - with tropical plants...,5.0,,Incredible.... not enough words to describe this modern day wonder. Next to the Flower dome - buy a joint ticket for best value. The queue for the lift to take iou to the top of the dome looks long - but its efficient and before you know it you are walking in the sky above the plants and amongst the mist... sublime...
,,Stunning display,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the bay attraction this is a ""must see"". Exotic plants from remote parts of the world that only exist in specific climatic conditions. Excellent for a wet day"
,,Feels like a jungle,5.0,,"I love Cloud Forest just because the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in a real jungle, but so much colder. It's very interesting where the man-made waterfall is one of the highest in Singapore too. Definitely a must visit when you are in Singapore"
,,Stunning Place,5.0,,"Spent a good few hours here, a fab way to spend a bit of a rainy day. It was very busy but not overcrowded and we really enjoyed the walk to the top. The care and attention that has gone into this place is immaculate."
,,Absolutely Beautiful,5.0,,One of the most beautiful man-made creations I've ever seen. The whole time I spent in there I was in awe at how amazing it is. Do not miss this truly special place.
,,Highlight of Singapore,5.0,,"Could spend hours inside the dome. The waterfall is spectacular and the range of plant life is amazing. Lifts,escalators and walkways very well done."
,,must see,5.0,,you pay extra to go in the two domes but it is well worth it.cloud forest is the most interesting and I would definitely recommend a visit
,,well worth it,5.0,,This attraction is a must visit when you visit gardens by the bay. Bayfront mrt is the closest......

,,Wonderful..,5.0,,"A wonderful place, nice place to evade from the scorching heat of Singapore. You feel very cool inside and seems like you are in Himalaya. A wonderful man made marble and must visit place with full of natures replica like mountain, trees and water falls."
,,Beautiful but overpriced,3.0,,"This place is beautiful and something else, but overpriced. Cloud forest is anyway better than Flower Dome"
,,educational tour,5.0,,Part of garden by the bay. Nice to visit. The children really appreciated the tour. Educational also
,,WOW ! WOW ! WOW,5.0,,This magical tour leaves you in awe of nature & mans ability to present it in such a setting. Take your time to explore & take literally hundreds & hundreds of pictures to remember its beauty
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,"This was my second visit in the past few years, I was actually sad that the pathway around the mountain has had the floor covered over as it was much more fun walking along and seeing through the grid mesh at the gardens and people below. It was also quite entertaining seeing some people being quite freaked out ha ha!
Anyway, despite the fact that you can no longer see below when walking along the walkway, it is still a lovely place to visit, and even more so if you are struggling with the Singapore humidity and heat!"
,,SOmething new,4.0,,"New experience, I recommend the visitors to see the entire levels because it has different good staff it really worth it .."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"This place is very amazing you must visit it and visit all its parts, the best place in the gardens."
,,water falls & the skywalk inside the dome,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the cloud forest dome. Refreshed with the great water falls in the entrance & the skywalks inside the dome. Really felt like we are at the top of a mountain, caves inside the mountain"
,,Our favorite experience from Singapore,5.0,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest by chance to escape a rain storm. Months later, this is one of our favorite memories of Singapore. Great for kids and adults. Could spend 30 minutes or hours here."
,,Worth the ticket price,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is one of 2 domed areas at Gardens by the Bay. Cloud Forest is a mountain environment with many examples of vegetation that is present in various mountain micro environments. The waterfall is supposedly the highest indoor waterfall in the world. There are suspended walkways on a couple of levels with great views of both the indoor area and outdoors. It is also nice and cool inside, which is a plus in Singapore. The attraction is worth doing if you are spending some time in the Gardens."
,,Climate controlled indoor garden,4.0,,"Air conditioned dome with a walking route designed to show the plants in different levels in mountainous areas. The climate is created with water spray every so often.

Useful to enter during the heat of the day and leave the outdoor gardens for when it is cooler."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We enjoyed this walk around the enclosure. A lot of people, but it wasn't crowded to view all the plants and take pictures."
,,Nice and cool,5.0,,"Was like taking a hike in the mountains, nice and cool. Lots of plant varieties and observation areas"
,,"flower dome, waterfal",4.0,,"this is a something different from another place, this is so beautyful, amazing, care about global warming"
,,Good for thought,5.0,,Interesting place that provokes thought about the planet. Very eerie when the misters go on at 18:00 and a bit spooky. Adjacent to Flower Dome
,,Well worth the small admission fee - don't miss it.,5.0,,Yet another tribute to Singapore's ability to combine nature and engineering. Rare and wonderful plants and a fantastic indoor waterfall.
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,We spent part of our afternoon here as we were sold twin tickets for Cloud Forest & flower dome.its quite an amazing place to visit. A bit like the Eden project only bigger. Inside the dome there is a mountain/forest which you enter by lift. Once at the top you walk down through the mountain. It's very rain foresty with mists swirling around you. A great afternoon spent here & it's well worth it.
,,Tropical,5.0,,This attraction is within the Gardens by the Bay. A must for those interested in flora and fauna. Also interesting displays about earth. Very enjoyable and educational.
,,The Highest Indoor Waterfall in the World!,5.0,,The Cloud Forest has the Highest Indoor Waterfall in the World! It is absolutely awesome to view the waterfall from the base point and also from atop.
,,Really interesting and magical,5.0,,"My children loved it, full of beautiful plants and flowers. The indoor waterfall is amazing. At 2:00pm it even rains. For a snack we had delicious steamed buns sold outside the entrance opposite the entrance to the cloud forest they were amazing!!!!"
,,gardens on the bay,5.0,,"this attraction is within the gardens on the bay and is a spectacular sight to see. the ticket purchases includes this, the flower dome and the rest of the marina bay super tree grove"
,,Great clouds around,5.0,,"Artificial but worth visiting, memorable place and when you reach on top by elevator and walk down the same its gives great feeling."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Completey artifical botanical garden that's indoors and uses water and plants to create a unique experince.
,,Stunning,4.0,,I'm amazed when I saw this place for the first time. I really want to go up at that time. We really had a great time viewing different plant and also taking pictures especially on the inside fall..
,,Awesome Indoor Waterfall and Scene!,5.0,,"After visiting the Gardens we explored the Cloud Forest exhibit and were amazed at the details and feeling as we enter the forest atmosphere.
This is a huge air-conditioned glass dome housing some of the most beautiful and exotic plants from around the world.
We took the elevator to the top and walked down the ramps. The pictures are incredible and the landscaping is beautiful. The scope of the sphere and the size of the wonderland is mind-blowing.
This is a must visit sight when you are in Singapore."
,,Cloud Forest worth to visit,4.0,,"Sure, most of the things you see in Singapore is fake, artificial. But in LasVegas is similar (Canal de Grande in Venitian hotel etc.). The Cloud Forest is nice to walk around, especially if you go the upper walking paths. We enjoyed."
,,Amazing BUT BRING A SWEATER!,5.0,,"We would probably have stayed longer but we were just so cold and couldn´t wait to get back out to the heat. The experience is amazing, however: the highest indoor waterfall and all. There are not as much informative tables inside as I expected therefore I would recommend getting an audio guide. There is a ton of people so you have to be patient with taking pictures. Definitely worth the money and one of the must dos in Singapore."
,,Cool!!!,5.0,,"If you pay to visit only 1 of the 2 indoor exhibits, I would make it this one. It's a nice walk down from the top. Cool, so a nice break from the heat, and overall pretty exceptional."
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,"This is one of the places one should visit while in Singapore. Cost for this place is separate from the Supertree grove skywalk, shuttle service and flower dome. You need at least 30mins to 1 hour to go around the cloud forest dome.

Best time to visit is around 4pm-6pm."
,,Very nice - but take the total package,5.0,,"Take the elevator up to floor six. And walk inside and outside the ""ant nest"" until you have reach the ground floor. Nice!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,Beautifully designed forest with waterfalls and amazing plant life. So many different species in one place...
,,Phase 1,5.0,,We had a wonderful time viewing all the different plants and structures. Well worth the time and effort there are so many levels to attend take the camera. Staff very helpful and the environment is very calm. Dont rush the experience
,,Just go to Gardens by the Bay...,3.0,,You don't really need to pay to go into this pavilion. Just walk through the Gardens for free and watch the nightly light and sound show if you are on a limited budget.
,,Wonderous,4.0,,"Of the two exhibits next to each other in the Gardens on the Bay, this was our favourite. To get into both will cost 28 Singapore dollars but frankly it is worth every cent. The Cloud Forrest is a magical place, great for kids and adults alike. It recognises the dangers that we face with the environment and climate change. Places like this are good to visit because they show what we need to do to save the planet and at the same time appreciate how beautiful it can be."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"The forest was such a once in a life time experience. Now I have seen my fair share of forests in my life but never inside of enclosed building. The air was just so fresh and crisp, and the view from the top was worth every penny. (save you flight ticket to receive a 10% discount as well)"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It is worth going to see, Its amazing, beautiful. When we went it was quite busy people every were but worth it"
,,Nice escape from the heat,5.0,,"Big giant man made waterfall, the air is cool. Just nice to escape the outside heat. Bought the ticket at klook to escape the lines."
,,Cascading Plants,5.0,,Along with a visit to Gardens by the Bay a visit to the Cloud Forest is also highly recommended. The arrangement of the various plants hanging from the steel framed structure has been creatively carried out and the maintenance of these plants by dedicated staff suspended from ropes is breathtaking.
,,Highlights,5.0,,"It is one of a must visited place in singapore. The place ideal for a nature lovers and good for a scientific research. The dome is compose of 7 floor that you gonna take the stare to see the lost world but before that you need to take the elavetor till 6 floor. The place is will built, you can have a closer look with the waterfalls If you drop off on the viewing deck on your way down. Inside have a cyrstal hall which is amazing. The trail goes down was my favorite. We our ticket on the hostel we we’re staying a little less than the standard prize and the ticket good for flower dome and cloud dome visit. There are also a promotion offer to me feom booking.com but it required your credit card payment and also some ticket need to pick up in other location."
,,BEAUTIFUL & STUNNING,5.0,,"Beautiful and stunning place. There is a charge to get in but its worth it. Loads of beautiful trees, plants and flowers with waterfalls. Loads of photo opportunities and well worth a visit."
,,No way to miss,5.0,,"If you have just one day for Singapore come to Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, Supertree grove and Marina Sands bay. Enough!"
,,A must see,4.0,,Cloud forest also known as water forest will take tour breath away with its hidden floral gems.A staggering greenhouse like dome part of gardensby the bay. Rare plants can be found here.You could appreciate nature in its full wonders.
,,Experience mother nature,4.0,,A unique display of plants and trees of different climate. Good educational trip for the kids to learn and enjoy mother nature.
,,Amazing nature,5.0,,An amazing place especially for nature lovers. Was totally captivated at the entrance where one is greeted by the waterfall. Make sure that you go up all the way to the 6th floor for the treetop walkway. A place where one can wonder alone for hours just to absorb the beauty of the place. Highly recommended!
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Very interesting and plenty of space to accommodate lots of visitors. Somewhere to shelter from the thunderstorm that was going on outside. Got a great view of the lightning.
,,Splendid and mesmerizing!,5.0,,Just amazing and a must do while in Singapore and waterfall take your breath away and the climb and cloud are awesome. Start with the highest level by using lift and then walk down slowly to the ground.
,,WOW WOW WOW,5.0,,"WOW!!!! even my 5year old loved this forest and exploring all of the different flowers, learning how we can make a change."
,,Impressive,5.0,,A combined ticket for the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome can be bought just before entry. If you have your Airline boarding pass you will get a 10% discount. The Cloud Forrest is a huge building the houses multiple micro climates and features the worlds largest indoor waterfall. Keep to the left and take the elevator to the tops then work your way down to the bottom using the series of paths and bridges. Takes about and hour but you are welcome to stay longer. Thumbs up!
,,Really not worth all the money to go!,2.0,,"Thought this would be a good thing to go to in Singapore seen as though it’s got such good reviews however it’s really not! It gets that busy that you’re constantly pushing and shoving your way round, you cant take photos of anything, once inside you then have to queue for about 30 minutes to be able to go in the lift to the top! It’s mainly just a load of bushes within the dome and once you’re in you’re ready to get straight back out. Really not happy about wasting the money to go there..."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"We loved Cloud Forest, and we were amazed at how well put together it all is. The upkeep of this place must be amazing! Being able to see it all from higher levels as you climb up the stairs (or elevator if need be), is well worth it! Loved the wooden sculptures throughout."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The cloud dome is spectacular as soon as you walk through the front. You are greeted by the worlds tallest indoor waterfall and it doesn’t disappoint. Continue walking around the cool greenhouse and you will see amazing tropical plants, ferns, orchids and much more. You are surrounded by greenery throughout. There are surprises everywhere you look. Climb to the top of the tree walk and you feel like you are above the clouds when the spray mist tickles the foliage. This truly is a magnificent place and definitely worth a visit."
,,Impressive but overpriced,3.0,,"A very impressive place. Amazing to see such a huge waterfall indoors and all the plants they have grown around it are amazing. The idea of the walk way taking you so high in and around it are fantastic but is it worth the money - I don't think so.
Its very very crowded in there and although impressive, its all been set up to do this its just not the same as any natural waterfall.
I think the botanical gardens are much better, and they're free.
While I can see people still want to see this, definitely do not pay to go into the flower dome either its truly rubbish! Barely any plants in there when we visited and some random display of pumpkins. Once again the botanical gardens is better"
,,Oh my gosh - don't miss this!,5.0,,"What a beautiful job they have done on this place. This was the only one opened at the time of our visit, but this really blew us out of the water - just gorgeous! Amazing place! Loved Singapore!"
,,Experience,5.0,,"Walking in the first thing you see is the waterfall. It's spectacular housing abundance of plants. The second thing you see is the people around you with mouths open in awe.

Look for the Lego garden inside.

Well worth the small fee to enter and contribute to the upkeep.
Elevators and ramps take you to the levels to walk down. Some of the ramps are a little steep if in wheelchair on own.
Air-conditioned building.

Located past the skydome treetops in one of the two large white roof buildings. Buy ticket at front entrance of gardens by the bay."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Visited the cloud forest with my boyfriend after hearing good things about it and reading good reviews on here. Have to say after queuing for such a long time to purchase a ticket, then having to queue to present the ticket at the entrance, then having to queue again before the actual cloud forest we were expecting it to be a really good experience as it was obviously very popular. It’s pretty much impossible to take photos due to the amount of people walking around at once, pushing and shoving and standing so nobody can get past, and it’s all just to look at a waterfall, the cloud forest lasts for around 15-20 mins (and that’s only because of the amount of people you have to walk past) which in our opinion wasn’t worth the money we paid. We would say there are better things to spend your money on in Singapore."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you like nature and see a unique and beautiful display of flowers, plants water and some other natural displays this is a must see in Singapore. This was a fun stop and good way to get out of the heat. The pass of for 24 hours. I ended up going back to see it all again at night."
,,Building forest at city,5.0,,"I’m so impress with Cloud Forest. When I visit you need buy ticket at counter. Entrance so cold seems like forest, you will find waterfalls, all the plants from forest is here. You can explore more place for natural plan."
,,Eye Catching,4.0,,Cool and inviting place ! Easy to get around. Great place to escape to if it is hot and humid outside !
,,A Fantastic Spectical,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing. The indoor water fall and the Secret Garden are amazing. The whole thing is amazing, but the real winner is to get there during a misting time and feel like you are walking through the clouds. This is a must see.

If you have your Singapore Air boarding pass you'll get 10% off."
,,Cloud forest dome,4.0,,Amazing place. Well organised but so many people. The queues move quickly but be prepared to be pushed and shoved by tourists who don't understand the concept of patience.
,,Experience the rain forest and more!,5.0,,"Be prepared for the water fall just after entering the Cloud Forest, then wander and gaze in awe at the variety and diversity of your surroundings. Things you not only haven't seen before will meet your eye, but things never knew existed. Be prepared to take hundreds of pictures!"
,,My highlight,5.0,,"The most incredible thing in Singapore! Spectacular doesn't describe it well enough, definitely a must see. I'm scared of heights and wasn't a problem!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I think I read that this place has the tallest indoor waterfall; it is neat to see. The whole place is full of greenery and has the feeling of a cloud forest, but as if you are walking around it on the outside. We bought an admission that included the flower dome. The two together are definitely worth the price. There is a stalactite and stalagmite area that feels out of place to me. You will be high enough to have a interesting view of the surroundings. Try to arrive early; it attracts a lot of people."
,,WONDERFUL,4.0,,A nice place for a walk if you are interested in flora and fauna. Very beautiful to get to the top and walk the bridges far above the ground. Wonderful experience.
,,Cool Escape,4.0,,"Beautiful to see as part of our day out at Gardens by the Bay. And such a nice, cool respite from the heat."
,,Spectacular light and sound show,5.0,,"In a short break in Singapore we ran out of time to do the whole Gardens by the Bay experience, but managed to get to the evening light show in the Cloud Forest. It's a wonderful spectacle, very romantic, easy to get to and free! It lasts about half an hour and it's popular but there's plenty of space to wander around. Like fireworks, it's hard to photograph but I've done my best to give an impression of what it's like."
,,jungle,5.0,,"you can feel as in real jungle. waterfall was something amazing, plants, trees.... just fog every two hours wasn't so impressive as we expected"
,,Impressive!,5.0,,You have to be a nature lover to really appreciate its beauty! There's a wonderful collection of plants and flowers and the whole place is covered in greenary. Would definately recommend!
,,Stunning,4.0,,"A very impressive biodome. The scale has to be seen to be believed, it is vast and the density of the plants is incredible. Comfortable, even when busy."
,,Engage with nature,5.0,,"I love this place, since you reached Gardens By The Bay already or planning to visit because it’s a must. The place brings you close to nature and our Mother Earth, the falls are the best part of it’s a great place to take photos, you can climb up and enjoy the views of the forest, the place is indoor and temperature controlled so don’t worry about the weather.
Have Fun!"
,,"Terrific feat of engineering, and garden design",5.0,,"A great way to spend a couple of hours on a hot day, air con inside means it’s cool, probably cold for those from hot locales. Can get a little crowded and is a bit expensive for tourists, and doesn’t have the scenic beauty of the flower dome, but very well done, lots of greenery, some very impressive orchids and tons of greenery. You start high courtesy of a lift journey and send your way back down to ground level via walkways. All the time if you look outside the dome you get fantastic views of the Singapore skyline."
,,COOL!,4.0,,"It's a multi sensory experience, besides the cool, a bit of mist or ""wet"", ""height"" if you go to the top of the waterfall about 5-6 stories and walk down. Linger at the top where there is a small pond. The colors of tropical flowers and intense greens. At one point we caught a whiff of tropical humidity.
And then there is a hall of stalagmites.....a little out of place as there is not enough of cave, and dark atmosphere?
For my friend born in Singapore and raised in a big desert, he thought it was cool! It was- outside was 90 degrees F or mid 30s C....."
,,Incredible,4.0,,"The building itself is impressive but as you walk down from 7 floors up it is difficult to imagine just how many plants you are looking at. The waterfall is a spectacle by itself, information and explanation are well presented. A Singapore top site."
,,Feel like original forest,5.0,,Cloud forest is located in the garden by the bay so tourist take combo ticket with garden by the in this garden you may feel you are in forest and cloude are on your head shower are running . In this forest one of water fall and ponds that is vary nice. You may visit cloude Forest
,,Impressing,4.0,,"Impressing waterfall and lots of beautiful plants, but if you are most interested in botanics, you should rather go to Singapore Botanic Gardens."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"You really have to be into nature to get a ""WOW"" out of this. Im not that into trees, flowers ect ect, but did find this interesting enough to want to visit"
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,"A nice place for a walk if you are interested in plants and flowers. Very beautiful to get to the top and walk the bridges far above the ground. Temperature inside is cool, so a nice break from the heat outside. Only downside is the price at 16 SGD"
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,"As you enter, you’re greeted by a lovely tall waterfall, with the spray very refreshing after the heat outside. We spent over an hour walking around the whole dome. Some beautiful flowers and plants all around you and be warned, the walkway does go very high into the roof of the dome. A nice experience overall."
,,Really amazing,5.0,,"A really unique experience. I wasn't sure what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised. A great way to spend a few hours. Fascinating flowers and plants, and the waterfalls were great for creating a cooling mist."
,,Most Amazing!,5.0,,"This dome wins the prize for the must see in the Gardens by the Bay complex. Wonderful collection of plants and flowers, beautifully presented. Worth every penny!"
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"I really enjoyed this attraction even though I am afraid of heights. I went all the way up, but needed to take the elevator after the 6th floor. Still enjoyed it a lot."
,,This really is something different.,5.0,,The interesting thing thing is you get into a lift in the centre of the mound to the top then walk down on various walkways. All in an air con environment. A very unique experience.
,,1 out of 2,5.0,,"Good to visit, must go if you are visiting the flower dome as they are part of the same facility but with different charges."
,,"Impressive, futuristic horticultural space",5.0,,"The first thing that greets you as you enter the huge glass dome is the artificial waterfall that drops about eight stories to ground level. An elevator takes you up to the top of the structure from where you follow a suspended walkway that descends corkscrew fashion around the exterior of the huge central structure which has been planted with a profusion off plants, flowers, climbers etc.

I don’t know if it is a unique structure but it is certainly the only one that I’ve ever seen. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Neat place,5.0,,Actually I have read some mixed reviews about this place but I thought it was quite enjoyable. The plants are extremely well cared for and a lot of work has gone into planning which plants will be placed in which place. If you're into bought me at all or gardening I think he would quite like this place. It is not expensive to enter and if you want to add on the Floral Garden side it's a very inexpensive add on to your ticket. Makes for a nice day.
,,Wow,5.0,,I'm impressed with how people make this magical place. I can't wait to visit this place again with my little brother next time

,,"Again, excellent",5.0,,"It can be chilly and is definitely wet, due to the constant water mist. Great for the really active. You can easily spend an hour or more, just in this Dome, which is called the Cloud Dome."
,,Mesmerizing experience,5.0,,"Like walking through the most amazing garden, with sculptures and carvings set amongst all the beautiful flora on display. A must for lovers of Orchids!!"
,,Refreshing.,3.0,,"I visited the cloud forest on a hot and stuffy day, as soon as you enter and the waterfall hits your view it's amazing.

The gardens are cooler than the outside and there is a lot to view and also a lot to take in about environment change.

All in all a good experience."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"This was a great way to escape the busy city, down pouring rain, and heat. It was fascinating to walk around. I might not do it again, but it is definitely worth a one time trip!"
,,Amazing rain forest greenhouse!,5.0,,"This is one of the so-called ""conservatories"" that you'll find at Singapore's ""Gardens by the Bay."" The other one would be the ""Flower Dome."" While the latter is more focused on flowers, this one is more focused on tropical and rain forest vegetation. It also has an amazing 35-meter high waterfall inside! Don't miss the Cloud Walk and the Treetop Walk! Also check out the mist timings and the schedule of the projection of documentaries.

A visit to the place is highly recommended. It really feels like you are immersed in a lush rain forest! The place is open from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Entrance fee is for both conservatories costs only SG$28 for adults (with special discounts for senior citizens, children and Singaporeans)."
,,Well worth spending a couple of hours,5.0,,Absolutely worth a visit. At the same time visit the Flowe dome. But we preferred the Cloud Forrest If you don’t have time to visit both. Fantastic creation with all type of vegetation. Should come back if I come visit Singapore again.
,,Experience a mountain in the heart of the city,5.0,,It was a nice experience. Breathing a fresh mountain air inside and they also have a waterfall man made. Someone who are afraid of height needs to be careful walking all the way to the top.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This is a must see for any visitors to Singapore. It is incredible and well worth the money. Don't use the Bakerzin restaurant located next to the Dome. It is terrible.
,,A chance to see plants that you could never normally see!,5.0,,"This was very interesting, and a dynamic way of teaching about conservation. It would be hopeless if you had a fear of heights! It is an amazingly creative place with so much to learn about, it is well worth visiting."
,,Wonderfull world of rain forrest in the Bay,5.0,,"Really fabulous experience and great value. Also on a really hot day it's a great way to enjoy some relief from the Singapore sun, which in the middle of the day is really intense. Walking through the rain forrest at different levels is magical."
,,Amazing,5.0,,What an incredible place something from another world if you are in Singapore don't miss seeing this
,,Loved this!,5.0,,"This was a beautiful experience and so much more extensive than I realised it would be. So nice and cool inside, beautiful flowers and greenery."
,,Excellent forest kingdom,5.0,,Great place to follow the flower dome. The Waterfall is spectacular and the corkscrew path down provides a number of photo opportunities.
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,Worth Going to Cloud forest harbors lots of variety of plants and beautifully designed. Do take a stroller if you are traveling with kid.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"One of the things you must visit when in Singapore! I suggest also to go there at night, the view is fabulous."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"A must visit when in Singapore! Well worth the money, the walkways are fantastic, if you have an interest in plants it must not be missed"
,,"If you're choosing one thing to see at Gardens by the Bay, go with the Cloud Forest",5.0,,"Really one of the most remarkable feats of cityscape-building — you could call it ""civic magic,"" the crown jewel of an authoritarian government that has made the daily slog of authoritarianism for its citizens disappear with malls and beautiful light shows (which you should definitely see nightly at the Supertrees next door!)"
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,"There are two domes and it is worth seeing both. They are amazing inside and worth the entrance fee. Part of the gardens, which are free to walk around but well worth paying to go into the domes."
,,Stunning,4.0,,"The cloud forest is stunning, dominated by a huge water feature that you go to the top of and then walk back down on walkways circling it. It is very busy in the early evening though and you are constantly having to avoid those just stopping in the middle of walkways to take selfies and pictures."
,,Simply the most beautiful place I have ever been.,5.0,,"No photos give back the feeling when you step into this wonderland, and feel like in a dream. I can only recomend to see Cloud Forrest, even if you have time for one attraction only."
,,Beautiful and Natural Feel,4.0,,"Artistically Done. Nice Stroll inside. Very Cold there, be sure to get your jackets on. Forest glimpses from various continents and regions."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"The climate control and man-made fountain are amazing. You ascend through clouds of mist rich with ferns and orchids and then descend through the central structure to the exit where there are video presentations about nature and how we must preserve the earth. Nearly made me cry, it was so evocative."
,,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"This in my opinion is the best site in Singapore.

The 4 story waterfall at the beginning takes your breath away. The flowers and gardens are beautiful.

Be sure to use the elevators to go to both the top and mid range sky way passages. They give a different perspective or a new look to an exciting site.

Do this after the Flower Dome for maximum enjoyment from both."
,,Overhyped!,1.0,,When we got in the misting was is progress. They have a so called waterfall which is more like a tap left open. I would rather spend time in orchid garden than here.
,,Good effort,4.0,,"This is a good effort to make people aware of global warming and also detail them about the eco systems.
Singapore is on the equator and has a rich foliage as it is so this is an extra bonus , It is crowded at times and the photo ops are many ."
,,worth to see,5.0,,"amazing water fall. pathways are well design. be aware the cool air inside, especially over 30 degree outside."
,,Truly Spectacular,5.0,,"This is in the true sense a man-made wonder, so much bio diversify, all the flora mesmerise you. Definitely after visiting this, one will have more regards for mother nature."
,,Mesmerized,4.0,,The waterfall was amazing when our walk into this place! It was so cool to walk on the walkway and look down at the waterfall! You can take pictures of the Marina Bay sands from there!
,,Must visit,5.0,,What a great place to visit. Unbelievable plant growth and spectacular indoor waterfall. Need. Head for heights as you get to go to the top of the dome
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Such a beautiful experience, cold inside the dome which was a nice getaway from the humid temp outside. We done this with a double stroller"
,,The best glass house,5.0,,"This was my favoirte glass house in the Gardens - some where between Jurasic Park and Avitar - giant ferns, misty waterfalls - a trek through the jungle. Great fun - somehting different"
,,Superb,5.0,,"Just don't miss this is part of Gardens by the Bay. Please visit and keen 2 hours for this alone! You can walk around this place without any problem. You can go even on daytime, (even under hot sun) because this place is covered by glass roof"
,,Mist is fun but not jaw dropping,4.0,,This is a good adventure for the day and interesting but im not sure kids would love it and it seems more like a nice way to escape the heat rather than a top attraction. It looks like it is going to be better than it is but its still worth a visit if you have some time to spare in the area
,,Tourist Trap,2.0,,So okay we need to be reminded of the beautiful plants and flowers there is and that we have to take care of them (and the world). But do we have to pay 16 dollars to queue to the top of the inside of a giant greenhouse in order to do so? Then we walked amongst hordes of tourists photographing each other down through the greenhouse. Occasionally we got a glimpse of the flowers...On the way out we encountered numberous sad messages and pictures of our troubled world. But to cheer us up we had to pass through the shop to buy souvenirs. One wonders what the meaning of all this really is?
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Beautiful sightseeing place! One of the best sightseeing places I have seen in my life. Easy to find and many gift shops, sightseeing places and restaurants close by."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing massive dome show casing what a rain forest amongst the clouds look like. From the huge six storey waterfall at the entrance you take a lift to the top to then descend along the walkways. Hold on to your hat and sunnies when looking down.
Allow at least 30 to 45 minutes for a leisurely walk around."
,,Worth every penny,5.0,,"Man made spectacular mountain covered with plants from different corner of the world, the waterfall, escape from the heat..oh I can't express that feeling with my words...
when entered in the ground floor,i see the view of the waterfall,i just said wow... also because of the atmosphere inside.. just came there after few minutes of walk in the marina bay area,was feeling a little bit hot,then i didn't expect,it just refreshed all of me like a charm.. excellent weather to enjoy the spectacular views..a must visit for all who travelling Singapore...of course I want to go there as many time I can.."
,,Just beautiful!,5.0,,Stunning planting and amazing to be able to walk up the walkways and see the plants up close. Wonderful to be in there at misting time
,,A must see place,5.0,,Definitely a place to visit. Get ready to get wet but only a bit at the entrance. It is so beautiful and educational with all different type of plants and the way they are displayed and planted nicely.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One of the two domes in the Gardens by the bay. An amazing design, allowing people to fully embrace the nature, by slowly descending from the top of the dome, going through the different climatic zones and different periods in Earth's history. You need to allocate at least 40 minutes for a slow walk around to fully enjoy what this attraction has to offer."
,,Family,5.0,,My favourite & first stop for visitors. An ever changing landscape & a wonderful escape from Singapore’s heat.
,,Keep going back!,5.0,,"Have visited about 4 times already, with friends and as part a couple, and never tire of Cloud Forest. The sight of the waterfall when you first walk in is always breathtaking. There are so many photo opportunities and I love how the walkways give you such close access to the waterfall and surrounding foliage. It’s a relaxing yet invigorating place at the same time. Easy to get to on MRT and a simple stroll through the magnificent Gardens by the Bay."
,,Unique,4.0,,"An artificial mountain with a waterfall, covered in vertical plants depicting different climate zones. I don't think there is too much like it elsewhere int he world, so worth a visit. However, unless you are into botany/environmentalism in a big way, one visit would be enough. The misting that occurs regularly at the higher levels can make for interesting photographs if you time it right."
,,Stunning,4.0,,"really enjoyed my visit here, timed it for late arvo evening and really enjoyed the visit. Better eating facilities nearby would have improved the experience"
,,walk in the cloud,5.0,,man made Water fall excellent walking through the garden from top to lower level a great experience Mist experience was very good a chill place inside the garden Overall a Great place in SG
,,Must visit,5.0,,The place was beautiful. Felt like going into a real forest. The waterfall views are amazing. They make it foggy once in every 2 hours. Watch for the time and go during when they are foggy.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This place features the largest indoor waterfall in the world. You can take escalators or a lift to the top and walk down through the various plant zones. It is awesome . Try and see it at night when it is illuminated
,,"Just a stroll in the park, Kazanski",5.0,,Outstanding. Not to be missed if you've taken the trouble to go down to the bay area to see the MBS and Gardens by the Bay. Stay awhile afterwards to enjoy the nightly light display in the gardens then wander over to Satay by the Bay to sample some of Singapore's favourite fare at an inexpensive open-air venue.
,,No fun but educational,4.0,,It was no fun visiting cloud forest but same time we gain lot of knowledge about environment and other things.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Well worth a visit while in the Marina Bay area. The waterfall is spectacular and it’s a great way to cool down from the humid Singapore atmosphere.
,,Interesting but a bit average,3.0,,"We found this interesting but not great to be honest, nice and cool. Not cheap and whilst cool inside its a bit hot walking about."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The structure is amazing. When the misting occurs it is like being at the top of a mountain in the mist. All the vegetation is vibrant.
,,Nice place to spend 90 minutes,5.0,,This is an unusual place with a lot to see and experience. It's also nice and cool - a great respite from the heat in Singapore.
,,Interesting but not exciting.,3.0,,"We didn't go here expecting any great thrills as such and probably would of left it to my 3rd visit to Singapore with my kids.
It is really well done and very pretty but if you have teens, my advice would be make sure you do Sentosa properly first."
,,Impressed,5.0,,"I'm not one for artificial forests, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this cloud forest (as well as the flower dome). There's a waterfall in here, and the cool temperature provides a good respite from the sweltering heat!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Tropical greenery, art work and an artificial indoor waterfall. All this in the protection of a huge glass dome. Scenery all around includes Marina Bay Sands and the Super tree Grove. Being indoors helps in Singapore's rainy climate."
,,It's all about the waterfall,5.0,,There's nothing like getting out of the hot Singaporean sun and getting blasted my the cool air in the cloud forest while the water from the waterfall sprinkles u. It's so refreshing and u can view it from multiple levels. There are plenty of flowers u can snap pictures of too.
,,WOW!,5.0,,This is an amazing adventure. A 35m high mountain and waterfall inside the greenhouse. The plants are immaculate and plentiful. The whole place is amazing and very clean and tidy....and reasonably priced
,,Gorgeous!,5.0,,"So pretty so cool! Awesome plants!
Definitely worth seeing.
Nice to go there during the sunset.
Tickets are sold right when u get off the MRTsubway station. Then there is a shuttle to bring u to the entrance.
Definitely expect to spend 1 hr or more there!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This place is beautiful. So well maintained, loads to see, do and learn. Really enjoyed my visit here"
,,Creative method to communicate a serious issue,4.0,,The forest is a innovative way to highlight how important the ecosystems of the world our for human habitation to occur. It is a enjoyable late afternoon early evening activity with much to consider.
,,This is the best of the 2 domes to see,5.0,,"There is 2 domes for the 1 ticket you pay for and this one was the best of the 2 of them!
If you love greenery, flowers, & exotic flowers then you'll LOVE this place. I didn't expect how big the 2 domes were. One was larger (Cloud Forest) than the other. I haven't been in many around the world but this is definitely #1 on my list. So beautiful. You can go at your own pace...but depending on how quickly you go thru maybe 1.5-2.5 hour+ total for both indoor domes. It is cool in there so bring a light cardigan/sweater if you're cold by nature....Thank goodness I did. At first I thought the $28 SGD was a bit much but I think it's ok seeing how extensive it is."
,,Impressive!,5.0,,Such an impressive man made cloud forest under the dome. A definite must to do while in Singapore. Get the combo ticket to visit the flower dome as well.
,,Singapore's Surreal Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay is up there with Singapore’s most impressive local attraction.

This staggering greenhouse-like glass dome can be seen from miles away from its Marina Bay precinct itself, with stunning views in every direction.

It's built together with Flower Dome, also makes up the pair of giant man-made structures, but it is the larger, climate-controlled Cloud Forest that attracts the most visitors with its jaw-dropping architecture, spiralling walkways from the top and the world’s tallest indoor waterfall that rains down from over 100 feet above.

It features a range of plants from Mediterranean, Australian, South American and South African regions."
,,Very coo,4.0,,"Very cool! Recommend going in the morning when there’s not many people around, although it is quite pricey. Perfect if there’s a rain"
,,Only in Singapore,5.0,,"Didn't know what to expect but it certainly wasn't this. Just amazing. A huge circular structure in the centre of the dome. There is a set of escalators on the inside of the concrete structure that takes you to the top & then you make your way down along a series of walkways through & around gardens attached to the concrete structure. There are overhanging walkways around the outside of the dome as well as a few waterfalls. Green, lush, tropical & humid, but extremely beautiful & extraordinarily different. Worth a visit."
,,Great way to escape the heat,4.0,,"Pretty cool to experience the worlds largest indoor waterfall Can't say its the most exciting experience but def worth a look, shame the residents and visitors are charged different prices"
,,A great attraction!,5.0,,"This was one of the best attractions in Singapore. I didn’t know what to expect but was more than pleasantly surprised.

You must go see this for the wonderful views, the amazing mountain filled with plants and to escape the heat.

I would suggest going an hour before sunset so you can get to the bridge and see the sunset.

After this go to the flower dome. Also another fantastic attraction."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Main entrance of cloud forest is awesome, it was really mind blowing.... a perfect photo pic location"
,,beautiful garden,4.0,,This is a part of gardens by the bay .There is amazing collection of plants from different geographical regions.The layout is good and one can easily spend an hour or so here.
,,Amazing indoor waterfall,5.0,,Indoor waterfall and fantastic greenery inside this dome in the Gardens by the Bay. Definitely worth a visit
,,Fantastic forest!,4.0,,"Located in-house in a building in the Garden of the bay in Singapore. A 40 m high mountain inside-covered with trees,bushes and flowers. There is also a waterfall covering the mountain. Absolutely worth a visit."
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,An amazing way to spend a couple of days. It is easy to get to. Family friendly and the cost is reasonable. Words can not describe the beauty.
,,Up in the clouds,5.0,,Amazing almost extraterrestrial landscape theme with wonderful sky bridges to walk on and admire the beauty of hanging tropical foliage and flowers display.
,,Wonderous,5.0,,You have to see this place to believe it. It has the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. The variety of foliage is remarkable. The succulents alone are stunning. Also tucked into the greenery are the best statues. We loved this place.
,,Surreal and great time with family,5.0,,This is a wonderful greenhouse emulating a vibrant tropical rain / cloud forest ... There is massive artificial waterfall that provides and amazing view and great (slightly wet!) experience. The tropical collection is something extraordinary. The wait times to the lift to take you to the top could be high during evenings and holidays. The wait is really worth it and really provides and amazing experience of a typical cloud forests common in SE Asia and other tropics.
,,unique observatory,5.0,,"If you buy one observatory ticket, then you can choose one between this and another. I haven't visited another, but I think this one is better with various settings. It's not just simple botanic garden, but filled with lots of fun stuff you might enjoy.."
,,Really cool,5.0,,"It is a bit humid outside in December in Singapore. So it is really a nice place to visit and enjoy the beautiful flowers, water falls etc."
,,Synthetic sanctuary,4.0,,"This man-made forest, built to house an impressive collection of curated plants, isn’t an escape from the city, but a unique green urban area free of pollution.

The site offers a large variety of activities and dining offered under a mainstream appeal.

As far as greenery goes in Singapore, this a tip top!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,This place is worth the entry fee.. its awesome. Huge indoor mountain and waterfall. Lots of informative stuff to do and see.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Part of the gardens at the Gardens by the Bay complex, the Cloud Forest is an atrium including a huge waterfall, alpine flora and many high altitude ramps.
Value: There is a fee (S$28) for this and the other atrium at the complex.
Amenities: Gift shop and toilets.
Accessability: Elevators and ramps make this an easy to navigate experience. The ramps can be rocky, especially when lots of families are moving around to get the perfect group photo."
,,The best part of the Bay,5.0,,"This area is just outstanding. The mountain of plants so lovingly planted just has to be admired. The misting is worth waiting for. We saw this at midday but I think it’s every 2 hours. We went on twice so we could ensure we saw the waterfall from above, below and all around."
,,City best garden,4.0,,"Its good eye opener to see how can be such a big gardens with well organised built such a way in the city. Some plants, trees we haven’t seen before, many have in our home land. But how its arranged between plants, flowers, trees, vegetation etc is nicely done. Good for a short walk with family."
,,Beautiful recreation of natural,5.0,,"When in Singapore, a visit to the Cloud Forest is a must. A thoughtful built conservatory, with ample light and beautiful specimens of flora. It is a charming culmination of the manmade and the natural. The dome and walkways are designed to offer amazing viewpoints of the conservatory. It is a good place for kids and recommended for all age groups.
I preferred this place over the Flower Dome next door. Cloud forest has a different charm and seems surreal at times (especially, when they release the mist in the air)."
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore!,5.0,,This is such a charming and wonderful place to spend quality time in Singapore. Indoor waterfall is amazing and it is the biggest indoor waterfall. It is very cold and misty inside the cloud forest. It is like we are in a real rain forest and you don't feel that this is situated inside a concrete jungle.
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,The design and layout of cloud forest gives a lot. So much to explore and keep your interest piqued at all times. Worth the visit and cost. Highly recommend and a must-see!
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Amazing cooler damp climate inside this huge glasshouse, recreating forests at 2000ft altitude. Huge specimen trees and other flora."
,,Excelent,5.0,,"This cloud forest is taking us into the next level of the forest in the middle of city. When i were there, i felt l the middle of rain forest with a rainfall as source of water. I truly like it very much."
,,Awesome..,5.0,,"Amazing experience. Biggest indoor waterfall, mystetious world of tropical vegetation ...Must visit."
,,Stunning Trees and landscape at many levels - and views from the top,5.0,,"Stunning Trees and landscape at many levels - and views from the top. Part of the gardens by the Bay. We paid for the two domes experience, Flowers and Cloud Forest Domes"
,,Dreaming visit place,5.0,,Falling in love at this such a wonderful place on earth. It's worth to visit this place when you are in Singapore. Done the check-list
,,Marvellous,5.0,,It was great to visit this extraordinary place green and frsh in a so modern city a lot of flowers with fantastic colours we really enjoy it was thesecond time we went there it was really super you have to do it
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"We spent half a day in here and the nearby restaurant,the tallest indoor waterfall and once an hour the whole dome is shrouded in mist as you would find in any rainforest.to top it all there's a film on global warming which brings everything home"
,,Mind blowing!,5.0,,"This was on our To Do List since previous trips to Singapore, but this January 2018, we had tickets to go inside and it did not disappoint!

We went in the early evening when it was still light but the sun was slowly setting, thus avoiding the heat and experiencing the Cloud Forest as the lights began to illuminate.

It was extremely busy with massive long queues to see the man-made waterfall. Give yourself sufficient time, not only to experience but also to account for the rest of the world who are wanting to see it simultaneously also."
,,Amazing indoor greenhouse,4.0,,Spectacular greenhouse with amazing waterfalls. It is also a nice way to cool off. If you are an engineer like me you will appeciate the structure also
,,Such a lovely place,5.0,,I've immensely enjoyed my visit to the Cloud Forest. It is an impressive and unique place. I think it would be interesting even for those who don't care much about plants.
,,Technically brilliant.,5.0,,"Whoever conceived of this huge dome clearly had some imagination. Whilst it's possible to see the same trees and plants in other glass houses (think Kew Gardens) this space uses height to convey the phenomenon of different plants that thrive at different levels of the cloud forest. The waterfall and walkways are very impressive and whilst it doesn't take as long to walk through this dome as the flower dome it was worth the price of the double ticket to visit both.
One exhibit did concern me and that was the collection of huge stalactites and stalagmites which were said to have come from Malaysia. To remove them from their caves, where they take centuries to grow, struck me as vandalism."
,,So many trees plants under one roof,4.0,,Singaporeans must be proud of this amazing park. When you enter you will see a big waterfall. You can climb up by lift and then talk a walk down. It's like roaming in a forest.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Particularly interesting are the tallest artificial waterfall & the Short Film on Global warming which features the 6th Mass extinction in the geological history of our planet -currently underway
,,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful",5.0,,"You enter a whole new world as you step into the Cloud Forest. Starting at the top you meander downwards through lush tropical rain forest with real clouds up in the canopy, waterfalls and stunning foliage. This is something very special indeed"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Visited the Cloud Dome about 5pm after walking through the gorgous gardens. The way it has been designed is amazing. We spent about 1 half hours there. If visiting Singapore i would highly recommend.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"It was amazing and so lush and green so many people in the forest but one didn;t feel crowded, the statues were different but very enjoyable experience"
,,A day in the clouds,5.0,,We needed somewhere active an interesting to share with the kids prior to heading to the airport. The location of the accessibility and cost of the exhibition made this a great way to finish our time in Singapore. My kids (and us) were amazed at what had been built and the opportunity to see so many rare species in their natural environment. My 11 year old son read every information station and walked away amazed at what nature has to offer. The proximity to the satay club for cheap meals and a variety of other attractions makes this a must see for all families
,,One of the MUST things to do in singapore,5.0,,"The picture don't do it justice, it really is a wonderful experience and caters to everyone and is also accessible for people with prams or wheelchairs which is great !"
,,Surprisingly wonderful,5.0,,Don’t skip this place. Spend three hours. Water fall is good. Have a light clothing. Don’t waste time spending in museum. They will crate artificial clouds. U should be lucky to watch it as they won’t release clouds continuously.
,,Cloud forest is a dreamland,5.0,,A must see stop whenever in Singapore! When planning your visit try and plan it around the misting times (around every 2 hours) least this way you get to see the cloud form around the plantation. Added bonus to your ticket is that you can get a re entry stamp so you can go back in the evening for free and see it all lit up! Winner winner! Definitely a recommended place to visit for all ages!
,,Amazing,4.0,,Spent a relaxed couple of hours enjoying all the different displays as we made our way through. Something for all ages
,,Must see,5.0,,Been in the Garden at the Beach now three times every year we discover new places in the garden. Plan for at least half a day ...
,,beautiful!,5.0,,Great architectural and botanic experience! Had no problem with lines or so. Shops also worth a visit!
,,OH what a sight to view,5.0,,"Excellent, brilliant, breath taking views. Worth the money and time. worth the trip - A must see when in Signapore"
,,Must-see in Singapore.,5.0,,"We visited this attraction twice, and every time we were amazed by what was achieved inside this facility. It's much bigger than you can estimate from photo's, and the organisation of visitors is as such that it never feels crowded or allow for people to bump into each other. You go up to the highest level with a lift, then descend slowly by walking down the foot bridge. From all angles one then has a multiplicity of views for photography. It's air-conditioned, and provides a welcome relieve from the walk there in the heat and high humidity."
,,superb,4.0,,absolutely stunning structure that can only get better as the gardens mature highly recommended for young and old
,,Always a joy to visit,5.0,,Head to the cloud forest located at Gardens by the Bay if you need a bit of respite from the tropical heat. Excellent surrounding and a joy to visit.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was different. The highest indoor waterfall. It was huge and reached firstly by a lift then by a walk way that went up and round the dome. Although a lot of visitors you didn't feel squashed and plenty of room to walk around for views and photos. Staff very helpful.
,,Singapore must do,5.0,,"Went here with wife and two teenage kids. Spectacular site. The high walks were not for the faint hearted. Waterfall was amazing. If you are coming from Marina Bay Sands, get the shuttle bus for $SDG 3, worth the wait not to walk in the Singapore heat."
,,Magical,5.0,,Went there during dusk. The place became beautiful with the change if light. The waterfall is amazing and the walk down over the bridges snd stair provided excellent views and information. Must do.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"This was a great experience. The waterfall was amazing and the plants and flowers were gorgeous. There were even flowers made out of lego, stalactites and stalagmites the best were the carnivorous pitcher plants!"
,,Well designed garden,5.0,,A great place to include on a visit to gardens by the bay. Escape the heat or a rain shower and see the spectacular indoor waterfall. It’s worth the entry fee! The place is designed to take you all around the different levels of the forest all while educating you about the unique ecosystem that the cloud forest is. I spent about an hour here.
,,Fasinating and Cool,5.0,,Recommended for everyone to experience the beauty and man-made waterfall....the wild plants and beautiful flowers...I love the coldness thou not that so cold....For my view....requested more colder like we are experiencing the surrounding with fresh and cooling air inside the Cloud Forest
,,Tourist in my own country,4.0,,"It's beautiful and amazing. The flowers, waterfall, walking trail and soo much to learn. I visited in the evening but would love to go again in the morning to check out the beauty of the place."
,,Shame about the queues,4.0,,"Maybe going at 4pm on Christmas Eve wasn't the best idea but the queues were quite annoying. You queue for a ticket, and then get in another queue, and then another it seems and then another! It's a very impressive structure and a nice oasis from the city but try to go early morning to avoid the crowds. Also, if you don't like heights, I would avoid! I didn't realise this until I was on the skywalk!"
,,lovely place,5.0,,"Well worth the visit. Another one of Singapores innovative attractions. Make sure you go mid afternoon so you can visit the flower dome and the light show with the giant trees which starts at 7:45pm. Viewing from the Skydeck is great, but get your ticet early as there was still a long queue when the show commenced."
,,Adventure trip.,5.0,,Awesome place whatever the weather. So much to see and do well worth the trip refreshments are available and comfortable place to stroll round at your own pace. I really recommend a visit.
,,Absolutely Amazing,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore you absolutely must find time to visit the Cloud Forest. With the world's highest indoor waterfall and a skywalk that is beyond belief, you won't be disappointed. The foliage is absolutely amazing! Do not miss this tourist stop!!!"
,,Dizzying beauty,5.0,,The sheer scale and beauty of this garden is a wonder to behold. The sky walk and treetop walk are a must do activity when visiting this garden Attraction
,,Got to be seen to be believed,5.0,,"You need to spend a minimum of 45 mins in this place as it's just amazing. Combine it with the Flower Dome for a superb Singapore experience. I went at night which gave if a really amazing atmosphere as there is lighting. However, the lighting is not strong enough to light everything so going at sunset would allow you the best of both worlds."
,,"Manmade garden, nothing spectacular",4.0,,"I am a lover of nature so for those like me, i would recommend going to Singapore botanic garden instead."
,,beautiful tropical,5.0,,The cloud forest has trees and flowers of all sorts rising high into the sky inside a dome. Plenty of photo ops. They do have easy wheelchair access
,,One of the best attractions in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Don't miss the Cloud Forest if you're visiting the wonderful attraction that is Gardens by the Bay. This massive indoor feature, with its tumbling waterfall, will provide the 'feel' of a rainforest without the risky wildlife! Then, as you work your way higher, the Singapore skyline with its 21st Century feel of modern efficiency will contrast even more against your feel of communing with nature. Go for it!"
,,Awesome !!!,5.0,,We were gob smacked by the size and the overall lushness of the vegetation . A m.ust see presentation
,,Architecturally and Botanically Interesting,5.0,,The Domes have great walks around a variety of interesting plants and sculptures. You have an added bonus of cooling down from the outside heat too!
,,masmerizing,5.0,,"YOu will never regret visiting. an excellent way to relax and breath. Though it's a man made beauty, but worth a visit. walking around those waterfalls in every level was something to remember. Truly amazing."
,,Incredible and a great way to cool off!,5.0,,"The whole family (children aged 5,9&9) enjoyed this. The lovely range of flowers and the jutting out walkways were amazing. Highly recommend it."
,,A great man made structure,5.0,,This is a great example of what money can do when spend by intelligent people! I fully recommend it to families with children visiting Singapore.
,,Tropical Rain Forest,3.0,,"Impressive but ....Where have all the flowers gone? Well, it was supposed to be a tropical rain forest but why do they keep it at such a low temperature? I'm no expert but I think tropical flowers need more heat. They had to make the venus fly trap out of Lego!"
,,Lovely Uphill Walk ..,5.0,,This was out of the blue .. Just being on the top was giving a feel of true nature .. Beautifully designed and crafted and not to mention the maintenance which is top notch ..
,,Best experience in any garden ever visited,5.0,,"Beautiful artificial creation, this is not a natural habitat like a national park, however, beautifully created a four story vertical garden with all time moist atmosphere under an amazing semi spherical dome. Must visit while you are in Singapore"
,,Awesome Attraction!,5.0,,"This was definitely worth the visit. If you have the chance make sure you check out the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. If you purchase the admissions tickets together it'll be cheaper.

This was a great way to get out of the heat and see something really cool. Between the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, you can spend a few hours between the two. This is also a great place to bring children. There is plenty of space for them to run around and explore. We came here during a weekday so it was not that busy. But I have heard that this place will get crowded during weekends and peak holidays.

Be sure to wear comfortable shoes that are slip resistant. The ground does get wet. There are places where the floor will be slippery so be careful."
,,A full day activity,4.0,,the 2 domes and the super tree grove will easily occupy a full day- worth seeing in day and night time
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"If you only have a limited time in Singapore (and have had enough of the heat), you must visit the Cloud Forest. It's spectacularly beautiful in there and the climate the plants have to be kept at is cool and comfortable."
,,Little jungle,5.0,,"Interesting place for all kind of travelers! Especially people who are into nature! It is a little cool there, but climbing the uphill path will warm you up!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Walking into the Cloud Forest and seeing the waterfall was spectacular. We really enjoyed walking around, looking at all of the plants and also earning more about what Gardens by the Bay do.
We were pleasantly surprised (but extremely happy!) that the Cloud Forest had air conditioning so provided some relief to the hot weather outside.
It wasn't too busy inside when we went, but a steady stream of people. It was a Monday around midday so maybe that's a quieter time."
,,"A uniqe, amazing garden experience",5.0,,"I was suitably skeptical as I do like my gardens, but this place is so worth the visit and its impressive ranking. This huge conservatory is chock full of tropical plants in an amazing jungle setting based on an artificial mountain with multiple catwalks and a big waterfall. What I find most impressive is the way the designers have inserted tonnes of sculptures and other pieces, even lego, but in a very tasteful way, which really breaks up the natural garden aspects without detracting from it being a living garden. This one of those attractions I would do again. Which is saying something. Al at 'leavetoroam.com'."
,,Gardens,4.0,,"We took the audio tour around the gardens, I would recommend this as you learn so much and see all the main areas, $8 pp and you’ll end up at the Pavillions . Then you buy those tickets, For me Cloud Forest was great, When you get to the top you walk on a wire/ metal walkway to the bottom, water misters working, beautiful, I loved the Secret Garden at the end"
,,Amazing engineered vertical garden,4.0,,from the first internal view the size of the forest is spectacular. The lift takes you up and then you walk down in and around the forest.
,,A great way to spend a day in Singapore,4.0,,"We had a day to kill in Singapore and we enjoyed spending half of it here. Lots of beautiful plants and scenery. Also much hiking if you want it,"
,,"Awesome waterfall, cool inside and very well done",5.0,,"Loved the cool air conditioning on a hot day in Singapore, loved the waterfall and all the fauna from around the world. A lift up to the top and then walking the walkways down was a lovely way to do it."
,,You should check out the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"If you find yourself in Singapore at Gardens by the Bay and can only do one thing, make it the Cloud Forest. This was way more engaging than the Flower Dome (in my opinion). The signage and information is great and the Cloud Forest provides opportunities to get a great view of Singapore from a high vantage point. We didn’t make it for the “misting” that happens twice daily, but I imagine this would be really cool to see."
,,Loved it,4.0,,Really beautiful. You can walk around the bottom before getting in a lift to the very top. Fromt here you make your way down each level as each offers something different. The top level is a cloud walk that allows you to see everything. Another level talks about stalagmites and stalactites. It also contains a gallery and theatre which you can quickly walk through if you aren't that interested.
,,Thick green forest with in the city,5.0,,"Stunning is the word. Salute the man behind the idea, the planners and those who worked on it If you dont go there your visit to Singapore is absolutely incomplete. Didn't want to put the pictures but put two just to tell you how great it is"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Always a delightful experience! The trail going to the top was very satisfying. You get more of what you paid for.
,,A must see. Better than the Flower Dome,5.0,,"I visited the both on Christmas Day an extremely hot day and I began to regret visiting it. But as soon as I got off the shuttle[3 SD for unlimted rides the whole day but only to the CF and the entrance] and entered the dome it was heavenly. The huge waterfall they've created takes your breath away as soon as you enter. You also have excellent views of Singapore from upper levels.

The CF is located over many levels and is packed with plants and flowers, all shrouded in a mist they create. There is a huge walkway overhanging the waterfall which is incredible and a little balcony you can climb onto that makes you feel you're in the waterfall.

I would give the Flower Dome a miss and do just the Cloud Forest."
,,Very long lines,4.0,,"It was a gorgeous indoor garden. I would suggest this if you were to choose only 1 among all the displays in Gardens by the Bay. It lost 1 star in our rating simply because of the long lines (and people cutting the line)
Impressive indoor waterfall, beautiful view from the bridge. A lot of photo ops, unfortunately it was too crowded to fully relax in the ‘jungle’ atmosphere."
,,As incredibly as the photos would have you believe,5.0,,"As incredibly as the photos would have you believe. This place is breathtaking for adults and was entertaining for my 4-year old, as well. Beautiful."
,,Amazing space,5.0,,"As public glasshouses go, this is certainly up there with the best of them. The sheer overwhelming abundance of the planting is jaw dropping. The walkways can get crowded but then if you go at a peak time anywhere in singapore, then you expect that. We got re-entry stamps on the way out and came back later for a much less busy experience at night. The waterfall is impressive and the mistings every 2nd (Even) Hour add a different dimension, particularly at night (last entry 20:30). Assuming that the limestone artefacts are real, I think the upside down stalactites display is out of place and implies that the creators of this eco-experience have commissioned the physical and permanent destruction of a cave ecosystem just for the novelty. The whole experience however is definitely worth a visit and as people have mentioned, the global warming film on the way out is sobering and well done."
,,Great effort to re-create nature and preservations,4.0,,A must visit in Singapore to see how you can re-create beautiful nature and take initiatives to preserve flora for the sake of our next generations. Motivation it gives us is promising...
,,Enjoyed it,5.0,,"The waterfall, the layout, the plants, flowers, exhibits, were all amazing Can take beautiful views of Singapore If you only have time or money for one of the domes, I would recommend the Cloud Forest"
,,Absolutely worth it,5.0,,"You can spend a day here, the flowers and displays are extensive. Set over several levels all connected by lifts. Not only is it beautiful, constant air conditioned mountain top climate, complete with misters, makes it and excellent escape from a hot day"
,,Excellent Place,5.0,,Excellent Place. It has multi level forest with water falling from the top. The way it was architected is marvellous. Natural and one would thoroughly enjoy. A must visit for nature lovers
,,best way to enjoy nature,5.0,,"im not a nature lover that goes out of his way, but this placeis worth it, seeing it in comfort, up close, real, and beautiful. informative, clean, safe. see it"
,,Cannot praise the enough,5.0,,If you don't have time to see all the gardens by the Bay try and at least make time for the Cloud Forest. Words cannot do justice to all that has been achieved here. You walk in the door and the spectacle in front of you is incredible. Even if you are not a big garden lover you will be impressed with all on display here. Leave enough time to do the visit justice.
,,Dome forest,5.0,,Great place a must do in Singapore. Make sure you take a coat as it’s a mountain rainforest so can get a bit cold
,,Our favourite dome.,4.0,,This dome is amazing. From the second you walk in you are presented with the most magnificent waterfall and it just continues to amaze.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience, the wonderful waterfall the walkways that lead to the top taking you through the beautiful plants. Totally enjoyed it"
,,Awe inspiring,5.0,,Do not miss this attraction it is well laid out and something to see every where you look words cannot describe this to do it justice.
,,Best experience in Singapore,5.0,,This place was one of the most beautiful sightseen I ever had! It is absolutely amazing how they have integrated nature into a building. The pity thing about it is there are too many people visiting at the same time. So it got easily crowed. Try to go early in the morning and have your ticket bought it before.
,,Quite an experience.,4.0,,"The first thing that hit me as I walked in was how cool it was. It was 31C outside and much less in the Dome. I soon found out why, but I'll not spoil the surprise for those who have not been. We also arrived at 'misting'; on the hour, every hour and it gave the whole place a surreal feeling, like being high up in the Himalayas.
Lifts and escalators take you up and down the central massive and as you wind your way around there is a lot of plant life to look at, including some spectacular orchids. You also get to reach the top of the indoor waterfall which is very, very high.
It does become very busy, but it is a big venue and it doesn't feel crowded.
Tip-have your wrist stamped on the way out in case you want to come back later."
,,Dome forest,5.0,,"Indoor rain forest. Odd-worldly sight that must be seen. Real rainforest in the Singapore nature reserves is another thing, but this is also well worth the visit."
,,Must see it,5.0,,Wonderful it’s not the first time i went and i will go back again! It’s like a different world! The waterfall and the way you can walk in between all the flowers and trees unbelievable! The way through the cloud forest is for everyone perfect.
,,Wow !,5.0,,"A great experience, recommended if you have a couple of hours free.
Access via the MRT for the easiest way and clearest instructions to get there,
It gives a very clear educational environmental message but in a beautiful way.
Loved the feeling of being atop a rainforest !"
,,Perfect Wet Weather Activity,5.0,,"Our gardens visit was hampered by wet weather, but it was perfect to walk though the cloud forest in the rain. The children particularly loved this activity and it was genuinely beautiful. I am not into gardening and I loved it!"
,,Tropical paradise,5.0,,"The exquisite types of lowers and fauna were breath-taking. I’m not overly into flowers but if you are visiting Singapore, this is a must see. The structure is remarkably brilliant and well thought out. So many photo opportunities. Would revisit if in Singapore again."
,,Great,5.0,,"As I mentioned earlier it is a great place to be in. In fact better of two domes. Like whole of the Singapore the place is stroller friendly, specially mentioned this as the even the bridge to waterfall is stroller friendly."
,,Stunning,5.0,,A beautiful display of plants and structures with a fine mist being spread over the Forrest at regular intervals. The covering of assorted plants and flowers is well worth a visit.
,,FABULOUS,5.0,,"It is very easy to see why this attraction has been awarded a certificate of excellence. From the moment you first walk in and see the waterfall to the highly important video at the end (really, you must sit and watch this short but necessary video.. it's message is aimed at us all), you will experience a masterpiece of engineering, education and breathtaking exhibits. It would be very easy to spend hours and hours in here if you have the time, but we still enjoyed it so much with only a couple of hours available to us. Stunning looking from the outside with the marvellous dome structures, it is equally stunning on the inside. We'll done Singapore!"
,,Astonishingly Beautiful,5.0,,"If I could give this place a 6 out of 5 I would have....the Singaporeans are known for their environmental consciousness and this takes that to a whole new level. They have constructed a cloud forest inside a dome; the whole thing is truly a spectacular feat of engineering, ingenuity, and natural splendour. If you only have time to do one thing in Singapore, visit the Gardens By The Bay. When visiting the Cloud Forest dome, do not miss the opportunity to walk behind the waterfall. The whole experience is just W-O-W. No description or photo really does it justice -- you have to go see it for yourself.

Tip: There are two domes -- the Cloud Forest, and a Flower Garden. Visit the flower gardens first and then do the Cloud Forest. Trust me -- the order is important. The Flower Dome is amazing -- truly -- but the Cloud Forest just takes your breath away and it's good to end on a ""high note"". Also, at the end of the Cloud Forest there is a video -- don't skip it no matter how uncomfortable it might make you -- the message is really important (pertains to climate change)."
,,breath taking,5.0,,this place is amazing with its superlative fall and the sky walk..great learning for kids and teens..
,,Wow!,5.0,,"We liked this place so much, we saw it twice. Once in the daylight and then once more after dark. The experience is well set up and the expanse of the space really creates a sense of being transported to a cloud forest. Even with throngs of other tourists it didn't feel too busy. Lots of options to get around for individuals with mobility challenges. A real gem. Strongly recommended."
,,Beautiful garden with aircon!,5.0,,"Such a beautiful garden in the middle of Singapore. A great place to spend an hour or so with air conditioning, away from the Singapore heat and humidity!"
,,Truly amazing,5.0,,If you don't visit anything else in Singapore do spend sometime seeing the the cloud forest. You wont be disappointed but depending on when you go be prepared to queue and be one of a large number of tourists.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Wow what can I say every level is gorgeous the waterfall in beginning as you walk in is lovely, the plants on all levels well maintained and cared for a truly lovely experience"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Worth the time to visit. It is excellent work of human species to architect this cloud forest. It is simply amazing.
,,A crazy cool place.,5.0,,A cloud forest under a dome in the tropics. Absolutely worth visiting. Don't pass up the opportunity to walk behind the waterfall.
,,Possibly the top attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are looking for a WOW, be sure to come here. The humid cool environment is a refreshment from the super hot city!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,This is one of the best experiences to try. I found this very cool and relaxing. You can spend good amount of time and relax in mist.
,,Beautiful cool retreat,5.0,,fabulously beautiful. We visited of an evening. prior to our arriving there had been a long line for the cloud forest but it was immediately available for entry when we arrived. Even at night it was fantastic but I am sure it would be even more beautiful in the day.
,,Rain forest mountain,5.0,,Second visit. I love it. Bring a shower coat it really is a rain forest Lovely misty environment with good disabled access. Best in hot season when orchids blooming ... take your time and take it in
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,Truly magnificent worth the visit nowhere else I have visited like this in any country.I strongly anyone visiting Sinapore to go there mainly at night
,,Very fun but cold!,5.0,,The place is so beautiful! We spent only 1 hour there cause we didn’t have time but I would easly spend like 4 hours there. One recommendation: take a jacket. It is VERY cold inside.
,,A mixed message being broadcast here,5.0,,"I really do appreciate the message being pushed home hard and fast here by the operators of the park with respect to exploitation of natural resources and the effects humanity is having on global warming, I have to give them a ten out of ten for that. Counter this however with the implied destruction of and desecration of a number of caves around the world (mostly Sarawak I suspect) in order to decorate the attraction to imply a connection with caves. Some of the formations exhibited here will be in excess of 20,000 years old, they will have looked much better in their natural environment and for the most part they have been displayed here upside down i.e. what would have been stalagmites in their natural setting are displayed as stalagmites here. In places the park uses fiberglass imitation formations. They would be far better to extend the fiberglass imitations and put the natural ones back where they came from (although logistically this is now impossible)"
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,This was beautiful well worth the visit. Bit chilly inside so take a jacket or wrap. So many beautiful trees and plants.
,,Despite the special features this is actually quite boring.,2.0,,"Slightly smug attraction that you feel you need to visit or else you would be missing out. Unfortunately, it is another instance of the hype and the engineering overwhelming what is actually seen. Disappointing, and hardly worth the effort, let alone the queuing.
It is the equivalent of watching an action movie but without any dialogue, and little or no explanation but high ( literally) on special effects / clever automated features.
We trudged up several floors, following the crowds and apart from the inevitable mass ""selfies"", there was little to keep us there- so we went down as quick as we could.
Despite the special features this is actually quite boring."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Yet another visit. Took MRT then walked through trees. We timed entry by luck as mist be discharged. Fabby. Slow walk around looking examining taking loads photos. Very busy cruise passengers and too many iPad and selfie sticks! We would return next visit.
,,WOW WOW WOW,5.0,,A MUST VISIT! It was fabulous. Walking around inside was enchanting. It was very cool temperature and around every corner there was something new to see. The flowers and plants were so colorful. It was a very relaxing time!!!
,,Lazy way to experience cloud forest environment,4.0,,"Well designed experience/taster of what it feels like to be in a high altitude cloud forest without the effort of trekking up a mountain (although if you have the opportunity to trek into a real cloud forest it is well worth the effort)
Plenty to see if you are interested in plants that grow naturally altitude and interesting to note that many of these plants are now found in gardens and houses in more northern latitudes where the climate is cooler and similar to the temperatures found at height in the tropics.
The aerial walkway in the dome gives a good sense of a tree top forest walkway but could be scary for those who don't like heights."
,,A MUST do experience!,5.0,,"As I entered this place, I totally forgot I was in Singapore. This place is simply unreal and you are simply amazed at the fact that it exists. The water that runs down, the plants that grow on the side of this building. It simply is a breathtaking experience. I heard it is more amazing at night time, check the google photos."
,,a WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.,5.0,,EDUCATIONAL and BEAUTIFUL but a Little too warm and humid for me. An opportunity tp experience a different climate.
,,"The Cloud Forest Dome at Gardens by the Bay is absolutely stunning, inspiring and fun",5.0,,"Our favourite of the two Domes the Cloud Forest Some is a must see. The flowers were stunning; inspiring for those interested in gardens, art and just admiring beautiful nature.

The waterfall is a real 'Ahh' moment and a great way to start the exhibit and it doesnt let you down from there.

With 're-entry' stamps you can go in more than once as you spend time meandering around the Gardens.

11 out of 10 for this experience!"
,,Magical,5.0,,"Unique indoor conservatory experience - walk through gardens and forest levels with beautiful plants in and around a large waterfall. Lovely and cool also, a great activity for extremely hot or rainy days in Singapore."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,I could come here everyday. This place is just like a fairly land. Everything looks magical. Definitely worth visiting. Do make sure you get to the top to catch the fabulous view. Redeem your Singapore Airlines boarding pass to get a discount.
,,Not a must see,1.0,,We went there because everyone told us this was a must see. Why would I pay money to go see man made miniature forest where I can just go hiking in my home land? Nothing was really impressive...
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,A must see. Took so many photos as it all was stunning. Amazing what has been created here. The use of water is amazing.
,,One of a kind attraction,4.0,,This is one of the most interesting attractions I have been to. Really something worth seeing. A definite must for all families.
,,"Wonderful - both fun, educational and impressive",5.0,,"Very impressive and interesting for both kids and adults! A bit colder than we expected though so bring a sweater/blanket for the babies/toddlers. Our kids really enjoyed it and particularly the lego flowers amazed them. This is both fun, educational and impressive. Money well spent."
,,mixed feelings,3.0,,Great architecture. Biggest man made catarract. Nice flowers. Stroller friendly. Pricey for what it is.
,,Astounding and unmissable.,5.0,,"You just cannot visit Singapore without visiting this place, it really will take your breath away, just stunning and beautiful."
,,In the cloud,5.0,,"A place full of wonder and surprises. The tropical plants climb on cliff, water drips and mist descend from above, tingling our pores, cooling our heated body, freshness of the green plants assaulting our olfactory glands, One almost wants to chew some salad green. The exotic plants and landscape is a paradise on earth. A must experience when you are in Singapore, building wth more than billions of dollars. Experience the billion dollars dream land for a small price is really a great bargain."
,,is it real?,5.0,,This is a dream like experience. Make sure you are there when they pump steam. It makes the whole space look more mysterious. I think they do that every hour. Just check with them.
,,Awesome. Must visit,4.0,,We really enjoyed this. Friendly staff. Stroller friendly. Bit pricey but worth it. We saw beautiful plants and the waterfall was amazing. Kids enjoyed it. Nice and cool in the heat.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The cloud forest is really cool. Gorgeous plants. Loved the cloud walk and water fall. Did not get to see the mist show but still was great. Highly recommend.
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"This place is marvellous! I was there was it was extremely humid and walking into that place was bliss. Aside from the cool atmosphere, there are plants and flowers in this forest that you will never find anywhere in the wild. They have crammed every ecosystem into this building, allowing you to witness the beauty of mountain top vegetation to desert landscapes."
,,besides the great architecture not much to see,1.0,,The architecture of the build is beautiful but it's expensive to get inside and it isn't a true full cloud forest--it's a big waterfall with some lame plants. Don't believe the hype.
,,"Visit, it's a must see.",5.0,,Loved it here such beauty with so much to see. The flowers and plants are very well looked after creating a myriad of wonderful colours.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is spectacular. There is something wonderful around every corner. A special testament to Singapore in conservation. Allow a couple of hours just in the Cloud Forest. It was Xmas when we were there and the decorations were stunning.
,,Green wonder!,5.0,,"This is lovely!!! The big trees with a lot of interesting plants, exclusive flowers and nice trees. It is worth visiting it if you travel to Singapore! :-)"
,,Busy but calm oasis in the city,5.0,,A brilliant and amazing construction providing a multi climate rain forest in a controlled environment. Loved the waterfalls and fantastic wooden carved statues throughout. Well worth the cost.
,,Pretty cool!,5.0,,A nice place to escape the heat of the day. I'm not much into plants. But I found this place very interesting. A great way to spend a couple hours.
,,Relax from the heat for a while,4.0,,"From the outside you'd never notice that there was a giant waterfall inside the glass domes that you see from anywhere at Gardens by the Bay. The place is worth a visit as is beautiful inside but you can do each of the glass domes in about 20-30 minutes so it's quite short. There's isn't a huge amount to do once inside apart from walk round and admire all the different plants, water features and flowers."
,,Excellent forest simulation in a glass dome,5.0,,This place is excellent with a artificially built rain forest with water falls and lots of trees and board walk. It’s must visit.
,,Excellent !,5.0,,Nature and man's creativity is what results in the cloud dome at the Gardens by the bay ..absolutely stunning visually and calming for the senses ..what a wonderful creation .must visit
,,Worth a visit - a cloud rainforest within the city,4.0,,"The cloud forest is worth a visit, although it is mainly interesting for plant lovers and those who would like to escape the humid heat in Singapore. For those who expect a tropical rainforest like on Borneo, it might be boring. It is a miniature cloud forest which provides great views over the bay and the city as well as all sorts of carnivorous plants and moss, little ponds...

Be prepared and take a cardigan, sweater or jacket with you since it is rather chilly, especially compared to the temperature outdoors."
,,"Nothing that great to see, but a nice experience.",3.0,,"It was freezing cold upon entry and a little boring other than for the waterfall. The walks were nice and fun, but the kids were bored."
,,Nice walking,5.0,,If you go here take metro cheap easy service Go at night but before 8pm if you want to walk on high walk way it close at 8:30 last ticket 8 Pm well worth the time
,,Delightful!!,5.0,,"This was a delightful experience. We visited at noon which was one of the misting times. The water vapor in the air really made you feel like you were in the mountains. Great ambience. When you enter the Cloud Forest, the huge waterfall is awesome. It really sets the tone for your experience. Take your time as you walk through and note the care given to detail such as the sculptures and wood carvings set among the plants. The Secret Garden at the very end is very nice. We watched the film on climate change and its effects on our planet. Very good. I might add that it is very cool and comfortable inside. I highly recommend the Cloud Forest."
,,Magnificent plce,5.0,,We visited this venue without any expectations and this was magnificent. We highly recommend spending a lot of time taking in the beauty colours and vibrancy of this attraction. It has been the highlight of our holiday so far.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,A must see attraction. The waterfall is amazing and the wall of plants just stunning! I am not great with heights and the walkway was a little scary for me but it was well worth it for the views!
,,Unbelievably Beautiful,5.0,,"This was the most breathtaking of all at Gardens by the bay. Visit this after the Flower dome. It is unbelievable. You will feel like you stepped into the Amazon! You are welcomed by this 5 storey man-made waterfall. It is all misty and chilly inside. Do remember to carry a jacket while there. Take a few pictures there and head inside. There is an elevator, take that to the top floor and there is this glass floor pathway that goes right next to the ceiling of the dome. It is breathtaking. The view from there is magical. You can see the Marina Bay Sands in the background, and at the right time and right place, you will be able to click a beautiful picture.
There are misting sessions that happen every 2 hours and the last one is at 8pm. Do not miss it. If you are one for relaxing and enjoying, the cloud forest is the place for you. With a slightly chilly atmosphere and the sound of falling water, this place can keep you happy for hours together.
Also, one you enter and exit these domes, you cannot come back inside, so take in all that you can at one go."
,,Loved it,5.0,,If ever in Singapore it is a must do to visit the Cloud Forest. Walking through the cloud walk was amazing. Our children aged 12 and 10 loved it.
,,The Best of the two Domes,4.0,,This is in my opinion the best of the two domes. Beware that you might have to wait in line to go up the elevators.
,,on top of the world,5.0,,"rare experience in the forest. full of water vapours, and very significant for the movie it shows for conservation of species."
,,Another must see,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a big must see. Amazing!
You really do feel like you're walking up in the mountains surrounded by clouds.
Really enjoyed the carnivorous plants display at the top and the huge waterfall and plants with ferns and all sorts all the way up and down.
Thoroughly enjoyed walking around Cloud Forest."
,,yes everyone must see,5.0,,"the feel, as you enter the place with mist all around you and the gigantic fall transforms you to some fairyland. its a perfect spot not only for kids but also couples. if in singapore i highly recommend"
,,Keep your DSLR people!,5.0,,"Tips for photographers: keep your DSLR inside your bags at the entrance because you’d be welcomed with waterfall. Make sure to read the schedule of water mist, the sprinklers will spray the mist everywhere. I think it is better to use your phone to photograph the views than using any camera, its easier to keep and hassle free."
,,"A few extra dollars, but worth every cent.",5.0,,A magnificent sight as nature and infrastructure come together. With the beautiful waterfalls and misty treetop walking pathways take you to different world. A must visit sight. Its something to witness and way better than reading it on here or watching a video on YouTube.
,,Not a must visit place,1.0,,"Nothing except the water fall and the midst release. Can finish in an hour, everyone do the same thing, enter-que to level - walk down from level 7 through the bridges. The outdoor supertree garden is better."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,We went when weather was poor and just before new year so lines were not too bad. Loved the experience!! Highly recommend
,,"In awe of the place, service and plants",4.0,,"Even though it was raining, it did not bother us at all with the inconvenience. We were mesmerized by the experience and I have to say it is a MUST VISIT in Singapore."
,,"Stunning, man-made gardens",5.0,,"Family of four travelling, including two young children (aged 4 and 18 months). It was a bit chilly inside so make sure you bring something warm for the little ones (e.g. a long sleeve top). We easily went around the dome with a pram using the ramps or elevators.

Suggest if you have young kids to bring bathers so that they can play at the Children's Playground afterwards, which is a short walk from the Cloud Forest."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The Cloud forest is a must see in Singapore! Everything flourishes in this little slice of heaven- waterfalls, secret gardens, orchids by the zillion and at night the mist looks like clouds. Plus I got engaged here in a bed of moss and ferns on 18th December 2017 ^_^"
,,Must see,5.0,,"The building, Organisation and content are wonderful. Waterfall is not special. Approximately 1 hour is needed to visit."
,,Cool and beautiful,5.0,,"The cloud forest zone is a great place to see all sorts of plants in a natural environment. The cloud walk is highly recommended, care as the walkways will be wet.

Best time to go would be during the week as the weekends are full of families."
,,Worth the hype.,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is right next to the Flower Dome. This is a man made high rise structure, approximately seven stories tall. There is an elevator that takes you to the top.
There are walkways jutting out demo the plant covered forest. For those who don’t like heights, this can be a little daunting. The entire dome is larger than it looks and there is a lot to see. Once down there is still more to see with a short film, interactive displays on climate change and more plant life and sculptures to see. I can see why this is a must see attraction in Singapore."
,,Don't miss it - you have to buy a separate ticket - will take you 1-2 hours,5.0,,"A wonderful experience. A it is quite cool inside, especially if you are visiting in summers. There is a cascading waterfall. There is a lift to take you to the top (about 10-20 minutes in Q) and one then walks down, observing flowers. There are plenty of informative signs posted and it takes time to read and move along. And there is a huge waterfall - nice photo op."
,,Manufactured Natural Beauty! Ha!,5.0,,"From the moment you enter it is quite stunning. Our kids instantly complained about how cold it was. Keep it mind, in general it was a cold day in Singas - or as cold as I imagine it gets.
The line to get to the top was rather short. We were in before midday. As we were finishing up the lines were rather long - near on 1. It would have taken some time to get to the top.
I do have to say that you get ushered along the walk way which kind of takes away from the moment of just the simple joy of looking at plants.
The weird bit for us was the stalactites, stalagmites and crystals. I just loved all the lines, bends and curves. The 4 and 9 yr old didn't complain but at the end said it was ok."
,,What a marvel,5.0,,So many plants in a controlled enviroment and sustainable as well makes this an appealing attraction
,,One of highlights in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"One of the paid attractions in Gardens by the Bay - Visit this as package. Features a man-made waterfall. Currently attractions in the Gardens have Christmas themes. Book your tickets via Klook.com, using ""295D1"" code for SGD $4.4 discount!"
,,Absolute must visit!,5.0,,One of the most spectacular sights I have ever seen and experienced! A must go to invigorate your senses!
,,Brilliant Exibit,4.0,,"Wonderfully laid out exhibit, easy walk throughout, elevators and lifts provided. A lovely display of flowers, shrubs, climbers and epiphytes. Although there was an audio explanation if you wanted we didn't choose that, so although there was some labelling it would have been helpful to have had more for some of the plants and flowers"
,,Extremely Impressive. #1 Singapore attraction,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest @ Gardens by the bay is an absolute must do in Singapore.

The sheer scale and technical accomplishment is quite overwhelming.

- As is the beauty of this man made ecosystem - based on a naturally occurring cloud forest.

There are also contemporary artworks by prominent artists subtly intermingled within the planters.

Take a jacket - it's humid and cool inside.

I would recommend at least 2 hours for this dome and another hour for the botanic garden which is next door.

Price for both tickets is approximately 40$ Singapore. Totally worth it. If you are a frequent visitor, the annual pass for unlimited access is only about double they amount.

Don't miss this!

Provided you have good weather, take a few hours to walk around Gardens at the bay too. Again, very impressive - look out for the man made tree canopy. The garden area is free.

Basically, spend a day here!"
,,Very good to spend part of your day,4.0,,"Living in Singapore, we habe the annual membership and we like so much to visit this one to relax and recognize how beautiful the trees, the flowers and this place is!

I am delighted always to go from the top to the bottom of the cloud!

It is nice for you to see all in half day and going back home for
Lunch!"
,,We love it!!,5.0,,A place to chill and admiring the forest with so much surprises. The trail walk especially the Lost World. We love it!
,,unimaginable!!!!,4.0,,The greenery..overwhelms you and transports you to a land of calm salubrios vegetation unimaginable in the modern city.... a must visit...... give sentosa a miss if short of time ...but not this!!!!
,,A must-see for any visitor to Singapore,5.0,,In the domes in Gardens by the Bay. Amazing. Walk high around the treetops in the magical gardens. Start with an open air trolley trip around the entire gardens. English tour commentary. Very good.
,,You'l be glad to came,5.0,,"This is one of two ""Domes"" that make up the Garden by the Bay experience. This is not only worth visiting, but you should pay the extra fee for the guided tour, otherwise there will oodles of facts and details that you will miss."
,,My favorite spot in Singapore,5.0,,Go late in the day just as the steam or clouds start entering. Be sure to get there while still light though.
,,Not so good,2.0,,"What you see in the photo, you will see if you get inside. You do not have to pay for it. Excessive humidity at a point you can not breathe."
,,Hanging Gardens of Cyberlon.,5.0,,"Babylon had the Hanging Gardens (or not). Singapore has the Cloud Forest, a kind of cybernetic, futuristic Asian equivalent of the Hanging Gardens. It's remarkable achievement of botany, engineering, education and aesthetics. This is honestly one of the most impressive places I've ever visited in my life, and I've been twice. Going at night offers a rather unique feeling, and I would strongly recommend you go there around two hours before closing, and enjoy the misting as the windows look out onto a dark sky."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful an absolute must you may also want to pack a light jumper especially if visiting at night as it is freezing inside and you are also getting a little wet from the waterfall but it is such a magical place make sure you take plenty of photos
,,Long que. but worth the visit,5.0,,This is awesome architecture and a great education on our plant life. The flowers are amazing. Well worth a visit
,,Felt like i am in western ghat,5.0,,"Great place to visit in Singapore, its awesome. The 35 meters indoor waterfall, Cloud Walk,Treetop Walk and touch the cloud. Cloud forest is one of the best place for nature lovers where we can see different types of plants and flowers."
,,Out of the world - Must if you visit SIngapore,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, very unique, entry ticket required. Washroom facilities available. Various floors to see, lift also available for old people."
,,Unique Nature and Beauty,5.0,,"Yes it is not a real forest but they make it real. keep it clean also and you should wear a sweater if you dont like cold ambient,"
,,Beautiful and inspiring,5.0,,A great 1-2 hour trip for all the family. Loads of photos going on but didn't detract from the green calm. Great political message on bottom floor as a reminder of human destruction and inspiring action.
,,Chill at Cloud Forest,5.0,,Wonderful greeting at the door by a Giant Waterfall cascade. It bring cheer to visitors. And there is always a rush to get photos taken by friends wit the Cascade as a backdrop
,,Singapore Cloud Forest,5.0,,This should be on everyone's Bucket List! This is a staggering concept and mind blowing structure which not many countries could achieve. A mountain in a cloud in a dome! You have to experience it to understand how magnificent it is.
,,Part of GbtB - must see,5.0,,Truly amazing construction in the middle of Singapore City a short walk fro the CBD. A must see and very inexpensive
,,Very cool experience!,4.0,,"If you have to choose, this is the dome you should visit. While the Flower Dome is rather ordinary this one is definitetly not! Very cool and different experience from start to finish but not something for those that are afraid of heights (you can of course choose to not take the elevator up but you will then miss the best parts)."
,,Simply wow,5.0,,The concept and detail is beyond expectation the work that the gardeners do is meticulous. From the waterfall upon entry to walking the gangway on the seventh floor it is a total joy and a place I would recommend to anyone who is contemplating visiting Singapore
,,A place to appreciate flowers and greeneries,5.0,,Cloud Forest is located in Gardens By The Bay and it is one of the cooled conservatories. It requires admission tickets to enter. You will see the world’s tallest indoor waterfall in the Cloud Forest and appreciate rare plants in it.
,,very recommended!,5.0,,i like this place a lot. once we get inside we feel the cold as in the mountains with a very high waterfall. also a high bridge. very contrary to the weather in the very hot singapore
,,Not worth even free,3.0,,"It is not worth to visit. It is too artificial. Plants are tropical but do not match w steel structures of the building. It could be suitable for school education, not for touristic purpose. Entry price is too high"
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"This is one among the two domes in Gardens by the Bay. Upon entry, there us a very high waterfall which will splash drops on you. That makes the atmosphere very cool.

Later there are different types and sizes of flowers located on each level. The landscaping is amazing.

In the middle there is a lift to climb to the top, from where you start your downward journer through the different sections."
,,This is one of the most amazing places,5.0,,"The engineering of this garden is unbelievable, we went Christmas Day so it was crowded but the flow of people through the garden meant the only wait was to go up the elevator to the top. The plants and sculptures are truely beautiful, if you only want to do one of the domes in the gardens then this is the one to chose"
,,An amazing place in Singapore,4.0,,"This is the second time I go to that place and it's still an amazing one.
You will be able to have a walk across several layers discovering a lot of surprises. Alone or with friends or family you can enjoy a lovely moment there. Around the place you can also have a walk in the gardens around."
,,Horrible waste of time,1.0,,"I was quite excited to see the Gardens by the Bay. And while the Flower Dome was ok, the Supertree Grove and Cloud Forest were terribly disappointing.

Firstly, the Cloud Forest seems to be misleadingly sold as the Supertree access. As there are signs for Supertree Grove everywhere but there are no actual tickets for this, it is possible to mistake the Cloud Forest for the main attraction. Especially when the park’s ticketing agent tells you so when asked directly.

Secondly, this is essentially a giant, hour plus long queue walking around a man made water fountain. While the structure has some plants and flowers on the outside you never get close enough to see them properly. And the inside of the fountain is just concrete so you feel like you are winding your way down a multi-story car park that is suffering from a burst water pipe.

As with many experiences, who you are in the queue with makes a difference. While the Flower Dome was also busy, because it was more open plan, everyone can move as needed. But the combination of a lack of interesting things to see and the prescriptive queueing means that lots of aggressive pushing ensues theoughout including on ramps, stairs, and just waiting to catch a lift. I am aware that pushing aggressively is culturally accepted in some countries. But when everyone is walking at the same speed and you suddenly get elbowed out by grannies who want to take a photo where you happen to be standing, it is a surprise. After about five incidents by different people from different parties, it starts getting boring.

Would not go back if I was paid,"
,,Cloud experience in a sunny day,4.0,,We visited this place and it is next to the garden by the bay in the same area.... the experience is amazing and make you feel like you are on the cloud
,,Great but Terrible Lines,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was quite amazing, and I really enjoyed it, but the line to the top was absolutely terrible. It was not organized particularly well, and I waited about 45 minutes before finally making it to the top. I only got to the top earlier because they decided to open up an additional emergency elevator."
,,Indoor waterfall,4.0,,"What I see about the cloud forest, is mostly the indoor waterfall or it’s really nothing else, maybe you will like it. You can go there and try it out!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Excellent destination and must visit place in Singapore.Incredible variety of plants reprent the varied climate and place on the planet.
,,Admission could be better organized,3.0,,"Visited the attraction last Friday.
It was so crowded that the Q for the elevator stretched to over 50 meters. There was no sign for the joining the Q . As a first time visitor it was chaotic. Near the front of the Q we were told that the Q time was 30 minutes. As we had a visitor on wheel chair it was not practical for us to wait. But we had difficulty in taking the exit ( down the stairs ! ) with a wheel chair. Eventually a staff member helped us using the staff lift. A case of poor planning.
We could have avoided the frustration if we had been alerted on the long Q and waiting time. Time and money wasted !!!"
,,Do go,5.0,,Awesome arrangement ..spectacle....flora from around the world ...walk over the bridge and absorb nature closeness
,,Great place,5.0,,"Man made water falls with amazing flowers and plants landscapes, kids enjoyed it so much, air conditioned"
,,Evening visit to the Cloud Forest dome,4.0,,"I spent an evening in the Gardens by the Bay and visited the Cloud Forest dome, among other attractions. It is quite great to see and walk around.
My recommendation: When going to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, go to the Flower Dome first since the Cloud Forest is more impressive."
,,Interesting and nice,4.0,,"You have To see this as a reminder for thinking green. There is a nice walk in a small vegetal hill, where your attention is drawn around the consequences of climate change.
Your total visit may not exceed 1 hour, during which you will enjoy the refreshing atmosphere."
,,An artificial waterfall with beautiful plants,5.0,,"The waterfall is, of course, man made. Nonetheless, it is impressive as you walk on a ramp in front and behind it. You walk in an atmosphere cooled so that the temperature at the top of the falls is decidedly cooler than that at the bottom. The boards tell you that the top of the waterfall is designed to emulate the environment in a tropical rain forest (e.g. Borneo, Costa Rica) at 1000 meters to 2000 meters. The top of the falls has plants that would thrive at 2000 meters; the bottom has those that should thrive at 1000 meters"
,,OMG the Orchids!,5.0,,We were a little unsure about going into the Cloud Forest but it was the BEST decision. These garden are beautifully designed and displayed and the orchids are truely amazing. Well worth the $30 for my daughter and I to wander through for about one hour. And it’s a great respite from the Singapore heat.
,,"Amazing, amazing and amazing",5.0,,"How beautiful is this place! From the moment that you reach the top, it isn’t incredible to see the different views, the waterfall and many more varieties of trees and plants. I liked st the end the shop as well where you find so many things to take with you.

I liked how they do the flow of the areas and how describe the flowers and plants."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"The better of the two exhibits in the Gardens by the Bay precinct but visit them both! They are both outstanding. Try and time your visit to the Cloud Forest to coincide with the 'misting', a complete rainforest experience!"
,,Beautiful Forest😘,5.0,,"100% percent we enjoyed exploring inside the Cloud Forest. Beautiful & relaxing inside as if you are really in the Forest. Love the beautiful falls, the plants & the flowers inside. Love walking on the bridge inside giving us more good views of the man made Nature done perfectly to enjoy. Very good to experience by everyone & to appreciate & love Nature. . My family & our relatives enjoyed the details inside. We love it!"
,,A rain forest so true to form that U will think that U are in the rain forest.,4.0,,Went there with a few friends by MRT and decided to take a view of the cloud forest. Very pleasant surprised of the details n varied plant life with a waterfall n multitude of flowers. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Man-made forest it is!,5.0,,"We do all know that Singapore was not blessed with natural landscape that offers breathtaking views. However, the government was still able to compensate this by building man-made tourist destinations. And Cloud Forest is definitely one of my favorites. They built the dome with intricate details. It's as if you're inside a filming location. Definitely a must if you're in Singapore."
,,Must see,5.0,,Cloud forest was not only a refreshing break from walking around in the heat but a time to appreciate how they have put this place together. Beautiful plants from all over the world and uniquely done with great views. I would choose to do cloud forest over the other one but if you do both make sure you leave cloud forest until last!
,,Airconditioned Dome,4.0,,Nice and cooling place to visit. Whole dome is air-conditioned and you get a bit cold if you stay inside for some time. Good environment to know all the plants/flowers on show. There's always different special themes at different time of the year.
,,One time experience !!!,4.0,,The entire experience is nice but its better to visit during sunsets. Go up the forest before sunset and come down post sunsets.
,,breathtaking,5.0,,"Wow ! what an amazing experience, so lush, so beautifully laid out. We held our breath at the very top, it's high ! But a wonderful view of the waterfall and the plants cascading down the tower. A must see for any visit to SIngapore."
,,Superb,5.0,,"If you're into plants, this extraordinary dome will keep you enthralled for hours. It's riotous. I've never seen so many varieties thriving together. The engineering behind the scenes is probably equally amazing. Staff are unobtrusive but very helpful, audio tours are available and a very strong sustainability, conservation and preservation message is skillfully offered."
,,The feel of this place is amazing,5.0,,"Cloud forest , This place I must say has an amazing vibe the worlds tallest indoor waterfall doesn’t make you feel if it isn’t real , with the greenery and landscape around it , it makes you feel you’re in the middle of a forest with beautiful flowers and plants growing in and around it , had a wonderful time here. This place is a must visit when you’re in Singapore ."
,,Amazing spectacle,5.0,,Mind-blowing experience for even the 'botanically naive'..........a must visit when in Singapore - the variety of plants and the way in which they are presented is a delight. Do not rush the experience - everywhere one looks there is something worth looking at / photographing.
,,Simply delited,5.0,,Cloud forest setup is awesome.. Not a big one like flower dome. Enjoy the artificial waterfalls which is really awesome.. Got to walk a bit inside.. Should visit.
,,An average experience,3.0,,"Everything being artificial, didn't really enjoy much. Not really bad though. Different levels had different attractions. An artificial waterfall seemed to be the most-liked attraction. Good for a walk across the different levels. Overall a dull experience for me."
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,Spectacular when they put on the mist machine! Excellent accessibility for people with a mobility problem. If you have no head for heights - just take your time. Its really worthwhile to do the walk on the suspension bridges.
,,Amazing Cloud Forest,5.0,,"The cloud dome is fantastic. I like the most the indoor falls. Please don’t fail to drop by here, otherwise you’ll miss the indoor beauty of cloud forest."
,,Love it,5.0,,"Such amazing place with the waterfall inside, it can fell like real waterfall. Price is ok and worth for it !!! I can enjoy so much when i get there with my friends."
,,Beautiful waterfall,4.0,,"Beautiful garden and waterfall. Nice views form the walkway, but be prepared for lots of walking to get around."
,,Last minute visit,5.0,,"The Cloud dome was absolutely superb, if you don't do anything else put this on your list. The whole feel of the place was great, staff all great too."
,,Awesome,5.0,,This is my third time there and again I highly recommend this place. It’s a must visit place if anyone visits Singapore
,,Tallest indoor waterfall in the world!,4.0,,"We went to see the waterfall as I'm sure most people had. It was a little bit crowded around the waterfall with people taking photos but it was nice nonetheless. Walking around was very cooling and unusual, at times it was difficult to see as it was like walking through clouds. There were walks on different levels to see the different plants."
,,Simply amazing,4.0,,"The cloud forest is an indoor rain forest , only in Singapore. No where you can find in Asia and compare to this.

The cloud forest is well designed. You can spend about an hour to two in it . Sight seeing on the skywalk. Enjoy yourself .

Must go."
,,Beautiful indoor forrest ever !!!,5.0,,The air was cooled and the platation was beautiful. The waterfall was great for photo. The cool air makes us feel like entering a real rain forrest. It was beautiful indeed. And great architecture too.
,,Cooling in the humid environment.,5.0,,Fabulous attraction. A welcome cool down from the humidity. The waterfall and plants were gorgeous...definitely worth visiting whilst in Singapore.
,,"Feel like being in Movie ""Avatar""",5.0,,"Awesome is the only word to describe it. The great waterfall, walking on the trees & the futuristic looks make it really some thing that should never be missed."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A must see in Singapore. Beautiful experience, a trip within a trip. In my opinion much better than the Flowers Garden."
,,Great experience...,5.0,,"Great experience and also cooler and less humid than outside! It is brilliant how they have build this indoor forests with plants, birds, and waterfalls. A must do in Singapore."
,,Good!,4.0,,The cloud forest was good. Something different and interesting. Well made but not something mind blowing so do not expect too much.
,,Family trip to Spore,5.0,,Beautiful place! We love the canopy walk with nice view... One of the most spectacular flower to see is the tiny orchid.... beautiful!
,,Recommended.,5.0,,Beautiful experience in cloud forest. Well maintained. The artificial waterfalls from the summit of the dome is a treat to all senses. You can easily spend 1-2 hours here.
,,If you can’t get to a real rain Forrest I suppose it will do.,3.0,,"An indoor rainforest only in Singapore or I guess Disney.
It’s clean safe and very well presented thee are no mosquitoes, no snakes and nothing to do you harm so no it’s not a real rainforest so if you want the experience at a price and don’t want to get your feet dirty knock yourself out.
Seriously I know not everyone can or wants to go to a real rain Forrest so this gives you a feel for it without the inconvenience or dangers of the real thing."
,,This is a must see,5.0,,"This is the most amazing thing they have added since I was last here. It's air-conditioned, and huge, and beautiful. I'm not going to give anymore details and spoil it - just go"
,,Amazing,4.0,,This structure is like stepping into another world. Very well constructed and organised. Beautiful rainforest and waterfall displays with a skywalk that takes you right up into the top of the dome for a birds eye view. Must see.
,,very interesting,5.0,,"Was well done, a great place to visit, go early to avoid the school groups. There is also a good café for reasonable tucker."
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"My 6 yo enjoyed this place so much. It's very refreshing being around so much greenery. Of course being greeted by a water fall is amazing. The ""walk"" was craftily curated."
,,Amazing Dome at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"A really must see when you visit Singapore, the Cloud Forest brings you into another world. My wife and I made pictures till our batteries were empty."
,,First time in dome,4.0,,"Cloud dome is located in gardens by the bay, this dome is cold and has small waterfall. There was a long queue to walk on the bridge and there was a small cinema that plays about global warming, an education for all."
,,"Amazing, must visit",5.0,,"This was probably the best attraction within the Gardens at the Bay complex, although the Supertree Grove was a close second. Located just across from the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel (with its rooftop swimming pool spanning the three hotel towers), indeed the best way to reach Gardens is via this Hotel (there is a elevated walkway from the Hotel Foyer to the park).

The Cloud Forest is a temperature controlled glass dome which includes an indoor waterfall which must be over 100 ft high, canopy walkways and a staggering display of jungle plants and flowers. Design wise the whole building is truly staggering.

There is a nominal entrance fee, but well worth a visit. Indeed a must see if in the vicinity of Marina Bay.

Try to time your visit to include the futuristic Supertree Grove at night (the lights come on at 7:45pm)."
,,Amazing waterfall!,5.0,,This dome is really good with the world's tallest indoor waterfall that you can walk up and around. Well worth a visit and lots of nice flowers too.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"What a place to visit - not sure what to expect but WOW.

Bought entry ticket for both conservatories and found this the better of the 2. From the moment you enter & see the waterfall, and note the coolness of the forest, the views are great - plants, art, flowers.

The orchards on display are magnificent - colourful, size, flower. The plants growing on the side of the mountain are impressive - we found the abseiling gardeners picking out the 'sick plants' replacing them with new pots.

The mountian features an elevated path to walk down from the top, or lifts are available.

The various artpieces on display are brilliant - in their appearance but also how they are placed throughout the exhibits.

I reckon a must do, even if you aren't into plants & flowers."
,,Impressive waterfall and interesting walkway,5.0,,I loved the stunning entrance of the waterfall. Then going on to discover the art work and wood crafted structures. Well worth the visit.
,,Spectacular - don’t miss!,5.0,,"I wrote a review on the Gardens at the Bay and then found this place has its own reviews. This is a spectacular dome, really cleverly done. Interesting to watch a couple of gardeners hanging by safety harnesses doing some weeding and planting up, only one problem - took too many photos! A ‘don’t miss’ experience if you like gardens."
,,Bring your Jacket!,5.0,,"Such a beautiful landscape! There is 1 spot that you can photo: flower made from Lego! Use lift to take you to the 6th floor then stairs to 7th floor, then walked slowly down.

Tips:
- its rather cold, for those who are sensitive to coolness, bring your jacket.
- good spot to take photos
- beware of fear to heights"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,The waterfall was refreshing and beautiful.The crystal caves made me loss for words.The cloud walk had amazing scenery.TQ
,,Just stunning,5.0,,"Included as part of a trip to Gardens by the Bay. The Cloud Forest is absolutely stunning. Vast amount of trees, shrubbery and tropical plants. It has this huge waterfall which is mesmerising. Highly recommend a visit to this and the Flower Dome. You won’t be disappointed."
,,"very well planned, enjoyable experience",5.0,,"like everything in SGP, this is very thought out & planned
- interesting concept, with the two domes
- only visited the waterfall and cloud forest one...is one of the biggest indoor waterfalls, quite a refreshing sight!
- easy access and walkdown ramps
- suggest going in the late evening when its cooler and lights are coming on (very hot and humid during the day)"
,,a time to remember,5.0,,"this place is wonderful, it takes you out in the wild, a relaxing place away from home,enjoy the beauty of nature and fauan for once"
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,This is definately a must visit place. The waterfall is such a great view. The forest is so refreshing and its very cool. They do provide shuttle service from the entrance to the dome which cost SGD 6.00. The nearest MRT is Bayfront station and from there you can get to Gardens by the Bay using the underpass. There is alot of signage given or else you can just ask the friendly transport staff
,,wheelchair accessible cloud forest,5.0,,Hope you're not afraid of heights as the Cloud Forest has lift access for wheelchair users that enables you to feel like you are high up in the trees. There is a see through platform and walkway that is thrilling.
,,Seems to be the best part of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,Visited Gardens by the Bay and chose to go through the Cloud Forest. Fairly pricing for visitors to Singapore but very well done. Was the highlight of Gardens by the Bay for us.
,,Amazingly cool,5.0,,"You will be greeted with a beautiful waterfall. View was great, staff are everywhere and they even help you took a photo. What i like the most is that its a one way route so you will not be bumping to others. You can take your time in taking photos as long as you like. Wear a non slip footwear as the paths are wet. Admission
ticket is reasonable, the flowers are beautiful. Advisable to all ages and even those on wheelchair can go visit."
,,Amazing,4.0,,This is a artificial forest with amazing tree and birds inside.We walk under the trees we feel that this is a huge forest inside the city.We took a lot of pictures with this places.This place is making Singapore very unique.
,,amazing feat of engineering,5.0,,just getting the plants up there and with continuous water is an amazing achievement but it doesn't come close to seeing the real thing in the wild. Interesting activity but a bit Disney.
,,AMAZING!!!!!,5.0,,Best experience ever a must do. They got this place right thats for sure and everything is amazing especially for kids. Never seen my baby so mesmerized by it all
,,interesting and cool,4.0,,"nested next to gardens by the bay flower dome, the.cloud forest is my favorite to go to when i am hot. the forest has a misting time every two hours. it feels like a real forest when you go in during the misting time. the top is a mini garden with a pond. i reccomen you walk down the bridge to see the views of the cloud forest and marina bay"
,,amazing!!!,5.0,,"This is spectacular make sure you visit, we also did the flowers but i dont think they were as interesting but that might of just been us. We had dinner at the Chinese restaurant there and it was delicious!!"
,,Very good,5.0,,What a really nice place to visit. Liked all the different levels that you could walk to. Didn't seem crowded in there.
,,An Alien Inspired Catwalk,4.0,,"As soon as you enter, a tall indoor waterfall welcomes you. There are plenty of plants to see here including a catwalk that is inspired by the Alien movie complete with mist and fog effects. You take an elevator all the way to the top and walk your way down. There are lots to see and enjoy here about the importance of our ecosystem."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,Cloud forest is an attraction in Singapore you can visit to beat the heat. The cloud forest is a must see when visiting gardens by the bay. It’s a peaceful place to have a relaxing stroll.
,,Man-made water fall,5.0,,Water fall with mist & sort of cloud. Beautiful view from its top floor. A must watch....would definitely recommend
,,A cool walk and beautiful flora,5.0,,"A great place for a cool and peaceful walk with a view of various plant life, carvings, and don't forget to look outside at the gorgeous view of the city!"
,,Amazing wonderful,5.0,,This was our highlight of Singapore. Amazing garden with a huge range of plants. I was transported to a magical fairyland.
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,"Indoor waterfall., aircon ! Very interesting view and walk. But will be bit boring when compared to flower dome ! Magnificent execution and imagination makes me to visit here !"
,,The cooling of the clouds,5.0,,"It looks man make. But it does makes you feel like you are at the TOP of a mountain and looking at the plants and trees which is meant for cold season. Flowers are fully blooms. A man make water fall will welcome once you enter.
There is two dome to walk about.
Right now, there is Christmas market and decor going on."
,,Dont miss this,5.0,,"The cloud forest is located in the gardens by the bay and is really worht visting - the palnts there are beautiful. If youtime it right then you get to experiece the coluds, which I think are initiated twice a day."
,,Every impressive,5.0,,"Well worth a visit it is beautifully impressive. There is so much to see from plants to sculptures, the carved benches are a sight worth seeing."
,,Very cool architecture.,5.0,,"Located at Gardens by the Bays, the Cloud Forest is the moist weather counterpart to the flower dome, and far more cool. The trail walks around, up and into the artificial mountain inside the greenhouse dome. The elevated glass walkways takes you up for a magnificent view- a warning for those with a fear of heights. Indoor is quite comfortably cool and moist. A must visit in Singapore.

Note that tickets for both cloud forest and flower dome can be purchased from online agents with discount at 22USD."
,,loved it,5.0,,very informative place with a ton of flowers and plants! Ohh and the architecture mixed with all those organic shapes is just surprising. Perfect for a hot and humid afternoon. Nice and cool inside!
,,Talk about WOW factor...,5.0,,"If you’re visiting Singapore, Cloud forest is a must. Being a landscaper and horticulturist, this place for me was my favourite place I visited in my short 3 day stay. Anyone who likes plants and nature, or even if you just want to see something extraordinary, go see it. Well worth it and it’s very cold inside (a nice change from Singapore’s heat"
,,This is cool...literally,4.0,,"Inside cloud forest is like being transported to a different place. The weather here is controlled and imitates the feel of rainforest. As you make your way up, you will see the different kinds of flowers. This is great for kids as well to keep them well informed and educate them on the different flower species."
,,Boring place to kill time,3.0,,I have accompanied my oversea friends to Gloud forest. It was quite boring and nothing much to see. The only fun part is to walk on the transparent glass path when you reached the top of the building.
,,This was the pick for the day...,5.0,,We loved this place as it had so much to see and experience. As you walk around you can see some great views outside. Don't miss it! YMMV
,,a bit of a must see in Singapore,5.0,,There are two domes in the garden and visiting the two is a nice way to spend an afternoon. Not only is it interesting but the temperature is kept about 25c and after a few hours walking in Singapore it seems delightfully cool.
,,A highlight,5.0,,"Definitely visit this place. Interesting building, beautiful gardens a photography highlight if you love flowers and the view"
,,MUST VIST,4.0,,"give time to visit it is worth and very nice , it is unique, specially at night its beauty can be seen"
,,Visit to Cloud Forest,3.0,,"A man-made fountain, a cloud walk, crystal mountain and a theatre. Not much to see. You have to take the lift to Level 6 and walk up a level for the cloud walk. A view to the Flower Dome."
,,A must,5.0,,"Don't skip this! It will captivate you. I have never experienced anything so unique. Lot's to talk in, and walking paths up in the dome. Very cool experience."
,,Modern architecture softened by plants,4.0,,"A fascinating place. I really enjoyed the walkway high up in the dome. My camera didn't appreciate coming from a humid & hot outside to a wet inside, it misted up."
,,Nice indoor waterfall,5.0,,"In Singapore it can be very hot outside, but once you're inside the cloud forest a breeze will hit you! Was truly refreshing. The waterfall looks amazing and it is the biggest indoor waterfall. You can walk around until you reach the top also, absolutely stunning. A must for tourists in Singapore."
,,Very impressive building and display,5.0,,"The cloud forest is housed in one of the two domes in the Gardens by the Bay. The other dome houses the Flower dome. The entrance free covers both domes. Considering the popularity of the domes we didn't have to queue to buy our tickets. Of the two domes we found the Cloud Forest the more interesting.

The dome is very large and contains the 35m high waterfall and cloud forest. A lift takes you to the top of the forest and you walk down on walkways. There is a lot to see and a lot of information to take in. With taking lots of photos we spent over 2 hours in the dome.

A must see if visiting the Gardens by the Bay"
,,We wanted to have a great time and we did.,5.0,,This place was very cool & comfortable from the moment we entered. The falls was very beautiful & when the lights come on in the evening it gets more Beautiful.. A very nice place to Visit.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Really loved the cost in the Cloud Forest but be warned if visiting its pretty cold in there and quite wet in parts but the water falls flowers and plants are worth putting up with it. Amazing place
,,A great human achievement,4.0,,"What so great about singapore is that they could make whatever nature didn't give to them. Lack of waves in beach to surfing? Why not made one. Not having a waterfall? Just build one and so on.
Ps. Not only waterfall... The leggo garden also very wonderful here."
,,Huge,5.0,,"Part of the gardens by the bay, cloud forest is artificially built creating different forests ambience. A huge waterfall has been recreated and we can walk all the way up to experience it. It's quite fun and a different feeling altogether."
,,well worth the trip,4.0,,probably one of the highlights of my trip to Singapore. I much preferred it to the flower dome. A helpful hint: it's a bit chilly inside due to the mist and water.
,,Nice,3.0,,It was ok to see but not worth the amount to pay for entry. We walked through it pretty quickly. They say it takes an hour.
,,Amazed by the waterfall and sheer number of plants,5.0,,"If you love plants then you'll be amazed at the number and diversity here. You take a lift up to the top of the waterfall and then take gentle walkways down. If you have mobility problems there is a lift that links all levels as well as escalators. At the moment there is also an exhinition of plants made out of Lego blocks, fun and innovative. Every 2 hours there's a ""misting"" of the plants, it's refreshing rather than drenching. Great for all ages."
,,"Very high and green, lovely",5.0,,"A stunning indoor park, selfies abound. It's a record breaker and definitely should be on your to do list. This city have it right."
,,A must visit for Singapore,5.0,,"If visiting gardens on the bay you must upgrade to see the cloud forest, I don’t like heights but walked over the high ledges with no problems wonderful experience"
,,Part of the gardens by the bay.,5.0,,This can be visited along with the other building that makes up the gardens by the bay. Definitely need to do the pair as they offer completely different feel. I was extremely impressed by them both.
,,Wow,4.0,,Amazing selection of plants on a vertical structure with waterfalls. Worth the money you pay to see this attraction. We happily spent two hours here
,,Superb,5.0,,"This is one of 2 large Domes in Marina Sands Gardens and as the best of the two ( the other is flowers from different Mediterranean type climate regions). The entrance gives you a 'wow' with a large waterfall falling from roof height cascading through cave like structures and succulant foliage. The tour starts from the lift which takes you up to the 6th floor, you then walk to the 7th to start you walk through the mountain regions. I would advise going on the 1/2 hour and taking in the views from the bottom and then the top. WHY, well on the hour the misting system starts up and after a few minutes gives you the impression of being in a cloud on a hillside - a great effect. There were also numerous sculptures around on our visit and there is plenty of information on climate, plants etching around the walkways. Luckily it is not all steps downwards, elevators take you from floor to floor. However don't miss out the film and timeline sequence at the exit. This is a very sobering experience."
,,Unique Indoor Garden and Lush display,5.0,,Be prepared to walk for walking but well worth the journey. The Cloud Forest is one of a kind garden. If you have fear of heights then the walk may bother you as it did my friend.
,,Terrific,5.0,,I walked in and my breathe was taken away with the beauty that stood infront of me this place is a must see
,,Different every time,5.0,,"I always go here when in Singapore and always find it different. There is always small changes which add to the interest. The move of the lego plants to the hidden land on the top floor is much better and interesting to see the carnivorous plants so close.
It is the first time I have been when it is misting time and this really adds to the effects. Great photographs. It changes the atmosphere as well to more mysterious.
Good place to take you time as nobody rushes you around."
,,"Yes, yes, yes",5.0,,You truly must do this. So worth it. Seen nothing like it anywhere in the world. So brilliantly done. Well done Singapore
,,Artificial waterfall and mist,4.0,,"You will see a big waterfall when you enter. It do amazed me but I'm neither like nor dislike, maybe because I prefer the natural waterfall. Same with the misting too.
A great place to photograph. Like the global warming movie and the small orchid garden."
,,Absolutely amazing!,5.0,,"A definite must-see when in Singapore, even if only to escape the humidity. The design and the gardens make it essential visiting."
,,A unique experience.,5.0,,"We bought tickets to both domes and enjoyed them both. The botanical plantings on the waterfall tower are amazing and must be quite a feat maintaining. The area is so large, that it didn't feel crowded despite the hordes heading through the turnstile. Recommend that you buy the ticket to walk up and inside the waterfall tower, it is spectacular and not that strenuous.Wonderful tropical flowers, ferns, orchids etc Photo opportunities every where.Take some bottled water. Clean toilets accessible within the dome."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,We were mesmerized with the lovely view of the cloud forest. The flora and fauna is to be seen to be believed. Artificial mist added tot he charm.
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,Go for the evening lights show (although worth looking at in day time too). Shows are only 10 mins long and are at 7:45 and 8:45. Get there early and sit under the smaller tree to look at the bigger on with the skywalk round it. Light show is a-maze-ing!
,,A nice place to visit,4.0,,"Recommend to visit. Me and my partner liked this side more than the Flower Dome, so we would recommend to visit this side at least. You get to see a nice waterfall and have the chance to get to the top of the waterfall. Feels like a jungle under the dome with some jungle plants."
,,Must do,4.0,,"Its a ticketed area in Gardens by the Bay...there are 2 domes...cloud & flowers. This is the better one I felt. The waterfall at the entrance is inviting. The lift to the top & the views from the top as you walk down the various walkways is awesome.
Recommended"
,,Super Experience,5.0,,"Superbly designed walk from the top of the forest to the lower levels .. Its beautiful .. They take you to the top level and from there it is a walk on a bridge ... If lucky enough with the times you get a foggy scene too .. You get the feel of a real forest right in the middle of a city .. Well planned, designed and implemented"
,,Nice and refreshing,4.0,,"Too hot in Singapore
Go and visit this place instead of the shopping mall
Of course it s an artificial mountain
But it can be good spot for all the family
It s show how our planet is beautiful and fragil
Nice ambiance
Humid, I advice you to have a scarf"
,,Brilliant. Very detailed and informative,5.0,,Incredible and environmentally significant. Amazing job and a must see for any singapore stopover.You will not be dissapointed
,,Stunning and beautiful,5.0,,"From the massive waterfalls to the graceful arched walkways, Cloud Forest is a beauty to behold. I'm not big on flowers but found myself taking about 50 pictures of the most beautiful flowers that I had ever seen. This is a gentle walk down from the top where you can take your time and simply enjoy the natural beauty and artistry of the combinations of plants. You will be transported!"
,,Just beautiful and architectural Wonder,5.0,,"After touring gardens by the bay, went to the cloud forest dome, it’s cool and fresh as you walk in, amazing plants and waterfall and go to the top to see an incredible view and platform walk- wow! Highly recommended and don’t miss!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing green rain forest in artificial dime inside gardens by the bay. One of two domes. Amazing greenery. Very humid
,,interesting,5.0,,the range of greens and flowers is amazing. you are truly in a cloud. It is easy to get around and the views from the walkways are great
,,Neat attraction,5.0,,Very neat set up. It’s a cool combination of the flinstones and the jetsons. Some really neat plants in there
,,Awesome,4.0,,"From The Manmade Waterfall before going up to the Creatively planted Manmade Mountains, the fine mists by the Sprinklers All over the place! The View from the Glass Window All around Singapore! One Wonders About The Ingenious Ideas And Creativity that is just a part of the Cloud Forest! Definitely worth Spending a few hours to visit it! I highly recommend it!"
,,Very well done,5.0,,Exceptionally done. A mountain within a dome covered by vegetation. Take the lift to the top and then come down by stairs and walkways that surround the mountain. Focused on the effect of climate change. Well worth a visit to this excellent display
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"Starting from the waterfall that greets visitors as you enter through the main door and right the way through, the Cloud Forest is stunning. The interwoven nature and man-made structures compliment each other brilliantly.
Only minor issue anywhere - and it is very minor - is the strange focus on stalagmites and stalactites."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The best advice we got was to visit this as early as possible, so we got here at 9am as soon as it was open - well before the tourist buses arrived. We walked all around starting at the very top and working our way down. Almost every step was breathtaking. The plants are so abundant it is impossible to take them all in. Interspersed throughout are numerous wooden sculptures beautifully carved into animal shapes. There is a giant waterfall spraying a cool mist everywhere. This exhibit is sensational - do not miss it."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful to walk through. Bit scary walking along the really high foot bridges but loved how they put the most on and you feel like youre in a rainforest with the waterfall
,,Recomendable,5.0,,"Un paseo agragable por los jardines. Es imprescindible visitar el Jardín Botánico y el Flower Dome. Da una visión concienciadora de cuidar el ecosistema.

A pleasant walk through the gardens. It is essential to visit the Botanical Garden and Flower Dome. It gives an awareness of caring for the ecosystem."
,,wow wow wow,5.0,,"Fantastic views, awesome plants. We only did the rainforest dome due to time restrictions. Absolutely beautiful place, however I have a real fear of heights so even though I did each level I didn't do the walk ways but used the internal stairs"
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Such a Great experience. At the entrance you are meet by a Big waterfall. There are a lot of flowers in many colors. You take a lift to the top of the waterfall and then walk down on a Skywalk. The view is amacing. Really a place you should go. Also accessable for wheelchairs. Tickets at the park entrance or by the Dome. Join entrance to cloud forest and flower Dome is 28 SGD for 1 adult. But skip flower Dome, it is not good. Shuttle from park entrance to domes for 3 SDG. Or just walk, it is only 10 minutes."
,,Love the Waterfall,5.0,,My first time come here and i really love the hidden forest. Nice place and i took a lot of pictures. The cloud forest overall is so pretty and i hope can came back soon.
,,A Must see,5.0,,Dont go to Singapore without checking this place out. Have been twice before and never get sick of it.
,,Amazing Cloud Forest,5.0,,"I think whoever the architect of this great place is a genius. Beautiful place with lots and lots of different types of plants and trees. The sheer magnitude of the structure from which bridges extend out just amazes me. Extremely thrilling to walk on those bridges together with my friends! Thank you to all those working there for keeping this iconic attraction in Singapore clean, attractive, vibrant and highly enjoyable and pleasant to all visitors to the garden!"
,,Amazing Dome in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is an air conditioned dome which can be cold so you might need a sweater or a jacket. You take an elevator up to the top of the man made mountain and waterfall then walk down the spiral walkways. It is very interesting to see the different plants that inhabit the various eco zones around the world. Just wish we had more time there.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Loved our visit here. It's a chance to get up close and personal with many species of tropical plant. But more than that, I felt the big attraction for me was, again, the engineering that created this place. (again, as with the super trees in my review of the Gardens). It's an incredible place, but allow the time, because there's so much to see and linger over. Give this at least 1.5 hours, but the Flower Dome is located right next door, so allow another 1.5 hours for that too."
,,Must visit if you are going to Singapore!,5.0,,This has to be one of the mail attractions of Singapore! It is so out of the world experience and you will be surely left mesmerized with its beauty and architecture. Make sure you have enough time to enjoy the beauty of this marvel while making a visit as this is not a touch and go place to visit.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Fantastic presentation, subtle yet modern, wonderful experience for all. This was the better of the two, tho the Flowers was also worthy of a visit."
,,Unbelievable indoor plant and waterfall display with elevated walkways!,5.0,,"This is one of two indoor air conditioned domes in the Gardens by the Bay. The first is the flower dome. This dome has a huge man made mountain. You take an elevator to the top, then walk down huge elevated walkways. On the journey you see hundreds of plans, flowers, and sculptures representing various ecosystems that would inhabit different elevation habitats around the world. When we visited, there was a huge Lego sculpture at the top showing various carnivorous plants. There are waterfalls, sculptures of animals, and an underground area representing cave like grotto plant environments. This was my favorite of the two domes, but both were amazing. A MUST SEE while in Singapore!!!! It's also so nice to take a break from the heat and enjoy these one of a kind domes!!!!"
,,Cloudy forest with a waterfall,5.0,,We visited both the cloud forest and the flower done and have to say we liked the cloud forest better. The high rising waterfall is a stunning sight and one can get wet if you go under and close enough. You walk part of the way and lift takes care of the rest of the way up to 7th? Floor towards the lost world on the top. From the one counties downwards on walking bridges. Worth a visit.
,,Beautiful and intriguing,4.0,,"While this place is very pretty and interesting, it's sort of a place if you have seen it once, that is good enough. The plants are very pretty though. It's nice."
,,"Paradise looks something like this, I guess",5.0,,"Simple stunning. Considering its hot and humid outside. It amazing how they build this. I specially love the mist. It so beautiful and yeah do go with your loved one, its romantic. Some of the artworks are outstanding. Special mention Rush of Nature."
,,A great attraction worth a visit,5.0,,As part of our sia card visited gardens and 2 conservatories including cloud forest. Great to visit and walk around the building which was very impressive. Go to top and work way down.
,,O 2 Refresh,5.0,,The place for refreshing O2 after long journey from thousand mile. Good place for exhale your breathe.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Part of the Garden by the Bay complex, a spectacular dome full of tropical rain forest plants. The aerial walkway was superb."
,,Lovely and refreshing,5.0,,"After walking from the Singapore Flyer to the mall, followed by a walk to the Grove and Flower dome, this was refreshing. Seeing photos prior to our visit made the trip first hand exciting. It was easily accessible with kids and a stroller. There were a ton of people milling about so some areas were tight."
,,Getting away from the sun,5.0,,"Cloud forest is colder than the outside temperature, with big waterfall right next to the entrance. A fine mist spreading and many greenery hanging off walls."
,,A very enjoyable experience,5.0,,"Bought entrance tickets to both conservatories for S$28 each to get us into here and the Flower Dome. The Cloud Forest is a great experience with some fantastic living walls, a high indoor waterfall and a well thought out route through it all."
,,So beautiful,4.0,,You will loose yourself in this amazing area. It's huge and so unpredictable! Allow at least 2 hours!
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,This is a must-see atraction. I has to be seen to be believed. I even has a waterfall included in the structure.
,,Easier to visit than the Amazon,5.0,,Visiting a rain forest in its natural habitat is expensive and inconvenient. This is the next best thing and not to be missed.
,,It's like being in the high jungle clouds,5.0,,"This is the most spectacular greenhouse we have ever visited. Attention to detail is fantastic and the number of species to view at many altitudes is tremendous. The low entry price ($14 pp, I think) is extremely good value - you could easily pass half a day in this facility, being both delighted and educated."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This would be a good activity to do in any weather as it is all covered and air conditioned It was beautiful and peaceful. Easy to get to and plenty to do within walking distance
,,Just beauiful,5.0,,I found this just beautiful. It wasn't expensive and the temp was beautiful in side . I would recommend this to all my friends. Spend a few hours here its worth it and a big area to cover.
,,Something different!,5.0,,Cloud forest was something truly special. The flowers were very beautiful and the waterfall really cool. The elevator took you to the top and from there you could walk down through the different sections. Highly recommend a visit here!

,,Tallest waterfall,5.0,,"We love visiting the cloud forest, there are so many species of plants here that it's kind of mind-blowing. Everything is well organized and there is a good flow to this attraction.

Along with lots of beautiful plants and flowers the cloud forest also has the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. It's quite a sight"
,,Definitely worth visiting,5.0,,"Beautiful creations, walking pathways and amazing views - this is all you can find in this attraction. Great for all people of all ages and cultures. Waterfall is the most impressive part of this and you can view it from different heights. Must see."
,,visited this week,5.0,,"Beautiful, luxurious eye-rich experience of a lifetime...a definite visit with your friends & family, if you are in Singapore"
,,Breathless,5.0,,What a wonderful creation. While enter I become breathless . Can’t express the feelings. So decorated that you will think you are on a natural place.
,,Marvelous place to visit,5.0,,"This is an unique garden experience. We have to buy tickets for separate domes, but each are valued. You can spend whole day if you want. Can have small snacks inside,"
,,Big tourist attraction,5.0,,If your into plants and flowers etc etc then its well the entrance fee. If your not into that stuff there is literally nothing else to do. Very good displays though.
,,A must visit and not to be missed.,5.0,,Bought 2 domes and worth every penny. Spent a whole day with the family here. Nice place for young and old besides being wheelchair friendly.
,,"Just amazing, made me smile!",5.0,,"The best garden experience ever! So much to see. Great of you like to take photos, even better if you are a gardener."
,,Worth a look,5.0,,"We called in after looking out of the gardens from the Marina Bays hotel. It's a great place to take in nature at her best. Great displays, well labelled and well worth a look."
,,Stunning,5.0,,My wife and I went here directly after visiting the Gardens by the Bay. Walking in and feeling that cool air with the spray from the waterfall was firstly breathtaking and then refreshing. What an amazing idea to be able to promote so many parts of the plant kingdom and make it creative and exciting. Well deserving of 5 stars
,,My fav place in Singapore,5.0,,"If I had to pick my fav attraction/ activity/ place in Singapore, this would be it! You simply can’t and shouldn’t miss this! I’m not sure how many other places have something like this or if any exist at all, but even so, this is a must visit and should be right up there in things to do in your itinerary, if it ain’t then please get it included!
Late evening is probably the best time to go here as they turn on the lights which gives a different aura to the flora and fauna there.
The temperature inside is a bit on the cooler side and you might want to get children dressed accordingly.
The first sight you are greeted as soon as you enter is the HUGE waterfall which is simply amazing and a great photo shoot area. They have ramps built around and over the place to give you a feel of different kinds of vegetation across different levels/ heights.
Just follow the route, keep your cameras ready and enjoy the raw beauty!"
,,Must see,5.0,,If visiting Singapore you must visit the gardens by the bay and head to coud forest. You have to pay to enter but it's well worth it.
,,Get there early to avoid the selfie brigade,5.0,,You'll spend a lot of time admiring the splendour of this place. You'll also spend a lot of time dodging people taking selfies and close-up photographs of flower buds. Get their early to avoid the crowds and enjoy the natural serenity of the dome.
,,Amazing !!,5.0,,"Truly one of the most amazing tourist sites I’ve ever visited, best seen at night! If you only have a short time in Singapore this is a must see, don’t miss the amazing waterfall and amazing forrest in the clouds"
,,Beautiful glassed in botanic garden,5.0,,Staying in Marina bay sands looking down at this just had to go. Glad I did amazing indoor huge botanic garden with beautiful plants & a big waterfall. It has a walkway that winds up to the top - I have a fear of heights especially on grid type walkways like this was - but I decided to go for it I was fine till 3/4 way up then I looked down & froze for a minute . Ran up the rest of it & got the lift down - despite my ‘issue’ it is beautiful & I’m glad I went. There is a little train that you can pay to get to take you back to a near MBS hotel f you need it l
,,Well created,4.0,,"Next to the marina bay sands, this artificial forest with plants and waterfalls has been created well."
,,Forest in a City,5.0,,"This attraction is part of Garden by the Bay. This staggering greenhouse-like glass dome can be seen from miles away, and is just as stunning inside as it is from out. The entry tickets are generally bought along with the Flower Dome located nearby."
,,Back with the kids in tow,4.0,,"It was a wet and rainy weekend in Singapore and so we decided to make use of the Gardens membership we obtained a few months back to visit here with the kids in tow. Arriving early is the trick to avoid long queues, and at around 9am on a Sunday there weren't any issues. Managed to keep the kids entertained for an hour in the cloud forest and then also visit the other dome. Free parking with your gardens membership!"
,,Absolutely not to be missed,5.0,,"This pavilion at the Gardens by the Bay is not to be missed. It was an excellent rainy day activity that exceeded our expectations. Wonderfully set up, easy to navigate and lots to see. The flowers, trees and all displays were stunning.

It is quite cool in there so if you are prone to being chilly you should take a wrap!"
,,A must see,5.0,,"Allow plenty of time to explore the two domes located in Gardens by the Bay. Very well done but you must keep your eye out for hidden treasures within the plants. The plants are very healthy from beautiful orchids through to maiden hair ferns. The water feature as soon as you enter will show you that you are in for a great experience. While it is very hot and humid outside the temperature inside is perfect. I would rate this as a must see if you only have a few days in Singapore. Easy access via MRT and for $3.00 the shuttle service is good value, especially if you have walked a lot. Seniors discounts only apply for local residents"
,,Very lovely place,5.0,,"Musst see for every Flowers lovers, so many different kinds of flowers, nice to walk downstairs on some kind of hanging stairs/way, nice waterfall, beautiful view on Singapur Marina Bay Sands... to go alone and relax, to go with your children, friends.. Educative videos on the first floor about global warming, about carrying about nature..."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is really beautiful! Lots of hidden wooden figures and beautiful flowers. But the Highlight was the walk from the top.
,,Unique,5.0,,"The other dome in the Gardens by the Bay - a rain forest. Every 2 hours they set off a mist which creates clouds - so interesting to sit and watch. Like the other dome, there are plants from all over the world. I had never seen a woolly cactus! And the section cleverly named “Aloes in Wonderland “ complete with figures from Alice in Wonderland. There was a section with plants like the Venus Flytrap accompanied by Legos built to look like the flowers. Again, I highly recommend visiting if you have any interest in botany - or just enjoy seeing such a unique attraction."
,,Gasp in amazement as you walk through the entrance,4.0,,"This is a great venue to visit, try to visit in the evening when you get a new perspective on everything. The main attraction is the waterfall, which is the first feature you see as you enter, not certain if it is the spectacular view, or just the cool air-conditioning that makes everyone gasp as they enter"
,,City Within A City,4.0,,"China Town has a chracter of its own. The shops offer varied stuff right from food to gifts to clothes to other interesting stuff. The energy level and vibrancy is at a different level. Very well organized and laid out market. Options are amazing without much of a clutter. As a visitor, you have every right to reconfirm the deal as some vendors here ""claim"" that they are not conversant with English.

In close vicinity, there is Buddha Tooth Relic Temple which is must visit.

Happy Shopping."
,,"Very good, don’t miss this out.",5.0,,"Loads to see in this dome, cool and comfortable inside and very informative and imaginative. Brilliant cloud walks."
,,Nice waterfall and interesting plants,3.0,,Good to discover most of the plants existing in the forest. One thing I dislike was freezing inside.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Highlight of our Gardens by the bay tour. Fantastic waterfall & the different 5 levels giving loads of information. Great environmental messages throughout. Beautiful & cool best during the heat of the day
,,Nothing to see,2.0,,"Always been curious about this-- it was actually nothing. Looked at it for about 30 seconds, and that was enough. Just why. why. Why."
,,A must see attraction.,4.0,,The cloud forest in the gardens by the bay are fabulous. It is an artificial rain forrest within a huge greenhouse. It has all the flowers you would get in a rain forest from the lowest in the forest floor level to those at the highest level. A huge waterfall is central and you can walk up. down and around the different levels. It makes you appreciate how high and colourfull rain forrests are.
,,Indoor wonder,5.0,,"Having only limited time in this fantastic city, we decided to spend one day visiting the Gardens bythe Bay. The Cloud Forest was our first starting point. It was out of this world, it has got to be a must on any visit to Singapore."
,,The name Says it all,5.0,,"Its a Forest in the midst of a Botanical garden and on top of it inside a Huge Dome! What more do you need in a Forestcity of Skyscrapers? Epic promenade through the whole thing, feels like life is not planted but kept in there!"
,,Spectacular gardens,5.0,,A garden wonderland with so many species and magnolias the size of plates!!! The tiered gardens are magnificent.
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,Such an beautiful place and so typically Singapore. Head up to the cloud walk and make your way down from the top if you are okay with heights. We went on a Sunday evening and it was quite busy but still worth it. Plenty of places to wander around in the gardens when you are done.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Singapore is great at making something an attraction that you normally wouldn't find interesting!

The cloud forest is basically a giant vertical garden with indoor waterfall. Some very interesting and pretty plants. And it's very cool inside, a great way to escape the heat for an hour!"
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Another "" must see"".This structure/forest is unreal.Must be appreciated,considering how much effort has been put into this project.My favourite were flowering trees/bushes,but olive trees are remarkable. Size of their trunks will tell you they are very old.
Singapore in whole was excellent experience.
Travellers should have at least few days stopover,it is worth it. Food,venues,Marina,zoo,etc.Can't list them all.I would call Singapore The Gem of Asia"
,,An artificial Oasis but everything is real,5.0,,"This fully enclosed and temperature controlled conservatory - it is a world with high mountains, waterfalls, exotic plants and a skywalk. If you want to escape the heat and humidity of Singapore then this is the place to be. There is a lovely cafe but must book in advance."
,,Man Made falls!,5.0,,This is such a wonderful place to go to. imagine a man-made fall at the center of an island. Just the sound of falling water will relax your mind while inside the Cloud Forest. Brilliant Idea
,,Cool retreat during hot days in Singapore,5.0,,This is a gem in Gardens by the bay. The artificial waterfall was too good. Mist created by it was enjoyable. Can spend a whole hour leisurely roaming this place.
,,Creative cloud forest visit,5.0,,"This dome is very different to the flower garden. When we visited it was raining outside with thunder and lightening and this may have added to our experience! This garden includes a waterfall and a walkway that takes you into the canopy, allowing you to see different layers of the forest. There are also displays within the garden that add to it. Misting takes place every couple of hours (eg when we were there at 4pm) and it is worth being there for that to see the cloud forest through the mist."
,,Freaking awesome!,5.0,,I really think it's one experience at marina park. See my TA reviews. It's GREAT all together as one night. I would not separate them.
,,Wet,5.0,,Once you step inside you get the full impact of the waterfall a top experience kids loved walking around and getting wet
,,Amazing Creation,5.0,,"Its so amazing to see a cloud forest inside a building with so many kinds of plants in it. It was wonderful to see the rainfall inside the cloud forest,"
,,Amazing,5.0,,You must visit this! Wow wow wow! Incredible construction and wonderful plants. When its hot outside go there to cool down.
,,Encounter the world's tallest indoor waterfall .....,5.0,,Explore the highlands amidst orchids and ferns from the cool moist tropical region. The 35 meters indoor waterfall is amazing to see at the Cloud Forest.
,,Great place,5.0,,This is one of the attractions at gardens by the bay and is well worth it. The cloud forest has a walkway which is high I have vertigo but did manage to walk round it but would have still been glad I gone inside even if I had found it too high. Would recommend.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,fantastic place to visit full of weird and wonderful sites and amazing views from the top of the man-made waterfalls
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"What a spectacular place to visit!
The indoor waterfall is just phenomenal and all the different plants and flowers you see is beyond beautiful.
Very well laid out and easy walkways make the experience that much better.
World class attraction and a must visit when in Singapore."
,,Heaven on the Earth,5.0,,"I was absolutely mesmerized by the beauty as I entered the cloud forests. Tremendously beautiful, this is a must visit place in Singapore. Sadly I had no clue about this beauty before and I went there around 8 and it was dark.slready. I wish I knew about it before. You better go there by 6 pm so that you can enjoy the beauty both in the sunlight and the night lights. I stayed in the cloud forest for around an hour and wish I could stay there for more time. The place shuts at 9 and they literally take everyone out of the premises sharp at 9. While I enjoyed the view in night lights too but could get some good and clear pictures from my phone.
There are seven storys as in levels of this wonderful indoor garden and make sure you visit all of them. The lift as far as I remember goes till 3rd floor then you have walk along which is a breathtaking sight.
They also show a movie on a big screen telling you about the cloud forest, which unfortunately I wasn't able to see because I was late already and wanted to enjoy the scenic beauty more.
Just sit, relax and enjoy the beauty and ambiance here. Keep your phones aside and relax..thank me later :)"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"S$14 each got us access to this very special place. I'm no biologist but the variety of fauna on display in the initial sections was something to behold. The man-made waterfall is very impressive and the way the walkways are done through the different trees and plants is also.

There is also an exhibition on sustainability which puts together issues we all know about in an interesting and user-friendly manner.

Well worth a visit. Presently the equivalent of £9 for about 1.5 hours with doubtless high maintenance costs - I hate to think what this would cost back in the UK."

,,Very beautiful and breath taking,5.0,,Minimum 3 - 4 hours required in peace to enjoy the complete forest with excellent water falls and lot of places for memorable photography
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,We visited this straight after the Flower Dome. BE WARNED it is cold inside. Take a light jacket and or a shower jacket. It is definitely worth the visit - it's something different.
,,Not a must visit,3.0,,"If you only have time for one dome, just go to the flower dome.... this cloud forest is cooling,nothing much to view either..."
,,Great vision and passion for details,5.0,,"This is a perfect example of how things are done in Singapore. Everything is visionary, and crafted with a lot of passion and love.

,,Amazing,4.0,,"If you are interested in nature, this is a most. This is an in door rain forest including water falls, you will feel like you are out doors."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Simply loved our visit to cloud forest. Didn't know what to expect and apart from being a welcome break from the midday sun it was simply stunning and cool. You are greater by a waterfall and the wonders continue with the most exquisite collection of orchids and other flowers that I'd ever seen. I'm sure we spent two hours ambling round stopping and watching the world go.by. please don't touch the flowers tho or enter the flower beds for selfies, it's selfish and signposted everywhere not to do it so please refrain as i'm sure the teams work very hard at keeping it so precious. Worth every penny."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I loved it but if your husband/ partner is afraid of of heights, it is a no go zone! We tried but height was an. Issue!"
,,A must-see place!,5.0,,All friends of nature should go there on their visit to Singapore. The site is very well done and well maintained. From misty areas to the wanterfall as well as the massive amount of wonderful orchids are not to be missed!
,,Beautiful indoor garden experience,5.0,,"We loved our visit to the Cloud Forest. The structure is amazing as is the overall concept of the indoor garden. It was very busy when we were there but we still enjoyed the experience. At certain times the watering system ""misting"" would come on. This was good to see and we took some great photos with the mist also. The views at the top of the Cloud Forest out to the city were also fantastic. I would definitely recommend a visit."
,,WOW,5.0,,"When we visited Marina Bay Sands we couldn't wait to see the flower dome and the cloud dome! They certainly lived up to what they had been said to be! Stunning, beautiful and gorgeous are three words to describe the forest. We instantly felt calmed and relaxed inside even though we were surrounded by people."
,,This is a must,5.0,,What more can I say You must do this it’s amazing Great for families walks outside are free For a small fee you can get the tram around
,,Amazing construction,5.0,,A very nice place for a walk through (a little bit artificial) nature. But the construction is amazing.
,,Amazing!! Loved it,5.0,,This is a must in Singapore if you like plants. It was truly amazing. Would recommend it early morning or later in afternoon.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,Cloud forest has been an amazing experience. It felt as if I was really walking through the clouds. However the cloud isn't always available so make sure of the time you visit the place. All plant lovers should visit this place. Its also one of the cheapest attractions of Singapore. It will cost you only SGD16.00. Its totally worth it.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The cloud forest is an impressive display of plant and flower species from all over the world. The stucture itself is quite impressive too. There are walkways which are quite high up - not for those who fear heights perhaps, but well worth the views! It can get chilly inside, so bring a light wrap. Some stunning flower displays!"
,,Very nice concept and well maintained,4.0,,It is a very nice concept and very well maintained... you get to see variety of plants and also get excellent feel about the place .. the place comes to light at evening and looks wonderful... must visit while in Singapore because you will not find it elsewhere.

,,Great engineering feat,5.0,,"My favourite dome, always beautiful, stunning waterfall, and plants get there about two pm when the misting starts, incredible experience as cloud drift across lake on top story !"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"I think this is THE visit in Singapore. The cloud forest takes you up through the different levels of mountain forests through a clever climate layering in the huge dome. The sky walk around the mountain is spectacular, but you need a head for heights!"
,,You have to see it!!!!,5.0,,"The attraction makes an amazing impression. Microclimate. Unsurpassed vegetation, waterfalls can not be tarnished, you have to see it. Fantastic construction, the smell of the lift is unforgettable. Wonder"
,,A good place for nature-loving people,5.0,,"As the place says , it is a huge cloud forest with a waterfall which gives a cooling effect inside. Many different species of flowers can be seen here.

,,Cloud Forest Amazing,5.0,,"Wow what a beautiful idea. Breathtaking orchids and ferns, every turn had something exotic and interesting. Loved this experience didn’t want to leave. Just like being in a rainforest incredible structure and creativity. Very peaceful felt like I was in the tropics somewhere. A must visit in Singapore"

,,Nice waterfall and walk from top to bottom,4.0,,"A lot being shown in a packed capsule. Great brains have worked behind this. A definate place to visit. You will have to take a lift and go to the top of the waterfall and then step down floor by floor to explore the entire area. Also, go to the basement floor as well."
,,Refreshing and amazing,5.0,,Incredible what planning can do for tourism. A magnificent indoor garden with gorgeous displays and waterf eatures to cool you down from the humidity outside - refreshing!
,,I love the cloud forest. Best wear a jacket,5.0,,"Very beautiful attraction. Its cold and damp in this place. It has elevators to go up to the higher levels . On the 7 floor is the ""Lost World"" exhibit with venus fly traps and trumpet plants. It features a series of sky walks where you can view the rainforest from up top. Good and safe place to battle your fear of heights"
,,Garden of Eden in a Singapore Capsule,5.0,,"This Singapore in a capsule of ecology, biology, botany and technology, a wonderful two hour stroll in the Singapore version of the Garden of Eden."
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,excellent place to spend your evenings. beautiful surrounding & great colors all over. Must see the colorful decoration at night
,,Magical garden,4.0,,Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay is a magical garden. you feel like you entry a whole new world. best to visit early morning to avoid the crowd
,,Absolutely wonderful,5.0,,"This is a must for any visitor to Singapore. It really is an amazing place, so cool and beautiful with a waterfall you can actually walk behind and the views from the top are spectacular."
,,Must see.,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience visiting this magnificient display of plants and flowers, along with the stalagtites and examples of what a cave would look like."
,,Avatar by the Bay,5.0,,"Crazy mix of fantasy, ecology, biology, and technology. This is Singapore in a capsule. Brilliant two hour stroll. A delight for the senses, a message to humankind and just sort of fun."
,,amazing,5.0,,"My wife and I just walked up and bought a ticket ,no queues at all ,this is one amazing venue you walk in and the first thing you notice is the drop in temp from say 30+C to 24 we spent a few hrs here and totally enjoyed it ,there are a huge range of plants, carvings, stalactites,and tons of things to see as you walk around ,dont rush ,just enjoy.
Unfortunately the flower dome was closed the day we went"
,,A walk in the clouds,4.0,,"If you love plants and a walk in the mist then this is the place, even if the plants doesn't entice then atleast you have a cooling weather to calm you down. Step in to the world of plants including the carnivorous ones...."
,,WOW.. a Different world,5.0,,"I been there on my solo trip to singapore.. was very much curious to see the cloud forest as i was wondering how one can create a cloud in a dome .. but on visiting this amazing place i fell in love with the place .. it is very beautiful & give a very natural feel as if you are amidst the nature in the mountains.. the waterful is simply fantastic.. everything there made me say "" WOW """
,,Just the same as Gardens by the Bay,3.0,,"If you are a botanist, interest in plants, go for it - perhaps you might like it a lot. But other than that, it is just a big glass dome which is seriously and strongly air-conditioned and then a number of exotic plants in this case on display. The funny part is at one of the topmost level, they also have artificial plants (made with lego) on display near the real ones (at least I hope they are real). Didn't know the logic of that though. Why use lego bricks to make plants and call them exotic and lost world? Perhaps they are in a better place to explain.
Attend this place, if you have time and money, otherwise, you are not missing much, let me tell you that. Perhaps, a place to tick off the Singapore list of place and nothing more than that."
,,Fairy tale??,5.0,,"It would be false if I say I spent my day in a fairy tale. This artificial waterfall forest is one of the most amazing places i’ve seen. It is a must do if you’re visiting SG.
Best part is that it is Airconditioned inside so no worries about the weather outside.
Ticket costs 28S$ for cloud forest and flower dome, both.
Don’t rush amd spend good time in the forest."
,,A lovely way to spend a few hours in Singapore,5.0,,"We loved our visit here; we purchased the ticket for both the Cloud dome and the flower dome and would recommend both.
The cloud dome has a spectacular waterfall on entering (so don't bring in anything you don't want to get a little water spray on), and then you walk around the dome and up to a walkway via lifts. Once on the walkway it winds back down to ground level, offering the chance to see all the plants up close.
Although there are lifts for push chairs and wheelchair users the walkways were a little bit harder to navigate for the families we saw with push chairs during our visit, although they completed the dome with no issues.
I had trainers on and found the floor quite slippery, so keep that in mind when choosing footwear. Parts of the walk way you can see down straight to the floor which can also be scary for some.
However none of these things were an issue for us, we loved strolling through the dome and thought the ticket entry was very good value for money.
We saw the rest of the gardens at night (entry is free to the garden area and we watched the free light show) and came back in the day time for the two domes.

A must see when in Singapore!"
,,Lets build a giant dome and make a waterfall,5.0,,The whole area is sensational and shows what can be done when imagination and money come together. Loved it.
,,Awesome!,4.0,,"This is one of the coolest attractions, I've visited in Singapore. Reasonably cheep and a must see on your trip!"

,,Excellent attraction in the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,It houses lots of species and has a spring where you can have a sky walk over a small foot bridge and offers a view of the Marina Bay area .
,,Amazing indoor forest with waterfall..,5.0,,"This is one part of Garden by the bay. You will need 1.5 hours to finish this place’s view.
It is manmade forest and giant waterfall in entrance. You need to see various stages of flora and fauna with Crystal park also.
Walk through levels of flowers and see beauty of nature.
Must see part at Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Really great place to spend an afternoon. (And to get out of the heat) We took some amazing photos of the waterfall and surroundings!
,,Amazing display,4.0,,"Worth seeing for the internal waterfall and plant display. Really well done, It's part of the Gardens by the Bay complex, so it gives you another place to visit."
,,Indoor Waterfall,5.0,,I was truly mesmerised by the beauty of this place and the indoor waterfall. It gets prettier by the dawn coupled with lights around it.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Words cannot describe the beauty and the grandeur of this special place. A MUST-DO whenever you visit this amazing city.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"We went to the Eden Project in the south west of England and came out thinging this is awesome but on coming out of here we were like ""Why didn't the Eden project be as bold as this spectacular place"""
,,Outstanding but do not take the 18:15pm booking,4.0,,"We should of booked the early tour at 14:00pm as by the time we got there, the sun was going down and I really think we would of got a lot more out of this if the sun was shining through the roof. All in all, totally awesome and a must see."
,,Must see,5.0,,This is a must see and clearly one of the highlights of Singapore. Personally I prefer the cloud forest more than the garden. You need approx. 30mins. Very well organised and friendly employees.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Awesome waterfall. Fantastic walk around. Excellent experience, nothing like this back in Perth. Must see!!!!"
,,This is the Garden by the Bay..,5.0,,The setting inside this glass dome ( a big Green house) is beautiful.. the feel of a forest with water falls... worth a visit
,,Refreshing,5.0,,"We had a very long layover in Singapore so decided to venture out into the city for half a day. We didn't want to do both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forrest so we only did the Cloud Forrest, and it was great. It was nice and cool in there which was a refreshing change from the heat outside. There a really nice view from the top, and the flowers are so pretty."
,,Outstanding and Must Visit Destination,5.0,,"I do not have words to explain how I felt there, it makes you forget that you are in a man made attraction, the giant man made waterfall gives an impression that you are inside a jungle and it is a natural waterfall. Unbelievable and Mesmerizing Atmosphere. Must Visit."
,,Simply amazing place,4.0,,Man made trees and waterfall. Varieties of trees and flower. It gives feeling that you are in hill and clouds ⛅️. Lively atmosphere. Great colours of 💐 flowers. Simply awesome
,,Tropical wonderland,5.0,,This is what gardens of the future could look like! Feels like you’ve steeped into a sci-fi movie set of a utopian futuristic garden! Excellent therapy for drought scarred Californians.
,,Great experience - go at night!,5.0,,"There are two conservatories to see in the Gardens by the Bay. I was not very impressed with the Flower Dome but the Cloud Forest made up for it. Unfortunately, you cannot buy a ticket for just one of the domes. We started at the Flower Dome, which was disappointing because I was expecting to see more native flowers. The Cloud Dome was the real winner. Definitely recommend going at night. We arrived around sunset and the experience just got better and better. This is also an excellent place to escape the Signapore heat!"
,,Manmade Marvel,5.0,,"With the highest manmade waterfall in the world this The cloud forest is truely jawdropping beautiful with its thousands of flowers, plants and orchids. take a walk through the forest to enjoy its beauty."

,,Excellent,5.0,,Loved this place Such wonderful plant species so interesting Architecture was outstanding too. Lifts available for strollers and wheel chairs Every City should have a Cloud Forest !
,,Vegetation like never before,5.0,,"The concept of a cooled botanical garden is something which was alien to me and what I experienced in the cloud dome was beyond brilliant. When you enter that waterfall coming down amidst layers of created Amazonian forest is too much to comprehend. The beauty, majesty, splendor is way beyond comprehension."
,,Beautiful and Educational,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens, this is the most adult and educational of the options on the site. The audioguide will talk about some plants but really is not all that informative."
,,Simply Awesome,4.0,,"Simply beautiful. Worth a visit. Visit if u love n care about nature.
QFeels like you are in forest. It spreads a awareness of how important nature is for this planet. We have already done enough damage. Plant more trees.

Well maintained tourist spot. Also have other places to visit nearby.
Should had plenty on time to visit. I would say keep a day seperate for this.

Tickets are little over priced."
,,Magical,5.0,,"Beautiful, highly recommended, kids will have a ball. The artwork is amazing, the gardens are amazing.

Must see every floor, every corner.

,,Nice place with artificial clouds and a big waterfall,5.0,,The place gives u ea really nice feeling as you climb up the stairs and explore the flowers and vegetation. You also get to walk among the clouds or mist which is artificially made to preserve the ecosystem. The waterfall at the entrance is huge and beautiful.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Great place. Must visit. Value for money. The visit to the waterfalland then the walk down is fun though would have loved some walk around the waterfall on the way down
,,In the Clouds,5.0,,"Nothing short of STUNNING! It's one of those attractions that once you step in, your jaw will drop and it's just .. WOW! It's the largest man made waterfall in the world and has the most gorgeous arrangement of tropical floras and faunas. I could spend a day just admiring the view!"

,,Amazing!,4.0,,Some fantastic plants to see in this great greenhouse! Really worth the visit to the Botanic Gardens by the Bay.
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,The coolness in this dome in great and the waterfall is impressive from the moment you walk in. The walk round the dome has many surprises and there is a lift to the very top. A pleasant way to cool off in the heat.
,,Good for a visit once a year,4.0,,"In a country where you have only three forms of weather (hot and humid, very hot and humid and raining and humid), this enclosure can give you respite from the outside weather for the imte you are in. The waterfall is actually a great construct and it's fun to explore the walk as well. lots of photo opportunities etc., but mostly for me it was the respite from outside weather.
It can get very crowded during weekends, so be aware of timings."
,,"Very cool, even clod",5.0,,"Great display of plants, well put together with a beautiful waterfall and lots of things from caves (don't touch!!!). Was a bit crowded, you have to wait maybe 15 minutes to take elevator to top. Great stop before going to see the light show."
,,On cloud nine...,5.0,,The cloud forest was like revisiting my childhood spent in the lap of nature amidst wild plants and ferns in their natural environment. It was exhilarating to point out all rare plants to my city born son. The place simply lives up to its name to every syllable.
,,Magical,5.0,,When you are inside its feels like completely different planet 🌍 well maintained must visit if ur in Singapore
,,"If youre not afraid of heights, this is worth the walking around on suspended walkways over the garden sections",4.0,,An inspiring place to visit. the waterfall creates a tiered microclimate you can visit by using the elevators or walking around and around up to the top. Photo opportunities a plenty. I loved watching the window cleaners on the glass dome.
,,Cloud Forest,3.0,,"Very relaxing, bu if you have a fear of heights you will not get the full benefit of the Forest. I went in with my husband and waited downstairs whilst he saw the forrest on top."
,,Magical trip,5.0,,Don’t miss ... just visit this n gardens by the bay n flower done ... cloud dome is definitely to be visited.. gardens by the bay r magical... flower dome has flowers n trees from different regions of the world
,,Spectacular,5.0,,We spent a couple of hours here but easily could spend more time .Every where you look there are surprises. Beautifully cool and inviting
,,"Take your time here, and use the elevated walks!",5.0,,"Plan to spend 1-2 hours here. Take your time to see all there is. This is an enclosed, climate controlled, ecosystem. The elevated walks give you different perspectives, and there are explanations of cloud and rain forests, as well as information about how and why many of these systems are disappearing. Take a good camera."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,Beautiful place with excellent plants and views. Amazing place - typical of Singapore to do something in grand style!
,,Marvellous wonders of natures best gifted plants,5.0,,"Excellent collection of plants landscaped with brilliant heights surrounding the dome of heights, cloud seeding was a wonderous sight"

Must Visit, Temperature controlled environment. Bring your own water. It is cheaper. If you have vertigo, just be careful. Regards Dr Sim"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Singapore does these attractions so well. A worthwhile excursion for all ages. We look forward to visiting again in the future.
,,so worth it,5.0,,"What they have done here is truly magic. Hidden gems everywhere, whether it's plants or the artwork - make sure your phone/camera is fully charged : )"
,,Up in the clouds!,5.0,,"Well worth spending the money to visit this attraction. Suggest that you bring water with you! A fair bit of walking involved to see the many interesting gardens on display. The flowers, mostly orchids are fantastic. When you go up in the lift you are in the clouds with the waterfall gushing down; amazing."
,,Beautiful and impressive.,5.0,,"This is a must see for Singapore. It is simply stunning. The architecture alone is enough to warrant a visit but, you are spoiled inside with absolutely stunning displays of plants and flowers. All five of us enjoyed this including a fractious 8 year old. Can be a bit crowded but, if you take your time the crowd has lulls and disperses so you can enjoy everything."
,,Cooling Rainforest,4.0,,"Nicely done and there are a couple of levels you can explore. It's got a man-made feel though but nevertheless, nice to be around nature and in an airconditioned area."
,,Truly impressive experience,5.0,,You really get the impression of being in a rain forest here. Its the best of its kind I have visited
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,"So much to like, the tallest indoor waterfall, the misting, the creation of a man made rainforest - as my wife said, if you are going to trash the environment, far better to do it in this environment than the real rain forests around the world. Beautiful flowers such as the colourful orchids."
,,Lazy Sunday afternoon,5.0,,I cannot imagine a better way to spend an afternoon than strolling around here. So relaxing and peaceful it is a wonderful way to de-stress beats the gym anyway.
,,good place to chill out on a hot day,4.0,,the tallest indoor waterfall. It was cool inside. We can walk around man made mountain and enjoy the view from the top. There are alot of rare orchids on display.
,,"Wow, the tallest indoor waterfall",5.0,,"Cloud Forest replicates the cool most tropical Montane region with orchids, pitcher plants and ferns on display. We were amazed when we saw and later travelled up, the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. The waterfall at 35 metres tall adds to the exotic touch and is truly a place for plant enthusiasts. We even found a Bride having Wedding photos here."
,,Fantastic Day,5.0,,This is a beautiful Garden and truly a wonderful way to spend a few hrs. Take your time and spend a few hrs and walk your way through this magnificent garden.
,,Beautiful and well designed,5.0,,An amazing place to visit if you are in Singapore. Love this place and I will surely go back many times to take more pictures
,,Worth Place to Visit,5.0,,"Wroth it...... nice breeze of the waterfall is touch my face, bridge, nice view, prepare your camera because so many place that you must take a photo of it, and don't forget to visit the gallery tho"
,,A hidden Gem,5.0,,"Dont forget to visit Cloud Forest....this will give you a chilling feeling because of the breathtaking views and cooler temperature inside the dome. There are hanging walking bridge that are really up high but completely safe, from up above you can see the entire metropolitan og Singapore which are amazing. Worth a visit. You just have to pay a small amount for the entrance fee though. It will take you about 30minutes to 1hour to walk in through the entire dome."
,,Definitely worth visiting,5.0,,"Entry tickets to the place seems a bit expensive, especially if you are a foreigner and come from a country that's way below Singapore currency value wise. But it was a trip worth every dollar. You get a better deal if you buy the combo ticket for the Cloud forest and the Flower dome. It takes about two hours to see all the levels and enjoy the ambience. I felt that there could have been a little bit more information given about the flora at each level.
Tip: Take the stairs to go to the top of the tower. It's not too much. There is a loooong queue waiting for the elevator. If you took the four (three?) flights of stairs to the top, you would be half way down the tower in the time it takes to wait in the queue."
,,Why the blaring bright lights at night?,3.0,,"This place is absolutely incredible. The different floors you walk through make it feel as though you are ascending through a real 'cloud forest'.

One thing I do not understand, I have visited here many times across the years, and upon visiting this year, I see that extremely bright shining lights have been installed on all bridges and walk ways. At night this used to be a very special place in the dim light/dark - now the lights are so bright that at night time it just feels very... artificial, the mystique and atmosphere, ruined.

Please dim the lights at night again, add back the mist coming from the walkways."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Was a brilliant day, we easily spent an hour here maybe longer. So much to see and for all ages. The staff were really helpful too."
,,Flower mountain,5.0,,Lovely to cool off and see everything this place has to offer. Lots of different flora and information points. Impressive waterfall and cool to have the city backdrop
,,A very Good place,4.0,,Excellent concept and well executed. Its a very good concept the waterfall is amazing. The only issue is lift and people with Prams and stroller. Some places the lift is not available
,,Super cool,5.0,,I love things that are odd. A huge waterfall inside a glass egg with numerous different eco systems in it fits the bill. Definitely worth it. Plus it's nice and cool in here.
,,Wonderful visit,5.0,,Cloud Forest is the most amazing place. You are greeted by a huge indoor waterfall. As you walk gently upwards the plants and shrubs are beautifully kept with interesting and informative information provided along the way. A lift takes you to the top of the dome and on each level as you walk down there is so much to see and read about. It was a most stimulating visit.
,,Beautiful but frightening if afraid of heights,5.0,,After the indoor gardens we went into the forest and were pleasantly surprised the further we went with statues and plants. However if you are afraid of heights I would not suggest you go up to the higher levels as I could not come down other than by the tree top walk which I found quite scary nd my legs were shaking so I could not really enjoy.
,,Time it right,4.0,,"Lovely bit of architecture and horticulture. Worth of visit. Timing is everything - best when the cloud ‘feature’ is turned on (I think every two hours) or at night.

If you have kids under 12 be sure to visit the children’s garden with it’s fantastic splash park."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Pretty amazing stuff here. The forest is just spectacular and if you're not careful you might even learn something while you're there.
,,The waterfall is mind blowing!,5.0,,Must watch on your visit to Gardens by the bay! Plan it before the light and sound show to avoid rush and also closing timing.
,,Cannot be more enthusiast!,5.0,,uohhh!!!! something very original and cool to visit! felt again like a kid in a wonder kingdom. the different botanical environmental are so incredibly real and pleasant!
,,atractive,5.0,,"nice cloudy place ,with different flower you have to go up by elevator and then come down walking just amazing"
,,Cool Place to Visit,4.0,,"I don't really wow at this place but it certainly has some charm at the entrance where a full height waterfall creates the ambience. The route inside is quite well planned that you would go through the entire cloud forest.

Recommend to visit the cloud forest in the early evening so when you are out of the place, enjoy also the night scene and bedazzle by the Garden Rhapsody of the Supertrees at the Gardens by the Bay!"
,,"FANTASTIC,,, STUPENDOUS,,, SPECTACULAR",4.0,,"It is really unbelievable,,, so, big,,, thunderous and wonderful,,, the atmosphere inside makes to quench the heat within no time. The waterfall is too good and it chills the spine with drooling ice cold water,,,

Just, go, have fun and stay long to enjoy the ice cold atmosphere inside to quench the heat of Singapore,,,"
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"As soon as you walk into the dome your are met by the full height waterfall ... and you get that instant ""wow"" factor. When taking the lift to the top of the dome you then commence your gentle walk back down, with plenty of photo opportunities for views & plant life. During our visit we experienced the 'misting' of the dome, which creates another great visual effect. I would thoroughly recommend a visit to this wonderful place"
,,Big waterfalls and really cold at nite,4.0,,"This is a part of Garden By The Bay. Better come in 3.00 PM, for a better and clear scenery.
In a green forest there's a waterfall at front, will welcome us after the entrance. Some of the mist of water will make us wet.
In the middle of plants, we can see some special craft which is made for this garden.
Many trees, flowers and also a hidden secret garden in here.
If u like to see more various of plants just visit this dome."
,,Impressive piece of engineering,4.0,,"The 'botanical' aspect of the dome did not impress me much. However, the architectural and engineering aspects were brilliant.
Despite being smaller than the Flower Dome, I personally preferred the Cloud Forest Dome, but both are worth visiting if you are spending some time in Singapore."
,,Must see,5.0,,The cloud forest is well worth the entrance fee. It is a spectacular tourist attraction within the gardens by the bay. We really enjoyed walking down through the cloud forest.
,,Wow... just Wow...,5.0,,This was a wonderful surprise to me (I had not idea what I was going into...) I had done the flower dome and wandered over - the waterfall had me memorized. It is a wonderful facility with incredible artwork and vegetation. The stalactites were a feast for the eyes as well.
,,Great Way to Beat the Heat,5.0,,This was truly amazing. Great views from all around and the air is nice and cold. It as fun to weave in and out of the waterfall looking at the different flowers and plants.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We visited the Super Trees almost 3 months ago and today on our way home, we visited the Cloud Forest. I absolutely loved it. It is stunning. It is also a welcome relief from hot steamy Singapore so it is just a joy to walk around We spent almost two hours just wandering around with our mouths open. The only thing I didn't get is all the stalagmites-they just didn't fit in my opinion. We visited the Flower Dome after this and if I was pressed for time, I would definitely go here and give the Flower Dome a miss."
,,Absolute delight,5.0,,"Absolute delight for your senses, should not miss. The view from top is amazing and so is the cloud walk. Must see"
,,Cloud Forest is heaven on earth.,5.0,,"I went to Flower Dome & Cloud Forest,,,, Both of them give me new experience & feeling. But when I went to CF, my mind is so peaceful & happy. It is a real cloud forest & heaven on earth. Really love that place."
,,Wonderfully Cool!,5.0,,"Worth the charge as it's so beautiful and cool inside, you can climb around or just wander. Beautifully maintained flora and very informative in the English language. Would recommend to all ages."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Preferred the Cloud Forest to the Flower Dome. The waterfall and range of plants is amazing reminded me of New Zealand.
,,The perfect place for nature lovers,5.0,,"Nature lovers must visit this place. It is full of different plants inside. For me, the star of this place was the tall man-made falls located at the entrance. We got wet while walking on the side of it. Also the trail to see the whole area was magnificent. Just a warning for those who are afraid of heights, you need to follow the trail to reach the top of the falls."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The best part of the domes. A must see. Far far better than the flower dome if you havr limited time. Also better than the sky walk which is the next best thing to do here.
,,Name says it all,5.0,,"Just love the feeling right from start itself, where u love to get clicked in the fountain that is coming down. Then you climb all the way up to get the real feeling of walking in the cloud.

Advised to charge your phone to click you selfie against the lovely backdrop.

Visit during 5 to 6 PM so that you could get best of both day an night time"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"One of the two massive glass houses at this attraction, a definite must do in Singapore.Take your time and take it all in, there is plenty to see"
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Forest in the city, made make forest, must visit if you can't visit a true tropical forest. Plus the orchids, and many jungle floral and plants."
,,Not for every tourist,3.0,,"This is located inside the Gardens by the bay and is strictly for those who understand and appreciate trees and plantations. Else, it may be worth missing it.

We enjoyed the architecture but you wont miss much if you decide to miss it.

There is an artificial waterfall at the entrance and then there are many trees/ plantations etc that possibly are not well understood by a common tourist.

We were a common tourist so just enjoyed clicking pictures without necessarily understanding the essence of it.

So if you are at Gardens by the bay and have lots of time OR if you are tree/ plantations enthusiast then you could visit it else you could consider avoiding it as its not for a normal tourist"
,,Disappointing & expensive experience,2.0,,"I was hugely disappointed walking through this dome. We queued for about half an hour before we could go up in the lift so no one was really paying attention to their surroundings.

When we finally got to the top, there were no explanations about any of the trees/plants. People were just taking selfies, there was no sense of the appreciation of nature... it was a really disappointing experience and really not worth the money, especially the higher price you pay as a tourist.

I came out of this dome not knowing a single thing about any of the trees that live in there. There were also quite a few plastic flowers which gave it a slightly tacky feeling.

I would not recommend this nor would I ever return."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This place is a must see the architect who designed this place has a fantastic mind and imagination the thought and workmanship that has gone into this place is incredible very highly recommended
,,Simply breathtaking,5.0,,"If you're buying a dual pass, definitely see the flower dome first because nothing quite lives up to the cloud forest once you've seen it - it is stunning. Also recommend arriving on the even-hour (ie. 2pm, 4pm, 6pm..) when the misting commences. You'll feel as though you're truly in another world."
,,Not the best...,3.0,,"Yes it's big. Yes it's amazing and surprising, but you must consider this just as something created to amaze you. It's going to succeed....However if you want to see plants and flowers go to the Botanic Gardens. The Cloud Forest is visitable in 1 hour and a half, there you will find exotic plants and people. The only remark is the temperature...too cold due to the air conditioning."
,,Will Be Back!,5.0,,The Cloud Forest replicates the environment you find in tropical mountain regions and the first thing that greets your eyes upon entering is a 115 feet waterfall. The whole place is inspiring and relaxing I wish I had more time to explore and I know I will be back next trip!
,,Must visit,5.0,,Went here with my partner and we loved it. Loved that there was an exhibit touching on global warming and the plants and waterfall were incredible. Signs were informative too. It cost us about $16 SG each but it was definitely worth it.
,,A short weekend trip to Singapore,5.0,,"This is a lovely place to go and have a haven for photographers! The cool misty air was refreshing and gave a contrast to the sweltering climate outside. Certainly a place to chill! LOL.

The waterfall, a myriad of orchids, mountain plants and various other kinds of plants were a joy to see. The upper levels gave a lovely view of the world outside of the dome itself.

For quite a fee, the Cloud Forest wasn't a disappointment. Worth every penny!"
,,This is one place in Singapore that I visit oftent,5.0,,"I can't get enough of this place. One one spend days in the Gardens by the bay, and I visit often. This is a must visit."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Stunning display of plants. air conditioned. Beautiful waterfall. Just spectacular. Walkways easy to navigate
,,Incredible and Stunning,5.0,,Go to this air-conditioned dome and be truly amazed. At the entrance you confront a huge waterfall about 6 stories high and then take a lift to the top of the structure and explore each level. Work your way down to the bottom via escalators. An absolute must-see.
,,Cool waterfall,4.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest after we'd been to the Flower Dome and for me it wasn't as good but have to say the waterfall & the walkway through the 'clouds' was worth seeing although i'm not sure they were clouds, more of a misting!!!
If you walk further down the walkway as the misting starts you do get a better view looking upwards at the 'clouds'. The misting takes place every couple of hours so try & visit at those times.
Take your time as you walk through the Cloud forest as it's a one way walk & you may miss some interesting things.
After you finish the walkway there's a gallery that you can & should take time to watch regarding the effects the human race has/ is having on this planet."
,,My favorite,5.0,,There is tropical forest and artificially cloud is created by generating mist. Best part is the walkway at different levels with the mist getting generated - actually feels like walking in the cloud.
,,You'll enjoy it definitely!,5.0,,Great feeling when The cool breeze from the waterfall touches your face when you step inside. What a cool experience in the hot weather of singapore. Remember some people may need a light jacket as it gets a bit cold inside.
,,Weekend family outing,4.0,,"Interesting, amazing and fun. Food and beverages nearby. Cloud forest and skywalk were interesting. Casual or sports dressing is recommended. Do not use high heels or tight-fitting shoes."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Fun, educational and visually captivating. We went not knowing all there is too see in this part of Singapore but were very happy to find multiple attractions."
,,"Waterfall is cool, but the rest is a bit of a gimmick unless you're into plants",3.0,,"Time your visit to be there for the misting - not hugely exciting, but may as well get all you can for your money. It's about half hour to an hour visit if you don't really care about the plants and wanted to see the 'clouds' and the waterfall."
,,Prepare to get wet,5.0,,The waterfall is as you go through the entrance ro the cloud dome. The way it has been created inside the dome is novel indeed and unless you skirt round the far edge you will encounter some refreshing spray after the heat from outdoors.
,,Impressive,5.0,,"I'm amazed of what the men is capable to do. Is quite sad to experience the Cloud Forest in a ""Museum"" than the real life. But nowadays, we live in a big cities and the reality is that we are finishing with nature. This place is like a ""Zoo"" for plants.
Still quite amazing."
,,Cool Site!,4.0,,"Been here twice in 2016, it was cool at first but on my next visit it started to get a bit boring but i still enjoy the waterfall and cloud walk. It is indeed amazing!"
,,Majestic,5.0,,It was a dream come true for me because I only see this on pictures but thank God I have experience going here at an early age. It is very cold inside the dome so wear something with long sleeves.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"surprisingly created jungle effect, with waterfalls and air bridges. So much beauty in one place. Place worth a visit"
,,Vary good place,5.0,,this is part of garden by the bay. Its vary good an unique place. When we visit there then we realist we can come in different world.
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Very impressive how this garden has been created. The entrance with the waterfall and flower/plant wall is beautiful. Start at the top with the elevator and work your way down from here. Well worth the entrance fee. Information is a bit low-profile, nothing new to learn from them, but good anyway (provided an insight on why this attraction was created)."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,Superb experience of walking on clouds! Worth the price of the ticket. There is a superb waterfall in the middle that we can walk around.
,,Did both Domes and we prefered the Cloud Dome,5.0,,"We did the Cloud Dome first as a family. The first thing you notice as you walk in the door is how much colder it is. You walk straight in to the bottom of the waterfall. Great photo Op. If you time it right you will be there for a 'misting'. Fine spray comes out and makes it look very tropical. You walk around and then eventually you catch a lift up and slowly walk adown along the walk ways. Great views and plant life from all levels. Its well worth it and if you only get to do one dome, so this one. We also did the Flowers dome, but way prefer the Cloud."
,,Do not miss this place,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a must visit if you are in Singapore, its magnificent and beautiful.

Tip: Do spend more time downstairs when you enter admiring the water showers, once you enter and go up the forest, you will exit out directly (however there is a provision for re-entry, but its mostly exhausting, once you come out)"
,,Great,5.0,,Beautiful scenery inside this mini forest with a various kind of plants. Clean and comfortable place to visit.
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,What a beautiful place. Loved by adults and children lots of things to do as well as the Cloud Forest. We spent a day here and still didn't see everything
,,Amazing Forest in the middle of a City,5.0,,Nice man made water falls and lots of orchids and plants so beautifully arranged. In every floor you can see different kind of plants.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Me and my husband went to the cloud forest while we were in Singapore and it was lovely to see how much a city still cares about the nature. The whole are surrounding this is lovely and peaceful, we went at night time to be able to see all of the lights. It's amazing to see the waterfall inside this dome and to see all this different types of flowers. It is worth a visit but we didn't need too long here, it depends if you are the type of person who reads all the of the signs."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,It’s absolutely stunning to see when you first walk in. I have never seen a cloud forest so I was in awe. Walking up and around from above was very cool and very educational. The flowers were gorgeous.
,,Cool indoor garden,4.0,,"Really interesting to visit an indoor garden and dome on this immense scale. The walk takes you to the top of the mountain where you stand at the top of the waterfall. There are many beautiful plants and flowers to see. Lots of photo opportunities. It is very air conditioned, bring a jacket if you get cold easily! You can get a stamp as you leave for re entry. This is my preferred dome, but I would just visit the outdoor gardens in the future."
,,Love this place,5.0,,"No visit to Singapore would be complete without a visit to the Cloud Forrest. Took my Mother this time, who isnt very mobile but by using the lifts and walkways we were able to view all the Cloud Forrest has to offer. Wasn't even as slippery as I thought it might be"
,,Disneyland forest,3.0,,We needed a break from the heat...so we went in. That's what it was...a break from the heat. Go to the Botanic Garden instead for a better rainforest experience.
,,nice and cool rainforest,4.0,,huge waterfall surrounded by rainforest. You go up quite a few levels by lift or escalator to view the different plants at each level of a cloud forest. It can even get a bit chilly especially if you get wet from the spray of the waterfall. Very pretty and great views outside too of the Singapore River and surrounds like Marina Bay Sands.
,,Nice,4.0,,I think this is 1 of the largest indoor waterfalls and beautiful mist as you enter inside the cloud forest. It gets really cold though so do carry a jacket when u go in... Really enjoyed our visit.
,,Just brilliant,5.0,,"This was a peaceful, interesting and fascinating stroll through a huge dome. The walk starts at the top via a lift, the walk then winds its way down, plenty of photo opportunities. Before exiting there is a gallery with a reminder of what the human race has done to our earth - everyone should see that."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This sure is an awesome place to visit especially if you like plants and flowers. Amazing display in an forest feel, complete with waterfall and mist all in a huge glass dome. Take a lift to the top and walk slowly down.
Best to come before sunset especially to catch the setting sun against the Marina Bay Sands triple tower structure.
You will get the best of daylight and night view..."
,,Marvel at Human engineering,5.0,,"Imaging creating a Human forest , a specialised collection of evergreen and cultivating them .. Then add a giant waterfall front at the entrance . Spectacular ! Now Marvel ..

-Do remember to visit the other attractions around the area while you are here .

My recommended itinerary :
2pm - Go for the cloud forest and flower dome first , to avoid the hot sun . Have a good lunch before heading over .
4pm - Tour Gardens by the Bay (Gbtb)
5.30pm - Dinner at Satay by the Bay
6pm - Tour Marina Barrage
6.45pm - Enjoy the sunset view of the Marina Bay Area from Gardens by the Bay East .

*Additional things to do , grab an OBike and cycle up to Lau Pa Sat for a second round of supper or up Singapore river to club and drink the night away ."
,,A bit overrated,2.0,,"The whole area is smaller than expected, tickets are expensive, lacks variety. Only the artificial fountain is a catch but not as promoted. Find better stuffs to do if you can."
,,WOW,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens and waterfalls. Loved the walk to top, An absolute delight and credit goes to the people who look after the garden, just spectacular. Loved the wood carvings, crystal level and the amazing view downwards from the top."
,,Cooling off on a humid Singapore afternoon,5.0,,"what an inspiring place! it was all the brochures said plus more.

we arrived from a typicallyt hot and humid afternoon in Singapore and were immediately over awed by the splendor that met our eyes. It was a cool 20 degrees, the largest indoor waterfall was flowing from top to bottom and the whole place was alive with rainforrest trees and shrubs and lots of locally carved wooden sculptures. Oh if only we had allowed enough time to fully enjoy this splendor. we will be back to Singapore, just alone to see more of the cloud Forrest and the other domes in the park. just beautiful. go there. Oh and the toilets!!! OMG they have a little river running through with rocks and fish, go there even if its only to look."
,,Behind the waterfall.,5.0,,If you've ever wanted to venture behind a huge waterfall this will not disappoint. A 35 meter tall indoor waterfall and a must filled cloud to walk through. It's part of Gardens in the Bay and is a must visit.
,,A worth visit in Singapore,4.0,,"A must visit,a very unique place to visit when in Singapore.Haven't seen any indoor garden on such a huge scale before and it was a pleasant experience."
,,Tropical forest 7 storey high in a cloud dome,5.0,,"The entrance is either from flower dome or from the ticketing counter. As you enter you are greeted by a superb waterfall and a great view of the bay and Marina bay sands hotel. You can choose either to climb up or take an elevator to the 7th level and climb up to the 8 th level and keep walking down one level at a time. The view is scary and not recommended for people scared of heights. There is 5 ft wide iron bridge in the centre and on either side the bridge has wire mesh overhangs of about 2 ft each. Although it is a hanging bridge there is no feel of swing while walking. But this gives a birds eye view of the entire dome. Each level has a place to rest take pics and a theme. There is an entire floor for stalactites and stalagmites, which are artificial I guess. Then at the basement floor we have a secret garden too. Takes about an hour or two to cover the entire dome with walking down option. The exit is through the ticketing area and through the souvenir shop and you have few restaurants too. The backside has a view of the bay and Marina bay sands hotel, good for a walk and photo shoot."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Totally brilliant! A tropical rainforest inside. Make sure you visit when they create the clouds. There's plenty to see and take in. Plenty of seating to sit down and take it all in. This and the flower dome are a must see attraction in Singapore.
,,Cloud Forest heaven....,5.0,,"Well what can I say, a very beautiful cloud forest set in a temperature controlled dome with the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. We didn't really know what to expect, having walked through real cloud forests in Costa Rica, this is a pretty cool version. The plants are amazing and you get to walk right through the top and then make your way down through the various levels. There is a charge to visit here and the flower dome, but worth the money."
,,Amazing! - great way to show the diversity of plants,5.0,,"A great way to present the diversity of plants in thier own settngs, from cooler temperates at the top, to the tropical ones at the bottom. Even better if you are there in one of the 'clouding' moments - make sure you know where they will mist the plants!"
,,More hype than not,3.0,,Visited with our young children and the indoor waterfall was great but beyond that the rest of it was pretty ordinary if you have been to botanical gardens in any major city before.
,,The Beauty of Nature at its Best,5.0,,This place has to be seen to be truly appreciated. I cannot praise the attraction enough. It is a piece of magic that I doubt exists anywhere else in the world. It's truly beautiful.
,,Wow,5.0,,This dome is well worth a visit. It has a massive waterfall inside with easy access walkways from top to bottom. There are some great picture opportunities inside and out.
,,Absolutely Stunning,5.0,,These gardens are just magnificent and well worth the $8 entree fee. They are beautifully climate controlled and lovely and cool inside. The staff are all very helpful and well informed. A total must see in Singapore.

,,Escape the outside heat in the rainforest,5.0,,"Upon your entry you're presented with the waterfall, a brilliant prelude to the tour within. Visit during misting times to pass through the atmospheric fog which surrounds the immaculately kept gardens. The walk takes you through the artificial mountain (don't worry, the walk is all downhill after a lift takes you to the summit). There are plenty of Insta worthy spots and at times you have to contend with punters stopping to take that ""perfect"" duck face selfie. There is a hall at the bottom with the obligatory, ""Humans are bad, our earth is dying"" videos, but overall, this is a spectacular place to visit.
Tip - With the amount of moisture in the dome, some areas are quite slippery, especially the crystals area where we witnessed a boy go A over T racing to get to his parents. Be careful!"
,,Totally amazing,5.0,,"This is a must see activity. Cost was $14 Singapore dollars per adult entry, but you could also buy bundle tickets to see multiple attractions. Very easy to get to the gardens via the metro and signage easy to navigate. You can walk to the cloud forest from the ticket office or catch the shuttle (unlimited daily rides for $3 per adult). You enter the cloud forest and walk around the bottom floor, then catch a lift to the 6th floor and walk the stairs to the 7th floor (or another lift reserved for elderly or disabled persons). The gardens, plants and sights are stunning. You walk from the top of the canopy down a suspended ramp, working your way back to ground level. It does not rock, and as someone who struggles with heights, I was able to do the walk and it was so worth doing. This attraction is accessible to those with disabilities."
,,This is an amazing place,5.0,,"We were just blown away by this place it was awesome, well worth it for people to visit. the flowers and everything were very cool!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Was beautifully set up and is for all ages. Didnt think it was my type of thing but was very impressed !!
,,Like A Rainforest within an enclosure,5.0,,"The first thing that you'd probably see and notice is the waterfall... from there, take time to enjoy the plants from all over Asia while taking pictures around. There's documentary room where videos are shown to you to show the importance of preservation of our forests."
,,Amazing,5.0,,You a greater by an amazing waterfall when you enter the doors that is brilliant. You then walk around this massive pillar that is covered in some stunning plants. Definitely plan your visit in line with the mist as it was amazing to see the dome filled like a cloud whist inside.
,,wonderfull,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is a part of Garden by the Bay. it is amazing place, near metro (MRT) station. if you are with kids, better to have a pram or use shuttle. it is very very beautiful place with great technology"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Amazing view!!! The waterfall is definitely the highlight and once you walk in the skywalk, it's breathtaking!"
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,"Worth the trip!! Make sure you go for sure! Ask someone to take a photo of you behind the waterfall, it comes out great!"
,,Bring a jacket!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest can be quite cool (to keep the temperature and humidity of the plants) so its highly recommend to bring a jacket with you. Especially there is a waterfall at the entrance where you can be a little bit wet.

Take the elevator to the top and walk across the skywalk so you can see the garden from up above.

I will definitely come and visit the Cloud Forest Dome soon if I return to Singapore again!"
,,Interesting,5.0,,"I love the sculptures and the different types of bromeliad and tiger orchids. Check out the Rafflesia lego flower and pitcher plants. Bring a sweater, it can be cold inside the domes."
,,Excellent - view form up here across bay and river are superb. The vertical gardens are absolutely superb and are great,5.0,,Suitable for all ages - older people may need a hand but there are lifts to the top and for people going down again. Heights are high but views are worth it. Very worthwhile seeing.
,,Wonderful & Breathtaking,5.0,,One of the best things in Singapore. It has a breathtaking view from above. Something not to be missed
,,Very Well Maintained,5.0,,This place is very well maintained. The fall at the entrance is particularly eye catching and you get the feeling of surrounded by nature.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Don't be like us and get here early and allow a couple of hours to truly enjoy this experience. Take it slow to get the most out of it. Definitely get the audio tour also, available in a separate section from your tickets to get into the forest.
Apart from being amazed by how the dome and pathways were constructed, the variety of vegetation incorporated into this feature is unparalleled. My camera was in overdrive, there was so much to see and wonder upon."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Had fun with the kids spotting the wooden carved dragons that are dotted throughout the place. Adults appreciated the stunning array of flowers. It’s cold in there!
,,Singapore vidit,5.0,,Great night out with the family and an amazing spectacle! The viewing in the air conditioned garden hall were unbelievable. The views of marina bay sands was something to see at night
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This place took our breath away, truly stunning gardens. We weren't sure whether to pay the money but very glad we did."
,,Yes this is the place,5.0,,This is the place where you should have LOTS of chilling water and awesome theme based flowers and super cool designs.
,,Sight seeing,5.0,,Great little hidden gem in this bustling busy city. Either a day or night (when all the lights are turned on) place to visit. We did daytime as we were flying home that night. Definitely worth a visit and walk round. Free to walk the gardens but the conservatorys and the sky walk around the giant trees is money as you would expect but not too expensive
,,Simply spectacular,5.0,,"This was my favourite place within Gardens on the Bay (yet I really enjoyed everything there).

The Cloud Forest has an immersive feeling of peace and tranquility, as it showcases the 2.5% of world forests that are classified cloud forests.

A lift takes you to the top, and you make a slow descent down. There are informational signs along the way, but it's the views and sheer beauty and diversity of the plants and flowers that will take your breathe away.

Spend 10 minutes watching the videos at the end of the tour, addressing the various human impacts on the natural environment. It's incredibly well done and moving.

The gift shop is one of the best I've been to. There are a number of really cool, high quality and reasonably priced gifts and nick nacks to be found there.

Prepare to spend about 2 hours in total here to get the full experience."
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,"Amazing place, so interesting. We learned a lot. Perhaps pack a jacket? A little chilly in here! Good exercise though!"
,,Beautiful Experience,5.0,,This basically has lots of plants (& some extinct ones too) and has artificial mist an atmosphere. It feels like a waterfall and is convenient to look around different plant types (including carnivorous plants )
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,Fascinating place to visit. Allow lots of time if you are a plant lover to see all it has to offer in detail.
,,Lost world,5.0,,Lost world 300 meters plus above ground ..cool and refreshing ..walk slow and you'll truly enjoy this man-made attraction.
,,What an experience!!,5.0,,"Well worth the entry fee. Spent over an hour here admiring the plants and getting ""lost"" in the mists of the rainforest. Great experience to climb the walkway and walk above the treetops."
,,A Structural Beauty,5.0,,"It was an amazing experience visiting cloud forest , what a structure , stunning waterfall will surely make u say this thing is wow. Loves the way they shaped cloud forest tour from floor to floor... Worth visit"
,,Take an hour to see this,4.0,,"So much to see and do at Gardens by the Bay. I'd suggest going into the Cloud Forest first. And bring a jacket, because it's chilly high up. Rent the audio explanations. You'll.get much more out of it."
,,Truly beautiful!,5.0,,Stunning and beautiful orchids and many more tropical plants set inside the largest indoor gardens. See the massive waterfall as soon as you enter the awesome domed structure. It's definitely worth a visit.
,,A plus,5.0,,Nice as they seasonally decorate and one is astounded by the plants and flowers. Also nice as it provides an nice cool place to see during the heat of the day!
,,An awesome structure with the most fantastic 'indoor garden'.,5.0,,"This was a most unforgettable experience, and I was blown away with its size and the profusion of tropical plants and flowers. I don't know of any other place like it, and could have stayed there all day admiring the structure as well as the tropical growth. A photographer's paradise. A fantastic asset for Singapore! Well done!"
,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,"Stunning place to visit. Wasn't quite sure what to expect but was fascinated by the large variety of plants, by the mountain and waterfall. Really recommended! Just remember to have a sweater/light jacket with you as it's pretty chill."
,,Mind blowing. Just WOW.,5.0,,"I have never experienced anything like this. It was just amazing, something that you need to visit while in Singapore."
,,VERY ENJOYABLE AND EASY WAY TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS,5.0,,The size of the vertical garden is incredible. Good for those who enjoy gardening and exotic plants.
,,A gardeners delight,5.0,,"Loved everything about it except for the entry price. It is a cool haven on a hot Singapore day.
Quite convenient to get to via MRT. Unfortunately we took two taxis and part of our party were taken on a long detour and arrived half an hour after us and paid over $20 when we only paid $7, so keep an eye on the way the driver takes you. We were about to call hospitals and police as we were sure they must have had an accident."
,,Lost in the Lost World,4.0,,"There is sign with Stairs going to the Lost World, and we are really lost. But any way. it;s amazing experience."
,,nature lover,4.0,,"it's a place for someone who loves nature. a quiet and omg, so cold! where you can relax and make sure to wait until 4pm in the cloud forest. that's when the fog start to come out."
,,Best part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Hughe airconditioned dome. Impressive collection of plants and trees. The skywalk (easy acces with elevators) gives great views on All inclusief the waterfalls
,,Nice,4.0,,Interesting but if you have a handicap or disability be cautious. The ramp that winds down is very nice
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Again just beautiful to see. i would recommend a must see, Was a very humid day when we went but the water spray was lovely with all the lovely ferns and art works made from what looked like drift wood."
,,Lovely to see but it's cold inside!!,4.0,,"It's like entering another world. The minute you step inside the hot humidity of Singapore disappears as it's very chilly inside. My kids were shaking! You do get splashed by the waterfall too so this makes you even colder you walk around at your leisure, looking at the plants and cloudy mist up high before you go up and walk to wards the bottom. It's a beautiful place when you stand back and look st all the amazing trees/plants all tucked away in a huge dome which windy walking bridges to help you navigate your way. I think it's one if those places you're happy to say you e been to and seen but wouldn't rush back in a hurry as entry is expensive for a family of 4."
,,Beautiful and educational - highly recommend,5.0,,"What better way to appreciate nature than in a gorgeous, well-designed and well-maintained space? Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, it's also educational and eco-friendly!
It was so refreshing to escape the humidity and step into an oasis of green. I felt like I was in a Jurassic Park movie!!!"
,,wonderful attraction,5.0,,"a wonderful experience to know more about nature , a huge artificial waterfall with details of how plants flowers and greenery can create a wonderful place so exciting and pleasing to the eye"
,,Awesome,5.0,,I can't recommend this enough. If you have to limit your stops while in Singapore make sure this makes the cut. It's also a nice break from the heat. Amazing.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,An amazing experience. So much diversity. Beautiful setup and would highly recommend to anyone of all ages!
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"Breathtaking! we really love the experience. it,s a must! The ticket costs 16 sgp dollars pers person ."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is so well done and well worth a visit A lot to see and very informative Though a head for heights helps A great way to spend a morning or afternoon
,,Amazing indoor garden and waterfall,5.0,,"If you do one thing in the Gardens by the Bay do this. You are greeted with an amazing indoor waterfall and a huge drop in temperature from outdoors. The Cloud forest is a unique thing to see and a great walk through some fantastic gardens. Check out all the pictures people post and you can see how much they enjoy it. I spent a few hours here and in the other gardens and thought this was the best by far. a lot to see so don't rush through, especially if you like plants and nature. The misty air as you walk through is quite a sight and has a great calming feel to it. Worth the price of admission."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,I was absolutely blown away by the cloud forest. I went in with no expectations and loved every minute of it. The only downside for me is that I didn't schedule in enough time to just sit and enjoy it. I will go again. Worth the money
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,Would definitely recommend visiting. We also went into the Flower Enclosure and although this is good it suffers by comparison.
,,worth the visit despite the crowds,5.0,,take your time and best towards end of day and make sure you have plenty of time once over that side of Singapore
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A wonderful place with lots of plants, artfully placed and well maintained. A must see for all who visit Singapore."
,,"Got lost in the clouds, and we loved it!",5.0,,"This place is amazing. Once you are inside it you lose sense of where you are completely.

You start from the top and work your way down which seems a disorienting path through the clouds.

With a different sight around every corner this is definitely a must do in Singapore!"
,,Good if you're with young kids,3.0,,"Cloud forest is one of the main attractions at Gardens by the Bay. Even though its not much a marvel when you get done with it, its great at first sight. Kids will enjoy."
,,My favorite,5.0,,"This was hands down my favorite attraction at gardens by the bay. The flowers and the wall were beautiful, the sky wall was very lovely. Wet surface aircoolers for the win!!"
,,"A cool, green haven on a hot, sticky day",5.0,,"One of the major attractions at gardens by the bay and one that you gave to pay to go into. It's a huge glass structure with a controlled environment that mimics the temperature and humidity if a cloud forest. Hence it is cool. There's a large indoor waterfall that is close to the entrance and you basically follow a path that leads you round and round up to the upper part of the dome and then back down again. Lots of interesting plants, sculptures and exhibits. Wonderful views out across the river or towards the Singapore skyline. A great use of an hour or so of your time"
,,Captivating Experience high up in the Cloud Forest,5.0,,The waterfall is amazing! You will immediately feel cool as you walk around in this mist covered environment even if it's 38 degrees centigrade outside. No visit to Singapore is complete without at least one visit to Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest. The plants are amazing too!
,,Wow Amazing,5.0,,This is one of the most beautiful gardens that i have had the pleasure in visiting. Make sure you you give yourself plenty of time as there are a view other wonderful sites to see while at the Gardens by the Bay. Spectacular will come again next time i am in Singapore
,,Wow,5.0,,"My Husband and I thought the Cloud Forrest was one of the highlights of our Singapore trip, the waterfall and all the different trees, plants and sculptures were amazing to look at, every time we turned around there was some thing different to look at.
Well worth the money to enter. Highly recommended."
,,Beautiful man-made garden,4.0,,"It is nicely air-conditioned mostly indoor well manicured garden. No insects, nothing natural about it. It is gorgeous to walk through the misty path of greeneries. Perfect for a hot humid day but as for a rainy day, it can feel cold."
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,Really brilliant with a waterfall as you go in and super views all the way around. It was a really good experience and would highly recommend a visit here if you are in Singapore
,,Out of the world,5.0,,"This attraction is located within the Gardens by the Bay and you have to pay separately to enter. lt is worth every cent and you spend hours here. There is an artificail mist that is created by spraying jets of water into the enclosed atmosphere. There is a nice tall waterfall that you can walk behind. Within this atrraction there is the Cloud walk that gives you a totally different view of the Singapore skyline from a vantage view, a crystal mountain, a Treetop walk and a Cavern and you can take time to admire the 60000 plants from the tropical highlands. It is very cooling here.

Must go for"
,,Love the Forest.. hate the crowds,3.0,,"Do try to avoid weekends or holidays.. thats when the locals come out to play ... Love the greenery on all levels, especially the minerals collection.."
,,"Definitely a must-see, world-class attraction",5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I was initially skeptical of the ticket price to enter the Cloud Forest. As soon as I stepped inside, though, my impression was changed completely. The Cloud Forest is a really interesting concept and hosts a wide variety of interesting and beautiful plants that you don't usually see in our climate. The structural build of the entire place is amazing. It doesn't take long to cover the entire area, you can probably complete it in less than 2 hours, but the cool weather in the Cloud Forest may just make you want to stay longer than you need to, that is, if you're not busy marveling at the interesting collection of plants here. It's a great place for anyone to visit, kids or folks."
,,The Amazon in Singapore,5.0,,"The domes were the main reason we decided to visit Singapore again after a 40 year break and we were not disappointed. The pavilions were superb and worth the entry fee alone. Don't rush and take time to savor the experience. If the cloud forest looks busy, go onto the flower dome first and return after viewing. Allow 1 1/2 - 2 hours in each"
,,Natural and Elegant,5.0,,We weren't sure what to expect from this attraction - we were pleasantly surprised. The indoor waterfall was awesome. We loved all of the plants and greenery. Cloud Forest is pram friendly and we had no issues getting around. Another huge plus was that this attraction has a cold environment; it was a welcomed break from the very hot weather outside!
,,10 stars,5.0,,"The plants and flowers here are grown in perfect conditions resulting in absolutely perfect flowers. Take your time to look carefully at everything, don't go around mindlessly taking selfies like so many others did. Look for the wood carvings as well, they are interesting. It's also cool in there, a nice break from the heat."
,,Amazing,5.0,,One of my top favorite spots in Singapore. So beautiful and amazing to look at. Waterfalls can get you wet if you stand to close. It's an absolute wonder!!
,,misty,4.0,,"creating the atmosphere of being on a hill station by having mist around all the ferns shrubs, plants and flowers."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Definetly worth the entrance ticket. Singapore's skyline makes it feel like an alien planet. The sky walkway is a must and is amazing. Best enjoyed during sunset hour.
,,Stunning rainforest,5.0,,Fantastic waterfall in a rain forest setting. A series of walkways run around the inside of the waterfall with several viewing platforms. There are lifts available to the various levels for those with mobility issues.
,,Visit to the Gardens,5.0,,"My previous review on Gardens by the Bay mentioned the domes in which 'Cloud Forest' is housed but no details.
This attraction was one of its own. Upon entry you come across a waterfall tumbling down approximately 5 stories in height. With rocks and plants and 'clouds' everywhere. The clouds are formed by the air conditioning, heat and mist sprays everywhere. As you follow the path you come across an entry to a lift which will take you up two the top of the waterfall where you can slowly walk down the walkways to the bottom whilst viewing all the plants etc. Excellent value for money."
,,"Interesting, but expensive",3.0,,"If you're hot this is great as it's a massive, air-conditioned indoor dome with interesting flora, but if you're not (and the flower dome is not open), I recommend skipping it and looking around the free gardens"
,,🙌🏻🙌🏻,5.0,,"Speechless. Everything here is so cool. Yup! I mean cool. Air was incredibly refreshing. So peaceful but for those who are afraid of heights, u might find it abit scary. Else, everything is just pure awesomeness!"
,,unusual experience,4.0,,a strange walk in the cloud. very nice natiral ambient . it is beatiful walk under the waterfall watching marina bau sands. it is a little bit expensive ( it is better if you have the combo ticket with flower dome ) and it is really too cold quite for sure yoi have the flue when you are out
,,Spectacular,5.0,,A gorgeous afternoon spent strolling around this amazing indoor garden. So many beautiful flowers and interesting foliage and artwork. Not to be missed
,,A Must Do,5.0,,From start to finish an outstanding experience. The centrepiece waterfall is impressive as is the walk back down. A must.
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay are a must do in Singapore. The super grove is amazing, the grounds are beautiful and the two domes house a vast array of plants."
,,Husbands bucket list,4.0,,Easy to get around it is an amazing space make sure you go up and do the walk through the clouds Able to access most parts with rams or wheelchairs lifts and elevators available
,,Spectacular! A must do in Singapore,5.0,,This is an amazing exhibit of plants from the Cloud Forests of the world. An elevator takes you up to the highest levels and you work your way down. Wheelchair and stroller accessible. Simply amazing gardens.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This is the best of the two domes, and when you enter you are greeted by a giant waterfall with a lot of greenery. You can go inside the mountain and climb to the top which also offers stunning views. The dome is nice and cool and try to be there for the 'misting' which is simply beautiful."
,,Must See,5.0,,"This place was amazing, it well worth the money. Lovely on a humid day as well as it is very cool inside."
,,What an amazing experience!!!!,5.0,,This experience was wonderful!!!! The man made rainforest with so many plant species was an amazing wonderland. I loved every minute I was there.
,,Incredible Place,5.0,,The design is stunning. A fascinating look at our climate and what is happening to it. Visually it is amazing.
,,"Stand back, take a breath, this will amaze you.",5.0,,Not expecting too much but was stunned with the display of rainforest species. The statues too were breath taking. Watch out for the selfie sticks. They can harm you. One of the best experiences of a lifetime.
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Buy your tickets on line to beat the queues. No need to print. They can scan the barcode on your phone.
So much to see and do. You would be hardpressed not to enjoy it.
An amazing selection of orchids, plants, flowers, the walkway offers stunning views all around and each level offers something else to enjoy!
Don't miss this attraction - you'll kick yourself if you do!"
,,CLOUD FOREST NOT TO MISS,5.0,,Cloud forest is not to be missed. Climb up to the top for excellent view and experience beauty which cant be expressed in words
,,Simply Amazing,5.0,,"It is an indoor paradise. When you enter, you'd see the water falls that looks so real. The entire place was covered with plants. It's worthy of the price."
,,Really interesting,5.0,,"Never been to this before, always meant to and have been well rewarded. It is a spectacular feature and makes you marvel at the efforts and skills that went into making it."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"We were a little rushed for time, as we spent too long in the flower dome, but regardless, definitely worth a visit if you're in the area! Lots to see and many photos to take!"
,,Must do,5.0,,"If you go to Gardens by the Bay DO go into the Cloud Forest, its the better of the two domes with manufactured clouds. So awesome."
,,Take your time.,5.0,,"Take your time to walk around the cloud forest and be sure to use the bridge - giving you the ultimate view of forest. Do visit their secret garden on your way out. Be careful of your belongings (when you use a selfie stick or while taking a selfie while on the bridge, it's a long way down)."
,,Loved the visit but not the crowds,4.0,,"A great place to visit. It sits in 'The Gardens by the Bay' alongside the Supertrees, worth visiting joust to see those. The plants, flowers and art work inside the Cloud dome are marvellous and quite beautiful. It's also cooled in the dome, a real relief after the heat and humidity of Singapore. The downside is the crowd of people if your timing is wrong. It was very busy when I visited and that spoiled it a little and hence the 4 star instead of 5."
,,Understandably Top Ten,5.0,,"The advertising says Gardens By The Bay are one of the Top 10 gardens in the world. I've visited several of the world's best garden shows including the Keukenhoff in Holland and wasn't moved by the claim. So 5 years after the Cloud Forest opened, I visited it. I'm not going to spoil it for you by describing the Cloud Forest ... but I decided to buy an annual pass (Friend of the Gardens) and I've been back every weekend this month, combining my visit with my 7.30am walk/jog around Marina Bay. Tip: Go at 9 am to beat the weekend crowds."
,,Man Made Beauty,4.0,,The cloud forest essentially is a green house with a vegetation that you find at high altitudes. During certain times of the day they create a mist there which is nice to see. They also have a water fall. Its good to take a visit here but its not something that will take your breath away.
,,Good place to make you cool,3.0,,Its located in the gardens by the bay. Just infront of flower doom. A artificial fountain there. You need to go here before entering flower doom. Coz flower doom is much better place.
,,Doome of magic,4.0,,"From the moment you step inside you will have all your senses come alive, from the waterfall to the elevated walk ways."
,,Don't miss this fabulous exhibit,5.0,,"This garden several stories high is amazing and fabulous. We did the Flower Dome first and then this Dome - both domes are on your ticket when you buy it.

We got the lift to the top and then made our way down. There were people who seem to be on tours but we just made our way around ourselves. The atmosphere was great and all the plants were beautiful. We took louds of photos.

Highly recommend this - don't miss this and make sure you do the other dome first as this one is way better than the other one."
,,A place anyone should definitely should visit!,4.0,,My son and I both thoroughly enjoyed visiting the cloud forest as it allowed us to know about the wildlife in rainforests. This man-made forest also has a spectacular cloud walk where you can walk around the waterfalls and above everyone else! My son was so scared that he kept on holding onto the railing and shuffled along!
,,Wobbly bridges!,3.0,,"This does have a certain wow factor to it. I liked how it generated its own energy, but whilst looking at it intently, it reminded me of a concrete car park covered in plants. It is quite pricey to get in, and the plants in it reminded me of the ones you get in England."
,,"Worth a look, but wouldn't go back in a hurry.",3.0,,"The waterfall is easily the most impressive part in cloud forest, and it all looks pretty cool when the most starts! If you're particularly interested in nature - plants I particular then this is the place to go! Personally I wasn't overly impressed, but it was a good way to cool down!"
,,Normal,2.0,,"Personally not impressed at all , very normal place with high unjustified propaganda , but the organization and service quality is very good."
,,amazing,5.0,,"An extraordinary engineering achievement, cascading waterfalls combined with stunning sculpture an easy walk to the top dont miss it."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"This dome, located within the Gardens by the Bay, is incredible. A must-see. It houses a beautiful variety of plants and flowers and a stunning indoor waterfall. It is a bit cold because of the mist so you will want to bring a light jacket or sweater. Also note that misting occurs only at set times so please check the schedule before going. Typically lineup to get in isn't long and though there are a lot of people inside, it doesn't feel that crowded.

Take your time to appreciate everything in here and don't speed to get to the clouded walkway - there are incredible and spooky sculptures hidden everywhere."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Must visit. Great place to be on a hot day. The bridge walk gives you great views of Marina Bay, and the plants and water falls are very relaxing. It""s like being in a big dense forest, like the ones in NZ."
,,More interesting,5.0,,This is next to the gardens by the bay. Again it's no more than a huge greenhouse in Singapore. A little more interesting with the waterfalls and ponds but still only worth the money once to have a look around and enjoy
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Place is excellent, good for all age groups. Little over crowded than usual places in Singapore, so be prepared to spend some time if you want personalised photos !! A must do."
,,well worth the look....,4.0,,"What a amazing set up well done Singapore..It is for all ages, for the old and those who have a walking problem, it has a elevator that goes to every level, the views, the fauna, and the well set out walk ways and viewing platforms are well placed for a great time..."
,,Amazing Visit,5.0,,Do not miss this if in Singapore. Very impressive. A respite in the heat of Singapore and suitable for any age group even if it doea not seem so when entering. An architectural wonder and very educational as well.
,,Lovely,5.0,,The cloud forest is soooo amazing you walk in and your greeted by a huge man made water fall you get to walk around he whole some high and low.
,,must visit,5.0,,as it's part of the gardens by the bay along with the flower dome you can tickets for both at a reduced rate
,,Definite must-experience when in Singapore,5.0,,"A truly breathtaking garden, a must-see, artificial forest in the clouds, with waterfalls and bi-hourly mist release... Magical, and quite cooling, too... Go see it, very much recommended!!!

For everybody, not only nature lovers... and pay a little attention to the final exhibit about the ongoing sixth mass extinction event... Maybe a little preachy, but true, with far-reaching consequences for not all but many, esp. younger, people who are alive today."
,,A man made forest.,4.0,,This man made rainforest is certainly unique. It supplements the sights at Gardens on the Bay nicely and if you have the time it's worth having a look at the giant waterfall and looking at some of the interesting rainforest plants. The cool environment is a plus as well.
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,We enjoyed a wonderful visit to the Could Forest. Beautifully presented with enough to see over an hour or so. Also a great respite from the heat and humidity for awhile.
,,Big artificial water fall in Singapore,5.0,,"Eventhough this is the man-made falls, it helps us to cool down the hot climate of Singapore. The modern work is covered with a thousand kinds of flora making me to be lost in the forest."
,,Visit to Cloud Forest,5.0,,I had visited this place twice with my family. We all love this place very much. I am astonished by the way this design has been done. It is maintained very well. It is a must see place in Singapore.
,,Walking among the cool in the city,5.0,,Went for a Walk on a hot afternoon in the Cloud Forest. The cool air brings back memories of days spent on mountaintops. The landscape successfully depicted what flora on mountains are like. Makes a good educational site to bring children to. Ideal place to spend a hot afternoon.
,,worth to visit,4.0,,"My favorite sightseeing at Sands park area. To be honest, you can skip others except this one. Nice to walk around."
,,Not bad...,4.0,,"A man-made forest with waterfall, lovely flora & fauna and a scenic view of Singapore. If you love flowers, definitely visit this place. Also, it's a good place to escape the heat."
,,Great place as artificial forest,5.0,,Better come on daylight. Go the highest floor and go down. Great view above and they have schedule for mist.
,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,Fantastic example of a manmade Cloud forest (naturals one form only 2% of world forests). The waterfall is a lovely place for a selfie or family picture. Can be visited more than once for the feeling of freshness
,,Cooling,5.0,,Cooling and cozy place in the busy city Refreshing and breathtaking place sutiable for families and friends
,,Nice place,5.0,,"I visited dome flowers and cloud forest. I loved flowers dome the building architecture was so awesome like in jurassic park lol, the flowers was so lovely, fresh and smell so good and cloud forest had a great view on top. When I visited they had an event, Star Wars.. I had stay until its getting dark the views in the night more lovely, the lights was so amazing and i was lucky to met Star Wars and take some picture with them."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"The cloud forest was an interesting venue. The waterfall, landscaping and plants were displayed with great effect."
,,Breathtaking!!,5.0,,Experience being in a cloud and making your way down to ground level with the world's largest manmade waterfall by your side. Not to be missed.
,,Cloud Forest is part of gardens by the bay,5.0,,This was one of the nicest places we visited in our trip. Fantastic to see the waterfalls and the misters which create cloud-like mist. This is part of gardens by the bay and one of the two domes to visit. As a hint we joined the friends of the gardens which was cheaper than paying for separate entry to the two domes and the suspension walkway. They had a special at the time.
,,Gosh High Walks,5.0,,"Beautiful, you'd expect it to be much hotter, but actually it is rather refreshing, with tall waterfalls, lifts and escalators, walk ways suspended in the air - not for everyone, but we loved it!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"You will never see this somewhere else,like it very much,very high and beautiful!Enter is not free,but be sure,is worth it!)"
,,Excellent!,5.0,,Must do attraction and cool in the heat of the day. A little expensive around $16 but once you are inside you forget what you spent. Would definitely recommended and will visit again!
,,A walk in the mountain top,5.0,,"The amazing view of the waterfall at the main entrance stunned me. The temperature inside the cloud forest is cooling and it makes the visit more comfortable in a hot weather. I was amazed by the variety of plants and flowers on the mountain, especially the orchid. Me and my friend went up to the top floor by the lift and take a stroll down surrounding the mountain. There are a lot of surprises along the way like secret garden, crystal mountain, the lost world and tree top walk. I enjoy the visit very much."
,,Brilliant concept and surprising execution,5.0,,Indoor water garden with amazing wooden sculptures you could easily (and sadly) miss. Beautiful flowers and fauna and high walks. Go.
,,Awesome to explore,5.0,,Really impressive place to see. The construction and plant life is amazing. It is also got some temperature control in the dome so a nice break from the hot Singapore humidity! Cost us $28 per adult to go to this and the Flower dome. Which we found worth it.We spent about 60 minutes in this dome alone.
,,"Nice gardens, but crowded",3.0,,"The Cloud Forest contains some very pretty plants & flowers and is impressively set out; however, being in a restricted space, the crowds can make it difficult to enjoy the experience - the Botanic Gardens are much more impressive, with room to move and it's free!"
,,Wow,5.0,,It's my first time to enter such conservatory and it was an amazing experience. The entrance fee althought quite expensive is worth it.
,,Paradise,5.0,,A lush tranquil engineering marvel. Words cannot describe the Beaty and ingenuity of this huge conservatory. The waterfall is breathtaking and the walk down from the top is a delight.
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,This place really amazes me. I am awed with the way they made this attraction. This is a must when you visit Singapore especially if you like nature and flowers. Can't believe that you have something like this amongst the towering buildings.
,,Enjoy cloud walk,5.0,,"It is Singapore’s most impressive attraction.This staggering 'greenhouse-like glass dome' is the best maintained
cooled conservatory.

Enter the Cloud Forest, a mysterious world veiled in mist. The man made 'cloud mountain' is 115 feet high which is clad with attractive flowers,lilies,orchids,pitchers,sunflower,ferns and diverse attractive green canopy.Take in breath-taking mountain views surrounded by diverse vegetation and hidden floral gems. learn about rare plants and their fast-disappearing environment.It has tallest indoor waterfall.enjoy the great sights of waterfall and refreshing cool air.
The beautiful landscape with lush vegetation will mesmerize you.
Go to the top in lift and then start climb down along spiral walkways filled with hanging gardens.Enjoy the different levels with distinct themes.enjoy the views from top.
Enjoy the cloud walk feeling the misty air.see nature at its best."
,,Very nice,5.0,,This is a lovely experience. You must visit this to experience. Normally crowded . We recommend to visit.
,,singapore stopover,5.0,,This is an absolute must do when in Singapore . It is absolutely amazing and even when it is busy does not seem crowded . ensure you do the flower dome as well . It doers cost to go in but is not excessive.
,,Really cool experience,5.0,,Loved walking around the cloud forest. It feels a little bit like Avatar on the highest platform when the mist is on. Well done Singapore!
,,Must see!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is impressive. It's a tall dome that regulates alpine temperatures to support mountain-top flora. It's a welcome respite to the equatorial heat, and it boasts an excellent range of plants. Pitchers, orchids, ferns; not any that I expected to see in Singapore!
It seems to be wheelchair accessible, with ramps and elevators. However it's a huge area, as you spiral up through different altitudes to see the plants that grow there. Take your walking shoes and a bottle of water for sure.

All man-made, it's wonderfully curated with sculptures dotted throughout. A brilliant day out in Gardens by the Bay."
,,Wonderfull,5.0,,"Located at the ""gardens by the bay"". A beautiful orchid garden. The idea is simple; not much space so lets do a vertical garden. The result is great; a mountain covered with flowers and a waterfall. The climate is also a bonus, relatively cool inside. Enjoyed it very much."
,,Wheelchair Accessible,5.0,,"A wonderful lovely place which is fully wheelchair accessible, with lifts, with ramps in the sky... go there."
,,A must see place,5.0,,"This is a must do. The flower garden and the cloud forest was a breath of fresh air. Something I've never seen before... So many varieties of flowers, trees, cactus and sculptures... The most fascinating thing was the waterfall and the best experience was to walk in and around it when the steam was released."
,,Forest within the city,5.0,,"Purchased the ticket at klook, around 1699 php for 2 persons, including flower dome.

Very nice here. Nearest MRT station is bayfront, then take the lions bridge from the shoppes, take the escalator near Channel. Then walk thru the bridge crossing marina bay sands lobby. You'll have the best view of the garden's by the bay also. Then follow the sign to Cloud Forest.

The enchanting falls makes the place a little colder. Its amazing. I would definitely come back.

We took the lift to level 6, Lost World, the highest bridge inside then walk thru it, went down to mountain museum then the level 3 bridge, I forgot how they call it.
It pretty high, I have fear on heights but managed to cross the bridge on level 6. Its fun! Must try.

Best time to visit is during afternoon before sunset. No good if you visit at night."
,,Stunning,4.0,,"We only had a short stopover in Singapore but this place is so unbelievably beautiful and is definitely a must while in Singapore.

Each inch has been beautifully put together to create a sense of tranquility and bliss.

The only down side was the large swarm of people who attempted to fit into an small elevator, but overall a great experience!"
,,Variety of plants inside a very cosy air~con environment,4.0,,"Walking distance from the Sand Hotel, this ""forest"" in the ""cloud"" garden keeps a variety of plants in a nicely built environment. You and and your kids would certainly enjoy it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"My family enjoyed walking through the cloud forest, great experienced for my daughter. Stunning indoor waterfalls."
,,Surpise!,4.0,,You would think it's just a giant terrarium but it's more than that. I can't even imagine how they set everything up and maintain the place. But it was all worth it. I can say it was an amazing adventure from top to bottom.
,,Incredible,5.0,,It is amazing how they have been able to reproduce the perfect environment inside this huge dome. A must do visit!
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,So worth it - get the lift to the top and then meander down. Air conditioned and cool. Absolutely stunning.
,,More like an indoor garden view (with artifical water fall) to me,3.0,,Its a little smaller (spaces where u could tour around or view) then i expected in terms of the outlook.
,,So much to see,5.0,,"It was an amazing place, the night we were there it was pouring outside, the effect this created on the glass with the water running down made it more memorable. When you are inside your not sure where to look first, there is so much colour to see in the plants and the trees as you walk around."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"A most enjoyable experience. The attention to detail is amazing, and we spent a beautiful morning in the Cloud Forest."
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"Not into gardens and plants but truly an amazing experience! Several platforms to walk out on offer great views not only in the gardens but outside also! Such a relaxing vibe, nice and cool place to be out of the heat of the day. Check times for misting sessions."
,,Amazing forest,3.0,,"Cloud forest is an attraction in the Gardens by the Bay. There is a large man-made waterfall with a forest-like impression. There is skywalk around the waterfall. For some senior people and children, they do not need to take the skywalk and can rather go straight up by elevator. A scenic view of Singapore can be seen while walking on the skywalk. Some Orchids and small plants are also available.
There is a nice souvenir shop at the exist and you can buy a variety of beautiful orchid accessories. Also there are small models of the beautiful Supertrees."
,,Gardens by the Bay.,5.0,,"Top of the list of things to do in Singapore. A must see attraction. Great value for money. Do the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, & the OCBC Sky Walk."
,,amazing,5.0,,it is amazing i really advise everybody to visit it. it will be better before sun set so you can see better
,,Hot day? Go here to cool off!,5.0,,It's an excellent man-made forest. You line up to take a lift to the top and then you walk your way down as you admire the plants and the view.

,,Very impressed,5.0,,"Loved this atrraction. Worth the effort, expense and the climb, not to mention the education along the way. Fantastic must see activity."
,,Must see as a man-made wonder,5.0,,I have been here around 7-8 times but I still get amazed as soon as I enter the cloud forest. It is a must see on how they have brought in all these plants and water to make a real cloud forest. I always visualize myself being in the 'Avatar' movie when I am there.. Lol.. thats how magical it is :)
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,I visited the place with my wife & the kid as well as my aunts. The place is cold but very nice. Felt like a real rain forest. Very informative & should say the facilities are top of the range fro visitors
,,Heaven on Earth,5.0,,An amazing breath taking man made mountain view surrounded by diverse common n uncommon plant and fountain. Open daily from 9am to 9pm in Gardens by the Bay near MBS.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Garden with flowing plants on the walls of 6-7 stories building with water falling from the top. There is beautiful garden on the top of the building with small ponds full of plants. Climbing down from the ramp takes you to various small museums of rock salt statues, human history and hidden garden ending in a museum ."
,,spectacular waterfall in a rainforest setting,4.0,,"Inside one of the domes, huge waterfall that you can go ""inside"" offers great views around the dome. The spray every 30 mins or so mist to create the cloud effect in the rainforest."
,,An air conditioned done!,5.0,,Excellent climate control. Very comfortable. We went Christmastime to see the Yule decorations. View from top is breathtaking. Could have spent all day here!
,,Nice experience,5.0,,We visited cloud forest with our 8 years old daughter. My family enjoyed a lot there. There are different types of trees and flowers to be seen inside and the waterfall is too good. You should bring some warm clothes as it is very cold inside.
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"This is my second time to visit here at Cloud Forest, Even though, it's quite too crowned this time. it's just a nice place to visit and enjoy walking around. Please bring your jacket it's really cold!"
,,Magnificent waterfall entrance,4.0,,"Sights to behold, must see, better even if you go in the evening as the lights comes on at the Gardens By the Bay. A bit chilly as the temperature needs to be maintained low to mimic the cloud forest."
,,Holiday,5.0,,"Loved it, I am terrified of heights but I did the walk. The views are beautiful. It's also a cooling comfort to the heat of Singapore. Definitely a must."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,Worth a visit. An excellent display of plants in an interesting dome. Not as hot and humid as I expected.
,,@ gardens by the bay.....amazing place to visit.,5.0,,"Words aren't enough to describe this place. You have to go and see for yourself. It has the world's tallest indoor waterfall and it has a beautiful ambiance. Explore the tropical highlands amidst orchids, pitcher plants and ferns from the cool-moist Tropical Montane region."
,,Okayish place,3.0,,"I love nature, and this place, though better than the flower dome, is quite terrible.. almost an amusement park. I wish they took cues from the botanic gardens and kept it simple."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"We just did a quick stroll through part of the Cloud Forest, due to time we had left. But as you enter, the first thing you see is an amazing waterfall garden. Very beautiful surroundings and worth the visit"
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,Cloud Forest is an amazing place with the world's tallest indoor waterfall at 35 meters and descend through the surreal mist-filled Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk. Highly Recommended for families with children!
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"During my last vising in Singapore, they were still constructing the area and all I could see was the huge tree like constructions in there. Now, I was very happy to visit this place. Not just that the place was well conceptualized, but it reminds me that there are people who still care for nature. I salute Singapore for taking care of the environment and proving that people can develop a place without destroying mother earth. Will be back again."
,,Awesome attraction,5.0,,"A must visit day + night, start with day and stamp for re-entry before 8:30pm. Spend 1 hour there + 1 hour at the flower dome."
,,Wow! What a place,5.0,,"We didn't know what to expect when we walked into the Cloud dome, as I didn't want to spoil the surprise of reading any reviews. So pleased I didn't read the reviews as they wouldn't do it justice. We know that when the Singaporeians build something it is always fantastic. They didn't let us down. As you enter you speak the first words as WOW! WOW! The waterfall. Then enjoy all the plants and carved animals as you walk around. It wasn't busy to get around."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Amazing place from start to finish. Not great if you don't like heights. Some of the most amazing plants, lots of lovely features"
,,Unique experience!!,5.0,,People who worked for this project have achieved beyond expectations. Have never seen anything like it. If you people want to see something unique then go for it!!
,,A man made paradise,5.0,,The cloud forest is build over 5-6 floors. Easily accessible for a person on wheelchair too. (Wheelchair is provided free of cost). The waterfall was beautiful.
,,Jaw dropping scale and lovely and cool,5.0,,"It is an amazing place to see. However, it can get very crowded at the weekend with the gangways clogged with people taking photos and selfies. Patience needed - lots of it."
,,Must Do in Singapore,5.0,,"The last time I visited Singapore they were just building the Gardens by The Bay, so this trip I was very keen to see what the hype was about.
I certainly wasn't disappointed, it was absolutely mesmerizing, the flora and fauna was out of this world, was certainly a highlight of our visit."
,,Best at night!,4.0,,"Best date location for the night, You'd want to make sure you have at least 2 hours depending on if you like spending time sightseeing."
,,"Amazing piece of architecture, or is it gardening??",5.0,,You wouldn't think that with the outside temperature closing in on 35 degrees celcius that you could find a place that would feel cold. But that's exactly the case when you walk through the doors into the cloud forest and feel the cool mist of water from the waterfall. Simply amazing that all of these plants could thrive in the one place in Singapore.
,,Escape the heat and enjoy the views,5.0,,Wonderfully cool dome to wander through. So many things to see and the walk from the top on the walkways is great.
,,Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,The Cloud Forest Conservatorium was a great place to visit. Brilliant display with a huge waterfall.
,,Incredible,5.0,,Cloud walk is amazing and is a must do. Waterfall and array of plants is incredible - great way to cool down too. Easy walk without having to take too many stairs.
,,Incredible,5.0,,Easy to get here using the MRT system. The cloud dome is also very cool inside so its great to adventure around when the weather is hot outside.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Highly recommended and not overpriced. You don't have to pay to get in, just for the Cloud Forest and/or the skyline walk. The main attraction is the super tree lightshow at around 8pm."
,,Diamond,5.0,,It was amazing...!!! It was so magical! A lot of trees flowers... a lot colours everywhere! Amazing waters! It was 3 fantastic hours ! Congrats!
,,A walk in the forest,5.0,,"Grab your camera, one of the highlights of a trip to Singapore, entry is inexpensive, this display offers multitudes of visual appeal. The static displays are fantastic and offer a nice break from the gradual ascent. There are so many aspects that catch your eye, particularly the lego garden!!"
,,Excellently maintained indoor waterfall and flora,5.0,,"Nice indoor waterfall, excellently maintained flora. Good to spend 2 hours with the family. Has Lift facilities, so if you have stairs challenged members works out great as well."
,,Escape the heat,5.0,,I loved the cloud forest... cool but humid... lots of plants and interesting sculptures... even with lots of people it's still reasonably easy to get around.
,,Awesome man made forest,5.0,,Forest feels. Awesome breath taking scenic view of Singapore. Huge variety of flora/crystal formation for educational purposes.
,,I lost my mind to a wonderful waterfall.,4.0,,It was a family trip and it was fantastic to see beautiful waterfalls and beautiful flowers. It is a blessing to have such a wonderful botanical garden in the middle of a hot city.
,,Very Disneylandish,2.0,,"Did not like this at all, very artificial looking, never before seen a waterfall made of concrete etc."
,,What a wonderful place!,5.0,,"Breathtakingly beautiful is what one can say, the building structure as much as the idea of it. What a exciting and good idea worth emulating by any number of cities. The waterfall that welcomes and cools you on entry to Cloud Forest sets the mood for the adventure in nature that lies ahead of all visitors.

The ticket staff, on my inquiry, recommended that we visit Cloud Forest after having visited the Flower Dome first. That was one correct advise for a visit in August heat. After spending 2 hours admiring botanicals, including the orchid special, Cloud Forest's mist embraced and cooled us as we enjoyed the trees and pathways above them.

Dont' hurry through the Marina Bay Gardens or any of the Domes or even the Grove. You need time for this but this time will be something you'd remember."
,,Wow,5.0,,Wow is the best word to describe this place. It's a must see attraction when going to Singapore. Amazing what they built inside. 5/5
,,Chilling experience,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is literally a sophisticated forest! To our luck it was raining heavily when we were in the cloud dome. The vertical gardening is worth appreciating. Though Singapore does not have any hills or forests naturally they have almost created one right in the middle of the city.
Go in this dome with 1-2 hours in hand and a nice camera, you are going to love the pics. Ensure that you have seen the whole dome till the top!"
,,Great Garden,5.0,,"This place is my favourite location at the Gardens by the Bay, the waterfall looks cool and the whole place is amazing."
,,Wonderland,5.0,,Cloud forest is just a magical place with waterfalls and glorious plants. The icing on the cake is the high walk around the canopy. Gotta do this if you are in Singapore
,,what a view,5.0,,"the huge indoor waterfall, the misting which happens every hour or so, walkways, gardens, orchids everywhere.. it really was a magical place."
,,Amazing!!!!!!,5.0,,Wonderful place to spend an evening. The dome has a waterfall at the entrance which sets the mood for the rest of the Dome sight seeing. Loved the place. Different levels have different trees and formations.
,,"Interesting, too bad it was closed",4.0,,"Honestly we bought the ticket without realizing the other part was closed for maintenance, although it has been stated somewhere... basically our mistake.

But i wasn't happy because I paid for the full price but only can enter one part of it.. which is sad.
The price of the ticket should have been reduced since the other part is under maintenance?

Otherwise, its pretty impressive, love the cold-ish weather, and the plants were pretty cool."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Cloud Forest began as a short stop off, but ended up being a highlight of the Singapore trip. The rainforest feel is incredible, with a very impressive array of plants. Highly recommend."
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,This is a must visit place in Singapore. The artificial water fall and the surroundings are made to look like a forest. The garden at the top was mesmerizing.
,,Must try...get drenched under the waterfall!,5.0,,"If you are afraid of cold or get wet, don't forget to bring your jacket or rain coat as you will be greeted by the freezing splashes from the waterfall at the entrance."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Wow I'm not into gardening what so ever but this place is worth a visit. Incredible display of plants and the waterfall is awesome.
,,A breath-taking experience!,5.0,,"During our most recent stay in Singapore, we visited the magnificent Gardens by the Bay. As we had a Singapore Airlines Stop-over Holiday package, we had been provided with passes allowing free admission to a number of attractions around Singapore. Included amongst those attractions were several located within the Gardens by the Bay.
The Cloud Forest was one such attraction. Using our passes, we were able to gain free admission and we were thereby able to enjoy the wonderful displays enclosed within a massive glass and metal structure.
There was quite a deal of walking up curved long walkways to the various levels to take in the views of the various trees, shrubs and plants growing in this artificial environment. The display which we found most appealing was the very large indoor artificial waterfall. Quite spectacular!
The Cloud Forest is well worth the admission fee, if you have to pay to enter. Even better when it is free!"
,,Cool relief,5.0,,"Visited with family. A lovely, cool escape from the heat of Singapore. It was absolutely beautiful. Really worth the entrance fee."
,,Never get enough with the view,5.0,,"After visiting Gardens by the bay, me and my wife continue our jaw dropping experience at the Cloud Forest , Singapore. The moment you enter the building, you will be in awe with the big indoor waterfall and also with how they put everything together. For us, its the same with how we felt with Garden by the bay, its just simply amazing!!! For people who afraid of hight like me, you just need to put all your guts together and explore the place. Make sure when you visit this place to explore every single corner of this place."
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,I can't imagine their concept of bringing the forest habitat to a city and with water falls and all forest flower species that is unimaginable. Very beautiful and stunning view. It's a must see place.
,,"Waterfalls, forests and clouds!",5.0,,"A man-made aura of clouds, mist at different levels, forest, and waterfalls. Just sit under it, get pampered by a little drizzle and just feel WOW! Or climb above for a 'walk in the mists'!"
,,"Inside a dome, a walk into the treetops",4.0,,"The huge dome, which is quite a beautiful structure, a winding pedestrian walkway rises into the air to give you a view of the botanics and geology at varying heights. It's quite a sight and the views are really dramatic revealing sheer drops. The info boards give you information about the various things you can see."
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"Breathtaking experience , very beautiful setups like a rain forest, people with vertigo issues be careful as the climb to top can be a bit dizzying. Enjoyed very much."
,,Awesome experience!,5.0,,This a man-made waterfall and a beautiful walking experience. You need to take a lift to the secret garden on top and then walk down through a ramp. The entire experience is totally worth it.
,,Artificial rainforest,4.0,,This is an artificial rainforest! There is a waterfall. Mist is coming out from the tower. I have been several rainforests. Cloud forest tries its best to mimic an actual rainforest. View from the top is amazing too. Great experience.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,We visited this as part of our trip to the gardens and we loved it. It is worth the climb to the top of the waterfall
,,Simply wow :o,5.0,,Synergy of Man's brains and the beauty of Nature ! Getting into Cloud dome was like being transported to a lush rainforest ...the waterfall is truly breathtaking . Please keep a few hours to soak in the experience and literally too if up for it :)
,,Worth visiting for the cost but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be,4.0,,"This is one of the 'must do' activities in Singapore but I'm not sure what quite differentiates it from any other winter garden type attraction. Yes, the height of the waterfall is quite something when you walk in, however, after that it is all quite the same. There are some information boards around to tell you what you are looking at but I think there could have been more."
,,This will take your breath away!,5.0,,"Absolutely magnificent!

I lost a good few hours walking through the beauty here. The Cloud Forest is set amid the stunning Gardens by the Bay and is a feature of the park not to be missed.

You can spend hours spotting rare and exotic plants and flowers, and really get lost in the sound of the waterfall. Make your way to the very top of the rain forest, and look down.

Its beautiful from every which way you look at it."
,,Rain Forest in the middle of the city.,4.0,,"Its really nice to feel that you are in a rain forest knowing you are in a city. its actually cold. simply because of the water which runs down from the water falls in side. you can see variety of plants and butterflies.
There is a small museum in the bottom of it as well"
,,One of the best parts of Garden By the Bay,5.0,,"This comes straight out of an Hollywood movie, would advise to take the more scenic way of walking to the top rather than escalator, also check the misting times in advance and leave only after watching the same."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Its a must do when you visit the gardens, pay for all the domes otherwise you will be sorry you missed it. Its beautiful and educational."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"This is a must see if you go to Singapore. For me this was my ""Happy Place."" As soon as I got into the dome I couldn't help smiling. The temperature in the dome was perfect even though it was hot outside. I thought it might be a bit humid with the mist being made to give it the cloud effect in the upper levels but it was just beautiful all around. There were so many beautiful plants and flowers. At the end it was very interesting in the museum showing what could happen if we do not take care of our environment around us."
,,Spectacular indoor forest and waterfalls,5.0,,"You cannot leave Singapore without visiting this location. Its simply awe-inspiring to see what they have done. Its a vertical garden with amazing flowers, plants and water falls. They have been so thoughtful and built bridges that protrude out so that people can have a better look at the mountain. Full marks to them! Please do not miss seeing the carnivorous plants.
Tip: It gets cold inside. Please carry a light sweater or shawl."
,,Nice,5.0,,Interesting. All man made. The waterfall was unique. Get to the top to see the view. Nice. Recommended
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay in July 2017, we spent two days wandering around this magical place, the cloud dome was my husbands fav spot, ( I was by no means disappointed)! Do yourself a favour and stay for the ""misting"" every 2 hours ( I think)!, release mist into the dome to replicate the plants natural habitat, it's simply amazing to watch, this is no little event, it's a real spectacle and so awesome to watch! The domes are lovely and cool, hordes of people, but it's very easy to get around, so,you don't feel hemmed in at all, wear good walking shoes, make the climb up the inner structure, keep an eye peeled for the driftwood masterpieces that are placed in amongst the gardens, they are so beautiful, and it's easy to miss them if you only have a fleeting glance around. What they have created there is truly amazing and an absolute high lite of our stay in beautiful Singapore!"
,,"an impressive feat of engineering, but you're going to spend a lot of time in lines",3.0,,"There is some educational content to this part of Gardens by the Bay — evidently it's teaching about how different tropical plants and trees adapt to various temperatures and altitudes — but the messaging was surprisingly incoherent, and I can't actually say what it is that I saw in Cloud Forest, though the dome is very impressive for sure. In an unpleasantly Disneylandish fashion, however, much of my time was spent waiting in line — to enter, to take the elevators to the top, and to get past the endless clusters of people blocking the path while they photograph each other. Unless you have a strong commitment to seeing all the top sights of Singapore, I recommend skipping Cloud Forest and spending the time outdoors in the various gardens. I know that's a minority view."
,,Out of This World,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a wonderful place. It is a massive climate controlled forest, cool under a huge glass dome. You can climb up to the top for amazing views of the city. There's an impressive waterfall which can be seen from the bottom, from the top where it flows over a precipice and from underneath/behind the torrent.
Beautiful shrubs, flowers and trees abound which make it a captivating stroll.
Next door is the Flower Dome which is beautiful too. A combo ticket can be bought for both and I'd highly recommend it. A fantastic place to visit."
,,Very nice,4.0,,A spectacular atmosphere with thousands of tourists as well. Sometimes it is more fun looking at the tourist tan at the plants. But the place is very nice!
,,Amazing Indoor Forrest,5.0,,"The Cloud Forrest is amazing, and a must visit when in Gardens By The Bay. Its much more enjoyable than the Flower Dome. You get great views, great flowers / plants, some art / sculptures, a great walk, and a waterfall shower! Definitely worth the visit."
,,Stunning place!,4.0,,Cool and nice place to visit but nothing much to do inside. The queue may look long but the management system is good. Try to avoid the crowd.
,,Breath-taking mountain views surrounded by diverse vegetation and hidden floral gems,5.0,,"Its one of the must visit place in Singapore. Its one of the attraction in the ""Gardens By The Bay"", Singapore. It has one of the biggest man made waterfalls, gives you the feeling of entering the real cloud forest. 6 levels to observe the whole lot of plantation done put there. The experience is fascinating and its a mustt mustt mustt visit place in Singapore."
,,A great escape from the heat!,5.0,,Just went to the cloud forest ($16 per adult). It was a lovely way to escape the heat and such a beautifully presented attraction.
,,Cool and refreshing option with plenty to see and photograph,5.0,,"This is a great option for those wanting to escape the heat of Singapore while still visiting a spectacular garden. The layout is well though out, the conservation education on point while being relatively convenient to travel to, especially if you are staying in the Marina Bay Area."
,,Unique Place!,5.0,,"The cloud forest is a unique and interesting place to visit in Singapore, it is an amazing integration of nature and engineering done in a really tasteful way - makes you think you are on the set of Avatar!"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,Fabulous place. Raved already about it in the Gardens by the Bay review. Loved it loved it. If I lived in Singapore I would go all the time.
,,rainy Sunday joy,4.0,,"First heavy rainfall for two weeks and I asked the cab driver: can you drop us under a shelter? No worries, this s Singapore. From entrance walk up under a sheltered walkway to the ticket office and enter the domes. Skywal was closed obviously during the rain period. Cloud forest and Flower dome are good to spend 2-4 hours depending on your mood.Discover what you have not seen before in the flora and fauna, don't forget to take hundreds of pictures."
,,Man made rain forest,4.0,,IF you love to see greenery than this is the place. Amazing waterfall and man made rain-forest. Good learning experience for school going kids and lots of walking. It is advisable to carry a light jacket / sweaters as it is pretty cold inside...
,,Both is best,5.0,,"When it comes to choosing between the two dome, the best choice is, do both. We were not sure about spending the money, but were not disappointed. Comfortabe shoes and a water bottle is a must....then take your time as you stroll through water falls and plant exhibits....what an experience."
,,Hi-light of Singapore,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome in Singapore is an amazing piece of engineering inguenuity The vast array of plants combined into this Dome have created their own ecosystem, to the point you believe you have entered a real Cloud Forest.
If you only do one thing in Singapore, do this.
I give the Cloud Forest two thumbs up."
,,You will not see anything like this anywhere else!,5.0,,"Always love waterfall, first time to see a man made one. Excellent design and paying attention to details. You will see the waterfall when you enter, everybody will stand there to take photos. Later you will make one round to take the lift to level 6, beware if you are afraid of heights, You will walk on the outer pathway and observe different and many flowers. There is also observation deck for waterfall, You will go down till you pass through the secret garden. As it is man made as you will not see it elsewhere."
,,Unique site,5.0,,Most attractive. Very clean and maintained without any scope to offer grievances. Escalators are provided for climbing to the top so as to enjoy every bit of forest while descending.
,,EXCELLENT,4.0,,A must visit when you visit Gardens by the bay. It has a huge waterfall...an excellent backdrop for pics. The temp is controlled & pleasing. Its good to see so many trees & plants at various levels.A lift takes us up to the last floor & we come down walking across varoius floors.
,,Hidden gem! #1 thing to do,5.0,,You must must must do this! It's magical and seriously feels like out of a movie.. you have to go see it to get the experience and realise what all the fuss is about 👌
,,Gardens by the bay relax,5.0,,"A walk arround the gardens by the bay is free and very relaxing. They only charge for entrance to the cloud forest and flower dome.
If you want to visit cloud forest or flower dome plan ur visit arround afternoon so that you can cover flower dome first and then folowed by a vusit to the loud forest in the evening. The flower dome is best viewed under natural light in the afternoon. However the cloud forest is beter after sun sets.expect some crowd and keep 2 hours per dome for ur visit unless you have visites before and want to skip some of it :)"
,,"Extraordinary, beautiful attraction!",5.0,,I have never been anywhere quite like this building. It is magnificent and definitely recommended if you are in Singapore. There were people of all age groups and everyone appeared to be really enjoying themselves.
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,When you visit Singapore you are ready to experience an ultra modern city interspersed with a lot of history. What really makes you look at the city in a different light is this conservatory alongside the Flower Dome. Our son is a typical sport man 12 year old and yet even he was taken aback my these two places. I would recommend a day spent here!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful cold forest with mist,feel like in the clouds.nice waterfall and the dome is cold with moist like a real tropical forest."
,,Excellent,5.0,,The cloud forest is fantastic. We were there at the time of the misting and it added a whole new level to the experience of the cloud forest. The canopy walk is breath taking and a must. It offers excellent views of Singapore.
,,Only to Say - Amazing,5.0,,Very speciall artifitial water falls made nicely indoor with nice temp of 23 - 25 C and nice route of the tour At the top floors you will find the lost paradise and amazing flowers can be seen you will feel with actual water fall
,,A beautiful indoor forest of trees .,5.0,,A beautiful place to visit. A beautiful place to see . A beautiful place to share. Need tickets to go inside of this beautiful cold forest. There is a coffee shop as well inside of this cold forest. A beautiful forest / A beautiful color of life.
,,Must do,5.0,,"If you're scared of heights, this isn't the place for you to visit. Just look around on the lower floors. Otherwise it offers some amazing views, and with mist, you really feel like you're in the clouds. Beautiful display of flowers"
,,a must!!,5.0,,"the cloud forest is one part of the marina bay gardens and in my opinion the most beautiful part. it's unbelievable how much work, thought and money have gone into making this artificial mountain, forest and fall."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a heavenly place, I'm surprised to see how they have created this place. Think of a mountain inside of a dome . Nicely designed, nice waterfall ."
,,Beautiful Man-made creation,5.0,,"I've been here twice and I am still amazed with the structure of this place.
I like the flower dome but I love Cloud Forest.
The plants and flowers are really fresh. The dome is cold with moist. I haven't hiked in a real tropical forest so I guess I know the feeling now.
A big thumbs up to this place!"
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,Excellent. Part of the Garden by the Bay. Definitely cannot me missed. Misting happens every two hours.
,,WOW!!,5.0,,This is a World of Wonders for young & old alike. Just do it!! The waterfall is just awesome and the misty clouds are unforgettable. By revealing too much the suspense will be out. Reasonable pricing and just awesome is the word for it
,,Great place to spend a few hours,5.0,,Amazing gardens in the heart of Singapore. Cloud forest invloves a bit of walking and heights are optional. Offers a great view of the city. Air conditioned too which was a pleasant surprise.
,,Site to behold,5.0,,"Brilliant venue along with the Flower Garden next door. Well worth the entrance fee. The design of the attraction is spellbinding. A ""must do"" whilst in Singapore."
,,"Excellent way to spend an hour or so, highlight of Gardens by the Bay!",5.0,,"I have walked through Gardens by the Bay a few times, and finally decided it was time to check out those cool glass domes (aka Cloud Forest and Flower Dome). The Cloud Forest was a really cool experience. I bought my tickets ahead of time on Voyagin (for both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) so that I paid $23.00 SGD as opposed to the $28.00 SGD tickets cost on the Gardens website (as a non-Singaporean). I easily downloaded my ticket and was able to scan the ticket directly off my phone, so very easy to get in and out.
I arrived at the Cloud forest around 9:30 am which was a perfect time on a Friday morning. The forest was essentially empty and I enjoyed a lot of the views on my own, uncluttered by selfie taking swarms.
In retrospect, I was a little disappointed I didn't think of getting an audio tour. They are available at the ticketing booth which I skipped when I bought my ticket online. If you are interested in that, don't forget to pick one up before you set foot in the Forest.
Overall, well maintained, very cool (both temperature and sights) biodome that adults and children a like will enjoy. Highly recommend!"
,,A very Educational visit,5.0,,"The Cloud forest is certainly a place to visit to learn about the flora & fauna at different altitudes. I have been there numerous times when visitors are in town and I do enjoy it every time
A cool place to visit on a hot day"
,,Visit Cloud Forest at Garden by the Bay,5.0,,"Personally i feel it is best to visit during 6pm to 7:30pm so you can have a sunset and night view, a very nice indoor waterfall however take note that it is quite humid inside, colder than Flower Dome i think, bring along your jacket :)"
,,Nice plants. Very refreshing,4.0,,Very well done with many plants and trees to nice. Nice view from the sky walks. You will get wet but it's quite refreshing in Singapore's hot weather. A bit expensive though.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Really wonderful place to visit, I was very impressed with this attraction inside Gardens by the Bay. Perfect place to take a lot of photos! This is one of the few attractions you have to pay"
,,It will blow you away!!,5.0,,What an amazing place. Such a wonderful experience with great views from the walkways. In Singapore - a must visit.
,,Lovely visit,4.0,,Nice & cooling area. The indoor waterfall that greets you the moment you walk through the door is just amazing! Great for young & old.
,,Interesting !,5.0,,I think is the biggest indoor waterfall ! So is very interersting and I think it worth visiting ! Very interesting especially for kids and you can make a beautiful pictures
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Best part of the Gardens. Worth the price of entry, plus very cooling on a hot day. A must see for Singapore."
,,Imaginary Experience,4.0,,It's a nice thing to feel the way we feel original. It has many spots to take pictures. We enjoyed having so much attracted backgrounds
,,Nice,4.0,,A nice construction and explanations why cloud forests are important to the world. Takes about an hour to complete
,,Romantic!,5.0,,This hosts the largest indoor waterfall that i know of. Its gigantic and beautiful. Lives up to its image. Visit this place if you have some extra time in your itinerary...
,,Great attraction,5.0,,they really know how to impress this structure is very impressive it is well worth a visit the view from insided is well worth it
,,Too artificial!!,3.0,,"Unless you are really fascinated by diverse flora even in an artificial setup, this may not be the place to go. There's a huge waterfall (artificial of course) which could be fairly interesting for school children but otherwise not much value."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,This was the absolute highlight of my visit to gardens by the bay (and Singapore). I cannot do justice to the experience in words.
,,Wonderful Respite,5.0,,"Walking into the Cloud Forest after coming from the balmy weather outside is very nice - the cool air and mist from the waterfall (a popular photo op) is very refreshing. As you go up and down the mountain, you get a chance to see many exotic flowers and plants native to mountainous regions, from orchids to vines, and even carnivorous plants. The exhibits inside also draw attention to climate change and how fragile these natural ecosystems are.
I highly recommend setting aside at least an hour to fully enjoy the Cloud Forest."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,So much plant over there Waterfall spot photo is unique Cold air and moist place Nice experience to go there
,,Didn't meet the expectations,3.0,,Nothing so great in it. The waterfall seems very artificial. Not so cold so as to require any extra clothing. Just one hour visit is enough.
,,Stunning Beauty !!!!!!,4.0,,This a must see attraction in Singapore. You feel amazed what a human mind is capable of dreaming. Be ready with your SLR Cameras as you can't stop shooting as there are so many places to get a perfect snap !!!!!!
,,A dream of nature,5.0,,Singapore is one of the few carbon-negative cities in the world. that is because it cres for its environment and not more so than to create a destination like Gardens by the Bay. The structure is great design and shows the gardens that are created in an atmospgere that offers some relief from the heat outside but that too is special. Singapore is green through and through.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"When visiting the gardens, this place is a must see. Amazing and tranquil place that is a vast contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city."
,,Amazing visit,5.0,,"These guys know how to do it. It´s mandatory visit the cloud forest, and check all the exhibition at the same time you feel the smell of the waters in the cloud forest"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Fully air conditioned during the day, very pleasant to walk around for hours, spectacular floral displays"
,,As if I am in the world of Avatar,4.0,,"Well, you have to pay an exorbitant entry fee, and if you count the per minute cost it is scary but the experience is well worth it."
,,A Modern wonder of nature.,5.0,,Just such a clever and special place to go with so much packed in. Very well designed and spectacular views all around.
,,nice relaxing experience,5.0,,This was a very enjoyable place to visit after visiting the big garden next door the waterfall is great worth a look
,,Amazing,5.0,,"If you think that Singapore is too small to have a bio diverse ecological system, Singaporeans just challenged the nature. if you in Singapore and you can do only one thing Visit this dome."
,,A must see,5.0,,This is something everyone who visits Singapore must do . Caters for all ages and the handicapped . A breath of freash air .
,,Must visit attraction,5.0,,"Do not miss this
A very well done place that has been developed with so much love that the plants simply thrive
It boasts of audio visual experience as well
Remember to not take the lift down though can spend hours here
A walk through clouds is also possible"
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,Amazing place.the falls is amazing. The dome is fully air conditioned. Cloud walk is a bit frightening for those who are afraid of heights. Lots of attractions inside the dome. Will certainly go back to relax.
,,An amazing achievement,5.0,,"A fascinating collection of different forna,including a display of orchids unparalleled anywhere.The architecture is also worthy of special mention."
,,Like a Fantasy World,5.0,,"I loved Cloud Forest.

This should sum up my review but I have to write minimum 100 words. So here it goes .. if you are going to the Garden by the Bay, don't miss the Cloud Forest. Many times I felt like I was part of the movie - kind of in a garden in a space ship. This is wonderfully & tastefully built. The walk is wonderful and comfortable. The temperature inside is a bit cold - so you may consider taking an extra cloth - light cardigan/jacket. If I was a citizen of Singapore, I think I would have opted for an annual or life time membership of this forest just so that I can come and sit in this fantasy market whenever I felt like."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,It's really breath-taking! The waterfall is so beautiful! It's a bit cold inside but I had a jacket with me. The best thing is the walkway. It's just really freaking pretty.
,,Great Conservatory,5.0,,A real experience that one should not miss when in Singapore. The creation is truly world class and the ambience and maintenance is magnificent.
,,Cloud Forest with 3 kids,5.0,,"This deserves a 5 star just because it is so cool to walk into after the heat of Singapore! It is so well organised, clean and there are no bottlenecks of people even though it was busy when we went. There are wide pathways, ramps and elevators so easy to navigate if you want to avoid the few steps that there are. When you first walk in it is so impressive with the huge waterfall. There are lots of interesting pieces of art dotted about and the whole thing is really impressive. It cost us about 100 SD for 2 adults and three kids but this also got us into the Flower Dome."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I love being there. It's a great experience. The waterfall, cave, the view, the flowers. I would encourage people who love flowers to go"
,,Day visit,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay this attraction is a must to include in the gardens visit.The top attraction is the regulated operation of the waterfall, a must see atrraction within the enclosure."
,,Really Impressive,5.0,,"Really impressive structure and design, really worth a visit while you are in Singapore. It is a relatively small building, but it is very clever how you snake about it, so that you can view everything properly. Very beautiful and interesting place."
,,If you like trees and bushes.,3.0,,"If you like trees and bushes and waterfalls and have nothing better to do, visit. $16 Singapore per adult. Not really my thing but each to his or her own. I could not recommend it."
,,A Must-See Along with the Flower Dome,5.0,,Just as spectacular as the flower dome and worth the price of admission. There is a multi-story waterfall and gorgeous plants of all kinds. There was also a wonderful display of stalagmites and large geodes which we particularly enjoyed. Don't miss this when you are in Singapore. It is a something well-worth seeing.
,,Simply stunning in here,5.0,,"This is quite remarkable and best of all it's air-conditioned inside.
Well worth having a look at and you can wander around at your own pace and really enjoy the nature on show as well as the cool.
The indoor waterfall is o.k, but the nature and walk is brilliant.
Great value and really worth a look."
,,Amazing structure!,5.0,,"You get a real sense of being in the clouds and up in the mountains. You have some great views of Singapore bays here but what you see visually inside is quite stunning. The flora and fauna all around and rising up is beautiful... they literally made a mountain high vertical garden!

There are a lot of tourists about but everyone is busy taking pictures and walking along the pathway, no one really minds you stopping or slowing down to snap a picture, so as long as you are a tourist taking pictures and enjoying the scenery you won't be bothered."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"What an amazing concept. Never seen anything like this anywhere else in the world. Every tourist destination puts up lots of water slides, roller coasters and such expensive thrill items. But this one is so educational and such a thrill as well; a different kind of thrill. Its amazing to see so many plant collections from all parts of the world. Singapore has many attractions devoted exclusively to nature (flora and fauna). These kinds of places are good for kids and adults. I could spend hours here admiring all the variety of greenery. Amazing and awesome concept."
,,Outstanding.....,5.0,,"Cloud Forest really is outstanding. The waterfall as you walk in is amazing. Once you get to start going up the views from the top are grand. It is a daunting walk as you make your way down again, but it really is worth the visit."
,,Stunning place.,5.0,,"You get here through the Gardens of the Bay behind Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
You will have to pay a ticket but it's totally worth it. The tower construction is truly astounding, with all the plants, flowers and waterfalls. The suspended bridge to come down is really scenic. Amazing."
,,Excellent !!,5.0,,"Probably one of my favorite attraction when in Singapore (already did it 3 times) This glass house is incredible. There is a waterfall in it, many path, beautiful plants... a must see"
,,Amazing indoor display and a serious grand scale,5.0,,This is part of the Garden at the bay and should not be missed. The dome and the Forrest with in are truly amazing.
,,Spectacular!!,5.0,,"We weren't going to visit this attraction because we figured it was just ""another botanical garden."" I'm so glad we did! The whole place is just fantastic with so much to see and walk around. Definitely worth it!"
,,An amazing journey,4.0,,It was dark when we arrived and there were not too many people around. The journey takes you high into the world of Cloud Forest.The lighting effects were really good. A unique experience.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Again you say a lot of flowers, even mini orchids (amazing) but it is s beautiful, the architecture, the waterfall indoors. Perfect place to go in case of rain."
,,The mist is all kinds of moist,4.0,,"The other scores and reviews should make it clear that you should visit on your holiday. If you are a new expat, you should probably get an annual pass: this will save you cash by your second visit which will definitely happen if you have friends or family who plan to sleep on your couch for the best part of a week.

HOT TAKE: Be there for mistings, daily at 10.00am, 12.00pm, 2.00pm, 4.00pm, 6.00pm, 8.00pm. Probably the only time you will feel the temp drop to 23 degrees in SG. Misty."
,,The most espectacular indoor forest!!!,5.0,,"These was one of my favorites attractions in Singapure it simply stunning believe me, like nothing else in the world. It an incredible experience it is so big takes you about 2 hours if you really want to appreciate it, this is a MUST in Singapure believe me."
,,Really enjoyed our visit.,5.0,,"Really enjoyed our visit, very clever design. Has water features including waterfalls , would recommend visiting if in Singapore"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"As we entered, we saw people high in the air, near the roof of the dome and wondered if we'd make it to the top at our age. However, a very nice touch is that there are lifts, marked for the use of infirm or elderly people only. At our age, we definitely qualified, so we avoided the need to climb up, but enjoyed our downhill stroll once we reached the top. This is a man-made ""forest"" with a waterfall. The paths wind around the central part of the tower. There are views out of the windows of the dome and always the sound of water cascading downwards with plants to admire on the way down. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen anywhere before."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I went to Cloud dome and flower dome. Both are very good but cloud dome is my favourite. It is like something from a movie. Huge. Impressive. Amazing. Do not miss this in Singapore.
,,Check it out - even if you're afraid of heights.,4.0,,"This exhibit was most delightful and while I couldn't walk on that cloud walkway (whatever it's called) because of my fear of heights, they nicely accommodated people with elevators and/or escalators so you could still go to the top. Found it most enjoyable."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Must visit ! What a brilliant idea of creating an artificial waterfall rainforest in a glass dome .... loved it ! Felt like in heaven around the falls !
,,Fantastic place to visit,5.0,,You have to visit this place while in Singapore. Very cool and big place. It is also very good to visit on a hot day where it is cool and chilled inside.
,,A MUST see place,5.0,,Give yourself heaps of time though as there is so much to see. Stay for the night shows at 7.45pm and 8.45pm the kids will LOVE it!!!
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Of the two conservatories, this was the most memorable: the path winding around, the range of vegetation and steamy atmosphere."
,,Great place - don't overlook this.,5.0,,"We visited both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest during one day. The Cloud Forest was definitely my favorite! The air in the dome is so fresh and full of oxygen. Wonderful after a hot day outside. The lush and green is magnificent, and then I haven't even started talking about the waterfall... Take the elevator up to the top of the Cloud Forest, and then walk down the paths. It's big, fresh and magnificent. You won't regret it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I would be extra for complimenting this but it's a must destination. This definitely worth a try! If you visit Singapore without going to Cloud Forest, then book a ticket to Singapore and visit it"
,,Cloud Forest,4.0,,Located in the gardens by the bay. the cloud forest is one of the most mystic and beautiful things to see in singapore. Must go there when rush is less though.
,,Just superb and breath taking,5.0,,Separate entrance free from the surrounding gardens. Worth every cent. Stop touching the plants people!
,,Awesome display,5.0,,Spent a few hours looking through the two domes. Really breathtaking and flowers and displays just wonderful.
,,"Absolutely amazing, I love it",5.0,,"The best spot i have ever been in singapore, must-do action in singapore for everybody, very futuristic"
,,Excellent place to be,5.0,,"Feel refreshed from the busy streets, busy work schedule. Come here and enjoy the magic of nature. Climb to the top for magical feel and views. Must visit place in Singapore."
,,Spectacular Attraction!,5.0,,This is part of the Gardens by the Bay. It is spectacular the way it was created in that you actually feel as if you are in the jungle away from civilisation. Don't miss the huge waterfall. You can visit this attraction on it's own or buy a combo ticket that includes the Flower Dome. Not to be missed!
,,The highlight of our trip!,5.0,,"The moment you enter the Cloud Forest dome you will be blown away by the gigantic foundation in front of you! It is breath-taking, and extremely well maintained! Everywhere you look there are beautiful plants, and water flowing through the indoor Forest. The views above, when walking on the walkways are amazing, and some fantastic photos can be taken of both the inside of the dome, and looking out over the water towards Singapore City!
This place is a MUST if visiting Singapore! You will love it!"
,,Must try,5.0,,"Honestly speaking I was not really interested in this place. Since my niece keep asking me to enter here I decided to join.

Once entered forest it was my totally excited. We can see many kind of plant which is collected from everywhere in the world. On top of that I can feel oxygen is everywhere.

Fir this visit I couldn't take enough time but next time I want to visit again and want to spend more time discover more."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Great experience for family, friends, and young children. The exhibit was very informative as well as beautiful."
,,Out of the heat into the cool forest,3.0,,"Very nice and interesting, we found this a great place to visit with children in the middle of the day as you were out of the heat, no time constraints and you could do this all at your leisure and sit down when you needed to. We underestimated the time to do the whole complex. You can do this quickly if your short on time but if you have the day, plan out the two inside exhibits during the heat of the day with breaks and leave the outside gardens either very early morning or to do later Towards evening. The night lights are great but you would find that better to leave as a seperate outing for children as that would be a very tiring day"
,,Dramatic,5.0,,Amazing spectacle. Not what I expected. Really enjoyed it all. Great scenery and arrangement of plants.
,,So enjoyable,5.0,,"Thoroughly breathtaking, refreshing and so many species of flowers. Our only disappointment, no labels. We are very knowledgeable of plants, but we did think it would be good for those who aren't and it would assist us with the ones we didn't know"
,,Ultimate!!,5.0,,"This was my absolute fave, beautiful plants and growing walls everywhere! The waterfall was lovely. The whole place is nice and cool so it is also an awesome way to escape the heat. I spent a whole hour in here. You take a lift up to level 6 and make your way down, on the way there are minerals to look at and little movie clips to educate you on global warming, current impacts to the environment and ways to help. Upon exiting you can get a re-entry stamp which will allow you to enter again up until 8:30pm."
,,Very well presented,5.0,,"Lovely and cool out of the heat. We thoroughly enjoyed the walk through the rain forest. Worth checking times so you can experience the misting. Good use of elevators to get you up quickly. The suspended walkways may not be to everyone's liking, but there are stairs or elevator options. Great views of the skyline."
,,Rainforest Paradise,4.0,,When you enter Cloud Forest you are greeted with a spectacular indoor waterfall. Even though you are surrounded by rainforest vegetation it is lovely and cool.
,,Boring,3.0,,Likewise nothing u will miss if not visited. In ur ticket u will find some fixed dates when they are to close for maintenance. One day for the cloud forest and another day for the other dome. For that in my 4 days tour I had to wait for a common day.
,,Wow wow wow,5.0,,Totally breath taking place to visit. Never seen anything like it. The water fall inside is insane. And being able to walk all around it was an experience in itself. Recommend going at night time it makes it all the more special being lit up.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was my highlight of our trip to Singapore, absolutely stunning and unlike anything you will ever see elsewhere."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful Indoor Waterfall at Gardens By The Bay. Visitors can see the waterfall here. There is not jus waterfall, there are Earth Check and others."
,,Cool....,4.0,,"If you are going to Singapore and Gardens by the Bay, then find an hour to wander through the cloud forest. Beautiful and cool inside...the giant waterfall and mistfall make it a lovely setting. It is an artefical structure...but well laid out and thousands of beautiful plants that vary as you work your way up."
,,Second visit did not disappoint,5.0,,On this trip I was able to share this wonderful place with my husband and daughter. We were all delighted at such a spectacular attraction.
,,Innovation and well designed,5.0,,"I was amazed by the entire dome. The way all of the plants are placed to create this ginormous plant mountain with a giant indoor waterfall. Photos might look better during the day, but my photos at night looked alright too."
,,Cloud forest bio dome,5.0,,Superb design and well worth a visit. A lot put into a deceptively large space. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
,,Out of the world,5.0,,"I wouldn't know how to describe this.
It's ecstatic! You need to feel this to understand what this is all about. Its worth the time and money to the hilt.
The cloud forest is in a huge dome. The dome is a structural wonder by itself. The forest is the next wonder. The way the numerous vegetation has been maintained is te next wonder. How this has been conceived is wonder again. A must visit if you reach anyway close to this amazing country."
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"I was simply disapointed with the whole Gardens by the Bay experience, including the Cloud Forrest. It's way too structured."
,,Very cool,5.0,,Very impressed with the water fall and the sky bridges that take you around it. located in gardens by the bay and definately recommend a visit.
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,We just loved The Cloud forest. It's really well made and fantastic to spend 1 hr or so walking in between tree tops. Great picture oppotunities are around evry corner. A must go when in Singapore.
,,World of Plants,4.0,,Should visit garden by the bay if you're in Singapore. Its just have the best collection of the different types of plant which would possible to see in one place. Its a huge place. I love to visit here again with my friends and family. Must List
,,My granddaughter call it the waterfall,5.0,,We are regular visitors to the cloud forest. The entrance feature a man make fall which immediately cool visitors down and captivate them. A perfect spot to capture a few pictures. A few minute leisure stroll to the inside and an elevator will take you to the lost world. Wonderful flora awaits you as you stroll down the spiral walkway back down. Take in a short film on global warming on your way out .
,,An absolute must visit attraction.,5.0,,This was our second time visiting and the Cloud Forest has lost none of its charm. One of a few attractions I would suggest are an absolute must visit even if you are only in Singapore for a stopover.
,,An absolute must see in Singapore,5.0,,"- There are certain things you must do while visiting Singapore and this is one of them.
- We had never seen anything like this before. We loved every minute we were here.
- DO take the sky-walk it will give you a BRILLIANT views of the city, and across Singapore Bay.
- We took lots of pictures from sky-walk.
- We came at the end of the day so we could see the lights on the trees come on and we stayed to watch the light show which was worth staying for.
- This place requires lots of walking.
- This place is huge and very clean.
- A wonderful experience at a world class attraction.

Note: Good to go there in afternoon for picture. If you are not the garden fan and just there for a chill walk then it take you around 1 hr only for this dome."
,,An engineering and landscaping masterpiece!,5.0,,"Lovely and cool inside the dome. It can be a bit scary if you don't like heights, but the plants are so beautiful and the waterfall is so cooling after being outside in the Singapore heat. Absolutely amazing, even if you are not a garden lover."

,,Impressive greenhouse #1,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is one of two wonderful greenhouses in Gardens By the Bay. Take the elevator all the way up and then follow the bridges down through the different sections of the exhibition. This greenhouse is by far my favorite.
,,A Manmade Marvel,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is one of the domes in the Gardens by the Bay complex. The entire dome is temperature controlled and one can see the various types of plant life found the tropical rain forests here. A amazing and very informative place to go to especially with kids.
,,You have got to see this to believe it,5.0,,"I think this is six storeys of man made mound with a fresh cooling waterfall cascading down. Along the side of this mound are some amazing plants, orchids and greenery. This is truly amazing and a must see."
,,Artificial Garden,4.0,,"If you are a nature lover & up for long walks, then you will enjoy this attraction.

Upon entering the place, we were greeted with a waterfalls which is quite soothing & relaxing. As we entered farther, you would definitely enjoy the different flora & fauna that decorated the attraction.

You will go up to the topmost floor to just view the sceneries below. And you would enjoy if you are a nature lover and are not afraid of heights. Otherwise, this one is a definitely no no."
,,Good for plant lovers,4.0,,One of the dome in garden by the bay. It has several levels and they have awesomely created rainforest environment. They have tried to educated people of its district Ion and need for conservation.
,,Spevtaculat,5.0,,"We visited both the Cloud Forrest and the Flower Dome and they were excellent. I really enjoyed the subtle changes of each layer of the cloud forest. My 6 year old loved the walkways and the views over the dome, gardens and surrounding areas."
,,Manmade but very impressive,5.0,,"I didn't know you could make an indoor six story waterfall but apparently you can. To be visited with the flower dome, this impressive exhibit is not to be missed. Go to the top and work your way down. Enjoy the plants and great views."
,,Great on a hot day,4.0,,And is well worth the time - lots to see and very well presented I only wish we could have spent more time looking around
,,Meh.,3.0,,I really liked the Gardens by the Bay but thought this was just meh. The big waterfall was cool but otherwise though the rest was just ok.
,,Love this Forest,5.0,,"There are two domes to visit in the Gardens by the Bay, we coming from California, loved this dome. The waterfall is impressive, but as you start going through this venture, it just is so impressive how many beautiful vines and flowers are everywhere. The sculptures within the displays, it truly is magnificent. We were on a time crunch and wished we would have had more time to spend here. It is a tad cold, so bring a light jacket, just for this dome."
,,Miracle,5.0,,I was so sweat before enter the dome. When the doors opened I was so relief because it is cool inside. The first image was the waterfall.so refreshing.so beautiful. I can't describe it. Visit it. It is a miracle.
,,A must-see when visiting Singapore!,5.0,,"Our family has visited Singapore twice and both times we've visited the Conservatory Domes at Gardens by the Bay, they are awesome! On this trip, our sons were 16 & 18 yrs old, and they enjoy walking through the Domes as much as we do, particularly the Cloud Forest Dome which is quite spectacular. It is approx 6 storeys high and you enter to see a very high man-made mountain covered with tropical plants and a very high 35m waterfall cascading down from the top, it's an awesome sight! You then follow an ascending path that winds its way around and up through lush and misty tropical gardens, with lookouts near the top and over the waterfall, until you reach the top. You are rewarded with amazing views of everything below and also outside the Dome, including the SuperTrees and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Anyone who is scared of heights may find the height of the paths at the top a real challenge. The Domes are open 9am-9pm and cost $28 per adult to visit both Domes. It is a great activity during the heat of the day as it is much cooler inside the Domes."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"visited this a few times, take a jumper/ pullover, jumper is maybe not the best choice of words, you get very high up on the walkways"
,,Waterfall,5.0,,"You wander around inside this man made structure and are in awe of the waterfall, the plants and the way everything just flows together. To see the many different orchids just growing on virtually nothing makes ones envious, but nature works its magic. The thought and workmanship that went into all aspects of this forest is inspiring and takes your breath way.Nothing was too much trouble. The only criticism is we would have liked more plants to be named."
,,Cloud forest,4.0,,Very cooling.quite crowded during the weekend.but it is worth a visit.must visit harden by the bay when you are in singapore
,,Impressive!,5.0,,The technology in this place is amazing. Nature lovers will appreciate the detail of the plant varieties. Very beautiful

Air conditioned with restrooms and elevators for those with mobility restrictions. Lots of interesting plants and sculptures are scattered throughout.

,,Incredible experience.,5.0,,Great place to visit. Beautiful in many ways. Worth the entrance fee. Highly recommended. Worth a visit.

,,"Stunning indoor waterfall, beautiful!",5.0,,Beautiful indoor waterfall and great gardens. Was so good to get out of the heat and into this cool 'forest'. Highly recommended.
,,AMAZING!! Has to be the best in the world!,5.0,,"Wow wow wow!!! We loved every minute we were here. It may have cost $28 to go into both conservatories but it was well worth it considering the quality of the trees, plants and general cleanliness of the entire Gardens by the Bay.

Even on the hottest of Singaporean days, relief can be found here and with amazing things to see.

Take your time, explore the outside gardens as well and even take yourself a picnic to enjoy in the many grassy areas scattered around!!

Congratulations on a wonderful display and thank you to al of the friendly and helpful staff!"
,,Beautiful and cool!!! Worth seeing.,5.0,,"You can use headphones, go in a tour group or just stroll around at your own leisure. It's a lovely temperature inside as they need to keep the dome cool. It has wheelchair access all the way through,lifts or you can walk/stroll around."

,,Wonderland,5.0,,"Such a lovely experience - you could spend a day here and still not see everything. The ability to get close-ups of the flowers and orchids is great. I was able to take some magnificent photographs which I have made into a calendar for 2018, as a souvenir. The ferns, and the foliage are a gardener's delight. Do make time to visit this wonderful installation."
,,Beautiful Man made wonder,5.0,,"Beautifully designed forest with huge waterfall. the place is totally glass covered in a Dome shape and therefore A perfect way to escape the heat and enjoy cool air and lush vegetation!! A great variety of orchids, plants, fish and other things to be found in this massive air conditioned cloud. Roam around, see and be Happy to be here."
,,A walk to remember,5.0,,One word - UNFORGETTABLE. This is a must visit place when you're in Singapore as well as the Flower dome. Imagine fresh air encapsulated. Simply wonderful.
,,close to nature,4.0,,An amazing view when you stepped into the dome. The manmade waterfall bring you to the wild. You can walk to each level for a panorama view. Prepare a jacket as it will cold inside.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Can only say it was breath taking the drop of the water fall as you first walk in to the many displays on you walk around the different displays
,,"What an experience, but do you mind heights?",5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay, you have to visit the Cloud Forest. Containing the worlds largest indoor waterfall, this is the first thing you see on entry. But every level holds a hidden treasure. The metal walkways hanging over open space are a little unnerving if you don't like heights, but force yourself. You wont be disappointed. This is spectacularly designed and very different from anything I had seen or visited before. Absolutely loved it.
Although the Gardens by the Bay are free to enter (this is within the Gardens), you do have to pay a fee but I would say well worth it."
,,Take a jumper,4.0,,"Really good trip up and down the forest with spectacular foliage, shame there wasn't wildlife included but good nonetheless. Take a jumper as it is a bit chilly"
,,Beautiful rainforest place,5.0,,"Cloud forest in Singapore is must to visit , greenery water falling from top . Beautiful view from top , we all enjoyed a lot walking from top to down with amazing beautiful greenery and surrounding view."
,,A magic paradise on earth!,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful places on earth! The miracle of human civilization! The artificial waterfall inside the green paradise is one of a kind, a true piece of art! The artificial mountain has many levels where you can walk and explore! The hidden gardens just before the exit are magnificent!! From the top you can see the Marina bay sands hotel. Unbelievable place, worths the 20 dollar entrance fee. Highly recommended!!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The pictures in websites and the reality are match! You'll enjoy walking inside the garden. They manages the layout, design, and concept very well. It was so natural and tropical. The money is worth the awesomeness of this garden. I highly recommend it especially for family trips."
,,My favorite place,5.0,,One of the best place in Singapore. Very impressive. Very worthy . Definitely go there again . Many cool plants and flowers . Amazing .one of my favorite place.
,,Amazing why they can do these days,5.0,,"Absolutely loved our visit here apart from some of the walkways that you had to take to get back down that you could see through as I hate heights. Other than that, it was amazing inside with the massive waterfall and rainforest plants.

Take 30-60 minutes to go inside and take a break from the Singapore Humidity whilst you are in there."
,,Wow wow wow! A must see!,5.0,,"What a great experience this was - its unique and different. Feels like you are somewhere in a rain forest! NB!!! -Try and visit the times when they activate the mist, which will look like clouds hanging in this forest!"

,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,"My 13 yr old and I visited here during our time in Singapore- this was quite an impressive, peaceful and beautiful place to. Is it- it's definitely worth it."
,,Refreshing!!!,5.0,,"Another place to get recharged after walking under the hot Singapore sun. The temperature inside the dome is just perfect. There's nothing much to see other than the waterfalls and if you are not afraid of heights, you can walk in the walkway.

They also have a show about the effects of global warming so you can watch that if you are into that."
,,Incredible views and learning experience,5.0,,"This is an absolute must do in Singapore. Such a unique park. Incredible engineering feat in which the cloud elements (vapor and water) are part of a self-sustaining cycle. This is totally mad-made but ironically give you an experience of how nature works. At the end, there is an important PSA about climate change that is well-done and offers suggestions for what we can do to help."
,,A place of wonderment,5.0,,"The imagination and effort to create the Cloud Forest is simply staggering. Walking around the suspended walkway to see all the plant life, with the backdrop of the Singapore skyline is truly wonderful. For people with mobility problems, the top area can be accessed by lift."
,,A must visit during your visit to Singapore,5.0,,"A truly different and interesting tourist attraction, like a gigantic indoor vertical botanical garden, where you walk on gangways way up in the sky..."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"It's a surprisingly unique concept,Very refreshing concept.We used to seeing this for museums but applied it on Trees and executing it perfectly.Its overwhelming. indoor fountain and the walk down from the top in hanging bridge makes a adventurous experience.Dont leave Singapore without visiting Cloud forest."
,,incredible,5.0,,we went later in day as heard its hot outside with no shade - I was unsure if could do both in one afternoon - yes its doable we spent about and hour half in one - then walked across to Flower dome - the cloud forrest has the amazing waterfalls and everyone loves it. lovely and cool inside. walk around the super trees at sunset and do the walk way..for $8 is fantastic view.
,,How many different trees are there?,5.0,,"What an exciting exhibit this is as it has no many ""green plants"" displayed by the Country of origin it is mind boggling to see so many varieties in one exhibit"
,,A Place for Everyone,5.0,,From a 4 year old to a 70 year old everyone of our party of 13 thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our time in the Cloud Forest. Inspirational to see what can be done.
,,Nice view,4.0,,"A great place to beat the heat and enjoy the view. You can get great pictures from the top of and you work your way down exploring.

There is a video at the end you can watch that explains global warming and how it will affect us in the future.

Honestly, I enjoyed the botanical garden more than the Cloud Forest but I would recommend seeing both."
,,Lovely but nothing special for us,4.0,,Went with 7 yrs old daughter and although it was a lovely change of scenery (and air con helped!) it was not very impressive for us. I am sure a lot of people would love it but we preferred the flower Dome.
,,"HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS,WHICH IS MAN MADE",5.0,,"A marvel, for which kudos to the people behind conceptualising and executing it and more so for those who are maintaining it so immaculately. Cannot be missed."
,,"Scenic, good waterfall and great enjoyable cool relief",4.0,,"certainly worth a visit... love the waterfall, the great walk through interesting vegetation is nice - and the cool break inside is magic...
if looking for something fun, educational, interesting and enjoyable to do on a hot steamy day then go inside...
the carvings are amazing"
,,Cost but worth it.,4.0,,"A great experience to climb, walk and explore the various levels and climates. A very interesting way to explore such gardens."
,,A Great Break from the Heat,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is part of the Gardens by the Bay attraction and it provides a good relaxing break from the Singapore heat. Located within walking distance of the Marina Bay Sands this indoor waterfall and garden complex will run you about S$28 for adults and S$15 for kids with the price including admittance to the adjacent Flower Dome. ATA recommends reserving this outing for a lazy day or break day during your travels in Singapore. A visit here is a great break between a day of the Zoo and Night Safari and day of adventure in Sentosa.
,,Just amazing and beautiful,5.0,,It is amazing what has been done. The cloud forest highlights the importance of preserving our environment for our own well being. It is a must see while in Singapore.
,,PIECE OF PARADISE!,5.0,,"No words can explain the essence of this attraction. First, you'll take the elevators up then walk into a sky walk. I was shaking at first but it was worth while. From there, you'll go down back to prehistoric plants. It's like a walking museum of plant life and gives awareness to climate change. It is a must for Singapore tourist!"
,,Best Waterfall,5.0,,We did not expect this when we walked. The massive waterfall and then to walk up and around getting to experience everything at every level.
,,Wow!,5.0,,This is one of the two domes at Gardens by The Bay. It features a man made waterfall where we can go inside the mountain like structure . Each floor features unique climatic conditions and plants. There are walkways shooting to the sky through the waterfall which makes a magnificent scene at night.
,,Aussies enjoyed the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"We returned 3 times during our week stay in Singapore. Lovely to see in the morning, noon and night. Amazing display of plants, wood carvings and the welcoming waterfall as you enter the cloud dome:O) We enjoyed that you could stroll at your own pace and enjoy all the flowering plants colorers and various collection of plants. Cave experience, history of plant life and even the lego's. Loved the water feature at the top and every time we visited we discovered something new we missed on other trips, thanks to all, loved it and hope to return another time"
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,"We enjoy the food , flowers and the sky rise dome , the activist , the structure of the place and the people is very nice."
,,A great place to be!,4.0,,We took the lift to the top of the mountaintop to reach this unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forest. We enjoyed a stroll along the walkway to an aerial view of the canopy and mountainside below. The cost was reasonable for what it offers
,,"Tranquil, inspiring, educational, fun.",5.0,,Lovely and cool in there. You get a little wet. Do the path in the sky! Great view from up there. You really get to appreciate nature in here- Singapore is leading the way in environmental innovation.
,,Perfection,5.0,,"The range of plants and quality of art work when combined with a truly magical structure make the Cloud Forest a must visit location. Only when you enter the dome do you understand the scale of the display. Thousands of different plants hang from the structure and water falls from the top to ground level, This is a difficult place to describe but one that will linger in your memory for some time. The walkway provides great views of the bay and city. It also seems to 'hang' from the main core in a way that challenges your views on how structures support themselves. Take a leap of faith and just go there - it isn't a step you will regret."
,,One of an experience,4.0,,"If you are short of time...you can skip it.

But if you have time....the definitely worth visiting.

It is adjoining the flower dome.

It is a perfect example of modern science combining with nature in a small area, where temperatures and humidity is controlled.

Must watch"
,,Great place,5.0,,"Surprisingly cold in there, so bring a sweater. Nice place with educational display and waterfall. Walk platform in the ""sky"""
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This place sort of defies explanation. It is so very different. Lots of plants planted on a man made mountain. Under a dome. Must be seen.
,,Family Excursion to Cloud Forest,5.0,,It's an amazing experience for my entire family when we visited the Cloud Forest on a family outing. There were so many different species of flowers and plants that are so captivating to all of us. Flowers and plants are nice and fresh due to the cool temperature in the flower dome. Definitely worth paying a visit! Thumbs Up!
,,Nice but crowded,3.0,,"The attraction itself is quite interesting and unique. The waterfall is a nice touch and the plants are beautiful, I think they are the biggest attraction actually. The place is designed nicely - however, I went there twice and it was very crowded both time. Even on a weekday!"
,,Cool and green..,5.0,,"A must see for everyone visiting Singapore.. Huge waterfall, i think the biggest indoor, lots of plants from all over the world.. Do this and the flower dome.."
,,An extension of the gardens,5.0,,"Has to be seen to be believed this lovely tiered garden with waterfalls, so many beautiful plans, wonderful photo opportunities"
,,Nice job on creating a man made rainforest,4.0,,This was the structure that had the man made rain forest in it which provided a unique experience in a structure that could've been a parking garage.
,,Amazing and cool - respite from the heat!,5.0,,This place was SGD 28 for the cloud forest and flower dome. Very cool inside - you may want a light jacket. Views are amazing and so well done! Architecture was beautifully designed!
,,Part of our stay in Singapore,5.0,,We went to the Gardens by way of the Metro system which was very easy and very reasonable the Could Forest was amazing with so many varieties of plants
,,Absolutely Fabulous,5.0,,"If you don't see anything else you must visit the Cloud Forest Dome, it is a Must, Must see.
Our daughter, her husband and our Grand Daughter were with us, it was totally amazing and it hard to describe so I hope my photos help you understand."
,,A visit to Gardens By the Bay,4.0,,The gardens are very interesting and informative. You can understand the different kinds of plant grown around the world. You get the feel of the greenery and the different forestation being depicted. Good for your own general knowledge.
,,A wonderful place to visit,5.0,,My fiancé and I enjoyed our visit to the Cloud Forest. A fascinating place. So tranquil. We recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore!
,,Cool relief form the heat,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is an amazing place to visit, full of wonderful plants and a great waterfall, where you start from the top and wander down to the bottom again. It is also a very welcome relief from the heat outside the dome. Only problem is, you have to leave it sooner or later and return to the heat. If you love plants, this is a must see attraction."
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,Something we had never seen with my husband! A truly remarkable place in Singapore Worth a visit!! Perfect!
,,Interesting and unique,4.0,,"The garden is interesting with a waterfall and also the multiple levels that you go up to are windows to foliage. Amazing how this whole concept has been put together. What with a little hill, waterfall and dense and lush tropical plants and trees"
,,V. Cleverly Done,4.0,,"Finally, we made it inside on a wet Wednesday afternoon and happily managed to avoid the tourist crowds. After all, we had just paid to become Friends of Gardens at the Bay and were anxious to recoup some of our investment.

After entering the CF, the first thing one notices is the impressive artificial waterfall, built seven or eight storeys above the ground level. Everything was wreathed in appropriate vegetation all of which was clearly described in the signage. Take the lift up to the seventh floor and follow the tree top walkway, a little bit scary for those who don't relish heights. Again, clever, impressive and educational, but at the same time artificial and contrived. No birds or other wildlife of any kind, unlike in the real world, but that might be too difficult to incorporate.

On the way out, there is a very good exhibition designed to make one pause for thought on the subject of mankind's destruction of the environment. Then the gift shop and the exit.

I daresay we will be back one day, at least to see if any changes have been made to the display."
,,Parody gardens by the bay exoerience,5.0,,I loved the cloud forest. It was a cool temperature in the dome which was a welcome relief. The array of orchids was amazing. The attraction was well laid out and the walkways were cleverly thought out. A great educational experience
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,Enter the Cloud forest and take the lift to the top then be amazed by the climate changes and forestation and plants as you decend through this visual display of foliage and forest.
,,Well done. Reasonable value for money,4.0,,About $48 for 2 adults and 1 child. Good for 20 to 30 mind as you go to the top and wander all the way down. We went around 6.30pm then watched the light show in the gardens outside at 7.30 .
,,Very nice spot,5.0,,Very impressive location. The only place on earth so particular. Impressive waterfall and very nice scenes with flowers
,,Magical .. a must see,5.0,,Went there and was awestruck by Gardens By The Bay in particular the waterfall ... nothing prepares you for the wow factor walking in to be met by this massive indoor waterfall...highly recommended
,,Am I in Pandora?,5.0,,"Had a 8 hour layover in Singapore and made the choice to venture to the Gardens. Best decision ever! I recommend the cloud forest because it is something unlike you've ever seen before.

Only drawback are the crowds. We were there fairly early on a weekday and it was exhaustingly crowded with large groups of tourists but also families. The walkways are too tight for the traffic, and it makes it hard to read the information.

All in all though the experience is well worth 5 stars."
,,Even better than the Flower Dome!,5.0,,"We purchased a ""Friends of the Gardens"" yearly membership as, at the time of visiting, to celebrate it's 5th birthday, this card cost the same as it would've to visit the whole complex just once. This let us wander each of the ""domes"" on different days and allowed us go at a much more relaxed pace (we have 8, 5 and 3 yr olds).

If I had to choose, this is my preferred dome, simply for it's spectacular ""grandness"". The indoor waterfall is amazing and something I won't forget - like something from the future! Being able to walk up (or lift) and behind the waterfall to the ""Lost World"" at the top was pretty cool. There were so many species there that I'd spent a whole day trekking up Mt Kinabalu in Borneo to see, so it's certainly something to consider if wanting to avoid that trek! Out the back there's a ""skywalk"" that may not be for everyone's tastes, especially those with a fear of heights!

Our kids loved it (also probably more than the Flower Dome), my older two children loved the Venus Fly Traps and Pitcher plants."
,,Family with elderly parents,5.0,,"Beautiful surroundings showcasing flora and fauna found in various climates As there were no steps, this place is easily accessible and a breeze to wander around in. It can get a little chilly indoors so bring a light cardigan.

If you visit the Cloud Forest and have time to spare (at least an hour and a half more), head to the Flower Dome, which is just opposite and within a 2-min walk from the Cloud Forest. It is similar to the Cloud Forest in terms of atmosphere but features stunning flora which changes with the season. Highly recommended to check the 'Gardens by the Bay' official website for seasonal displays."
,,Great spot,4.0,,"Very interesting attraction , lots of beautiful flowers and plants. Couldn,t get the dual pass when we were there as orchid garden was closed for maintenance."
,,Amazing man-made indoor waterfall,4.0,,"I went with family and it was amazing. Once you enter, you will be stunned by the magnificent man-made indoor waterfall. That's the main attraction and tourists, don't forget to take pictures here.
After which, you have to take a lift to the top of the man-made peak of a ""mountain"" and walk down the slopes. You will enjoy the beauty of flowers, the height, the surrounding environment.
The height of the ""mountain"" also enables you to enjoy the great view of Singapore River, the Singapore Flyer (something like London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel), the CBD area of Singapore etc.)
Adults like this place very much but kids may find it a little boring. It depends."
,,Spectacular indoor forest,4.0,,I loved the statues scattered throughout the Cloud Forest displays and the indoor waterfall was spectacular. Highly recommended.
,,Honestly quite boring,3.0,,"If you are a tourist, you can skip this place. Visit to get respite from the heat. The bridge is quite fun though in terms of flowers, there isn't much."
,,beautiful setting,4.0,,Can walk in a rain forest setting. See a wide range of plants as if you are in the rainforest. Be prepared to bring a shawl or jacket. Its a bit chilly.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This place is amazing, it's part of the Gardens by the Bay development and you would be robbing yourself if you did not take the time to look through it."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,This is by far one of Asia's largest Cloud forest built within an environment with controlled temperature. Experience the diverse collections of plant species.
,,nice,5.0,,yes its a nice experience lots of greenry and acid stuff reccomend an early morning visit then you can witness and monkeys playing on the branches.
,,Amazing collection of different orchid species,4.0,,Excellent place for flower lovers and horticulturists with excellent floral arrangements and photography settings...
,,Must visit,5.0,,Definitely worth checking out. One of a kind. Also club it with the evening Super tree show. Do not spend too much time in the outside gardens.
,,"Fantastic setup, Tastefully done, Supreme effort, excellent maintenance",5.0,,"Several levels of plants, flowers, beautifully integrated. The organizers have taken pains to position plants appropriately, to keep the interest levels going all along. The man-made waterfall also has an exhilarating impact. Worth seeing. I've been to the place several times and wouldn't mind going again."
,,A man made nature,5.0,,"Must visit to know how important nature is . Lot to learn that enlightens us to preserve nature , forests ......."
,,Gardens by the bay.,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest never ceases to amaze me. Just imagine you are 2,500mtrs on the mountain slopes enjoying all the flora n fauna. Utterly satisfied with my visit there."
,,Very nice,5.0,,Possible the best in gardens by the bay. It has a large man made waterfall which has an amazing cooling effect.
,,Fresh Escape in the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"When it's raining or too hot and you don't know what to do, you can seek refuge in this amazing place where you can count to spend 2 hours. The atmosphere feels like we are in the middle of the junggle.
Had a great time :)"
,,Awe-inspiring and beautiful!,5.0,,Brought a guest from Canada who was super impressed by not just the beauty but the technological thought and sophistication. I was also happy to note that parts of the Gardens by the Bay were open to the public free of charge.
,,Don't leave this until late in the day.,4.0,,"A magical wonderland that needs to be experiences by the not too tired traveler. Go earlier in the day so as to enjoy the walk and experience before your feet start yelling at you, It is just gorgeous for all ages."
,,Beautiful man-made/natural attraction,4.0,,A wonderful cascading waterfall within a man made structure overflowing with exotic plants. Very well presented and wonderfully organised. The information is subtle for those seeking more knowledge but simply take it all in as you venture around. Don't feel the need to rush
,,Nice indoor attraction,5.0,,We really enjoyed climbing up inside the Cloud Forrest. Great picture taking from behind the waterfall.
,,Impressive indoor mountain,4.0,,First time in the Cloud Forest last week after collecting my annual membership at the Friends of the Garden office. Being a weekday lunchtime it wasn't too busy and so it was easy enough to explore the full path without being too badly disturbed by other visitors. I imagine that this place must get insanely busy on weekends though. A most impressive feat of engineering to create this huge dome and then the simulated forest mountain in the middle. Certainly worth a visit.
,,Wow!,5.0,,We brought tickets for the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome and were not disappointed. As we arrived late (after 6.30pm) we visited the Flower Dome then went to watch the light show before visiting the Cloud Forest. Inside there are water falls and so much to see. Going in after 8pm gave the dome a lovely atmosphere and a great view of Singapore night skyline which was very pretty. Going up to the top of Cloud Mountain was worth it and certainly worth a visit. The misting at regular intervals was most welcome after the humidity outside.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Favorite place to see in Singapore! It was also nice and cool because the plants thrived in a cooler environment than the hot outside area. Many cool plants.
,,Overrated,2.0,,"So overrated and busy. I was expecting much more, would be enjoyable to walk around and peaceful if it was empty. However it was so busy we had to queue the whole way round and made it not a pleasant experience."
,,Nice Experience...,5.0,,"this is a must visit dome when in Garden by the Bay, its amazing how they cleverly manage to create this park - the man made water falls, hill/mountain and a small lust forest in a small place..."
,,Magnificent Design,5.0,,"Its really amaze us when we saw beautiful waterfall inside the dome and also there's a mist garden at the top. Tips : Observe the Dome from the Top to the Bottom, you can access via Elevator to the Top"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Cloud Forest was amazing and beautiful. Definitely worth adding to your itinerary. Anyone with issues with heights might prefer to take the internal stairs or use the lift. Spectacular views.
,,So worth the extra charge!,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing dome. Words fail me as its like nothing I have seen before. As soon as you walk in the door of the dome, you are confronted with 35 metre high waterfall. Then there is a walkway that slowly spirals its way around the dome to the top. Along the way, you see plenty of flowers in a tropical setting.,"
,,A must see,5.0,,"Easily one of the best days out in Singapore. Not to be missed. This is a perfect spot for both single travellers, couples, friends and families - something for everyone!"
,,A must visit,4.0,,I was fully expecting to be bored as plants aren't really my thing but this display was breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Absolutely amazing! Enter and you will agree with me!,5.0,,"It is a huge place, with multiples species of plants in an incredible construction! It is a big greenhouse, but with so much space that you don't feel it. When you enter the place you will get amazed by the amazing waterfall that is very high. You get an elevator to the top floor and start your descending through and skywalk, seeing the beautiful plants next to you. Love it!"
,,My favourite part of the gardens,5.0,,"As the title suggests, this was my favourite part to the whole gardens. Very enjoyable wandering around these gardens and soaking in the environment around us. Very well maintained as well."
,,Amazing Vertical Garden,5.0,,"Its a wonderful man made vertical garden. The water fall is really amazing.

I would rate this any day better than the other dome and if you have time to just see one dome this one is a must see.

The water fall, the spiral walk down from the top , with all the beautiful flowers and nature and waterfall noise takes you in another world. Also don't miss the water misting which happens many times.

Do spend a good 2-3 hours seeing this dome."
,,"Amazing, just amazing",5.0,,If you go to the Garden on the Bay it's worth paying the entrance to visit the Cloud Forest. Very inspiring and surprising.
,,Just beautiful!,5.0,,This was totally worth the money. A breathtaking walk through the cloud forest taking in all the views of the city.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Best part of the gardens for us with the massive inside waterfall and the abundance and variety of flora and fauna. An easy walkway takes you around so you can see everything. You may wish to bring a light jacket as it was pretty chilly in there coming in from the outside heat.
Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
,,Simply Fabulous,5.0,,"I spent a couple of hours wandering around the dome taking it all in, loved it all. As you enter take note of the times of the water misting which occurs several times throughout the day. I missed one by a few minutes not realising they occurred so got a stamp as I exited so I could return later in the day to catch one. Adds an extra element to the ambiance. Saw things on my second time round that I had missed the first time. The waterfall and variety of orchids were the standouts for me along with the spiral walkway which makes you feel like you are looking out to another world as you slowly descend circling inside the dome. Very different to the Flower Dome."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,I visited the gardens by the bay and the cloud forest I liked the cloud forest better unless you love to see exotic plants the cloud forest has almost a real feel to it the water fall is beautiful
,,SINGADVENTURES,5.0,,"A must see,beautiful,unique man made falls and garden.A great experience and good to visit specially this summer."
,,Spectacular vertical gardens,5.0,,The Cloud Forest has the world's largest indoor waterfall. The vertical gardens are lush and the variety of plants spectacular.
,,Fascinating climb with waterfalls and vegetation,4.0,,"Fascinating climb through waterfalls and vegetation. Crowded, overwhelming crowded, pushy people all of which destroy the context of the botanic garden."
,,Don't miss this! Don't,5.0,,"I was there in the afternoon and don't have much time. So I only bought a ticket for one dome and gladly I choose this one ( will try the other next time).

Even if you're not a garden person, you'll still love this place. The garden is so well designed, The lighting is perfect and you can almost always be able to take pictures with the adjacent marina bay from the walkway withing this could forest."
,,Very nice place,5.0,,Awesome place to visit. Very nicely maintained. very scenic. Lots of rare plants. Good experience. Worth visit

,,Beautiful - a must see sight in Singapore,5.0,,"You just have to go here, it is beautiful to walk around, lots of stunning plants/flowers to see, and sculptures too. You go high up and walk on platforms out, almost like treetop walk style, so you can see the plants/flowers from different views and angles. You'll get some great photographs here. Also, it is air-conditioned, a great bonus, a reprieve from the Singapore humidity for a few hours. The admission fee is good value, really, don't miss this place."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a man made wonder.Its a huge done with an artificial waterfall ,clouds and beautiful plants.It is a multistorey place with a. Platform leading you to the lost world with so many beautiful plants and rare flowers and carnivorous plants like the pitcher plant and Venus flytrap.We we're awed by the display."

,,Be prepared,5.0,,"This is a fantastic place to see in Singapore. The most surprising feature is that it is actually very cool inside.
I expected a tropical climate like outside but its rather like in the mountains.
The View from the different walkeays from top to down is great and the different gardens are beautiful to watch.
A must see !"
,,Not as good as the Flower Dome,4.0,,This Dome is pretty but not as interesting as the Flower Dome. It's quite wet in the Cloud Forrest so make sure to protect your cameras. The video presentation at the end is very interesting because it makes you very aware of our current problems in the world.
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest at Gardens in the Bay is a simply stunning man made mountain/waterfall that is around 8 stories high and located in a domed, air conditioned building. I have not experienced anything like it anywhere else in the world and it is well worth the visit"

,,Wow. What a great summary of Singapore's horticulture.,5.0,,"It's all there. You could spend a lifetime wandering forests, parks and gardens or visit this magic place and wander through the most amazing explosions of colour and natural beauty. We were blow away by the imaginative displays that enhanced our ease of viewing and the presentation of the plants. Clean, cool and safe. A great way to see and do. Congratulations Singapore."
,,Incredible,5.0,,Absolutley astounding. Loved walking through this exhibition. Really does give you the feeling of walking in a rainforest.
,,A must for your visit,5.0,,"If you like beauty this is it, leave yourself at least 5-6 hours and do gardens by the bay and start at the flower dome which is beautiful but for me gets blown away by this you will come out thinking that was nice but get ready to be blown away as you enter something really out of this world, Make sure you take some form of capturing the beauty because if your from out of Singapore your never going to see anything else like this."
,,Absolutely fantastic!,5.0,,"I took my teenage daughter, who is very interested in science, to see this facility. Her reaction was priceless & told me that I had made the right choice in bringing her to view this stunning display.

The facility, as seems to be the trend in Singapore, is devoted in large part to reminding us of the fragility of our planet.

The visitor is greeted by the tallest indoor waterfall I've ever seen, and the displays continue to impress throughout the duration of the visit.

The setup is quite ingenious - an elevator takes the visitor to the top, and during. Gentle walk down to the base many different types of fauna are displayed, along with explanations of their origins and world locales where they are found.

At the end of the visit, there is a very informative, and sobering, film about climate change and the impacts humans are having on the planet in the 21st century. It is a reminder that we use all do our part to protect our home and be good global citizens.

Five stars for the beauty of the facility, and five plus stars for the educational value of these exhibits and the effort made by the staff to help people understand and the fragility of this rock hurtling through space known as Earth."
,,You will not believe your eyes,5.0,,"Immense, from one ""ooooh"" to another....the wonderment never stops. This place will spoil you for any other display/bio-dome - so well executed and designed."
,,Impressive but long queues,4.0,,"This us one of the large green houses at the Gardens By The Bay. Contains man made waterfall and rain forest. You can go up the inside if the waterfall and walk on a skywalk above, but the queue was lengthy (on a Sunday)"

,,Absolutely spectacular!,5.0,,"Started the day wandering the Gardens by the Bay but was pleasantly relieved when we stepped into the coolness of the Cloud Forest Conservatory. Immediately under the cool spray of the waterfall and amazed by the audacity of the place. Elevator up to the seventh level to start the slow walk down over the suspended cat walks. Amazing flora, carvings and layout. An absolute must do when in Singapore. Money well spent."

,,Very nice,5.0,,Beautiful indoor garden.. Never seen anything like this. Nice artificial waterfall. Nice sculptures n plants
,,Cloud Forest will make you feel in the clouds,5.0,,This is a really spectacular feature of the Gardens by the Bay. You get cooled off as you enter with the high waterfall at the entrance and they wind you way around the beautiful flower exhibits. Going all the way to the top and walking back down gets you the real feel of descending from the clouds in a magical forest. The exhibits are really well done and very beautiful to see. An excellent exhibit and makes you want to preserve our climate.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Amazing experience. also informative regarding the effect of climate change on cloud forests. worth a visit
,,Very unique showcasing nature!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a unique experience that takes you to various levels of nature. It houses the highest indoor waterfall in the world. The layout is excellent, as you take an elevator to the top and work your way down. It can be a bit cold, thus you might wish to bring a light jacket. I highly recommend visiting this attraction."
,,Fav attraction in Singapore,5.0,,This was a highlight of my vacation - the design and concept is totally unexpected and even if you don't like garderns I think you will enjoy.
,,Nature at it's best,4.0,,"The moment u enter .. u see a waterfall and can't stop yourself from taking a lil shower. From there on the beauty just gets better and better . You would love seeing the fellow tourists walking on the higher track ahead of you and walk-way and railing is just awesome. If you are someone who loves nature, must go and visit once."
,,A must visit.,5.0,,All of that man made rain forest setting inside a glasshouse is mind blowing. A great walkaround inside and abit more exciting than the flower dome(I'm to young to enjoy flowers yet).The waterfall is definitely the highlight and the tower that holds it.
,,Unique and very interesting,5.0,,"You can definitely bring your camera to capture the moments, but just taking in everything as is, especially from on top is really special. It gets a bit cold so if it's too much for you bring a jacket or shawl. A few educational stops on the way down. All worth seeing!"
,,A bit artificial,3.0,,"When you love nature like we do, this place would seem like a must visit. It disappointed a bit, way too artificial."

,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Loved it, would come again and again. Never bored of the plants on display. Amazing how everything is maintained so well, green and beautiful. Colourful and awesome."
,,Interesting place,5.0,,A must visit place specially for school students as the place is very informative on flora and fauna found in tropical forests.
,,Excellent,5.0,,A truly amazing experience although the highest walks were too much for me as a vertigo sufferer--we would highly recommend this attraction
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,The cloud forest is part of the Garden's by the bay attraction. It is truly a unique experience. Children will love it.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A must see for everyone, most amazing indoor spectacular. A head for heights is a must for the aerial walkways which are breathtaking."
,,Wow...Breathtaking view,4.0,,"Though it is not natural, you won't see that it is artificial either. It feels like you entered into an extraterrestrial land. Very cold inside. About 4 stories and you can experience different zones in them."
,,Slippery When Wet,4.0,,"Be careful when you walk inside as the water spray from the indoor falls and the plant water sprinkler always make the floors slippery . Many kinds of plants can be seen here , which simulates a rainforest . There are lifts , a cloud walkway , a cavern etc ."
,,pricey but worth going once,5.0,,"totally worth going once, it is quite interesting to see man-made waterfalls and the place is just so serene and chill inside."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Wow! This is a must visit whilst in Singapore. The indoor depiction of an equatorial cloud forest is amazing. Not only is there a large waterfall but an extensive range of vegetation and climate zones. It's also a good spot to take refuge from the humidity.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Must place to visit... Really Amazing. Hats off to the guy who has designed this. From the time you enter to the time you are out, you are really mesmerised...Best part of Gardens by the bay..."
,,Unique and amazing,5.0,,To my knowledge it is the only one of its kind. Entering the dome is so impressive as you will be facing a water fall coming from the top lf the mountain. Then you nicely walk your way up ( elevator available if needed). The beauty of the nature and flowers is breath taking. So many suprises which I do not want to spoil. Just be ready it is freezing in there so take a jacket and enjoy!!
,,MUST in SG,5.0,,Please don't miss the Gardens by the bay cloud forest while visiting SG. One of its kind experience. Technology meets nature. Refer my other review for GBB
,,Part of the Gardens by Bay: Cloud Forest is 2nd favorite part,5.0,,"Pros: Love the info , the cool mist, the high vantage point , and the space (less constricted I think than the flower dome) Cons: The Elevators can get stressful especially with lots of visitors"
,,Wondrous !,5.0,,"Being a part of the Gardens by the Bay, Cloud forest with its multi level fauna and the indoor waterfall is one of its own kind that makes it a must visit place in Singapore. A surreal experience !"
,,Stunning!!,5.0,,It's a must visit when in Singapore. It has a lovely waterfalls. The kids will definitely enjoy the experience.
,,Superbly created rainforst environment,5.0,,"Brilliant activity - This is one of the feature activities at the Gardens by the Bay precinct. Its inside a beautiful glass greenhouse style structure and offers a multilevel walkway with mass plantings of rain forest plants, shrubs etc. It has waterfalls and optional internal elevator for those not comfortable with the walkway spiral descent or those with mobility or vertigo issues.
There are several sessions daily where the mist level is activated / increased ( hence where the name Cloud comes from) along with the ever present waterfalls. The glass structure regulates the temperature ( it was much cooler and more comfortable than outside in the open gardens) - Found it an excellent way to view the rain forest environment and marvel at the vertical gardens and waterfalls. Also offers a great view externally of the gardens and Marina Bay Sands hotel and surrounds.
Well worth the visit and best done in conjunction with the Flower Dome which is completely different again. Highly enjoyable and recommended and you can do it at your own pace."
,,Man made attraction,3.0,,"The place is nice to visit with the family, it is a man made attraction for tourist. They recreated a different habitat inside Singapore but purely a place for tourist."
,,Definitely have a look,5.0,,We had a great time checking out the cloud forest.nice and cool inside. Value for money. Was busy but plenty of room. Beautiful plants and flowers. Spent about 1.5 hours inside
,,Crowded,3.0,,It can be a cool respite from the heat and the bridge is fun to walk on but it's no fun when crowded and people are taking selfies left and right!
,,A 'must visit' !!,5.0,,What a cleaver attraction with a magnificent waterfall right in the middle of it!! Allow plenty of time to visit this site and make sure that you stay after dark for the light show.
,,Nice,4.0,,Has a lovely waterfall and lot of trees. Good to visit. Gives a rainforesty feeling. Worth checking out.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We paid S$28pp to visit both greenhouses. I would recommend that you see inside both of them, as they are completely different. It's a fine place to walk around for an hour or so. Lots of thought and work has gone into the creation of the Cloud forest and it is a must see place. We saw the greenhouses in late afternoon followed by the free lightshow at dusk."
,,Must visit,5.0,,One of the best places to visit in Singapore.. it had a cool environment.. it's just a place u never want to miss out on.
,,Cool and interesting,5.0,,Photo shot at waterfall worth the cost of entry. Catch lift up to 6th floor and then walk down through different levels with plants and carvings

,,Truly amazing,5.0,,"You must do this! Well organised and informative, superb ecosystem in a dome, a must see in Singapore. We were not able to afford to see both domes on this trip so hopefully we will see the flower dome next trip

,,Not to be missed,5.0,,Spent nearly 3 hours in this incredible dome - sky walk through dome was incredible - air conditioned so very pleasant.
,,Cloud Forest - A Human Creation,5.0,,"Gardens By The Bay (Cloud Forest)

Well…. What do I say for this man made creation; honestly words would fall short to explain this creation. Have also attached some photographs which I have taken during my visit, correlate with my review.
Right from the entrance, the place has been beautifully designed….. you will find some beautiful rock creations. One thing that I liked the most about these rock creations was the huge flat rocks which were polished and kept along the path for the visitors to sit (I hope so).

Once you enter the Cloud Forest, there is a magnificent water fall from a high mountain like structure. The atmosphere is like as if you are 1000 fts above on a mountain covered by clouds and due. It’s just mesmerizing on first contact. Then there are knowledge boards which explain the concept of the cloud forest for a novice like me. They have around seven levels for the visitors to experience (you can travel by walk or elevators). Entire creation is on a mountain like structure in an environment which is artificially controlled to give you the feeling of being present on a cloud forest. This controlled climate also seems to be the ideal climate for the flora which has been brought from across the world.

As you start your ascend to the mountain, one comes across some beautiful plants and flowers. Some of these are absolutely rare or you cannot get to see them anywhere in the world except their original natural habitat. I personally was amazed to see the Carnivorous Plants section. I have read about them, seen them in cartoons or documentaries and even taught about them to my teenage kids but never had an opportunity to see them in person. They turned out to be pretty small than I expected; not more than one to two inches in length and beautiful looking. I wish I had an opportunity to see some insects getting into their trap.

Once you get down, on the lowest level, you find some of the smallest plants and flowers in their Miniature Orchids for which one needs magnifying glasses which they have already installed for the experience. The culminating point of the Cloud Forest is a 5 minutes movie named “+5 Degrees” that educates you about the changes that the earth has seen and will see in the future. It is primarily a warning to we human who are exploiting it to an extent that it will end up destroying us and our very existence.

Once the evening sets in and it’s sufficiently dark, the entrance of the Gardens by the Bay gets to see a gathering of crowd waiting for some show…. As the slow starts, the dark tall artificial trees start getting converted to beautiful structures which are eliminated by lights. This the Light & Sound Show for almost 30 minutes which again does not fil to mesmerizes you into it. I get a little surprised when I see people getting busy recording the show and forget to enjoy the actual effect.

The complex also houses a huge souvenir shop which offers the visitors with a wide range of memorabilia and books to select from.

Gardens by the Bay is a must visit once you are in Singapore and if you are a nature lover. I had spent so much time in the Cloud Forest that I could not visit the other creation the Flower Dome…… may be destiny has kept it for my during my next visit."
,,Best of the two domes in the park,4.0,,The cloud forest tour is great and better than the flower dome next to it. Very cool design and because it only has one way to walk through it it's very easy to do and people move efficiently through the dome.
,,nice spots,5.0,,I like the attractions☺️ recommended for the families☺️👌🏻Specially those with kids must go and try the attractions.
,,Nice,4.0,,"Though i did not quite understand what cloud forest meant, i loved the experience of walking through it."
,,You will have a great time.. if your not scared of heights :-/,5.0,,Sensational place to visit and great views of singapores iconic landmarks.. not for the faint hearted or people who suffer acrophobia :-/
,,Unbelievable experience,5.0,,"I am not sure where else in the world you will see something as beautiful as this experience. I went early in the morning to avoid the crowds and was able to really take in the sights, sounds, and beauty that is the cloud forest. I did forego the other aspects of the remainder of the other attractions, but I would do this over again and explore other sites in the area in the future."
,,Nature indoors,5.0,,"This magnificent building showcases a huge array of plant species, with waterfalls and cloud mists all around."
,,A different world inside,5.0,,"Between the two domes in Gardens by the Bay, this has to be my favourite. You are welcomed by a beautiful waterfall the moment you step into it. If you look down the waterfall you will also spot a rainbow. Head to the top before taking a slow walk down. It's easy to enjoy the beauty of Cloud Forest."
,,Awesome but crowded,4.0,,There may be other places like this but we've not encountered them. An enclosed tropical mountain rain forest. Probably best visited in morning because gets very crowed as day progresses
,,Really impressive,5.0,,Great architecture and very neat design with the internal walkways. Nice cool environment and spectacular planting make this a pleasant and beautiful place to be. Involves a reasonable amount of walking but well worth following the walkways all the way down. Probably the most interesting and spectacular part of the gardens.
,,The better conservatory of the two,5.0,,Both conservatories at the Gardens are amazing but this one is by far the better of the two. Definitely worth a visit!
,,Wow,5.0,,A extremely beautiful place to visit... A must must. I really appreciate the way it's managed. It's very spacious beautiful lovely place to visit
,,Even teenage boys loved it!,5.0,,"My second visit, bringing my family this time. Even my teenage boys were blown away by the beauty of this exhibit .... we loved it, and spent a .ot of time exploring the different areas. Highly recommended,"
,,Part of the garden complex !,5.0,,"Nice to walk around inside this as it is a bit cooler and breathtaking, very well done ! There is a considerable temperature drop towards the top of the building, very refreshing !"
,,A Walk in the Clouds !,5.0,,"You miss it and you would have missed an amazing experience.Need to acknowledge the efforts gone into making of this spectacular Man made natural Forest.Be here at the right moment to experience what it means to be ""walking in the clouds"", The Dome consists of one of the highest man made waterfall. One can make use of a lift to reach the top most level of the Dome/waterfall and then walk down enjoying the fantastic view below.Visit to this attraction can be clubbed with Flower Dome and Super Tree Grove. However plan to reach the top of the waterfall or at least be in the halfway of the walkway when water is sprayed to create an artificially mist / fog around the waterfall. The mist is created once in every 2 hours and the timings of the same is displayed just outside the entrance."
,,Be Down on the Ground and Up in the Sky,5.0,,"This amazing artificial climate, Cloud Forest, replicates the conditions of tropical mountain regions ranging from one thousand meters to three thousand meters above sea level. In addition to the wonderful bio-diversity ambiance, one takes a lift up the Cloud Mountain, which is clad in orchids, bromeliads and ferns. It is highlighted with beautiful anthuriums and full of greenery. One descends Cloud Mountain down a circular path on a gentle ramp with a water fall gifting refreshing cool air!"
,,UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC,5.0,,This is such an unbelievable fantastic man-made attraction! You'll never experience such place (unless you go hiking steep mountains) because here you can see different types of plants and flowers that can only survive in mountainous regions. Highly recommended place!
,,Wow,5.0,,The cloud forest dome is the larger of the two domes and has an impressive waterfall in the centre. You walk from the top down along walkways that extend out from the central waterfall affording amazing views. It is the warmer of the two domes also so you will be comfortable. A surprise grotto at the end caps the visit. There are many places to buy tickets.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Must see. Make sure you see the mist in the cloud room. The whole place has mist/fog in the garden dome and is spectacular.
,,Never miss this,5.0,,"According to me the #1 destination point in Singapore is Cloud Forest.
Stunning, pain stakingly executed this is a love's labour. Gives an experience of living in the hills. The climate in the hills have been executed to thrill us.
The beauty of the plants have to be seen to be believed.
Will return to see this again and again"
,,Such an amazing place,5.0,,There was so much thing to see at the Cloud Forest. We were impressed by its beauty. The price might be a bit expensive but it was worth. We also really enjoyed walking around this place. Highly recommend it!

,,A rare experience,5.0,,"Part of the most exquisite indoor garden, the Garden by the Bay, The cloud forest is unique in its design, preservation and maintenance. It is a must see along with the Garden by the Bay."
,,Awesome,5.0,,The waterfall is amazing. We went at night but will return to Singapore to see in the daytime as will be totally different atmosphere. Some of the trees look like they have been there for centuries
,,Love this place!,5.0,,2nd visit here (went in April as well) and it still made me feel like I had escaped the hustle and bustle of Singapore! Loads of new things to see. Makes the Eden Project in Cornwall look silly. Definitely recommend this and the Flower Dome. Also time your visit in late afternoon and you can see the Gardens by the Bay light and sound show!
,,Kids love it!,5.0,,Be sure not to miss cloud forest when visiting Gardens by the bay! But bring a sweater because it's cold inside and it takes a while to walk through. It's both fascinating and educational and works well for both kids and adults.
,,Average attraction,3.0,,Not sure what exactly is the attraction except for the waterfall .. the whole place is pretty cooling though
,,Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"Cloud forest is just one area of this expansive Gardens by the Bay. It's awesome. All put together on reclaimed areas of Singapore. It's now becoming really established & we love the place. Spend an entire day there, relax at a restaurant for lunch too. Another amazing piece of Singapore. We love this city!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This dome is incredible! You feel like you're in the depths of a rainforest and there is so much to see on your way around. The set up is clever and clean and the view from the top is amazing!
,,Wonderful Place,5.0,,"The weather in singapore is hot, but the temperature is the house is so cool, people will feel relax here. There are many levels for many different kinds of vegetation, a good place to learn a lesson too"

,,Must ser,5.0,,Singapore is very hot so the Cloud Forest is a wonderful attraction to visit anytime of the day as it is very cool in the Cloud Forest. Great to see so many different varieties of flowers and also the largest man made waterfall.
,,Magical and beautiful place! Must visit while you are in Singapore,5.0,,This place was amazing and for me the best in Singapore! If you are staying in Singapore make sure you're gonna visit this place.
,,Well Worth It,5.0,,"A beautiful trip up a tropical ""mountain"" inside a indoor conservatory. It's a good break from the heat and well worth the money."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"My humble opinion about Singapore: You don't have it, you make it.
Cloud Forest is a well organised, massive, neat and tidy rainforest in one building. With controlled temperature and air ventilation, you will never sweat exploring this 'jungle'. If you are nature lover, you may think this is so fake. A fake water fall??
Please visit this place, and see the dedication of Singaporeans doing great things, wholeheartedly. You will be more than impress."
,,I'm not sure how you can rate this any lower than excellent..,5.0,,"Absoutey worth the trip. Was the highlight of our trip to Singapore. We had recommendations from everyone we know who has been to visit and they were right!
The view from the top is phenomenal and they have gone to huge extents to make sure it is a full experience.. There are various levels on the way down, an infinity pool, you can stand under the waterfall and on the ground level they go through the effect temperature change is having on plants and the natural world which I think is very important. Having seen all these beautiful plants, it really hit home to be shown how we are preventing their future. Family friendly !"
,,Inside waterfall,4.0,,The cloud forest was huge and a welcome relief from the outside heat. Multi levels wind their way around the waterfall with lots of varieties of rain forest plants. The display made completely of lego was fantastic.
,,If you don't go you never were in Singapore,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest (and the Flower Dome) was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore. I was wowed by the attention to detail of this place, it's really a great place to be. Everything from the cactus exhibit (at the Flower Dome) to the end movie at the Cloud Forest was top notches!"
,,A must do Singapore,5.0,,"You walk out of the heat and humidity of singapore into a cool rain forest, with a high waterfall cascading through the centre.
This really is a must do, young kids, teenagers, romantic young (or old) couples, groups of friends, everyone would be impressed with the cloud forest.
A great idea is that you start by taking an elevator straight to the top , then slowly, casually walk down- so much easier than gradually walking up, just one of the very many touches that make this a great place to visit."
,,Mesmerising Indoor rainforest,5.0,,"It is part of Garden by the bay but you need to buy a ticket. Amazing waterfall at the entry, feels so natural and not man made at all. Its a multi-level indoor forest with such diverse flora. Perfect for an evening walk around 6-7pm. Do check out the misting timings as well. Must visit place."
,,Up above the Waterfall,4.0,,The cloud Forest is the second dome beside the Floral dome. I enjoyed walking around the top sky walk and viewing various different plants and flowers and the cascading flower displays and waterfall. The tall crystal pieces are of interest. Both domes can be visited at the same time.
,,Indoor waterfall,4.0,,"I like that SG has pockets of green around the city, as well as educational experiences like Cloud Forest where you can even see an indoor waterfall. This being SG, the entrance ticket wasn't cheap. But it was interesting to be in a forest setting but with the convenience of being indoors (i.e., AC)."
,,The best thing about the gardens,5.0,,"This spectacular forest tower is really the highlight of the Gardens by the Bay. With waterfalls and different attractions on each level it transports you to another world.

If going to do both this and the Flower Dome do the done first otherwise it won't seem as spectacular after you do the Cloud Forest!"
,,Clear View in Cloud Forest,5.0,,The admission price is well worth it. It is a spectacular display. The variety of plants and the construction of the mountain to show them off with the huge indoor waterfall can not be missed.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"You forget that you are in the middle of a city stepping into this forest. You keep looking around and you think to your self how great is it. It really does take you to another place. It is also very educational, as it tells you a great deal of history about the plants and the exhibitions around. Also it does warn us about what will happen if global warming continues. A must see."
,,Transported to another world,5.0,,"If there is one thing to see in Singapore this is it. Cloud Forest is a definite must see attraction whilst in Singapore. Being inside a huge dome and climate controlled, your time spent within offers great respite from the humidity.

One of the most amazing ""gardens"" I have ever seen - worth the trip to Singapore just to visit the Cloud Forest. A definite 10 out of 10 from me, the beauty of this site left me breathless. I would recommend allocating at least one hour for your visit."
,,ANOTHER WORLD,5.0,,"Magical experience, the greenery- the flowers... we had a competition (me & grandaughter.. our iPhones- 6 plus vs 7 plus...) photographing the beautiful blooms... the heights, the sensations and the outstanding wood carvings throughout... sensational."
,,Brilliant experience - best at night!,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, intriguing sculptures and spectacular, misty views. Most enjoyable and nice and cool!"
,,Cool retreat,4.0,,"A cool experience after walking around the rest of Gardens By the Bay. Lots of plants and exhibitions to see,"
,,My number 1 in Singapore,5.0,,"If I could only visit one place in Singapore, this would be it! I fell in love with this place and ended up spending many hours here trying to take it all in!"
,,A breathtaking view,5.0,,"The place is well maintained and here you can see the need of vertical gardening. Whole building is air conditioned to maintain the flora and fauna specific information on each country wise gardens. Place is very much picturesque. Offers breathtaking views and also you can learn about each plants and flowers.

A must visit place."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,So glad to have seen this kind of man-made forest! A beautiful creation and nicely maintained. So exciting as you go up and down the walkway.
,,One of the best man made tourist attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"This is my must see whenever people are in town. a fun, informative, walk through interesting forest climates"
,,A world in itself,5.0,,"The artificially created indoor garden and waterfall are excellent . It is like being transported into another world, so pure, calm and serene"
,,must see,5.0,,we did the cloud dome after seeing the garden dome and we thought it was very good. You can walk around taking your time enjoying the sights and make a day out of it
,,Simply Superb,5.0,,"When we stepped into it, all the disappointment after seeing the flower dome vanished. The main attraction i.e the waterfall was simply amazing and when the mist came, the whole dome was breathtaking."
,,Amazing to be in there,5.0,,"Well worth the money. Get both tickets for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome online for a cheaper price.
The second you step into the entrance of the Cloud Forest, you are welcomed by this gorgeous waterfall that just takes your breath away. The air inside is so fresh as you are surrounded by trees and flowers. Follow the path and it will lead you around the ""mountain"" in the center then to an elevator area where you can take it up to the top and walk down via two sky bridge hanging around the ""mountain"". Be warned that if you are scared of heights then the sky bridge might not be your thing as you can see what is below you via the walking path. As someone who is scared of heights it was really terrifying for me but the experience was amazing overall!"
,,Incredible gardens!,5.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. When I saw the ticket price I was a bit worried because I was on a budget, but I'm so glad I went ahead. It's absolutely stunning."
,,Amazing scale and experience,5.0,,go early to avoid the crowds. also watch the paths they can be slippery. use shuttle bus from MRT station.
,,Fantastic Concept,5.0,,"A great experience filled with delightful sights, sounds and scents. Walking through the intense cool atmosphere was very enjoyable."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was one of the few ""touristy things"" i did in Singapore but it was so lovely, and they have a good video at the end which shows what is happening to the planet."
,,amazing!!,5.0,,"is one of the more marvellous places I've visited. The perfect combination between design and nature, is really valuable spend the time there,"
,,Pleasant water fall,3.0,,"If you are here for super tree sound n light show which was awesome and you have extra time in the evening before that then it's a good short visit along with flower dome
1st sight of water fall is pleasant
Lot of green trees , plants , flowers in spiral up
Can give it a miss"
,,Great spot worth a visit.,4.0,,Visited here with friend Sunday afternoon busy but comfortable. Really lovely spot with indoor waterfall. You are sent by elevator up to where you exit out onto a walkway that takes you high up into the cloud forest. Really well done and great views of Singapore as well. When desending you do part by escalator and exit onto another floor now you could easily miss out on part of the tour here as there is an adjoining walkway and unless you look for it you could easily miss it and continue on your descent. Also there is an interesting video on climate change in an area where the projection is on the floor and walls and again we were lucky to pass at the right time to view it otherwise we would have missed it. I mentioned to my friend that there could have been either music or sounds of birds or monkeys to add to the atmosphere and as it happens there is as you walk out the exit door. Pity. Overall good experience and recommended but staff could be more involved with public.
,,Excellent visitor attraction,5.0,,"The cloud forest is well worth visiting, the indoor waterfall and viewing platform and walkways are amazing (not for anyone who doesn't like heights though)."
,,Spectacular exhibit,5.0,,"If you're at Gardens by the bay in the cloud forest is a must, unless of course you suffer vertigo even then it's worth giving it a try. Set aside a good 45 minutes to do the job properly and don't forget to watch the movie downstairs about projections on the environment. Also check out the 3-D model and interactive projection on how the entire park is eco-friendly very interesting."
,,Jungle in the city,5.0,,"The concept of cloud forest is amazing. The main structure inside the dome has 6 floors. Once you reach the sixth floor, you can walk all the way down along the big forest strucutre. The view is just mesmerizing."
,,Great,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest was nice to walk around. Lots to look at. Waterfall at the beginning was impressive. Try to be in the dome when they turn the mist on, which is every couple of hours."
,,Great way to experience the world's plants in one place,5.0,,"This was by far one of the most beautiful biospheres/public spaces I have been to. The plant life, amazing waterfall and educational experience about our natural world was definitely worth the price of admission. Take the time to read all the info cubes and watch the video on climate change at the end...it really puts things into perspective about the state of our world."
,,So many different plants - definitely see!,4.0,,"I wasn't there for the 'cloud' which happens (I think) every hour, but it was a lovely walk around. Also aircon'd so that helps when it's super hot. The only thing that it lacks in, is the educational video at the end doesn't show the impact of climate change enough.. but definitely a must-see when going to Gardens by the Bay"
,,Beautiful rainforest,5.0,,Such a beautiful place to spend time in. It is so hard to believe it is all man made. We didn't want to leave..
,,What a place,5.0,,This place is magical and a must visit on a Singapore trip Catch the shuttle bus for a small fee It's fully air conditioned in the cloud Forrest which u will love cause Singapore is hot as.
,,Cool place to visit,5.0,,The cloud forest is really worth the money spent it has a cool atmosphere to walk around and an indoor waterwall to visit as well a few levels to walk around on a sky bridge. You can combine the cost of this and the flower dome and pay one price (cheaper to do it this way) to enter $28. If you only have time to do one then pick the cloud forest it is far more interesting to visit and earns a 10 out of 10 for me.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"A cool respite from humidity of the City. Beautiful, well designed with so many features in every nook and cranny. Loved the informative presentation at the end about caring for our planet. Put aside a couple of hours to really enjoy the experience"
,,Nice to cool off in,5.0,,Lovely plants and waterfalls. Well organised to get so many people through easily. Stay for night light show a must.
,,Actually gets you up amongst the trees.,4.0,,"This event is coupled in with the flower dome so we were able to see both for a cost of (S$28). Well worth the money with plenty to see and do. Note that this experience is within a dome, therefore it can get pretty cold and wet - bring a coat/light jacket if you are prone to feeling the cold."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"This is probably the best possible way to tour a cloud forest replica under a very nice air conditioned space.You get to tour the different layers of the cloud forest through a sky walk. This is not only a feat of engineering, but also an awesome replication of biodiversity in a controlled environment. Definitely worth the admission price(did I mention is under air conditioning too?). If you love nature in any way , shape or form, than this would be an unforgettable experience."
,,So nice,5.0,,It is a great place to visit. The wood work that is scattered all over the place is great. It was is so nice an cool inside.
,,Nice trail way up,5.0,,Another beautiful place to go after the flower dome. The trail going up is very interesting and a bit scary. lol Tip: 1. Buy the Flower dome and Forest Cloud entrance fee together. 2. Its nice and cool here also.
,,spectacular !,5.0,,"the view of the waterfall is breathtaking, and when you think your gaining your breath again, you just loose it again, and again, and again ! green oasis full of flowers and nature ! a place worth the visit !"
,,Absolutely breathtaking,5.0,,"Even though Singapore has a lot to offer, THIS absolutely HAS TO BE at the very top of any list of things to do there. There is no way to describe it, you just have to see it. Have not been there in the evening so I do not know how the place looks lit up but can definitely recommend going during the day when all the mist machines and sprinklers get switched on. Absolutely breathtaking."
,,Incredible,5.0,,I was amazed by this incredible place! I could've sat for hours and just watched the world go by ! So much beauty and enchantment!
,,Beautiful,3.0,,"If you are looking for a beautiful place to escape the heat for a while, this is a wonderful choice. An incredible selection of beautiful plants around a central waterfall that you can walk to the top of. Not for those afraid of heights."
,,Worth a visit; essential to go up to the top (use the lift!),3.0,,An interesting structure and some pretty plants but I guess it's not like the real thing! Strange collection of broken bits of stalagmites and tites inside.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I hadn't looked at any pictures or reviews before I visited. This done is amazing, lovely to look at and listen too. Perfect opportunity to take some lovely photos."
,,Breathtaking! C,5.0,,Cloud forest (and Gardens by the bay) is one of my favorite destinations. Such a beautiful place to spend the day exploring.
,,Great,5.0,,It expensive in my opinion at $S28.00 for one person. The OCBC Skyway and Supertree Grove was off limits the day I visited. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest was worth the visit. It appears they are fully air conditioned. Make sure your cameras are fully charged. Absolutely magnificent.
,,Man made with natural features but false sustainability,4.0,,"Very cool place ( pardon the pun) Worth seeing both forest and plant domes. The only drawback is that it professes environmental sustainability but it displays 1,000 year old stalegtites and stalegmites hacked from their natural caves. This is environmental criminality not environmental sustainability"
,,Rain Forest comes to You :),5.0,,Just an awesome experience. Great walk through and all people were enjoying. Wonferful variety of things to see. Highly recomended.
,,Amazing -- go at night!,5.0,,"My husband and I visited the Cloud Forest twice during our day visit. First, we went during the day, and enjoyed walking through, but were a bit underwhelmed. Later, we went back, during a misting, at night, just before it closed. This was phenomenal. There is a whole different vibe, between the two times, and really worth visiting during both, purely for the contrast."
,,WOW,5.0,,"love to visit again , shall go next year . i visited with my friends and they are desperate and after life to visit this country again"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Though man made, its quite refreshing to be in this place. The skywalk in itself is very good and provides excellent view."
,,Fresh and chill air,5.0,,"Just superb, its worth buying the ticket and visit the cloud forest. The indoor waterfall is so refreshing, In the cloud forest, there are different level. And on the top level, you get a nice view of the falling water."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It's beautiful. If you love plants and colours, you'll enjoy it so much. Don't skip the walk from the tallest point (cloud walk?) To the entry level, it's charming.

It is VERY cold so bring something warm to cover yourself, as you'll be there for at least an hour."
,,Lovely and unusual,5.0,,The garden is filled with all sort of vegetation and beautifully design. One visit is insufficient. I made two more visits within a short period of time.
,,A must visit in Singapore for families,5.0,,"The cloud forest is an awesome place to visit especially for those with children. the wide variety of plants that you don't normally see in gardens and several endangered species are worth seeing. I just hope everyone can be responsible tourists by not touching or pinching the plants as the plants are for everyone to view and enjoy.

It feels a bit ethereal when you are at the bridge when they do the misting. It can be quite cool inside so it's good to bring some light covering."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,The cloud forest is a must see... it has a love of educative information and its a beauty and master piece. Very romantic to walk through and educative for kids. I definitely recommend the cloud forest during a visit to Singapore.
,,Really Worth Seeing,5.0,,"Whilst the Garden is free a ticket is needed to visit the domes. This can be bought in advance online (same price). The Cloud Forest is really huge and there is a high level walkway. Waterfalls, steamy heat and exotic plants. a real 'must' visit."
,,So well done,5.0,,Absolutely brilliant experience with this place. Walked around in awe at the brilliant job the architect has done in developing the structure the plants are just amazing and the additional information if you take the time to read it really causes you to stop and think about the state of the planet and the human impact
,,Interesting,5.0,,So well thought out and engaging. I loved the content there a well guided route suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The mist, the bruma and the Skywalk make the visit to the Cloud Forest an unique experience.
Take both Domes access starting from the flower dome, so that you leave with the Cloud Forest experience intact.
Make sure you don't have issues with heights. If not, a camera is a must. Enjoy."
,,Good attraction,5.0,,"Really good attraction only if you love trees, plants, and flowers. For others, it may be slightly boring."
,,Stunning! But mind those acrophobic people,5.0,,"There is a signature waterfall in the cloud forest, photo should be taken with it. And you will climb up to several levels and walk around the artificial hill. And on the way, there are explanations about the climates on mountains. Very educational!"
,,Going back to nature to refresh and revitalize,4.0,,"A cozy place to visit during a very hot sunny day and perhaps after a few days of outdoor attraction visit and shopping .
This is a ideal place for going back to nature to refresh and revitalize.
There are benches and toilet facilities in the dome itself.
Very cooling and serene enviroment to relax."
,,Best part of the Gardens,5.0,,"Really loved this part of the day. Inside the dome, were some breathtaking views of the waterfall and the misting."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It's like visiting a mini Niagara falls! Very cool and refreshing, with a wide array of beautifully maintained plants. Walk in the clouds is like a walk through heaven. An excellent choice given the heat in Singapore. Must do."
,,Stunning sightseeing,5.0,,This is one of the most beautiful places I have been to. The fall was impressively beautiful. Just go upstairs via the elevator and then enjoy the tour.
,,Cool and refreshing,5.0,,"Another gem of the Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest is a stunning attraction which has also educational purpose. A nice short walk to the top for a nice small garden and a nice view. Your way down will provide with a few lessons. As with the Flower Dome, it provides visitors with a cooling and refreshing break."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Fantastic, great, wow must be seen. Loved it, just loved it. It is an amazing place to visit. The waterfall and the way you interact with it is mind blowing."
,,Garden of Dreams,5.0,,If you love botanic gardens then this is an absolute must do! You can buy a ticket to see everything in the Gardens by the Bay but since I was on a budget I went just for seeing the Cloud Forest. It was magical and Cool. It's air conditioned which is a bonus since Singapore is so steamy.
,,Stunning attraction,5.0,,"We loved the cloud forest. The indoor waterfall is amazing, be warned you will get wet if you want to get the token photo underneath it. Its great walking around up the top,so much to see! Highly recommend checking this out."
,,"Wonderful , cool and refreshing as well as great views and planting.",5.0,,"Another must see in Singapore, a chnace to cool off fromt he heat and humidity , love the design and they explain the structure and plan of all the levels."
,,Inspiring..... Educational. A must go to place.,5.0,,We bought our ticket when we arrived in Chiangi Airport... It was easy rather than buying it in the Internet.
,,Amazing,5.0,,I would definitely go again and spend a couple of hours to explore. Amazing experience and amazing atmosphere. Worth every penny
,,Amazing Experience.,5.0,,They have recreated eco-system so well that you always feel like walking in a forest. Breathtaking views from the top. one should not miss this place.
,,Amazing Technology - High Altitude plants at Sealevel,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the most brilliant examples of technolgoy, engineering and clever thinking I have ever seen. The whole artificial ""'mountain"" is covered with plants, flowers, exotic species and awesome vegetation from all over. You can take a lift to the top and wander down through the different chambers and around the outside on a raised footpath. The top has a small lake with the most beautiful selection of pitcher plants and photographically the whole area within the dome is awesome. The climate is cleverly controlled so the top is similar to an area over 2000 ms in temperature so you can see a whole latitudinal series of ecosystems within an hour."
,,So cool and refreshing experience,5.0,,"A must visit in Singapore; such a cool and refreshing experience from the moment you enter the cloud forest you will be greeted with cool waterfall;
We enjoyed the cloud walk and non-stop picture taking due to the surrounding trees, plants, flower, water mists and rock formations and overlooking scenery outside;"
,,cool!,4.0,,"I visited the flower dome and cloud forest on the same day in Singapore back in April. It was extremely hot and humid outside and it felt great to get away from it all and even cooler to find out that the whole Gardens By The Bay is self sufficient with power and they dont actually use A/C to cool the buildings. We came with tickets purchased online ahead of time, not sure if that was cheaper or not but it was pretty easy to redeem. The waterfall was amazing as was the walkways suspended in the air giving you a view of Marina Bay. The walkways guide you through the whole thing, it is impossible to get lost. We went through the whole attraction and towards the end one of the rooms was talking about the earth and sustainability. I learned how the Gardens, Supertrees, water from the nearby bay all play a part in powering the whole area and it is almost fully sustainable by itself. I also learned that the planet earth has enough fresh water for about 6 billion people, but there are over 7 billion living on it(uh oh!).

I really enjoyed this attraction but probably won't go back when I return to Singapore unless I come back with someone who hasn't been and wants to go."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,A must visit place in Singapore trip. Man made waterfall which is beautiful. Walking at the top is great experience.
,,Mesmerizing...,3.0,,"The biggest climate controlled green house in the world. Beautiful but if you are not on a romantic date or otherwise massively into plants it is just a nice walk. I think we did it more because we had time than we because it was on our to-do list.

Nonetheless, we had fun and enjoyed the greenery and the atmosphere (and the incredibly fresh air!)"
,,Enjoy the splashes of waterfall!,5.0,,"Once enter, you will be greeted by a few storey high waterfall which can immediately let you feel refresh from the outside hot and humid weather. Enjoy very step, you will see many different plants and don't forget the mist at the top!"
,,Wonderful Experiance,5.0,,From the moment you walk into the building you'll be filled with joy and amazement at the display of flowers and the incredible waterfall. its also a good place to get out of that hot climate outside. If you like to take photos then here you can go wild its only up to your imagination that will limit your pictures. its a great place to put on your things to do in Singapore.I'll certainly go back next time its so good.
,,Beautiful Man Made Garden.,4.0,,"While in Singapore, this is a must visit place. The sheer size of the Building housing this man made garden makes you wonder the efforts that have gone in to make this garden look as good as real. Be it the lovely falls or the rock designed garden, the various plants, trees and fountains, the water droplets spraying around and the very cool temperatures is something worth a visit."
,,Exceptional fantastic place,5.0,,For Singapore this was a good value ticket and to see a man made waterfall and treetop walk is quite breath taking. I would recommend to anyone as a must see
,,Amazing indoor Rainforest,5.0,,It's an incredible man made structure that really gives you the impression of the different elements that are present in a rainforest. The waterfall is really impressive.
,,Cloud Forest - no clouds but you are in or above a tropical paradise!,5.0,,Was really gorgeous - was a little busy with people to fully enjoy but still well worth the visit! Walking along the sky bridge gave you a gorgeous perspective - also some 'side' displays were also interesting.
,,Wow! Really amazing!,5.0,,"The waterfall was beautiful and the way was incredible too. I definitely enjoyed a lot here. I little bit of cold inside, but nothing to worried."
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,"Amazing experience, brings you into the mountains of Asia.. The walk from the top is really cool and makes the whole experience come alive."
,,Informative and fun!,5.0,,"The cloud forest is an artificially created forest in Gardens by the Bay. You get to see the different types of plants that grow at different heights in tropical forests. I love how they link the issue of climate change with how these forests will change over time. I also love that they explain the initiatives the Gardens by the Bay is taking to use renewable energy and reduce its carbon emissions. Cloud forest has a separate entry ticket in Gardens by the Bay, and I would highly recommend a visit to it for a fun experience walking in the forest like area, surrounded by mist :)"
,,Great Place to Visit,5.0,,"Singapore's Gardens by the Bay are one of the must see things here, even if you're not really into gardens. Simply spectacular."
,,It's like walking in a rain forest. Its cold inside.,5.0,,It is very nice. Its cold inside. It looks like a rain forest. It has a nice waterfall. It is good for all ages.
,,An ifacinating concept to show the beauty of nature,5.0,,"Try to follow the Tour to the top, do in the evening, and get a stunning experience with the beauty of lights among the beautiful plants."
,,Flower dome was better than this,3.0,,"There is nothing much to see here and I liked flower dome more than this. No harm is seeing this as a combo ticket is available cheap.

The temperature inside the dome is cold and very comforting away from the outside heat and humidity.

Easily accessible from Bay Front MRT."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Must-see, but rather during the day than at night because of the colours which appear brighter during day time. Although you have to pay the entrance, it's really worth it."
,,"Definitely one of the best, if not the best!",5.0,,"I have visited many botanical gardens, but nothing compared to this one. It's a brilliant concept of nature and science. There was not one corner of this atrium that wasn't picturesque. Simply jaw dropping!"
,,Cloud 9,4.0,,Cloud Forest located in the Gardens by the Bay is one of the major attraction with artificial water fall and few creepers & flowers it a different concept. Definitely worth the visit.
,,Excellent Place to visit,5.0,,"This is a most amazing place to visit, especially people coming from cities. This place has nature at its best and very well controlled environment helps rare plants grow. Keep atleast 1-2 hours for this."
,,Pretty garden,5.0,,All scenery is stunning from a ground view up to the canopy view. Stop ans study the sculptures hodden around the gardens they are mind blowing.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Highly recommend a visit. A lovely respite from the heat outside. Very disabled friendly with ramps and elevators.
,,A nice escape from the heat & humidity of Singapore,5.0,,"Located within the 'Gardens by the Bay', the Cloud Forest is one of two 'domes', that are home to a variety of plant species that can't cope with the Singapore climate and a nice cool, refreshing temperature after wondering around in the heat & humidity. The best parts of this experience, is the waterfall and the descent from the top of the 'mountain' like structure in the middle, on a narrow walkway that struts out and is suspended in mid air, giving good views of the dome. Not for those with a fear of heights!"
,,Avatar like garden,4.0,,"Just like the garden from the movie Avatar, it's surreal. You can chose to not see it if you are interested in seeing the plants of the world, which is available in conservatory 1. You can then chose to buy just one conservatory ticket."
,,Magical,5.0,,Just go - amazing recreation of some of the world's most fragile environments. Beautiful. Worth timing your visit for when misters are turned on - see the 'mountain top' wreathed in cloud.
,,A Great place,5.0,,"A beautiful waterfall, misty environment and beautiful displays of nature. A perfect place to spend your evening in nature, in Singapore."
,,Nice indoor garden,4.0,,"Went with friends and, this is not exactly what we expected, and basically it's the very definition of stereotype. Me and my friends were expecting a hot and humid environment like you would see at a botanical garden at home ; Canada. And we were wondering why they would build such a thing when everyday it's hot and humid outdoors ....a bit of reading would have helped our understanding. In any case, great attraction especially if you come from a hot and humid climate. Huge variety of plants from across the world in beautiful arrangements. If you come from a cold climate , still very nice as the entire design is amazing, and a good break from the heat. To that point , visitors may want to bring a very light jacket

The price is a bit steep, even more so if you are a non resident. But with the amount of cooling and water required it's somewhat understandable.

I would recommend both sections of the attraction, if you have time and are willing to spend the money"
,,Artificial nature... not my cup of tea.,2.0,,"Nature as artefact... very strange. Too manicured, too precious, on the verge of tacky. Not really pleasing or particularly appealing after the first few minutes of amazement and intrigue by the size of it and by its artificial beauty. Not my cup of tea."
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"Visited this men made forest in a Dom Artificial falls ,natural plants, cool ,clean,surrounding ,sky walk, and what not .One can happily spend time here. Must visit place.They show short documentary +5 on climate change good and informative .Enjoyed the visit."
,,"Artificial, yet astounding",5.0,,"One of the best places in Singapore to visit.. The artificial waterfall.. The cloud experience, the forest and the movie at the end about the nature are the best take aways from this place.. Thoroughly enjoyed the facility with an awesome view.."
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is one of two domes which you can visit at Gardens at the Bay. Simply stunning, the beauty of the place is striking as soon as you enter and gaze at the inside waterfall. The design that went into constructing this dome and the ecosystem is incredible. Do not miss this!"
,,amazing,5.0,,spent an entire morning in here so many plants to see and enjoy lifts available if needed but the walk ways are easy to negotiate so cool and fresh which is great after Hot and humid outside
,,A must do,5.0,,Cloud Forrest is the best place to visit and you will not regret the visit - take the family through the forrest and see what it holds -- great craftsmanship
,,Mind Blowing,5.0,,"This place is fantastic! It is gorgeous, it is beautiful, it is frankly just amazing and totally worth it in every way. I would highly recommend it on every level. If you're low on cash and need to choose between the flower dome and the cloud dome, choose the CLOUD dome! It's much prettier and frankly it has more flowers than the flower dome!"
,,Really Cool Experience,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the Cloud Forest. If nothing else, it's a nice break from the Singapore heat. It's a unique experience and incredibly beautiful. The waterfall when you first walk in is breathtaking. It is accommodating to guests with disabilities (elevators for each level) so I recommend for anyone, all ages."
,,"Walk through the ""jungle""",5.0,,"I went here at night so I believe it's completely different from daylight. There's a big waterfall and you can walk through the ""clouds"" using flyovers around all the ""forest"". Bring jacket or you will get very cold.
At the end you can watch a short documentary about the climate change."
,,Walking in the sky in the midst of forest,3.0,,It has a little water fall. Visitors will experience sprinkle of droplets from the water fall. We took a lift to a certain height and slowly stroll down. The feeling will be a combination of walking in the sky in the midst forest. For people who enjoy heights and nature will love this. It happens that I have acrophonia. I got a little upset that no one inform me that I need to go up such a height when I buy the tickets for this dome. I spend the entire visit with a pounding heart and almost crawling on the floor. This dome is not for people who have high blood pressure and acrophonia.
,,Amazing achievement,5.0,,Even if you are not into plants it is a worthwhile effort to go and see what can be done in what is essentially an artificial climate where forestry and water combine to illustrate cycles of nature.
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,Really enjoyed visit here but looks bigger on tv. Definitely worth a visit. Toilet and gift shop next to it
,,Koshken,3.0,,"Place is big nice and cooling but not much interesting plant to see, when I went over that day one section is close so I have not completed the whole place."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I enjoyed a peaceful afternoon, late evening here and took too many photos. One note of caution, if you are afraid of heights then the upper walkway is not for you."
,,Amazing construction very nicely done,5.0,,I really wasn't expecting a great deal of this attraction but I'm so glad I went. It is a breathtaking piece of work and genuinely interesting and well put together. A must for plant and nature lovers
,,Fascinating experience,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is an amazing experience. I have never seen anything like it in my travels across the world. Very well organized and easy to access with kids and family.
,,The Best Exhibit in the gardens by the bay,4.0,,Lots of awesome picture opportunities in here. Be careful of your dslr lens as you get out as it might get fogged.
,,Beautiful indoor waterfall....you may get wet!!,5.0,,This was my favourite feature at the Gardens of the bay and you do have to pay a minimal amount to enter but it's worth it. You are able to walk behind the fall with well thought out walkways.
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,Best attraction in Singapore. Worth coming here just to see this. Kinda spills the rest of the Gardens by the Bay by comparison
,,sci-fi and space lab?,4.0,,I felt as if I was in a space laboratory Very sci-fi feeling. This may be the future someday. Plus I liked the feeling of defending down and seeing various levels of the flora system. Well done!
,,A must visit attraction in Singapore...really worth,5.0,,It is a different experience...very cool and soothing environment... any age person can enjoy here.. the best part of Gardens by the Bay..
,,gardens in the sky,5.0,,"loved the stroll through the gardens. so much to look at, leisurely and worthwhile. The views from the walkways were lovely including views across parts of Marina Bay and the wider area."
,,Great value for money,5.0,,"Spectacular and very absorbing, this is a great half day tour that you can do in the middle of the day. very well done and presented."
,,Highlight,5.0,,"Very happy with this dome, sky walk, flower, Waterfall, feel very fresh in this zone all presentation."
,,Cloudy but not,5.0,,As travellers who have been here several times it is always a great relief to get out of the Singapore heat and into a refreshingly cool atmosphere. Beautiful plants and things to see. Always different and very easy access for a wheelchair. Especially nice when the air is being misted. Supercool !!
,,An Enchanting Forest on Cloud Nine,5.0,,"Stroll through magical rain forest complete with waterfalls and misty clouds in an air-conditioned dome.

Experience the wonders of nature in all its respledescent glory in a refreshing environment that will soothe the stressful veins through your body.

Refresh! Rejuvenate! Rejoice!

Truly an invigorating experience not to be missed!"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Nice way to spend an afternoon. The cool indoors temperature is a very pleasant contrast to the balmy outdoors! It's a bit pricey (20 something dollars) but I imagine it takes a lot to maintain the place. From the ticket stand, they offer a shuttle for $3 (there and back). In retrospect, it wouldn't have been far to walk (maybe 10 mins) so I think the shuttle is a bit of a gimmick. That said, if you're tired, treat yourself. We did!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Been there a few times. It was an amazing experience everytime I went there with my kids. Who can imagine that a ""vertical forest"" can be done this way. Breathtaking. Cloud Forest is a place not to be missed. This is 1 of the places that made Singapore proud. Even ""Hitman"" were filmed here."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Really interesting and worth the visit. A unique place to visit with the family but take a jumper because it's cool inside.
,,Loving it! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,5.0,,"Though I am a Singaporean myself, it was only now (years later after it was build) that I set foot to garden by the bay, I should say I enjoyed myself very much! I brought my Grandmother, aunt and mother over, it was very nice, it's just like walking in a beautiful park in a lovely weather. If only we could do picnics! It's a good place to bring the folks out for a gathering! Love it!"
,,A good respite from the heat of the city,4.0,,It's a nice break from the heat of the gardens. It is also very child friendly (stroller included). You can take the elevator up to the top floor and make your way down.
,,Magical!,5.0,,Done amazingly! The waterfall and gardens are truly magical and worth a walk around...I'm a little scared of heights so walking out on the metal floors high up made my tummy a little squirmish but managed it fine! Really pretty!
,,Good Attraction,5.0,,"Visited just before the flower gardens.

Quite chilly inside as it's recreating a rainforest.

Beautiful flowers and carvings and a massive waterfall inside the dome.

Definitely worth a visit, takes about an hour to complete the walk through.

You can buy tickets that cover both this and the flower garden dome, if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass you also get a discount."
,,Excellent indoor waterfalls,5.0,,It is updated as one of the worlds largest indoor waterfall with lot of exotic plants around it. It simulates tropical cloud forest and is very real.
,,Spectacular and immersive,4.0,,Enter the Cloud and dive deep in a green sea surrounded by flowers and little animals. A pleasant experience even if may scare who's concerned by altitude and see though bridges..
,,Holiday,5.0,,"One of those attractions must do, must go! Beautiful garden, amazing flowers...Stunning Orchids! Loved the whole Gardens by the Bay. Awesome!"
,,"Wonderful vie of a rain forest with a large waterfall, all under glass dome",5.0,,"A must see on Singapur, it cost about 25 usd and it allows to visit both the cloud forest and the flower garden. Is air conditioned a extremé luxury on Singapore hot weather.

Impressive flora, architecture and engineering marvel. The wood art amazing.

If you do both gardens it will take you from 1 1/2 hrs to 2 1/2 depending if you stop to contemplate the exhibits."
,,Great for everyone!,5.0,,Beautifully done. Nothing like I've seen before. Had a friend visiting from San Francisco who also loved it. Quite unique. You can learn lots. The waterfall is beautiful. It's peaceful and serene. Great way to spend a bit of time.
,,nothing like it,5.0,,This place is just out of the world !! never could imagine a garden like this with various flora n fauna n a artificial waterfall..The plants are just amazing n made me go to lala land.. Place is just too good for couples on a honey moon..
,,Is this what heaven looks like!,5.0,,Oh my! This is truly one of the most wonderful places I have ever seen. I absolutely had the best afternoon / evening ever!
,,Fantasic,5.0,,An amazing recreation of a rain forest. It is possible to get wet when they spray the water. Check the schedule because once a month the skywalk is closed for maintainance.
,,Amazing Conservatory,5.0,,"This is a must visit place, but for old travelers and children I highly recommend a warm jacket as the Conservatory is temperature controlled and can get really cold for old and very young."
,,Fascinating exhibition of diverse ecosystems,5.0,,"We roamed around the Cloud Forest at night after the light show at Gardens by the Bay during the misting which from memory is every hour. It was a highlight of our stay in Singapore and worth the price of admission. Beautiful, interesting and informative."
,,Not bad but idea,3.0,,The idea seems not bad but to much concret. For my understanding it's to synthetic. It feels more than a business idea to make money with tourists.
,,Manmade waterfall is a first for me,5.0,,"Great place to see at least once, especially if you are just visiting. It has an indoor waterfall with plants and walkways. It is a nice place to relax and enjoy a cold place in Singapore. The whole dome has aircon! Book the Cloud Forest with the Flower Dome to get a discount."
,,"Wow, best Botanic presentation I have ever seen.",5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the two conservatories at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore and absolutely the best. With multi-story water falls, caves and sky-walks, this is the best indoor garden presentation I have seen. You actually walk out into the clouds. (those with a fear of heights may not be so enthused). This is one of the top attractions in Singapore. The outdoor gardens are free but the two conservatories cost $ 28 SD to go through."
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,"Combined with our trip to the Gardens of the Bay - a fabulous and impressive experience, with great views of the whole of Singapore."
,,Breath of fresh air,5.0,,"What a wonderful place to escape the city, really well done and beautiful place. Do drop in and visit, well worth it."
,,How close can you get to heaven,5.0,,"It was raining outside but this was not going to dampen our visit to the garden in the clouds. Entering into the mist and glancing up at the waterfall, only to have your breath taken away. Beautiful at every turn of your head. Nature is just beautiful and what they have achieved here is nothing short of spectacular. I am pleased for the digital world of photography as you are constantly clicking. Just jaw dropping!"
,,Beauty Oleh!,5.0,,Beauty and Fragrance that appeals to your senses. Don't miss the opportunity to see the different species of fauna. Truly terrific for those in love with the plant kingdom. Had a prized day indeed!
,,Quite Specacular!,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the cloud forest dome at Gardens by the Bay. They have re created the Eco system very well, and there is a message about the effects of global warming at the end. We probably spent about an hour there, enjoying the plants, waterfall and vistas from the various lookout points."
,,This place is amazing,5.0,,If you a have a few hours to visit the Gardens by the bay do it. This huge glass house is unbelievable. The relief from the heat inside the cloud forest is wonderful but the actual gardens inside are something to see.Take you time to read the information as it is very informative and the technology supporting this structure is state of the art.
,,Something everyone should experience,5.0,,The waterfall when you walk in draws your eyes to the sky and also the plant life that is surrounding and underneath it. It is also a way to cool off from the heat.
,,An incredible experience for all ages!,5.0,,This place was amazing! It takes you along a walkway into what a real cloud forest would look like. It's in a huge dome with a massive waterfall spraying cool air onto you. I'd recommend a light jacket! It's a great thing to do alongside the flower dome - you need a good 2.5-3 hours to really do both properly and then more time for the free garden area outside. The Audio Guided Tour is good if you don't have time to walk around the outside garden. It's $8 for 20 minutes.
,,Cold Forest,5.0,,Not many changes on this area from time to time. The one I remember is this place quite cold. You can walk in high bridge here and see many flower and plantation. You can also see stalaktit and mit.
,,CLOUD FOREST - The Beautiful Mountain In Central City of Singapore,5.0,,"There are 2 giant glass houses at The Gardens By The Bay (Singapore), one is located next to the other. Both facades are of irregular hyperbolic shape. One glass house is much higher than the other. If the higher one is a mountain, then the other one is a hill. You can also say that they look like giant ocean waves.

The much higher glass house is CLOUD FOREST & the lower one is FLOWER DOME. Together with the SUPER TREE GROVE they form the famous award winning THE GARDENS BY THE BAY.

The CLOUD FOREST occupies 0.8 hectares (2.0 acres) of land. Once you step into it, a 42-metre (138 ft) green mountain with a stunning 35-metre (115 ft) waterfall welcomes you & locks you on site for quite sometime taking pictures.

It is a mountain, the temperature is controlled to that of mountainous & it has a collection of plants that grow on heights between 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level.

You can choose to go to the mountain top by elevator, and walk down via a circular walkway. Along the way down you can enjoy being like exactly in a real mountain environment with plants & flowers around you.

For me, half a day is too short to be in CLOUD FOREST alone. You will need another day to visit the FLOWER DOME which is just opposite."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Walking into this air conditioned Dome of the Cloud Forest is sensational. The orchids, plants and ferns are gorgeous. The 35 metre man made mountain and waterfall as well as the wide bridges are amazing. A highlight of Singapore sightseeing!"
,,Impressive design and a must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"The display of foliage is truly impressive and feels just like walking among the clouds. Great for both kids and elders alike and it is a must visit in my opinion. Indoor water falls, misty walkways set high up and covered with plants and trees; words simply can't describe the awesomeness."
,,Tourism,5.0,,unique experience! nature meets technology and together provide one view of mother nature like i have never experienced before
,,Beautiful and cool,5.0,,We entered the cloud dome after an extremely hot walk across the gardens and immediately felt reenergised! The waterfall as you enter is spectacular and very cooling; we all enjoyed the range of plants and walk down from the top. The only negative is the stalactites and stalagmites that were apparently harvested from caves - this seems inconsistent with the environmental message they're trying to get across.
,,Artificial waterfall,5.0,,Not a big waterfall but it's pretty high. Must take photo here. Don't forget to protect you things from water splash.
,,Unique vertical garden.,4.0,,A visit to the cloud forest is a logical part of any visit to the Gardens by the Bay area in Singapore. This is a unique vertical garden. Very impressive.
,,Photos can not do it justice. Captivating!,5.0,,I was so excited to visit and was a little worried it may not be everything I had imagined it to be. This was not the case. I loved every minute (well just about) in the cloud dome. I am scared of heights and so couldn't do the boardwalks. Even still I think it is worth going to the top and seeing everything that you can. It was amazing. My husband took the children so I could wander and absorb. Not the best attraction for toddlers but not every outing needs to be about them. I highly recommend to any nature or garden lover.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,This is worth a visit as there are high walkways amongst waterfalls that also have fantastic views of the harbour
,,Impressive,5.0,,Modern contemporary style dome housing exotic plants and flowers. A great addition to Singapores Botanical offerings
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"A wonderful couple of hours were spent here. An Amazing place with loads of vegetation, water and sculptures."
,,An amazing place,5.0,,"If you have a late flight fill in your late morning to mid afternoon here. it is amazing and well worth it. If you travel Singapore airlines you will get a reduced admission rate, take your boarding pass..."
,,Jungle minus the bugs,5.0,,"The cloud forest dome is the jungle you visit when you don't want to get up close and personal with the real thing. It is an educational experience where you will see an amazing array of plants from places you are unlikely to encounter otherwise.

The dome can get crowded during weekends and public holidays, and selfie-sticks are endemic. Nevertheless, it is well worth the visit."
,,Beutiful and inspiring experience,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore , you have to visit the cloud forest , the walk is wonderful with orchids and exotic flowers every where, and at times the mist will make you feel like your in a real forest."
,,seeing is believing,5.0,,"Singapore gives so many great places of interest Gardens by the Bay is world class,from the highest indoor waterfall to the cloud forest it has to been seen to believed"
,,Great.,5.0,,Go early before the rush. Book before leaving to go to Singapore. there are some good deals your travel agent can organise for you.
,,Truly a wonderful experience,5.0,,A man made mountain with forest and hundreds of tree species. This experience cant be seen anywhere else. A must watch place.
,,Serene and peaceful,4.0,,Go during the misting time (10 am and 12 pm) for a feel like walking in the clouds. Definitely worth a visit.
,,The one of the finest waterfall made by human,5.0,,"i just love it, it is amazing to visit and stay there for 2-3 hours, must visit this place whenever you go to singapore."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"This is a stunning attraction, for all age groups. The indoor waterfall, at 35 metres drop, is stunning. Takle your time and wander through the various levels and try to be in the dome during a cloud formation time - It's fascinating to watch the clouds form, either above you or below you, depending on what level you are on."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"An amazing experience. Definitely a must see while in Singapore. You must take a walk up to the top, i am scared f heights, but it is worth the walk up to the top. Extremely humid inside the dome. Amazing plants and waterfalls throughout the climb up to the top."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is my favourite of the 2 domes. So natural the waterfall is amazing, always a treat to visit. The plants are so varied and the different gardens are wonderful"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"We visited here and it was stunning. If you're afraid of heights, don't bother.... but if you're not, it's well worth every penny. It's gorgeous and nice and cool in there. A must see in Singapore!"
,,Nothing much to see,4.0,,ONe time see. Nothing much special . May be because we missed a show scheduled at 6.oo pm . Its along with the way of Gardens by the bay
,,A unique 'must visit' in Singapore,5.0,,"The cloudforest is one of the three ‘big’ attractions within Singapores iconic ‘gardens by the bay’ – a nature parking spanning 250 acres in central Singapore. The cloudforest has been designed to stimulate mountainous rainforest, with an impressive 7 story central structure covered in rare vegetation and dripping with artificial waterfalls. It is certainly a very impressive and unique structure.

Here are a few things of note for those considering a visit here.
(1) The cloudforest is located in a glass building and has an airconditioning unit that keeps the temperature in the low 20’s. This is very pleasant to provide reprieve from the intense Singapore heat and humidity. It can also serve as a retreat if you are caught in the gardens by the bay during one of singapores daily 1-2 hour long rainshowers.
(2) It is open from 0900 to 2100 so can be visited at any time day or night.
(3) Periodically the sprinklers are turned on to create a ‘mist’ effect.
(4) Although it is free to enter the gardens by the bay, it costs 28 dollars for entry into both the flower dome and the cloudforest. If you are a tourist I would suggest visiting both.
(5) To get here you go on the MRT to bayfront. This is on the yellow line, or otherwise you can transfer from Marina Bay on the red line.

It takes around 1.5 hours to get through the cloudforest. If you are coming here I would suggest combining it with all the other attractions of the gardens by the bay such as the flower dome and supertree groove. The supertree groove is particularly impressive at night with its wonderful flower show at 1945 so coming here in the late afternoon and sticking around for the light show isn’t a bad option."
,,One of my favs in Singapore,5.0,,We picked this over the flower side and were not disappointed. Lovely and cool break from the humid weather.
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,Worth every bucks we pay. The place is so clean and well maintained. The atmosphere was exactly like walking in woods (Night time) with those temperatures and beautifully decorated shrubs and creepers. The algae at certain places makes one to assume that it is a real forest. The walk at floor 6 or 7 was peaceful and enchanting. A must visit place when in Singapore.
,,Visit during a hot day,5.0,,Beautifully designed indoor giant green house in the tropics. It houses many subtropical plants in a man made mountain structure where plants are grown on the slopes.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,This is an amazing experience. The first thing which hits you as you enter is the mist and greenery across almost three levels. The waterfalls are amazing and the journey to the top is enriching. The walkway is breath-taking and feels as if you are in the Amazon sky. Its truly an enriching experience. It gets a bit cold inside but you adjust to the temperature. Marvelous architecture.
,,Quite amazing,4.0,,"Really is quite amazing the build here, the height, light,atmosphere. Make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy."
,,A real dream scape!,5.0,,"Understandably, this location is used in many movies. the multi tiers cat walks provided as great perspective of the exhibit. Truly a cool site."
,,I preferred this over the Flower Dome,5.0,,"First of all, this dome is colder than than the Flower Dome. Dont stand too close to the waterfall or you'll definitely get wet. The highlight if the elevated walkway -- 6 stories up. Dont attempt if you are afraid of heights or prone to dizziness."
,,A must see when you visit Singapore,5.0,,This is a truly amazing place. On entering you are greeted by massive waterfall. As you climb upwards the plants reflect those growing at various altitudes until you are up in the mist in the mountains. The planting is very impressive. NEVER seen anything like this before. Don't miss it
,,One of the Favorites,5.0,,"It is so beautiful all those green areas with different level walks. It has the highest indoor waterfall in it and I enjoyed there a lot. They also prepared very well done projected movie about global warming. It was very interesting to watch. Because it is very crowded, try to go early."
,,must see in singapore,5.0,,Its been created in a beautiful way.. and you can remain minimum two hours inside this slowly exploreing the greenery..
,,Highlight of Gardens by the bay!,4.0,,"I recently had another chance to visit the Cloud Forest conservatory with 6 of my guests from India. They were between 13 and 67 years old.

Upon alighting in Bayfront MRT it seemed about a 2km walk to the conservatories. Despite the frequent stopping and photo taking on the way the ages were tired of walking. There is a sort of tram ride available for $3/person which will shuttle between conservatories. This was useful especially on the way back.

Based on previous visits I had decided not to go for flower dome as nothing very exciting there. But for people who want to visit both conservatories, quickly finish the flower dome and spend more time in cloud forest. OcBc credit card payment has some promotion for buying tickets. Locals and foreigners ticket pricing is different.

Typical warm and humid atmosphere outside makes the breezy cold weather inside of cloud forest very comfortable. Everyone appreciated and mentioned about it. Generally none wanted to get out.

Artificial water falls and the walk around on 7th floor were really worth watching and walking. Weekend crowding may invite long queues to get into the elevator to 7th floor. However the staff manage them well.

Nice place!"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"Well worth the visit, totally amazing. Spend as long as you like in there. Plenty of room. The Plants and colours were awesome."
,,"CLOUD FOREST, Gardens By The Bay, Singapore",5.0,,"Don't miss going to Cloud Forest when in Singapore.

Believe me, it will immediately catch your attention & attract happy feeling inside you once you step into it.

You will experience "" climate change "" once inside. You will forget your sorrows or whatever bothering you once you step in & see the 35-metre waterfall welcoming you.

You can indulge yourself the whole day inside from then on.........

Welcome to the city state of Singapore.........."
,,Pictures do it justice,4.0,,"I had seen many pictures of this place for a few months now while planning this Singapore trip and to be honest it was exactly how the pictures portrayed it and nothing more. Despite this, it was very pretty! Quite a bit of a walk so make sure you have proper walking shoes. It was also very very cold, so make sure to take a jacket. A downside was that it was very crowded with locals. It made it hard to get photos as people were constantly coming in the way. But alas this is most tourist destinations now. Definitely worth checking out though!"
,,An Amazing Place,5.0,,We went to the Cloud Forest for my husband's birthday. It was a wonderful experience. Everything was thought out so well. Very clever attraction and very educational. So beautiful. We never saw anything like it.

,,Must see in life,5.0,,"I'll never forget this place.

35 m high artificial mountain inside a dome where the tropical weather has been recreated.
Walk up the mountain to enjoy a huge variety of flowers, plants, stones and a beautiful waterfall.
UNFORGETTABLE"
,,Man made wonder,5.0,,Very interesting place. Great to see man made green spaces in such a tiny country. Impressive! Take the time to go in the evening as well when the lights come on and the place looks magical.
,,Great Attraction,5.0,,"An extension of the Gardens by the Bay exhibit, walking in the Cloud Forest was truly a magical experience, felt like some we were in some exotic place like the Amazon jungle."

,,"Don't Worry, its totally COOL Inside",5.0,,"Bought the tickets online at voyagin.com and showed the pdf files on my Smartphone at the ticket booths. Got a stamp on my hand and proceeded inside.
Upon entering the Air Conditioned dome you are greated with an artificial waterfall 7 stories high. Take some photos here before proceeding to the remainder of the plantations on display.
Not much to say about the plants but it was more on how the arrangements of the landscaping of this massive glass dome that took my breathe away.
It is a good exercise in walking and visitors are allowed to come back to the dome after visiting other areas of the garden complex.
Elderly visitors are also catered for with lifts and very subtle slopes for walking.

Brilliantly designed!"
,,Is it worth visiting?,5.0,,"Singapore is a burgeoning city that has grown from humble beginnings and has introduced innovative buildings, attractions and infrastructures that are the envy of the world. The Cloud Forest is one of these incredible attractions that just stop your breath with its incredible simplicity but awesome complexity in equal measure. The structure has no internal upright supports which allow far reaching internal vistas across the amazing space. The floral displays are incredible in their size, beauty and magnificence and there are stunning carved creations which emerge from natural tree stumps dotted around the dome. You become rather blasé but these alone are worth your admission charge. One surprising feature was just how cool it was within the dome. We were expecting exhausting greenhouse heat, however it was very refreshing and at a comfortably pleasant temperature, which was incredibly welcome to escape the unpleasantly soaking heat of Singapore. I'd recommend that you visit the Flower Dome first before the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is fantastic however the Cloud Forest takes you to a new level (literally) and will blow you away. If you visit Singapore for a brief visit, you CANNOT leave the city without visiting the Domes. Incredible."
,,Spend time just looking,5.0,,Very large display of lots of plants and flowers. Spend time just walking the different levels from the top to the bottom
,,Night time spectacular,4.0,,Although we have been here before during the day we visited it at night and it was very enjoyable. You get a differnt feeling at night and the atmosphere was surreal. Well well maintained and a great collection of flora. The walk gives you a great relaxing feeling. Make sure you watch the light show after visiting here as it is spectacular.
,,That waterfall ...,5.0,,"Amazing sight to behold and the plants....must see if you're into plants. The atmosphere with the background music to match, birds, jungle sounds, the mist...wow!"
,,An amazing place,5.0,,A fabulous place inside the Gardens by the Sea. The walk-around is simply amazing and the separate admission price is certainly worth it.
,,Nice but exhausting,4.0,,"Beautiful sights and trees. The tempratuee inisde is too low, take proper clothing. Don't go at night."
,,So beautiful & worth the visit,5.0,,"We wondered wether it would be worth the money to bother. Definitely go, it IS worth the visit. It is all man made eco systems & an amazing water fall that you can get up & close to."
,,"TWO WORDS....""ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!!!""",5.0,,"NO words or even pics ( Even with our armada of Digital media,cameras,smartphones, go-pros), could ever come come close to the fantastic experience of going to CLOUD FOREST!!!....all I can say is ...""YOU MUST GO HERE!!!"""
,,"Cloud of Forest,",5.0,,"As the name suggests, its just like a cloud of forest only. With different height levels, its a very well maintained forest inhouse."
,,Amazingness,5.0,,"I loved my journey to cloud forest in gardens by the bay. I went there in February and I was wowed. So much beauty, flora and fauna. Such architecture skill."

,,28SGD for Cloud Forest & Flower Dome,5.0,,Easy to walk trail. A man made waterfall inside. Located just next to Flower Dome. 28SGD for both attractions. Must see!!
,,See an unexpected aspect of Singapore,4.0,,"At great expence Singapore has developed and expanded another attraction to explore and enjoy Singapore. Even if not a garden fan, it is worth a visit to experience this location out of the Singapore humidity and warm temperatures."
,,Excellent concept. Great execution,5.0,,The overall experience is fascinating. Journey through a garden that resembles the cloud forests. very educative and beautiful. must see for all ages.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,A must see attraction in Singapore. Has an incredible futuristic feel about it. Good activity to do during mid-day as it's cooler inside as they need to keep the plants at a cooler temperature. Worth every cent. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
,,Amazing,5.0,,A incredible experience but it's too bad that nobody mentioned that you're in the fridge during one hour because the place is under a regulate temp and it's a icy place
,,Etheral and amazing,5.0,,"This dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay area and you'd be completely crazy to miss out on seeing it. We took the train here in order to save our feet.

You're initially greeted by a huge waterfall (so cooling) and then you get to do a slow climb upwards through a forest of plans and sculptures and other magical things.

Don't want to give any more away - just go and enjoy. It's worth it."
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,The place is very beautiful . The Nature is fantastic.If you good in the evening is more beatiful. We have to pay to enter it.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the best places we have ever visited, very neat and clean, good maintenance, artificial water falls, sky bridge lots of green plants, fossil and very nice view of Merina Bay."
,,With in the Gardens by the bay,4.0,,The waterfalls and walkways are spectacular and this is educational as well. Worth a visit for all ages.
,,Breathtaking in the most literal sense of the word,5.0,,"My girlfriend took me to the Cloud Forest without telling me anything about what to expect. I went in with a blank slate thinking that it was basically a greenhouse of sorts. I was absolutely blown away by the mangnifence of the place. If you're going to the gardens by the bay you simply MUST see the cloud forest. It was arguably my favorite part of my trip to Singapore (honourable mention for the art and science museum as well) and for only $16, it was truly a value. We easily spent a good two hours in there and the video (no spoilers) at the end truly leaves an impact. The nature and waterfalls are beautiful in and of themselves but the sustainable technology that makes it possible is an attraction in and of itself (there's an area before the exit that explains how it's all made possible). In my opinion, no trip to the gardens is complete without a visit to the cloud forest."
,,Amazing Indoor Forest,5.0,,You are first amazed by the stunning architecture of the buildings. Once inside you are confronted by the sight and sounds of the spectactulat waterfall. Once you get past that you are on a path of amazing plant life and displays from right across globe. You wind your way reasonably effortlessly to the very top of the waterfall and then trek down. This is most poular tourist attraction so the going can be slow but is well worth it as get to soak in the tropical atmosphere and wondrous display of tropical plant life. Easy to spend an hour or so taking it all in.
,,Guided walk,5.0,,Participants were enjoy very much the guided walk in the cloud forest particular the water fall view from TOP and plants on the huge wall. Admire the trip hope to come back again.
,,Excellent,5.0,,This is a must see attraction for people who loves the nature. Its like an artificial forest with waterfall and fog.
,,Mesmerizing!,5.0,,"Being a gardening enthusiast, it was a super treat. The sheer number of plant species, flowering and ornamental was mind boggling. We reached just in time for the misting at 6pm and soon the lights added to the beauty. The climb up the staircase to the top was worth it because as we came down the winding path thousands of orchids and flowers I couldn't name, huge driftwood animal shapes took my breath away. Very crowded but one could stand and admire the beauty without being pushed. The film at the end of it was beautiful and inspiring about nurturing the environment."
,,Amazing place...Must see,5.0,,Amazing place and breathtaking opulence..havent seen anything like this anywhere..the entire thing works effortlessly and the flora on display is superb with the waterfall taking the cake...
,,Amazing,5.0,,"An excellent display and the waterfall is something else. I loved the sculptures integrated into the displays, especially the wood carvings."

,,Beautiful view inside and out,5.0,,The vertical gardens are mesmerising and the waterfall refreshing. Definitely worth visiting but maybe leave it til later in the day as it can get quite crowded due to the tour groups. This sunset views over the harbour can also be caught through the glass walls of the dome. Would definitely be worth recommending. It's open 9am-9pm daily unless otherwise specified.
,,Great views!,4.0,,Stunning views. Get to go right to the top. Very beautiful. Highly recommend was a lovely day out. Get a combines ticket. Although keep in mind queues are long for tickets. Defo recommend the shuttle in hot weather.

,,Singapore 5 Day Visit,5.0,,"Part of the Marina Bay Gardens (free entry), Cloud Dome and Flower Dome well worth a visit S$28 (£16) for both. Spent half morning and all afternoon in them."
,,Real forest feel,5.0,,Cloud forest is within one of the two domes of the whole Gardens by the Bay complex. There is a high waterfall that provides mist to the plants and looks amazing to kids and adults. An elevator brings you up to highest point of the dome to get a breathtaking views of Singapore and look down onto the tops of the forest trees and plants.There is a winding metal that you walk along to get back. It's a surreal feeling as you look through the grid as if walking on air over the trees. Amazing plants so skilfully placed. Just great experience. Must do list.

,,A MUST see,5.0,,Spectacular vistas inside and its air conditioned! Do the outside gardens first then this one to escape the heat!
,,My favourite bit about the gardens,4.0,,I love the idea of this conservatory and the fact that it spreads people out makes it more enjoyable. When I was in the flower conservatory it was just really busy whereas this allows for a more spacious trip. I loved being up high and walking down with the flowers and waterfall. The video on conservation really hits home as well.
,,Very mysterious and beautiful,5.0,,One of the places that must visit when you are at the gardens by the bay. Its very beautiful and there are some rare carnivorous plants. The waterfall is spectacular and the secret garden really gives a mystique feel towards the end of the conservatory.
,,Magical,5.0,,"Absolutely loved this place. They have actually recreated the tropical environment that exists in a forest, including a huge waterfall. Everything is perfect to the T. This place cannot be missed. Go here in the evening around sunset and it's more beautiful"
,,Charming man made natural environment,5.0,,"This is a good place to visit and you may find a feel tranquillity..But if you are in a country in tropical and filled with nature,you may find it nothing to amaze..:)"
,,"If your kid loves waterfalls, here's one you must visit",5.0,,It is quite windy at the spot near where the water lands. The roaring sound of water with the sight of water falling from great height will surely mesmerise both adults and children
,,Def. a must to go,5.0,,"This Observatory is definitely worthy to paid. Love the falls just behind the entrance! Though the bridges, we can actually see the whole fall from behind. Good place for having a tea as well!"
,,Pure beauty,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a vital part of the whole Gardens by the bay complex.

,,Amazing place to cool off,5.0,,"Absolutely unbelievable to see, the waterfall is amazing. Really informative, especially the video about global warming at the end. A great way to cool off in the heat (they're air conditioned nicely)"

Just walk and indulge in nature with relaxing sound of the waterfalls. Yes! They do have an indoor waterfalls! The selection of plants from all over the world is amazing. Don't miss to check out the place when in SG. After your walk in the forrest ne sure to go and try the icecream offered in the souvenir shop. They have exotic flavors such as White Rose.

,,Amazing,5.0,,A wonderful place ..a must visit ..and a picture at the entrance is also a must ..if you don't have a particular interest in flowers and planets ..you can skip the flower dome and just visit the cloud forest as it's much more interesting. .
,,Tropical paradise,5.0,,"If you are visiting Marina Bay, I would definitely visit this and the other dome. Wonderful vistas, lift up to the top and then walk ways down past the waterfalls and quite interesting geological displays as well as lovely and interesting plants. Be careful if you are asthmatic as it is quite humid and heavy atmosphere."
,,Nice Walk,4.0,,"In my opinion I would not pay to see this as we got it with a package is the only reason I went in

Is well kept and nice on a hot day to cool off other than that if you have a big interest in flowers then there's not much here"
,,Amazing indoor garden,4.0,,You can visit Cloud forest along with Gardens by the bay its actually part of that only when you walk past the large metal trees. Its a must visit and should keep aside 2-3 hrs for this attraction to cover. Walking distance from marina bay so once you're done with cloud forest handout at marina bay sands and malls around it.
,,Nature Lover - Be there,5.0,,Just amazing collection of flowers and plants.. Some are available in some season only - April to June.. Quite humid but worth a visit.
,,AMAZING MAN MADE INDOOR WATERFALL,5.0,,"Enjoy amazing view of he world's highest man made indoor waterfall. You will also appreciate the various type of plants. Challenges your fear of heights from the 7th level and look down beneath the trees, plants and waterfall. A must visit place when in Singapore."

The Cloud Forest Dome houses a manmade mountain with a waterfall, diverse plants, interesting exhibitions on each level and a walkway around the top of the mountain. Visitors exit via the ""Five Degrees"" exhibition with thought provoking predictions about what will happen to our environment if temperatures were to increase by five degrees and what we can all do to protect our planet,
Cloud Forest is completely wheelchair accessible."

,,Very Good,5.0,,Man created Natural cloud forest with waterfall and snow falling with clouds. Great attraction . Must visit
,,Must see,5.0,,The walk into the cloud forest was a sight to behold. The atomsphere inside changes suddenly and it is cool. Do not forget to go to the top and take a look at every floor.

,,awesome,3.0,,this is a good place for people or family who love the jungle or nature the place was so awesome etc
,,Interesting View,4.0,,"Its interesting to see how this indoor man made tropical forest is built. There is an awe factor as soon as you enter and the flowers + falls provide good photo op. It can be good to beat the hot singapore climate as the whole place is air conditioned. But once the initial awe wears off, there is nothing else to do there and you start to realize as much as it strives to, it cannot match the charm of a natural forest.

Top Tips:
- Do take a jacket, even if you have high cold tolerance, the shift in temperature is quite jarring from outside to inside."
,,A disappointment,3.0,,"Although the concept is really nice, the plants and vegetation are everything but exciting. Just a bunch of green plants. No special exhibits either."
,,WOW!!!!!,5.0,,The man made waterfall was jaw dropping amazing!! I couldn't believe what I was seeing in front of my eyes. It was just incredible. I was truly impressed. Overall I was surprised finding to like this dome better than the flows dome. It was just so well put together. It was really an amazing site to see this!
,,A nice garden walk,4.0,,This is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex and one of two 'domes' you pay to enter. It is very nice with a walk through area including an inside waterfall.
,,Great,3.0,,Well worth a visit. This is an amazing place. But it is expensive as always in Singapore. Easy to get to and very well maintained and organised. Not far from orchid gardens and marina bay sands complex.

,,Exotic Surpise,5.0,,"On a steamy day in Singapore, walking into this air conditioned paradise was just perfect. From the get go you are impressed by the waterfall dominating the skyline. The walk around the artificial mountain, looking at the stunning range of flower and trees, really transported you to another world. We were happily surprised that the exhibit continue higher and higher up the mountain. You really feel like you get your money's worth from this attraction."
,,A 24hr stopover,4.0,,"This was a great place even when it's raining it can be accessed. If you a fan of plants, horticulture and wooden carved sculptures you will love this gigantic green house. Fun for kids also.

People who are very afraid of heights will not enjoy this as much."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Loved this dome. Reminded me of home but the best thing was the huge water fall and the display seemed to just keep going.
Only thing you need to know is it is not hot. Actually very cold compared to outside. Bring a long sleeved top."
,,Amazing show of nature,5.0,,"This is a must see attraction and not to be missed, lot of things to see.one can sense the rush of cool air once you enter.One is transported to a different world."
,,Great forest place,4.0,,"Good for a chill walk around the various rain forest flora. Remember to take some light jacket or something coz it is a bit chill inside. If like nature and plant - you will like it, but it will take you at least 1-2h to enjoy it."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is one of the two domes within the Gardens by the Bay attraction. It is a must see and takes at least an hour to go through, but it is well worth enjoying all the beautiful waterfalls and plants."
,,Wow. Wow. Lots of wow.,5.0,,"One of the things that will have me returning to Singapore is the gardens by the bay and the amazing domes. This cool-wet dome contrasts with the dry-cool of the flower dome. There are shades of green you may never have seen before and the array of plants is amazing. Don't be put off if you are not that interested in plants - it is way more than that. The suspended walkways, the views and the relaxing coolness will have you wanting to hang around and stay for a while. Do not miss this."
,,Impressive clever Lego garden,5.0,,"Allow yourself plenty of time to visit Cloud Forest. I spent several hours inside this one feature of Gardens by the Bay alone, where it was nice and cool with something new to see around every bend in the garden. I was really impressed with the Lego garden featuring carnivorous plant creations and even an impressive red back spider, which you don't notice immediately but can see it quite clearly if you view the garden from the side. Whoever created this garden is a genius. It has been very cleverly designed and you need to spend time looking at it from different angles to get the full impact of the display. Take the time to visit. Entry from ground floor opposite food kiosk. You wont be disappointed."
,,loved this with my wife,5.0,,"the waterfall was amazing, we had a lovely walk,, avoid lift and take the stairs you lazy people,, mist is magical and a must do in singapore"

,,Taking a morning walk,5.0,,This is one attraction must visit. There are a lot of things to see. If you are bringing your children there remember bring an extra change so that they can play at the water park. They will really enjoy it. It's very easy to get there and you can spent a whole day. I really enjoyed my visit.
,,Very impressive and cool,5.0,,"In the Cloud Forest Greenhouse, there is a gigantic waterfall and lots of orchids. Beautiful plants could be discovered while walking down, along the suspended walkway. The temperature in the dome is much lower than outside due to the waterfall, it is a relief from the heat and is most pleasurable."
,,A manmade marvel!,5.0,,"When you enter for the first time, you will be greeted by the gigantic waterfall. As the water falls, the droplets of water forms a mist. The feeling of walking through such a cool place in a hot tropical country like Singapore is truly wonderful.

As one goes up, one will notice flora which is supposed to correspond to the flora found at various altitudes on a mountain.

Finally, at the lowest section, one will be surprised by the fact that the cooling of both gardens is actually done with technology which is carbon emission free."
,,Stunning experience,5.0,,"This is a very special place to visit, especially on the hour when misting takes place under the whole dome."

,,We loved it!,5.0,,If you like nature and plants you must visit the Cloud forest. Very comfortble inside with a lot of explanation panels. Don't miss when mist is released. Get information about it in advance. We stayed much longer then we have expected.
,,love the mist!,5.0,,"My Aunt visited us from Australia for 3 days. And we could say that we've made the right choice for visiting Gardens by the bay. We truly enjoyed the conservatories. Both attraction have entrance fee. But its truly worth it! we enjoyed the mist at the water falls! It gives us the feeling that we are in a different place! Its actually +5 degrees! The top view was amazing as well! If you are bringing your kids along, make sure to feed them first because going in because there's no food and drink allowed."

Well laid out and forming part of the Gardens on the Bay. Short walk from City Centre and with benefit of a road train on the site

,,a touch of a tropical garden right by the MBS Hotel,5.0,,"Great experience , also a awesome place to get out of the heat! Its an amazing tropical garden in a architectural masterpiece building .... a must on your SINGAPORE visit"
,,Don't miss this experience,5.0,,"Whilst at Gardens by the Bay we were curious about the Cloud Forest so decided to purchase tickets just as the misting was about to start. On entering this area we were instantly relieved to be in a much cooler environment (it was hot on the day we visited the gardens) so the cool air was relief.
Once the misting started it was magical as you could see the mist forming clouds in the domed area. Walking to the top of the dome was a great experience as you got to experience the mist from the bottom level all the way to the top of the ramp.
Definitely add this to your list of things to do when in Singapore - especially on a hot day as it provides a cool relief from an otherwise sizzling day."
,,Maginificent,5.0,,It is a must visit as part of gardens by bay. It is magnificent to visit and see the forest and waterfalls.
,,Attractive indoor gardens and large indoor waterfall,4.0,,"Interesting display of indoor gardens, flowers and quirky animal carvings to please the children and photo seekers.

Educational for those interested in climate change impact and going green"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,The Cloud Garden is worth a visit. Coming from beautiful New Zealand (the most beautiful country in the world) it wasn't jaw dropping amazing. But this attraction has been done well and I can see that it would appeal to those who have not experienced a sub tropical rain Forrest or natural caves.
,,cloud Forest,5.0,,"This glass house is totally amasing, the plants, building and design This is a must visit in Singapore"
,,it surely is a must see in singapore,5.0,,this amazing garden is surely a must see in singapore - its a great break from the heat outside also
,,MUST DO WHEN IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,See my other review about the Marina Bay gardens. Stunning and breathtaking. The cloud forest was a definite favourite. Some very high viewing towers and pathways up to the top so people with vertigo might find it distressing ad the paths which absolutely sound and safe are made of solid steel they are not for those with a fear of heights. Stunning views down and around for everyone else though!
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Didn't know much about this before I went to Singapore but was blown away by the waterfall and the whole exhibition. The Flower Done, next door, was also wonderful"

,,Must visit place,5.0,,Very spectacular indoor gardens. The waterfalls when you first walk in are nice. This is a must visit tourist place. Take your time and easily spend 2-3 hours enjoying the beautiful gardens.
,,Flower Dome gets more raves but Cloud Forest is more educational,3.0,,"Interestin,g but if you live in Singapore, not too different from a walk in any of our nature reserves (except for the waterfall). The best part is the educational section that covers climate change, rising world water levels, world population levels, etc. Be sure to stop and read the facts here. Riveting. Bring the family and discuss with your children mankind's role in nature."
,,Great if not scared of heights!,5.0,,"Lovely and cool inside with the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. Take the lift to the top, come down by escalators to each level, each with a theme, cave, viewing platform , walkway etc. buy tickets for this and flower dome together to save."

,,Amazing,5.0,,The cloud forest is very unique and may Be one if it's kind the theme is very nice the idea is fabulous gives natural look and the forest in the dome that to with water fall ir idea beyond imagination of common man
,,Enjoyable 2 hours,4.0,,You can get an mrt or taxi to the front where you buy tickets which is SG $16 per person. Best shot is at the start where you see the full waterfall. Lots of flowers and plants and the +5° room was good to Open people's minds. After seeing the waterfall you take a lift right to the Top and work your way down. Kids might be a little bored here.
,,From Mountain Top to Tree Top,5.0,,"After admiring the ""waterfall"", head straight to the Lost World & work your way down, from mountain walk to tree top walk.

To my surprise, most of my visitors prefer Cloud Forest to the Flower Dome.
They feel that the layout is much more streamlined.....and love the foliage with surprising bursts of flowers. It gets misty too.

Try to come here with shoes with good grip, and a jacket/cardigan or shawl ....as it gets pretty cold here."
,,Must see!! Spectacular if you love plants,5.0,,Beautiful if you enjoy nature! The area around this is lovely. Our hotel suggested we wear a jacket but we did not need it. There are waterfalls that you can go into if you want to get wet but you can also do this this with out a drop of water. Don't miss the video at the end that explains the changes occurring in the world today and what we can do about them.
,,Stunning,5.0,,We all enjoyed our visit to Cloud Forest. So much to see to your own pace. This place is well worth the visit.
,,Fabulous Forest,5.0,,"Main atttaction is a 35-meter mountain covered with various flora that grows hundreds and thousands of meters above sea level. The mountain has a waterfall attraction - awesome scenery both from ground up and from the top.

I enjoyed the different mountain views as you walk around the mountain using hanging walkways. You will get to see diverse vegetation and wild flowers that are abundant in tropical highlands.

The cloud forest also makes a good attempt at educating people of the effects of climate change and global warming.

You will definitely enjoy this attraction. I suggest you take your time walking, viewing the forest and reading the explanation at each main area."
,,Interesting place worth a visit,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the bay site, easy to spend an hour or so walking round. Nice and cool compared to oustide"
,,A must see!!!,5.0,,"Wow! We loved the cloud forest!
It is so beautiful to see in person and magnitude of the man made mountain is incredible.
It nice and cool inside and when you first walk in you walk through the mist of the waterfall.
So many colourful, beautiful flowers and plants to see, even if you are not into that kind of stuff normally. Lots of great photo opportunities!!! There are two walks you can do and both are worth it.
I enjoyed this a little more than the Flower Dome (which was also great)
Highly recommend seeing in person for yourself!!!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Entry payable in advance or on day 28S$ for entry to both domes well worth it day or night light show amazing and free
,,Amazing,5.0,,A must see sight for anyone visiting Singapore. The variety of plants and trees are amazing along with the sculptures from driftwood which are brilliant.
,,Can't Miss Attraction,5.0,,"This is an indoor garden and a large waterfall, naturally cooled by the complexes water collection system. There are various vistas to be taken in, at different levels of height. Some of the coolest are seeing the closeness of the greenery with cityscapes in the background. At the end there is an informative movies about the trends of global warning.

The one aspect that might be overrated is the ""misting,"" which happens every two hours. We made an extra trip to come back for it, and it really wasn't that impressive."
,,Must visit at least once,4.0,,You would be awed with ingenuity of those who conceptualised this and the sheer diversity of flora and fauna will overwhelmn you
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is one of the most amazing man made structures i have ever been too. Truly breath taking. You won't be disappointed.
,,Great garden with air conditioning,5.0,,"A must come place in Singapore. After you finish visiting the trees garden you walk a couple of minutes and you are right there.
The first thing you fell when you enter the place is a great relief from the hot and warm outside weather, and the first sight of the water from the falls in front of you.
Nice walk, relaxing and lots of plants and flowers, including a collection of Tulipans. Must visit"
,,Cloud forest?,3.0,,The best part of this visit for me was the sense of fresh air compared with the mugginess of downtown. The wall plantings were lovely and I enjoyed the Lost World section on the upper level. Perhaps I went too late in the day as there was not a hint of mist. The giant tree ferns on the lower level looked to be struggling (fronds browning ) possibly too warm for them? Perhaps more could be done to mask the expanses of concrete. It was sad to see some beautiful big stalagmites and stalagtites displayed in a dull concrete space. I was pleased to learn that the entry fees went towards maintaining the Gardens.
,,Mind blowing attraction,5.0,,"Spent a few hours enjoying this mind blowing place, keep walking around struck by how incredibly awe inspiring the Cloud Dome is. It takes you through a whole gamut of emotions as you wondering around with your mouth open. Showing you what a real cloud forest would be like and all the plants that grow there."
,,Nature's Retreat,5.0,,"In the Cloud Forest, it is amazing how they have managed to have such a variety of trees and plants yet blend them into one seemingly natural habitat for your viewing.

With relative comfort air-conditioning and detailed signage of the exhibits, you can slowly stroll through the route just taking in the view or taking notes of the assortment of plants and trees.

A real nature's retreat in the middle of Singapore's bustling lifestyle as well as a good indoor activity for bad weather."
,,Brilliant. Such variety.,5.0,,"Just a great idea. Stunning. Easy to get to and easy to get around. Whole family will love it. Amazing wood carvings hidden all over the place. Bit chilly, but very tolerable."
,,Avatar-resk,5.0,,You feel like you're on the set of Avatar walking up this vertical rainforest. It is stunning and a welcome respite from Singapore's heat. There's some educational exhibits along the way too. Highly recommended.
,,Enjoyable walk,3.0,,Nice walk through the cloud forest attraction as part of our visit to The Gardens By the Bay. A lot of walking which some of the group struggled with.
,,nostalgic walk,4.0,,"For someone who grew up in the Philippines, it was quite nostalgic as the plants/trees found here were in our garden."
,,Is it really on Earth,5.0,,"Don't afford to miss it. Best of the best places to visit. Please visit during afternoon time so that you can escape outside heat. Entire dome is chilled. Magnificent architecture.

See the mist timings and try to be at top during the time mist is released. You will really feel you are in clouds. Need atleast 2-3 hours to enjoy. Great place to hang around. After coming out do visit flower dome as they are in same premises but different entry and separate tickets needed."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Absolutely amazing how they have recreated a natural environment inside the dome. It really feels like your walking amongst the trees at one point and the waterfall was also spectacular. A must see attraction in Singapore.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Just a fabulous and fantastic place! How people can compare with a nature to build such an amazing place: giants trees, fresh air, beautiful flowers and plants, relaxing music- just a paradise:)"
,,entering another world,5.0,,"when you enter cloud forest, it feels like entering a new whole world. you have to climb in to world lost treasure. you will fall in love, trust me ;)"
,,Amazing and unique,5.0,,Really unique place plenty of amazing vistas and with a futuristic look that I loved. It can get a bit crowded so take your time to let the crowds pass it is worth it.
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,You probaply won't find any as green and divergent inside garden anywhere! It's a very humid place and matched perfectly with rainy outside weather.. It's must see!
,,Expect the unexpected!,5.0,,The Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay was an amazing surprise as we were not expecting the area to be so scenic! The walk ways were amazing with lovely green plants and pretty flowers. The sound of the waterfall filled the whole space which made it feel so special. Definitely worth a visit!
,,Awesome experience !! Amazonian feeling!,5.0,,The way it has been set up in the city like Singapore is wonderful. You will feel like you are in a different world. Fun time assured!
,,Amazing,5.0,,It made you feel like you were out in the forest not inside. Very true to life.There was a surprise at every turn.
,,Family Holiday,5.0,,Beautiful spot well worth any trip Nice and cool when you get inside the mist and the waterfalls are stunning .
,,amazing waterfall and a very serene place,5.0,,if you want to experience a nice splash of water with great atmosphere and greenery around this is the place to visit
,,Amazing,5.0,,The first thing u notice about cloud forest is it's amazing amazing architecture and the elaborate thought process which must have gone behind the same. It is another one of those experiences where you just can't stop saying wow on each floor. Some great art work is showcased here and the cloud forest itself offers a spectacular sight.
,,Stunning undercover displays,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest has wonderful displays, all covered by a giant dome. Built with a lot of height, you can walk along the the walkways high in the dome, with superb displays wherever you look. Cascading waterfalls, excellent colour and foliage, and very well maintained. A highlight of Singapore."
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"My Favourite dome at the Bay cos it simulates a cloud forest which I will never experience ! It simulates the environment of a forest high in the mountains as high as the clouds are . You get to see the flora of such a forest ! It's an exhilarating experience every time, for me to walk up the different levels in the misty couldlike environment created in this dome.!!! Love it !!"
,,Unique indoor garden,5.0,,"This is a mesmerizing place, with an almost ethereal quality to it. The air-conditioned interior of this greenhouse provides a cooling retreat from the hot Singapore weather."
,,Not for me...,3.0,,I appreciate the work involved but it just wasn't for me. Probably a great place to go if you have children with you. Not a place I would go back to.
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,One of the best kept and nicest places to go in Singapore. Good to cool down too from the humid temperatures!
,,"In my opinion, the better of the two gardens.",4.0,,"There are some absolutely fantastic photo opportunities and visually impressive set ups but i would say that the information in this garden is not as impressive. Some of the sections are quite boring if you have gone there to learn and it is more of a garden to walk through and enjoy in my opinion.

Surprisingly cooler than the typical heat of Singapore and a very refreshing walk through."
,,Good place to take rest (&walk),5.0,,"I could to see lots lots of flowers and trees which is well organised and explained. There I could feel amazing atmosphere.
Only there was fee escalator, if you are with baby in baby stroller, want to stay longer in flower dome. Here you need to take lift floor by floor. (If you are holding the baby no problem!).
Anyway Want ti visit again.!!"
,,Cloud Forest,4.0,,"If you are limited for time , I would give this one a miss. I enjoyed it ,but there were others I enjoyed better ,like the orchids etc, vertical gardens."
,,WOW,5.0,,You must pay to enter but it's worth it. The waterfall and the walk down is great. It's a great trip for the family. Has great views also.
,,WONDERFUL,5.0,,"its quite cold in this cloud forest, but well worth the visit, they way its been set out its just fantastic, I would recommend this to anyone"
,,Waterfall!,4.0,,This place is great! The waterfall that you see as you enter is a highlight. There is a lot of climbing and walking involved here.
,,Pixar meets rain forest,5.0,,"The venue from the outside is rather unassuming but inside holds a treasure trove of botanical, artistic and scientific wonders. It achieves something that the writers of Pixar managed to perfect of appealing to all age ranges and interests without the targeting of any single group being noticeable - one little example being the lego carnivorous plants mixed in with the real thing or the approach to education of the whole facility."
,,Fantastic tourist atteaction.,5.0,,Spent half an hour (we were running short of time) going to the top of the falls and down. The architecture is amazing and there are hundreds of species of flora. Its also air conditioned so we felt a bit cold with the water spray coming from the falls. I would recommend setting aside at an hour to look around this place. Would go again. It cost $20 -well worth the money.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Incredible plants and structures. Lucky to be there when they began the misting which starts from the top of the waterfall while they play haunting music. Not to be missed.
,,Cloud forest,4.0,,Huge dome conservatory with a suspended walkway from the top to the bottom - quite spectacular with an indoor waterfall and many trees and plants.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Brilliant setting, fantastic displays and amazing sculptures. Definitely worth doing the walk from the top down."
,,"Beautiful - greatly landscaped mix of plants, very impressive",5.0,,"some may say it is artificial, but it is beautifully designed and very very impressive. there is a huge collection of plants and its a very impressive creation considering the size, height. the plants vary a lot and are greatly mixed to avoid a boring experience.

i have been to a lot of tropical places, forests etc ... and this one is very impressive even though it's artificial. a must do, great experience."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,Add this to your visit with Gardens by the may for the complete experience. It is right next door and easy walking.
,,wow,5.0,,the best place in Singapore to visit.. it is a man made forest.. but u wil feel it like natural.. no words can explain the place.. but don't ever miss this place.. the water falls is excellent.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Been there with my family for a weekend getaway. We went to cloud forest and is totally mesmerized by the scenery. The waterfall and cooling weather is worth dying for. Extremely great for family short trip. I will love to return again in the future.
,,"Very interesting, but quite limited",4.0,,"We went here with about 30-40 minutes before we had to leave and were worried we wouldn't have enough time, but we did. More than enough. The stories, waterfall and flowers were all beautiful and interesting but if there were no other tourists you could be in and out, seeing everything in 25 min. The biggest downside are the mindless ""selfie"" army. Hundreds of people just stopping in the middle of walkways to take pics, with no coherence to the fact they are blocking multiple that people.... But I suppose when tou put something beautiful on display the masses will come and they will need to Instagram... So not much you can do about that :)"
,,Stunnnnnning,5.0,,Wow this place is stunning. It has every thing from a waterfall to plants to a wounded full Experience a must see.
,,Cloud Forrest,5.0,,"Amazing, definitely worth visiting especially on a hot day as the whole dome is airconditioned! The views and the plants on display are beautiful."
,,Awesome,5.0,,This is a must see whilst in Singapore. Take the time and visit the Skypark and the flower and cloud forest it's beautiful Go early to avoid the crowds
,,WONDERFUL ATTRACTION,5.0,,We went to gardens by the Bay and spent some time there seeing everything. The Cloud Forest was just wonderful and is a must to see. We really enjoyed our experience.
,,Great experience,5.0,,One of the best attractions in Singapore. Highly recommended during the misting times which gives you a rainforest experience. Bring a jacket along and look out for water ;)
,,Nice view,5.0,,"Very big and beautiful forest, must see attraction in the singapore, good spot to take photos, need ticket tp enter"
,,Forest under a huge dome.,5.0,,Such a beautiful place.. Visited this place after sunset n the lights around made it look even better... Artificially created forest with all natural plants.. A must visit place
,,Excellent views,4.0,,"Impressive architecture. Cool temperatures and frequent misting make this a great place to visit and cool off, especially midday. When clear, the views of the city are amazing."
,,A supreme attraction you should not miss.,5.0,,"A awesome place to visit. It is within the surroundings of the ""Garden of the bay"". The mist, the lighting, the waterfall and the round to the top walkway thrill you to a unforgettable experience."
,,Great way to escape the Singapore heat.,5.0,,Beautiful gardens and architecture. Great way to cool down and see interesting plants. The sky walk is great with excellent views of Singapore.
,,Well worth the extra ticket price,5.0,,Even if you're not big into gardening this place is worth a look. They have done an amazing job at combining local flora in the spectacular almost pre-historic setting.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Beautiful and amazing. You have to pay to get in but completely worth it! Highly recommend to go in and see the plants and do the walks.
,,An indoor rain forest,4.0,,"Be ready to get wet in this beautifully done up indoor rain forest where you can actually feel, see and experience the clouds and experience a rain forest. You can walk up and down the levels and then reach the tip for the best experience."
,,Not to be Missed,5.0,,Breathtaking! Enclosed inside this building is a waterfall dropping from the 35 meter mountain (That you can go up inside) completely covered with thousands of plants
,,Exceptional Experience,5.0,,"Taken out of the real world into a colorful artificial one. The dome is packed with interesting plants. Walkways that emerge and return to the side of a ""mountain"". Many levels to investigate. Hang onto the railings if you suffer from vertigo."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,The cloud forest was only a small part of the overall package visiting Gardens by the Bay .It was breathtaking ...absolutely loved it
,,Unexpected attraction,5.0,,"Much is said about Gardens by the Bay as a must see in Singapore. The 2 glass enclosed structures in addition to the Supertrees dominate the park. For me there seemed to be little in my reading beforehand to discriminate between the different attractions there. We went to the Flower dome first, and it was as expected, a nice nursery like place. The Cloud Forest, however, was a surprise to me in its scope and imagination. The plant covered ""mountain"" with wandering walkways was really one of the standout attractions in Singapore for me. It's almost like an amusement park ride. If I would have to pick out one thing to see in Gardens by the Bay, it would be the Cloud Forest."
,,Interesting but chilly!,4.0,,"The cloud forest was very cool to visit, literally. I would bring a scarf if you are easily chilled.
It is a neat place to visit, but looks a bit manufactured.
There were some similar orchids that you can see at the orchid section of the botanic gardens, but some different ones as well.
The sculptures and wood figurines are very beautiful.
At the end they have an educational bit on global warming and climate change."
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,When you are in the area don't miss the chance to visit this excellent variety of greens and flowers
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,It was busy but really worth it to see this amazing vertical garden in all its splendour. It is so breathtaking and cool would highly recommend it!
,,Must see,4.0,,Be ready to navigate through crowds. Make sure to got to top of fountain. Wear comfortable shoes cause the floors are wet due to splashes of water from the fountain.
,,Average,3.0,,"Average. Not awe-inspiring or anything. Maybe just cos I prefer more ""natural"" to man-made. The waterfall was too superficial for my taste. Over-rated for me, but a nice visit nonetheless."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. The tall waterfall is exhilarating and mesmerizing. The only setback is that the air conditioning is a tad too cold. Overall, it is a must to visit this place."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Magical another great attraction that Singapore offers they get it so right.Lots of beautiful plants and flowers.The views are breathtaking as you wind your way around.I dont like heights but managed this well as there is so much to enjoy you dont notice,well not to much.So glad we did it.Kids love it plus lift available for wheelchair. Dont miss it"
,,"If you are already there, might as well go in",3.0,,But don't plan a special trip to visit Cloud Forest or Flower Dome. They are overpriced and not that special.
,,Indoor rain forest,5.0,,Here you will be amazed at the variety of plants growing in this dome from the tropics to mountain plants a lift takes you to the top and an aerial walkway lets you discover the many different plants growing at certain times of the the day a mist of fine water spray creates a tropical mountain feel and you feel as though you are up in the clouds.A waterfall cascades down the'mountain' and many rare plants can be discovered growing on the mountainside An entrance fee is charged for this and it is well worth a visit.
,,Visually amasing,5.0,,"We were very impressed with this attraction, and were amazed by how it was all put together. Is certainly a must see as part of the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Well worth entry - especially during heat of the day!,5.0,,"Beautiful structure and we were really impressed. Great to be in here in the heat of the day and easily wasted an hour and a half wandering around.
Well worth the entry fee of 28SGD with the Flower Dome too. And Gardens by the Bay have great baby rooms for discrete breastfeeding and changing."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Cant belive how big this was and how interesting the visit was would definitely recommend a visit here
,,A must do if garden lover,5.0,,"Was on my bucket list and was not disappointed, well worth it, we went later in the day so not so crowed and then stayed for the sound and light show in the super tree grove."
,,Not worth it,3.0,,Was more or less draged to this place. Lovely building and nice with the cool air there. Otherwise not worth it.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens By the bay in front of Marina bay sands. The Man made waterfall is huge. You actually take a elevator to the top of the Mountain within the dome and walk down each level as you see different things.

Purchasing tickets beforehand is advisable to avoid long ques at the ticketing booth, especially on holidays

1 - 2 hours required to see this dome"
,,Very nice,4.0,,We found it very unique... they have made it so beautiful and can found lots of different trees and shrubs the waterfall is good and they provide lifts to go up and then can come down by slope... good... they taken care of everything also they shown a model which says how this garden is helpful for decreasing the pollution level in Singapore
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,This was one of the highlights to our trip to Gardens by the Bay. Very stunning and just refreshing in a crowded city.
,,Huge man made tropical rain forest with its own waterfall!,5.0,,The entire water cycle is re-created in front of us by this attraction. The interiors are cooled by the continuously churning water. There are 6 floors to this attraction and elevators are provided. The walkways offer fabulous views of the bay
,,Interesting for children at heart and kids,4.0,,"Nothing beats being out there in nature but this place does an okay job to simulate the mountains and the rainforest experience at least for a few minutes. Come here and talk to your kids about the beautiful nature that we all need to preserve, and then please find time and take your kids to real mountains somewhere because this won't do the job for you. The place gets really cold (a fully air-conditioned dome) so bring a light jacket if you're not used to winter."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Visited in August with my sister. We got our tickets from busonlinetickets (portal) and paid only $22 per person for entry to Cloud Forest & Flower Dome (which was cheaper than booking from the official website or buying at the entrance). Getting there was pretty easy, its 100-200m walk from the MRT at Marina Bay. The walking track to the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome is easy and busy, so you don't have to worry about safety, just make sure you wear comfortable shoes. The waterfall is plain amazing, getting to witness the mist spray and walking up and down the different levels were just mind-blowing. Again, there's quite a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes/flip flops. So much to see and experience; the plants, the fresh, cooling mist and the incredible structure, so enjoy yourself!"
,,Wow,4.0,,It has been quite spectacular and magnificent. I can honestly say that this is one of the unique style garden concepts I gave ever seen. It's an easy walk getting around the garden using the walkways.
,,What an Amazing Forest,5.0,,"OMG! I was so amaze and happy to visit it. Singapore have a wonderful cloud forest. Well worth a visit and even if you have one day in Singapore you should see this attraction. I would love to meet the minds behind this and the other attractions in this area. Wow. Stunning.

It's an easy walk getting around the garden using the walkways. Was not overly busy. We got there around 9am. There is a lift which takes you to the top where you can walk down using the walkways so not a strenuous activity.
I would rate this as one of the top five must dos in Singapore. Not expensive and just mind blowing in its sheer vision. Not for the faint hearted in parts but safe. You walk through a virtual fainforest created on a huge structure inside the glass dome with views to die for both in and out of the dome."
,,Beautiful architecture,5.0,,My family including two kids loved it! The walkway down from the top had amazing view of the surrounding city area too.
,,Wet!,4.0,,Cold and a little mysterious with the mist. Have to pay for entrance fee! Could also climb to higher levels to get a nicer view of the area.
,,Amazing walk,4.0,,"Beautiful views and walk. Nicely arranged green scenery, definitely worth a visit. I think it was accessible and an easy walk from Marina Bays."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Cloud forest is the home to the tallest indoor waterfall in the world and it's beautiful. It's kept at a lovely cooking temperature inside which is a nice break from the humid outside air. There's plenty to look at and lots of photo opportunities. You don't have to be a mad gardens enthusiast to enjoy the beauty here.
,,Enjoy the cool air,4.0,,"It is very relaxing to walk through the cloud forest and enjoying the cool air. At the top of the building, we can see the surround view of the island"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,Very impressive and relaxing atmosphere. The indoor water fall was great to see. It was great to get away from the Singapore heat and enjoy the cooling air con. Highly recommend!!
,,Magestic gardens,5.0,,"A beautiful garden on an epic scale, not for those who fear heights,as it is a long way up, but is a fantastic experience. A unique garden that is definitely worth a visit"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"This is such a unique place, located amongst so many other amazing attractions. There's just so much to see and take in. Don't miss it'."
,,One Drop of Water,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is part of Gardens by the Bay. It is such a wonderful place to discover how important water is to us and how we need to pay more attention to its use and misuse. Go to the top and experience being above the falls and the beauty emerging from the mist.
,,Do Not Miss,4.0,,The Cloud Forest is a wonderful architecture design and I really like the place. The view is the most important point.
,,Forrest in the City.,5.0,,"It has been quite spectacular and magnificent. It is a nice place to be, especially when outside is 30+ degree."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The doom is extremely clever with its design and impressive. I missed seeing this on my last visit and was No 1 priority on this visit and it did not disappoint. I love my flowers and the orchids are stunning. The carvings are also a surprise and have you looking twice to see what else has been carved out - not just one piece. The waterfall is also a lovely sight careful not to get wet. To be able to walk around this doom and enjoy all it has to offer is so special. I DONT like heights but it is very safe. I wish my own country could build something so special has this ????
,,Definitely a Must Go!,5.0,,"Worth the money! A greatly constructed and informative time spent. It's also good to plan this in between outdoor activities, as the air conditioning is superb!"
,,"Wow, overwhelming stunning and amazing",5.0,,"Singapore always surprises me with its amazing gardens but this blew us away. I can honestly say that this is one of the unique style garden concepts I gave ever seen. The concept itself, the detail, the art, the plants, the walkways, the water falls and pools, the views, everything about this place blew me away.

Well worth a visit and even if you have one day in Singapore you should see this attraction. I would love to meet the minds behind this and the other attractions in this area. Wow. Stunning.

It's an easy walk getting around the garden using the walkways. Was not overly busy. We got there around 9am. There is a lift which takes you to the top where you can walk down using the walkways so not a strenuous activity.

We took many many photos and will certainly relay stories about this place to all who will listen."
,,Mind blowing!,5.0,,"This is the only dome out of the two, that is a must visit at the Gardens by the Bay.

The Rainforest makeover is so splendid that she'll leave you in awe. Complete with a huge waterfall and immense flora and found this one is pretty amazing. Don't miss it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I would rate this as one of the top five must dos in Singapore. Not expensive and just mind blowing in its sheer vision. Not for the faint hearted in parts but safe. You walk through a virtual fainforest created on a huge structure inside the glass dome with views to die for both in and out of the dome. The plants are well tended and the whole experience can take two to four hours depending how long you linger. Just the place on a hot Singapore day.
,,"Not a gardener, but WOW !!",5.0,,"We visited on a humid day and the first thing was the cool environment, but then you have a look at what you've walked into. Theres the highest indoor waterfall (amazing) then there's the flowers and displays, orchids of every kind and all stunning, displays with colours that hurt your eyes. Many levels to visit and all wheelchair friendly.. I'm still not a gardener but have a whole new appreciation of gardens and the cloud forest would be the worlds ultimate garden. Very cool and very very cool."
,,excellent walk,5.0,,"enjoy a walk through the different levels, plenty to see. see the waterfall from top to bottom and in between"
,,Incredible place!,5.0,,I love this place and everybody who will be in Singapore should visit Cloud Forest ! I recommend this place!
,,Amazing,5.0,,The entire park is a must visit. The cloud forest is an amazing architectural beauty as well as its inhabitants.
,,Must visit experience,5.0,,"Great enviroment where you can enjoy every aspect of the cloud forest. Enjoy beautiful flowers, waterfalls and a high dose of oxygen!"
,,Wonderful feeling,5.0,,Its wonderful feeling when you walk through the the water splashing falling from a great height.you enjoy walking right up to the top and see how the water is falling from a great height.You also see a mist that is created.while coming down walking you can see a beautiful view and click good memorable photos
,,Clever design,4.0,,"This doom has very special architecture design, extremely high ceiling (clear see through) meanwhile you are able to walk to the TOP and see various green plants. But for those who has acrophobia/afraid of height might reconsider to get in.

Another I visited this iCloud before, but after 6pm. Honestly even it's open until 9 pm, nothing much you can see at night. It's better try to get in before dark or around 5 pm."
,,Wonderful orchids ! Amazing carvings !,5.0,,"Wonderful orchids ! Amazing wood carvings ! Check that and look around, there are carvings you won't see, when you don't look clearly. This dome is so wonderful and time consuming."
,,It was amazing!,5.0,,"Loved the Cloud Forest. The walk ways, the plants, the architecture - all stunning. And what a display at the entrance - takes your breath away! Photo moments everywhere."
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,The gardens have been designed by experts from around the world. There are a wide abundance of flowers and trees as well as beautiful sculptures and masks from Papua New Guinea
,,Artificial nature touristy place,4.0,,"In Singapore we don't Have the luxury of 4 Seasons , so this is where you go , to look at flowers . And take some pictures :) Was okay . First time there . Fully air conditioned indoor green house kinda thing ."
,,Fascinating Place,5.0,,Beautiful dome within Gardens by the Bay. Well worth a visit. The scale of the waterfalls need to be seen to be appreciated. Great experience.
,,WOW,5.0,,A fantastic concept and lots to see on both the ground and higher up 'above the clouds'. Fascinating features and a spectacular waterfall. Price of the ticket includes access to the other pod with flowers from around the world!
,,An amazing experience!,4.0,,"Go, see the world.. all within one huge glass dome - two if you include its sister dome. Go from tropics to alpine climates as you climb what is an amazing vertical garden."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"Love this the most during my visit in singapore.
We were greeted by the man made waterfall after the entrance.

Like how they have planned the people flow, you take the lift to the top floor and spiral down using escalators.

They also offer multiple entries on the same day, just get a re-entrance chop."
,,Beautiful architecture to showcase the flowers/trees,4.0,,Excellent way to pass a hot afternoon enjoying nature in an air condition enclosure. visit on weekdays (non public holidays) to avoid noisy crowd and long queues from tourists.
,,nice cooling greenery,5.0,,beautiful foliage of greenery in a cool environment. enjoy a slow stroll and take memorial pictures too
,,Cool when outside is humid,5.0,,"Singapore's afternoon experiencing hot sun and humid, this is a good place to hide. Man-made water fall creates some cooling effect."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"A must see. Accessible to everyone, young and old, and with very abilities. Might be a bit of a challenge if you're afraid of heights. I'm not too keen, but managed. it was worth the effort."
,,Love the walkways feature!,5.0,,"Allow about an hour for this stunning place because there's so much to see and enjoy here. There's a lift to the top then an interesting array of elevated walkways. We recommend a weekday or other time when there are likely to be fewer people. We got our tickets at the entrance, with scarcely a queue (instead of buying on-line)."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Extremely beautiful. Peaceful. Serene. A walk thru the rainforest with beautiful butterflies fluttering and the mist created every 2 hours makes it a must visit.
,,Can skip to the other dome,2.0,,"Having been to the flower dome, we have high expectation on cloud forest before going in. But to our disappointment, we could not see anything far more interesting than flower dome. At the entrance, there is a giant man made waterfall which sent water vapor pouring down from above. There are plants every where but handful of flowers, so don't expect to see lots of flowers here. No wonder it was called cloud ""forest"". Elevated pathways all around the dome, but serious paying so much to see some man made plants was not worth the value. For us we won't go in for 2nd round to cloud forest. So if possible just skip this cloud forest and head to flower dome instead."
,,Very nice to see,5.0,,"Most awe inspiring place to be in, perhaps in the whole of Singapore. Because of the nice fake climate, the beautiful waterfall, the water splashing everywhere, and the noise of ""nature"" louder than humans."
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"What a wonderful place. Amazing really when you think of the thought that went into creating such a spectacle. A great day out for the family, with wonderful attractions. Plan to spend at least 3 hours here soaking it all in!"
,,Love it !,5.0,,This is the best of Gardens by the Bay Totally spectacular and a must see The thought behind this attraction is stunning Highly recommend
,,It's really worth a visit!,4.0,,"It is quite surreal to see the same types of shrubs and trees here in the Cloud Forest as when we were hiking up in the mountains in Patagonia! In fact when I saw those plants in Patagonia, it reminded me of the Cloud Forest back home in Singapore. I always recommend a visit to this place (and of course Gardens By The Bay) whenever I have friends from overseas visiting Singapore."
,,Cloud Forest Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This was spectacular, the only gardens to better this is the Buchart Gardens in Victoria BC. Nice and cool walking platforms up to the top of the cloud. Friendly staff"
,,Wondeful,5.0,,"Visited with my grandchildren, and we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A very informative and educational experience. The cloud area at the top of the exhibit was quite thrilling, to be in an environment that replicated the mountain tops was superb."
,,fantastic,3.0,,"It gives a nice feeling of the rain forest, lots of plants and nice walk to the top and also nice views of the city of Singapore"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Totally awesome. $28 for this and the flower dome. Crazy walk past waterfall, sculptures. Then catch an elevator up to the top where there's a suspended walkway!"
,,Cool,5.0,,It has a windy feeling and has an elevator inside. It feels as if I am in a dreamy atmosphere. Be sure to bring your jacket as it is very cold.
,,Absolutely Stunning!,5.0,,"Spent the day starting with the Flyer, moving on to the Bay Sands SkyDeck, the Floral Dome and ended in the Cloud Forest.

From the moment of entering it truly has the wow factor. The path snakes up and around the simulated mountain structure with lifts for easy access if required. Everywhere you look there are plants and carvings to see. There are water falls and flowers galore and a very informative film show on the ground floor describing the potential impacts of +5 degrees warming on the planet.

Plenty of staff around if you need help, lots of rest rooms and very clean - no rubbish anywhere.

This is a 'must do' in our opinion. We paid S$28 per head entry which included both the Flower Dome and this Rain Forest attraction. We thought the Eden Project in the UK was good - this beats that in our opinion."
,,Had fun,4.0,,Was interesting walking around the winding trail which led up to the top and seeing all the different plants. The timber sculptures carved from natural tree shapes we pretty amazing. The only downfall was the entry fee was way to expensive.
,,Beautiful man made forest,4.0,,Very beautiful waterfalls and cooling... lots of begonia species.. my favourite plants . Growing so beautifully and big
,,Awesome.,5.0,,"Great variety of plants, trees and other more unusual vegetation. Especially loved all the pitcher plants. Probably took us at least two hours to go through."
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,This is truly a unique experience. The waterfall as you first enter is amazing to see. The flying walkways as you make your way down the mountain give a real birds eye view of the mountain. Ann added bonus it is lovely and cool in very warm part of the world
,,Beautiful indoor forrest,5.0,,Absolutely stunning indoor gardens. Great photo opportunities. Definitely worth a visit. Also very educational about rainforests and climate change.
,,See some magnificent waterfalls,5.0,,These falls drop from the top of this tropical garden with lovely trees and shrubs. There are viewing points at many levels and surprisingly my tendency to vertigo did not manifest itself - probably as high regard for spectator safety made me feel totally confident. It is possible to walk up the curved walkway to the top of the falls OR take a series of lifts so fine for the fainthearted but there were not too many places to sit. I went with some local relatives who were as excited by the surroundings as I was. Singapore is justly proud of this relatively recent development.
,,Unique And Stunning,5.0,,"What an original, interesting place. We spent half a day here and even my teenager enjoyed it. Lots of walking, but all of it is through beauty. It smells devine in here and the foliage is just beautiful."
,,Lunchtime visit,5.0,,"Great attraction just next to marina bay sands, beautifully laid out not too busy and well air conditioned. An abundance of flowers, cactus, plants from around the globe. Worth the extra to do the sky walk! Plenty of loos and places for drinks, great waterfall. Evening must be amazing with the light show."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Relaxing, cool escape from the heat outside. Interesting and thought provoking. Highly recommend. The art pieces dotted throughout the dome were striking."
,,Just do it!,5.0,,Must do it! Just magical. Great for everyone! I would love to take my parents back here! It has such a magical feel that makes you excited so see what's next!
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Wasn't expecting much, but it is really cool and the plants and high walkways with all the scenic outlooks were beautiful and unexpected."
,,Great Place,5.0,,Definitely enjoyed every moments that we got when inside this special place. Waterfalls inside was truly awesome. Spent 2 hours.
,,CLOUD FOREST IN SUBURBIA,4.0,,We visited the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay recently - what a surprise to find such a magnificent garden setting inside the middle of a city. The variety of plants to view is excellent. Getting around the Cloud Forest is very easy. This attraction is great to visit for a cool down on a hot day.
,,Fantastical!!!,5.0,,"Loved it - creativity and imagination have created a really wonderful environment for all these fabulous plants. There are waterfalls and magical wooden carvings, there are walkways and waterfalls, there are colours and perfumes and it is exciting. I really did think it was amazing and am so glad we visited. To top our visit there were delightful students from a local high school doing a survey for their exam work - it allowed us to rave about their country and these wonderful tourist attractions!"
,,tall waterfall inside a green building with tropical flora!,5.0,,"The most amazing collection of tropical plants! The indoor waterfall has a great view from top. Don't miss the mist! It's cold inside, remember to carry a light jacket/cardigan."
,,Wonderful experience!,5.0,,"We loved visiting the cloud forest! We are from the states and don't have anything there like this. We loved being able to take a guided tour or walk on our own. We chose to walk on our own, so that we could go at our own pace. Definitely a favorite of Singapore!"
,,Nice,5.0,,Wasn't originally on our plans for Singapore but so glad we did this one. Look around for a package as you might get a better deal on entry. If your not into heights there's still lots to see and experience.
,,Well worth the visit - you wont be disappointed.,5.0,,"I first saw this just after the Gardens were finished, and they were still adding the broms and orchids up the side of waterfall. They are still doing this but it is still a marvel and definitely and Must See"
,,This was part of Garden by the bay tour.,5.0,,Nice place. The waterfall is excellent. Kids learnt about stalactites and stalagmites. Walking down the artificial mountain was fun. Hanging bridges / walkways were exciting for the kids.
,,Don't worth it,2.0,,"It's a really strange place. When you get in it's cold because of air conditioning. You think you going to experience some forest but no. It's just a garden in leves. They don't even let you decide where to go. They direct you all the way long. Inside the ""garden"" it's just concrete, you can see the building. They didn't have the caring of make a garden inside. It's just to look nice outside the dome. Inside it, it was a total disappointment. And in the end they actually have some part of caves they brought somewhere in the world. It's totally a shame, or even a crime!! How they had the courage to remove part of a cave to put there. So out of place. Everything about this dome is out of place."
,,A wow place to see.,5.0,,"This was breathing in both size, diversity,colour and sheer engineering. So well thought out, an amazing amount of flora and surprisingly cool inside which was most welcome after the Singapore heat"
,,A vivid and enhanced experience of Earth now and before,5.0,,An amazing place in gardens by the bay to enjoy a refreshing visualization of fresh waterfalls and vegetation at different heights as well as videos of earth now and in the future. Has different levels with electrical staircases and elevators.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,One of the highlights of our visit to Singapore was this spectacular building. Think the Eden Project times ten. The plants were fantastic. Overwhelmingly amazing and well looked after plants.
,,Nice,4.0,,It is located within Garden of Bay. It is an artificial garden and air conditioned . Just amazing and a must do while in Singapore. I had never such thing before.
,,A must see.... paradise,5.0,,"its a one in a life time event.... it is beautiful and off course Singapore style very well looked after. You need time to see it, half a day is probably close to it... 10 / 10 for sure ."
,,A cool respite from the hot and humid Singapore weather,5.0,,"It is a good walk from the MRT station to get to the Cloud Forest dome, best to bring a bottle of cold water. We bought both tickets to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome at a discount. AirAsia, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines (may be other Asian airlines as well) got a promo and if you tell them which airline you used to fly in you get additional discount (15% I think). The exhibits inside the dome is very interesting and a good way to see the vegetation in a cloud forest without having to climb perilous mountains. The trip to the Cloud Forest brought back memories of my field days. The place is always packed with tourists even on weekdays, there's a lot of waiting for turns to take a photo. But take your time, you can do both tours in half a day. After the tour we headed back towards the direction of the MRT to Stay by the Bay where there are food stalls with more local varieties at very reasonable prices."
,,Ok,3.0,,When you walk in the falls were impressive. The rest was ok. Shouldve probably used the time spent there to visit something else. But irs not bad really if you have plenty of time.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The cloud forest is an amazing building, the flowers are spectacular. It just seems to go on and on with something even more beautiful at every turn"
,,good,4.0,,Very cold inside and nothing much to see actually. Just a tallest indoor waterfall and you get to walk along the walkway at the top and then back down again.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Loved the cloud forest! It was really nice and cool inside saved us from the outside humidity! It was absolutely beautiful inside!
,,OK for a rainny day,3.0,,"We only went there as it was raining and it is indoor attraction. I didn't expect much from it as I have been in similar place in the UK - Eden project- which in my opinion was much better. I was glad that I have read some reviews before our visit and took a jumper as it was very cold inside, otherwise I wouldn't enjoy my visit whatsoever. So be prepared. I would only recommend it on a rainy day or if you looking for place to cool down. I much enjoyed botanic gardens which are outdoor. We have visited both domes and in my opinion this was was better than flower dome."
,,Misty Day,5.0,,"I love this place when it's the time for the Mist. The place is so beautiful and good for relaxing. The temperature also quite cold, so beware if you can't stand of the weather."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"You will find and enjoy full day here with man made highest water fall Amazing forest with cloud environment and walk all the way the highest point by foot Even though lift is available,walk all the way to take pictures everywhere"
,,This is some structure.,5.0,,"This is one of these place that you cant miss. Truly wonderful place to spend a few hours, just walking above the treeline and going behind the waterfall and just being in the clouds. Its had to imagine that you are in a man made structure but that the whole thing about Singapore, its all manmade.

Dont miss this its stunning."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"After trekking round the disappointing flower dome, I didn't have high hopes for this one but how wrong was I. It was spectacular and worth every dollar of the entry fee. Loved the aerial walkway through the plants. You also get great views around the beautiful Gardens by the Bay."
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,The cloud forest was simply fabulous. The ecosystem was involved as well as beautiful. There is a cascading waterfall and plants make of legos. We take the elevator up to the top and walk down to view the entire structure.
,,W O W,5.0,,"This experience is amazing. A must see! The cloud Forrest is a dome filled with a mountain of flowers and moss. It's so cool to see when you first walk in, it's decorated with a water fall and lots of tribal statutes dotted around.
This experience allows you to understand how sustainable this new area of Singapore is. All the water is reused and the buildings are solar powered.
You can walk all around the mountain of flowers whilst surrounded by fog machines to act as the cloud, hence the name.

It's a wonderful thing to see, I recommend it. It took us about half an hour to 45 minutes to walk around fully whilst taking our time, it was worth it. And the tickets weren't took expensive for what you see."
,,Fascinating experience,5.0,,Great for kids and families. The views are beautiful and you can learn something. Combining high tech and nature. Cool stuff!
,,Exceptionally good..,5.0,,One can experience the nature at its best and it gives a feel like u are trekking in some hillstation.....vivid varieties of cactus and plants can be seen....perfect place to get selfies...nice cool experience on a hot sunny day.....recommended for nature lovers..
,,I know it's amazing but ..,3.0,,"This place has a massive indoor waterfall and thousands of exotic rainforest plants, as well as a canopy walk. Only a philistine could fail to give it a 5-star rating?
I try to be honest in my reviews. I absolutely loved the Gardens by the Bay overall. My favourite part was the Super Trees which are outside and free.
The Flower Dome was beautiful and had great sculptures. Undoubtedly the Cloud Forest cost a fortune to build and to run. However, at the end, I didn't feel that I had been somewhere that would live with me forever.
Plant lovers will be horrified but honesty is better than blindly giving it a top rating!"
,,Average,4.0,,"Cloud Dome is the most average part of Gardens by the Bay. Yes it has the indoor waterfall and the skywalk but thats basically what there is to do. It costs more if you go to either dome so better to book both domes together to save some money.

Do visit it but dont expect anything out of this world."
,,Not as nice as the other one,5.0,,The other dome is a lot nicer. Sadly cannot buy ticket for 1 only. Need 2. Beautiful place and worth the money
,,"Fascinating, educative and beautiful",5.0,,"The conservation message comes through strongly, but in a nice way, and the whole experience is very enjoyable."
,,Absolutely Mesmerising.,5.0,,We were here 3 years ago and this is even more lush now. Just wander and marvel at the tropical wonders. No need to spend more than an hour. Worth every penny.
,,A cool experience,5.0,,"It cost $16 a ticket. There was a deal whereas if you purchased tics for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome together, it was cheaper. We elected to do Cloud as the reviews on Trip Advisor seemed better for it.

This is a very large space, comprised of many levels, with elevators and escalators. Upon entering you are on a walkway which takes you through interesting plantings and then you come upon an elevator which takes you up to a higher floor. Then gradually you continue to go upward. At the top you can see a water garden with lots of orchids etc., then you enter onto the metal walkway and you are at the very top of the dome.

This walkway enables you to have scenic views of the harbor and some of the Supertree Grove trees outside. It is very high and if you have fear of heights, think twice. Every 2 hours, they do ""misting"" and mist comes out and looks pretty. It took a long time to walk down through the levels. There were gorgeous plants everywhere.

The air conditioning comes out of giant pipes embedded in the plantings and while I didn't need a sweater, it was nice and cool. All in all a lovely place, with waterfalls and lots to see. I highly recommend. I liked it very much."
,,Man made,4.0,,This artificial waterfall is another must see. Great photo opportunity. Be sure to explore the suspended walk path for great photo opportunity. Not good for those are afraid of height.
,,It's beautiful! Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"It's beautiful for those who love flowers. However, it's bit cold inside the the dome. So, do bring a jacket just in case."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Visited Singapore for 4 days and packed in so much. Cloud Forest was one of the attractions. Amazing how they have created this forest of waterfalls, trees, plants, orchids. So much to see. Climate changes as you got higher. So different and well worth a visit."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,WOW! This was simply an amazing place to visit and I will definitely go back. So much to see and the aerial walkway gives you amazing views inside the dome as well as out to the city. The waterfall is fantastic and later in the dome you get to see the top of the fall as well.
,,A good indoor experience for outdoor lovers,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is an amazing and unique experience in Singapore. It has a huge collection of plants and flowers and the tallest indoor waterfall in the world.
,,Wow,5.0,,Wow is only response when you enter in it. Waterfall gives you cool and beautiful feeling. When you walk through the way its fun to walk.
,,beautiful scenary,5.0,,this is a must see on your list. the cloud forest is spectacular and even more so when the misting is turned on. Take your camera for some amazing Orchid shots
,,Nice views,5.0,,"It´s a nice walk around the mountain watching all the flowers and waterfall, a very nice place for a first date."
,,A highlight in Singapore,5.0,,"Cloud Forest truly is the jewel in the crown of Gardens by the Bay. While Gardens by the Bay was somewhat underwhelming, Cloud Forest is a true wonder.

Beautifully realised and educational, this is a must-do in Singapore. Definitely go for misting which changes the experience and makes it ultra special. Just being there has made me consider my personal impact on the environment!"
,,Most beautiful green house I ever seen,5.0,,"A MUST attraction in Singapore. One of the two greenhouses in Gardens by the Bay. The green house itself is very nice air-conditioned which is great in hot weather. There is a largest indoor waterfall in the world. The house is full of trees and plant, most of them with flowers. Do not miss the way to the top with amazing view."
,,Mesmerising....,5.0,,"It was a place where you feel high, being so close to nature... Beautiful... I went crazy in there... didnot wanted to come out out of this... its just outstsnading... A must visit place..."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Astonishing place, a work of art and a feat of engineering. Educational, breath taking, more than I expected. Not enough superlatives. Refreshingly cool in the heat too, no picture can do it justice."
,,Chilling and prepare to get wet,4.0,,"Its ok for mimic-ing the waterfall but it could be more natural look. Nothing much to see than rainforest flowers and plants around. You have to walk from the top and going down there. If you are visiting there on certain time, it will misting and created a fog feeling but prepare to get wet after that. Something like 12.00 oclock when i was there. So you can try and ask which timing can have this mist out"
,,Outstanding piece of engineering,5.0,,"If you get a chance to visit the cloud forest then do, not expensive but impressive, plus a reprive from the heat. Easy to stroll around inside as it is much cooler inside the dome, you may need an extra layer."
,,Awesome and Unique Experience,5.0,,This is a really cool way to spend a spend an evening in Singapore. It is a nice escape from the heat and humidity of the Singapore day. A great man-made garden and waterfall and an overall unique experience.
,,Eye opener!,5.0,,"Beautiful, imaginative and well thought out and designed! Bring an extra jacket as you may be surprised about the temperature drop!"
,,Don't miss it !,5.0,,"This is the most amazing space. It's the second dome at gardens by the bay. Very different to flower dome. The view once you reach the top is breathtaking.its hard to believe it's all man made and so well maintained.
Beware of the awesome waterfalls as you can get quite wet from their spray.
Great place to visit if you get caught in a Singapore rainy day
Leave plenty of time to explore the domes and then see the evening light show at the trees
If you go early afternoon you can enjoy the domes at your leisure and the be in time for the light show"
,,Nice getaway,5.0,,"It is essentially a botanical garden in a ""vertical"" concept. Truly beautiful and refreshing, well done!"
,,Man made waterfall,5.0,,It's really nice place to see a man made forest. Worth to visit. They showed how forest is important to our life. Try to see the detailed view of garden by the bay and dome structure
,,Awesome place!,5.0,,It is definately a place to go! So don't think if it is too expensive. Probably you wil be there only once and it is really sth unique.
,,Excellent Art of Forest,5.0,,Excellent Art of Forest; this place set of cool details to explorer the forest and various of plants.
,,Rain forest greenhouse,4.0,,"A unique set up -- a rain forest climate in this greenhouse complete with very tall waterfall and a canopy walk high up above the floor.

While the canopy walk would be scary for anyone afraid of heights like me, my daughter says it is good fun.

There are a couple of viewing areas which you can climb up to and stand in behind the waterfall which are not scary.

Besides all the unusual plants that you can see in this greenhouse, it is also a great place to cool down from the hot sun outside and recover."
,,"Man made waterfall, but beautiful experience",5.0,,"A wonderful place to escape the heat of the day, but so much more than that! Something special to witness at each turn, beautifully arranged and an easy walk from top to bottom."
,,Just Wow,5.0,,The waterfall at the entrance is just wow. The whole theme of the garden is just mesmerizing. A must visit place
,,Wow,5.0,,Amazing place - found the whole experience incredible and the film at the end - +5 degrees - was thought provoking.... more countries should look at climate change like this
,,World of Wonders,5.0,,"There is a garden here called the Lost World and when you wander around you can see why. This place is full of marvels, the waterfall on entry is amazing, the sculptures of prehistoric creatures are magnificent, the gardens are gorgeous .... the story behind all of this makes you stop, think and be grateful - but also be afraid if we don't something about our effects on the climate!

It's a relatively easy walk from the Harbour Front MRT or Marina Bay. If you need or prefer there are shuttle buses for a small price. The walking in the Cloud Forest is easy, and there lifts etc for prams and those who require them. The heights might not be fun some, but they've done their best to make it available for all. Price not too bad - we got both observatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) for $28 Singapore $$'s.

An especially great activity on a beastly hot day or rainy day!"
,,A must do in Singapore so budget for it,5.0,,"If you don't like heights you won't like this, but the rest of us should go see this amazing indoor cloud forest, with winter falls and gorgeous plant life. You would be sorry if you missed it!"
,,Impressive indoor forest,5.0,,"Upon entry, you are greeted by an over 100-feet high waterfall pouring from the top of a man-made mountain. It is quite awe-inspiring. Then you take an elevator to the top of the mountain and walk down along a walkway that sticks out in mid-air and circles the mountain. The view from the walkway is equally impressive. I was expecting just another indoor botanical garden but this one really took my breath away. I would consider this a must-see attraction in Singapore and a photographer's paradise."
,,Stunning!!,5.0,,"This place is just magical. My husband and I done both the flower and cloud domes and spent a good 4 hours here wandering around. The waterfall entrance is stunning and the walk from the top to the bottom
Is so pretty. We loved looking at all the flowers and taking loads of pictures. Would definitely recommend if visiting Singapore. Easy to access via the MRT too."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"This place is so beautiful. A must go and get ready your camera with enough space! We bought the tickets online, and it's convenient to redeem it at the counter. You can also buy the tickets at the counter as well."
,,Mind blowing place!!,5.0,,"Such an awesome & beautiful place full of plants, waterfalls, skywalk & it's all about beautiful nature all the around. Feels very refreshing & up lifts your spirit."
,,Natures beauty,4.0,,A must for an entertaining time away from humidity . . So we'll set out with walkwYs and ramps for access for all. Lift access available for wheelchair allows for all to enjoy the true beauty of this forest. A waterfall that enlightens you once you enter along with mist of vapor keeps the environment cool.. Great for all family members
,,Nice and cool.,4.0,,This is a good place to cool off for a while and see some ausome plants and ferns. There is a large sky walk that takes you up amongst the plants and a huge indoor water fall.
,,Never get tired of visiting!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is amazing. I've visited three times since it opened and love to see the changes and plant growth as this venue ""grows"". Everyone I've taken there is amazed at the beauty and engineering brilliance of the Cloud Forest."
,,Educational,5.0,,The Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay is a must visit for both young and old. And I suggest you bring a sweater or anything to warm you because it is quite cold in there. Explore and see all the beautiful plants and flowers and learn at the same time.
,,My Cloud Atlas,5.0,,"We were greeted by an impressive waterfall when we entered into the Cloud Forest. Don't let this impressive sight take away your attention to the exotic plants and flowers that framed the entrance and the surrounding area. When the mist started to seep through the forest, it reminded us on our visit to South America last year. Highly recommended."
,,Amazing man made Forest,5.0,,"Impressive indoor forest. With the walking way around from top to bottom, it offer amazing views. A must visit when reach garden by the day. For entry, online combo ticket offer better deal."
,,Walking in the heavens!!,5.0,,"Have never seen anything so breathtakingly beautiful in all my life. The richness of color and nature in a giant dome shaped like a cloud. A magnificent waterfall awaits when you walk in the doors. Flowers and orchids, and more species of orchards everywhere. Makes a Disney adventure pale in comparison."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"This is an amazing atracction, and a must visit if you visit singapore. Especially when they turn on the sprinklers, it is really like gardens in the mist."
,,Very beautiful and thrilling,5.0,,"Cloud forest is inside the garden by the bay. It is a very high man-made waterfall which is coming out of a three story cave. It is beautiful and gives you the feel of actual forest. On each story they have different setup like Crystal statues etc. They have built a iron net walkway on the third storey around the cave which lets you walk around the cloud forest enjoying view from the top. It gives you a lot of thrill and scare.
Word of caution you can get a little wet and few surfaces are slippery as well.
My recommendation is that it is a must visit place."
,,Unique,5.0,,"Cannot understand those who reviewed this place and said it was boring. We have never seen anything like it, so well laid out, yet again and interesting. Another must see."
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,"Just an amazing experience , It trully needs to be experienced as its beyond words to eb described . I will revisit as soon as i step back to Singapore"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We liked it very much. We visited it in the evening and it was great time - not so many people, quite and amazing atmosphere."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Incredible place - and what a refreshing change of climate after suffering the heat outside :) - definitely worth it.
,,Best thing to visit in the gardens,5.0,,"Tip - search online for tickets/vouchers - I did and got 20% off. Don't bother with the shuttle unless you need to as is a very nice walk through the Gardens.

If you have time for only one of the Cloud forest/Flower dome, chose cloud forest as it is far superior.

Pretty much a gentle walk up with some briliant views and photo opportunities as long as no rude visitors push in your way."
,,Great day out,4.0,,A out of this world place to visit and i enjoyed the lay out of whole place with the plants and water mist . enjoy
,,futuristic waterfall,5.0,,The waterfall is main star of Cloud forest dome. Especially in the evening when it is oncolored with different lights. Walking at least one way to the top is a must! There are babolous views and I felt like visitng another planet....
,,Spectacular,4.0,,It has a huge waterfall with skywalk. Also they have a wonderful collection of flowers and a mirror view pool.
,,Superb.,5.0,,"Loved the Cloud Forest, go early when crowds are less. So much to see, we spent about 1-2 hours here but still missed some things. Would definitely visit again."
,,Delightful flora,4.0,,Interesting collection of various species of plants from around the world. Loved that fact that we could get away from the humidity for bit as we strolled through the area.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Its the largest greenhouse i have ever seen. Perfect conditions provided inside for plants to grow perfectly
,,Peacefull Place,5.0,,"I suggest you come early at 9.00 a.m so it's quite and not full. Most of the tourist walk thru the building without reading the signs and are listening to the presentation about clima change. You should do it. I spend 2h in the Cloud Forest the price is worth any penny, bring a jacket with you."
,,Very cleverly done,4.0,,"I thought it would be hot and humid in here being all closed in but was very pleasantly surprised to enter a cool, almost chilly dome with beatifully laid out gardens with incredible plants. So much thought has gone into it and whoever did it should be congratulated"
,,Singapore at its best,4.0,,"Of the 2 domes, this is the better one. It really gives you an experience of what it is like to be in a rain forest. The waterfall is very exciting. They really did a great job on making it look real."
,,Love it,5.0,,All I have to say about this place is like the best of u don't do cloud forest you have missed out on a lot of things best experience was the sky walk u start from top and on every level u have an activity to do and complete something very different must definitely go n spend good amount of time there u will love it too
,,Fantasy experience,5.0,,"The cloud dome was just like being in a rain forrest, walkways up into the sky and by the waterfall was just unreal and fabulous. It was like a film set"
,,Ingenious,5.0,,So well laid out with vertical plantings as well as gardens and trees Very worthwhile a gentle upward walk taking you through the different species. Do not miss this attraction.
,,Waterfall Wonder,4.0,,"It is definitely worthwhile working your way up to the top of the waterfall to observe the lush greenery and flowers on the descent back to ground level. Everything is very well done and includes walkways out over the gardens, spray from the waterfall and life-like sculptures throughout. Lovely and cool on a hot day !"
,,Unique experience wonderful range of foliage,5.0,,Go early to miss busy periods Wonderful walkway through over and around tropical plants spectacular building
,,Waterfall!,5.0,,"Fabulous waterfall, go to each level with walk ways and also lifts, feel the spray on your skin! Worth a visit."
,,A must see when you visit Singapore,5.0,,"Really well done like most things here. Been a ocuple of times and it always surprises me what oyu have missed on the previous visits,"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful recreation of many environments. A bit crowded and difficult to get inside unless you wait for lift.
,,wonderful and amazing,5.0,,"the indoor waterfall and plant selection are both beautiful and awe inspiring. the lego pitcher plants were a cute touch in the pitcher plant garden,"
,,Totally unique,5.0,,Absolutely breathtaking showcase of nature and environmental issues. Recommend going after dark as feels magical with the lighting effects.
,,Beautiful and poignant,5.0,,The Cloud Forest features beautiful and strange flora at up to 2000 feet above sea level interspersed with intricate wood carvings. Great for visiting on a warm day as the temp inside is 23-25 degrees C. Those who get chilly quickly should bring a light jacket or shawl. Be prepared to amp up the steps on your Fitbit!
,,A memorable visit,5.0,,Do not miss this venue. We had no trouble in spending a couple of very enjoyable hours there after walking from the Elizabeth Hotell near Orchard Road
,,A a beautiful garden experience,5.0,,Far better than I expected - surprises around every corner. Fantastic presentation of tropical plants from around the world
,,What a surprise,5.0,,Really nicely done. Great attraction close the cbd. A most got to place overall. Go early so it's not busy.
,,Simply breathtaking!,5.0,,"This is a wonderful experience. A man made mountain, complete with a waterfall, depicting plants and flowers found at varying heights. A superb concept for those who wish to visit mountains without actually going there. Tip: those not very physically fit may wish to take the lift to the top and work their way down. The walkway taking in the city views is a bonus attraction with this visit."
,,Beautiful forest,5.0,,Amazing. The walk amongst the trees and through the waterfall is beautiful. Great destination for families
,,@ Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,Excellent dome structure which is temperature controlled and has a wide variety of flora from all parts of the world.
,,Interesting,5.0,,A great place to see how the flowers and vegetation adapts at different levels of a mountainous humid climate. Be sure to bring a wrap or sweater as it is chilly when higher up.
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,"Very well laid out and value for money. ($S 22 on line). Requires a bit of time and energy. Have just spent 4 hours and 12500 steps, but it's well worth it."
,,Stunning part of the Gardens on the Bay,4.0,,As one of the two biomes at the Gardens this is the larger with some spectacular sights. Firstly you have the highest waterfall (indoor!) in Asia which you can view from the base and the top and then you have the beautifully laid out plants and finally you have the raised aerial walkway. The orchids were my favourites as they were stunning !
,,BREATHTAKINGly beautiful,5.0,,one must visit this architectural beauty and a morden marvel. It is definitely a must visit and I am coming back here again.
,,In with the Gardens by the bay a MUST DO,5.0,,"This area is absolutely wonderful, Take a small hand towel or similiar or umbrella as you can can wet as you enter but just to see the misting and waterfall is fantastic, I just strolled around in ther for a few hours, it is amazing, I got a Taxi to the GarBens by the bay from the Hotel and spent the day walking around and ended up at Marina sands,"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Even if you aren't into plants and gardens, this place is well worth a look. Especially around midday when they turn the misting on. It's worth going in just to get out of the heat too.

Having such a large living garden in a biodome is impressive. It's very informative, and does an excellent job of explaining the how and why.

No climbing involved as there are elevators and escalators through the entire centre."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit the kids will love it. Easy to get to and walk around. Everything is there for you.
,,Fabulous Place,5.0,,"What a truly fabulous place this in, so much work has gone into creating a wonderful experience of plant life."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,It is like a dream. Very beautiful and peaceful garden with very nice view over the sea. Nice walks around the garden with nice waterfall. It is a must to see.
,,AMAZING BEAUTY,5.0,,just like that you will be amazed by the beauty for this falls must visit in daylight best place with indoor falls
,,Take warm clothes but do visit it!,4.0,,"I think it is a great place to visit, the only but being that nobody tells you how cold it is inside. you need to wear something warm, but the place is amazingly beautiful with all the cascades, the pasarelas, the plants..."
,,cool,4.0,,"In singapore's hot weather, it was a great feeling to enter the cool environment of the cloud forest!! Nice small artificial forest, but overpriced for the half an hour walk…."
,,Beautiful place and attraction you don't want to miss!,5.0,,Just beautiful. You must visit to feel beautiful and a great walk whether it is in the air conditioned part of the park or not.
,,Amazed!,5.0,,"Only god knows how I feel the moment I saw the man made waterfall. I was stunned not only by its beauty but also the possibility how can this beautiful object be made by man. Though I am fearful of height, I pushed myself to head to L6. I did feel jittery looking down from L6, but for sure the fear is worth every moment. And I am glad I make this decision to be up there!"
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a nice, cooler place to visit on a hot afternoon in Singapore. A ticket must be purchased within the Gardens by the Bay, to enter the exhibit. A winding indoor path takes you around an indoor mountain waterfall. There is much to learn along the way. There are many stairs/escalators, but elevators are available too for those with physical limitations. A unique experience. Should be paired with visiting the Flower Dome!"
,,BLOWN AWAY!!,5.0,,This is a place of a dream that became reality. 😐 you just to bring your jacket if you easily get cold. The journey was splendid. The views and learnings are all worth it.
,,Such an amazing experience,5.0,,"Like something I have never seen before. Beautiful plants and environment, very interesting. Great place to take photos."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,My wife and I spent a wonderful half day at this interesting venue. The gardens are beautifully kept with many interesting specimens accompanied by very good descriptions including their latin names. The ancillary services such as food outlets and toilets are also well kept and there are numerous guides available to give directions and explanations.
,,Scarily Beautiful,4.0,,"We visited this dome late in the afternoon, after coming from the flower dome. Upon entrance, you immediately get the forest feel, as you are greeted with a huge waterfall. Also, its very chilly inside.

It's amazing how the various forest plants, trees and flowers were put together in one place. If you are afraid of heights, like me, you would feel a little bit scared and uneasy as you would walk along elevated walkways but the sight is all worth it as there are anyway protective railings you could hold on to.

The best thing about this, there are lifts inside that would take you to the top, then walk along elevated walkways to marvel at the abundant forest greens. You will then go down to the next platform through escalators.

Highly recommended!"
,,"Never seen before, so definitely visit",5.0,,This is really amazing man made mountain with waterfall that you can check out. You ride an elevator up to the top and walk down the paths around the mountain. Never seen something like this and it really is very cool. Definitely check it out!
,,Superb Experince,5.0,,This is probably the best of the 2 main attractions and incorporates an elevated walkway which affords great views of the surrounding Marina Bay area. You can get a little wet from the spray from the waterfall but this is worth it for the photo opportunity.
,,Very pretty and inetersting,5.0,,"I really likes the cloud forest, not only because of how beautiful it is, but also because it offered some additional touch explaining interesting facts about the environment and client change. Highly recommended!"
,,Amazing. A good feel for how these plants should grow.,5.0,,I grow a lot of plants that they have in this cloud forest. I don't grow them nearly as well though. You have to go here to feel how orchids and bromeliads and others plants grow in their natural environment. They have created an amazing climate there.
,,Must see!,5.0,,Really cool place to unwind. Another worthy attraction in Singapore. However if you don't like heights don't go up inside the cloud forest as the walkways are pretty high up.
,,Just an amazing place to visit,5.0,,Didn't know what to expect but had high hopes. It is just amazing how the garden has been grown and to the a hundred metre high garden. The walk through was well set out and made the viewing easy.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Don't miss this wonderful indoor forest/garden! The sky walkways give you an awesome view of the surrounding areas as you walk down from the top of the dome. It is a welcome relief from the heat of Singapore!
,,True marvel of greenery in a world city,5.0,,"This is a must visit to Singapore - the combination of stunning engineering, design and garden layout is superb. The hanging gardens of Singapore! Lovely with family, friends and couples alike - there are one or two really excellent restaurants - as well as the hawker style eateries by Satay by the Bay nearby for a post stroll top up!"
,,DO NOT MISS,5.0,,"i am one of those people who hates gardening of any description, but the visit to the cloud forest was a spectacle that surprised even me. Superbly laid out so as to not miss any display, the time spent here was excellent value for money. Although you need a head for heights on some of the walkways, if you can overcome the your fears , you will be astounded by what you see. CONGRATULATIONS to the people of Singapore for putting on such a show of flora and forna."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,Part of the garden by the bay project. Amazing structures being colonised by a variety of plants. The walkway was closed on our visit. Nevertheless a good impression of these strucures can be obtained from the ground.
,,Terribly disappointing,2.0,,Tawdry and cheap tourist attraction. Loud with screaming kids and clearly designed to separate tourists from their money.
,,WOW!,5.0,,This place is absolutely stunning. Was a great day out with my wife and child. The whole of the gardens were beautiful. Be sure to go right to the top and get the cloud experience. Was very good fun. Highly recommended.
,,What a wonderful waterfall with amazing view ( must see in Singapore),5.0,,"Could forest is an part of Garden By The Bay and it's and man made waterfall with high elevated walk way where one can go to the top and come down slowly through spiral walk way..... enjoying the wide variety of flora and fauna .... and water fall .... together with display section at very stage.

On the entry of Could garden ... water fall refresh you with mist of water and that is an awesome feeling."
,,Unbelievable verticle gardens !,5.0,,"This was a great day out, undercover so any weather but great when the sunshines. Walkways above the canopy were unbelievable getting you right up amongst the canopy."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We visited this as part of our visit to the Gardens by the Bay. It is worth every single penny to get into here, it is simply spectacular and we were overawed throughout. Despite the number of people around, it is peaceful and tranquil and is a welcome break form the heat and humidity as it is cool and refreshing inside. Do not miss this as it is so wonderful and we cannot recommend enough."
,,fantastic. see the cloud mist each hour or two,5.0,,Worth the price of admission. Climb the stairs or take the elevator. it's worth it. Waterfall is fantastic. go see it!
,,A must in Singapore!,5.0,,"Not only is this place filled with gorgeous flowers and rare plants, it also educates the public about global warming and what we can do as a human race to help prevent it from happening at such a drastic rate. A great way to spend a hot afternoon; it can get a bit chilly in there! Highly recommend!!!"
,,what a waterfall,5.0,,"Great waterfall, you take a lift to top then walk down through wonderful flowers and plants with so much to see."
,,Forest in a boundary,5.0,,This is a part of gardens by the bay..spiral stair can take you to the top.nice view from above.....
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"We loved it in here, plus it was so nice and cool! An amazing array of flowers and trees, the walk ways up through it all to the waterfall is wonderful."
,,More spectacular one of the 2,5.0,,If you only have time for one of the 2 Glass Houses at Gardens by the Bay this is the place to go - however the bigger one is also a great experience and I would just recommend to visit both
,,Largest indoor Waterfall,5.0,,Absolutely marvellous view when you enter the cloud forest. The humidity levels and atmosphere inside literally feels like you are in a humid rainforest. Check for the maintenance days before you visit.
,,Save this one for a rainy day,5.0,,Extraordinary. Part of the ticket price including the Floral Dome. Llots of enjoyable details to surprise and delight people of all ages.
,,Best of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Amazone site, just go there and enjoy. Do the flower dome first and this one last. I'm nog going to tell you what's there you will have to go in and see for yourself."
,,Great views,5.0,,If you don't like heights don't go... the walkway is high and has mesh flooring but is safe. The waterfall within the cloud was good and well put together.
,,Really nicely done,5.0,,"If you only have time for one of the cooled conservatories (Flower Dome & Cloud Forest), make sure this is the one to visit. It takes you up by elevator, and via a spiralling ""boardwalk"" style walkway, you walk down again. It gives you very nice view of nature (tropical waterfall included!), but also of the bay area outside. Try to avoid the weekends, as it may get crowded (or try it at night - the views are different from daytime and again, less people)."
,,Waterfalls,4.0,,"The water fall is amazing. An impressive vegetal wall , with a good representation of the Oceania and tropical , subtropical plants. Inside the big structure an expo on the stalactites and stalagmites"
,,"Unique experience, cool and delightful",5.0,,You are amazed as soon as you enter the building. The atmosphere is wet and cool and it is a great relief after walking about in Singapore's famous humidity. This is a place for young and old. Access is good for all. Sit down and take in the sounds and coolness.
,,A featureof Gardens by The Bay,5.0,,"Spectacular, cool, beautiful plants, magnificent structures. Amazing piece of architecture and engineering and the plants are spectacular. I am NOT a huge lover of plants. Got to Visit if in Singapore!"
,,A Must-see Garden,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay is amazing and the Cloud Forest gets better every time we visit. The plants just get bigger and better.
From the water pool at the very top you just stroll down the catwalks and be amazed by the diversity of the plants and flowers. Make sure you visit the video display about climate change at the bottom and then wander through the hidden valley at the exit to the theatre and marvel at the incredible wooden carvings found amongst the plants"
,,Such a cool place,5.0,,Wow is all I could say when we went in here the water falls the sculptures just WOW nothing else to say but WOW
,,I loved it!,5.0,,"I recommand this place at night time, less peoples, and the lights makes somethings magic! I really enjoy!"
,,Very impressive structure.,5.0,,We thought this place would be very hot and humid when you look at the structure. Looking like a giant greenhouse you'd think so. But it has a really pleasant temperature. Work your way down from the top which is 6 floors up. Very impressive structure indeed.
,,Best place so far.,5.0,,"Cloud forest is inside gardens by the bay and one of the most astonishing place to visit in Singapore. The entry ticket cost a bit on the higher side however, worth every dollar. Best place to visit with family. Centrally air conditioned. Amazing sky walk."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,A wonderful display of flowers and artwork. Various levels are accessed by elevator and walkway. Visitors normally take the elevator to the top of the mountain and use the disabled friendly walkway to descend. Great views of Singapore are available from the walkway. Highly recommended
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,Beautiful place with great architecture and plants. Can get very crowded. Wish they had some birds or animals in there.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,As you enter the building there is a High waterfall in front of you.Excellent views on the high walkways. The setup was really good .
,,another world,5.0,,The cloud forest is in one of two domes within the Gardens By The Bay complex. The whole area is well worth a visit. All of the outdoor parts are free to enter although you will have to pay t go into the cloud forest or the other dome which house temperate plants. The charge is worth it (especially for a European who will not have seen cloud forest plants before). Very well laid out though people taking selfies on the walkways were a bit of a nuisance. You can choose to visit only the cloud forest or get a better rate if you pay to visit both domes.
,,Cloud Dome is well worth a visit-easy access,5.0,,The Cloud Dome was very impressive and the elevated walkways were easy access and there are elevators and escalators too
,,Cloude forest to see in Singapore,4.0,,Very beautifull park in the gardens by the bay. A nice waterfall and a lot of plants and flowers. A recommondation to see.
,,Great Design,5.0,,The cloud forest is part of the Gardens by the Bay and is a huge cool zone that towers several stories high with waterfalls cascading down the tropical planting. The view form the top is very good indeed.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Stunning design. Just a beautiful place to relax. Try and avoid during school days while there are school groups coming through.
,,Different Kind of Cloud Forest,4.0,,It is very chilly inside. wearing long sleeves will help. though i don't understand the concept. it's a good couples site or for taking snaps. artificial fog and waterfall do make the place a bit romantic for couples if it's not too crowded.
,,Fabulous.,5.0,,"We had just been to the Flower Dome and to follow on to the Cloud Forest was just brilliant. Such care, design and love has gone into this and it is so enjoyable and wonderful to see. Tip if its a super hot day perfect to come to the Cloud Forest or Flower dome as they are air-conditioned. Loved it."
,,Out of this world,4.0,,Imagine a world filled with plants and flowers. This is it. Absolutely stunning place. I wouldnt go to singapore without visiting cloud forest.
,,Something special,5.0,,"Definitely worth to visit.Something special, big waterfall, lots of plant species from rain forest in one place.artfully decorated place"
,,Woaw!!,5.0,,"A performance! A great stroll, refreshing atmosphere, and all the keys at the end of the visit to save the planet. The kids loved it."
,,"Fabulous and impressive, must see.",5.0,,"This stands out as a highlight of our trip to Singapore. We'd done the Flower Dome first and weren't that impressed (it's like a giant garden centre back home), but we were blown away as soon as we walked into the Cloud Forest to be greeted by a six storey high waterfall - indoors! The ""cliff""of plants is simply stunning and you walk around in on ""skywalks"". It's a fabulous piece of engineering if nothing else. We highly recommend visiting."
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,"Allow plenty of time to view this well put together attraction. From the bottom up, along the walkway under the waterfall through magnificent gardens. Xxx loved it."
,,I got to the top,5.0,,Beautiful place. We go there early bet the crowds. The plants/flowers were stunning. I am afraid of heights but managed to do this with no problems.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"One of two domes and the best - great space, well thought out. We enjoyed the sky walk which shows plants from an angle you do not usually see.

A great waterfall giving the appearance of rainforest the last time I experienced this type view was at a Victoria Falls in the slash cloud

Some great sculpture/ carving set in and amongst the plants"
,,Awesome attraction.,5.0,,"You have to see this. It's a small forest, totally enclosed and held at a comfortable temperature. You will definitely enjoy the visit."
,,Amazon Jungle Waterfalls Indoors.................,5.0,,"On a hot, humid, Singapore day, you would like to see an Amazon waterfall but perhaps you do not want to go outside.

Here is the solution. This rainforest is temperature controlled, indoors and absolutely amazing. In addition to all of the plant and flowers, they have sculptures within the plants which adds to the Amazon mystique.

Well worth an afternoon visit and should be a ""Don't Miss"" event."
,,"Very cool, literally!",5.0,,"best part of the Cloud Forest is the climate control! nice to get out of the oppressive heat in March. That said, a nice tour. nice foliage, interesting exhibits."
,,Cool presentation of nature,4.0,,Interesting presentation of nature. Kids love it. Adults will too since the kids don't bother them as much when they're comfy and cool. Only gripe about the place is the slow lifts for people with strollers.
,,Go early,3.0,,We went at night and it was a bit dark already so we didn't really much of this attraction. I think it's better appreciated if you go earlier in the day. Still an interesting experience tho. Tip: Bring at least a light jacket since it could get cold in here.
,,I COULD SPEND HOURS HERE.,5.0,,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING WHAT THEY'VE DONE HERE. I can not STRESS how cool this inside waterfall is and how beautiful it is!
,,We loved this,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is excellent and a must see in Singapore. We loved the waterfall and walking up the ramp was a lot of fun.
,,Magical,5.0,,"We were lucky to arrive just at misting time - a cool oasis after a walk in the heat through the gardens. The plantings and layout are spectacular. Even with a crowd of people, there was no feeling of being crowded. The sound of the waterfalls was so relaxing and there was no feeling of being rushed.
The educational impact of the displays - especially +5 degrees - was sobering and informative.
Highly recommend!!!!!!!"
,,Cool and Calm,5.0,,"My kids and I had a great time in this cool place. The waterfall makes it cool and the pleasant to be in. Lots of photo opportunities but mostly a great place to go with family or as a couple. Take the lift to the top and gently make your way down on each floor is an exhibition for various themes. Kids might get bored with looking at the waterfall or just relaxing by the flowers so I suggest you let them explore the exhibitions on each floor while you sit down near the waterfall and keep an eye on them.
Suggest a day trip and one by the evening as the lights in the dark will give you new colours and different facade to the place. Useful McDonalds near the entrance which is a good place to top up before you head in."
,,Superb,5.0,,"An amazing experience and great place to visit. It was hot the day we went and we were very happy to be indoors after enjoying all the attractions outside. The waterfall is breathtakingly beautiful as are all the surroundings the whole atmosphere blends in very naturally. So many displays inside too. Personally feel this is a place not to be missed. Totally recommend to all. Very friendly, cheerful and hospitable staff."
,,Amazing,4.0,,Nice flaura and fauna. Its very cooling and quite a sight to behold with the artificial waterfall running through.
,,Purely fantastic,5.0,,"Will recommend to all friends and visitors. Will remember to bring extra clothing next time, colder than the air-conditioned buses here."
,,Amazing,5.0,,It's a part of garden by the bay. So when you visit that this place is a must see and have amazing experience. The mist which flows across give a chilling effect.
,,"Amazing, spectacular, a must see",5.0,,"This is just fantastic, and had to put across in words just how well down this is. The way it has been put together just blew our minds. Such an array of plants so beautifully displayed.
A word of warning - I'm not good on heights and the top walkway was almost too much for me - I believe the beauty of it all got me over it. I actually would go back again."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,Very impressive by its architecture and the plants in abundance. Absolutely worth a visit. Go in the evening so you have a nice view with the lights
,,Splendid!,4.0,,"It's my first time here actually. I just love the rainforest and all the educational signpost there. There's so much to learn especially, in Singapore, we do not have natural rainforest in that size for us to visit and enjoy. Cloud forest is really a good place!"
,,Three night stay in Singapore,5.0,,Worth doing to see this indoor spectacle. Get to the top and enjoy the waterfalls and tropical plants. Make sure you have your camera.
,,The Cloud Forest is very impressive,5.0,,"It is the best option of the two domes, the Flower Dome being the inferior one. The Cloud Forest is a manmade mountain - you walk up and down and experience vegetation related to a ""simulated"" altitude of up to 1800 metres - and there are even waterfalls and small lakes. It is a great place to chill out after a very hot walk outside since the temperature inside the Dome equals that of altitudes of 1500-2000 metres above sea level (tropical)."
,,Dramatic waterfall!,3.0,,"It was beautifully constructed with a high waterfall at the entrance. Very dramatic, very epic. But this is one place that does not warrant repeated visit. I have been to the flower dome many times but not the cloud forest. And it's rather cold (Singapore standard) by the way."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,if you come to the gardens by the bay yiu must visit this attraction. It is unmissable. Just fascinating. Plants are so beautiful
,,Great,4.0,,This is one amazing view or idea. Took lots of pictures with this structure. And my husband was amazed!
,,Great experience,5.0,,Went here with young kids. Very terrified. It's a great place to experience. View from up was breathtaking
,,amazing,5.0,,"excellent feature to visit, amazing plants in a wetland and elevated setting. quite an easy walk, lift access to each level if needed, well worth a visit"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Best with a carrier or stroller if visiting with toddler in tow. The ground can get a tad slippery in some areas. We spent close to 45 mins wandering around in awe of all the beautiful plants. The waterfall that greeted us was spectacular. The different specimens of flowering plans were a sight to behold. Definitely worth the admission fee!
,,indoor forest,5.0,,"this gems of the world, with 1000 + trees and plants from all over the world were put together and visiting this place is like traveling the world to see all plants and nature."
,,For who love green.,5.0,,"If you like flower, glass and nature, you will love it. Also some of Japanese anime move had such like castle so might be good for them as well"
,,Nice place,5.0,,Very nice place everyone should go there and visit it You need half day there especially in the evening
,,All weather activities for the family,5.0,,"Amazing views as one walk through the site, providing a lot of photo moments for friends and families."
,,Cloud forest,1.0,,Ticket is expensive and there is nothing much to see. The name is misleading as there is no cloud to see here. A separate ticket is required to enter this forest. A waste of money.
,,Gardens by the bay- Cloud Forest,4.0,,It was my first time visiting Gardens ng the bay!! They had a man made waterfall which was like 30 feet high. I recommend to visit this place.
,,amazing,5.0,,the gardens by the sea should not be missed magnificently done the 2 domes all air conditioned and the displays great
,,Marvellous attraction but not for the vertically challenged.,5.0,,I was a bit shakey on this one as I don't like transparent floors but luckily for me there is a central solid portion to the bridges and I got to enjoy the elevated experience with just a little discomfort.
,,..W O W..,5.0,,No words ! We couldn't believe it ! It's such an amazing piece of architecture (I'm not sure what to call such a construction) vision and design ! Brilliant ! A MUST SEE if you love nature !
,,Unreal,5.0,,"This place really is unbelieveable. It's the largest indoor waterfall in the world but there is so much more to see than that - all the different plants and little statues dotted around. It is a wonderful place to spend a few hours (and it's lovely and cool - great for cooling down from the heat outside).

There's also some really informative plaques and a presentation at the end on Global Warming - excellent."
,,Just fantastic !,5.0,,"Loved this place . It is a great place to visit along with the flower gardens it really is a great day out. Very informative and a little humbling when you listen to the information on global warming and our effect on this .
Great place for adults and kids."
,,Take a Moment,4.0,,"Cloud Forest was very very good. Yes, a tourist attraction but one that most should enjoy. I thoroughly recommend seeing this lovely attraction."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,Amazing experience in the forest and enjoyed with many orchids. Temperature is super cold and great view from high. Waterfall is stunning. Worth to visit.
,,Best Learning Indoor Attraction,5.0,,"A good value for money indoor attraction, truly a must-visit in Singapore! It's not just an attraction but it also has a learning component. I can't believe that it's self-sustaining!"
,,The best part of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"I had wanted to see Flower Dome, Supertree Grove and Cloud Forest as they were all top 20 things to do in Singapore, were within the Gardens by the Bay precinct and within walking distance of the Marina Bay Sands where we were staying.

We combined tickets for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and were by far the most impressed by this attraction. We got some great photos from the elevated walkway and even our 9 month old enjoyed looking at the plant life and architecture. We particularly liked the indoor waterfall.

I have to say that more information about the plants would have added to the experience though. All in all one of the best things we did in Singapore."
,,Watch you Don't get wet!,5.0,,An interesting and beautiful way to spend a few hours with various levels and exterior bridge to wander over whilst viewing a spectacular array of plants.
,,Orchids,5.0,,"The best thing about the cloud Forest are the orchids, hundreds of different species, just amazing, well worth a visit"
,,Wonderful experience in this forest,5.0,,"Unsure what to expect but really enjoyed my visit to the cloud forest. So many variety of plants and flowers, with a beautiful waterfall. Great how you can start up the top and slowly weave your way down. Amazing space. Didn't have time to see the flower one, maybe next time"
,,The Kids loved it!,5.0,,"It was a lovely experience, especially during the Christmas season when they have special decor to celebrate the season. I was initially worried that the kids (8 and 4) would get bored but they were fascinated and loved the whole experience... specially the sky bridge. Loved it!!!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"If you're even remotely interested in plants, biology, design or architecture, you have to see the cloud forest and the flower dome."
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"I enjoyed this very much, was quite surprised that the entire place is air conditioned. Some areas don't look so natural and contrived but it overall was spectacular. I would return again."
,,Pay the extra,5.0,,"This is within the gardens by the bay attraction area and you have to pay extra to get in. Pay. Every cent is worth it. Try to time your visit with the clouding times, when micro spray jets fill the dome with ""clouds"". THe design is fantastic, and I would advise taking the lift up to the top and working your way down along all the suspended walkways. What a terrific attraction"
,,One of a kind,4.0,,"When you go to SIngapore, make sure to visit Cloud Forest since this is not found in many countries.

This one is better than the Flower Dome. The best part was the entrance where the tallest indoor waterfall welcomes you. There's a trail you could walk on if you want to get nearer the highest part of the waterfall.

Bring shawl or other clothing to keep you warm as it can get cold inside since the greenhouse's temperature is controlled. You may get a little wet (just a drizzle) when you get really near to the waterfall.

Cons: the view is marvelous but there's nothing much to do. It's like an environmental museum plus greenhouse in one. However, our family enjoyed this better than Universal Studios Singapore. :)"
,,Huge waterfalls,5.0,,This had great paths through what was a veritable rain forest with waterfalls of 4 and 5 stories in height. A great way to self-tour for two or three hours. We went at our own pace.
,,This was the highlight to the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Not only are the plants and waterfalls wonderful but the views through the dome's exterior glass structure towards Singapore are stunning.
,,Loved this place,5.0,,"This place made me happy and sad at the same time... so many plants are extinct because of our negligence and that's impacting the entire eco system .... the forest mist had such a soothing impact ... just sit, breath, relax and enjoy the serenity of the place ... I wish there were actual forests like these in the world"
,,average experience,3.0,,good for those tourist who only visit this place once as the management never change anything inside since my first visit there.
,,Cool and beautful,4.0,,This place is an additional cost to the gardens by the bay. It's amazing when you get inside to see all the different types of plants and the indoor waterfall is spectacular. Definitely worth a look around for a few hours. A chance to take some great photos too!
,,a must,5.0,,for this visit take your time. It is so unusual and rare as an attraction. A wealth of interest in plants and the planet!
,,Frosty Bite..,5.0,,"The first thing that come to your mind when you enter is...""Wow"" esp. when its on a hot summer day with some walk.
The artificial waterfall create mist in the atmosphere all around to give a pleasant feel as soon as you enter.. Clear walk over forest and beautiful flowers all around feels awesome and its a good way to spend time in the so called nature.
A must visit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,So many beautiful displays and so much to look at. The waterfall is a massive stand out. Great for lots of photos and the air conditioning makes it a fantastic place to visit on a hot day
,,Cool Oasis!,4.0,,Wonderful display of the plants and flowers from this ecosystem and also some wonderful works of art within the display. Really lovely cool break from the outside heat.
,,INDOOR TROPICAL AND RAIN FOREST,5.0,,The cloud forest is one of the major attractions at the Gardens by the Bay. It is a large indoor exhibit with the highest indoor water falls. Take the elevator to the top and then walk down thru the rain tropical forest. Many types of plants and educational exhibits are available. Recommend. Hope this helps.
,,Brilliant-absolutely brilliant,5.0,,Human creation and imagination at its' BEST .. what can you say--the atmosphere is so REAL ... and the arrangements are awesome to go till the top of the Dome ... brilliant photographic opportunities
,,Love!,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place, absolutely amazing looking up at the waterfall and everything growing vertically! Worth a visit"
,,Nice garden at the city,5.0,,"what a beautiful garden, the waterfall are the best part of this garden. Good job for Singapore goverment because it can make a forest in the city center."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Do not miss this attractions his is the most beautiful enclosure, the most wonderful flowers, a photographers Paradice. Take a jacket as it is cool inside"
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"This is our second visit, always something different, we always take plenty of photos, there are several shops with very interesting items, if in Singapore you must visit."
,,Cloud 9,5.0,,"An amazing display of flowers in a biodome. Mist sprayed throughout the dome at certain times throughout the day add to an ethereal effect. You take the elevator right up and follow a circular one way path down spiraling amongst the huge central display and allowing amazing photo opportunities. Some tips : if you have flown Singapore airlines show your ticket stub for a discount. The climate is controlled so perfect activity no matter the weather conditions. If you do a combo with the flower dome, do the cloud last as it is more spectacular."
,,the best place,4.0,,"it is my favourite place when I visited in Singapore, fell as in natural forest, clean , neat , cool, fresh and green and do not forget with the water like a waterfall , it is made this place perfect and i am really recommend it for you."

,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"We entered just as the 'clouds' were appearing which made it very atmospheric. Do climb to the top, lovely views and fantastic plants."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"We did this at night and it is truly awesome. It's a relief to get out of the heat and into a cool environment and see all the beautiful plants, flowers and waterfall and then to walk on the high circuit. It's like your're actually at the top of a mountain. I'd say this was a must see."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Just a beautiful concept to enable some stunning plant life to thrive and display their beauty! Gorgeous rhododendrons, anthuriums, ferns,more stunning orchids! A bit wet, misty so must have good foot wear!"
,,Not to miss,5.0,,This is by the side of flower dome. Great view. You get lot of knowledge from the display and the explanation. The skywalk is mazing
,,Tribute to ingenuity,4.0,,"Colossal tower of plants with a waterfall cascading from the top. Take the lift to the top and walk down the pathways which snake around the outside, giving you the best vantage points. It's sister dome (Flower Dome) is also a good way to spend a couple of hours."
,,Tranquility in Singapore,5.0,,"We loved our visit to the Cloud Forest - not just because it was fully air-conditioned making it lovely to get in out of the heat and humidity but because it is a tranquil, relaxing place to visit. You can feel the rush of the waterfall (and even get right under it if you really want to) and walk along the suspended walkway admiring the view of Singapore and the gardens at the same time."
,,What can i say,5.0,,Another typically Singaporean display. Absolutely amazing. I truly found it fascinating. Where do i look first. Brillant
,,Previously summarised with the flower dome.,5.0,,"A must see, make sure you have on good walking shoes. The waterfall is the centre piece here and the vast variety of plants completely cover the exterior."
,,Something Else,5.0,,"Walk through the doors what a beautiful site greets you... we were amazed . Although a lot of people were in the Dome there was plenty of space and picture opportunities, The Cloud Walk gives a spectacular aspect but not if you have a fear of heights or vertigo ."
,,Fabulous like being in a film set,5.0,,Exciting presentation very well worth paying to go in and see though not recommended for those that don't like heights
,,Fabulous,5.0,,This is a totally wonderful place. Calm and peaceful. There is a huge indoor waterfall with stunning orchids and a huge variety of plants cascading down. The Global Warning video at the end is very good. Everyone seemed to stop and take the time to view it. You need a head for heights. You take a lift up to the top and then wind your way down. Wear trainers or good walking shoes. We booked a ticket online for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome together and had the most enjoyable few hours. This is a real highlight of Singapore. Another reviewer describes the Cloud Forest as mesmerising. I totally agree! This is a Must See.
,,Excellent tourist attaraction,5.0,,"You cannot go to Singapore without visiting cloud forrest....it is simply stunning, words cannot describe...just GO THERE if you are visiting Singapore."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Arrive early morning and walk the outside gsrdens, before it gets to hot. Then visit the Cloud Firest, takebthevliftbtomthe top and make your way down. Then go to the interior gardens and see the 1,000 year old Baobab trees. We gad a lovely dim sum lunch at the gardens before travelin on. This was a real surprise. The gardens are a knockout!"
,,It's a Wow Moment...,5.0,,"You are greeted by a couple of water falls as you enter this attraction with a lot or orchid collections, crystal formation collections, a cloud forest bridge walk as well as a tree-top bridge walk."

,,This is truly memorising,5.0,,"Next to gardens by the sea,its a wonderful gardens,sculpted plants mini bonzi trees,plants made out of animals,mini bonzi trees, ice sculpture plants trees and again lots of plants awash with glorious colours names I couldn't pronounce I dare you to!"
,,Very nice,4.0,,Great value for money and nice few hours out Take some water with you as very hot sometimes. Go in the morning to avoid the crowds
,,Worth the admission,5.0,,"Especially on a hot day (which is most every day on this tropical island), it's cool insides, particularly around the waterfall. Well worth it to go in, and see the beautiful exhibit."
,,Try it,4.0,,One of the Gardens by the Bay attractions. Huge glass building with its own microclimate. Contains plenty of various plants and flowers. Good escape from the day's heat :)
,,Beautiful natural wonder with amazing engineering!,5.0,,"During our 10 day business trip from Houston to Singapore, we had one weekend to visit some of the Singapore landmarks. This one is definitely worth the visit. The Cloud Forest dome is part of the Gardens on the Bay attraction. We bought one combined ticket which allowed us to see both domes - which are indoors which helps with the tricky Singapore weather. Of the two, we preferred the Cloud Forest dome which includes an indoor waterfall, but the Flower Dome was also quite beautiful as well. My favorite was the unique ""sculptures"". Be sure to see both domes."
,,Impressive!,4.0,,"Nice to see, beautiful replica of waterfalls and the natural surroundings, you make a stroll and also enjoy a marvelous view on top of the waterfalls"
,,unbelievable place,5.0,,a lot of varieties of carnivorous plants. we were just blown away with the diversity of venus fly traps and pitcher plants that they had. it's a must see amazing place.
,,In the clouds,5.0,,"Loved walking around this giant greenhouse, admiring the vast array of different plants, and the architecture of the dome.
If you have an interest in botany- this is certainly a must see on your Singapore visit.
I would go early and try and go during the week. It gets busy."
,,A setting of epic proportions,5.0,,"The combination of location, setup, water & nature, all being in the artificial bubble make for a strangely interesting combination. Have to say real value for money."
,,A heaven on earth,5.0,,"This is one attraction that can't be missed. Such a beautiful place to visit together with children. My son (16 years old) and my daughter (6 years old) were totally immersed by the surrounding and the abundance of knowledge that can be leant. The manmade waterfall offers a picturesque setting for a beautiful family photo.
Another plus point about this attraction is that there are many other places of interest within walking distance. So expect to spend the whole day here."
,,A real surprise,4.0,,It's really well set up and we didn't ages looking around here and the dome next door. It was well worth a visit.
,,Amazing,5.0,,An absolutely fantastic place to visit. We had a botanical day visiting the Botanic Gardens first and then down to Gardens by the Bay.
,,Definitely Worth a Trip,5.0,,"Went to a few other things in Gardens by the Bay, but this was by far the most spectacular and totally worth the price of admission. The audacity of the construction and the effort to make it impressive is quite clear. Very Disney-esque, but one of the touristy places that really works."
,,Very cool but not recommended if you are afraid of heights!,5.0,,It is another impressive engineering job done in Singapore not to mention it is beautifull. Only drawback is it can get a little crowded at some times and it is a little expensive but other than that it is worth the time.
,,Must visit this,4.0,,You do not have to be a garden/plant expert to appreciate the design and work which has gone into creating this wonderful garden. It was all fascinating and I would recommend it as a way of getting out of the busy city life.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Excellent value for money and I definitely recommend. Very informative as well and you can do here without the worry of the weather as it's indoors. Easy to get to if you use the hop on hop off bus service
,,Unexpected,5.0,,"After visiting the Flower Dome I gasped as I entered and saw the huge waterfall. Very well idealized, well built, a technological simulation of Rain Forrest. Do not miss it."
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,"Although my husband was hesitant about coming along with me, he will now admit that he too loved Cloud forest. We did not expect the waterfall feature from the moment we entered. The temperature in the dome was cool which allowed us to relax & be comfortable as we explored all this forest had to offer from plants to art sculptures. It is a truly enjoyable experience for all ages."
,,Great place to visit!,5.0,,"The whole of Gardens by the Bay is an awesome experience , cloud forest being an added extra that is also a must see, beautiful plants in a fantastic environment , set of with the waterfall as you walk in."
,,A great experience.,5.0,,"A terrific experience. You have to see this place to believe it. Well worth the admission. Try to get there at night, the lighting inside and throughout the gardens is quite something."
,,must see,5.0,,"Singapore is always hot, but in here and the flower dome it is air conditioned which makes it very comfortable. Amazing design and layout with thousands of varieties of plants. WELL DONE Singapore"
,,Innovative dome,5.0,,"As our taxi driver joked, ""it's like the Eden Project but better"". A very well designed structure to showcase plants in a spectacular fashion. A lift takes you to the top of the dome and you walk through various levels."
,,Brilliant....,5.0,,Was Gob smacked! If you don;t treat yourself and your family to this little adventure you will regret it! Put this place on your to do list.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,This place is really stunning.we went early so didn't need to wait in a queue and were able to make our way around it straight away. There were numerous stunning tree sculptures before even went up to the top. The structure is enormous and literally covered in plants with waterfalls part of the way down.you can even walk virtually under the waterfalls. Very easy for disabled or wheelchair visitors to get around as it is a very gentle slope all the way down. So many photo opportunities. There is a misting system working periodically and it us warm but not too hot inside. Fabulous
,,One of kind,5.0,,"Wasn't sure what to expect, stunning, absolutely stunning, do this and the Flower Done if your in town. Pieces of heaven fell to earth. Will take about 3 hours to do both, well worth the S$ 28."
,,Love this place,5.0,,this is an amazing place. in here you can fell the natural in your soul. really love this place and will visit again
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We went to the Cloud Forest on our daughters birthday between dusk & nightfall. They even sang Happy Birthday as she walked in. Tickets cost $16 each, just for the Cloud Forest but you could buy a ticket for both the Cloud & Flower Dome. Wow what a great attraction, you get to see some amazing tropical plants & flowers. There is a large magnificent waterfall as soon as you walk in, you can get a lift to the top to get a bird’s eye view of the forest. You can then walk down, exploring the waterfall & plants/flowers at different levels. If your not good with heights beware! The dome is cool so you may need an extra layer. Once nightfall had arrived the waterfall changed colour, it was quite spectacular. This attraction was way better than I thought it would be."
,,Lovely respite from the heat- not necessarily a must do,4.0,,"Cool air hits you like a wall and this is very welcome as a contrast to the Singapore humidity!

A lovely walk and opportunity for pictures. If you aren't a huge plant fanatic or if you've been to an actual cloud forest before it's not especially breakthrough but it's certainly a lovely way to spend an hour or so.

Cloud forest walkway felt unexpectedly high and a little scary with open mesh floor (for someone afraid of heights!)

Tickets were $16 x adult, which was fine for the value and you feel like you're contributing to a green future for Singapore!"
,,Felt like tropical island,5.0,,The Cloud forest is very well created and maintained and it feels like you are on a tropical island and are seeing all tropical flowers and plants. This is a must see attraction at Gardens by the Bay.
,,10 times better than Eden,5.0,,"Although disappointed that the Flower Dome was closed for maintenance, we really enjoyed the Cloud Dome. It is a must to climb up to the very top, the displays are beautifully arranged, we especially liked the Lego insect eating plants - very cleverly done; we thought it was a real display until we got closer. Well worth a visit"
,,Amazing,4.0,,You are instantly hit by the coolness as you walk in and the find spray of water from the waterfall which is refreshing after the extreme heat. Lots to see and very well laid out.
,,Such a Unique Attraction,4.0,,"A great escape from the heat as it is kept cool. But it is so unique, a man-made waterfall, with beautiful flora and fauna. Totally worth checking it out."
,,One of it's kind...,5.0,,"Visiting Cloud Forest takes you to a different time zone... It feels as if we are in movie jungle... The place cannot be described, it has to be personally experienced."
,,Very different in a good way!,5.0,,"I thought the Cloud Forest was so unusual, I don't think I've ever seen anything like it, so it was great to explore, and not just because it's about 15 degrees cooler in there than outside!
The structure itself is pretty incredible, you can get a good look at it when you take the walk all the way down form the top. There is tons of information on the incredible gardens and flowers and the waterfall is very impressive. It's just really interesting to walk through.
They also have a small Lego garden near the top which is really cool."
,,"Awesome part of the Gardens, can't wait to go back",5.0,,"My daughter loved the place(14 months old). Very cool inside, the waterfall was a welcome respite from the heat of Singapore. Worth the money"
,,Impressive cloud forest,5.0,,"Beautiful place to visit, impressive plants collection.A lot of exotics flowers. Take a couple of hours for sure is a big place.Close to the subway.Perfect for rainy day.Don't forget your cámara.Recommended"

,,amazing gardens,5.0,,"the weather inside is how all the species can survive, this place is amazing please visit while in Singapore"
,,Great visit with young children.,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is part of the Gardens By the Bay. After walking around all the outdoor gardens, it's nice to get cooled off in Cloud Forest. Can get pretty crowded."
,,For a quiet evening walk,5.0,,"We was here with company of 19 people. And it was a comfortable. A lot of space, beautiful plants, very interesting modern installations. After we went to the show with trees like in ""Avatar"" by Cameron. It was really impressive :)"
,,Unique 'hilly waterfall' oasis in Sunny Singapore,5.0,,"This is a very unique large glass greenhouse conservatory with beautiful verdant green vegetation which covers a 35-metre-tall hill, and interspersed with sporadic bursts of colourful floral exhibits.

A wonderful refreshing gust of cool air and mist hits you, when you enter to view the world's tallest indoor waterfall.

Highly recommended to visit both conservatories, when you are at Gardens by the Bay.

I have not seen this in other countries.

This conservatory is a cooling respite, for escaping Singapore""s heat and humidity since it is kept at a comfortable indoor temperature of around 23 to 25 degrees celcius.

You take an elevator to the top level which is Lost World.

From there, one can enjoy the tree top wall, whereby you stroll down the exterior winding metallic pathway.

They are open daily from 9am to 9pm.
Last admission is at 8:30pm, with ticket sale at 8pm."
,,Artificially natural!!,5.0,,During the mist time this place will give you the feeling of actually being under the clouds.Loved the falls and greenery within it.
,,"Not a must, oK on a hot day",3.0,,Nothing special abou the place except you come from a desert with scant water. The flowers with the rare exception of some ochids are ubiquitous. There are some good informations for kids.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,We loved this cool special place.....14$ Each well spent Wander up and round and back down feeling stunned by the incredible structure and plant growth Refreshingly beautiful
,,Love it!!!,5.0,,This was breath taking. Lots of green and beautiful flowers all around. Very attractive and nice place for photos
,,Unusual experience,5.0,,"Cloud forests are inaccessible so to produce one in mid town Singapore is extraordinary. It is very well worth visiting and I have recommended it as a priority to my friends, especially if they have children. Very child friendly."
,,Reminds me of Avatar,5.0,,"It has this out of this world feel, walking into the dome and seeing this mock mountain with trees and falls. It's a must see when you're in Singapore."
,,like nothing else,5.0,,"The whole place is colourful and wonderful to look at. It's like taking a stroll through a rainforest but it's nice and cool inside, which provides a nice break from the humidity of Singapore, and you can see the city through the glass dome. This attraction really highlights how Singapore has managed to create an eco-friendly urban city. It's unique, creative and a great experience"
,,An oasis,5.0,,"The cloud forest is home to tens of thousands of plants from tropical highlands including the world's tallest indoor waterfall.

Aside from the spectacle offered by the Cloud Forest it is great place to escape the heat and of Singapore as it's temperature is befitting of the climate found 2000 metres above see level. Visitors clearly enjoy this and the refreshing spray from the waterfall."
,,Ambiance!!,5.0,,"This place had an amazing ambiance. I could seriously work here if they let me. The misty cool temperature is absolutely perfect. So perfect it gave me goosebumps. Beautiful greenness, pristine waterfalls. If I lived in Singapore I would probably visit 2x a month."
,,Very cool,5.0,,"I went to both the cloud forest and flower dome and definitely preferred the cloud forest. It was pretty cool. You can ascend to many levels. It's actually - literally - kind of cool in the dome. I remember thinking that I wish I had a little pull over for the time.

The place is all greenery and waterfalls; very nifty. Would recommend."
,,Well done,5.0,,"This attraction is starting to show some signs of wear and tear, but really is something to see. You start at ground floor and make your way up. There are views every where you look."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Definitely a must-see - try to be there when they ""mist"" every two hours to get the full ""cloud"" experience (10am, 12 etc....)"
,,Exquisite!,5.0,,"We spent hours inside this beautiful garden dome, enjoying cool air, appreciating the amiable, fabulous, glamorous plants and flowers and the water fall. We even came back at night, to see how it looked like under exotic lighting. It’s a treasured moment."
,,A Cool walk in the Park,5.0,,"Cloud Forest - my family's favourite place. No matter what is the weather outside, it is always cooling inside. You may even get to see multiple rainbows when the sun shine in the direction of the waterfall. As you walk the sky walk, you would simply be awe by the flowers and plants growing at the side and a great view to see the garden below. It is enjoyable, cooling, and yet, educational because there is an exhibit area to explain the eco-friendly development of the park and the importance of being eco-friendly to the earth. Great place for the family!"
,,Mind boggling,5.0,,What a splendid way to explain what glibal warming will have on the magnificence of our planet. What a feat that shows how man's brain can outdo the past artistic feats of the past. It is a wonder of colour and nature.
,,A must see!,5.0,,"This was absolutely brilliant, there are two domes, a flower dome and the cloud dome. The cloud forest dome is the better of the two but they were both good. We were really impressed by it and thoroughly enjoyed the visit."
,,just breathtaking,5.0,,This is the most wonderful experience in Singapore. Definitely one you should not miss. We went back a second time as you could not possibly see everything and absorb it in one visit
,,Great place if you're too hot in the gardens,5.0,,"If it's too hot outside in the Gardens by the bay, just have a visit in here. Very impressive and definitely worth the money!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Singapore knows how to do it best. A must see if coming to Singapore. Not just the range of plants but the engineering that has gone into building this done makes the visit worthwhile
,,2pm Cloud Spraying a Highlight,5.0,,I really think this attraction is the standout option if you are investing time and cash to visit Gardens by the Bay. It is a great photo & video opportunity like no other you will come across.
,,A stunning concept,5.0,,"This is one of the best pieces of engineering combined with nature I have ever seen.
From the first step through the doors where you are greeted by an enormous indoor water fall to the walk along the sky way several floors up enjoy the walk through a well though out and well put together display of plants."
,,So cold and loving it!,5.0,,It is soooo coldddd and welcoming :) walked at the skyway and kept on screaming HAHAH. the tingly feeet and feeling.
,,Highlight of trip,5.0,,This dome has a tropical rainforest in it with a 95m waterfall. You go to the top by lift and stroll down walkways. The plants are magnificent and there are many gorgeous statues as well.
,,Spectacular Creation,5.0,,"One of the most spectacular places to visit in Singapore. It's located within Gardens by the Bay, and they have created a giant artificial cloud forest and a waterfall inside this dome.

Entry requires a ticket, but with discounts you can pre-purchase a combined a ticket of Cloud Forest + Flower Dome for 30 SGD, and it's totally worth the spend.

Once you go inside, you have to use the elevators to get to the top level, and then you use a ramp to walk down the forest and enjoy the views at different levels. Will take almost 30-45 minutes to walk through the place."
,,Try this at night,5.0,,Stepping into the enclosure at night offers a surreal experience as you encounter the huge man made waterfall just after the entrance. The rest of the dome is well lit and the suspended bridges & walk ways offer spectacular views and countless photo opportunities.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Cloud forest is nice to visit because you are in Singapore at the Gardens. However, there are many people visiting and you will have to stand in line. Nice to do once. Take pictures."
,,Rain forest paradise,5.0,,Visiting here was one of those places where I could have stayed the whole day. You simply do not get tired of the beauty around you. It is well laid out and the flow is easy without wondering where to go next. Of course the plants and flowers were stunning!
,,Take your camera!,5.0,,Part of the whole Gardens by The Bay attraction. Wonderful. Great to get out of the heat or rain. Very reasonable priced. Quite a bit of walking.
,,"The Cloud Forest, what a spectacle!",5.0,,"This is one of the two cooled conservatories over at Gardens by the Bay, and you'll have to pay about 15-20 SGD for the admission fee, but it is certainly worth it. The moment you step inside and take in the cool air, you'll feel refreshed and relaxed. Then you look up and you see the 35 meter manmade waterfall. Amazing! Walking all the way up is a great adventure, and there are lots of informative displays and walkways. A bit of caution to those who have a fear of heights, as you do walk across bridges with spectacular views inside the observatory."
,,nice indoor forest,5.0,,Cloud forest is a very nice place to visit and experience the forest in a another dimension. you will never regret going there.
,,good place,5.0,,sooooo crowded can't take a best photo at this place :( but i'll visit again to cloud forest garden by the bays
,,Out of this world,5.0,,A truly spectacular site. I have never experienced anything like it. Definitely recommend it is seen during misting times.
,,interesting & enjoyable,4.0,,"This was a great to see, it is been a very well thought out tour. starting at the bottom & winding way up to the top seeing thus amazing waterfall with abundance of plant life."
,,impressive structure!,5.0,,Impressive structure - to say the least. Absolutely worth a visit - to see what man can achieve - when there is a will and bravery..
,,Indoor Rain Forest,4.0,,"It is a good place to visit on a very hot day or a rainy day
You must see this dome garden, very creative concept, Waterfall, green plants, flowers, cliff walk, lot of things to see.
We went during day time, some said night time is more beautiful than day time.
It may be. we don't know. We liked it, lot to see there. Don't miss this garden. It may be difficult to take pictures if there are lot of visitors.Go early. Very impressive."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forrest is sensational. It is one of the largest man-made waterfalls in the world, designed to emulate conditions of tropical highlands that are 2000 metres above sea level. As such, the Cloud Forrest is a truly unique bio-system that creates amazing conditions for vegetation to grow. The waterfall is tantamount to this creating the artificial humidity and perfect growing conditions.

Love it. Wish more people in the world would create such unique attractions for others to see."
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore,5.0,,"Feeling like being in a Tropical forest, the Cloud forest is very impressive from its height, all the plants, waterfalls, flowers and explanations, etc."
,,"AMAZING, AMAZING, MUST SEE",5.0,,By far the best indoor garden I have ever been to. The waterfall is truly a sight to behold. Worth the cost to get in and see. Great on a hot day as it's cool in there with a mist on the hour. Definitely will not be disappointed if you visit.
,,A good experience,4.0,,"Wondered how husband would cope with his fear of heights. He however managed it and was so pleased he did. Lots of plants to see, well set out, with other attractions along the way. Glad we visited and thought it was worth the entrance cost."
,,Cannot see what all the fuss is about,2.0,,"The attraction is indoor and consists of two 'spheres'. We visited at Christmas so there was a big deal about the Christmas show / event.
The actual walk particularly up to the waterfall is nice but it is not great value for money, it is an artificial environment simulated to look like nature, it is convenient to view but is limited at best."
,,Beautiful views from above,5.0,,"I was here with my family last May and I have to admit that it's very nice inside and it's pretty awesome how their managed to have a place like this. I would recommend anyone who visit Singapore to give this a go.

Just remember to leave around 4pm if you are planning to catch a cab back to the city. We had to wait about 1/2h hr for a cab around 4.30pm so leave before everyone decided to leave."
,,Allow enough time,5.0,,"Part of the Bay Gardens and a paid extra but well worth it. Two different 'houses' inc Cloud Forest and its cheaper to get a combined ticket, worth visiting both as well.
Really well done exhibits, slick clean efficient and entertaining but allow enough time, say 45 minutes minimum in each."
,,Family trip,3.0,,It is a good place to visit with family. cool and special experience at a city. However better avoid peak season like Chinese New Year. Waited in line all the way from entrance to finish line...
,,A must see,5.0,,"Veeery nice.... go there and look, very much flowers, colours, Nice surroundings.. very easy to go inside, and a very Nice temperature inside when It is hot outside...."
,,"the best of the best, in singapore. dont miss it!",5.0,,"excellent cloud forest. impressive! all the botanic gardens in SG are wonderful, most of them free. this is even better...."
,,Waterfall!,5.0,,This was one of my favourite places in the garden. Worth the cost of $25 for this attraction and the flower dome. There are layers of things to see in here! Including a skywalk.
,,Fantastic place to walk from top to bottom.,4.0,,"We spent quite a few hours exploring this amazing dome! Beautifully planted, amazing waterfalls, interesting facts & displays."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The view from top and the coolness is excellent. Little activity though but I rwally enjoy the falls and walk above
,,A must Experience,4.0,,"Although it is quite expense to get in, (28 SG $ for both conservatory), it is one experience that you should definitely get. Even in hot summer , it was cool inside. You can smell the forest and the fall from inside the conservatory. Buy the ride to the conservatory for an additional 3 $ if you are not keen for a long walk. A must for all nature lovers."
,,"Not for me, waterfall okay",1.0,,Visited with my mother and to be honest not for me. I do not really get it and found it all very boring
,,Redefining Gardens,5.0,,This is most unique and guaranteed to re-writte your experience with gardens. You do not need to even have any interest in plants and flowers to enjoy this place
,,Another great visit,5.0,,We went here about 4 1/2 years ago and it was quite new. IT have not changed a huge amount since then but it was still worth another visit. The whole setup is excellent and there is so much to see.
,,Favourite attraction for me.,5.0,,"There plenty of good things to see in Singapore, but this was the highlight for me. (Except for the otters we saw on the path just past the domes!) We spent 2 hours wandering back down- it's an elevator to the top, thank heaven! You don't have to be a gardening nut to enjoy the beauty of the flowers- it's so beautifully done. Now I understand the reports saying ""don't miss it""!"
,,Experience real cloud forest..,4.0,,"Visit this place with my husband. Its a bit cold for me. I can inagine the real cloud forest must be colder and wilder than this one. Found many type of plantation, leaves and all look beautiful. Dont forget to bring cardigan as it might be cold for some people. Try to walk over the bridge to experinves the height. Its a bit scarry. Dont try if you afraid of high.
Most favorite place at garden by the bay."
,,The most Mazinf indoor botanical gardens in the world,5.0,,"This was the highlight of my trump to Singapore. A must see !!! Indoor waterfall, plants a plenty and an audio that could keep You there for hours"
,,SiFi garden.,5.0,,"Amazing waterfall feels like you are inside a science fiction novel, a real escape experience. I am a nature lover and often don't feel that these modern urban gardens are a success, but this is amazing. Located inside the gardens by the bay with an admission fee, for the time most people spend it is quite expensive but I felt worth it. We went on a week day it although there where quite a few people around it did not feel crowded."
,,Rich forest,4.0,,Its a rich forest home of many trees from all around the world with the possibilty to go up and have a view from above
,,Really outstanding - don't miss it,5.0,,Great place to visit. The range of plants and sculptures / carvings located within the plants are just amazing. The large waterfall as you ender the dome is also pretty stunning. There is even a garden of Lego pitcher plants! It puts all other public greenhouse conservatories in the shade. The walkways at the top of the dome could be a little bit scary if you suffer from vertigo but its definitely worth making the effort to go to the top.
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,"Located next to the flower Dome, cloud forest is a tropical advenrure. Take a photo next to the waterfall and explore the journey to the tops of the cloud forest."
,,Georgous,5.0,,Just amazing Also a must in Singapore We took photos for everything inside so prepAre your camera :)!! Combines technology with nature
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"This garden is extremely interesting for garden lovers and those interested in the environment and 'saving the planet'. It is well laid out, although it's a bit scary for those who don't like heights, but has a lift for disabled persons so no-one need miss out. Thoroughly enjoyable."
,,Cool inside,3.0,,"An inside waterfall is a novel idea. It was cool and refreshing and provided some interesting views. If you go to the flower dome, you must also stop here. It is a great memory of Singapore"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"I loved everything about the gardens at the bay including both domes. You pay about £25 and get a ticket to both domes, little bit expensive but definitely worth it.

The plants and flowers here are very beautiful and it is very interesting to see if all change the higher you go up the forest. There is a good route all the way to the top and bridges that you can walk on and look down below.

Would be good if there was some more information or facts as the boards they do have are quite repetitive.

I would recommend going here about 3pm, walking around both domes and then seeing the supertree light show around 7pm. If Singapore is particularly hot then the domes are a good way to escape the heat as well."
,,An engineering masterpiece and another must see when in Singapore,5.0,,Just amazed at the scale of this building . The man made waterfall fantastic . We were fortunate to be there on the hour that the mist appeared . Definitely added to the already great atmosphere
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Stunning waterfalls, millions of plants and an amazing setup that will blow your mind, got to see it!"
,,Otherworldly,4.0,,"Excellent attraction which cannot be missed. Went with my family including 2 year old daughter. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Congratulations to Singapore for providing such a wonderful attraction. Beautifully presented and maintained with excellent facilities (including toilets suitable for toddlers) and a great variety of eating/drinking outlets dotted throughout the grounds. The variety and quality of flora as well as sculptures, water features were second to none!! If you are headed to Singapore I'd consider this a must do!!!!"
,,Pretty interesting,4.0,,"This is an enclosure in the vast gardens by the bay. It is basically a temperature controlled environment with a man made waterfall and several levels of vegetation and artificial fog, or so it seemed artificial, it could also be a combination of the waterfall and temperature. The levels are great in that they basically offer an idea of different flora but it would be good to have some sort of description at each level as to what they wish to showcase."
,,Amazing and mysterious place,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome is amazing. The waterfall at the entrance is beautiful and refreshing in a way. The Cloud Walk is beautiful, exciting and cooling, and there are many descriptions of cloud forests in the world. The Forest Walk is nice too. The 5+ degree shows a kind of future we would have, and is very effective to teach us about global warming and protecting the earth."
,,tallest artificial waterfall in the world,4.0,,"Singapore really does not have a natural waterfall, it was created by the Singapore government is an artificial waterfall is very high, even the highest in the world. remarkable, entering this place we felt a chill properly in a real waterfall."
,,Heaven in Gardens by the bay,5.0,,Cloud forest is one of the must visit attraction when you are in singapore. Specially visit in the evening time to watch the beautiful lights across the huge waterfall inside the dome. Its breathtaking views and amazing pictures will be your memory forever .
,,one of the domes in Garden by the Bay,5.0,,"Do not miss to go there - Garden by the Bay a nice for a walkaround, but the highlights are the domes!"
,,Cloud Forrest 2017,5.0,,Absolutely amazing technology has gone into this project the waterfalls and tropical plant life is fabulous
,,Cool!,5.0,,"This is a really cool exhibit. The number and variety of orchids and bromeliads is astounding. Although the humidity is high within the dome, it is air conditioned - making it very comfortable on a hot day."
,,An Amazing re-construction of a forest.,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is situated in the middle of the Gardens By The Bay, right opposite the Flower Dome. You can easily spend over an hour walking round the dome, gradually working your way up to the top of the dome. Magnificent indoor waterfall, and loads of photo opportunities. Knocks the Dome at the Eden Project into a ""cocked hat""."
,,Pretty if you're interested,3.0,,"We went one afternoon when we were free. It's pretty but me and my husband don't have a particular interest in flora and fauna so if had found something else to do we could've have easily missed it off the itinerary. The waterfall is lovely as is the whole layout of the cloud forest, be sure to take a cardigan or shawl as it is a little cold."
,,Very well planted,4.0,,We enjoyed the Cloud Dome but it was very congested on a Saturday afternoon so may be better on a week day.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Such a beautiful site to visit! The walk is amazing up to the top. Definitely recommend heading there if you have some time.
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,The waterfalls were a read must-see. They are really impressive and you can walk inside and around them for amazing views.
,,Could have spent the whole day,5.0,,"Spent five hours in the park and domes. Only left because we are not used to walking this much and are still tired from our flight half way around the world. Otherwise, we could have stayed there the whole day. It is wonderful to see the importance that Singapore has placed on creating a world class district of arts and cultural venues."
,,SUPERRBBBB Artificial waterfall.....,5.0,,Its a breathtaking sight to see one of the many beautiful things of nature & so refreshing to jump into at the top & fly with the water off a cliff & make a big splash at the bottom sort like a natural water slide.
,,Stunning building,4.0,,"This was quite interesting, lots of unusual plants and flowers. The walkways are high so if you don't like heights you won't like this so don't waste your money going in. But if you like taking photos straight down from a great height you will love it!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Stunningly beautiful but not for those afraid of heights.a lift to the top let's you out on the sky walk which is a circular walkway down around the forest it's totally safe but the floor at the edges is see through great fun.
,,better chose the Flower Dome,3.0,,"We visited both dome pavilions at Marina Bay. 'Cloud Forest' would be my second recommendation. It is less well organized, and more commercial. Suitable mostly for families with little children, but less science and ecological content."
,,"Cool Place, Literally!",5.0,,"Set in Gardens By The Bay, Cloud Forest is a re-construction of forest at higher altitudes. As this is in contrast to the tropical climate of Singapore, this place is housed in a greenhouse and maintained at a cool climate!

There is the world's highest indoor waterfall, an exhibition on crystals, skywalk that protrudes out of the manmade mountain... There is plenty for visitors to explore over an afternoon. Stay behind after dark for a different ambience when the places is under specially-designed lighting!

Gardens by the Bay is accessible via Bayfront MRT station."
,,Beautiful on its own,5.0,,Great scenery and layout where many nice spots for picture taking. The only downside is the crowd. Perhaps I went during the evening peak.
,,Amazing indoor Forest.,5.0,,The difference this forest provides from the outside of Singapore is crazy. A refreshing break from the heat of singapore. The forest was amazing with waterfalls. There is plenty see and from the top the walk down goes through many exhibits.The bottom also features a sustainability exhibit.
,,Plan enough time to see it!,5.0,,"This is an original visit that you can easily add to the Gardens by the Bay visit, especially if it starts to rain. Plan enough time to see everything."
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"While the next door gardens weren't much to write about in February, the Forest is exceptional. Lots to see, and well described."
,,An Avatar experience,5.0,,It feels like you are floating in the Avatar movie scene. Definitely must-visit. Unique experience. Although I didn't understand the larger than life sized mirrors in the crystal room??!
,,True rain forest,4.0,,Variety of plant is real customer delight. i really wonder imagination applied while designing layout. Evaporation injectors gives nice feeling of being in CLOUDS.
,,Awesome,5.0,,This place is heaven!! The waterfall is beautiful. I visited at night so it was very beautiful. The place is magical in the evening. Check for mist timings before visiting.
,,Best of all!,5.0,,Cloud forest is a very creative concept. I like it a lot. It brings you more near to nature! Don't even try to miss the spot!
,,Dont miss this!!,5.0,,This was really stunning and one of the highlights of our trip. Try to time your visit with the misters. Well done Singapore - this is amazing.
,,Must see,5.0,,This is our second visit to the Cloud Forest - such a magnificent experience. We preferred this to the Flower Dome.
,,Nice indoor garden,4.0,,It was nice and well organized With artificial fog to give impression of real forest you will enjoy going there
,,"Fascinating structure, intriguing views of nature",4.0,,"To be honest, the experience is far better than this description- it's a concrete and steel structure more or less covered in greenery and flowers. But once inside, the view and the variety of flora are captivating."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Amazing place to enjoy the flowers, plants and the waterfall in an air conditioned environment. Good place to take a lot of pictures"
,,One of the highlights of my brief visit to Sinagpore,5.0,,"Despite only being in Singapore for a few days on business, I was determined to visit this place.
It was quite a walk from my hotel, and in the typical Singapore weather, I was VERY hot by this point. However, the biggest surprise when inside the dome is how cool it was! I was expecting it to be a giant greenhouse, with almost unbearable temperatures inside. This is NOT the case. It's really pleasant inside, so you can really take your time to explore and marvel at the architecture of this astonishing building.
Make sure you go all the way to the top for some amazing views.
It's not free, but it's definitely worth it"
,,not bad but not great,3.0,,this is just a small indoor display. you'll just enjoy the waterfalls and the different kinds of flowers. that's all
,,Very nice and beautiful. Also full of knowledge.,5.0,,Very nice and beautiful place. Also full of knowledge. You will experiences nice atmosphere and various beautiful pants.
,,An amazing creation,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is an amazing creation in Singapore. It is a vertical forest - a new concept nowadays. The amazing part of the cloud forest is that its made up of thousands and thousands of small plants which give the impression of a mountain with shrubs all over. And right at the entrance is an artificial 100 ft waterfall. There is a pathway which leads you right to the top of the Cloud Forest structure. There is a special attraction on one of the levels where you see insectivorous plants. When you look closely, you find they are made of LEGO structures!! Overall an exciting visit and a must see in Singapore"
,,Interesting Place to be,5.0,,It is worth visiting when you come to Singapore. One of the attraction that you wont want to miss. With the technology might be the only indoor man made waterfall around
,,"Similar to Mt. Kinabalu, Malaysia",4.0,,"Its incredible I would say the least. The moment you enter you will see a high up waterfall and sprinkling water. Its chilling inside. They had create an atmosphere similar to rainforest. As I came from Borneo, I would say similar to Mt. Kinabalu at Sabah where the real rainforest are. If you are not picky and just want to have a feel how was it like to be in the rainforest, visit Cloud Forest. Though i find it to man made, not much is feeling real unless you are a born city concrete baby than this place will be superb for you."
,,A memorable walk in the clouds,5.0,,"A stunning and worthwhile experience, showing a massive range of cool-climate plants grown to perfection in this marvel of technology. Superbly designed and laid out, a triumph of engineering."
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,3.0,,"The Cloud forest was very interesting to see as part of the Gardens by the Bay - if it were a stand alone attraction, I probably wouldn't go to see it but as it was in the Garden, it is certainly worth seeing. Very green, large display!"
,,Superb indoor display,5.0,,This display of plants boasts the worlds highest indoor waterfall. It is a beautiful mix of plants with some superb wood carvings enhancing the displays. There are nine different zones featuring plants who's natural environments extend up to 2000 metres. The waterfall adds to the mists and you may feel like you are high up in the mountains. An aerial walkway adds to the experience.
,,In the clouds,5.0,,This garden experience is one of two major greenhouses at the Gardens by the Bay and requires the purchase of tickets to enter. The thinking behind putting a major waterfall in a green house is nothing short of genius. It allows a wide variety of plants to be grown from ferns to orchids to nepenthes and many others beside. You will find many surprising exhibits to see and experience but the high walks are not suitable for anyone with a heart condition or a lung disease. You will find lifts and escalators in some sections but there is still quite a lot of walking if you want to see everything. Great experience..
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"While enjoyed both the Flower dome and the Cloud Forest, it's the Cloud Forest that I really remember. It's a multi-tiered Kew Gardens, with a pretty impressive waterfall in the middle of it all. Overall well worth the price of admission. People with a well-developed fear of heights should note there are parts of the walkway where the floor in steel mesh, which might be unsettling to walk over."
,,Amazing Cloud Forest!,5.0,,This was my second visit and it was still as enjoyable. The varieties of plants never fail to astound me. The waterfall at the entrance is so effective especially for first timers.
,,Not what you expect,5.0,,"Not being an avid gardener, I thought this may be like any type of botanical garden walk. No it's not, it's fantastic, I wish I had made the time to see all the domes, next time......."
,,Interesting Cloud Forest,4.0,,We do find the cloud forest rather interesting. It is quite an educational visit too. The atmosphere inside is a good experience for us.
,,beautiful and unique garden with exotic flowers.,4.0,,a good place for photographer to take picture of the flowers and plant that are decorated to the top like a small hill.
,,great idea,5.0,,I loved this. Really enjoyed this little adventure. We got the dual park entry and did the flower dome and cloud forest in one hit. We went during the day and decided to do the skywalk at night to enjoy all the lights.
,,The best thing in Singapore,5.0,,"Don't miss this amazing structure along side the other flower garden dome. This structure will amaze you with it's sky high cat walks, amazing views of the city and Marina Bay Sands. Gorgeous plantings, flowers, waterfalls."
,,Great scenery,5.0,,"Strolling thru the dome in a cool cool env. There is a man made waterfall right at the entrance to welcome visitors. As u walk up or down the slope, u can see hundreds of plants n flowers and out thru the glass pane is the sea scenery to the horizon.great scenic place for relaxation n learning more abt plants."
,,The Water Falls was awesome,5.0,,Extreme feat of engineering to build and maintain this place. Excellent! The Water Falls was awesome. The whole huge place was air-conditioned. The greenery was fresh!
,,Simply Spectacular!,5.0,,"This garden dome is a must see. The plants are amazing, the waterfalls are spectacular and the art work and carvings are just beautiful. From the top there are views over the city through the vast windows and the walk down through the cloudy, misty trails is both beautiful and relaxing. There are lifts and escalators so walking and access is easy. A fabulous way to spend a few hours."
,,Singapore updates,4.0,,Stunning display of inovation & nature combined togather. You would never expect a small city like Singapore to have such grandeur showcase of nature.
,,Uniquely Singapore,5.0,,"If there were 3 places you must see in Singapore, this is one. Last week, I was there with a friend from Switzerland who was well traveled. He was so impressed that we went back there again after dinner. The waterfall, the plants, the art pieces, the temperature and the structure are well blended to give you an amazing experience. So don't miss this place if you visit Singapore."
,,Impressive structures a little pricey at $28.00,5.0,,"The structures are impressive,though the whole thing is just grabbing money from you if it can. Extra fee for the shuttle.extra fee for photos,extra fee for walking above the canopy. Save your money"
,,escape from tropical island feel the cloud forest,5.0,,Singapore lies in tropical island with hot and humid weather. If you want to escape from this please go to cloud forest. I almost cannot believe that this is in Singapore. The view is breathtaking. they really bring cloud forest to tropic
,,Really cool,4.0,,Brilliant design and a nice cool break from the scorching Singapore sun! Very pretty indoor waterfall.
,,Absolutely stunning!,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is amazing! Fair warning: If you are scared of heights it might not be your cup of tea. I'm not terribly enthused by heights but I managed and I even looked down a couple of times while up on the cat walks! We hit the dome right when it was misting time which was perfect. Might be a good idea to bring a light jacket or a towel if you decide to get to close to the falls - you'll be freezing afterward due to the AC.
,,There's nothing to compare!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a place to behold. In my travels, I've don't think there's something similar to this. The architecture is a magnificent blend of art and engineering. You have to see this place!"
,,great!,5.0,,"it was awesome my family was delighted and satisfied with seeing artificial waterfall, beautiful sightseeing?! the atmosphere was good"
,,Not bad,3.0,,Interesting welcome by a big waterfall. We enjoyed this but wished we wore something warmer.... sky walk was cool for young kids
,,Unique experience.,5.0,,A cool area to get away from the heat and to experience the flora and fauna. It is easily accessible via Bayfront MRT and via Marina Bay Sands
,,"The building architecture is impressive, both from the outside and the inside. The concept and development is fabulous.",5.0,,"Arrive early afternoon, because inside the temperature is controlled so it is a perfect relaxing way after a day of sightseeing under the equatorial Sun. Also, if it is rainy, then rush there as you do not get wet. The inside gardens are impressive, well distributed, easy to access for all, and it is easy to get around. Enjoy!"
,,Cheshiresupermum,5.0,,This is part of the gardens by the bay. Lovely to walk round if you don't like heights the walkway down does have grates where u can see down below. Just keep looking up and you'll be fine as I don't like heights but it was amazing view etc and flowers so pretty
,,One of the best man made urban foresty sky,4.0,,"Must see one , able to Singapore economic heart from this sky view, in night its extra delightful.More importantly morning sedsion calm but nayural"
,,Perfect for a hot afternoon,4.0,,"We loved spending time here, it's quite cool and the view of the plants were spectacular. Although not a fan of heights, I still enjoyed each attraction."
,,Couple outing,4.0,,"The place is nice and cool with many plants and butterflies. As the viewing is from the top, it may not be suitable for those who fear of height"
,,Unique and beautiful!,4.0,,Beautiful place to explore! We were there for the misting too which was cool to see. They mist the forest a few times a day at certain times. Would definitely recommend a visit here when in Singapore.
,,Nicely set up,4.0,,A place with a lot of plants and flowers. Well set up but personally not my thing as I prefer real nature but wuth no other option in a big city as Singapore go and have a look and enjoy the diversity of plants and flowers.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Best place I've been to for a very long time. The setting the was amazing the feeling beautiful very tranquil. Felt very relaxed here. It's a special place.
,,Cloud Forest....Awesome.,5.0,,"We loved this experience, the planning is awesome, the artwork was second to none, and it was a fabulously cool place to be in all senses, one of the highlights of our holiday."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"This is the only word to describe this place! I was amazed to see how it was built to recreate the magic of cloud like feel. There was pipes running through that sprayed water droplets and it created an illusion of being in a could.

You cannot miss it!"
,,Lots of flora - interesting marina and city views,4.0,,"I visited cloud forest during a late afternoon break in my itinerary in early January and spent a very pleasant hour there. It was not crowded and I felt like I had plenty of room and time to take pictures and look at everything I wanted to.

I wish there had been a little more signage explaining the different plants and flower I was looking at, but the signs that were there explaining the ecosystem were interesting.

You walk in below ground level and then take an elevator to the top. Then you walk down a series of ramps and stairs to get a 360 view of the ""mountain"" inside the dome. On one side, a couple of the ramps jut out away from the “mountain”. Since I am sometimes skittish about heights, I thought I might have a problem here, but it wasn’t bad at all. There were some terrific views of the marina, the city, and the oncoming thunderstorm. I was also impressed by all of the tree root sculptures placed all around.

As others have recommended you should absolutely try to organize your visit to sync with one of the ""misting"" times. It really does add to the experience. At the time of this review, they were misting at 10.00am, 12.00pm, 2.00pm, 4.00pm, 6.00pm, 8.00pm. The current misting times are posted on the gardens by the bay website.

I purchased a ticket only to the Cloud Forest since I did not have time to view the Flower Dome. The cost was 16 SGD. You can buy a combo ticket for both domes that is cheaper than buying them separately."
,,Incredible,5.0,,This place is like walking in a tropical dream. The construction itself is spectacular and the flowers are incredibly beautiful. Make sure to stay long enough for the waterfall. The top area may be a little uncomfortable for people afraid of heights.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is simply stunning. The plants and overall design of the dome was just beautiful. Lots of photo-worthy scenes.
,,An Amazing Afternoon in the Clouds.,5.0,,"I have to be honest. When my wife said she wanted to visit here while on a recent holiday I was a bit like, ""Yeah whatever"" but thought I might be able to score some browny points so went along with the idea.
We stayed in Novena so caught the train which was surprisingly quick. (I highly recommend the train for getting around) Upon arrival we entered and I was immediately awestruck by the huge indoor waterfall and the climate. Not what I expected at all as it was cool but humid which was great. The information supplied about the cloud gardens was spectacular and the walk through the complex and down the gangway from the top was breath taking.
If you are in Singapore and have some spare time I highly recommend this for a visit as I thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,Truly awsome,5.0,,This was one of the things I wanted to see and I wasn't disappointed it was just a truly amazing building the was it was laid out and the plants was incredible. There was the most incredible thunderstorm and the water running off the building was mad then we found out that all this water is reused to the building and plants nothing not thought out . I would advise you to go .
,,Amazing and Thrilling,4.0,,"This space was amazing. As I am scared of heights, the high walk was a bit scary but nonetheless stunning to walk through an enclosed rainforest Space."
,,A Cloud Paradise,5.0,,I really love this place! It's definitely a paradise in a city! You must never missed this place in your itinerary.
,,Overpriced,3.0,,"The idea is great. But actually it's a little samey. You walk in and out of the plant covered tower, but there's little variety in what you see. I think it's a great tool for teaching kids about botany, and with context and explanation, it would be a great school day out. I actually found it a little boring and was looking forward to the exit."
,,Freaky Height! 🤢,4.0,,"If you are afraid of heights you can still enjoy here just don't go exploring the ""Lost World"" area of the forest which includes having the cloud view and the tree top experience of walking on a bridge that has the feel of a hanging bridge. The forest is far from hot. It's misty and cold (aircondition cold). The variety of plants on display is amazing!"
,,Worth to visit,5.0,,"It's really a right decision to pick this place for our 3 hours layover in Singapore. Everything is arranging so details so we can feel in the ""real"" nature. Anybody who visit Singapore, it's mandatory to visit this."
,,Impressive indoor waterfall,4.0,,The first thing you see is the impressive waterfall and the first thing you feel is that the temperature went from 32 degrees Celsius to 5 degrees. We had forgotten an extra shirt so it was a bit cold and therefore we did not spend more than 30 minutes in there.
,,Magnificent attaraction,4.0,,This attraction is a great credit to the people who first imagined that something like an indoor waterfall could be expanded to be this amazing.
,,Nice,5.0,,It's one of the best indoor gardens I have seen so far. The great fall is nice and beautiful. It's cold inside around 20 degrees. So if you are the one who afraid of cold carry a jacket before entering.
,,Stunning,5.0,,If you had to choose between the two I would do the cloud forest. If you have time to do both then do both. If you don't like to read I would get the headphones. We went at 9am right when they opened. If you are scared of heights I would refrain from going. My husband had a hard time walking on the walkway. He wouldn't go on the observation wheel either.
,,If you miss cloud forest....your visit to GBB is not worth!,5.0,,Please visit Cloud Forest and Flower dome Before you cover the nearby gardens in GBB.You can get awesome photos in the evening in between-4.00 to 6.00 P.M.
,,must see,5.0,,"It is in bay of gardens. There is a ticket. The visit is worth every penny. You could see all sort of plantation. More you go above in rain forest, the cooler you will feel. All sort of flower were there like orchids, birds of paradise, lily's etc. The place is totally covered and everything is artificially managed."
,,Lovely.,4.0,,"Visited as part of a, trip to Gardens by the Bay. Bit of a walk to the top by the time you meander up this clever construction so allow plenty of time. Make sure your trip includes when the misting occurs as this adds to the experience and the photos. Personally preferred the Flower Dome slightly more but definitely worth a visit."
,,Cool visit if you have an hour left to spend,5.0,,"It's well laid out and beautifully made, a nice spiral walk from the 'moutain' in a comfortable climate"
,,You must have lots of time to appreciate this.,4.0,,"After appreciating the flowers at Flower Dome,we went to see Cloud Forest late in the afternoon.The man-made waterfalls was cool according to my 3 boys and there were lots of photo opportunity because the views were great.You could see the Super trees from the top!If you are scared of heights,it is not for you.But if you love heights then Cloud Forest is your thing!Please watch the short video about Earth +5 degrees temperature,it is an eye-opener.We had to meet someone in Singapore so only the last half of the video was the only part we watched.You must not have another place to go so you could appreciate Cloud Forest.Worth going there!Wear comfortable shoes!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It is a wonderful place to visit. It is located in a very convenient location and is a great break from the heat and the humidity. We enjoyed our visit.
,,Don't Miss,5.0,,"Forme, this was the highlight of the gardens, spectacular waterfalls and Skywalker allow you to soak it all up."
,,Number 1 thing to do,5.0,,This should be the number 1 thing to do in Singapore. By far this was on the top of my list of things we did while visiting. Well worth every cent. Pays to buy the package for both attractions. Would highly recommend this as one of your must see things when visiting Singapore.
,,A waterfall you can be part of!,5.0,,Impressive on first view and then to be able to walk up all along and in and out of this waterfall was a great experience!
,,Gr8 way to experience a modern rainforest,4.0,,This is a unique way to experience rainforest environments and the flowers and plants associated with them. Very good for kids as there are plenty of exciting walkways to keep them engaged. Pair this with a trip to the botanical gardens to experience the modern and traditional approaches to parks and gardens
,,incredible indoor experience,5.0,,"nestled in the Gardens by the bay, the cloud forest is an indoor rain forest experience. an elevator takes you to the top and you wander down taking in all the unique flora and fauna"
,,Nothing much,3.0,,Maybe because I visited there at night time so I felth nothing much good for the forrest. I think the ticket value is not worth or maybe should visit on day time to get better view and photos. It's cold inside though so not to worry about the hot weather
,,Visit together With The Flower Dome,4.0,,"If you visit the Flower Dome, make sure you also go to the Cloud Forest. It is an amazing structure with a very huge selection of plants. The view from the top is quite amazing."
,,Out of the world!,5.0,,A truly unique experience. A must do inside the gardens by the bay. Do check out the timings when they would release mist to form clouds. Thank me later! :)
,,Great time,5.0,,I got a pass to visit both of the 2 domes and while the garden dome is averagely interesting the cloud forest is brilliant and the much better of the two in my opinion. Definitely visit this dome at least
,,Must see,5.0,,"Really nice presentation, including orchids, huge waterfalls and a cool place to be. Very refreshing from being outside in the midday heat. By the combo ticket and also explore the flower dome."
,,Waste of Time and Money,3.0,,"If you don't have a lot of time in Singapore, I would not recommend you to go here. It is expensive (because you can only buy a ticket for the 2 ""pavilions"", the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, which is 28SGD per person) and it is not interesting. They try to explain you some things about cloud forests around the world and global warming, but it is not well-conceived. Basically, it's an artificial forest with beautiful plants, but it's not worth the money. And it was freezing inside (well, it's a ""cloud forest""...), so maybe take something warm with you."
,,again man made nature....a con,3.0,,"cold, and artificial. i personally prefer real nature and not such a cold environment. they dont warn you in advance. i went with elderly parents and we had to come right out - and they didn't seem to understand that such cold without knowing is no good for anyone"
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"Amazing trees, waterfalls and a lot of plants to see. A gorgeous place to spend an afternoon when the whether is hot."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"One of the highlights of our trip, creative over the top, like Disneyland for adults but great for a family outing. Affordable clean imaginative unique a definite visit if in Singapore"
,,The best of the domes to visit!,5.0,,I think this is the more interesting and impressive of the bio domes to visit whilst at Gardens by the bay. Breathtaking flora and a stunning waterfall. Plus the conservation and eco education is good.
,,Impressive Indoor Waterfall and garden,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a unique experience (and a great escape from Singapore's heat!) The waterfall itself is captivating from ground level, then as you walk up the interior you appreciate both the natural aspects of the garden and the technical aspects of its construction. There are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, and information to read about different aspects of the garden. The Cloud Garden is also home to works of garden art made from wood, stone and metal, and when we visited there was also a lego plant section!"
,,Unique and interesting,5.0,,"The indoor gardens are a unique and beautiful structure, easy to walk around, and complimented by a large outdoor area to explore. A great attraction."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Great place and easy for wheelchair users and pushchairs. Great teaching and beautiful carvings throughout. Don't forget your cameras.
,,Lovely escape from the heat.,5.0,,"It is very cold inside.
My family has teens and a young school grader.
They all enjoy reading the descriptions on each tree, moss, and even carnivorous plants, on different levels of elevation. A good learning afternoon together.
We do not really like the over-the-top presentation about global warming, though. Should use the space and videos on more lessons on the highlights of the plants per level instead, perhaps. Or to review what we have learned as we went up and down the cloud forest earlier. Just a thought.

We walked slowly and could finish it in about 2-3 hours.
Awesome and not to be missed when you like nature"
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,As you enter you feel the water of the waterfall and the beautiful blooming orchids. It makes you a bit chill. the sky walk provides you an opportunity to see the trees from top and also a magnificent view of the surroundings. View in the evening is more mesmerising.
,,Some Plants in a room,2.0,,"way overrated , I did not have any fun at all...

it is just some plants in a big air conditioned room , nothing written next to each plant but the name , place is crowded with tourists some country that do not respect others.

I regret the money and time spent there

we have better parks in Australia and for free"
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,This is the must do attraction in Singapore. I have been twice and love it. Suitable for all ages and fitness levels as you get a lift up and once you have walked around there is an escelater down.
,,Very good,5.0,,Went in am. Lots to see inside and great views of singapore. .climb up but lift and etc available. Humidity high. Something different. Flowers and vegetation terrific variety. Caught mrt there
,,One of a kind!,5.0,,This is a must see! What a beautiful sight! There is a new sight around each corner! There is an elevator if the walking is too much.
,,mindblowing,4.0,,to experience a forest right in the heart of the city is quite an experience. its wonderfully designed and gives you an experience of a different type.
,,amazing,5.0,,"so many flowers, orchids, rhodedendruns set in a walk with waterfall, and many surprises. Marvellous colours. Worth time and money.,"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,This was a great attraction as much for the views and the architecture as the plants themselves. Not great with heights so stayed to the Centre viewing areas but brilliant for all ages
,,Just beautiful !!,5.0,,"I know it is artificially forest but the level of the details, the waterfall, lighting and A/C systems, the plants that they have to look after and the glass dome with the city backdrops, it is like we haven't experienced this before. I would personally see it at night time but would imagine that day time , it would be equally stunning! It was pretty busy but we didn't feel too crowded or rushed. The last bit was a bit depressing when we walked through the secret garden where the Climate Change and Global disaster exhibition is happening! It gives us lots of necessary info that we are all responsible to our actions! The souvenir shop at the end said different story! Sadly it sell stuffs that don't relate to the exhibition that we just saw. I would hope that it would take the opportunity to send further message and be more clever and interesting than that!"
,,Best thing in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing man made gardens with some interesting climate change information as well. The flower garden wasn't as good.
,,"Fantastic, don't miss this !!!",5.0,,Six of us toured all of the Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest. The Forest and the Flower Dome have entrance fees but it is so worth the fee and time to visit this awesome exhibit!! So gorgeous and educational with an exceptional design throughout. This place is so unique and a definite must see!!
,,THE BEST,5.0,,"I don't want to write the entire review in caps even though I'm very tempted to BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO COOL!! You walk into a dome expecting something cool, which it totally is, but so much cooler than in the pictures! It's very wide and if you walk on those bridges you'll feel so small but so free, like Moana when she's sailing alone singing ""I AM MOANAAAA"", I digress. Definitely recommend you spend an hour or so here, so much to see, so much to capture."
,,Artificially forest,5.0,,As per my visiting experience well arranged cloud forest in Sri Lankan we are having natural forest better than this.
,,BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,This is one of the Domes at Gardens By The Bay and offers spectacular waterfalls and gardens to enjoy.
,,Good to overwin your fear of heights,4.0,,Beautiful plants in a special environment. Very nice visit to this big dome. You can descent from above with an air bridge with possibility to look down......
,,Water and plants,5.0,,This is an incredible tourist attraction. Featuring thousands of different trees and an amazingly lit waterfall.
,,"An amazing site, with an easter egg hunt",5.0,,"We visited the cloud forest with an eye to seeing the plants - but the presentation alone was worth the price of admission. The multistory structure and the walkways, the ponds, the hidden corners.

And best of all - the easter egg hunt for the carvings (see my pics) - there were numerous wood carvings scattered around the foliage. Some were easy, some harder to spot, but all were amazing by themselves."
,,A pretty cool area the Cloud Forest is.,5.0,,I enjoyed the visit to the Cloud Forest. It's a very interesting concept. Walking around the different levels and taking pictures is an enjoyable time. Both of these are a must if you are visiting the Gardens.
,,Must check this out,5.0,,This place was amazing. Was quite surprised and enjoyed everything that was inside to see. Was also great on a hot day
,,Amazing time,5.0,,"If you only have a few days in Singapore, make sure you visit the Gardens by the Bay and purchase a ticket for the Cloud Forest (which also gains you access to the sister location, Flower Dome). On a hot day this is a god-send."
,,Cool visit,5.0,,"Wow, it is so cool inside after the heat of singapore, this place will also take your breath away. Going up and up and then the walkway down with a different view constantly. Well worth visiting."
,,Misty Cool!,5.0,,"I fell in love at the entrance with the gentle spray from the waterfall as you walk in. Then you move through the winding walkway exploring all the plants, woodwork, statues, etc. Keep an eye out for plants from home and measure how well they're doing here compared to your garden, lol. Keep an eye open for the wood statues throughout also our you'll miss one! Don't touch the orchard flowers...."
,,Must visit!!,5.0,,"I actually saw the Singapore Cloud Forest on National Geographic one week before I left and looked forward visiting it. Entry price is 16SGD which is a bargain for this impressive state of the art piece of artificial nature. You come from +30degrees into a controlled temperature of below 20degrees which knowing Singapore's climate is already nice. Going all the way up with the elevator and start your hike down with a beautiful view over the bay, the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Solar ""supertrees"". Something you've never seen before I'm sure. The combination of the huge waterfall, the various plants and the moisty/cold atmosphere will actually make you believe you are in a tropical rain forest."
,,Worth a look while your at Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"We purchased a combined ticket which included the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest.

It was very striking, particularly when walking in, getting your first view - however it was really just a vertical garden with an areal walkway and some information about the environment.

I enjoyed the walk through, but I think you can knock this attraction out in 30-40 minutes. I felt Flower Dome had far more to look at and photograph - we spent more time in that dome.

A few things to note:
• the temperature is quite cool inside so it's great if you need to escape the Singaporean heat
• if you get too close to the waterfall you can get damp
• if you have difficulty with heights the aerial walkway might be a problem - it's quite high and in places very unnerving (there are points where you can get the elevator back down if you decide it's not for you).

I'm glad we did both, it was fairly inexpensive 35$S I believe (Jan 2017) and pretty spectacular."
,,Spectacular. Must See!,5.0,,What an experience to walk this dome /cloud forest and take in all the natural beauty of the species and flowers/plants plus the contrasting glass architectural dome. It's a masterpiece
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,Our friends took us here to tour around and it's a must see for sure . Take your time and stroll around and enjoy the air and scenery. Love
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Great place to visit, amazing design, wonderful plants, definitely a must go to places in Singapore."
,,Very cool escape from heat,4.0,,A very unique feature that is an escape from the heat and/or rain of Singapore. The orchids inside are beautiful.
,,Spectacular...,5.0,,"We spent hours wandering around in the cloud forest, relaxing while enjoying the sounds, vegetation and beautiful views of the city."
,,Superb,5.0,,Great service and very warm feeling. Keep it up your good job. It was great time spent with family. Great bonding and wonderful experience.
,,"Wonderful place, superb waterfalls",5.0,,"A great place to be and must see attraction in gardens by the bay. Offers stunning views, awesome display of flowers and beautiful indoor waterfall."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Beautifully depicted rainforest and waterfalls. Gradual climb and lift take you to the top of the conservatory for wonderful overall view. Well worth a visit.
,,Worth a vist,5.0,,"We went in both domes and this one was the more impressive one with the multi story waterfall - fantastic!

You feel really high up, in fact there are a couple of escalators inside the waterfall to get you back down because the gentle slope of the walk ways would take too long."
,,Best a/c if u need to beat the heat,4.0,,"What a beautiful place to walk around on a hot day, full of flowers tress and the most amazing inside walk around water fall which hits u first as you walk through the doors.

Can spend a good amount of time looking around all the different types of flowers and exploring this place."
,,Impressive setup,5.0,,"Recreation of apparently completely self sustaining rain forest with extensive display of respective flora. Also covered in a quite dramatic manner are effects of global warming. Highly recommended but purchase tickets before online (although horrible ie non responsive design mobile UI experience). As with many other attractions there is no way to purchase tickets at a kiosk or with a WiFi powered ticket solution for mobile phones, which is easily possible (I work for a company with respective solutions). Most tourists likely don't have mobile internet on phone Rather customers are forced to waste time queuing. Not fit for 21st century..."
,,Tranquility,5.0,,Biggest indoor waterfall right at your eyes the moment you step into this place. Love the trail path that leads to the top of the cloud. It's simply beautiful.
,,Beautiful waterfalls,5.0,,Amazing place beautifully looked after and clean. As part of gardens by the bay this is good to see before the light show. A must see
,,"An enjoyable walk through the clouds and beautiful trees, plants and flowers",4.0,,This visit proved to be better than expected. The variety of plants is amazing. The structure and overall effect of this Dome is very impressive. An impressive and informative educational section towards the end of the walk was a nice surprise.
,,Beautiful mashup of nature and modern architecture,5.0,,"Engineered to simulate the climate of a cloud forest up in the mountains, so expect this place to be cold (Same goes for the Flower Dome). Bring a light jacket. This is experienced from the top floor going down. Aside from the beautiful plants, there are very informative exhibits, and a very eye-opening +5 degree presentation, which reminds us to do whatever it takes to make our planet a little greener."
,,Forest paradise,5.0,,Loved our experience at the Cloud Forest. There is stunning sculptures hidden everywhere in and among the flower beds. The waterfall is also a nice addition to this walk.
,,super nice,5.0,,"Its architectural building (if I can say it as a building, or a tower?) combine with nature definitely will make you in awe. Its breezy temperature will make you feel don't want to leave. Best part: the waterfall !"
,,Very good experience,5.0,,Cloud forest is one of the best attractions of singapore. It depicts a typical cloud forest vegetation in 6 stories. The experience itself is unique and awesome. The collection of flowers and plants is educative and informative. Would highly recommend it to tourists visiting singapore
,,Really well design,5.0,,"The place has a wow factor, according to me if you visit garden at the bay, pay a bit extra and visit the place, it has indoor waterfall, just check it out."
,,High in the mountains,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest simulates the mountainous regions and allows one to experience what it feels like high in the mountains as well as see the kind of flora and fauna that is indigenous to that area.

The larger of the two domes in Gardens by the Bay, the climate controlled Cloud Forest boasts the tallest indoor waterfall that greets you at the entrance.

Start your exploration in the Cloud Forest by taking the lift up and then walk down the spiraling walkways to admire the types of plants that can be found at various altitudes on a mountain.

Great adventure for the kids and young at heart with quite a bit of walking though it could be done at a leisurely pace."
,,Cloud garden magic,4.0,,"What a fantastic place to visit. The concept behind this is incredible and the carved art work a pleasure to observe and appreciate. The message regarding the earth, global warming and our future was quite confronting and a great reminder . Unfortunately the other half of this exhibition was closed on the day we visited so I will definitely return to enjoy some more of Singaporesingapore fantastic nature."
,,Must See Above the Flower Dome,5.0,,"We did both the Flower Dome and Cloud forest - if you have time for only one, definately miss the Flower Dome. We walked through the flower dome and at the end, our reactions without fail was - THATS IT??! Completely different experience at the Cloud Forest. Well stocked and planned. Great experience. Great way also to escape the heat or the rain."
,,Wonderful trees and nature,5.0,,An absolute must-do along with the Flower Dome! The views are gorgeous and it is very calming to feel connected with nature again
,,Beautiful and unique,5.0,,"The picture above gives a pretty good indication of what your in for. The cloud forest is stunning! Giant waterfall, secret garden, hidden statues and dragons (etc.), walking platforms from the top down...
Well worth the money, but give it the time it needs to spot all the hidden extras."
,,Big concrete carpark with plants growing on the walls!,2.0,,"Just did not get this one. Seems to be one of those cases of just an excuse to collect money from bored tourists! It's really just an ugly carpark with flowers and plants on the walls. Cold, Wet and boring!"
,,Informative & Interesting,4.0,,"If you plan to visit Cloud Forest just to watch the plants and waterfalls, go to the Botanic Gardens instead. The most interesting parts of Cloud Forest is the info signs. The theme inside the dome is consequences in the enviroment.They first describe a little bit about Gardens by the Bay (the park it is located in). They later go through what a Cloud Forest is. The route ends with an informative exhibit of the global warming, what is going on, how does it effect Cloud Forest which later affects us.

If you care about the enviroment, I would recommend it, but then you probably familiar with many parts of the exhibit.

If you don't care, I would absolutley recommend it, it will probably change your views a little bit if you read the info sings.

If you know that you won't read the signs, I would not recommend it, go to the Botanic Gardens instead, it's prettier, larger and free."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is an incredible experience. If you can go on the walkway. up the mountain.To be so high and be surrounded by plants is great. You can hear the waterfall thundering and be amazed at this man made structure that somehow seems authentic. There are also educational displays relating to the environment. A must do when you are in the gardens.
,,Sublime and educational,5.0,,"One of the highlights of Singapore, filled with gorgeous plants and sounds from the waterfall, great for couples, families, even travelling solo you would marvel at the design of this man-made biosphere."
,,Unique,5.0,,There will be much written about this place and I can only see that it's a must-see. Brilliantly presented and will live up to expectations.
,,Singapore is just absolutely beautiful.,5.0,,"I loved it all the mix of the old city with the modern, Chinatown was good, we also went to the Indian festival which was a bit of a let down but aparently the best time to visit was at the weekend."
,,So so so beautiful,5.0,,Definitely recommend the Cloud Forest over the other Dome at Gardens by the Bay. Really pretty scenes.
,,Escape the heat,5.0,,Walk amongst the clean green forest trees and be prepared to get wet as your lean over the waterfall to get a better view. It's hot in Singapore but in the cloud forest not too bad. Lovely place for a wander and walk and walk.
,,You must visit,5.0,,"This was a beautiful garden display. Nice and cool inside with massive amounts of greenery, waterfalls and just a pleasant experience."
,,Interesting and misty,3.0,,The cloud walkway was interesting but can get crowded. It's not something to do in a hurry. I wished that more of the plants were marked with identification tags.
,,you will mesmerize while opening the gate itself .,5.0,,such a lovely indoor forest on this planet . Dont miss the cloud walk in top floor with mist surroundings .
,,A forest with live waterfall from a mountain inside a building!,5.0,,"It is a wonderful experience to visit this man-made forest complete with mountain and waterfall, skywalk and beautiful plants all around. An excellent creation of architecture, forestry and ecology in a modern urban set up. Loved by visitors of all ages!"
,,Awe-inspiring,5.0,,"The very firs step into this dome is aweinspiring - with a 35 m tall waterfall greeting you. The atmosphere is very pleasing - not at all like what you experience in a real forest; yet maintains lush greenery with diverse flora and fauna all around. From the top, you can get the lovely riverview and a bit of cityscape. Do pay this a visit - worth every penny for both adults and children."
,,Exceptionally well made!,5.0,,"A stunning indoor feature of the exceptionally well made Gardens by the Bay. There is an entrance charge, which is well worth it! An elevator takes the visitors to the top. They then walk back down with spectacular views both left and right along the way."
,,Original as ever,5.0,,"While in the garden by the bay, why miss the opportunity to see the Cloud forest. That's a one in a lifetime. You are in a highly modern city but there is a dome with this in it !"
,,Cool and Beautiful,5.0,,"We went to the Cloud Forest when we were touring the Gardens by the Bay. While I was in Singapore, I found the outdoor temperatures just too hot, (being Canadian I am used to the cold). When we entered the dome, I felt instant relief as it is cool and moist there.

The gardens within this dome are also amazing. There are several heights that you can walk around on each with its own unique perspective. I really enjoyed this venue and I would highly recommend going there."
,,Surprised and in awe,5.0,,A wow experience and was amazed at the detail and ability to replicate a rainforest environment within a dome. Easily accessible and friendly to navigate at a casual pace with escalators available with lifts to ease the walking for those who might not be as mobile as others. A great few hours spent.
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"I really enjoyed wandering through the cloud forest and seeing all the different plant varieties. It's a really tranquil environment as you walk through the gardens and alone the suspended walk-way.

It was fairly quiet when I was there however I imagine it wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable if a whole tour bus poured in.

Tip: if you feel the cold then bring a jacket."
,,Cloud forest has my heart!,5.0,,The cloud forest and the flower dome cost about $28 us but is worth every penny. The cloud dome is spectacular and certainly helps us understand the environment of a rain forest and mountain. The art throughout the forest is made with tree stumps and it is spectacular. I could not put my camera down. The flower dome was hours. As hours of relaxing walking and sitting among the beautiful flowers. I used my macro lens and can't wait to work on the final photographs. Beauty surrounds you in both locations. They are big open late. It get there at 4-5 because the light is perfect and as you wind down the path of the cloud forest you can see the Giant trees show out the windows and from above!
,,Awesome forest,5.0,,Built efficiently with a high 35m tall waterfall. Breath-taking mountain views surrounded by diverse vegetation and hidden floral gems. One time visit for sure.
,,Manicured garden,4.0,,Right next to Gardens by the Bay so you do these two together. It actually seemed surreal inside here because it was so cool and dry and the plants were so amazingly healthy and arranged so well.
,,Cool Place,5.0,,I really enjoyed this place it was nice to get out of the humidity into the air conditioned comfort. The area itself is well laid out with different zones and great displays of colorful flowers and cooling waterfalls.
,,Indoor rain forest,4.0,,Amazing place real rain forest feel worth going all the way to the top of the waterfall. Superb carvings
,,Amazing climatic experience,5.0,,Step into another world. Look up as you enter and you wonder what you see. Good recreation of a waterfall and the misting was very real. The climate changes as you move along which was what we felt. I think this was real not imagination. Nice views when you get up. Very accessible if you are mobility challenged with lifts and safe walk ways.
,,A cool break from the heat outside,4.0,,A nice place that reassemble parts of the rainforest and its different zones. Beautifull flowers etc. and a lot of signs with information for the interested. Not that expensive either. You can easily spend an hour or two here.
,,Nice short trip,4.0,,I really enjoyed the presentation on the science behind Global warming. The wooden statuary sprinkled throughout this feature are very beautiful and most are photogenic also.
,,Really great if you are into flowers and plants.,3.0,,The experience is great but I am not a green finger. The complex is amazing and would definitely attract plant lovers.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"You walk into a large Atrium of flourishing plants and a fantastic waterfall. After the heat of the Singapore day, the air conditioning is definitely a relief. The structure is very high and if you are afraid of heights I would recommend staying on the lower level. There is a lift to near the top, though to reach the very top you need to climb one level of stairs. You then wind your way down various walk bridges and escalators to the bottom. In the middle of the structure are various geographical displays It is an amazing man made structure and well worth seeing."
,,Cloud Forest,4.0,,"It’s a calm and relXing place. Surrounded by trees and plants ☺ . It was extrmemly cold inside prolly because it’s (1) has a man-made waterfalls inside, (2) filled with plants and trees, (3) air conditioner haha. There isnt much to take photos with unlike the flower dome."
,,Supurb,5.0,,woww amazing loved the forest and its great on a warm day ...loved the huge range of plants that are in the gardens and some we haven't seen before
,,Amazing,4.0,,Did not know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised a great indoor rain forest and waterfall. The cloud walk was amazing. Definately a great indoor place to visit i really enjoyed it
,,Surprising!,5.0,,"The indoor waterfall was awesome. We went here after the already cooled Flower Dome, so the wind from the waterfall made it a bit too chilly. I would recommend bringing a jacket or something for the cold.

It involves walking on a high bridge around the structure from which the waterfall comes from. I am afraid of heights so I had to walk slowly around that - other people didn't seem to mind though. Despite that I really enjoyed this place and a must see if you'll visit SG!"
,,Another World,5.0,,"From the moment, you step in, you are in awe. Greeted by the world’s tallest manmade waterfall (which is a little detracted when you see how it is created…best not look), to the stunning array of greenery and flowers, it really feels like you have stepped into another world. After you regain your senses, you are taken to the top, from where you make your own way down a series of walkways and escalators, viewing many scenes largely focusing on tropical fauna and flora, but with some additional side interests added as well. Focus is very much on getting across a message of conservation, with your self-tour ending in a short spiel on global warming. An absolute must see."
,,Best Conservatory!,4.0,,Pick this conservatory over the flower dome unless you like lots of flowers! It's fantastic during the day but also at night when it lights up!
,,A step to save Nature,4.0,,If we follow the reading meaning of it then we can still save the nature. A great lesson to the visitors..
,,Amazing!,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is part of the Marina Bay Gardens. It has a wide range of lush tropical plants and does a great job displaying and educating guests about biodiversity.
,,Excellent!,5.0,,This was well worth the seemingly high ticket price! Really enjoyed the different levels and plant life. The educational movie near the end is pretty impactful and well done. Definitely worth a visit and easily accessible!
,,good respite from humidity and heat,4.0,,"IT is not a must see, but provides a good respite from the humidity of outside. Looking behind the waterfall was interesting and you got to see some carnivorous plants as well"
,,An unexpected must see!,5.0,,"I'm so glad I decided to see this before I left Singapore. What a beautiful and unexpected surprise, great for photos and to just wander around at your own pace."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Amazing experience of an inhouse waterfall. Mist show is good but does not fill the dome to the full. 5 degree plus give you food for thought.
,,Lovely a must see experience!,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay. So green, so colourful, so lovely to walk around. The elevator to the top and then walking down around and under the waterfall."
,,Beautiful way to spend a few hours,4.0,,Very impressive. A great way to spend a few hours even for someone like me that suffers from vertigo!
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome was the one we chose to visit. Cost $32 it was well worth the money and more besides. As soon as one enters, the Waterfall which is over 80 meters high can be seen, the spray dampens your skin and clothing as you walk past, and the sight of the orchids and other flowers is just a wonder. The strong message that comes over from this visit -where one can walk in the 'sky', is that of global warming and what will be the result in 2100 if we do nothing to halt the warming. We were overwhelmed by the effort that had gone into producing such an exhibit. Once you have navigated the swarms of people taking selfies and insuring that selfie sticks do not inflict damage to one's person, you will find this visit so warming. Enjoy!"
,,Where Architecture meets Nature,4.0,,"When we were in Singapore, we visited the Cloud Forest at the Gardens by the Bay. It was an interesting exhibit, although it wasn't overly exciting. The man made waterfall was a great sight, as well as the various sculptures found throughout the exhibit.

It's worth a visit while in Singapore, but it is catered towards Nature and Art lovers."
,,Amazing,5.0,,An oasis in the center of this beautiful city. Very impressing and very cold specially when there is mist.
,,Not bad,3.0,,"After reading all the reviews on the Cloud Forest, I was expecting something really out of the world. These high expectations may have somewhat coloured my judgement. First off it can get a bit chilly in there, so it might be a could idea to bring a light jumper or jacket. Buying tickets; I bought my tickets as soon as I landed at Changi, from one of the tourist booths. I spent $2 less than the official ticket price of $28 and I saved myself from queuing up. The structure is impressive but that seems about it. The waterfall and the huge variety of plants, makes it a pleasant experience. There are some short films explaining the eco system which are great for the kids and adults alike. As with the Flower Dome I feel one would be better off going to see the Botanical gardens if plantlife is your thing. As for people who suffer from vertigo, the very top of the waterfall is high, but as a person who suffers very badly from vertigo, it is doable, it was a lot worse going up the Marina Sands hotel."
,,A must if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Just that, you have to visit this if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay. It's cooling on a hot sunny day and interesting to walk around. Any kid will love it."
,,Bring a jacket,3.0,,"Can't say I was thrilled. Bring a jacket, because it's cold inside. Flower dome is better I think..."
,,Far too cold!,4.0,,"The dome is fantastic, but despite a cashmere jacket I was still freezing cold. It must be no more than 15° in there. I thought it was expensive at first for the two domes, but it's worth every cent. But do be prepared if you do not like the cold! Take your time as there are a lot of details to see. Watch out for the wooden dragons. My advice is go at opening time to avoid the throngs of tourists and locals. The outside gardens are as well much cooler early mornings and the light is better for photography. Nighttime as well offers a different perspective. With the same entry ticket you can go back again the same day, do not forget to ask for the re-entry stamp. Note that the outdoor gardens are free. You have to pay for the tree top walk as well with a limit of 20minutes. Buy the ticket in advance if you are going later, to avoid long queues. Enjoy!"
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"One of the 2 domes with plants at the Gardens By the Bay. While we are not at all into modern architecture this left us speechless.
Leave at least 1 hour to see the full ""exhibition"" - it is on 6 floors with an interesting 5 minute long movie downstairs.
As well as the art pieces inside were world-class!

If year are there at time when the mist is sprayed - it's fun too. Don't forget to clean your camera afterwards though :)"
,,Interesting,5.0,,Fun. Cool mist in air conditioning and organized layout. Very nice interesting information about plants and oxygen levels. Good to visit for garden lovers
,,impressive structure worth a visit,4.0,,within the gardens by the bay is this unique attraction. well worth a visit especially the extremely high walkway and the waterfall. great place to cool after being out in the heat.
,,Very Beautiful,4.0,,This was my favourite. Cool environment with lots to see & admire. Walk ways to make the walking & sightseeing easier. Spend the time being mesmerised
,,Garden by the Bay visit,4.0,,"Nice walk, lots of different varieties of plants, set inside a very large glasshouse. Large waterfall that starts at the beginning of the walk, great for some photos"
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,Wow! From the moment you are faced with the waterfall at the entrance you know the attraction is going to impress. The variety of plants is impressive and the displays are breathtaking
,,Very enjoyable,5.0,,"Well set out and air conditioned. The plants are all very healthy considering the heat of Singapore. A,lot of good information about the plants and planet and the whole gardens are a credit to Singapore."
,,Good but beware of heights,4.0,,"Beware of the heights it's super high. Oh and so many stairs but they break it up with lifts and escalators - you can't be lazy they only allow kids and disabled people in the lift. See my previous review of gardens by the bay it covers this - good, great photos, quite touristy and busy"
,,Amazing man made forest,3.0,,"This beautiful all-year exhibition is situated inside the Gardens By The Bay, and if you get bored after exploring the public part of the garden this is an ideal next step, but if you haven't got time to see both, I would recommend sticking to the public parts first of all."
,,A must see stop in Singapore,5.0,,"The Gardens by the bay complex, Cloud Forest, Botanic garden and supertree grove is a must to see attraction. You feel like you're inside ""Avatar"" magical world in real life. DON'T miss SuperTree Grove Light And Sound Show in the evening. Super recommended."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,Very informative about our forests and rainforests! And how climate change is affecting the world and what we need to and can to to at least help lessen the affect of the earth. Also they have a cool waterfall.
,,A wonder of the world,5.0,,A must see in Singapore and a fabulous display of plants from the high rain forest reasonably priced.
,,Amazingly Beautiful,4.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest in December 2016. Just the enormity of the huge structure is mind blowing and a treat to watch. Such a stunning structure.
Please wear a good pair of comfortable shoes as you ave to walk a lot.
The place is air conditioned and well maintained. Arrive early to avoid crowds as at certain points it was nearly impossible to take a clear picture without anyone crossing in front of you.

This is a must visit place if you love greenery and want to see something new and amazing.

Love this place and a the family will enjoy this activity."
,,Breath taking attraction,5.0,,"An amazing and informative attraction well worth the entry fee. You walk in and it's like the set of Moonraker in the Aztec pyramid. Beautiful water falls, living walls and you walk through the different levels to the clouds and above. Plenty to read about the natural world as well as thought provoking Information of the changing planet. All of this covered by a beautiful modern glass dome. A breath taking visit."
,,Waterfall is a nice touch,3.0,,"This attraction is just next to Flower Dome and both places require admission fee. If I have to pick one of them, I will select Flower Done. The only attraction point for me in the cloudy forest is the Water Fall. You can get some city view from higher floor level. Some of the decors look so man-made. For example, the Crystal Mountain. It is really a disappointment. So, it only deserves 3 stars."
,,A fascinating place,5.0,,Of the two conservatories - flower and forest - this was the only one open. It was fascinating from the minute we entered at the base of the waterfalls until we left. You get a lift high up into the rainforest and then slowly walk down through the different levels of the forest on walkways suspended in the canopy. Utterly fascinating. A must see. Very accessible for all ages and mobilities.
,,"Amazing place, its part of Garden by the Bay..",5.0,,"Amazing eco system. Garden by the bay has two domes. 1 is a with plants/Trees from around the world and 2 is cloud forest, an Eco system built around a man made waterfall."
,,Excellent,5.0,,This place is in the Gardens by the Bay and is a must see. It costs you a little extra to get in but is worth the money. Plan to spend around an hour in here as by the time you catch the lift up and walk down the walkway and stop to see everything the time just goes.
,,Wonderful part of the Gardens by the bay,5.0,,My favorite conservatory ! You will also really enjoy the cool temperature inside on a very hot day outside.
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,Loved the waterfall view and especially when you enter the place it feels so great as Singapore is hot and humid. Kids will love it.
,,A most!,5.0,,This is not only a most to experience Singapore but a most if you like a new experiences. This forest is nowhere else to be found. Walk along a big waterfall on a path that takes you to the clouds.
,,Surprising,5.0,,Loved this place. Didn't have enough time but will be back. Enjoyed the cool climate and the gardens.
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,"Humid but interesting place. Best part of gardens by the bay.
Loved the information about flowers and plants found at different heights up a mountain.
All of us liked it and option to walk or go up by lift was good.
Liked the pond at the top.
Views out of the dome were spectacular on this clear day."
,,Breathtaking!!!,5.0,,The waterfalls are stunning!! Must visit when you are in Singapore The skywalk and greenery is just amazing!! Very nice outdoor activity to take the kids and just enjoy the say out
,,"2nd time visit, and it's in December, it was cold. Must bring cardigan/jacket",4.0,,"This was the 2nd time visit to Cloud Forest. my 1st visit was during ""summer"" period which is the hottest period, thus the temperature was very welcome. However, at December period, it was rainy season and the temperature in cloud forest was very cold. Must bring extra jacket/cardigan if you plan to visit in November - December period.
And because this is the 2nd visit, Cloud Forest have not changed from my 1st visit. Great for 1st time visitors though."
,,Feeling good like real,5.0,,"Garden by the bay has 2 domes , 1 is cloud forest and the other one is flower dome both of the domes are stunning obviously , inside you feel like you stand in water fall at front and you can climb with life up there and a little sky walk around the forest make you feel like you are in movie"
,,Nice way to cool down!,5.0,,"As soon as you walk in there's a waterfall, don't worry though you don't get wet! It was beautiful throughout, lots of plants and really detailed descriptions of them all throughout.
It's a great place to escape from the soaring heat outside as it's so cool in there! Would I recommend it, yes definitely!"
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"It's next to the Flower Dome, and it didn't disappoint either. The artificial forest was brilliantly constructed. The tall waterfall was mesmerising. The mist created was quite mystical. The walk down from the sixth floor was greeted by many tropical plants and shrubs."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"Recommended to all visitors. The array of plants, trees and waterfalls transports you to rainforests of the world never visited. Provides a perspective and balance to those areas of nature that we are ignorant or dismissive about, Well worth the visit."
,,"Beautiful , memorable testament to Singapore's greening of city.",5.0,,Please see my Gardens by the Bay review. It is a lovely way to spend approx one hour in a/c comfort when outside is very hot and humid.
,,Exciting Attraction,4.0,,"Had fun going inside the cloud forest with my son & my older sister. She was very afraid of how high the ""stairs"" are while my son enjoyed it immensely. The mist from the falls was also a nice touch. Will definitely visit again."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. Very well presented. A whole world inside a massive greenhouse! And on a hot Singapore day it's so cool and refreshing. Don't forget your camera. Top tip. Don't pay for over priced meals here. Follow the well signed ""satay by the bay"" signs for a vast choice of good quality well priced meals"
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"We almost passed this up as the entrance fee is a bit high. So glad we went in anyway! This is an astonishing place. So worth the fee and time! World's tallest indoor waterfall is just one of the many amazing features of this ""eco-dome""!"
,,Very spectacular and interesting.,4.0,,Spectacular and interesting with large variety of plants in good settings. You get a lift to the top and then walk down and use escalators to get back to the bottom. Worth the visit but a bit expensive.
,,"A paradise,,,,,,!!!!!",5.0,,"The real rain forest paradise within a city.Make sure you bring your jackets it is very cold inside the forest.even if you have a small transit time in Singapore this is a must see attraction.you will find so many verities of treas and plants belongs to different areas of the world.and a rainwater fall with its natural setting.this is just amazing.if you have kids again , this is a must see......!!!"
,,so nice to cool down,5.0,,This place is amazing! Never seen anything like it. You can walk up (safely) amongst all this greenery and the waterfalls make it an especially cool place.
,,"Fantastic place to visit, its like walking through a lost world",3.0,,"Visited the cloud forest recently, we thought it was amazing, to us it represents the how the people of Singapore view the balance of nature and their city, working hard to keep the balance of their environment. Would recommend a visit for people of all ages, its amazing."
,,Feeling Close to the Forest!,5.0,,"An impressive place of attraction indeed. I felt like I was so close to nature, from the fallen water, the sound of nature, the smell of the plants. And all very edutainment, as I become more aware the importance of understanding the planet we live in.

This place gave me some kind of wake up call. To stay close to nature, especially for the city folks like me, I tend to be ignorant about our planet and other living creature or plants that give balance to our lives."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Wonderful display of rainforest settings. The orchards are beautiful and they alone are worth the visit.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Loved every moment of our visit. It is truly a magical place to visit. Not to be missed on your next trip to Singapore.
,,Enjoyable for kids and adults,5.0,,"An interesting way to learn about the effects of climate change, refreshing walk, beautiful flowers and plants"
,,A truly remarkable palce,5.0,,"Although it can be a bit crowded, it's so worth exploring the Cloud Forest. If you have time just to explore one thing at the Gardens by the Bay, this would be it!"
,,Gorgeous & Stunning,5.0,,How can someone create such a brilliant place so eco-friendly and natural. Cloud Forest is a delightful experience and an indoor jungle. The cool breeze and the waterfall will blow your mind away. It takes easily an hour to complete your journey inside the Cloud Forest and has a great view.
,,Different but in a very good way,4.0,,"One of 2 ""domes"" at Gardens by the Bay I think is by far the better one - we spent a lot longer in this one than the other. The first thing that struck me was the temperature drop that hit me when I walked in but you very soon get used to that and it is a very welcome reprise from the usual sticky, humid Singapore weather.
built round what can only be described as a mountain, the number of different flora & fauna is a sight to be seen - its' amazing. There is a huge waterfall, different height walkways - you are guided right to the top to work your way down - and lost to see, even my 2 boys were having a good time (especially on the walk ways) when they had been moaning about going in in the first place.
A MUST SEE visit when in Singers and one that we'll re-visit (possibly many a time) while we are here."
,,Must visit attraction in Singapore - Not to be missed,5.0,,Reach using the tube. Would require walk. Reach early to the Gardens by the bay. Cloud forest is an amazing place - man made but so well preserved. Do keep time to see all the exhibits - makes the visit worthwhile.
,,Wonderful Indoor Forest!,5.0,,Always love this enclosed forest! Love the main entrance where you are welcomed by the man made waterfall. Take your time to stroll and enjoy the greenery. Take the lift all the way up to the top of the forest trail and enjoy the view!
,,Too good to be real,5.0,,this place is marvelous. Specially if you catch up the misting. There are special times when the entire area is covered with mist and you will feel as if you are in the middle of a dense rain forest.
,,Awesome,5.0,,When in Singapore visiting the Cloud Forest is an absolute must do as its truly unique. Spent around an hour wandering through here taking many great photos.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing place with so many flowers and trees.. Good for educate people to love the nature and earth..
,,Spend half a day in the clouds,5.0,,"Lovely photo shoot opportunities here, nice a cool due to the climate control. Lots to see, bring good walking shoes and water."
,,Overpriced and totally overrated,2.0,,"If you decide to go to Cloud Forest, expect very long lines and to shell out at least SGD 70. For... fairly average kind of experience.

Save your money and spend that time in Singapore Botanic Gardens instead. Not only it is nicer there, there is no entrance fee."
,,One of the two domes in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,I personally preferred this dome over the other as it mimics the rainforest. Purchased tickets online through an agent to get a discount and skip the long queues!
,,Overwhelmingly awesome - the design gives one hope for the future,5.0,,Truly worth a trip to Singapore on its own. The engineering and aesthetic design is a backdrop to the most extraordinary horticultural display I've seen around the world. This was one over many moments while visiting Singapore when I realized the extent to which the U.S. is falling behind in civic inspiration. Don't miss the global warming 4-D infographic experience in the bottom floor.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Marvelous displays of plants, flowers,huge waterfall and high walkway to see everything. Amazing conservatory with moist cool temperatures showing plant I'd never seen before. Great place to spend a hot afternoon."
,,What an amazing experience,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest, welcomes you with the biggest indoor waterfall in the world, then you walk around amazing display of the vertical garden I ever seen. The temperature inside the garden is cool and very pleasant great place to cool down from the tropical heat. On the top of the structure there is beautiful garden with a small pond and carnivorous plants. Who ever tries to built something like this again this place will be very hard to beat."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,One of the most spectacular places in the Gardens by the Bay.. Walking down from the top level is most enjoyable.
,,Far superior to flower dome,5.0,,"Really good attraction, shame cannot go back to waterfall at the entrance. Much better than Flower Dome and well worth the visit."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,The Gardens on the Bay offer so much to see and the Cloud Forest has to be a highlight. Loved the architecture and general concept and attention to detail. Whether you are a nature lover or not I think this is a place well worth exloring
,,"Great for families , friends.",5.0,,"This is a great experience. Kids will love it and so will you. Quite a unique time. Nowhere can you find this. Music , lighting , fun people,out in the open air. Its not expensive,its easy to get to."
,,"Seems a Bit Hokey, but It's Quite Worthwhile",5.0,,"An indoor artificial mountain rain forest seems like a hokey idea. But the Cloud Forest is really well done. After trudging around the garden in Singapore's heat, it's great to get into a comfortable climate. Escalators and lifts do most of the climbing for you, while the plants avoid feeling ""constructed"" so the overall sense remains natural even though it's anything but. Well worth a visit."
,,such fun,5.0,,Loved the fact that you gat a lift to the top and then walk down to the bottom. Each level has interesting fact/ veiws
,,Lovely and cool,5.0,,We really enjoyed coming here. There are wonderful plants growing and we loved the large waterfall. It was so Cool inside compared to outside so felt lovely walking around. Plenty of good clean toilets available as well as places to sit for a rest. Well worth the cost of entry.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Amazing recreation of a rainforest. Must visit when in Singapore. There are multiple levels, each devoted to one aspect of what can be seen in a rainforest."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Walking in you are greeted by a wonderfull waterfall. While that is stunning it gets better from there.
,,Singapore Sights,5.0,,"Decided to explore one of the relatively new attractions in Singapore. Had a walk around ""Gardens by the Bay"" and WOW it is fabulous. It is so well laid out with different grouping of plants as well as some amazing sculptures.
Then bought tickets into the ""Cloud Forrest"" absolutely amazing. Singaporeans really know how to build sustainable attractions this rates very highly. I guess if you are not into plants, water features, water falls, and conservation it may not interest you. I guess it is something I really enjoy.
So if you have any spare time in Singapore I strongly suggest you visit the Cloud Forrest."
,,Cool,4.0,,Great view from top. The way up is cool there are many flowers and activitys to see and to do. It s not expensive and worth to do
,,Must do,5.0,,"Visit Singapore for already many years but this was the first time visiting the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the bay. It's worth every penny! Normally I'm not that kind of guy that will visit this kind of attractions, but this one was worth it!"
,,A feat of engineering starring nature.,5.0,,What a great way to experience the rainforest without leaving the city. A wonderful experience walking through every level of the forest.
,,Batonical Wonderland,5.0,,"This inside multilevel display of all types of tropical flowers is one of the very best. The numerous carvings, and statues add to this show place."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"A great way to escape the Singapore heat, this very educational indoor forest is set inside a dome. One of the highlights of our stay in Singapore. Gorgeous trees, flowers, the dome, the clouds, everything is wonderful."
,,Very exciting place to visit,5.0,,"It is so amazing place. If you like Avatar movie, you will enjoy this place. Journey starts with a waterfall and then will bring you to tip top of free and fall into underground through passages of roofs. Fog and sculptures will make you calm and forget outside world temporarily."
,,An amazing indoor jungle...,5.0,,"This is a very unique place. While coming down the mountain, one can enjoy the entire verity on display at the dome. Do not forget to experience the light and sound show at the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Visit to cloud forest,5.0,,This is well worth a visit. You take a lift up to the top and then climb some stairs before walking down the walkway and admiring the different plants built into the waterfall structure. It contains some very interesting plants and s a great way to get out of the heat.
,,Must see,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our walk through the Cloud Forest and learned a great deal. The experience is accessible, and a real eye opener if you don't know much about climate change."
,,amaz....ing,5.0,,"brillant , i said before , hmmm i dont really want to go see flowers and trees..... BUT , WAS I MISTAKEN , THE CLOUD FOREST IS THE MOOST MAGICAL THING IVE EVER SEEN LIKE BEING JURASSIC PARK...... anyway dont have 2nd thorts bout this place , get in..."
,,Vey pleasant,4.0,,Great time spent here. Very interesting but can be cold compared to outside. Fantastic carvings and examples of exotic trees and cacti. Well worth a visit and combine with the flower dome
,,Nice cooling walk,5.0,,It is a nice place ... beautifully constructed. Kids enjoy the walk and excellent view of city up on at the TOP Definitely worth going In my opinion
,,amazing view,5.0,,Singapore is one amazing place and cloud forest i would say is one of Singapore's prime visiting place. the view is amazing cant believe its man made forest.
,,Full rainforest in only one place,5.0,,I recomend it! You'll be able to see a great variety of plants in just one place and everything is well explaned. From the top you will have a great view.
,,"Amazing,",5.0,,"Visited here whilst on a 2 day break in Singapore. It is well worth a visit, absolutely amazing. Also worth visiting the gardens for the evening light show."
,,A must visit,5.0,,Different plants from all over the world and it's huge and unique. Lovely place to walk About and beautiful greenery. Love this place.
,,beautiful,5.0,,The place is a must visit for any Singaporean trip. Perfect for photo ops and has lots of fascinating things to see. Got a bit crowded as we traveled during school holidays but staff managed it all very well.
,,Forest Under a Roof,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest is a pretty amazing place to see. Take the walk all the way around to the top and see an amazing view of the bay. Set about an hour aside, it takes longer than you think. Also, watch out for people with selfie sticks. Way too many selfie sticks."
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,A wonderful experience to see a closed enclosure with mist all around. Waterfall there was amazing to see.
,,Amazing! If I would have only one place to see in Singapore it would be this.,5.0,,There are two alternative place to visit in the ticket office. (You can visit in both of those). We had only time for one place. I'm so pleased we choose this one. How in earth someone can build cloud rain forest! This is great one.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Breath taking indoor waterfall. Could spend all day. Amazing and informative. Use the shuttle bus as its a huge complex.
,,Take a jumper,5.0,,Great place to visit but be sure to take something warm as the temperature is quite alot cooler than outdoors.
,,Way up there,5.0,,What a great concept. The Cloud Forest is sure to impress. My suggestion is to buy your tickets either online or from your hotel concierge. You will save time not having to queue up. The whole Gardens by the Bay Complex is a man made marvel behind the fabulous Marina Bay Towers.
,,Cool biosphere,5.0,,This is a super nice place in Gardens by the bay with so much to see. If you enjoy plant life and knowing more about plants living high up on cloudy mountains this is a must. It is also nice and cool inside compared to walking around outdoors...
,,A Must See Attraction,5.0,,The Cloud Forest was my favourite attraction at Gardens by the Bay and is well worth the entrance fee. The fauna and flora are great and the waterfall adds a wow factor. Another winner for Singapore.
,,Very good,4.0,,Very pretty and we'll later out. The misting was great. Overpriced but everything in Singapore is! A good way to spend an hour or so. Much better than the flower display next door
,,Is okay but not so special,3.0,,Nice little place for a walk in an cool habitat. Been there late night. I think is not really reuired to see it but if you are already there why not.
,,Great- go and see it,5.0,,"This is full of amazing high skywalks on elevated walkways ( its adjacent to the ""Gardens by the bay"" and you get a ticket for both.
It even has a good go at re-creating a water fall. There are mist jets than come on every two hrs ( or so) and the whols place fills up with mist. really good to be up on a walkway when this happens- very ""mist""ical ( excuse the pun)"
,,Not a place to miss when walking down town.,5.0,,Located fairly close to the iconic hotel in Singapore inside the super tree area you don't want to miss this indoor garden. The design is very well done.
,,"Simply brillint, a must see in Singpore",5.0,,"Loved it, what a brilliant concept. The cloud forest is really interesting and truly unique with its walk ways, plants and exhibits. Well worth the ticket price and certainly one of the highlights of a visit to Singapore."
,,A place to go!,5.0,,"One advice, do not miss the place. They have done a great job there. Lots of plants, calm, beautifull things to see."
,,Blown Away,5.0,,"We went to walk around Gardens by the Bay, and only knew a little about the two additional attractions Cloud Forest, and Flower Dome. If you only have time/money enough for one Cloud Forest is the definite winner in my mind. Definitely worth a visit for nature lovers."
,,Another Must-Do in Singapore,4.0,,"I wasn't really sure what it was but tagged along anyway, 'might be some good photo's'. Glad I did, and I'd do it again on the next trip to Singapore."
,,Local Tourist,4.0,,Visited the huge aircon display. The man made waterfall that greeted us at the gate was fantastic. That was highlight of the visit.
,,Cloud Forest visit,5.0,,"Definitely worth the visit. I must say though, it's COLD in there. Take an extra layer. Spoilt it a little for us as we weren't told about this. As two of my friends were extremely cold they needed to leave sooner as they started to feel unwell!"
,,the best,5.0,,"cloud forest is amazing, in fact it's the best part in gardens by the bay, the mist makes you forget about all the opressing weather and it also shows you a lot about different stuff, just make sure you don't have a fear of heights."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"An amazing man made creation! The design and architecture up for display is truly stunning.

Not only is it a good place to take your family, it's also very educational and insightful. You get to see plenty of plants you usually won't encounter everywhere. The show they keep showing continuously called ""5 Degrees"" is something everyone should see.

The place is clean and well maintained with friendly staff. The best part of the Cloud Forest is the artificial misting! Do make sure to go visit before the misting times since that's once of the best things you can experience.

Also, make sure to take a jacket or hoodie because it gets chilly immediately after you walk into the dome!"
,,Boring,2.0,,Lacks the wow factor of some of the world's best gardens. I would recommend spending your money on something else.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Amazing place, a must see in Singapore. A cooling change from the outside heat. Well organised with lifts to the top and walkways"
,,Amazeballs!!!!!!!,5.0,,"I have travelled a lot and this is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen!
Don't miss it. we went when it was pouring rain think it was even more amazing in the sunshine.
It's is like being at the top of a mountain in the mist you wind you way down in and out of the mountain on elevated walking platforms. There is amazing plants and waterfalls and fantastic carvings everywhere!

Don't miss it."
,,Above Expectation,5.0,,"This is something you should go and experience. Words can't really explain what it is and what you experience.

It is also great to get you out of the Singapore heat and you get a great view of the City and Marina Bay Sands.

It is a tropical forest including waterfalls with walkways and paths that lead you through and around each section all in a large glasshouse. You can stay as long as you want to take it all in. Highly recommended for families with children as well."
,,Amazing - a Must Visit!,5.0,,Amazing is the only word that fits - whoever thought this up and made it happen was visionary. No doubt this will evolve as it is a living structure so each visit would bring out new things and ever changing experiences. a must visit!
,,Beeautiful waterfall,4.0,,"Very cool inside so make sure to bring a shawl or coat. The walk on the bridge is fun and you can feel the breeze. The waterfall itself is very cool and refreshing. If you visit Gardens by the Bay, must at least visit this place once."
,,Cloud Nine!,5.0,,"The cloud forest is definitely worth going to see. The glass house construction is impressive, not to mention the great flower and plant displays. You will need a good hour or so to appreciate all the exhibits.. There is a huge mountain in the middle you can climb and see exhibits inside as well as a giant waterfall!. Definitely worth a visit1"
,,Best place to be in Singapore to avoid the mid-day sun...,5.0,,"Gardens on the Bay are a magnificent spectacle. So futuristic ... and this is true of Cloud Forest. The green house is an amazing concept and the whole experience memorable. As all gardens in Singapore, the plants are perfectly manicured. The different zones make it interesting. If you visit make sure you are there for the cloud ""formation"" times. Also the contrast in temperatures with outside may warrant bringing a light garment if you do not like the cold...."
,,Superb reconstructionCloud Forest,5.0,,This was an absolutely brilliant beautiful experience of what a rain forest would be like. The flora was magnificent. It was such a thrill to be there when the mist system was turned on as it felt as if you were right in the middle of the rain forest.
,,Awesome gardens and something you wont see anywhere else in the world,5.0,,We visited this garden and yet again were blown away. Singapore has so many things to offer that you wont expect to see anywhere else in the world and this is just another great example. The gardens are gorgeous inside and is a very pleasant walk out of the heat outside. This is a very large place so you don't feel like it is to busy either. Cost to entre is very reasonable especially after you have gone in and seen all the work that has been put into this place. After you visit here you must take a walk around the outside gardens. The outdoor man made tress are incredible also!
,,Educational maze,4.0,,It's great for students and botanists but travellers like me find very limited photo opportunity but the waterfall spot. It's surprising cooling even on such a hot day due to its natural cooling system I guess.
,,Amazing mini waterfall,5.0,,"This is a paid for attraction and you'd need to get a ticket before entering. If you can, get here early to avoid the crowd for photo opportunities. During the middle of the day it will get crowded no matter which day you arrive. Take your time and enjoy the surroundings of the cloud forest."
,,Incredible!,5.0,,All about this place was surreal! I went during Summer and it's was like entering into a parallel universe with all that vegetation and the climate inside the Dome. Great diversity of plants and a magic atmosphere to have the views from the city outside.
,,Beautiful...,5.0,,"Beautiful work, the waterfall, the walk way, the green, the information and education. We spend sometime to soak up everything, come early to avoid crowd and don''t forget to look outside as well, you will catch the view of the city. We had great time."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,This was well worth the visit as its architecturally amazing as well as very cool inside (literally). We will definitely go back again at night or late afternoon. I took teenagers as well who loved it.
,,Visit Kinabaloo and be home for lunch,5.0,,"The ecological diversity and construction of this experience provide a surprisingly strong sense of being 'there', in Kinabaloo. The whole experience is very accessible to all. The plant-life is phenomenally rich and diverse, along with labels and explanations. The temperature gradient in the dome simulates the altitude changes and the onset of daily mists. There are static displays of limestone caves on your walk down. And all of this is encased in a dome whose construction itself is an engineering marvel. This is somewhere to take the kids, in strollers or out, and spend time in a cooler and interesting enclosure. I'd suggest visiting at the time of day when you just need a break from the outside heat and crowds."
,,Incredible,5.0,,Really breathtaking. When walking in immediately you are greeted by the massive waterfall. It done very well. i suggest taking the elevator to the top and walking down.
,,Uniquely marvelous,5.0,,"One of the great must see man made attractions of Singapore, apart from being cool on a hot day, visual stunning and very pleasing to spend time in, and will see an attraction unlike any other. Enter without expectations and leave feeling stunned."
,,A must visit!!,5.0,,We were amazed by its view. There is an artificial waterfall and a dense forest with many rare plants. Amazed to see how they form the cloud. Lost world is amazing. A must visit place.
,,One visit will make you amazed,4.0,,Experienced cloud forest with my wife last year before shifting to Singapore. it was in the evening and the lighting inside made it wonderfully amazing. a lot of efforts are put to make this place look so good
,,Rainforest teaser,5.0,,"Gorgeous development with a mere Rainforest teaser, gorgeous views and enjoyable climate make it very worthwhile."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"We loved seeing the Cloud Forest, seeing the amazing array of plants and marvelling at its modern setting. A must-see when you visit Singapore."
,,Very unusal display of the forest and flora,5.0,,This was part of the Flower Dome and it was again incredible the first thing that you see is this massive waterfall and then there was different levels that you either walk up or take an elevator to different levels and this gives you different angles and views of the outside as well as the inside. Only complaint again it was rather cold but well worth seeing. Could have spent way more time if my friend had brought her jacket but had to leave as she was extemely cold. I not so much.
,,Really spectacular and not to be missed,5.0,,Beautiful and spectacular with lots to enjoy. Quite cold with air conditioning so (surprisingly for Singapore) take a wrap or jacket!
,,Really beautiful and worth a visist,5.0,,"Good value for couples and families. Interesting, beautiful walk through a cool environment. It is worth going to the top and working your way down through the falls and flowers. There are plenty of attendants to provide assistance. There are lifts and easy access for disabled visitors. Very busy, I would recommend morning visit to beat the crowd and heat."
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited yesterday, and although not cheap it is definitely worth e money. Worth going early to avoid the queues."
,,taking your breath away,5.0,,"Admission to both domes: 28 S$. A nice get away from the outside heat. It's cool inside.Take a light jacket.
Take the lift to the top than allow at least half an hour to leisurely walk down. There is a very informative exhibit about global warming. The video about the impacts on wildlife in the upcoming years were heartbreaking. Can you imagine our world without elephants? Or tigers? If the human race does not come to its sense soon, you will have to....time is ticking away...."
,,Aesthetic,5.0,,"If you are characterized by a love of nature as a beauty, do visit this place. They have created in such a way that looks like a mysterious world veiled in mist. Breath-taking mountain views surrounded by diverse vegetation and hidden floral gems."
,,Head in the sky,5.0,,Great day with the kids in the Cloud Forrest. Walked through the mist high above the tree tops. The wooden sculptures hidden amongst the tree canopies are unforgettable.
,,Technology meets Nature,5.0,,"Out of the World. We feel like visiting Spaceship with nature plantation. Wonderful design, lovely atmosphere"
,,Gardening taken to a new level of perfection,5.0,,"Stunning design, with water features, sculptures, flowers of all descriptions and rain forest plants. Easy walking. Lifts to the top and ramps gently sloping down. Allow a lot of time, as there is do much to see."
,,"Overrated,overpriced but interesting crowded exhibit.",3.0,,"We went to the flower and cloud enclosures $100 for 1 adult and 3 children. They are quite interesting and a cool,dry escape from the rain but we were very disappointed overall and could not agree with Trip Advisors high rating. Was it worth the money?No. Was it worth a visit?Just"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"I was lucky to be with lovely weather, not crowded, and really wonderful to walk around. For sure I am coming soon Singapur"
,,Not to be missed in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited here with my partner and family during a holiday in singapore, so glad I visited to see the unique layout and variety of the cloud forest had to offer. On top of that though it was a great way to cool down on a particularly hot day!

It wasn't expensive and it didn't take too long to walk right round, there are plenty of photos available that explain it better than I can describe!"
,,Superb view,4.0,,Beautiful green indoor. It was cold when visiting. Better to go not in evening. Nice trail to walk but not much too see inside.
,,Beware of the height,5.0,,"This place is cold! Take a light shawl with you.
If you are not good with heights you might like to give the cloud walk a miss.
Otherwise well worth a visit. It's not cheap (S$28 for both domes) but at least some of the funds go to the upkeep of the extensive and free outside gardens. These gardens make for an enjoyable hour or so's walk in a quiet environment."
,,Wonderful and Not to Be Missed... Terrific for Entire Family,5.0,,"An incredible experience: a walk through a cloud forest in tropical Singapore. You'll walk along pathways that soaring many stories high around a central mountain covered in flowering plants, exotic plants and vines. A dramatic waterfall cascades from the top of the structure. You take an elevator up to the top and then stroll down , all the time marveling at the views. There's a nice exhibit when you finish your upper level walk that talks about impact of climate change and shows you just how ""green"" the Cloud Forest Exhibit is. The lower garden, just past the exhibit gives you a feeling of walking through a prehistoric jungle. Many wonderful carved wood/driftwood sculptures to enjoy! Nice exhibit of stalagmites and stalactites too. It is cool inside the ""Forest"" -- delightfully so. Go early to avoid the crowds."
,,Nice,4.0,,"You'll get nice pictures, long walk but at the end was educational. You'll get a lot of info of how self sustainable this park is"
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,"Excellent place and well worth a visit! We chose 'cloud forest' initially as cooler place to go out of hot sunshine. However this is a unique, interesting experience and would definitely recommend."
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,This is a great attraction which also has an environmental awareness theme that flows as you walk through the different stages. It has a great variety of tropical plants and the sky walk is fun.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Whoaaaa an entire forest artificially created.... lovely experience...totally awed by the brilliance of the makers.. definitely a must go
,,My favorite place on Earth,5.0,,"I had no clue what to expect when I decided to come here. Huge, giant waterfall, sky walkways, incredible flowers and plants. This place was amazing!"
,,Top Marks,5.0,,"This place is THE best thing to do in Singapore. I haven't seen anything as good. Brilliantly designed. Waterfalls, plants, sculptures, treetop walk, crystal cave and secret garden. Simply stunning."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"I have been to the Eden Project in England, I am sorry UK, but I think this is better. Entry to the Dome is S$28 - do it."
,,Breathtaking - Must Visit!,5.0,,We are still in awe of the masterpiece that is the Cloud Forest! The day we went it was pouring down rain and lightning so it was a great rainy day activity! Make space on your phone because you will want to take a LOT of pictures and videos!
,,Although not natural it is a great way to spend a hot day in Sungapore,5.0,,"We loved walking around cloud forest and enjoying the man made structures decorated with flowers, vegetation and artworks."
,,Cooling retreat,4.0,,Welcomed by the view of man made waterfall. Seeing a lot of different and interesting items. And even see a heart bridge if you raise your head.
,,"Beautiful, novel experience",5.0,,"You'd hardly expect to find such a thing in Singapore, but the cloud forest was absolutely breath-taking. Head up to the top and take a leisurely walk down, around and through the 'forest'.

If you had to choose between this or the flower dome, choose this."
,,Indoor rainforest - simply amazing,5.0,,"What a wonderful architectually and creative feature Singapore has created for all to enjoy. Loved all the rainforest plants, the majestic waterfall and light show. We visited in the late afternoon towards dusk and it was lovely to see wander around in the dim light, to feel the nature effects of a rainforest in the mist at this timeof the day After climbing to the top of the waterfall we could see through the glass to the lights outside on Marina Bay.

Just a tip - it gets quite humid inside as you can imagine, even with aircon working, so would encourage visitors to take water with you to hydrate."
,,Fun visit. Well worth it and nice and cool inside!,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit in December. A nice cool place to visit and lots to see. Impressive!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Catch the lift to the top and walk down the ramp and take in the views outside as well as the lovely waterfalls and orchids inside.
,,Good place,4.0,,You can find the artificial waterfall here. The place is very high. You can use elevator to reach the highest floor however you should walk to reach the bottom floor. Its very high. If you have a problem with high place please do not visit this place alone.
,,Loved it - especially the sculptures!,5.0,,"A lovely, cool place to explore, with interesting information on different zones up a mountain forest. The sculptures were amazing, especially the wooden dragons (and the huge cast bronze snail!)."
,,Amazing man-made tropical forest in an in-door experience,5.0,,"Amazing to see a tropical forest created in a covered space, containing a water fall. One can take a lift to the top floor, or to get a closer look, we can also walk up/down a spiral path available."
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,"We've purchased tickets to both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and between the two, I enjoy Cloud Forest more. You will be greeted with a waterfall upon entrance which presents a good backdrop for picture taking. Afterwards you can follow the path and climb up the stairs to reach the 'clouds' above. There are varied display of flowers and plants as you go up to distract you from the amount of walking and climbing needed. Overall, a unique experience and a good respite from the heat outside."
,,Just okay...,3.0,,"We purchased the double conservatories ticket (flower dome + cloud forest). We were just amazed by the waterfalls as you enter the door, which was unexpected and very freezing, thus, make sure to bring jacket or anything. Other than that, this is not worth the money. There were schedules though of ""misting time"" posted as you enter the door, which we missed when we went inside - not sure what it would be and if it could have fascinated us if we saw it. In this conservatory, you also have the option to go up."
,,An Artificial Mountain with a Rain Forest under a Giant Dome,5.0,,You must see it to believe it. My wife and I spend about 3 hours exploring the rain forest from various heights of the mountain. Fascinating is an understatement.
,,unexpectedly awesome,5.0,,"I went to the cloud forest because my wife really wanted to go and it was her first time to Singapore. I was really really surprised and impressed! It was a great escape from the heat and other worldly. I felt like I stepped into the set for Avatar. After you are done, keep walking down the street by the water to Satay by the Bay for some great food and Tiger beer."
,,Man made creation at his best,5.0,,Very pleasant made man dome with a real life feel to it. Good for family to take a tour and for kids to get a great vision of.
,,Must See,5.0,,Wwas amazed at just how cool this place was (in every sense). from the towering waterfall to the quantity and variety of plants this is an incredible place. Discounted entry rates if you do the 2 domes (which I'd recommend).
,,Amazing Attraction,5.0,,"This is my first time entering Cloud Forest, on my second time to Garden by The Bay. Cloud Forrest is better than the other one. The Indoor waterfall is amazing. Lot of photo spot here. Better you enter here when sunset, when the lights on, very beautiful and maybe romantic. Great value."
,,Spend a while...,4.0,,"This is an amazing place if you spend the time to enjoy it. A great collection to be enjoyed at different levels.

Lots of people about, rushing through, taking selfies - ""look at the plants, people!"" And how they combine together!

Also beautiful carvings and settings throughout - though I felt the Crystal display at the bottom of it all was a bit affected or unnecessary.

Ingenious structure. Would go again to see it at night too. That would be special.

Interesting, though not essential, to have the driverless transport to the dome. Be warned, one way only - though shuttles back are great. As would be a walk in the surrounding areas. Next time?"
,,Simply Must Do !,5.0,,We saw these being built during our last trip to Singapore in 2013 and couldn't wait to see them this trip. We where not disappointed and arrived at 4pm allowing at least an hour for each the Cloud Forest & Flower Garden domes.You do have to experience these to appreciate how amazing they both are. I also think it was extra special going on the 2nd week of December as they where dressed for Christmas. We also booked dinner at IndoChine which is a restaurant positioned at the top of teh nlargest Super Tree in the Super Tree Grove. This was our best highlight during this visit and I would suggest it to any one. You can also have a couple of evening drinks on the roof top bar 1st and watch the sun set with the Marina Bay Sands and city as your back drop ! Again there was a special light show in the Super Tree Grove each evening for Christmas and it was a spectacle in itself - Definitely a MUST DO when in Singapore !
,,Must Visit when in SG,5.0,,"A visit to the cloud forest would require a jacket or something to keep you warm because it's freezing cold inside.
The whole place is overwhelming, especially how they built the falls and the mini rainforest inside, it made me appreciate nature and it's wonders.
On the last part, they will show you a video entitled 5 degrees...
a very disturbing and touching video on what could possibly happen in the future if we continue to abuse our planet."
,,A Unique Experience Not to be Missed!,5.0,,"Whether you are 8 or 80, you will savor this experience to walk among the clouds! All of your senses will be exhilarated. Add to that is the beautiful flora of the exhibit."
,,Green,3.0,,Lovely water feature at the top but otherwise not that interesting but nice to be able to retreat into air conditioning.
,,Great value,5.0,,A must see in Singapore. The gardens that the cloud forest is in is a delight and we'll worth spending a day there.
,,"Overrated, wet, cold, plants....",3.0,,"If you like plants you'll love it, I personally found it boring and didn't want to que for 2 hours.

I liked the waterfall at the front entrance but you will get wet as it splashes you as you walk through.

Great photos as its lit up, but I don't think it was very interesting."
,,Live garden,4.0,,"It’s a huge conservatory simulating a forest and thousands of plants and flowers. It has the tree-top walking feature where the platforms are built to let you walk through different levels of the 6-storey conservatory dome to take a spectacular look. Recommend this place for garden enthusiasts.
the waterfall at the entrance is my wife's favorite, such a fabulous feeling, the sound and the spraying of water as it falls."
,,Nothing like it in the world.,5.0,,"Upon entry you think you were transported to a Disney like place. It is giant bio-sphere filled with amazing foliage and whimsical wood carvings. The park is huge in terms of ground space as well as almost 4 stories tall with a water fall.

The entire project pays homage to the rain forests of the world.

It is a must see when in Singapore

I"
,,Unique,4.0,,Went all the way up and down by elevator. Has path paved with glass too. Indoor waterfall was beautiful
,,Cloud? Forest?,3.0,,"Not really a forest or a cloud but a nice attraction. Very refreshing with nice strong AC. Good place to chill after sweating our way around Garden by the Bay.

EXPENSIVE / poor value for money really.

If you want to go might be worth booking tickets in advance online if you can to avoid long queues."
,,Dizzying,5.0,,"If you're not prone to severe vertigo, then this is a place you shouldn't miss. Tropical plants and flowers of all kinds in a towering waterfall setting. Also a cool relief from the Singapore heat."
,,Glimpse into the future & rainy day activity,4.0,,"We didn't book this attraction and turned up on the day. It is quite a cool concept and while most of the plant life may be lost on some people for me I felt this was a glimpse into the future of how our kids would likely see flora ""in the wild"". Very well laid out with a mixture of flowers and plants and trees. Great to see boab trees up close.

The rainforest dome was also very cool.

Once you get up the walkway Take the stairs if you can handle them up to the very top as the lift line is quite long with people and their Prams.

Also be prepared to be smacked in the head with selfie sticks and generally people stopping in the middle of walkways for selfies."
,,Beautifull Place in the city,5.0,,"it's verry a great place, seems like the real cloud forest, and so comfortable in here. you can see many things in the top of the tree"
,,A Forest in a Dome,5.0,,We had a very enjoyable walk through the forest. The elevated walkway takes you high up into the forest. Not to be missed
,,This place is amazing,5.0,,Although I had seen pics I was absolutely overwhelmed by the beauty of this place. Just stunning. Who is the genius that designed this Cloud Forest? Something to see at every turn as you make your journey of discovery through the forest. Totally surpassed all expectations. Just wow actually.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Must see for anyone who enjoys nature. Nice and comfortable inside the dome even on a hot day, wonderful elevated walkway and of course the highest indoor water fall is a must see."
,,amazing - highly recommended,5.0,,lost for words when i saw this . you have to visit to believe what they have constructed here. they have recreated a real forest with sub tropical temperatures.
,,Cloud Forest was awesome,5.0,,Great ways to enjoy a hot afternoon with family. Kids had fun and plenty to see including skyline from top walkway.
,,Pure magic,5.0,,"The Cloud Forrest was my personal favourite attraction at gardens by the bay. In every direction, there are lush gardens adorned with tasteful wooded carvings, waterfalls and pools.

The dome itself is and architectural marvel which juxtaposes well with the natural beauty of the plants within.

In all honesty, words fail to describe the beauty of this attraction. It is no wonder why it is so popular. Definitely worth a visit."
,,The Awesomest Place Ever!!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a refreshing experience and it keeps you fresh for the whole time. Whether it be a hot day or a humid day outside, the forest stays cool. It shows all the plants and flowers grown in high mountains. Very interesting and awesome."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,The atmosphere in the area was cold. Recommended to bring a jacket along. The views were breathtaking from the bottom as well as when climbing up the area. Don't miss the misting time! Definitely a must watch.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is truly a 'must see', it is so well done - cleverly designed, well managed and very very interesting ! The temperature is beautifully cool so it's a genuine oasis ! The natural beauty of the plants against the backdrop of beautiful Singapore is a treat!"
,,Elevated walkway made it worthwhile,3.0,,Title of review says it all unless you are really into plants. Recommend taking the stairs to get to top (where elevated walkway starts) or else you will be waiting a long time for the lift.
,,wonderfulwalk through the forest,5.0,,"Early in the morning seems the best time, it is still not oppressive outside and the crowds have yet arrived. Taxis are very cheap, and aplenty, in Singapore. I bought my ticket at the agency in the hotel and so saved a few bucks, and long waiting lines. There are souvenir shops and cafes, even a McDonalds. The cloud is a huge enclosed air-conditioned dome, with tropical rainforest walks, amidst waterfalls and beautiful views through the glass to the Singapore high-rise. At the end of the half hour walk, I was funneled through what can only be called a "" global warming political brainwashing"" which somewhat sullied the otherwise wonderful refreshing rainforest experience."
,,A nice place to see,5.0,,"If visiting Singapore, this is one place you must visit. There are two domes in Gardens by the Bay and this one I definitely recommend. The huge waterfall is a great photo place."
,,Freakin amazing!!,5.0,,"A mini rain forest inside a climate controlled glass dome! Who dreams up these things?? I wanted to go here as its one of the settings for the movie, Agent 47-Hitman. It really is worth a visit!!"
,,Very close to Nature Experiance.,4.0,,well if you want to experience nature then this place is to see in Singapore.a wonderful artificial forest including water fall is developed. Did enjoyed a lot here.t is a beautifully cool indoor area.the area is easy to access as lifts & escalators are their throughout. we visited both flower garden & cloud garden but loved cloud garden most.Overall it was very enjoyable visit we had.
,,"Great spot for a visit, especially in the heat of the day.",5.0,,"As soon as you walk into this structure, you are immediately aware of the peaceful serenity and then the cold air hits you....a huge waterfall keeps the air temp down to a very acceptable level, and as you do the walk around and through the hanging gardens, you get to appreciate the diversity of all of the work that has gone into this. I'm not a gardener, or even a fan of gardening, but this visit allowed me to see a lot of possibilities and potential at home so that the missus can start some serious planting in the near future. It's a very inspirational place to visit and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a short break from the hectic outside world. It's a little piece of Eden, in the middle of a bustling city...and a great example of what can be done to help our planet survive by nurturing our flora."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Leading the world with their environmental message and clever design. This is a must see. Recommend the mini train tour around the gardens to get your bearings and make it easier to get to when hot.
,,Nice way to pass the time,4.0,,We visted this attraction whilst waiting for the light show (Super Trees) There was some nice bits to see including the waterfall and the trek across the lost islands
,,A beautiful haven and a must see!,5.0,,"At first glance you would expect inside the cloud forest to be very hot! However it's not. It is a beautifully cool indoor area to stroll and pass the time away.

The whole thing is accessible for anyone, including the elderly and infirm as there are lifts and escalators throughout.

There is a fee to get in, however we feel that if we had to choose between the flower garden or the cloud garden, we would choose the latter.

Getting here is simple also, simply getting the MRT to Bayfront station and it is just a short walk away.

Overall a thoroughly enjoyable visit was had, and we would recommend it to anyone wanting to visit."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,Spectacular waterfall centerpiece supports an indoor ecosystem of flowering tropical plants. Quite cool compared to outside temperature. Wonderful sculptures nestled in foliage. Plan to spend some time to enjoy all aspects of this amazing 'forest'.
,,Very good feel in SNG heat,5.0,,Our kid loved the place and was so excited walking on the top. Everyone in the family loved it given the temperature outside. We belong to a place in hills and having that kind of feel in SNG is awesome.
,,Excellent Snapshot of Nature !!,5.0,,"This place is one of the best examples of showcasing nature within an indoor environment. The waterfall is stunning and is the centrepiece of the entire attraction. They change the theme once every few months so you can keep going there. If you plan in advance, you can get further discounts on the ticket prices as well by booking online. Overall, a wonderful place not to be missed..... !!!"
,,Wow it's COOL !!,4.0,,"Best time to visit is between 5:30PM to 8:30PM as the crowd is normally lesser and visitors are able to enjoy the changing views from bright daylight, twilight in evening and the stunning skyline of Marina Bay Sands and Central Business District at night. One of the few attractions in Singapore that is truly impressive, could be better if there were more seats available along the path for resting."
,,Great height.,4.0,,Cloud forest is one of the attractions within Gardens by the bay. A lovely waterfall cascades down the mountain forest which is covered in forest vives and plants. Top of the forest is reached by lift and has 3 accessible walkways to view looking down.Great if not afraid of heights. A must see in the gardens.
,,Primary 1 lesson,5.0,,"When we entered the cloud forest, greeted by huge water fall. This is like real water fall,

Just follow the route, we will learn what we got when we were primary 1 class, they teach us what plants grow at level 1000 what plants grow at 2000.

This is good for learning forests but need more for entertainment. They may create like a real stone cave so the kids and adult can enjoy walk through,"
,,Interesting displays,4.0,,Part of Garden by the bay attraction. Interesting displays of plants on a tropical setting and a fake waterfall.
,,Unique!,5.0,,"Bit chilly in some areas inside but quite pleasant overall. Elevators can get packed. If you have severe height phobia, best to avoid. Otherwise, a very memorable experience for sure."
,,Stunning Waterfall,5.0,,"The flora in this ""dome"" was simply awesome. With various exhibits from Lego Venus flytraps to Stalactites and stalagmites. The waterfall and the mist added to the atmosphere of the rainforest. I strongly recommend carrying rainwear as it gets very wet and cold."
,,Fun to see.,4.0,,Quite a feat of engineering and design. I was a bit disappointed that there was less to see than I had anticipated. Could be educational for those with little experience in different environments.
,,Put the phone away and immerse yourself!,5.0,,"Best to visit the Flower Dome first- as it is fairly straight forward - there's just the flowers and a million photo opportunities and a zillion visitors all wanting to take those photos (beware of low-flying selfie sticks!)
The Cloud Forest deserves more time (you could spend up to an hour easily enough) and deserves the respect of keeping your smart phones and selfie sticks out of sight.
Go right to the top of the Dome and work your way down, doing the various walks and enjoying the various exhibits.
This place is COOL... physically and educationally and even spiritually... no photos needed (but you'll take some any way, won't you...?)"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"You gotta go there....!! It is so beautiful. A bit pricey for foriegners though, but well worth it....!!"
,,Worth going to,5.0,,"Stunning! be prepared to walk and look up and down a lot!!! wheelchair friendly, quite a lot of slopes and places to stop for a breath if you need."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is one of the natural wonders of the world! The way the gardens have been created is increadible. We visit Singapore and come back every year and we are always amazed. If you are in Singapore a visit here is a must!
,,Simply Amazing!,5.0,,"This is one of two pay-to-enter conservatories inside Gardens by the Bay. Instead of standing in line on site to buy tickets, we purchased ours ahead of time at the travel desk of our hotel and were even given a discount. We walked all around...More"
,,Blown Away,5.0,,You have to go! You'd be mad if you didn't! We were absolutely blown away by this awesome attraction
,,A 'must see' experience.,5.0,,"Some of the gardens are free but it is well worth paying for a visit to get inside the domes. The views are great and there are good photo opportunities. The environmental message is self explanatory, interesting, informative and appeals to children and adults. We...More"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Amazing, really well designed and we'll run. Reasonable price - especially for Singapore. Well worth a visit - probably the highlight of our trip to Singapore."
,,Amazing Concept,5.0,,"I had been with my family in the summer of 2016. I have never seen such a concept of forest beautfully made , great imagination very well maintained."
,,Rainforest under cover,5.0,,So energising and peaceful gorgeous place to dwell awhile as you wander the pathways gently inclining. Fine misting sprays periodically freshen all the plant life. An escalator or an elevator can take you back down to ground level if you don't want to wander back...More
,,Must do at Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"We have been in the cloud forest 4 times over the past years but every time we enjoy the cool climate, exciting details to explore and the huge variety of plants."
,,Not a must visit place in your itenary,3.0,,"if you are not crazy about plants , would suggest to skip the place altogether. This place is usually crowded in weekends requiring detours and long walks. This can be avoided by paying a fee for tram 3$ each. You might watch pictures / videos...More"
,,One of the finest experiences,5.0,,This rates as one of the best conservatory type experiences I have seen. DO NOT MISS IT. I shall go back.
,,Man made Wonder,5.0,,See it to believe it . The Singapore government has spent lot of money create something out of the world experience. It was a fantastic time spent
,,Nice Landscaped Waterfalls,4.0,,"This forest is constructed within one of two glass houses with the Gardens by the Bay. It has some nice statues and has nice effects with the fogging created articifially.

The flora is interesting and there are pipes that make up the waterfalls but I fail to be really impressed by them. Looks totally artificial and unnatural. There is a collection of stalactites or stalagmites depending on which way they were prior to harvesting. There are interesting plants to be seen, but a small fraction of the plant house in the adjacent pavilion.

Worth a look around and if possible buy the combined ticket to access all features of Gardens by the Bay. On a positive note - the air conditioning is sublime - great for a retreat."
,,Cool and beautiful,5.0,,What a beautiful place to visit with the waterfalls and all the different flowers and ferns. At all the different levels that you walk it really is very well laid out
,,Something Unique Awaits Here,4.0,,"The moment you enter the Cloud Forest, you would be greeted by massive waterfall. Artificial though, but quite colossal. The crystal room is worth visiting and don't miss out the carvings made out of roots. It would take approx 30 min to see the whole place but remember to come during evening/ night time. Fancy lights would dazzle you."
,,Stunning,5.0,,The Cloud forest is stunning well thought out something for every one this is many stories and there are lifts and escalators very easy to get around start at the the top and work your way down
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is amazing natural architecture at it's best! Having always loved going to gardens (Wisley, Surrey, UK is one of my favourites!) this place blew us away. The waterfall at the entrance was spectacular but it's not until you ride up to the top that you fully appreciate how this has been designed. Lovely orchids, beautiful setting and wonderful views out across the Gardens to the Marina Bay Sands. The video in the base is very thought provoking. Definitely worth visiting!"
,,Beautiful and modern,5.0,,"These gardens are a must see. The cloud forest is amazing - very humid, but fairly chilly. expect to get a little wet while you're there."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Artificial rainforest. Amazed how it is created and maintained. A must see in Singapore. Need at least 4 hours. If you have less time then you will not be able to fully enjoy it.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The beautiful waterfall and orchids everywhere, you're surrounded by lush greenery. I absolutely loved it It's chilly once you enter"
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"I didn't expect this beautiful garden, I saw it at afternoon and night, lovely view at night, an elevator will take you to the roof, very comfort."
,,Nature in glass dome,5.0,,"Magnificent , enchanting and so very natural

Once the gates are open and you are in , cold breeze and waterfall will welcome you .

One can see the nature's best setup in this glass dome , you can take a long walk all around the garden from bottom to top .
Best part is that the attraction are friendly to wheelchaired person"
,,Must visit place in singpaore,4.0,,Kids will enjoy a lot. Better take shawl or jacket. I believe they maintain 10 or 12 C. It will take 2 hours to complete this trip
,,It's simply beautiful....,5.0,,"The atmosphere, the flowers and the entire experience was soo breathtaking. Do check out the pictures taken below"
,,A Must-Visit!,5.0,,"Its one of the two conservatories inside Gardens by the Bay. You have to pay in advance for entry. The tickets for tourist already included entry for both conservatories.
The cloud forest is a beautiful place. You should come during the misting time at 10.00am, 12.00pm, 2.00pm, 4.00pm, 6.00pm, 8.00pm daily. You have to walk around the cloud forest and ride the elevator to the top. We will go down after circling around each floor. There are different themes on each floor and its very good for taking photos. In fact, I saw a couple doing their pre-wedding photos there~
If you're not keen of walking a lot, I would not recommend this place. There is elevator available but in my opinion you cannot fully enjoy the beauty of this place if you don't walk around."
,,Amazing in a word,5.0,,In Short a must see. its truly AMAZING Along with marina bay and gardens by the bay this is a MUST VISIT and I mean a MUST VISIT
,,Amazing,5.0,,I have never seen a better botanical garden. Great concept and very well executed. Must must visit. Wow
,,like a movie scene,4.0,,"if they tried to recreate plants water in space ... this how i imagine it to be. nice place to visit, I suggest to go before dark and take another pass after it is dark.... with the lights it gives a different ambiance"
,,An absolute must see,5.0,,Our Cloud Tower experience was unforgettable. The whole place (with its giant glass dome) was fully accessible with lifts and walkways for people with mobility problems or using a wheelchair or scooter. The transport vehicle to get there also had a disability access part to take you to the conservatory. The view inside from the upper levels to see beautiful plants and outside sights was incredible. There was also a very good educational aspect explaining the way the environment works.
,,Cool! (literally),4.0,,A spot that should not be missed out! It was really cool. A very nice break from Singapore's heat. :)
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,Spent about an hour walking through the cloud forest. Have several beautiful flowers. Look for the hidden sculptures throughout the forest
,,Beautiful and interesting,5.0,,Just fantastic place to visit. Big artificial hill overgrown with tropical plants. You take lift to the top and slowly make your way down. Some of the paths are very high outside of the hill so if you really scared of heights I would not recommend it. It is very beautiful.
,,Part of Gardens by bay,5.0,,"In Short , this exemplifies Singapore commitment to be city in the forest ; wow this is 'vertical man made Bali ' ."
,,Not Your Typical Plants,5.0,,"I've never seen anything like this. The Cloud Forest is 7 stories high all of which have interactive and informative pieces, most of them with a focus on climate change. You can walk all around and inside of this majestic 'creature'. Definitely the best attraction in Gardens by the Bay, the Flower Dome does not even compare."
,,Love the waterfall!,5.0,,"We reached the place in the afternoon and there were not many people around. Some more, it helps that we bought the tickets in advance so it's pretty straight forward getting in to Cloud Forest. Best of all, we did enjoyed taking photos of the waterfall which is just amazing and beautiful to look at."
,,Absolutely brilliant,5.0,,"This is a must see place , a lovely experience. Beautiful water falls and do not miss out the mist hours , its every alternate hour. It can get pretty cool inside , so prepare accordingly"
,,Amazing design.,5.0,,We weren't quite sure what we were going to see in here but it was great. The waterfall at the entry immediately cools you down but it can be tricky to negotiate a path through all the photographers. The lost world at the top is amazing and offers great views of Singapore. The boardwalk through the cloud forest is very high and a little scary but worth the walk. Other lower Boardwalks are easier on the nerves. Some very thought provoking audio visual displays as you work your way down the mountain. Beautiful plant displays all through the whole dome.
,,Cool and peaceful way to spend the afternoon,5.0,,"The cloud dome is a very pleasant way to spend the afternoon. The orchids are stunning, as are the unique sculptures. You start at the bottom of the waterfall and make your way to the top, seeing how the vegetation changes, the higher you go. Its also delightfully cool inside the dome, which is a welcome relief. This is well worth a visit."
,,Fabulous - could spend hours there!,5.0,,"This was a fabulous display and well worth spending a few hours there. My only criticism was the display of stalactites and stalagmites that had been 'bought from other countries' - in other words, hacked out of caves in a case of what can only be described as environmental vandalism."
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited the Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest in June 2016. It is a beautiful place with waterfalls, greenhouses, a walking path that goes up very high. It is really an unusual place and very worth visiting."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Must see in Singapore, super nicely done. Beautiful nature! Do take a jumper though as it gets pretty cold inside!"
,,Singapore Cloud Forest,4.0,,"On a sunny afternoon a few days before Christmas and preparing for the overnight flight to Sydney, what better place to visit that the Cloud Forest in the Gardens by the Bay.
Under a hugh glass canopy, you immerse yourself into forests of the world, stunning waterfalls, vibrant flowers, lush fauna and amazing sky walks.
Simply stunning"
,,A must go place !,5.0,,"Before I bought the ticket, i thought it would be just a normal 'garden' but after I entered the dome I really love how they arrange the pathwalk and those trees. I like it better than the flower dome though. Worth the money !"
,,This place is amazing,5.0,,"It's hard to effectively describe this exhibit. To summarize, it is a ""plant mountain"" that simulates a cloud forest. The thing is huge, and it's housed in a giant glass terrarium. I was thoroughly amazed."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Was so impressed by the sheer beauty of this place. Incredible plants, futuristic architectural design and just gorgeous to look at from every angle. If you love plants, you will love this place!"
,,"""A must see and do in Singapore""",5.0,,"We had no real idea of what to expect... But our expectations were surpassed. this is a stunning piece of work and there is something here for everyone to enjoy, not simply gardeners. The architecture and the climate control of plants is amazing as is the size and spectacle of the dome- unique."
,,"except the waterfall, others are good.",3.0,,The waterfall looks awful because water is let down thru a pipe that is so visible. It looks like letting out the rain water from a terrace. The could have hidden the pipes and made to look natural.

It's really cool to be in there, literally the temperature. They got so many rain forest plants and they made the dome feels like a real one like in Sumatera. When you come inside, the magnificient Waterfall awaits for you. It's a huge place so make sure you have good energy to explore. There's a very long bridge that will take you to feel the whole side of this artificial rain forest. It's a must to visit when you're in Singapore."
,,Forest in Gardens by the bay,5.0,,beautiful place and a must see. It is an attraction that cannot be missed. To wonder how such a beautiful natural scene was created inside a dome is wonderful.
,,Garden in the sky,4.0,,Not many gardens are vertical and airconditioned but this one is. A nice way to spend your afternoon strolling around this very unique garden although it is somewhat expensive as it is a relatively small attraction that can be seen in half an hour at a leisurely pace.
,,mini nature park,5.0,,"nice to visit, as they have not only common trees, but as well as rare flowers, etc, they have several level with different theme, just before the exit we can watch short movie about what will happen and what to do for our world."
,,"OOOHHH, INCREDIBLE!!!",5.0,,This is truly amazing and not to be missed! We went after the night light show so we didn't have much time before closing-definitely not long enough but it's worth it no matter how long you can spare!
,,Walk Among the Clouds,4.0,,"It is a refreshing walk, away from the heat. To also take the lift up to the top of the structure for a great view of the Cloud Forest."
,,Simple Get-away from the bustling city,5.0,,Sometimes taking a walk brings you away from hustling of life A stroll here does the therapy that one needs to reset from the pace of hurriedness
,,Good Experience For a Local,4.0,,Got the package pass for Gardens by the Bay. The cloud forest was certainly a visually beautiful experience for us. Flora and the waterfalls complimented the cool atmosphere. Would recommend to go in the morning or evening.
,,Great engineering feat as well as inspiration for all gardeners.,4.0,,This attraction is easy to gain access to and delivers a fantastic experience of tropical gardens. We only went to one dome but you can get a discount for going into both domes.
,,Amazing Forest - Not to be missed,5.0,,"A visit to the Cloud Forest is a must when visiting Singapore, its a nice thought to have something within your reach.....very a refreshing feeling when you visit the place....The kids can learn loads with the information available at the location on the impact the humans are having on Mother Earth."
,,"Brilliant, cold and amazing",5.0,,"For a man-made mountain, waterfall and high-altitude climate in a dome in hot and humid, mountain-free Singapore, this is stunning. A wonderful experience, great views, interesting educational moments, and fabulous photos to be taken. Any visitor to Singapore I send to Gardens by the Bay. They doubt, then they rave."
,,Mesmerising!,5.0,,Truly mesmerizing to see this man-made 'forest-feel' built in the heart of Singapore. Very nice to place to visit with family. Kids will enjoy much!

Best representation os true nature I've ever been.
Ground floor ""Earth Check"" high level information of gas emissions and threatens to our planet streaming live"
,,Great attraction on a really hot and humid day!,5.0,,"Great time to spend with friends or family when it's super hot outside. The waterfall is spectacular all by itself and walking through and around the Cloud forest was quite fun and educational. Do check with your hotel front desk, some hotel can recommend you tourist attraction app/websites where you can purchase tickets on a discount for tourists. On Gardens' official website, their discounts are usually offered to local residents only."
,,Forest walk!,5.0,,The waterfall is man-made but looks stunning! Plus the ''glass canopy'' walk from the top. It was a great photo-stop during the hot afternoon!
,,Worth the Admission Price,5.0,,Very nice attraction in the Gardens by the Bay - scenic and also educational. Worth buying the admission when visiting the gardens.
,,Awesome! A must visit!,5.0,,"As soon as you step inside you will be impressed. There is a forty metre plus waterfall and vertical gardens that seem to reach to the sky. This is an amazing feat of architecture and horticulture. You walk up and up until you eventually take a lift to one level before the top of the dome and then walk up to the top before descending along a metal walkway that affords you views out and down that will take your breathe away. It's very safe but if you suffer from vertigo this might not be for you. Even if you aren't a plant person you cannot fail to be impressed by this place. It is a tropical paradise, which also has some lovely sculptures interwoven into the Botanical stories. The temperature inside is very pleasant. As you exit you will go through a theatre that explains the extrapolated affect of global warming on life on earth from now until 2060, if nothing is done to limit/countermand it. Worth watching even if you are a sceptic."
,,Very cool,5.0,,"Literally a cloud forest in a dome. It was a refresHung break from the heat, and it was totally interesting. Lots of walking."
,,Amazing indoor waterfall,5.0,,Nice indoor waterfall. Cool indoor temperature. Great artificial forest view surrounded by diverse and hidden floral gems. Admission is quite pricey. Worth a visit but not to say very amazing.

,,Escape the heat to the mountainside,4.0,,"The cloud dome really makes you feel like you are in the mountains ... including the chill so bring a jumper !

Greeted by the waterfall the dome and its plants are absolutely stunning.

Can be crowded which is annoying on the canopy walk so try and get in early to beat the crowds.

Very athestically pleasing and enjoying day out"
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,You can use the escalators and lifts but you dont see the different variations of plants/trees . There is a platform whuch you can walk back down on . Lovely photos can be taken . Been set out very well with some terrific views of Singapore . We saw otters in the lake playing around .
,,Clever Design with green water and cloud,4.0,,"Really we impressed when we just enter you will first see very big fall with little water touching your face then you will start your journey going up by elevator then start discovering and see the beauty with clouds and light with many kinds of plants going down in circle motion and in each corner you will have many many photo

,,Awesome,5.0,,One of the best thing of Singapore city. Breathtaking men made cloud forest with beautiful falls. An awesome place to visit. Must visit.
,,Nice experience,5.0,,This is part of the gardens on the Bay area. There are lots of plants and waterfalls and good explanations of how forests behave
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A remarkable piece of architecture and a wonderful experience. Inside the dome is a large artificial mountain with several large waterfalls coming down it.

As you leave there is an enlightening display on climate change."
,,Absolutely a Must See!!,5.0,,This was a real highlight of our Singapore visit! It is an amazing tour of wonderful plants and flowers.
,,Do not miss this !,5.0,,Amazing !! We had a great day out at Marina Bay and this was one of the highlights - do not miss this.
,,Very pretty,4.0,,This area is beautifully planted and the waterfall stunning. It's difficult to navigate with a wheelchair as there are steps and ramps. There us a lift.
,,Beautiful waterfall but nothing else,4.0,,Beautiful waterfall that is well worth the entry fee. But didn't really benefit from going all the way to the top of the waterfall.
,,Cloud Forest @ Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,Wonderfuly conservatory @ Gardens by the Bay. Suitable for all ages to visit at a very affordable low fee.
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,My wife and myself went for a visit here on a recent holiday in Singapore and I have to say it was well worth the money we thoroughly enjoyed the Cloud forest we spent a couple of hours here just wandering around at our own pace.
,,Beautiful presentation of tropical plants under air conditioned dome,5.0,,"You get to experience a walk through the tiered tropical forests in the air conditioned dome. If you look outside, you may see part of Marina Bay Sands modern building in the background, a good contrast against the natural green tower inside. I think there was an educational presentation segment where they show all the facts about pollution mankind is creating and how we must be aware of preserving our environment, etc. Good for kids maybe."
,,Customer Service needs to be better,3.0,,"I had always wanted to visit this attraction and was surprised that it was just average based on all the hype from some visitors I know. It has a spark I guess when there is some sort of flower show on. If you are interested in botany, then maybe this is the place for you tough you may have had a better experience elsewhere. It would be a choice if I did not really have anything else better to do that day or if it was raining outdoors.

Customer service can be much better. Staff needs more training in being cheerful, helpful and more energetic when up front with patrons."
,,Naturally Beautiful,5.0,,"Its cold & Worth visiting. I have seen all these tropical plants but the set up in Cloud Forest is awesome. the falls itself is captivating and realistic.
What I really like about is their +5 science shortfilm, its an eye opener to all to take care our forest all over the world."
,,Most naturally created artificial place.,4.0,,"Most naturally created artificial places tropical or subtropical, evergreen, moist forest characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level cloud cover."
,,Bring Your sweaters with You!,4.0,,"You have to see something like this once in a lifetime. It is basically a giant Rock which You can walk around from top to bottom and shows You the different flora/faune at the different sea levels. It is very cold inside especially in the entry level, so make sure You have Your sweater or hoody with You otherwise say hello to pneumonia!"
,,A waterfall inside the dome,5.0,,"One of my favorite place to visit. Easy to get there, affordable price, it worth. Cheaper entry ticket from agency."
,,Man-made marvel,5.0,,"This is a Noah's arc, but for plants and vegetation. It's an awesome piece of work that documents the vegetation at various heights in Nature. Take an elevator up and enjoy your journey down the ramp admiring the wonderful creation.

PS...There is a waterfall at the entrance, and it makes for an amazing backdrop for photographs"
,,excellent exhibition,4.0,,"The cloud forest is an excellent exhibition of vegetation occurring at different heights. Very cool, but with a nice waterfall and good explanations. Take time to wander the walkways - though not for people afraid of heights! Nice views also towards the big trees in garden by the bay and marina bay sands!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"We entered the Cloud Dome right on 2pm when they did the misting (every two hours). It was 34C outside and temperature inside was bout 10 degrees cooler. What a spectacular place. The range of plants is amazing and as an Orchid lover, I was in heaven."

,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Must visit in Singapore .. you will be in love when u watch this.. This water fall , the flowers at top floor everything is perfect."
,,Go late evening just as the sun is setting its amazing,5.0,,"Bought a ticket, which was 12 dollars, and started our visit later in the evening. It wasn't busy so the walk at the higher levels was relatively clear and we could take our time. In the late evening you get to see the lights of the city which is an added extra.

The actual venue is good value for money and well worth a visit."
,,Must see,4.0,,Stunning tropical gardens with huge waterfall all in an enormous glass dome/bubble. Guaranteed that you will say wow. Apart from the 5 levels inside there is much to do and see inside the Marina Bays gardens which will fill up a day.
,,Interesting place if you are interested in the gardens and rain forrest.,4.0,,"The indoor waterfall is very nice, and the setup of travelling to the top and walking down is quite interesting. The garden is nice, although a bit repetitive."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A garden of Edan under a roof with an amazing sky walk way . I don't do heights but this is just great, yes it moved a little but so much to see you don't notice it. Beautiful water fall and loads of sub tropical plants.
The building its self is quite fascinating and make time to do it all.
Can be wet in places and don't wear high heels ."
,,Worth seeing in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing architecture and beautiful sight! Absolutely worth seeing in Singapore. Temperature is nice and cool!
,,Holiday,4.0,,Like everything in Singapore they do it so well. Really enjoyed and if you are a tourist you should see. Also good break from the humidity. Will take the kids when we take them next year.
,,Amazing Design Transports You,5.0,,What a nice afternoon we spent walking around this place for two hours. It looks just as cool in the daytime and the nighttime. The Christmas decor is over the top wild and so is the light show. There are flowers fro floor to ceiling and cool platforms winding their way up tp the 7th floor. Great view of the Marina. Orchids all around. Ferris Wheel in the distance.
,,Nature inside,5.0,,"Very nice , very good garden well maintained , very clean , educative, great access lastly Air conditioned ..... Impresive indoor waterfall"

,,Day and Night - Don't Miss It,4.0,,"If you can organise your visit, make sure you get there before sunset and stay for the lights to come on. This is an amazing walk through a very well thought out and developed slice through a mountain rain forest that is compact and well laid out. Do not miss this one."
,,Something to do on a rainy day,3.0,,It's a cool indoor waterfall & you get to see some pretty great flora & fauna. Cool walkway up to the top.
,,a different kind of forest,5.0,,"VISIT DURING DAYLIGHT. The cloud forest is amazing for your eyes and for pictures. Especially the latter, you need to go there where there is still light. We went there during the night its amazing in the dark but i think it would have been great when we where there during daylight.

WALK the HEIGHT. You have to take an elevator up and then walk down from there. The view is amazing but those who have a fear of heights then this will be a challenge."
,,Well worth the entrance fee to enjoy the cool!,5.0,,Although you have to pay for the two conservatories; cloud forest and flower dome they are delightful. Air conditioned which helps the enjoyment!
,,amazing manmade falls,5.0,,"I'm enthralled by the waterfalls upon entering the dome, lush vegetation complemented the flowing water and cold atmosphere. One of the best things to see in gardens by the bay."
,,A must see,5.0,,Photo opportunities galore. Nice and cool and you can stand under the waterfall to really cool off if you wish. In my opinion it was the better dome to visit.
,,Impressive displays,5.0,,"Great displays of how the rainforest works .and the different levels of where the forests are found . sadly an "" EDUCATIONAL"" film display is straight out of Al Gores "" inconvenient truth""and making claims about global warming that have already been proven to be FALSE . pure propaganda for brainwashing children . if what they claim in the movie were true the gardens would already be underwater ."
,,An amazing exhibit of the marvels of nature in the centre of the city,5.0,,Once you enter the dome you are met by a giant waterfall that is the prelude to an exploration of the vegetal life of the world.
,,A much cooler alternative to the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Very impressive indoor botanic gardens with waterfalls and elevated catwalks to view them as well as the plants. A nice walk from Marina Bay Sands past the artificial ""trees"" and a great respite from the heat and humidity."
,,Must see,5.0,,This enclosed forest is such fun. Has a huge waterfall. Every plant I have ever known can be enjoyed as you walk round this forest. Because it is enclosed it is a great place to enjoy during the heat of the day.
,,A world within a world,5.0,,"Don't miss this. Mist, orchids, and a waterfall, your own little mountain forest - it's so unique it feels magical."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The Could forest is part two of the Gardens by the Bay exhibit. It is an amazing display, every step has something new to see and photograph. The whole display is amazing a must do when in Singapore!

One Negative is the destruction to Krast areas, the removal of formations is a really unfortunate and disappointing aspect of this display."
,,cool cloud forrest,5.0,,"I visited the cloud forrest early evening and enjoyed its cooling atmosphere after a long humid walk around the gardens in the area to take some photos with the first glow of the evening illumination.
On entering the cloud forrest it transports you into a tranquil zone with the sound of cool cascading waterfalls,and softly lit walls of exotic flora and woven paths taking you to the climax of the treetop walk.
A must for young and old."
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"If you love nature and are excited by seeing the colorful flora and fauna it has to offer, then visit this place. Every inch you can see a diverse plant on this man made wonder. Do not miss the Gardens by the Bay projected guide at the exit. That's an amazin g representation."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"Ocbc bank has promotion!yay!My friend and i spent good time there,the temperature is excellent ,the florists are nice but it is small,within an hour and we finished our visit."
,,Cool,5.0,,So peaceful environment. you will completely forgot your worries.i just want time to stop there . beautiful and breathtaking
,,Great experience at a height...,5.0,,"One of the major attractions at Gardens by the Bay. If you miss this, you ll miss it all.
Once you enter inside the dome, you are in a totally new space.
The architecture of the main buildings is incredible in their own way but what is inside is simply breathtaking. It felt like it went on forever. Unusual flowers to look at, a man made water fall. It isnt hot inside, pretty cool with the air conditioning going so take a jumper or something to slip over your shoulders. Do carry some jacket or a shawl along. Specially for kids its pretty cold inside.
It also has mist shows at various timings. If you are inside do see that...that a breathtaking experience...and do walk on the skywalks....just amazing....
try to go on a wkday."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Great way to stay cool on a hot, humid day. This was our favorite attraction, with the Zoo a close second."

,,Great if your not scared of heights,4.0,,"beautiful plants and an impressive indoor waterfall and when you consider the effort made to keep the tempature it becomes an even more impressive feat of engineering. I didn't experience the high level walk because I felt the fear bite once i got up to the top level, however, it looked a great experience for those intrepid people! :)
Good way to spend a few hours and see more of the Bay."
,,Great.,5.0,,This is a must see. Amazing displays of flowers. Waterfall is awesome. Lots of areas to rest as you go thru.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"Part and parcel with Gardens by the Bay. You can't visit the gardens without seeing Cloud Forest. It's like stepping into another world, almost fairytale like.
You step through the door into another climate in the middle of Singapore with an amazing waterfall spraying mist on you.
Again, the flowers and greenery are brilliant.
I fell in love with this place!"
,,Great experience,4.0,,Inside a magnificent greenhouse . A lift take you 7 floor up and you then walk down a swirling track taking you inside and out of this huge planted mount . Superb combo with the flower dome .
,,Surreal,5.0,,"Absolutely surreal! Amazing view, especially if you go at night. You'll get a great view of Marina Bay Sands and the suounding area"
,,Just Like a Real Forest,5.0,,We visited both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest on the same day and were not disappointed. The high waterfall right at the entrance is stunning and beautiful. We followed the path to see a variety of plants and flowers at various layers and sections inside the enclosed structure. The beautiful and futuristic structure of the winding walkway itself is worth visiting.
,,Magnificent!!,5.0,,"A must see if you are in Singapore
Took my family there today.
Wow!!!
It is truely amazing in every way.
The architecture of the main buildings is incredible in their own right but what is inside is simply breathtaking
We totally loved I'd.
It cost us a total of $40 for these two domes plus the Christmas lights and the tree house walks.
Must see"
,,This is THE dome to visit,5.0,,"WOW! DO yourself a favour go at night and see the lights. This is by far the best part of the gardens, a must see in Singapore."
,,Three day visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing place to see. I felt like I was filed with some energy when I was inside, for me personally great and different experience. Congratulation to who ever is behind this masterpiece."
,,Lush and outerworldly beautiful,5.0,,"A very almost unreal experience, starting with this waterfall right in the heart of the city, the mists, the lush foliage, the beautiful flora. Nice way to cool off and many great spots for nat-geo worthy photos. the sky bridge may be a little gut wrenching but just look straight? gorgeous place, truly an engineering wonder."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"The cloud forest is quite impress and definitely worth a visit. The waterfall and plants are gorgeous. This dome was significantly more interesting to us than the next door flower dome. The admission is a bit steep, but worth the price to see once."
,,Omg,5.0,,"I must say Singapore do there attraction so well. The waterfall as you walk in, is so cool. Great plants. And some really good viewing platforms. This is great for everyone."
,,"Great attraction, must see!",4.0,,"Cloud forest is really worth visiting, perhaps more than the flower dome if I had to choose (although we did both). It's really cold inside so come prepared with a warm jacket. Gorgeous waterfall and flowers and views from cloudforest. Highly recommend.

Visited in Jan 2015 during our honeymoon but cannot change the year."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"I lived in Singapore for a year but never felt the price was justified considering Gardens by the Bay is itself so beautiful and is free. I was wrong.
After returning to S'pore on holiday we decided it was finally time to pay the fee and see what we had been missing. What an experience. The Cloud Forest is both informative and awe inspiring. You learn a lot about the rare cloud forest environment while traversing the thrilling 'round the mountain' path. There are so many beautiful plants and flowers on the spectacular mountain and also some cool woodcraft here and there. It certainly offers a photo opportunity or two.
The hard-hitting climate change video post-walk really hits home after a few hours surrounded by one of natures most diverse, yet fragile creations. A great experience!

Ps. Afterwards we went to the Flower Garden, which by comparison didn't leave us very impressed. It's lovely but not the one of a kind marvel that the Cloud Forest is. I would suggest perhaps going to the Flower Garden first so you can steadily build your excitement and end with a bang."
,,"Futuristic, fantastic and very beautiful",5.0,,This part was my favourite of all Sky gardens! They feature amazing variety of plants here and they way they feature them is absolutely amazing! The architecture is great and everything was very thought through. I felt like I was in sci fi movie ;)
,,You have to see this!,5.0,,In the same area as Gardens by the Bay you will find this fantastic place. You just have to visit - Enjoy !
,,Highlight of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Spectacular and quite amazing! When you enter you are confronted by the most amazing waterfall. Take the lift to the top, and walk though the cloud forest canopy, gradually descending through the layers. A wonderful experience."
,,Nice but not amazing,3.0,,"Better than the next door gardens, but all in all not a must see and not amazing unless you are particularly into exotic plants that grow at height. We went because we thought it would be better."
,,Very pretty snd informative,5.0,,"Definitely worth visiting if you are in Singapore, you can book on line to save the queues, take refreshments as quite a lot of walking is needed. Good access for people using wheelchairs or limited mobility."
,,Too expensive!,3.0,,A piece of nature copied under glass! I think singapore has a lot of more to offer without being so expensive! A little bit disappointed!
,,breathtaking,5.0,,"i cant tell how beautiful its been or what its look like , its what u should see it by yourself the entry fee is 16 sgd and its really worth it there are many species of plants in there that u have never seen them and it has the longest indoor waterfall in the world which makes it unique"
,,Great Attraction,5.0,,"Located in Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest is a nice, albeit rather high priced, attraction. The A/C is most certainly welcome. The views are wonderful. The exhibits as you wend your way down from the top are quite nice. Along with the Flower Dome, the Cloud Garden is a nice way to spend some time in Singapore."
,,Mountain escape within the city,5.0,,"Walking through and seeing a huge waterfall and flora of the high mountains, this dome was better than the flower dome. Also got to walk up at the top on walkways looking down from the ""mountain"". Describes a little about mountain formation and the flora present at different altitudes.

There's also a display at the end about global warming which is worth watching. Overall spent around an hour in here and I would highly recommend if in Gardens by the Bay."
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,This is one of the attraction situated in the Gardens by the Bay. It is an artificially created Highest Water fall.
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"We had never seen anything like this before! It was breath taking for sure!! Every inch of this marvel was a wonder to behold! An indoor mountain of the most spectacular and beautiful plants and shrubbery and flowers of all kinds. It was the most unique of any mountain garden we have seen and appropriately called Cloud Forest. And enclosed like a botanical garden, but more massive than anything we had ever seen! On a scale that is unmatched, at least that we have ever seen before! You will not be disappointed..... be sure to put this on your list of things to see while in beautiful Singapore. ."
,,Unique,5.0,,"I have never seen anything like it , the experience was amazing. All the different levels and walkways . It's 7 floors up..don't worry there are lifts. I think it's best to walk around the bottom then go right up to the top on the lift and slowly walk the walkways and levels back down. It can be 30 degrees outside but in the cloud it's pretty chilly so pleased I packed a cardigan."
,,Amazing Mountain Oasis - must see attraction,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest dome, located on the banks of the Singapore River, is part of the Gardens by the Bay park but for me was one of the highlights of our visit to the park. It's open from 9am to 9pm and tickets are $28 for adults and $15 for children but that gets you into both the Cloud Forest dome and the Flower dome.
My impressions on walking into the Cloud Forest dome is that it's breathtaking- the first thing you see is the 42m (138ft) foliage covered mountain with a 35m waterfall cascading down its side. The cool mist laden breeze is refreshing after the humidity outside.
The ""Cloud Mountain"" is an intricate seven storey structure completely clad in orchids, ferns, mosses and all manner of greenery. You take a lift up to the top and gradually make your way down a series of ramps and walkways through the various levels. In between the greenery there are a variety of sculptures, which blend naturally with the surrounding vegetation. Starting at the 'Lost World' a pond at the summit of the Cloud Mountain you wind your way down to the 'Secret Garden' at the mountains base. My only disappointment was the 'Crystal Mountain Cave' which has a collection of stalactites and stalagmites cut from natural caves - too artificial, particularly if you've been inside a real cave system. The variety and colourful flowers and orchids is such a natural setting are truely worth seeing.
Don't forget to get a re-entry stamp when you're leaving, so that you can go back any time that day."
,,Lovely Falls,5.0,,the first thing that hits you when you enter the dome is the falls cascading from the top. we entered in the evening and the place was decorated with different colored lights. its was dazzling.
,,Distinctive place,4.0,,"A must-visit place in Singapore. The first time I thought it just a dome with flower and trees inside. However, it contains a whole mountain with waterfall. We can go up to the top and take some breathtaking pictures.
A decent place for family and children, natural lovers"
,,Pretty Special,5.0,,"You cant but admire the work, thought and inspiration gone into this attraction - absolutely stunning! Worth a visit."
,,Alot of the leaves are half dead. Too cold. Not beautiful,1.0,,"I am ashamed to have brought my relatives from overseas to visit the Cloud Forest. Alot of the leaves and some flowers along the pathways are either torn, yellowish, looks withered or half dead. There're limited signs to tell visitors names / information of the plants - so we have no clue what plants we are looking at. Not to mention the extreme coldness in the ""forest"". A totally unpleasant visit."
,,An amazing facility,5.0,,"This would have to be the most ambitious garden display I have ever seen. No expense has been spared to present a stunning display. We saw it late afternoon and night which was a good time, and stayed for the light show."
,,Massive inside,5.0,,"I was really shocked at how big it was inside. It felt like it went on forever.
Unusual flowers to look at, a man made water fall.
It isnt hot inside, pretty cool with the air conditioning going so take a jumper or something to slip over your shoulders."
,,a wonderful place to visit after the plants dome,5.0,,"This artificial fall with its galleries , beautiful plants and lush green trees .... everything is just wonderful..."
,,Wonderful spot.,5.0,,Lovely and well constructed indoor garden exhibit giving us a much-needed respite from Singapore's heat! We missed the misting session earlier though but could still see the aftereffects. It was a beautiful sight even in the evening and we wandered around for longer than we had planned. Would have been much better if foreigners were not so overcharged though.
,,Truly beautiful,5.0,,"A must do- exceptional architecture - the site is so beautiful beats any other ""gardens"" I have visited in a long time"
,,Impressive greenhouse with full size waterfall,5.0,,"What a spectacular way to engage visitors and teach them about the natural planet! The waterfall as you first walk in is directly in front of you and quite striking as a feature.

You take a lift to the top of the waterfall, and are guided back down via walkways and mini-exhibitions inside the waterfall. The walls of plants is very impressive, with a huge variety to look at, although there weren't many signs explaining what plants you were admiring.

The gift shop at the end was pretty good too. Definitely recommend a visit."
,,Amazing architecture and very informative,5.0,,I really like this place. I think this place is better than the Flower Dome. It has amazing architecture and man made waterfall. It's a cool place to visit on a hot day in Singapore. The theater also has information about global warming which is good to teach people to be aware of the global warming. I recommend this place to people who visit Singapore.
,,Respite from the Urban Jungle,5.0,,"Went there together with my daughter. The place was so beautiful that you feel like you really are in a forest. We immensely enjoyed the trip although we had to rush because it was closing time. Will definitely go back,"
,,Amazing array of plants and tree in spectacular environment,5.0,,"A giant conservatory featuring a 100-ft waterfall and central ""mountain"" that takes guests in and out of secret gardens via walkway called ""Cloud Walk,"" this is a great way to beat the heat.
The facility also has a theatre where they show a film called ""5 Degrees"" which takes the audience though the perils of global warming. Totally worth the cost of a ticket!"
,,Massive Glasshouse,5.0,,"Very impressive Multi-level forest located inside a Huge Glasshouse.
Take a lift up to the top insde this forest mountain.
Fully airconditioned - great on a hot Singapore day
Waterfalls all sorts of plant life worth setting aside 2 of 3 hours to enjoy the creativity displayed here"
,,Cool,4.0,,"Such a cool place I went here on summer and it was a really hot day. Pretty much cool here, but I think that there's not much to see since I'm not botanist"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,You should visit Gardens by the Bay in the evening since the colorful light shows are really beautiful. Since it was x-mas season the conservatory was amazingly decorated with x-mas lights and decorations. The indoor waterfall was so cool. The idea for the creation or this place is so modern and creative. Make sure to include this in your travel plan to Singapore. I promise you that you won't be disappointed.
,,Different every time,5.0,,"Go to the top first and then slowly walk down to see all the changing plants.Go down to the lower level to see the changing worlds presentation.Every visit you see something different.
Get a joint ticket with the flower dome.You can your hand stamped and return later the same day."
,,Cool Forest,3.0,,"Pretty Close to Cloud Forest, I would rather state its Cool Forest.
Everyone would accept its impossible to create what God has give us in nature. We are still trying our best and would say pretty close to it. Well maintained worth a Visit. Never Mind if it rain, its the place to be."
,,Always amazed what they can build in Singapore,4.0,,Great to bring visitors to or children. the walk ways through the clouds are great and you get some nice views of Singapore. Well worth a look and if you live local buy the membership. Also nice if you want to get out of the heat into a nice cool forect.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Defiantly worth a visit, spectacular plant varieties and species. The walk around the walkway is a must do. Whatch out for the misting times, nice and cool inside."
,,A standout in the gardens,5.0,,"The Bay Gardens have to be one of the modern wonders of the world. The Cloud Forest is fantastic. It is almost impossible to believe that there is the initiative and skill to built, provide and care for the variety of plants that are in this dome. The design of the water fall and misting of the plants in incredible. The walkway around the inside of the dome is a must do.

All of the Gardens by the Bay are more than first class. I would recommend a narrated journey on the ""train"" to get an idea of the various individual gardens with plants from many countries.

Then a walk across the elevated walkway between the large ""trees"" is a must and worth the small admission."
,,Must see,5.0,,"An amazing experience, so very well thought out and planned. Even if you are not a plant person this is worth a visit."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"An excellently laid out indoor garden with waterfall, sculptures and many many different varieties of flowers and plants. Following the well maid out route I started at the top and worked my way down. Lots to look at and you can view at your own pace"
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Lush and fragrant, the Cloud Forest takes you through several types of habitats. It's beautiful inside and you really find yourself immersed in the experience. Nice walk through. Not sure I'd go back for a 2nd time, but I really enjoyed going."
,,Nice dome,5.0,,Just within the Gardens by the Bay area. This dome offers the famous misting. The other two domes houses flowers and other things. It is not free so you need to buys tickets on the ticket booth or have an advance booking. But its worth the amount you will pay.
,,Interesting but not a must go for me,3.0,,"Definitely a place to go with kids. If you're a grown up, have traveled around and is alone or with friends.. there's nothing new to see.
The place is nothing more than some Flora from around the world.
Kids would definitely enjoy, because of the waterfall..
The architecture for me was the most amazing thing to see!"
,,Final day in Singapore,4.0,,We visited the cloud forest without knowing what was inside the dome. Really cool glad we visited but bring warm clothes as it's chilly inside!
,,Just amazing,5.0,,This would be the biggest glass house I have ever visited. It's ginormous and it's has a massive collection of flora and funa from across the globe. It is just superb - I know it's expensive to buy tickets to see both the domes but it's totally worth it. If you are a Singapore resident you can get concession too! So must see place
,,A Must see.,5.0,,We hadn't heard of the Cloud Forrest until we were visiting the gardens by the bay. I'm so glad we went and saw it. Nothing like anything I've seen before. A definite must see.
,,Spectacular displays from top to bottom,5.0,,"I love the way the path takes you on a tour around the outside of the forest but also at times through to experience the water falls from within. The displays of flowers, trees and art work are skilfully placed but generally close enough to take beautiful pictures and smell the delightful fragrances. Careful thought has been given to provide access and enjoyment for all."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful tall man made green structure which is a must visit . Bit cold inside but you can enjoy many hours inside
,,Amazingly beautiful,5.0,,One of the most beautiful places in Singapore. Very well maintained and has beautiful gardens/ flowers. The waterfall looks amazing. We took the elevator to go to the top and them came back via the walkway. Stopped at different places to soak in the beauty. AC inside is a respite from the Singapore heat outside :) It looked beautiful in the mist. Must-see if in Singapore!
,,Wonder,5.0,,Its a beautifully designed amazing piece of harmony between nature and man made structures. Its must see and probably a great answer for green hubs for all concrete jungles.
,,"Plants,waterfalls and views",5.0,,"Very nice place to experience flowers, plants and a really nice man-made waterfall. Get up high on the catwalks and view the display from different angles ...really nice way to spend an hour or so ..."
,,Fun to visit,5.0,,"This is the part of Gardens by the Bay where you have to pay to enter. The cloud forest was pretty spectacular. Yes, it's man made, but quite a feat of engineering. The six story waterfall is amazing. It's covered in plants and really something to see. Look around and you will see large beautifully carved wooden figures hiding in the plants. The dragons were my favorites but there were many animals too. The sky walks were very cool. Enjoyable for all ages."
,,what a pleasant surprise!,5.0,,We were positively surprised by the amazing cloud forest dome. After visiting some of the nature places shown in there we can definitely say it is very well presented. We actually spent much more time than planned
,,Cold as mountains,4.0,,The place is spread in levels and educate on global warming. They have various kinds of plants and flowers on display. The place is extremely cold for me. Its a beauty.
,,More than a unique experience,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest features a central 35 metre tall mountain which is covered in a huge diversity of rainforest plants which includes orchids, ferns, pitcher plants and epiphytes.

The central waterfall is the world’s tallest and provides an eerie veil of mist which envelopes the surrounding vegetation and provides the ambiance of actually being in a tropical mountainous location.

Take the elevator up to the top, then meander down the walkway which winds its way back down providing stunning aerial views of the canopy and the mountainside below.

The photographic opportunities are endless."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"This is an amazing experience. After the heat of the day, the Cloud Forest feels quite chilly. Water falls from a height, creating a cool breeze and a dynamic feel to the air. You can take a lift to the top of the tower then walk down using the walkways. These are very secure and create no feeling of vertigo, no sinking feeling in the stomach. You look down on everything, then as you walk down you pass trees and shrubs and ferns and flowers. It is a unique experience. It is only one part of the Gardens by the Bay experience, and well worth the entrance fee."
,,Fantastic Experience,5.0,,"If you have to decide between the two domes - choose the cloud forest. It is great, even if you are not interested in plants - it is magical! It's like walking in a magical garden. absolutely worth a visit!"
,,An Expereince Not To Be Missed,5.0,,Entering a different world you will be surprised by the waterfall and magnitude of the building. There is much walking to do to get the best from the experience but it is well worth it. it is a must see place
,,A must see,5.0,,"As part of the gardens by the bay this is by far the best dome of the two (other is flower dome...also worth a visit but not as breathtaking).

Buy a ticket for both domes is cheaper and recommended.

Other than the dome being air conditioned and having a cool mist from the waterfall in some areas it is breathtaking.

Inside the central spire is pretty much a hidden building with elevator, escalators and exhibits including stalagmites and stalactites.

Take a slow walk through the winding paths and enjoy the plants."
,,Amazing..,5.0,,"Very well made, the waterfall was a sight to behold ! All areas easily accessible by senior citizens as well..."
,,Big waterfall,4.0,,"It's nice, the air is fresh, and the waterfall is big, i felt like in the real forest, that was my fisrt time visiting waterfall without long walk or climb"
,,Wonderful display,5.0,,"We just happened to be in the Cloud Forest when there was a thunderstorm. Wow - what an experience, as the water was cascading down the dome (roof). The display of plants was wonderful."
,,an absolutely wonderful place,5.0,,"a place where the temperature is controlled and the trees grow in abundance but yet fully controlled , complete with the water fall and moisture , rain forest trees and moss as well ."
,,Unique and interesting,5.0,,It's a lovely botanical garden; the set up is unique. But it's very cold in there. Make sure to dress warmly.
,,super like,5.0,,"nice place, i like the trees and plants it reminds me of jurrassic park, i like the bonsai coz im a plant lover"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,I love this place! It is very cold though. I love the flowers and I would recommend it for every age and you should visit Singapore and come here. But bring a jacket!
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This place was magical, I'm so glad we went! It's super cool inside, welcome relief from the humidity outside. Wouldn't recommend the Flowerdome also as, especially now, it's mainly concentrating on tacky Christmas decorations. The +5 degrees cinema was scarily educative and interesting."
,,Singapore highlight,5.0,,"Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely. A massive indoor rain forest with 7 story waterfall and all. So well curated, amazing plants everywhere. Really interesting concept. They have 'mist' evrey 2 hours (even hours) where the plants are essentially watered. Worth attending if you can time your visit accordingly."
,,Worthwhile,4.0,,"Beautiful flowers plants, waterfalls. I took so many pictures of flowers with each one being more beautiful than the next. We felt cost to enter was inexpensive considering what you got to see."
,,"Good, but other nearby attractions are better",4.0,,"I bought tickets for the majority of the attractions in the Gardens By The Bay and this one was probably the least impressive, but nonetheless pretty cool. The catwalks up the ""forest"" make for great views and pictures. However, aside from the structure itself, I thought the displays and such within it were a bit gimmicky. If short on time, go to the other attractions such as the indoor botanical gardens instead.

I went during the day. Maybe this is better at night?"
,,Great at night in the dark,4.0,,"We visited in the dark and it added something extra and eerie about it, with all the mist and sounds. Really lovely wander around the cool dome on a hot night."
,,Cloud forest fantasy,5.0,,The cloud forest was one of the highlight of our sight seeing in Singapore. The 8-storey indoor waterfall was very impressive upon entering the sci-fi like pod. HOT TIP: Take a jumper/sweater as it gets quite cold in the pod.
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,"The plants and flowers are pretty but the whole experience was underwhelming for me. The domes are enormous and the space is not well-used. I walked through and thoughts ""so what"". They are definitely kept up well and the foliage is diverse and pretty. Wouldn't recommend it."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Cloud forest was enjoyable as you are walk around and up tot he top, the waterfall at the front provided good photo and video opportunities."
,,never miss the mist,5.0,,"This place comes in one compound of supergrove, gardens by the bay so plan one full day for this visit....you can get a combi ticket for all the three attractions.....by choice to get to the gardens by the bay in the morning......then afternoon in cloud forest and evenings in super grove......k lets come to cloud forest......full of lush greens and falls......the chills will make you shiver.....during the mist timings.....the feel is awesome...as well the view.....if you are love pics....then dont miss the chance....."
,,Wow!!,5.0,,If this is the place opposite Marina Bay Hotel it's worth a visit. It's free to enter but you have to pay to go up the large tower. The price you pay depends on the drink you want when you get to the top!!
,,A walk in paradise,5.0,,"This in my opinion is definitely one of the attractions you should go and see when you are in Singapore, especially I you go to Gardens by the Bay. It is centered around a vertical garden waterfall. There is a walkway which weaves around and into the central vertical garden. There is also a video presentation on the environment and also misting which occurs at specific times in the attraction (possibly giving the attraction its name). The highlight is walking along the walkway whilst the misting is going on and passing very close to the waterfall. It feels like a walk in paradise. Standing by the waterfall is amazing, seeing and experiencing the fall from the top is truly magical."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing experience. Very unusual and some unexpected delights. To think that it has only been finished for 3 years is a wonderful feat. Not to be missed.
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,Must see great for kids you could spend hours here.Very beautiful place ro see.What they have made is just amazing.
,,Waterfalls and exotic plants with excellent sky walk (not for those with fear of height),5.0,,"I'll start by saying that as a non Singaporean, you have no choice but to buy a SD$28 ticket that allows you to visit both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome (Singaporeans can choose to buy tickets for one or other or both at a discounted price).

It is an excellent place to cool off and see native orchids and other non native plants in a 'bio-dome'. At various times of the day, the whole enclosed dome gets a short 'misting' of water which makes it quite a nice experience. It boasts the highest man-made waterfall in Singapore. As part of the experience you walk through the gardens and end up at the top of the structure via elevators and escalators where you can then walk along the outside of the waterfall (but still in the dome) on metal walkways. The walkway is very high up so if you have difficulties with height, you should be warned. You are not forced to go on this walkway (there are 2 levels, top level and mid level which is about tree top height) and there are still plenty of nice plants and flowers to see.

Enjoyed this and Flower Dome a lot more than I had imagined I would. Highly recommended."
,,Like Avatar,5.0,,"A garden of the future. Beautiful, loved the orchids, feels like I'm on another planet. Very creative, calming, relaxing. A memory to cherish forever."
,,Waste of Time!,1.0,,If you are short on time and want to explore more of Singapore. Dont waste your time here. Only Visit Gardens by the bay.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,The waterfall which you can go inside is the highlight. There are many varieties of plants from all over the world. Also in the basement area are examples of stalignites and staligmites which is very interesting. There are examples of exotic plants from Africa to Europe to South and North America and of course Asia and Australasia
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The variety of trees and regions represented is amazing. From Olive trees to Giant Cactus and African trees you can see everything. The sculptures made on wood, roots and grains are gorgeous and perfectly decorate the garden During specific times you can get some drizzle in the rain forest.
You can visit the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome on the same day. If you arrive by MRT it is a good idea to take the shuttle to the Forest as it is long walk and it is always a warm day."
,,Nothing much,3.0,,"Except for the cooling atmosphere, I would not advise the trip there as there's nothing much to see though."
,,Great afternoon,5.0,,"The cloud forest was beautiful, I'm not really a plant person but it was a wonderful afternoon, we managed to get out before the misting and the kids enjoyed learning, which is always a plus"
,,Reluctant flower viewer,5.0,,"After being dragged along, this is now one of my favourite spots.

Both glass structures are so different to each other and the sheer amount of horticultural surprises and depth of care and imagination is always a delight to see and experience. The surrounding gardens are also so well maintained and planned out and don't forget to get in some satay and other tasty items at the Satay Foodcourt (and a generous dollop of Aunty's ice cream for a dollar)."
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,Come armed with a jacket as this place was pretty called esp if you live in a hot country like me. Breathd Taking and gorgeous a sight.
,,man made water fall,4.0,,"it's one of the dome in garden by the bay, it has man made water fall and sky walk, one needs to use lift and reach at the top and then walk along the sky walk to come down, it was good experienec"
,,Garden by the bay,5.0,,The cloud forest is within the garden by the bay and is an entertaining place to visit. It is so well done and a positive must when in Singapore
,,"Combines imagination, flair, horiculture and technology.",5.0,,"These gardens are just amazing, have been to quite a few top gardens around the world, but love the flair and technology in these really amazing setups. I would allow at least half a day for each of the domes."
,,Surreal 😍😍😍,5.0,,The place is worth the money. I never thought that a nice and amazing waterfalls can be cold as this. The place is so clean and well maintained. The staffs are so friendly and accommodating.
,,Waterfalls,5.0,,Most amazing what a little lateral thinking can achieve. The point of never a problem always a solution. Truly amazing
,,Refreshing,5.0,,Takes you to a different world just as you enter with mist and beautiful falls greeting you . Made on multiple levels with lovely walking experience and incredible flora
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"Just like if you where in a clousd forest far away from here! It's magical, just magical as it shows us so much beauty. Defenetly worth the detour."
,,Stellar,5.0,,Loved it. Unfortunately we missed the misting that takes place every couple hours. It was highly recommended but we couldn't stay for it. Even without the misting the cloud forest is spectacular and is the highlight of our visit to the gardens. Not to be missed!!!
,,An amazing array of exotic plants,5.0,,An amazing array of exotic plants all showcased in magnificent displays. A must see attraction in Singapore.
,,Imagine the hobbits are somewhere around,5.0,,We combined this visit with the gardens by the bay. Bought a ticket for the cloud forest and also the flower garden both well worth seeing
,,wonderful experience,5.0,,I visited this place along with my wife. It is amazing how they have built it. It is indoors and fully airconditioned. A must for travellers
,,Highly recommend !,5.0,,"This forest is simply amazing! The indoor waterfall is definitely the highlight, but the Lego flowers are awesome too. The +5 degree show is very interesting and awakening. In short, a must-go place in Singapore."
,,Great waterfall setup,5.0,,"The waterfall setup and the +5 degree shows are really good. The mist happens at every even hours (i.e, mist is sprayed on the plants)."
,,A new experience,4.0,,This was a new experience for us. In India we see everything natural of whatever is there in cloud forest. Everything was artificial but was a different experience. Should really appreciate Singapore for creating them as they don't have it naturally. There is artificial waterfall and you can go up the building using elevators and start climbing down. While you climb down you see many ancient/history artifacts and presentations.
,,Must fo,5.0,,Completely unique and a must to...fit it into the plan and try go go on a sunny day as you can squeeze in the park also
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,The best part of Garden by the Bay. I am so glad I went. I like how it was divided into sections. I could have stayed there for hours looking at the unusual trees and flowers. The cloud walk is not really scary...just don't look down. But remember it is optional
,,"A cool escape from the heat, in a garden wonderland.",5.0,,"I could walk around this garden endlessly for hours. The catwalks allow you to make the most of it, but when you need something to get you away from the oppressive tropical heat, while still being able to walk around and enjoy a bit of a journey, this is the place for you.

Pack your camera. There's almost a limitless catalogue of beautiful sights to see. It isn't the cheapest attraction in Singapore, but it is well worth the visit."
,,Wonderful structure,4.0,,"I have never seen anything like this wonderful tall green structure which you can go inside, it is so tall and has waterfalls coming from the top"
,,Freezing and amaizing,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the cloud forest dome. After a longer stay in Singapure we liked the fresh cool air inside. The view was really great, but be prepared that after 1 hour its getting too cold, so at least take a poolover with you. And maybe a skarf too :)"
,,cool and chill- great,5.0,,Amazing experience. cool and chill six floors of amazing green. Admission fee: 16 sin dollar for tourist located in gardens by the bay - wounderful very recommended
,,Inspiring,5.0,,"Well worth the visit. Cool inside and much more than I was expecting. The plants are gorgeous, and the walk is easy."
,,Expensive for what it is.,3.0,,We visited in October 2016 and it definitely was not worth the $28 it cost to get in. If you are not fit do not go there because it involves lots of walking.
,,interestingly different to see in the evening,5.0,,"This is my 2nd trip to the Cloud Forest and it certainly has a different ambience in the evening. I think daylight hours are probably best as the blooms show up more, however, it is lovely walking about in subdued light and getting a bit damp with the waterfall. Highly recommended"
,,Do not miss,5.0,,"If you have not read anything about this place, like i did, you will be amazed at the sight of the waterfall under the dome. The care which has been taken to control the temperature inside the cloud forest is worth appreciating.
I could spend a whole day inside this dome, there is so much to see.
Make sure you carry a good camera, you will not be disappointed.
Must visit"
,,Great!,5.0,,I just loved this - so amazing what has been created here. Very interesting movie explaining what is happening to our earth re rain forests and what is happening to our water resources.
,,JUst Wow,5.0,,"It shows what planning and passion can do, this attraction will wow even those are not that into plants. Take the time it is worth it."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We went in here after sunset and it was fantastic. The water fall was terrific as were the flowers. Well worth a look
,,You need to visit if you're in Singapore,5.0,,"The better, in my opinion, of the 2 domes. Stunning waterfall and flora and fauna that really shows off the different types of climate in the dome. What I couldn't get over was the amount of tourists posing for photos all over the place."
,,Cloud forest is magical,5.0,,"This place far exceeded any pre conceived ideas I had about what I would see , from the moment I entered to the time I left I couldn't put my camera down for more than 20 meters , awesome flowers and walkways , sculptures where also great and topped off with a reality check about our planet in the form of a movie explaining 5 degrees of climate change."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Very well plan. Kids really enjoyed the Cloud Forest. the water falls is amazing . Difficult to express the fillings in words. Amazing Experience with family
,,Cloud forest - nice experience,5.0,,Cloud forest is a dome shape figure inside which you will find a big waterfall as you enter. It gives you a feeling of natural habitat and as you walk in the whole structure is maintained with lot of plants n flowers where one can walk or use elevator as per convenience. But the feeling is amazing to be inside a dome and experience nature.
,,Paradise under one roof,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was a wonderful surprise. As soon as you walk in to the impressive waterfall and feel the mist on your skin, you're immediately relaxed. The dome is impressive and a photographer's paradise. If you're looking for a get away for an hour and relax, this is an attraction that will meet these requirements."
,,Serenity in the middle of the city,4.0,,Very you enter you are treated to the site of a waterfall and the blast of cool air the permeates the dome. As you walk along the path you will see an incredible variety of plants and flowers and trees and some very interesting wooden sculptures.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,This was a highlight of our trip. Take something warm as it gets very cold in here. The cloud walk was incredible although I have vertigo and heights terrify me I did it. 35 metres high!
,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay Both Sky Garden n Cloud Forest with elderly parents,5.0,,"We were v happy to see our parents n their caregivers enjoying the beauty of the whole place. It was a bliss pushing them on wheelchairs. 3 of them on wheelchairs with 3 of us wheeling them around every corner. Taking pictures, selfies n videos. Though it's in the heart of the city we felt like we were in a foreign land. Beautiful must visit place for all ages."
,,avoid in the evening,3.0,,An impressive structure but lighting conditions are far from optimal and make it hard to enjoy the full spectrum in the evening.
,,cloud forest - gardens by the bay,5.0,,"we were there just prior to Christmas 2015, fantastic, beautiful decorations, every childs dream (and adults), well worth the visit."
,,"Cooling, relaxing, mystifying walk up a gently sloping pathway",5.0,,"Even as a local, the cloud forest can still dish out several surprises. Atmosphere being one of them. This place is generally cool - around 25 degrees celsius which is considered cooling for us locals. The walk is around a man-made knoll roughly 6-7 storeys high. But the path slowly curls around with a relatively gentle upward gradient, making it suitable for young and the young at heart.

I won't spoil the rest of the fun but there is a summit.

The definition of fun here is in the perspective of relaxation. It's a good place to relax your mind."
,,Great attraction in Singapore,4.0,,Make sure you take your guests its a great attraction in Singapore. Lots to be learnt and enjoyed. Spend some time wind your way to the top and back again. Enjoy
,,Amazing Man-made Marvel,5.0,,A must go-to place for locals as well as visitors. You will experience nature in an environment where the plants are supposed to live right in Singapore. The variety of plants itself is marvellous. The Cloud Forest structure itself is amazing.
,,Indoor eco system really 1 of a kind,4.0,,went with my wife and first thing you see is a man made waterfall which awes and setting what you expect will just blow you away.
,,One of my favorite places in SG,5.0,,I won't mind going back to this place over and over just to escape Singapore's humidity and feel revitalized.
,,Breathtaking beautiful,5.0,,The cloud forest hands down was my favorite part of the gardens and dare I say my favorite attraction in Singapore. The different levels of the cloud forest and the different climates tell a very interesting story about different environments. It's worth the visit. You will see beautiful landscapes and learn a few things about the environment and climate change.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Mists descend and fauna hangs from man made massive indoor waterfalls. You expect a dinosaur to appear from the foliage in places. Orchids and ferns wave in the moist air as you walk around this mega structure! Simply fantastic and a must see!
,,Cooling effect!,5.0,,"A very interesting visit, enjoyed the walk from the top down to the bottom. The man made waterfall gave a cooling effect around the surrounding area. Singapore always come out it with something new which is amazing!"
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,"This place is amazing, highly recommend and great value for money. It is also a great place to get out of the heat."
,,A unique part of Gardens by the Sea,5.0,,"For those who have not ever seen a real cloud forest, the Cloud forest with take you there. The moisture loving plants are all in perfect condition, The coolness of the bubble is a relief from the hot Singapore are. Visit it anytime of the day. Expect to see lots of people in this wonderful display."
,,never gets boring,5.0,,"like the flower dome, this was my 2nd visit (1st one being in October 2014) and i always go to the cloud forest after the flower dome. people afraid of heights might have a problem going up and walking on the metal bridge but if they face their fears, it will definitely be worth it"
,,Spectacular garden visit,5.0,,It was great to see the fantastic array of plants and the landscaping and engineering to make amazing attention. Well worth a visit.
,,Good place,5.0,,"Entrance fee of 18$ required , They have atmosphere control and is a unique thing seen in life ....."
,,Not just the scene but information.,5.0,,"At first they only showcase the plants and flowers, the Falls and the Crystal cave but in the end they will lead you to the +5 Degrees. This visual presentation gives us information on Climate change and its effect in the next years to come."
,,Night visit,5.0,,Beautiful however somethings hard to see at night.. Even though still beautiful would of loved to have seen it during the day too
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,It's unbelievable close to the tropical forest climate we experience in real forests. It's sustainable by the Gardens by The Bay park structure. Great break from the heat of Singapore.
,,Wow,5.0,,This was a wonderful experience because you don't just visit this dome you are immersed in it. From the over whelming waterfall as you enter to the sobering educational video as you leave this will stay with you long after you've left. Really worth seeing.
,,Planned to a T...,5.0,,"... as with the rest of Singapore, but nice nevertheless and well worth a visit to see what humans can achieve with what the good Lord has given us. It is always wonderful to see Mother Nature preserved."
,,"A must see for any plant lover, simply amazing",5.0,,"I you love you plants and gardens the cloud forest is a must see attraction whilst in Singapore, this combined with the other attraction at Gardens by the Bay is something everyone should experience. Spend some time and learn how this wonderful attraction really works and the incredible environmental practices the use to run the park as well, it will amaze!"
,,Really artificial,3.0,,"I didn't really like the cloud forest as it was really artificial, the best thing about it was escaping the heat for a little while. My tip is to skip the domes, walk around the outdoor gardens and catch the supergrove night show."
,,"I Hate paying for visit, this was worth it",5.0,,"As the title says, not in the happen of paying for visits, especially when you get there the queue to get it is LOOOOONNNGGGGG. however, it was worth it. the tickets cover two part this and the flower gardens. we didn't wait long in the line, it was moving fast, with the amount of people in the centres you would think it would be packed, but it was spacious inside with space for everyone, people with their selfie sticks would piss you off a lot more than the facilities, since the selfie sticks were destroying the flowers. anyways, apart from that it really was a pleasure, i would say go before it gets dark, we started with the flower and finished with the cloud forest. if you get chilly, you might want to bring a pullover/jumper. Enjoy the visit. :)"
,,Interesting for everyone and a good place to stay cool.,4.0,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay in the morning when it was already hot outside. Flower Dome was closed for maintenance so if you want to see both conservatories, check they are open before going. We were only charged for one conservatory. Cloud Forest is quite amazing to see, even if you are not particularly interested in plants. It's also air conditioned and a great place to cool off. We spent about an hour in total to visit each level and walk around the suspended paths casually. The bottom level contains a smaller ""Secret Garden"" which is landscaped and features interesting sculptures and hidden corners, as well as a brief mini theatre show about climate change. Kids of all ages would enjoy a visit to Cloud Forest, recommended length of visit: 1hr."
,,Must See,4.0,,"This is a good place to see, one of a kind with the educational lectures on keeping our role in helping mother earth."
,,Beautiful refuge from the heat,5.0,,"Definitely a must visit while in Singapore. Amazingly cool inside, with easy sloping ramps that wind up and around the waterfall. Allow at least an hour to walk through but could take up a lot longer if you like to read all the info along the way."
,,Best tourist thing to see in SIngapore,5.0,,"Given that most Singapore 'for-tourist' attractions are, well, a bit rubbish, this was a real surprise. A great walk up and through a rainforest dome. Some great plants to see, views of Singapore and some good art too. Must-see for Singapore for sure, and can combine with a walk through the Marina gardens."
,,Mesmerising!,5.0,,"I went to this place several times already, and each time, it was fun and mesmerising, making me feel as if I'm not in Singapore at all. The modern structure coupled with the range of exotic plants plus the mist and the waterfall - it feels like a mini adventure. My kids (10 and 4) both love going here!"
,,"beautiful, must visit",5.0,,"beautiful, must visit . . . Its absolutely astonishing and such huge variety of all kinds of flora and fauna. not an easy job maintaining the same. perfect for pictures and exploring all the greenery from across the world"
,,Amazing flowers and groves inside a huge building.,4.0,,"Orchid is the highlight of Cloud dome, there are hundreds of different types of Orchid. The plants and flowers are beautifully decorated and it an amazing experience to see the variety of plants and they they are displayed.

At the end the short film on Global warming makes effect in each one of us. Its a must visit attraction

Nearby we also have water park for children."
,,Nice visit,4.0,,We went there last night . Some places were lovely and some were really dark .Probably better to visit during the day . But some are better at night . So maybe do both its cheap to do
,,A variation on the Eden Project (UK),3.0,,"I got in ""free"" as I had a Singapore sights pass. I wouldnt have gone otherwise.

Its fine. For me the value is that it is semi-educational, but nothing beats a real rain forest. I hired an audio guide but it didnt work well, I got so irritated I took it back. Best bit is its nice and cool."
,,Excellent sop of the day,5.0,,"Strongly recommend this to any visitor. It is located at the Gardens by the Bay and is one of the 3 main attractions of the Gardens. Suggest you bring a light jacket, sweatshirt or a windbreaker, as it does get slightly chilly inside."
,,Great forest views,5.0,,Easily accessible by all giving a great experience of the forests. Plenty to see and experience and well worth the entrance fee.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"My partner and I did this one night we were e plotting around Singapore and it was so easy to get tickets and was absolutely amazing inside! This attraction is a must do, we weren't expecting to do this attraction on our trip but we are very glad we did and we would both do it again!"
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Highly recommended even if you are not a gardener. I was surprised that it was quite 'chilly' inside, I'd imagined due to there being lots of orchids and tropical flowers that the climate indoors would be warmer. Recommended."
,,"A mountain, inside a building. Simply Brilliant.",4.0,,"The Cloud Forest display is a very beautiful vegetative display that had some quirks in it. As a non-gardner I expected to be surrounded by gardening fanatics all talking Latin and excited by the reproductive bits of vegetables, so I was reluctant to go. It was a waste of a worry, as the display was fascinating, and even incorporated a display of carnivorous plants made out of Lego
Well worth the visit"
,,Great place to escape the heat,5.0,,Really remarkable place. Totally enjoyed wondering around the Cloud Dome. The flowers especially the orchids were beautiful. The sound of water is very relaxing.
,,Refreshing,3.0,,Nice view feels like you've walk into the forest. Educational too as teaches about the plants and its importance to climate change. Great for pictures
,,Must be experienced on any Singapore visit!,5.0,,A truly amazing experience- well designed and easy to negotiate. Amazing exterior structure and awesome elevated sky walk within. A real oasis on a warm and balmy Singapore day.
,,Impressive architecture design,4.0,,"Breathtaking indoor water fall blending with walls of tropical plants and flowers. It is a must-visit in Gardens By Bay, Sinegapore."
,,"A Fantastic Place, But Way Too Cold!",4.0,,"A fantastic detailed place, with many lovely Flowers, but it is freezing cold in there. I have visited many time with all family members, but it's just too cold. I know it needs to be cold for the Flowers, but they need to tone it down a bit. Excluding that, I would highly recommend it here!"
,,Magnificent real-life FFVIII Balamb Garden!,5.0,,"If you have ever played Final Fantasy VIII, you'd remember that the first place you'll be acquainted with is the serene Balamb Garden.

The Cloud Forest conservatory at Gardens by the Bay feels like a real-life versio of Balamb Garden sans the classroom and training grounds. The moment you enter its doors, you will feel like you have stepped into a fantasy world that satisfies all your wildest videogamer imagination.

The first thing that welcomes you is this majestic misty falls, which immediately creates a feeling of grandeur. Then, you will almost as instantly feel that the place is chilled to a colder-than-usual temperature. At times, particularly in the evening, those who are less than tolerant of the cold may need a sweater, but most other times, it's a refreshing coldness from the humidity of the outdoors.

I have always gone up to the Lost World first; and, then made my way down to all the other displays/exhibits. I just feel that that route is the most effective way to appreciate the garden and to fully enjoy a kind of Final Fantasy exploration experience in it.

There are so many beautiful orchids, which they manage to grow together in one place; and, at night, when all the lights are turned on, the top-most part of the garden even further appeals to my Final Fantasy perception of it, because it looks like the nose of the Ragnarok Spaceship making its way into the garden. It is also almost always misty inside, thus adding to the intriguing mystery that the place gives off.

Of course, you have to have some inherent appreciation for nature, to truly enjoy being here. Coupled with a healthy imagination; and, this place can be such a heaven in all its Final Fantasy-like glory!

It is perfectly tranquil for the soul-searching solo traveler; romantic for couples on a date; soothing for the stressed out busy-body; intriguing for the first-time tourist; and, exciting for kids with adventurous mindsets. It is educational too, as it offers lessons on global warming; and, conservation in one of the mid-level floors."
,,Good Amazing Setup and indoor waterfall,5.0,,"Very nicely created and well maintained Dome, that houses an indoor waterfall and an artificial Mountain, Theres an elevator to reach the top and houses plenty of natural stones and Greenery to stroll around. Good for taking pictures."
,,No such experience elsewhere,5.0,,"I would not say much but you first word out of you mouth would be a a big ""WOW!"". This place is megestic! Problably this is the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. Singapore has invested a lot for this place and it really worth visiting. There are two tiers of suspended walkway from which you can view the vegetation in cloud forest as well as the beautiful surrounding! Its heavenly experience!"
,,Spectacular!!!,5.0,,Don't miss this if you visit Singapore! This is truly a one of a kind place. Very special. You feel like you have been taken to another world! All I can say is wow! Unique ecosystem waterfall walkways that take you around the mountain. Breathtaking.
,,Step into a magical place,4.0,,"If you are a fan of parks and exotic flora, this place is a must-go. It keeps certain species of plants that naturally wouldn't be able to survive the perennial tropical weather of Singapore."
,,Dizzying view on those walkways!,5.0,,The huge waterfall upon entering the venue makes a strong impact. I loved the walkways that made me feel as if I'm riding a roller coaster. The video at the end will make you realize how a hotter earth impacts our lives.
,,Too artificial,2.0,,I feel like a walk in a crowded artificial forest. Everything is too artificially which I personally don`t prefer.
,,Top manmade attraction,5.0,,"In Singapore this attraction is one of the memorable one. You feel like a walk in a dense cloudy forest. Many varieties of plants, foggy atmosphere which is created artificially.
When you look from above you have feeling of looking from hill with fog all around.
Its must see attraction point in Singapore."
,,Mesmerizing view,5.0,,"You'll be greeted by a huge waterfall when you enter. Even if you're not into gardens, this is still a must-see as you can climb up to the 2 skyways to view the surrounding area. The cloud walk is very high, so take caution if you're afraid of heights."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,Nice cool place...They tried to create a tropical place inside a completely close environment. Probably the best place in the lot of Gardens by the Bay.
,,Stunning! You MUST visit the Cloud Dome,5.0,,"We spent one morning visiting the Cloud Dome, it was absolutely amazing! In our group there were various ages - children and adults, yet we all were totally mesmerised. The gorgeous plants, sculptures, gardens and the amazing Waterfall! Even non-garden lovers would love this. The views are spectacular from the top level."
,,Part Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This attraction featured waterfalls, misting and walkways at various levels, enabling the visitor to experience the plants and many wonderful sculptures from different perspectives. Wonderful photo opportunities, including exhibition of stalagmites in the ""cave"" area. A very welcome biome to enter when warm temperatures prevail outside."
,,"Good, but . . .",3.0,,". . . Expensive and a little overhyped. I was quite disappointed, but maybe my expectations were just different to the reality.

The information placed around the dome is very good and is provided in all four of Singapores languages. They also have audio guides for many more languages, making this a very accessible and multinational experience.

The vast collection of plants is astonishing and great care has been taken to habituate them in the dome and show them off to visitors. However, this for me was what was disappointing.

By 'cloud forest', I expected to walk into a contained environment where a habitat would be created by allowing plants and flowers to grow freely and with little to no human intervention, to mimic that of a natural cloud forest habitat. In this case, it is little more than a pretty garden with some good skywalks.

For this, I felt S$28 was expensive. But the staff were very pleasant.

I'd recommend bringing something warm to wear as it can be quite cool."
,,Lovely layout,5.0,,"you really do get to wind your way thru the clouds up to the top. Absolutely amazing, definetly the better of the two conservatories. skybridges are a must"
,,Indoor waterfall,5.0,,After visit flower doom..i visit cloud forest because 1 package. Firts door we see waterfall..we can take picture after that we just follow the stairs and road..but in upstairs there is brigde that you can enjoy singapore from may be 50 meter. Good view..and many spot for take picture
,,Perfect for Hot Day!,5.0,,Wonderful experience! The waterfall keeps everything cool inside. The cost to set this up must have been phenomenal. It also talks about global warming and the potential effect on cloud plants and animals. Well worth a visit.
,,Great views,5.0,,"Before we came to Singapore we had planned to visit this place and we were not disappoinred with what we saw.
Even though my wife hate heights, it was her idea to go here and we walked through the mists of the forest and under the waterfalls.
There are really good views across Singapore from the upper level"
,,Awesome place,5.0,,Dont miss this one. Its truly awesome. It is an enclosed dome with artificial mists to create a hill station environment. There are skywalks around the dome which is quite and different experience. Both adults and kids will enjoy it. Additionally it is such a relief from the humid hot climate outdoors. Plan to visit this during the hotter part of the day.
,,Loved it.,4.0,,Loved it. And loved the waterfall. The walk around going up is beautiful and one feels fresh and alive. For small kids do carry a light jacket or a thin wind sheeter.
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"Great experience at the Cloud Forest in Gardens By The Bay.

You can walk around the whole place within an hour and would recommend to go at sunset so you get to see the best of both with the beautiful waterfall during daytime and lit up at dusk.

you can buy a dual ticket for both cloud forest and flower dome although we preferred the Cloud Forest."
,,My favourite experience in Singapore,5.0,,A must see in Singapore. A well laid out attraction. Very comfortable and relaxing stroll. The place is very impressive in terms of diversity of flowers and size of the structure.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"cloud forest is giant glass house . It features a 35-metre-tall mountain covered in vegetation, shrouding the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. me and wife enjoyed the path way from lost world to bottom ."
,,Mysterious story to a different world!,5.0,,"Passing the checking gate, I was welcomed by a tall water fall originating from nowhere above. It seemed that I was in a different world. Step by step, the story about the multi-level forests was discovered. Walking on Sky was amazing from the top to the bottom. I could touch tree top and water fall.
Moreover, the attraction gave me an attention about the effect of earth warmth, which was brilliantly presented in ""+5 degree"" animation with a lot of evidences. Therefore, this attraction is also educational."
,,"Well arranged, and constructed space",5.0,,"Multi-story column in the center, you walk around the bottom, take an elevator to the top, then walk down around/through the column using walkways. Nice waterfall, different theme per level, and a garden made entirely out of lego :-)"
,,An unexpected surprise...,5.0,,"Although close to the center of Singapore, this series of indoor and outdoor gardens is amazing. A great place to spend 1-2 hours wondering through the gardens/spaces and discovering new plants, water features, etc. A great ""take a break"" destination."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Go for it. You will not be disappointed.Beautiful Artificial Waterfall. Very Cool and Refreshing. Nice View from the Top.
,,Incredible space,5.0,,We were blown away by the scale of this place and the stunning plants and walkways. Took so many photos. We preferred it to the flower garden as it was more natural and not so pristine
,,Must visit,5.0,,If you're already at Gardens by the Bay you have to visit the 2 indoor domes. Quite spectacular and an engineering feat
,,Engineering level 5000,5.0,,This part of the Gardens by the bay had me absolutely gob smacked. It is a marvel of human ingenuity with a some what of a natural touch. I highly recommend that you visit if your in the neighborhood as it is well worth the visit and staff here are vary friendly and helpful.
,,So pretty,5.0,,"This was better than I expected, so pretty and so many unexpected little features. I could not do the walkways as I am scared of heights, I tried and had to turn around. But everything else was lush and fresh."

,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Wonderful morning spent in the cool Cloud Forest. Beautiful exhibition (both flowers and wood carvings). Cannot praise it enough.
,,Amazing...,5.0,,"...you'll surely get more than your money's worth, it was one of the best place i have been to Singapore if not the best... i loved it..."
,,Nature lovers will love it.,4.0,,"One of the conservatories of Garden by bay. A spectacular green house with a 35m high artificial mountain with man made water fall showcases plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000 meters above sea level. It's better to visit before sunset."
,,great birthday gift,5.0,,went here with my wife on her birthday. It was so scenic this place and the air con was cooling so it was a fun activity here.
,,Like a dream,5.0,,It makes me feel like I were in a different world. This is what I experience once I enter this cloud forest.It's about 35 metre talls and known as the world's tallest indoor waterfall. Must visit place in Singapore.
,,WOW,5.0,,This has to be seen to be believed. The climate is cool and damp. The top is reached by lift and stairways. Take your time and get the atmosphere. Take a camera.
,,Walk amongst the tree tops,5.0,,An enjoyable 2 hours spent in this dome. The waterfall garden is a treat. The tree top walk leads you into the clouds and to the lost world. The views all around are amazing. Your camera will be in overdrive. Don't miss this serenity.

,,Long weekend,5.0,,This is an important part of understanding the way that the Gardens function - not for the height challenged people
,,Amazing and interesting.,5.0,,"Really enjoyed a day in the gardens by the bay, the treetop walk was worth it if you don't mind hights, then the two domes were very interesting some beautiful flowers and the cloud forest was really good."
,,Autumn Getaway,5.0,,A lovely way to relax spending a few hours walking through the Cloud Forest. Great for all the family.
,,Unique and quirky,4.0,,It is more geared toward families; with the entire experience targeted to delight kids and help them gain knowledge about our environment.
,,Transformational!,5.0,,Came away with the feeling of stepping out of a science fiction movie! The sheer size of the forest with different levels and sectors is overwhelming. It is an engineering marvel apart from being very inspiring and educational.
,,Fresh and green experience,4.0,,"I like the waterfall, which is high enough and located right after the entrance gate. After walking around the garden in a sunny day, this is a perfect escape as this air conditioned conservatory provides cool and fresh air. You can see various plants here, also a short film about how global warming will affect our lives. It promotes green energy which should be used to protect our environment."
,,Hit and miss,5.0,,"If you've been to a ""rainforest"" then give this a miss as you will see nothing new. If you have never been and want to get an idea (albeit a Singaporean cleaned up version without the insects etc) then go but don't think that this is how things actually look in the ""wild"". Singapore does not do wild ! A lot of people seemed to come in just to get out of the sun."
,,Amazing,5.0,,You must do this if you go to Singapore. It was truly amazing and well worth the money. So many beautiful parts.
,,Very impressive rainforest garden.,5.0,,Worth for all ages and you can do it on a sunny or rainy day. Check out my review on gardens by the bay to find out other things you can do while there.
,,Holiday,5.0,,"What a beautiful experience. An incredible architecture design to feature a wonderful array of flowers, plants, waterfalls etc amongst mist wafting high up into the ceiling. There is a winding walkway you can take or a lift if the tourist has problems walking. You must not miss this adventure, you will be in awe."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"It's awe inspiring Singapore's own reclaimed land of greenery . Breathtaking view of the flower dome at night light as it's all lit up, a nice troll along with the plants and flowers and knowledge about the ecology of different plants , botany , overlooking marina bay sands with scenic and colorful walks - on the whole it makes a trip within a trip in the city."
,,Air conditioned beauty,5.0,,"Nice and cool inside, full of plants and water and things to explore - fun for all ages with things to learn and see. Interesting engineering of glass and steel, with multiple levels to walk through - with escalators and elevators for easy access."
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,Do take time out to visit this when you visit the Gardens by the Bay. Wonderful place and with spending time here.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Very impressive. Very clever and imaginative. The attention to detail and the engineering is very well done. The flowers are beautiful, the atmosphere calming and soothing."

,,Amazing cloud forest..,5.0,,"All I can say is that this place is just like a heaven. The moment I went inside, the chill out weather welcomes you. Its pretty cool inside. The flowers, the trees that you will see will be very unique. There is a nice walk way inside.. overall, a must see, definitely recommend.."
,,Massive plant waterfall,5.0,,One of the two plant biomes. This takes you to the top of the 'mountain' and then you can gently wander down and marvel at the variety and beauty of the plants. Take time to read the information boards which explain the ecosystem and it's fragility.
,,Worth a visit for sure,4.0,,"I would probably recommend this place more highly if I had the time to use the guided tour headphones to listen at the various stations. However, just the architecture of this feature is pretty awe inspiring and the concept is basically educational. Surprisingly, it is very cool inside in terms of temperature. Because it looks like a greenhouse, I was expecting a steam room given that the sun was out and it was 90F degrees outside. Not sure what they are using in terms of energy consumption, but I am positive it can't be cheap."
,,This is located at Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"This view will take your breath away! I have severe allergies to plants and flowers and I went here anyway and I did not regret it! Love, love, loved this experience!"
,,Very relaxing,5.0,,"We walked through here today, spending about 45 mins in there. It's a very impressive place, and as soon as we walked in, we felt a big drop in temperature, and combined with the sights and sounds of running water, we all instantly felt very relaxed and strolled through. Worthwhile."
,,Cloud forest,4.0,,We visited here and the flower dome. I'm Not into flowers but was worth a visit. It was set out really well and pleasant for a walk around before dinner. Anyone with a love for flowers would love this.

,,An excellent attraction,5.0,,"In Singapore's humid weather, this place is just like a heaven. The moment you enter inside, the chill out weather welcomes you. It is pretty cool inside so take a jacket. The flowers, the trees that you will see will be very unique. There is a nice walk way inside but no cafes which is a miss actually. But overall, a must see, definitely recommend."
,,A must visit while in Singapore,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is definitely something amazing that one should visit while in Singapore. Walking up and then coming down through a clouded forest with variety of live trees and then to think that the basic structure is all man made, is what impressed me most. You can also get a good view of Singapore and the open sea from the top."

,,Must see,5.0,,One of the most beautiful flower and rain forest gardens I have ever seen. Well worth the time to visit.
,,Relaxing and refreshing experience,5.0,,Indoor gardens with beautiful waterfall and cloud walk. You start at the top and work your way down across bridges and different viewpoints. Very cold inside which is a nice relief from the humidity.
,,A lost world,4.0,,Went on a rainy day so it was really cold & misty because of the waterfall. Luscious greeneries of mostly found in Gulley's & jungles. There were no edible ferns found. It's nicely laud out & it was amazing
,,2nd visit still amazed,5.0,,Visited the cloud forest 2 years ago and again in oct 2016 and it is still a unique experience to see. The board walk out and around the waterfall and plants is excellent. The plants and flowers are amazing. A must see while in Singapore.
,,Mesmerising experience,5.0,,This is a not to be missed experience in Singapore. This is a unique creation. After entrance a huge artificial waterfall welcomes you. The ticket for entrance is 28 S dollars.

,,Awesome!!!,5.0,,A must see. We came twice. At night and then in the day. Better in the day time. A remarkable experience. I would go again next time in Singapore.
,,Nice Wonder to Visit,5.0,,It gives a pleasant surprise what Singapore has made indoors. The place is cool with lot of plants and a refreshing atmosphere.
,,The place where you should go at Singapore,3.0,,"The price is quite expensive, but much worth it than the flower dome which next to it. It's show the technology of the building and the consequences of the climate change. You will see how environmental friendly of this building. And the forest walk also exciting to walk."
,,Amazingly crazy,5.0,,It has a huge watefalls and it was breathtaking. It is very informative especially with the climate change.
,,Cool in the heat of Singapore,4.0,,For those who like plants and experiencing rainforest walks this is a great place on a hot day to cool down. It is well worth avisit
,,Night visit a must,5.0,,"My husband is afraid of heights, which I feel is important to say here.

The waterfall is very tall, but worth the walk down the walk way around the dome, even my husband said he would do it again..... later

we visited the cloud dome at night when it's all lit up and very very pretty.

Would do this again 100%"
,,Beautiful place remind you the future in space!,4.0,,"This garden reminds you someday in the future. In the future memory of being. Someday some place (most probably a planet) human build these kind of gardens. And Singaporean high-tech groups inside the industry and academic world love to show off these kind of facilities. I like this place, and walking through the place I was thinking about near future projects in energy, space gardening which is under study currently."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It reminds you of actually being in front of a waterfall and provides sensational feeling. The sound of water pouring down the huge rock makes you seem chilly and comfortable. It is a long way up and a long way down but it is worth the wait and the walk. Outside the dome, you are able to view the magnificent river that takes you through to Malaysia and the China Sea. Might be a little pricey for those looking for a touristic site."
,,Beautiful vertical garden,5.0,,We throughly enjoyed this display. It's air conditioned environment is great on a hot humid or wet day.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,A great exhibit . The waterfalls and top of the world walkway is a must take part in. The is a couple of hours event. We went on a Monday and small crowds. Small admission fee.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Walking into this we were instantly amazed by the sheer scale of the place . Tumbling waterfalls greet you and as you make your way around it seems to be wow all the way. Don't miss it.
,,Awesome and inspiring,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a must for any visitor to Singapore, in my opinion. It's educational, awe inspiring and incredibly relaxing as you spiral your way down this incredible sight along the suspended pathways."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"All I can say it's one of the best things I've done in Singapore. The plants, the art and the set up. I went on an evening and wasn't crowded. It's one thing I'd do again."
,,Amazing and fascinating,5.0,,Amazing and fascinating forest biodome. Waterfalls and small chutes interpersed by walls of plants and flower of thousands species. Spiralling walkpath from the top goes through patches of plants interpersed with wood scupltures of birds and mammals all made from wood roots.
,,Fantastic vegetative experience,5.0,,"Fantastic vegetative experience. The upper walkways are freaky as they are essentially open - the screened walkway has a narrow solid strip in the middle. Vertigo inducing if you do not enjoy heights. Still, well worth the discomfort while walking among the fantastic plants."
,,Awesome,3.0,,It is a very perfect tourist spot. Most of the tourist really visit this place so it is really a must to visit it. Worth the money!
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful, great conservation work ! A biodiversity you might not ever see again... In a few words : definitely worth a visit"
,,This is so beautiful - recommended,5.0,,Amazing place to visit and do the Cloud Walk - I loved Gardens By The Bay as there are so many things to photograph - recommended
,,Love it!!,5.0,,"This is an amazing attraction and a must see when you visit Singapore. So very beautiful at day or night. Amazing attraction & took lots of photos, just wish we had more time to sit & enjoy the views!!"
,,"Its next Gardens by the Bay , buy ticket together",5.0,,With money they tried to recreate everything. Visit the place to understand money can buy anything. fantastic breath taking felt like visited Western Ghats Again don't try to analyze with pictures and words
,,Fantastic Experience for a Local!,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the other domes at Gardens by the Bay. The location was rather accessible as the nearest mrt station is Bayfront, a 10 mins walks is all you need to get to Gardens by the Bay.

The Cloud Forest clearly stands out for me as the highlight of the attraction as compared to Flower Dome, because of the distinctive emphasis on the cooling climate which simulate the weather of an mountainous region, the 25 meters waterfall and the walkway around the cloud forest was another highlight for me.

For tourist who wish to visit the attraction it's best to avoid the peak session (Weekends & Public Holiday) as queue could be long."
,,Splendid Waterfall & great collection of vegetation of different altitudes,5.0,,"The 'Cloud Forest' though was very different. As advised by our guide, we took the elevator to the sixth floor and walked down through sky walk. Wonderful to see how the vegetation of different altitudes has been compressed in such a space. My favorite - The waterfall - Really awe inspiring!!!"
,,Beautiful creation,4.0,,"This place is the best thing to do during the day when it's hot outside. We actually did the Singapore Flyer and took a walk from there to this dome of cloud forest. This is just next to the other dome of flower garden. We chose to do this one. The entry itself is mesmerizing as you enter to a nice waterfall which reminds you of a dense forest. The flowers are amazing. They have successfully brought a huge collection of plants and flowers from all over the world. The collection of orchids particularly is spectacular. I had never seen so much in my life. If you are a nature lover you have to visit this place. However, if you are not used to walking this place will be tiring for you."
,,Breath-taking architecture and a welcome escape from the heat of Singapore,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of 2 domes at the Gardens by the Bay. It is the more impressive of the 2, where you enter below a 25 metre waterfall and then move right to the top of the dome. As you descend, the flora changes with the climate. It is a spectacular building and fascinating visit. It is cool inside and so a very welcome escape from the heat outside. You need a good half day to visit the Gardens, together with the 2 domes. Tickets are available for 1 or 2 domes, depending on the time you have available."
,,Nice views,5.0,,"Went there with friends. It's an easy walk , great for taking in the views of marina bay. Access to the platform is by elevator. I would recommend for just about any visitor to Singapore."
,,Great!,5.0,,You must go here when you go to Gardens by the Bay. it;s fantastic! It's next to the Gardens by the Bay
,,Just Go There-Simply Great,5.0,,"Even if your not an arborist you just cannot believe the range of plants and trees on display. We spent most of the day there and went with no expectations and were completely floored by the concept and the result.
The engineering alone is well worth a visit, and you get the rest of it thrown in for nothing."
,,good 1 hour,5.0,,we visited cloud forest with young kids. There was plenty of information and if your plant lover there is plenty for you to see and enjoiy.
,,worth a visit,5.0,,We randomly came here and were lucky as we arrived just as the mist was being spayed over the plants. It is a lovely way to display all the delicate plants and so beautiful. Fascinating all the insect eating plants
,,Beautiful indoor creation,5.0,,"We have been her numerous times with our friends, family and kids and never get tired of going back. This is an unbelievably feet of modern engineering and indoor plant management. The 6-7 storey waterfall at the entrance has to be seen to believe and the diversity of plant life is truly spectacular. Would definitely recommend spending the time to visit this if you are visiting Gardens By the Bay."
,,"A good getaway from the heat, visit together with the flower dome",4.0,,"It quite a sight to see man- made rainforest in the heart of our small island.
The place is pretty and clean so it's a nice place to be at.
Look for good deals so that you can just pop in to take a stroll to escape the heat.
It's still a wow for first timers.
Not top priority but if there time and promotions , do check the place out"
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"We went here on a Sunday afternoon and it was fairly crowded, but manageable. It took about 2 hours to see everything and the cost was reasonable. We opted for the shuttle service ($3 pp)- it was in walking distance from the ticket booth, but would have probably taken 20 minutes, each direction, and it's very humid over there. Would recommend going here if you have the time."
,,Artificial mountain environ,3.0,,"Artificially created mountain flora inside a dome, with fake waterfall and peak all in place. You can go to the top and then walk down. Good collection of flowers. Nice enough to look at. Also has good views of the Marina Bay Sands from the walkway. Gets chilly and misty inside.

Not bad for a one time visit, but nothing special."
,,Great Attraction,5.0,,Really enjoyed the Cloud Forest. All the plants and waterfalls with the walk around the top and back down again. Was very informative about all the exhibits.
,,Magical Place,5.0,,"Breathtaking Forest, feels like you are somewhere in cloud jungle, not in artificial Garden created by men hand."
,,nice!!,5.0,,"I did not know there are air conditioning inside of the dorm. So, I was sooooo excited when I get inside!! And there are beautiful Botanicals, statues and even falls. I really recommend this place!! You should visit there:)"
,,Remarkable,5.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore. The whole area of Gardens by the Bay is spectacular, but the Cloud Forest could stand alone it is so amazing. Though there is a light mist you do not feel wet or cold after walking in the climate controlled area. The water fall and orchids are beautiful. Take you time once you exit you can not re-enter. Restrooms at the bottom level on the way out."
,,A Sad Scientific Marvel,4.0,,"I had the chance to visit Gardens by the Bay in September. Unbelievable things have been done, but it was seriously depressing as I realised this is how we and the future generations will be visiting the stuff that we as humans are relentlessly destroying. There are no birds but their sounds are there through some speakers, the atmosphere is designed with air-conditioning etc. It is just sad and beautiful and a scientific marvel.. a sad scientific marvel"
,,"very average place , do it only if you have extra time",2.0,,"Cloud forest I think is an over rated destination . It is just a waterfall at the entrance and bridge constructed to climb floors . Was not very exciting specially its entrance is paid It is pretty cold inside , so do take your jackets ."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Very good experience as a visitor and the way it is made and maintained, one could appreciate the thought process behind this development"
,,"Amazing experience, not just for kids",5.0,,"I loved this trip and enjoyed every moment there. The Cloud forest is great in misting time, the cold mist coming through the plants. The dragons as decoration made in more appealing tome :)"
,,Stunning and cool,5.0,,Definitely our favourite of the two domes. Walk amongst the greenery and flowers of a rainforest in super cool comfort.
,,Don't miss this!!,5.0,,One of my favourite experiences in Singapore! It's unique and really worth seeing in both day light and night. Futuristic and great sights around Singapore area.
,,I went to Singapore just to see this - worth it!,5.0,,"My whole reason for going to Singapore was to see the Gardens and the Cloud Forrest and it was great. Nice easy stroll up to the top, good for people with limited mobility and there is full disabled access. It was nice and cool inside which was a great escape from the heat. A few more cafes/eateries right out side or up the top would have been good, the food places were a bit far away."
,,A very different type of garden,5.0,,"A very different garden, not like any ordinary garden that I have seen. You take the lift up - probably 35m up and view the garden from above. The mist generated gives you the impression that you are walking amidst clouds (perhaps why it is called the Cloud forest?). The plant variety are also unique. Another interesting concept is that the super trees outside help capture solar energy and provide energy to cool the air inside here. A really cool garden!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Breathtaking and thoroughly recommended. Next time I go, I'll bring the children 😊 it takes about an hour to walk through. There is a lift so no worries with stairs."
,,Our Asian Adventure,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful. If there is one thing you want to see in Singapore. Make sure this is on your list.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This place is put together with great effort and an excellent place to spend a warm day. Flowers, Trees, Water very calming effect."
,,Fun for the whole family!,5.0,,"Such a nice experience. My son (10) loved it. he was running around like crazy, totally overwhelmed. Nice exhibition in climate change in the end."
,,Marvelous Singapore!!!,5.0,,"Thank you TripAdvisor for giving me the brief and making my trip so easy. Garden by the bay it's worth seeing. So colorful and having loads for species of flower, plants, cactus. And don't forget to walk up to the cloud forest!"
,,A nice walk,4.0,,"Even if solo, I really enjoyed visiting the cloud forest. It is s nice walk. .and the view it provides is very nice. To be combined with other attractions near by because it will not take very long"
,,Something a little different,5.0,,We are from New Zealand and don't really have anything like this back home. We really loved the cloud forest. If you are handy with a camera you could get some amazing photos in here. Even though you are inside the dome the view is beautiful looking out to the bay and at other buildings nearby. The price of entry was pretty cheap and also included the flower dome.
,,Cloud Dome,5.0,,"Cloud dome is amazing as are the waterfall and plants flowers, the walkway is easy to walk along and enjoy the views"
,,Amazing,5.0,,The Cloud forest dome is totally amazing. We spent far longer than we expected in there and enjoyed the cool fog descend on us when the misting system created the artificial clouds. Even non plant lovers would enjoy the experience.
,,Indoor garden city,5.0,,Indoor garden with a nice chill from the air conditioning. Definitely good for a hot day or even a rainy day. The indoor water fall is definitely something cool and different and the sky walk was a fun activity to do.
,,Amazing,5.0,,A fascinating place and well worth a visit. We really enjoyed this and found it very interesting. Highly recommend.
,,Not as good as a real forest,2.0,,"Don't get me wrong, it looks spectacular from the outside and from a distance, but when you get up close and personal it's all too obviously man-made, with pipes, steps, concrete, walkways, jets of steam and loads of people getting in your way.

The idea is that it focuses on plants that grow at high altitudes in perma-mist, so every so often they squirt mist in, which is nice.

Worst of all, the guts of the forest tower is filled with random exhibits like a crystal room and at the bottom you get ambushed with an apocalyptic climate-change presentation that makes you feel guilty for even being alive.

Here's an idea - save the planet by not building greenwash monstrosities that masquerade as environmentally friendly do-goodery.

Not impressed. Not a must-see at all."
,,Nice Cloud Forest,5.0,,It is very nice here. It is cold and very nice walking up stairs and going down. It is nice to take a photo in the water falls. Nice indeed.
,,Amazing forest and trees,5.0,,The theme was south Africa. Amazing number of flowering plants existing besides all the trees that has been grown from around the world. The keep rotating the theme of the flowers so it changes every 3 months which makes this place quite interesting. Good place to visit to appreciate nature
,,One of my favourite places to bring visitors.,4.0,,Never failed to wow them. There are so many species of flora that are artfully presented. The air-conditioned dome is also a pleasant respite for hot or rainy days.
,,Cloud effect in cool weather in hot Singapore,5.0,,It was a good experience to be able to enjoy nature in a cooling environment in hot Singapore. Lots of flowers species to learn from. It gets too crowded during the holidays
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"I was so fascinated by this attraction the first time I cam here with a Friend. Even though this is a man-made attraction, it felt close to nature. The flowers were beautiful and vibrant. The whole experience was educational and interesting."
,,in the clouds,4.0,,It is very massive waterfall view as you enter Cloud forest. Bring a jacket as it is hot in the outside and the sudden drop in temperature. It is beautiful to walk the entire route and I try it even though I have a fear of heights and I've managed as the sight is beautiful. Go check it out for yourself.
,,Enchanting Forest,5.0,,"If you are not blown away by the spectacular waterfall immediately after entering the forest, very little else would excite you I am afraid. Feel the rush and energy of the cascading water as you enter the cool of the dome. Make your way slowly to the top of the forest, then wind your way down again along the scenic foot bridge. Be amazed by all the varieties of flora and be transported away into the middle of a mythical green paradise."
,,Beautiful and well presented,5.0,,"This place is amazing, and so easy to find your way around. You are guided along a path that takes you through various parts of a tropical forest. The waterfalls and other water features are gorgeous, as well as how the man made features integrate very well with nature."
,,Must see in Singapore !,5.0,,"The new Gardens By The Bay not only feature the amazing Supertrees ( as a free thing to do, especially at sundown and stay into the night for the light show) ... The Cloud Forrest is one of two domes at the gardens as a MUST SEE & pay for entry - there is a 2 ticket deal to include the Flower Dome which is not really worth it if you are on a budget. You will spend at least 45 mins in the Cloud Forest enjoying the cool mist from the largest indoor water fall & stunning flora and fauna."
,,Cool atmosphere area,5.0,,Man made waterfall and sky walk. A cool place to be in if outside is too hot. Top and bottom view are both awesome.
,,Nice and Cool,4.0,,"Had a awesome experience at cloud forest last month, it takes you to completely different environment. Cool and windy."
,,Nature Designed,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest gives you a surreal feeling of walking in the cool woods with ease. It's eco designed with a system of sustainability. Enjoy the waterfall, green foliage, amazing flowers....go to the top and take a slow walk down to appreciate and admire the greenery and exhibits....stress reliever and good for your eyes!"
,,If you have nothing to do,2.0,,"This place is just so artificial that I would prefer a natural forest or jungle anytime. But if you have the time and nothing to do you can visit. Go to the Botanical Gardens, it is much better."
,,Really amazing,5.0,,Photos cannot do this place justice. Cavernous and awe-inspiring architecture. A must-see for tourists visiting town.
,,Nice and Cool Attraction!,5.0,,"We went to the Cloud Forest as we had some discounted tickets. Was raining that day so this was a great way to spend a rainy day. The waterfall was pretty awesome (for a man made waterfall) and we really enjoyed the walk on the walkway in the clouds. Everything was misty and I thought it was pretty romantic.

Kind of cool inside the place so you might need a light sweater or cardigan."
,,Cool place to visit,5.0,,"Fun place to visit. Great atmosphere. Good place to walk around and enjoy the views. Not too crowded. Not a must see, but if you have the time it's fun."
,,Highest artificial indoor waterfall,5.0,,"It's just next building to the Flower dome. Visited on Saturday. Not too crowded.
Whole building is air-conditioned.
The waterfall is so beautiful. You can climb the waterfall and have a good view of Marina bay sands hotel and the flyer.
The ticket for both flower dome and Cloud Forest was purchased from Changi Airport tourist information stall for S$29."
,,A must see,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this, such a great place to see. It's also a cool place to be. Definitely put this on your list of must sees in Singapore."
,,A Great Experience,5.0,,This is a great place to visit. Make sure you visit both domes and do the sky walk in the forest dome.
,,Loved it but soo crowded!!,4.0,,"It surely is a special place, what they have achieved in here is amazing, it is absolutely gorgeous creating its own clouds within the dome and of course the waterfall is spectacular. However choose your time to go wisely. We went on a Saturday afternoon/evening and it was so crowded we were being pushed along by the sheer numbers of others ""enjoying"" it.
So yes it was my favourite part of Gardens by the Bay and I think I would have enjoyed it more though should I have gone at a different time of the day/week. Over-popularity can spoil anything special."
,,Not for repeats,4.0,,"As SG is a city that requires walking, this attraction is good for one visit only, second visit is not a good idea. It will ask you to do uphill walking through metal pathways going to the top with nothing much special to see. As many times that I can visit Gardens by the Bay, sorry for Cloud Forest but a second time is already too much. By chance, I got to see CF at night and getting pictures is always a terrible mess. Try to visit it with natural light if your priority is pictures. But at night, city view at the top is quite interesting."
,,"very interesting, well worth an afternoon",5.0,,"Very interesting, beautiful well kept gardens. You can go up one of the ""trees"" and have a drink and look over Singapore. I think it cost about $10 each but you got a complimentary drink at the top,"
,,Absolutely Stunning,5.0,,"Pay the money and visit this place; you won't regret it. The Cloud Dome creates eco-systems that are endangered throughout the world - and yes it does include real clouds. Absolutely stunning, and all yours for 16 Singapore Dollars if you're over 60. Fantastic."
,,Even though I don't like heights,5.0,,Not that great at heights but this has to be done. It's well planned and feels like a little adventure as you climb to the top and then work your way down.
,,man made marvel.,4.0,,it is better to visit the cloud forest since there is a variety of things to see.dont miss the mist that they cover the cloud forest with every hour.you really feel u r in the clouds.there is an elevator for people who find it difficult to climb.the flowers too r beautiful.worth the walk.buy tickets for both the flower dome too.
,,Just for pictures,3.0,,You can see the indoor garden and click pictures. An artificial waterfall at entrace is worth view. Not highly recommended place.
,,Good to See,4.0,,it is in Gardens by the Bay. you can go there by metro & it is 10 min walk from metro station. Notice inside is cold.
,,Lovely attraction,5.0,,"Beautifully made, great concept, much of it is actually like New Zealand so we felt quite at home. Great to have an air conditioned building too! Lovely waterfall and you are able to walk up through the forest. Great photo ops and educational material talking about damage to the planet- there is a film and information to read. Also some info on caves."
,,makes me feel like indiana jones.,5.0,,even wanted to go to Amazon the forest? well this Cloud Forest might be able to give you a glimpse of how it would feel like. but please visit on the weekdays if you want a bit of tranquility. h
,,The absolute highlight of our trip. Not to be missed.,5.0,,If you do one thing in Singapore - make it this. It is well worth the entrance fee and will leave you in awe about the balance that can be achieved between architecture and nature.
,,amazing,5.0,,"This place blew my mind probably because I wasn't expecting to see something like this in Singapore. It was my very first time in that country and therefore everything was a surprise, but this indoor forest, enclosed in such a cool structure, up there, is quite impressive. Must see in Singapore."
,,Do not miss it,5.0,,"Do not miss cloud forest and flower dome. They are both worth it. We were amazed by the plants, the wooden sculptures and everything in there!"
,,One of the best eco experiences,5.0,,"This is an outstanding attraction within the Gardens by the Bay, reproducing 2000m of altitude variation in one huge conservatory /glasshouse. Sobering facts on the damage we're doing to the planet, but educational and throughly enjoyable at the same time."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"This is built with great precision and with Brilliant Vision, and great Concept, wish I could visit it every year"
,,Incredible,5.0,,They managed to create an attraction like non others! An artificial garden naturally air-conditioned that creates a near perfect habitat very much different from what you can actually expect visiting a tropical place.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Its like something out of a sci-fi movie. I enjoyed walking on the ramps high above the foliage. We were there during a misting, which was good fun. The short movie documenting environmental change till 2100 was excellent, and very sobering to contemplate. Its kinda cold in there, so best take a wrap or a light jersey."
,,Great place to visit to escape the heat,5.0,,"I visited this dome first, and I think it is the best of the two domes. When you first enter you are greeted by a massive waterfall. It was quite a busy place, so while I wandered around on my own, it was a bit difficult to find a quiet place."
,,Simply Amazing,5.0,,This is a must see if in Singapore. The scale and attention to detail is superb. Even if you're not into flora and fauna you will enjoy this.
,,Simply incredible!,5.0,,"What an amazing attraction. It's a must place to visit. Every conceivable plant, shrub
and tree you can imagine all under huge air conditioned glass house. The waterfall is a must see and take the lift to the viewing point near the top. Take a camera as it's a
photographers paradise."
,,Amazingly Artificial,4.0,,"An interesting place/attraction in Singapore to visit. The place is jam-packed with tourists during weekends, so it's better to plan your visit during weekdays. As soon as you enter the dome you will be welcomed by the cool and misty air which I really enjoyed. It's amazing to imagine your inside an encapsulated forest. The only thing that I hate is the way they designed the lifts, we find it very inconvenient transferring to another level with a baby stroller."
,,Singapore cloud forest,5.0,,"Artificial cloud forest is near the river bed in singapore. It is one of the tourist attraction. Different types of plants, trees are there. Children will enjoy water falls. It gave a feeling that we are moving inside the forest. Entrance fee is charged. Well maintained."
,,A Chilled Place To Chill,4.0,,"The cloud forest, like the flower dome and other Garden by the Bay spots, is a delightful yet simple place to visit. I particularly enjoyed the nighttime visit, when the entire facility takes on an alien-encounter feel (especially around the time of misting). A few words of warning though - if you're prone to getting cold, bring a sweater; if you are really interested in learning about the structure and its occupants, finding and reading the signs after sundown can be difficult, as the place is quite dark."
,,A Cool Walk Through The Forest,4.0,,"Wow! The second that we walked in was the waterfall. It was so cool to look at a waterfall in Singapore! It was also pleasantly cool in the forest. Do bring your camera and there's loads of photos you can take, even with the Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. I went with my parents and my family and we were there at 4pm on a Sunday. After the waterfall, take the lift to the highest floor and walk down. It is very wheelchair/pram/stroller friendly. Bring a selfie stick - you want to take so many photos. It was a very awesome walk through the forest - so cool and refreshing! Thereafter we went to the Flower Dome and spent a lovely evening at the Gardens By the Bay where we saw the 'dancing lights'"
,,Spectacular amazing waterfall in a forest,5.0,,Never did I expect a stunning impressive man-made waterfall in my own country. Was captivated by the huge enormous waterfall with its fascinating sound & ever changing colourful laser lights (evening is the best time to visit). Take a tour around the inner side of waterfall & once you reached the top you'll find a scenic view of the Garden by the Bay & Marina Bay Sands! One of the MUST visit attraction places in Singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"From the time you enter the hall and get hit with the moist cool air, to the views from the top, this was our favourite attraction in Singapore. Highly recommended."
,,very impressive place!,5.0,,"clever design for giant mountain and cloud walk way, plants and good exhibition about the earth. Even artificial natural stuff with some real plants, it's worth for your visit. all in all, we like a cool air inside:)"
,,Superb and must visit,5.0,,"Even if you are not a flower enthusiast this place is a must visit! You will be walking around an artificial waterfall from the base to the peak. Pram friendly - which is a real bonus if you are visiting with young children. The flowers and plants are beautiful and memorable. Try to go at the ""misting times"" as that's an awesome feeling - you will feel as if you are in an actual forest. Lots of scenic points to get some lovely photos!

They have escalators and lifts as well so you can quickly go from one level to the next if you dont feel like walking"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,Awesome falls. you get to walk around the hanging bridge around the falls. one of a kind experience.
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,"Brought the family along to see the beauty of these delightful gardens. My children were expecting a boring normal garden but were so excited to see how truly amazing it was, they couldn't stop taking photos."
,,Only in Singapore,4.0,,"Totally artificial and, despite the steam and heat in this compelety artificial environment, there were no clouds! BUT - it was a worthwhile trip with lots to see, and beautifully kept."
,,marvelous,5.0,,truly marvelous piece of work. couldn't believe human are that capable. enjoyed every bit of it. another must visit in Singapore.
,,Like it,5.0,,I like this Forest the best. It is so fresh and cool. People are so smart to build it artificially like that. Nice place to visit
,,Walkway to the clouds,5.0,,"This is one of the most amazing things I have been to (and i have travelled extensively) it is very humid inside due to the dome roof and all the gorgeous living plants so be sure to take bottles of water with you.

The waterfall, gardens plants inside are stunning, add to this the most amazing views across the bay and across the super trees and it really is a don't miss experience

Don't let a fear of heights put you off entering here, the walk path on the 4th level is quite easy to walk out on for even people with a bad case of scared of heights, it loops out and around from one side to the other.

There are lifts and escalators to get you up and down all the different levels and areas,

Male sure you take your camera !"
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,Amazed by the whole concept where there's a waterfall inside the building and how they manage to bring in various types of plants which can only be found in higher altitude places.
,,A piece of nature encapsulated in the future,5.0,,"Beautiful place, especially for families with kids. The attraction delivers the Singapore classic clean, simple, informative style and the architecture of it is simply beautiful. A good escape from Singapore's humid and hot weather."
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,"This very beautiful place is a must see attraction. Isolated from outside atmosphere, so very good to visit on sunny hot day."
,,Impressive indoor forest,5.0,,"Quite hard to describe the impression this place leaves on you. Even as someone with little interest in fauna I couldn't help but be impressed by this building - so lush, light and spacious. The waterfall is lovely and the views from the elevated walkways (of both of the 'mountain' and the surrounding city) were fantastic. We went at dusk too so we're able to enjoy the sunset and lights of the city. Didn't time our visit to coincide with the two hourly cloud formation unfortunately. The ecological messages delivered in the spaces within the mountain were also very compelling and sobering."
,,A different world in tropical Singapore,5.0,,"The blast of cold wet wind greeting you as you step into that dome signals a different world you are about to visit. Throw in some wildlife and you will be forgiven to think that you are in the South American highlands!

A worthy complement to the Flower Dome."
,,Forest at the CIty,4.0,,Great structure at the city having Singapore's famous attractions as your background. Cool place with waterfalls fronting the entrance. You will also have a chance to go up and have a good look at the view.
,,Wow wow and fantastic,5.0,,I did love the cloud forest Stunning display of beautiful orchids trees and plants a must and affordable visit on your next stop
,,Unimaginably Innovative,5.0,,"Kudos to the minds who designed and conceptualised the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. We were quite surprised and taken aback by the enormity of the dome design. The waterfall was interested and refreshing with a rainbow near the ground. The kids were quite excited and enjoyed a lot, though they were tired. A must visit again n again.."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,Nice to walk around and be reminded to care for our forests. The place is friendly for wheelchair or people with kids on stroller. We went early evenin so it wasnt too hot. But food in this area is pricey but for the price you pay its mediocre at best.
,,Love love love!,5.0,,Certainly a must see for all ages! An indoor misty rainforest which allows you got get up close and personal with the plants. Amazing! Worth seeing along with the Flower Garden next door.
,,A must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,A great outing whether transiting through with a 6 plus hours between flights or staying for a few days or more. Well worth the experience with exceptional plant life from around the world.
,,Family visit,5.0,,Well worth the visit .Cool inside but beautiful to visit.Visited at night and was not only pretty but educational.
,,Amazing visit,5.0,,This place is very fun to see and walk around. Giant waterfall with lots of info on climate. Good for a walkthrough.
,,Cool place to visit,3.0,,I enjoyed the cloud forest but after coming from the botanic gardens I wasn't sure it was worth the time and money. The plants and flowers are beautiful but you can also see them at the botanic gardens. The cloud forest was crowded and while I'm glad I went I don't think it is something I would visit again.
,,Wow again,5.0,,"it was amazing one not to be missed, very well laid out, good for everyone, take a mac with you because you could get wet especially if you want to"
,,Beautiful and abundant,5.0,,"This dome is found in the Gardens by the Bays garden. Loved it, as you had to walk around a number of areas which were different to the other. At particular times, it had a mist ""show"" which I highly highly recommend to see and be there, as it made the dome cool and it was a beautiful view of mist falling from the ""sky"" and other sections."
,,good for family trips,5.0,,"if you're in sing for few days, surely you should step inside this cloud forest. beautiful views, for all ages."
,,Interesting,4.0,,This is a reconstruction of a rain forest environment. Very informative and beautiful plants . Not sure it is worth the entrance price but as you don't pay for the rest of the gardens we didn't mind. Watch out for the rain showers!
,,Simply the Best & Very Refreshing!,5.0,,Such a unique manmade cloud forest. Buy tickets that includes the Flower Dome. A very refreshing place.
,,Enchanting,5.0,,Well worth a visit. The attention to detail and the care with which this exhibition has been created is fabulous and quite unique. Demonstrates the scope of progressive thinking and planning to ensure Singapore remains a terrific tourist destination.
,,"""Artificial, bland and overrated"".",2.0,,"Not to sure why people go gaga over this attraction. Don't get me wrong. Architecturally, the cloud forest is quite unique, As soon as you enter the cloud forest you are greeted by a massive man made waterfall. Here you see people scrambling around like headless chooks, trying to get photos, selfies, etc.I went on a weekend, so it was pretty crowded. After the initial euphoria, you continue along a path lined with endless plants, flowers, wood carvings/statutes of dragons. lions, fairies and LEGO, yes LEGO bricks of all things, and so on. Then you are huddled into a lift that takes you up to the so called ""cloud walk""-basically a bridge that winds it way down the cloud forest. The cloud forest 35-metre-tall mountain is not totally covered in lush vegetation, you can see pipes, metal beams and large gaping holes, After a while it does get monotonous. I soon realize, it is all too artificial, sterile, cold, lacking character and ultimately another touristy attraction meant to rake in your hard earn dollars. It was like a nirvana moment, at least for me. After that I headed straight for the exit. The staff at the exit asked me if I wanted a re-entry stamp, I declined, as the cloud forest will be a one off expedition for me. Verdict : Only suitable for amateur travelers."
,,A spectacular garden,4.0,,"A spectacular garden in a controlled temperature and nice and peaceful ambient. We started the walk from the top level. I experience a small degree of fear for the height while walking down the spiraling slope.

Flower and plants at each level is always a surprise and i especially love one of chamber where there is the stalagtite, stalagmite and the crystal.

As we have visited the flower dome and the cloud forest, it gets colder as we walked so it would be advisable to bring along a jacket and pair of walking shoe would be perfect.

The lego artwork in the cloud forest that goes with the natural landscape is awesome."
,,Superb Place,5.0,,"This is an amazing place, dont go to Singapore and not do it, it is beautiful, and a great place to get out of the heat! 100% value for money!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Beautiful water fall is the fish thing you can see when you walk inside. They have 6-7 floors & the skyline for walking. Each floor explains abou the earth and climate.
,,Interesting engineering,4.0,,Quite a feat of engineering! It's a glasshouse on the equator and is cool inside. Caution: You need a head for heights to visit this attraction. Interesting plant exhibits. Well organised. I would describe this attraction as interesting rather than wow!
,,An Oasis on the Bay,5.0,,"After walking around outside through the Marina Bay Gardens, it was like entering a cool magical oasis.

The entire experience was beautiful, relaxing and visually spectacular. You don’t need to be a plant or flower buff – this is something you must visit when in Singapore.

Lush green plants, amazing ranges of orchids, trees, artistic sculptures and a great view from the skywalk. The building itself is impressive let alone what’s inside.

Tip – Go around 3pm as we left it a bit too late in the afternoon and it started to get dark so it was difficult to see the plants etc towards the end. Also the flower dome is best in daylight."
,,Great choice to see something new and spectacular!,4.0,,Amazing biotechnology went into design and engineering this attraction! You must see this place if you go to Singapore! Great for staying out of the heat in the middle of the day!
,,Awesome,5.0,,"I loved the cloud forest the most in gardens by the bay , something different, the place is very clean and colourful"
,,I wish I could come up with the words that do this place justice.,5.0,,"This has to be the best thing I have seen in Singapore .. probably the best thing I have seen in all my travels.

The Cloud Forest has to be seen to be believed ... there aren't words than can describe the magic of this place.

The flowers and plants that grow here are from places up to 6000 feet above sea level.

There is a 100 foot waterfall and you can actually look out from behind it at various levels up to the top.

All of this is covered by a space age glass cover without a corner in it ... it's cool and relaxing and if I lived in Singapore, I would pay to come here once a week to just relax.

So if you are in Singapore ... go here before you decide to go anyplace else."
,,so-so,3.0,,"I was expecting this dome to be amazing. However my expectations failed me. Don't get me wrong, this place is nice. But its not as amazing as the pictures. The manmade waterfall is a good example. I can still see the pipe where the water comes from--I don't get that feel. Inside is kinda like a museum, which is a spectacular idea. But overall, with the price I need to pay to enter, its a one time entry for me."
,,Be prepared to be wowed.,5.0,,This is my second time here in 12 months and im still amazed with its beauty. Spent over 2 hours in here and loved it. Air conditioned for comfort
,,amazing,5.0,,Take the time to see this when in Singapore. How they do it all is quite amazing and priced well too
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"As it was raining we decided to go somewhere indoors to escape the weather. We are so glad we did. This is an excellent exhibit and a credit to its designers. We stayed for the ""misting"" which really does give the whole place a different feel. I suggest you take a light coat as it can feel chilly inside. Take your time to go round as there's lots to see. Not sure I'm a big fan of the juxtaposed wooden sculptures and Lego (yes, Lego) but they didn't detract. We bought a joint ticket with the flower done. Unless you are not familiar with Western flowers/horticulture or unless you are a keen gardener, I don't think you'll miss a great deal if you don't do the flower dome."
,,Refresh with the cool atmosphere,5.0,,"Lost in Gardens by the bay, where you find the tarzan boy inside you. After exploring the Flower Dome, you should enter Cloud Forest to enjoy the cool air and magnificent scene from the skywalk up high after taking the elevator. Before that, the waterfall with many photoshoot would be recommended."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,This is such a beautiful place ...just the experience refreshes you... a must visit ...the view from the top is just fab.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"I wasn't that keen on seeing this dome, but it was amazing. Being able to go to the top of the waterfall and walk down and behind was incredible enough without the beauty of for flora and fauna."
,,A place to cool don and admire with beauty,5.0,,"Take a taxi or the MRT to Bayfront after walking through the gardens to the domes you will need to cool down we only had a limited time so we paid $16 for the one dome (it is cheaper for both) Once inside you are immediately blown away with the cascading waterfall in front of you , seeing people walking underneath you know you're in for a treat and it doesn't disappoint. We spent 1 1/2 hours admiring the gardens, the view from the walkways high up is fabulous ."
,,unbelievable,5.0,,what they could built under roof. interesting walk through different levels of nature. can only recommend this
,,Beautiful plants to enjoy,4.0,,"A pleasant place to visit as it is indoors. You can have a good time here, egardless of the weather."
,,Coolest place in Singapore,5.0,,"I thought I was going to be melted, visiting a large greenhouse in 34 degree heat, but turns out the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome are both extensively air conditioned, in fact if you are suffering with the heat definitely go for a visit, the spray coming off the waterfall is very cooling! That aside the floral exhibits are wonderful, I am no flower expert but really enjoyed the walk around, it is meticulously kept in top condition and has a brilliant collection of plants to see. There are also an amazing amount of wood carvings to be seen that have been done from logs and tree trunks and lots of creations made from scraps. The gardens themselves are free to walk around, the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are charged at $38 SGD not too bad when you consider what's in them. You can also add $3 to your ticket and use the shuttles around the park all day, worthwhile if you are not a walking fan."
,,Cloud Forest is amazing,4.0,,"It's worth a visit. The waterfall creates a scenery that is unique and different to the rest of Singapore. If there is limited time, choose this over the flower dome."
,,Very well made artificial waterfall and cloud forest,4.0,,A nice place to be to escape the heat and humidity in Singapore. Very beautifully made and conserved artificial cloud forest.Wont appeal us much as we have better cloud forest and waterfalls back home in India but the efforts taken for building and conserving the place are praiseworthy.Definitely worth a visit. Also the effort to highlight the consequences of Global warming and deforestation through the small film and presentations are commendable.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,What a great place to explore very interesting and lovely experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would recommend it to visitors visiting Singapore.
,,Time Well Spent,5.0,,"This Cloud Forest is set in the Gardens By The Bay. You need to pay S$28 entry for this and the Flower Dome. The waterfall is beautiful and the plants are lovely including the different orchids, moss from Tasmania, ferns and Venus fly traps. You start at the bottoms of the waterfall and work your way up and back down again finishing at the Secret Garden. This really was a lovely Forrest walk."
,,A cool visit,4.0,,"This is my son's favorite hangout, the cool air (can be chilling for some, like me, so pls bring along a cardigan or thin windbreaker if you don't like the wind or the water splashing on you) that greet us on e you enter, the water droplets splashing from the men make water fall, it really doesn't matter what's the temperature outside . The Cloud Forest has seven levels and two overhanging bridges that allows you to walk around the outside and have a good look at the all ferns and florals that grew out from the 'cliff'. Beware! The bridges/walkway are see through type so for the faint heart, don't look down...

Compare to the flower dorm that exhibit flowers in different seasons and changes their themes, cloud forest doesn't change that much, but for those who love seeing plants/vegetation or even flowers that grow from their 'natural habitat', this is the place to visit."
,,I would like to visit it again,5.0,,It was really so interesting and so great to visit the cloud forest.they showing an amazing informations about the earth& weather. A really good way to educate the visitors about how they shoul reacting and thinking about earth planet ?
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,"You see this wonderful structure from the outside then when you go in the look, the smells the whole thing is just so magnificent. A must see in Singapore."
,,"Loved it, amazing!",5.0,,"Singapore sure knows how to do amazing attractions. We loved this, amazing plants, waterfalls, mists, displays and views. Quite a unique experience."
,,Wow - what a first impact when walking inside,5.0,,"This, like the Flower Dome next door is expensive to visit - $28 - but it is worth it for the amount of work that has been put into the amazing display within the dome. It is very different to the flower dome next door. You are greeted by a massive waterfall when arriving into the dome and a series of tropical plantings that are situated at their natural heights within the various floors of the dome. It is also much higher than the flower dome and the view from the upper levels of the surrounding skyline is stunning. Not for those who don't like heights though. Like the flower dome, the temperature in here is cold, so bring a coat if you don't want to freeze whilst inside here. I particularly recommend this dome for a visit at night to take in the full impact of the skyline lights from the upper level viewing platforms. We visited just before their last entrance at 7.30pm and there was no line/queue."
,,A garden not to be missed,5.0,,"We loved visiting the cloud forest. As we walked through the doors we were greeted by cool air which was a welcome relief from the unbelievable heat.
The waterfall was exquisite and the range of plants and flowers were amazing.
There was also a funky garden made from Lego which was fun."
,,Mesmerising!,5.0,,A spectacular display. Thoroughly enjoyed this visit. It really is a forest and you get to explore it at different levels - into the clouds! Great sense of tranquility. Highly recommended.
,,Excellent place to visit with family and friends,4.0,,"The entrance to the cloud forest was magnificent. The thundering sound of water from the huge waterfall and gush of cool wind when I entered excited me. The smell of fresh greens reminded me of Cameron Highlands.

Walking the elevated platforms and taking in the sights from up there refreshed me.

Wonderful place to spend the day with family and friends.

Just to be sure to come either in the mornings or early afternoon. I came at around 1pm and managed to enter without much queue. However, when I exited at around 3pm, the queue to enter was really really long.."
,,Worth the hike!,4.0,,Went up the steep steps. It was so majestic and it felt like going through an actual rain forest up in the clouds. Even suitable for young kids and kids at heart.
,,A slice of Tropical forest!,5.0,,The cloud forest is really a great place for nature lovers where you can get to see multiple varieties of exotic tropical plants and savour their aromas and vivid colors under one dome. The artificial falls help in maintaining the temperature inside and are also a great prop for taking a' touristy' click!
,,Amazing to see. Must do,5.0,,From the minute you walk in to this aircon chilled space. thr pleasant scenary of lowers. water and amazing wood items all around the place. Take a slow walk and look all around to see allot of things that are just not pointed out or advertised. A very nice walk in up and around. amazingly setup up and organised. well done to Singapore for this.
,,Wow!!! You must go,5.0,,"I've been to many botanical gardens, and while this is not the official botanical garden of Singapore, it was incredible. Took MRT to Gardens by the Bay. Entrance to Cloud Forest is a short stroll or buggy ride from metro stop. Design and quality is unlike any I've seen. Entirely indoors, and surprisingly cool given the tropical climate indoors. Take the elevator to top, and spend about an hour strolling down the causeway. I took some great photos and it was a nice break from heat and bustle of the city. A must visit!!!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was so amazing and fantastic place to visit in a hot afternoon in Singapore as it is so cool in there. Must do while visiting Singapore.
,,Spectacular Light Show.,5.0,,"Go late in the day, see the gardens, have something to eat or drink, then once it gets dark you can enjoy a wonderful light and music show. Take a lift to the top of one tower and enjoy a ""tree walk"" high up with views over Singapore."
,,Impressive attempt to re-create nature,5.0,,"The first impression is wonderful waterfall, is a good substitute for a real waterfall. It never fail to awe my son every time we visit. The temperate is kept at cool 20 deg Celsius which offer respite from the punishing topical heat ."
,,Fantastic. Can buy tickets for just Cloud Forest if you like,5.0,,"There's probably not too much that I can add to the multitude of previous reviews.
However, the thing that doesn't seem to have been mentioned is that as a non-local, it IS possible to buy a ticket for just one 'conservatory' (i.e. the flower dome or the cloud forest).
The price list on the website indicates that non-locals can only buy a $28 ticket for both attractions, but if you ask at the desk, you can buy a $16 ticket for just one conservatory.
I thought that the Cloud Forest was fantastic. As well as being refreshing, I just found it a peaceful and welcoming place to be. There was a huge range of foliage and greenery, but I enjoyed just taking it in and looking at the amazing spectacle that they'd created. They do a mist on every 'even hour'. It's quite cool to see, but if your timing doesn't coincide, I wouldn't wait around for it..."
,,Absolutely fascinating!,5.0,,"We were all freezing inside because of the cooler temperature and the water, but the view was amazing. We ended up staying there for a few hours ... there are lots to see. Strongly recommended, but bring a jacket!"
,,An amazing place at night,5.0,,"We had come on the Monday and the cloud was closed so managed to pop back.
It was well worth the trip as this place has a real space age feel to it!
As we had dinner in between the two dimes the evening was drawn in and the place had a fantasy look with the lights from around marina bay.

Take the car shuttle to save your legs!

Supatrees lights show was awesome too"
,,"Not to be ""mist""",5.0,,Totally unexpected treat. The displays of flowers and plants were extraordinary and beautiful with information on everything. Amazing waterfall and the walkways going right to the very top this really is a place not to miss. This was the highlight of our trip to Singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Must see attraction with amazing plants, flowers, and wooden sculptures, all enclosed in a super large glass dome which is pleasantly air conditioned."
,,A lovely attraction in the tropical island,3.0,,"Its a lovely attraction with quite a bit to see and offer an opportunity to stroll in the 'open' without the humidity of a tropical island
Allow yourself a good portion of the day to get there and explore the area. If you plan to head there in the late afternoon, hang around till evening and there is a light sound in the open area which is simply beautiful."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,A tropical wonderland of colourful flora in an architectural masterpiece. An educational and enthralling experience for those of all ages.
,,Don't miss the cloud forest!,5.0,,"Have been to Gardens by the bay several times before, but always thought the 'domes' would be too hot in the already high Singapore temperatures. However, it is cool, and refreshing to be near the waterfalls. The inside space is much bigger than it appears on the outside. Fantastic place to spend some time. The whole concept and design is amazing. Only wished I'd visited sooner!"
,,Into Horticulture? Then a must see.,5.0,,"Plant life from different parts of the world. Waterfalls. Mist to replicate mountainous region. Even if you're not that into horticulture, it's covered and air conditioned. Good escape from the heat. I spent 3.5 hours here. Felt like 1"
,,Very special experience,4.0,,"This was very confronting and interesting, really opened our eyes to what we are doing to our plant and our forests. A beautiful experience thank you"
,,Cool place on a hot day,5.0,,"This is part of gardens by the bay. There is an entry fee for this as well as the flower dome, but both are worth it. As others have said, if you do not like heights then the walkways will not be for you. You can still see some things from the ground or more stable footing, but there is a high walkway that might be fun for some. I personally do not enjoy heights, but this was so fun and beautiful that I did not mind. Well, I did mind, but the views outweigh the unfounded fear."
,,Just wow... Amazing man made beauty,5.0,,Grown up daughter traveling with parents... Was amaze how everything was so amazingly done and looks so good... Forest brought into the city to be experience...
,,Amazing - 25'c inside all year round - do during the day,5.0,,"You might be tempted to visit the Cloud Forest in the evening, thinking you'll see the Supertree grove light show straight after, but remember, this dome is designed to let maximum sunlight in, so at night, although strategically lit, you won't see the full magnificence.

The dome can be visited with the flower dome for SG$28 for tourists (SG$20 for locals) and you can grab a re-entry stamp at the end so you can visit as many times as you like during the day. Last admission is at 8:30pm so keep that in mind.

The best parts about the Cloud Forest is that it has an amazing 'canopy walk' from which you can view the spectacular plants and scenery from up high.The waterfall inside is beautiful, and a tunny underneath links it to the Flower Dome.

Great for kids, adults, and seniors."
,,Stunning place - the best in Singapore!,5.0,,"This place is truly spectacular & just amazes you what they can do.

From the huge indoor waterfalls to the wealth of flora and fauna it's truly a spectacular place to visit!

Takes a bit of walking make sure you have at least some fitness.... but I would recommend it to anyone."
,,Waterfall is mesmerizing,4.0,,Beautiful cool and nice place To have a walk with your partner hand in hand it's a beautiful place to visit. Being inside even if outside is hot it will be pleasant inside. It was gr8
,,Just Gorgeous! Very well done!,5.0,,"We walked into the Dome at about 5.30pm, sun still shining. As we walked through it gradually got darker, until we were standing in the Dome looking out at the city underlights.

From the moment you walk in, you just say Wow! You follow the pathway around and up, and its been beautifully put together.

We visited here as part of our Singapore Pass we purchased, so not sure on the exact cost.

It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience."
,,Nice but not suitable for those who afraid of height,4.0,,"As visitors need to walk along the high ""mountain"", those who are afraid of height might need to think twice. It is very cold inside here."
,,Worth seeing,4.0,,"This was recommended to us by our friends to see rather than the Flower Dome. I guess it depends on what you're in to. This was fabulous, but a bit expensive for a family of 5 (about SG$65 and we were in there for about 30 minutes)."
,,Amazing cloud forest inside a dome,5.0,,"This is a must see - fun, educational and amazing all at once.
As you go higher, the plants change and it tells you about the conditions and what can exist. It also tells you about climate change and how this is impacting the plants, tree and wildlife at each level.
Fabulous place to visit in the Gardens by the Bay. See also the flower dome next to this."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"Visit this for sure, it's a must see attraction which is absolutely beautiful and unique. The misting times are quite frequent and the surroundings are fantastic and educational"
,,Gorgeous and Beautiful,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is amazing and beautiful. It is filled with gorgeous plants and flowers (many orchids) plus an amazing waterfall. It was very pleasant on a hot humid day because it is lovely and cool inside the cloud forest.
,,Absolutely a must,5.0,,"You have to visit this place when you are in Singapore. It's beautiful, but don't take my words for it. Go see it yourself."
,,A must visit when you are at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"If you happened to be checking out garden by the bay, be sure to check out this mega dome as well. you might wanna check out the other mega dome, the flower dome too if you have time to do so. personally i prefer the cloud forest to the flower dome.

highly recommended!"
,,The best biome,5.0,,"If you only have time to visit one of the glass biomes, I'd personally recommend this one. On entry you see the impressive waterfall that cascades off the central structure and you can spend the next hour or so walking around both inside and outside the waterfall seeing the various flora typical of a cloud forest. Very informative and good for kids, I really enjoyed my time here."
,,cool,5.0,,the waterfall and the whole experience of the dome was really nice. getting up with a pushchair is possible but the queue for the lift was somewhat long.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,This is a must before you visit the Laser light show. Catch the lift up and walk down the circular walking area and see all the amazing plants and wonder how they got them there.
,,Excellent Creation,5.0,,"This is one of the Dooms in the Garden By the Bay, charged but every dollar is worth it. The atmhosphere is excellent. Stronly recommend to see the man made forest"
,,Chilly!,4.0,,"During sweltering days,its an awesome place.Otherwise you will freeze but the flowers are nice.Overall is nice."
,,"""Amazing""",4.0,,"You must see this wonderful place, it is so amazing, has the most beautiful waterfall , mist and the plants are just beautiful, you have to see it to believe how amazing it is."
,,You will love it!,5.0,,"The cloud forest is one of Singapore must see. It is an impressive engineering masterpiece. Special designed glas, exoscelet,and a 60 meters indoor waterfall is just the start. Ant then there is all the plants... WOW! Cant wait to go back!"
,,A Must See - stunning and educational,5.0,,"A truly beautiful and magical place. All the plant life and the way they have this set up is amazing and to learn about our ecosystem in an easy and enjoyable way is fabulous. It is so well kept, lovely to walk around, lots of information boards to read and beautiful carvings too."
,,Excellent,4.0,,As you would expect it was crowded but that wasn't a problem as the crowds flowed well. The forest was an amazing sight to see with the water flows and plants.
,,Clouds of Glory,5.0,,"Futuristic, beautiful, amazing place. You walk in a spiral and go up and up to view the different plants and blooms. You can even walk behind the waterfall. It is interesting to see how it is all done! Love this place! Just be prepared to walk a bit."
,,Must see,5.0,,"While I was less impressed by the other paid options in the Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud forest was a worthwhile experience. Amazing ambiance."
,,incredible and awesome,5.0,,"Cloud dome is worth a visit....even if you do not have a lot of time, do check this out. The waterfall and the rainforest environment is exciting to explore... the mist all around will leave you with a wonderful and refreshing feeling... the varied information that you get to absorb is interesting and knowledgeable... very good to bring kids along as it will double up as an educational tour...."
,,A great stop at the Gardens,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is an interesting exhibit to see. You begin at the bottom of a waterfall and then ride an elevator up to the mid section, and take stairs up the rest of the way. The whole place is like a forest with interesting sculptures and artwork hidden among the trees. It's really quite interesting to see! Great place to escape the heat for a bit!"
,,Ok,3.0,,Nice place if you are into your plants. Cool and refreshing place to be when its hot outside. Try and get in when the light show is on. Great view.
,,Cloud Dome,5.0,,"completely man made, huge collections of plants, cacti..various kind of forests. and then come the mist. must watch"
,,You don't have to climb mountains to be on the mountains.,4.0,,There will be cloud mist every 2 hours stating 10am. Very enriching as you will also learn about Earth 5 Degree on a very huge screen.
,,Tests your vertigo :),5.0,,Loved this garden. It combines the beauty of the natural world with a exciting treetop walk. Im not great with heights but very much enjoyed this.
,,its a must see,5.0,,"we spent many hours here its a wonderful experience with so much to see, very helpful staff and excellent exhibits, and the clime to the top wow, that was great its a must see and do, we went by open top bus where you can hop on and off at many places all over the city. its a must do."
,,go during misting times,5.0,,We went at 6 pm and then again at 7:30 PM when it was lighted. Remember to get the re-entry sticker at the exit to be able to enter again.
,,Cloud dome,4.0,,Just love this place. Got gd package deal. Awesome!!! Kids were fascinated about bridge. A little scary going up so high. Everyone was thrilled. Will visit again if not again and again!
,,Spectacular conservatory,5.0,,"This is an amazing feat of planning, architecture, engineering, conservation and environmental sustainability. A credit to all those involved in its design and execution. It doesn't matter if you have green thumbs or not, this is a wonderful and special place to be."
,,#1 attraction in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"If there is one thing you do within the Gardens by the Bay park, choose Cloud Forest. It is by far the stand out. The man-made structure provides photo opportunities everywhere. The dome is climate controlled, so it provides a welcome relief from outside humidity. When you enter the dome you are greeted by a towering waterfall that cascades from the top of the mountain. You walk around the base of the mountain until you reach the first entry point of the mountain. There is the lift to the top of the structure, so this is an activity that elderly and less mobile can do. From the top, you walk out on fixed metal walkways that wrap around mountain and take you back in and out as you descend down. Within the base of the mountain there is a short video presentation of causes and effects of global warming on subtropical areas.
How much time you spend within the dome is up to you, it really depends on how much you like taking pictures. Its not an attraction to be rushed, there's more to see than you expect."
,,Great skywalk,5.0,,Really good the skywalk gave a great view and its very well maintained. The waterfall is really huge. Worth a visit.
,,Just a wonderful experience,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is amazing. The concept is absolutely incredible. On entering this dome you are transported to another world of beauty. The variety of plants are magnificent. The waterfall is unbelievable. This must be on everyone's list of things to do in Singapore. Easy to get to by train.
,,Amazing,4.0,,Amazing set up - great way to cool down and get away from the Singapore heat while still touring. Great concept and experience.
,,Interesting Garden Setup and Remember to do the Cloud Walk!,4.0,,"This conservatory is located side by side with the Flower Dome within the Garden by the Bay.

You're first greeted with a great waterfall as you walked through the entrance. Misting will be featured every 2 hours throughout the day.

As you work your way up the forest, you'll get to appreciate some facts about different plants which are found at different heights of a mountain around the world.

There's a Cloud Walk which is left overhanging the top of the forest that tests your bravery with heights and also a slightly 'lower' Treetop Walk to appreciate another perspective of the forest.

I think the attraction is worth a visit at least once when in Singapore."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"While in Singapore, there are a couple of places that are almost mandatory. The Marina Bay Sands Bar (KudaTe) in the upper level, the Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest. It has the biggest indoors water fall of the world and it's a nice walk throughout the different plant species available. Interesting walk in an interesting part of Singapore"
,,Spectacular Views,5.0,,Plenty to see and some spectacular views. We combined our visit with entry to the Flower Garden as well which will cost you $30 for both but it's well worth it if you're a tourist.
,,amazing,5.0,,"This is a must see! such a beautiful experience, everyone needs to see this, and its even better at night."
,,Nice Man Made Forest,5.0,,"This i am sure would appeal to all ages, a bit of easy walking involved, but it is quite cool inside the cloud forest dome, with 5-story waterfall. 7-story tower. Epiphytes everywhere. Climate controlled and misty.Allow yourself plenty of time to look and see."
,,Not just for plant nuts,4.0,,"We purchased tickets at the Chinatown Visitors Centre as they were cheaper. S$25 per adult gets you entry into both domes (Flower Dome is the other) right next to each other.
You catch a lift up the middle of the mountain which has a waterfall all down one side of 35m. You then walk down walkways which wind around the mountain, in and out and even jut out. The view outside the dome from the walkways is also amazing. The whole mountain is just covered in all types of greenery and flowers. Everything about it was just beautiful. Nice and cool inside too!"
,,chilling out in the mist,5.0,,"This is my 4th trip in to the cloud forest, Gardens by the Bay is such a wonderful display of incredible plants in their true situations. I love the peace and the sound of the mist and water making it a peaceful place to anchor yourself."
,,Amazing. Must See.,5.0,,"You've got to go, buy a ticket to both the cloud and the flower dome, it's so worth it. Afterwards, head up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands SkyBar and have a cocktail. The views are as exceptional as the Sky Deck one level lower and you don't have to pay for entry..."
,,This place made me realize,3.0,,"This place made me realize how lucky I am to live in the Philippines. We might not have all the modern technologies that SG has but we don't have to create a man-made air-conditioned rain forest/cloud forest. Don't get me wrong the place is nice, but it's made of steel and they are using air-conditioners to cool the place which I guess, making SG even hotter."
,,The waterfall is fantastic,5.0,,The waterfall is spectacular. Make sure you walk all the way to the top and then walk back along the tree top walk (but only if you are ok with heights)
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Get the MRT to Bayfront, walk across the little bridge and get the shuttle to the Cloud Forest. A combined ticket for the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome costs $28. The architecture and display of the exotic plants is spectacular. Even if you are not a keen gardener the Cloud Forest is well worth seeing."
,,"A must, it's fascinating.",5.0,,Definitely worth the visit. We spent about 30mins wandering through. A really unique experience even if your not into plants.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Very well thought out. Its beautifully done. Would definitely recommend it for families. Fun for the kids.
,,A relaxing atmosphere,4.0,,"Visit the cloud forest and enjoy the different plant varieties. Don't miss walking the trail in the clouds. Great views. Go at misting time, which seems to be every two hours. Catch the shuttle bus if you don't want to walk to the dome."
,,Impressive,5.0,,I was so impressed with these gardens. It is amazing. So well designed and charming I took so many photos. Another must do.
,,Nicely done,5.0,,Easy to spend several hours wandering the gardens and then walking the suspension bridge up in the trees. Good views of the city and Marina sands area. Great diversion from all the shopping malls in town
,,"Out of the 2 'greenhouses', this is the better one",4.0,,"This zone has a great waterfall as you enter which is very impressive. The whole zone is basically a walkway, you start at the top and walk your way down, very good"
,,Stunning,5.0,,More vertical gardens than you will ever see again. The walk around the waterfall tower spectacular.
,,It is like you are flying in a Botanical Space Ship,5.0,,Cloud Forest was clearly meant to be a precursor to the eventual super space colony ships that we will all have to use sometime this century as we pollute the Earth to the point of inhospitability. Cloud Forest is here to prepare you for it.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,This is for sure a must in Singapore! Wonderful context and beautiful scenery makes this living museum very unique.
,,Best place I ever been in Asia specially Singapore in hot weather and so humid.,5.0,,"It is best place to be, we went to flower dome at first and I thought was fantastic love it and continue our trip to cloud Forest that even more amazing, we bought $28 ( in 2014) for both places and I think was pretty cheap compared with what the experience and place such as amazing for both. LOVE IT. I recommend for everyone to come and see. I felt like i want to sleep and don't want to leave these place. I wanted to stay there forever LOL."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,We really enjoy. If u go to gardens by the bay then u must try it. They really make could Forest something different. For first timers u really enjoy it. If I was not in could Forest I definitely miss something. Worth it if u can.
,,Different dimension,5.0,,"I felt like walking through a real rain forest, loved the feeling it gives from the moment we step in. From the waterfall attraction till you step out, you feel like you are in a different world, you guys are the best"
,,Nice cooling place with loads of greenery,4.0,,"The conservatory is cooled and so it was a great place to be in during the hot afternoon. Inside, is a man made waterfall and loads of little canopy you can walk on. The air inside is really great, it's really like being in a jungle.
We spent about 1.5 hours wandering inside the cloud forest.
They have benches and Toilets inside so not to worry. you can also exit and re enter again as Long as it is within the same day."
,,If you are choosing between this and the Flower dome,5.0,,"the Cloud forest is better. More to see and do. Also, do check the website as both undergo maintenance you might find one or the other is closed."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Well worth the visit but be prepared for the sky walk in case you are afraid of heights. An environmental educational experience re climate change and global warming. But the Crystal Cave with stalagmites had no explanation of where they came from. Hopefully no geological structures were vandalized to display them.
,,Must See,5.0,,A must for anybody visiting Singapore. A magnificent example of flora conservation. Visit Cloud Forest and Flora
,,A must see and do.,5.0,,"The Cloud Garden is part of the Gardens by the Bay, and cost $$ to get in( cant remember how much) but if you buy the ticked from the from gate you can get all the gardens and bus shuttle for $28, good value.
The gardens has some beautiful flowers and waterfalls and a must to walk around. it is an indoor garden, sheltered from the outside."
,,"Great spot for a rain day, or any other day for that matter",5.0,,"Get a ticket for both places but do the flower dome first. It can feel cold to some people so if you feel the cold take a light jersey or top stay warm, make sure you have a camera, lots of photo opportunities for close-up flower shots and also outside scenery shots. Take your time, a couple of hours is fine unless you are a keen photographer. Wheelchair friendly, a taxi was the easy option for getting there."
,,Amazing mountain of orchids and greenery,5.0,,Beautiful gardens that are under a covered dome. You wander slowly up a path that takes you to different types of plants and areas to explore the canopy…. like being in another world.
,,Orchid dome,5.0,,"This environmental dome showcases flora from cloud forests where many of the thousands of varieties of orchids grow. A waterfall tumbles from the top level of the dome, turning to mist before the lower level. Do expect to get damp, but it is refreshing after the Singapore heat. The path winds its' way up through an artificial mountain to the top where there is a pool surrounded by exotic flowers and back down past walls of plants. There is a showcase of some of the rare tiny varieties of orchid and another of cave formations. A theater plays a film of environmental message.
This dome would be a great escape from the heat or rain. It takes a while to see and there is some steep climbing involved. There is an elevator if required. The gardens are free, but this dome and the Flower dome require admission. You can purchase together but if you ask you can get a single dome admission."
,,Best part of garden in Singapore .,5.0,,"Cloud forest is completely different from other gardens. Firstly in entrance see waterfall. Capture all movement in camera. Then take a lift,go to top part of forest,come down By walkway,An experience personally. Must watch this ,"
,,Fantastical,5.0,,"It's like someone had captured a fairy tale setting into a modern-day glass bottle! The gardens and water feature at the top of the ""cloud"" are beautiful, and the walk down the ramps (with see through floor grilles along the sides of the ramp) is a heady experience. There is a stalagmite and stalactite display along the way to play further into the fairy tale grotto theme, but I wish there was more information on display on the origins of these stones."
,,Great,5.0,,"Spent a few hours walking around the gardens great waterfall well worth the visit , not for the ones who are scared of heights"
,,Autumn Lantern Festival,5.0,,An excellent place to be in when it's hot and humid outside. Chilled moisture pervades the huge dome that houses many plants in an ideal environment . Spend an hot day there or a cool evening and I truly enjoyed the visit.
,,Green in the City,5.0,,Lovely walks around the Cloud Forest. Cool and green. Very busy though but doesn't detract. Nice to get out of the humidity and worth a visit.
,,day trip,5.0,,"The best in the world. A must for all tourists. However, needs patience and time to explore the entire place."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Situated within the gardens by the bay, and a really stunning and cool respite from the heat and humidity. Very well planned and views out from the top are fabulous"
,,Most beautiful place!,5.0,,"A cool and refreshing break from the humidity, the cloud dome is incredibly beautiful and surreal-feeling, like being in a video game platformer with spectacular flowers. We enjoyed seeing lots of mountaintop plants we wouldn't have had the opportunity to otherwise."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"I was reluctant at first but I'm sure glad I went! The layout, waterfall, view, and art pieces all combined to make this an excellent 2 hours. It was great to spend the day there before starting night activities for the GP."
,,Our favourite of the 2 domes,5.0,,Fresh air and ambience welcome you at the entrance of this dome and you have a feeling of not wanting to leave. The magnitude of this manmade forest is simply magnificient. The price you pay for the entrance fee is worth it. Do come and spend 1-2hours here and you will leave feeling very refreshed.
,,Modern beauty,4.0,,"I like being in natural environments, & this feels like an oasis of nature in the heart of an urban metropolis."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Worth the visit although expensive to enter, but everything is in Singapore! Do it latter in the day when it's hot so you can cool off."
,,In the clouds.,5.0,,The cloud forest comes in the same ticket as the flower domes. It has a beautiful waterfall at the entrance is quite cold inside. The dome has a lift to go up and there's a walk way to come down seeing different plants and trees. The preservation again is praise worthy as some of the plants won't even survive in the Singapore climate.
,,Outstanding Worldly Architectural and Indoor Gardens Achievement!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore and I highly recommend that your should definitely make a visit to this incredible place! The building structure is absolutely magnificent and enormous in scale. The waterfall is deemed the world's largest interior waterfall of its kind. There are multiple levels and a fantastic walkway suspended from the central mountain, forested with exotic plants. As you cross the meandering walkway, you will have many great views through the glass windows to the Marina Sands area as well. Definitely one of my best travel experiences!"
,,Good,3.0,,Nothing that you cannot miss. It is a good experience for just once. Will not want to go again and again.
,,STUNNING STRUCURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"What an imposing structure with waterfalls & steam coming from a myriiad of pipes to represent the clouds.The views from the top are magnificent but I found the walkways a little scary
as you could see through the floor griddles & so not recommended for people who do not like heights."
,,A World of Beauty,5.0,,"GARDENS BY THE BAY - PART TWO
CLOUD FOREST

Welcome to part two of my visit to ‘Gardens By The Bay’.

Upon exiting The Flower Dome, the entrance to Cloud Forest is but a short distance away. Staff manning the turnstiles will request the remainder of your ticket.

Once inside, the atmosphere suddenly turns cool and idyllic, as once sees a gigantic man made waterfall tumbling down to one’s right, which is truly a feast for the eyes.

Photos taken, one makes their way up a slight ramp within Cloud Forest. Escalators and elevators are available should one wish to take advantage of them, to reach the ‘summit’. On the way down, there are a series of walkways that encircle the magnificence of this breathtaking attraction, which is housed within a massive greenhouse.

Descending escalators within the 'forest' allow one to enjoy further interesting attractions, with exits onto the descending exterior walkway. A photographic must is 'capturing' the outside world through foliage encircled openings from within the forest.

Please take note of the attached photos, as I am sure they will whet one’s appetite."
,,A must see ...,5.0,,"Take the lift to the top and slowly make your way down the ramps for an interesting walk through a tropical mountain complete with waterfall - it's very cool! Very informative displays along the way.
If you're also planning to go to the Flower Dome there's a discount for buying both tickets together.
We travelled on Scoot and were given another S$3 discount for showing our boarding pass or eticket."
,,OK if you have nothing else going on,3.0,,"Not a bad place to visit to escape the heat and haze. It's not the most exciting place, but it certainly is unique"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Under cover, so viewable in any weather, this is a wonderful display. From the fabulous waterfall which falls from the top of the done to the bottom you wander up a path to the summit, viewing an amazing selection of flowers, plants, shrubs and foliage. Terrific views from the top. There is a lift if needed."
,,MUST SEE!!,5.0,,"This was my favorite part of the trip. The waterfall, the trees, the flowers, just breathtaking! I highly recommend it!"
,,Pleasing to the eye,4.0,,Simply the best place to bring friends or relatives who is visiting Singapore to show them a truly garden city. thumbs up.
,,The most amazing garden design for all,5.0,,"This was without doubt the best garden I've ever seen in a dome. Cascading waterfalls, walkways where you can spot pitcher plants and orchids. A cool environment where every so often jets of steam cloud the entire dome and everywhere drips. Fantastic!"
,,Indoor Mountain with Waterfall - must visit,5.0,,The humidity in here is pretty high but well worth seeing. The mountain is covered with plants and the waterfall is about 15m high - it's incredible. Best to see this forest during the day time because you need to see all the flowing and rare plants and the photos are stunning.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The rain forest is amazing. Look out for the carvings very clever. lovely flowers and waterfalls. does get chilly. great view from the top.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,The waterfall is the largest indoor waterfall in the world and it is truly amazing. Get tickets to both domes and spend some time away out from the heat of the Gardens.
,,Don't Miss it,5.0,,"If you want to get some relief from the Singapore humidity, visit the Cloud Forest at the Gardens by the Bay. This is a fantastic experience with many many plants, shrubs and trees from all over the world. The waterfalls and high level walkways are an amazing experience and one that shouldn't be missed when visiting Singapore. Try to visit late afternoon as the free evening light show is beautiful and amazing."
,,"Nice exhibit, nothing special",3.0,,"Impressive construction in architectural sense, but contents perhaps a bit boring to an average non-botanic-enthusiast. Artifical waterfall, many plants (labeled), dimmed lighting in the evening, few educational segments (for kids or those generally uninformed of enviromental issues). Not to expensive, so might be a nice round-up to gardens by the bay, but better to try and get some real open-air jungle if you can (and Singapore has plenty)."
,,Can't miss,5.0,,"This is a great attraction, 10 minutes walk away from all the hustle of the city in the Gardens by the bay. The waterfall is the first thing you see and it is quite amazing. The suspended walkways inside giving a birds eye view, walking behind the waterfall and misting of the plants all add to the splendour of this attraction. It has been well planned and is part educational, in its awareness of global warming and deforestation, but not to the point of overkill of these topics."
,,Stroll in the morning,5.0,,"My good friend and I decided to take a stroll at Gardens by the Bay as it was a holiday. She had never visited the Gardens before so I had to show her my favourite part - the Cloud Forest.
The waterfall that greeted us is so cool and inviting, I really enjoyed feeling the misty spray on our faces. The flowers and ferns were so green, cool and calming.... I loved the walk along the bridge as well even though it might be a little challenging for those who are afraid of heights. I will definitely recommend the Cloud Forest to all visitors as I think it's the most unique part of Gardens by the Bay."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"There is a cost to get into the cloud forest but it is worth it. This i am sure would appeal to all ages, a bit of easy walking involved, but it is quite cool inside the cloud forest dome.. The plants and greenery are amazing. Allow yourself plenty of time to look and see."
,,Wonderful garden,5.0,,"It's really clouded forest, cooling and with lots of plant and flowers from the temperate country, preferably take a lift to the TOP and a slow Walk down ."
,,My Most Favorite Place in Singapore,5.0,,5-story waterfall. 7-story tower. Epiphytes everywhere. Climate controlled and misty. This is my not-so-secret spot to visit when the heat and humidity drive me crazy. Be sure to take a camera and even take pictures of things inside and outside of the dome.
,,Fantastic Man Made Cloud Forest,4.0,,"The Falls catched my attention and it took me a while to move and go further inside. You dont wanna miss the mist here are the timings 10:00am, 12:00pm, 2:00pm 4:00pm, 6.00pm, 8.00pm daily. Perfect for Family, Friends and couples"
,,Hidden Surprises,5.0,,"If you love being in nature, you will love this place. The Cloud Forest is an incredible blend of foliage, sounds and sculpture. Whoever designed this had a huge imagination. Expect the unexpected: an incredibly high indoor waterfall, Lego plants amongst the real ones, peaceful ponds and cool mist. Go when it opens in the morning. The atmosphere is at its best with few people inside. You can almost believe you are trekking through the jungle. Look carefully for the 'hidden' sculptures and enjoy the city views through the glass dome.

Don't be put off by friends who think it will be boring walking around a dome and just looking at a garden that you can't 'get amongst'. We weren't, and we just loved it on so many levels. There are plenty of other outdoor gardens (free) to walk around here if you'd rather stay in the steamy outdoors and sun, as the temperature does drop considerably when you enter the forest dome. For my money, that was an added bonus!"
,,a breath of fresh air!,5.0,,"Cool dome and cooling temperature. You get to the elevator up to the top and walk the elevated walkway and slowly make your way down while enjoying the soothing atmosphere, the view, and the plants. Great for family and friends!"
,,"Nice, but still meh",4.0,,"This is a nice place to visit, don't get me wrong. But I was done with the place in about 25 mins, and still felt a bit underwhelmed, esp. after reading all the reviews. The temperature in here was definitely a welcome change from the humidity outside. It's probably a lot more fun if you have kids, since they'd be fascinated by the totem poles, waterfalls and trees. Not something I'd say you skip, but don't build up the expectations in your head."
,,First time to Cloud Forest,5.0,,I was there when they first built it but we running out time to actually went in. Early this year Jan 2016 i was there and great walk to the top. Will be going here again late December this year 2016. Highly recommended .
,,Out-of-this-world experience,5.0,,"Thoroughly amazed by the conceptualization and design of this science-fiction style domed Cloud Forest, and the way this is so well-engineered and maintained. Think about it, this is on a land which was once the sea. This is providing a cool temperature on such a large scale in very hot Singapore. Would recommend going at least twice -- once during a sunny day, once from sunset till the night. I took my time unhurriedly and soaked in the ambience, it's out-of-this-world."
,,Like stepping into a freeze frame of Avatar,4.0,,"Especially so when you get there just in time to watch the clouds form, it's quite a spectacular sight, you don't actually have to travel to the Amazons to get a piece of exotic rainforest. For something quite entirely man-made, this place is absolutely breath-taking - everything is where it should be, as how it should look like if you were in a rainforest; probably even better than a rainforest since they've squeezed everything into that one space."
,,very interesting place. Cant miss while in Singapore,5.0,,"Very nice place, cloud forest reproduced in a Dome! you can visit garden by the bay and this place at the same day! dont miss!"
,,Thumbs up for Gardens by the Bay with kids,5.0,,"Went with my four year old boy and six month old baby. Go In the morning as the crowd is manageable. We loved the cloud forest. It was so cool.. Literally and the mist sprays were great fun. Remember to bring a wind breaker!

We also went to the water playground where my Son splashed around in his undies coz we didn't bring any swim outfit.

If u are hungry walk down towards satay by the Bay, there's local cuisine at affordable prices"
,,Amazing man made wonder clothed in nature,5.0,,"I visited Cloud Forest twice August 2016. Once with friends at a conference and once with my husband. It was just as amazing each time. The first visit was in the evening and there were lots of people there - a little crowded but not overly so. The second visit was in the morning. The Cloud Forest was much quieter and I think more enjoyable. Be ready to take lots of photos. It easy to get to using the MRT, bus or taxi. While you are there see the Flower dome and the Skyway as well. There are lots of themed gardens to walk through as well as eating places etc."
,,Air conditioning,5.0,,"I think if you purchase the combo tickets, it would be more worth the money as you get to go to both the cloud and flower dome. I think it's excellent particularly because of the air conditioning and after a long walk or cycle around gardens by the bay, it's extremely cooling. Overall, they do have beautiful exhibitions and I think it's definitely worth a visit at least once if you do visit gardens by the bay. It's great for friends and families!"
,,Cool in the midst of humid Singapore,4.0,,"I love the cloud forest as it provided a respite from the heat and humidity. Loved the nice walk with beautiful flowers and greens and the waterfall! It is man-made but still one of the highlights in Singapore.

There's also a light show every hour during the evenings in the outdoor area of Gardens By the Bay and also the view of the Gardens from MBS is amazing."
,,Unusual Experience,4.0,,a beautiful setting with lots of amazing plants. The atmosphere in the Cloud Forest was serene & peaceful
,,Must go !!,5.0,,"I had a day to kill on a business trip in Singapore. What should I do and all I was told was the gardens by the bay.
They are stunning but as their centre piece is the cloud forest an amazing feat of architecture that houses tower of cloud forest !!! Walk through it, over it, under it but wherever you are, be prepared to be dazzled. I am fairly well travelled but I have never experienced anything like it.
Also make sure you get your hand stamped which allows re entry.. Go in the morning then in the evening when it is all lit up amazing.
Just go !!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,It was boiling hot outside and so cool and lovely inside. Well worth the money. There is a huge waterfall inside which is amazing.
,,Extraordinary.,5.0,,"one of the best parts to visit within Gardens by the bay, the diversity of plants and the amazing techniques used to place all of them is astounding. The input of elevators was an excellent idea."
,,Thing of Beauty,5.0,,"What can I say after every praise has been mentioned about the place?

If you are visiting Singapore for the very first time, make sure that this is on top of itinerary list. It is something like you have ever seen before and the duration is really worth it.

A man made forest that is a must for every nature lover to visit."
,,Very nice indoor terrarium - gives other biosphere's a run for their money,4.0,,"This was truly an interesting place but primarily for the water fall. You are expected to walk along a path, with a slight incline at times, and escalators down at other times. The waterfall is the first thing you experience and it is quite impressive. You do see the fall from other sides as you proceed the trip. This is at the heart of it a botanical garden and it does an excellent job of highlighting the diversity of plants around. There is one part of the exhibit dedicated to stalactites, stalagmites, and geodesic stones which are quite impressive. The final stop is the museum shop (don't they all). Given that the entire place is enclosed in a dome is also quite impressive."
,,Beautiful corner of Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing flowers and plants laid out in a natural and beautiful way. The full height waterfalls give the whole dome an amazing atmosphere, and the dome provides quite a refreshing respite from the heat of midday in Singapore."
,,An amazing piece of engineering,5.0,,"The cloud forest is an amazing, self contained ecosystem in air conditioned comfort. There are a few different gardens and other displays to look at, as well as escalators and elevators to get between the various floors.

Well worth the entry fee, which should also provide access to the flower dome as well."
,,Company director,5.0,,"We revisited the forest since in first opened and it is now simply outstanding and easy to get around.
Stunning variety of plants mixed in with hidden wooden sculptures.
Even if you are not so into plants it's just worth a couple of hours to have a look and a stroll around"
,,amazing,5.0,,i can look at amazing waterfall inside of a building!!!! one of place you must to go in singapore!!!!
,,Wow,5.0,,"With every step in this amazing place, my breath was taking away! Day or night,,,,, the experience is FANTASTIC. We went at night and or mates went during the day and we discussed how different the experience was and must go back to witness the opposite of what we did on this trip."
,,Unique heat escapre,5.0,,"Ive never seen anything like it. My dogs were barking so I sat at the base of the waterfall for a long while cooling off watching all kinds of nationalities take there pictures in front of the waterfall. This alone was highly entertaining but then the hike through the waterfall is breathtaking. This is not for those afraid of heights, there is a walkway that left my wife's knees buckling a little, but she doesnt like heights. I loved it, and its a great place to see something unique and be in air conditioning for a spell. There are a zillion things to do around here as well, so plan on using a day in the gardens."
,,Beautiful waterfall,5.0,,Massive waterfall on entry. Beautiful experience walking the millions of plants and structures. Beautiful scenery as you walk through the levels.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"So beautiful , walked along way from the top to bottom, such a unique place you need to go here and enjoy."
,,Simply awesome,5.0,,"I was expecting big things with this exhibit, I wasn't let down. Simply the most amazing attraction at the gardens. Beautiful plants, flowers and trees. A fantastic walkway at the top and around the tree tops. The first steps on the walkway at the top are daunting if you have a fear of heights but then just look around you and see the brilliant views. Bring your camera, don't run and spend an hour or two inside."
,,Spectacular Mountain Flora,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is one of two huge biodomes in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay.

It is an eight-stores high glass greenhouse maintained at a constant temperature and humidity to simulate the ideal conditions for mountain top flora to flourish.

You catch a lift to the top them walk down a spiraling ramp, through various levels of mountain trees, bushes, shrubs, plants, flowers, ferns and mosses.

Big waterfalls add to the visual effect and also hel to maintain humidity levels.

A double ticket giving admission to both biodomes - the other is the Flower Dome - is S$33 for foreigners."
,,Must-do attraction,5.0,,"There are plenty of reviews here detailing what is on offer at the cloud forest, so I won't repeat those. Suffice to say this really is a must-do when you visit Singapore, I certainly haven't experienced anything quite like it before. The mass foliage and plantings are impressive and I lost count of the number of variations on beautiful orchids; from tiny flowers just a few mm across to boldly coloured larger flowers. A slow walk around is a lovely way to spend around an hour. Also nice to see some great nikau specimens to remind us of home (NZ)."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Not too expensive to go in but is definitely worth every penny. Stunning plants and waterfalls, built if different levels so you get to see it up close and from all different angles. The array of plants is something to wonder at. A great way to spend an afternoon"
,,"Must see ,",5.0,,"This is my third visit to cloud forest and I love it, there is something new each time, this time it's the Lego flowers,great place to cool off air conditioned comfort,."
,,It is spectacular ...,5.0,,"Despite previous visits to Gardens by the Bay, I'd not previously ventured into Cloud Forest. First impressions were the amazing interior size and the squillions of ferns, orchids, bromeliads, begonias, mosses and lichens and every other type of plant that lives in the cool tropics or high above in the clouds.
It's the sort of place to easily spend half a day or if pressed for time probably 2 hours would get it done.
Highly recommended and not something that can be seen or enjoyed on this scale anywhere else in the world (that I'm aware of)."
,,Impressive Garden and a Cool Way to Spend an Afternoon in Singapore,5.0,,"I visited the Cloud Forest inside the Gardens by the Bay for an afternoon in Singapore. The place was very cool. They mist the dome every few hours, so bring a jacket or store your electronics in a bag when this happens. To experience the full grandness of the place, take the elevator to the topmost floor then do the Cloud Walk to descend the dome through a metal pathway. Not recommended for those afraid of heights. Be careful also since some areas might be slippery due to the mist."
,,Good,4.0,,"One of the best indoor gardens in the world. Located in Gardens in the Bay of Singapore. Contains a man-made indoor waterfall with climate controlled indoor garden that houses an amazing variety of tropical rain forest trees, ferns and plants."
,,Just.....Amazing....,5.0,,"No words to describe. Other than Incredible. Only a few dollars to get in, the most magnificent skywalk, brilliant photo opportunities, cool, atmospheric, brilliant staff.....just go!!!"
,,Great attraction!,5.0,,"A beautiful place much different from the flower dome located a few steps away. A ticket combining both activities can be bought for 28 SIN$/adult.

The temperature of the dome is regulated which makes is a perfect place to visit if it rains or when the temperature is very hot.

You'll be able to see a huge artificial cascade and many varieties of plants. A path allows you to see the structure from the bottom to the top and enjoy the different expositions along the way.a great experience I strongly recommend if you're around Singapore."
,,Day visit,5.0,,Beautiful place really different and plenty of staff looking after the gardens nice leisurely walk worth going to the top even if you don't like heights
,,Well worth the visit as a family with young kids.,5.0,,Went to Gardens by the Bay and into the Flower Dome first. The kids loved looking for the wooden sculptures and thought it was nice to see. We then went into the Cloud Forest which was an amazing place for all of us and we spent well over an hour walking around with the kids and us engaged in all that it held.
,,Wonder of the world,5.0,,Absolutely stunning and beautiful! I didn't know about cloud forest before and now really want to visit a real one!
,,Excellent Gardens,5.0,,We visited both the Huge Greenhouses they were fantastic especially the platform walk around. A must see
,,NO words to describe,5.0,,"The place is amazing. With indoor waterfalls, cool temperature, some amazing sculptures and fauna and bridge top walk. Make sure you check the spraying time before you arrive. It is very good."
,,Easily the highligh of the Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,"You can't really imagine a better escape from the noon sun on the equator than diving into a gigantic greenhouse simulating life at 1000m in the Borneo Cloud Forest. An enormous waterfall fills the dome with soothing water mist, and trails weave in and out of the mountain offering an easy stroll to the top, with lots of nice little photostops on the way.

You're pretty much guaranteed to exit after an hour or two completely refreshed. If you're in the Gardens, don't miss it."
,,A must see,5.0,,Do yourself a favour and visit this attraction. Absolutely beautiful especially during mist time. This is located right next to the Flower Dome.
,,Cool and refreshing rain forest,5.0,,"This is a lovely part of the Botanic Gardens, which emulates the shape of a mountain with different types of rainforest plants at its levels. You can ascend via elevator or, better yet, a gentle slope suitable for prams and wheelchairs. You do have to pay to get in, but it is worth it. On a hot day, the cool mist is refreshing and the sights of these amazing plants are enthralling. On the top level is a glass dome and small ponds - one of which houses the innocent looking - but carnivorous - pitcher plants. These plants eat flies and other insects by luring them inside the plant with sweet nectar. Lots of places for photo opps with the family - and we found that other visitors were happy to oblige when we asked them to use our camera and take our photo."
,,WOW!!!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore its a must visit. Indoor artificial waterfall but looks very much natural. The atmosphere inside is breathtaking and gives a feeling of an amazon!!. Its stroller friendly and kids will love it.

The location is great, directly accessible from the Marina Bay Sans...Entrance ticket a bit pricey but worth it."
,,This is amazing. Do not miss,5.0,,A must see place when you visit Singapore. The artificial waterfall is really beautiful and there is option to climb till the top. It also includes a wide verity of plants and good for photographs. Better to carry food as the options are limited.
,,Indoor waterfalls,5.0,,"Just like the Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest is a wonderful escape from the hot and humid weather outside in the gardens. You can start your day at the Gardens by the Bay by taking cover at the Cloud Forest where it's always nice and cool. Enjoy the foliage and indoor falls."
,,better than the other one,4.0,,"I liked the park, but Cloud forest seemed to be too crowded and tiny in comparison to park itself astonishing architecture achievement though"
,,Misty,5.0,,Whilst visiting the Cloud Forest and enjoying the view the mist came on and this added to the wonderful exhibition.
,,Rainy Sunday morning,5.0,,"Great place to visit, even out 10 year old was impressed. Take the escalator to the roof of the Marina Bay mall and enjoy the walk to the domes."
,,Omg,5.0,,"You have to pay an entrance fee, but boy is it worth it. From the artificial waterfall to the cloud walk it's all been done to perfection. You've just got to find that money to visit!"
,,Take a walk amongst the clouds,4.0,,"You can view the ""Cloud Forest"" and the nearby ""Flower Dome"" in a package, or you can just visit the""Cloud Forest"". It simulates what you would see in an outdoor cloud forest.

Opening Times: 9am - 9pm
Standard Rate - Two Conservatories (Flower Dome & Clod Forest)
Adults: $28
Child (3-12 years old): $15

Standard Rate - One Conservatory (Cloud Forest)
Adult - $16

Local Singapore residents have a cheaper rate.

On entry you will be in awe by the beauty before you and you will be cooled by the sprays from the crashing waterfall. This is a welcome relief on a hot summers day in Singapore.You can walk around the entire structure and there are great vantage points to secure photo's or stop for a while by a mini lake. There is also a resting space to watch a short documentary about cloud forests and saving our planet. You may ponder over the intricacy of the lego garden!
This experience is a feast for your senses. There are so many vibrant colours, levels of flowers, greenery, vertically and horozontally.

The forest presents you with the feeling as a land lost in time, you may wonder if a dinsoaur will come stomping by.

Note: If you dont like heights, you may not like this experience. You can still enjoy the beauty from ground level. You may like to spend 30 mins to an hour in this experience."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Been there last weekend and I was so amazed. How can they create such a great replica of forest, waterfall and even the fogs felt so real. This is a must place to come in Singapore"
,,AMAZING PLACE,5.0,,ANOTHER FANTASTIC MUST VISIT IN SINGAPORE PLACE. HOW THEY HAVE CREATED THIS WONDERFUL PLACE IS is beyond words to explain. fantastic idea well incorporated. i must visit it whenever i go to Singapore.
,,Awesome trip through the foliage,5.0,,"This is worth the visit, and air conditioned so you can go at any time. I would go early and try to avoid the rush."
,,Truly Amazing - A must do experience,5.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and visited the Cloud Forrest by the bay and it is so lovely just sitting looking at all the plants and flowers, and the waterfall is an experience not to be missed a must do visit, we will def return."
,,The highlight of Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,The Flower Dome is great but we loved the Cloud Forest.....there's just something magical and otherworldly about it. You need to see both....but see the Dome first and visit Cloud Forest next.....it's like the icing on an amazing cake.
,,Spectacular Garden,4.0,,The indoor garden was well-built and it gave visitors the feeling of being in the dense amazon forest with high waterfall and cloudy feeling.
,,Beautiful and educational,5.0,,"After walking the streets of steamy Singapore, visiting the Cloud Forest was a welcome respite. An elevator takes you to the top, and then you ride escalators to lower floors. So it's an easy tour for young and old alike.

Plants are categorized by what grows at different elevations. The exhibit offers some excellent information and data on global warming and its impact on the plant. The plants and sculptures are the main attraction and they don't disappoint!"
,,Great indoor Forest,5.0,,"A little expensive but well worth the walk - thru. Amazing array of tropical plants, be sure to stay for the indoor misting experience."
,,Part of the Gardens by the Bay - Must See,5.0,,After the tropical weather the cool waterfall and forest hit the spot. Well organized flow of visitors and relief from the heat while seeing interesting plants.
,,Amazing plants!,5.0,,Cloud forest is like entering another world . First impression is how cold it is. Unexpected as it looks so lush like a tropical forest. Then is awe at the height of the waterfall. I last visited here several years ago and the plants have matured and filled out considerably. A must visit for anyone interested in plants.
,,Fantastic and Unique,4.0,,"Unique cloud forest at Gardens by the Bay featuring waterfalls and flowers. Is good way to cool down as very cool in there, great views"
,,Nothing special for an above average price,3.0,,"Toured around for not more than 30 mins. Cool inside but quite crowded with all the students doing a field trip. Good for kids but I don't think most adults will enjoy, just got awed upon entrance but once inside there's nothing special."
,,Pretty place,5.0,,"Being a Singaporean myself, I'm really proud of our Gardens by the Bay. The cloud forest and flower dome are way too pretty. What's more, it's air conditioned, definitely a good place to seek some shelter from the hot sun! :)"
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,"Lovely and cool, lifts did not work, only told that we could have climbed lots of stairs to get to the top after we left the venue."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I really like Cloud Forest more than Flower Dome, but i love both. You will feel lil bit fresh after spending your time outside, because the place itself is really cold. Good place to take pictures. My favorite was the waterfall after entering the gate."
,,Domed heaven,4.0,,"A beautiful garden
As you enter a waterfall welcomes you cascading down a mountain
You then walk up around the mountain , lifts are available for those with wheelchairs or strollers
Along the mountain are various plants shrubs flowers beautifully laid out with placards so it makes learning interesting for children too"
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"When you first enter , there's this huge waterfall . The Atmosphere in the dome is nice too. There's air conditioner too. Definitely will visit again"
,,Awesome spectacle,5.0,,"Wow, what a place. Unlike any other place this cloud forest is cooling on a hot day, and enthralling as to how they engineered it all"
,,A must see place.,4.0,,"The sheer size of this Dome become evident as soon as you enter. The noise of the waterfall and the spray capture your attention. When you look up towards the roof you realize that there is a walkway that goes around the Dome and right up to the roof. It is possible to go to the top of the waterfall and look down. A must see place to visit, especially at night. The views through the glass are spectacular as you can see the Marina Sands all lit up."
,,Ok... Not amazing,4.0,,Beautiful but a little overrated. It's a cool place to visit but not a must for me when I go to Singapore.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,Well worth the cost and an interesting experience. Great the way they have created the micro climate in here. Flick the flower dome though and go to the botanical gardens
,,Delightful,5.0,,"What an enjoyable time we had. They turn on the misters, to create the clouds, at different times, but there is a schedule for you to time them. It is very humid but with the a/c it was comfortable."
,,Superbe,5.0,,"The tikets aren't expensive and its a unique experience to walk along the high ramps and feels like we are in the clouds. The waterfall too is pretty awesome, scary from the top."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It was really nice to see that Singapore can have such a nice attraction, it was an eye opening for me when I first step into the Cloud Forest"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"If you have acrophobia then perhaps the Cloud Forest is not a good idea for you. You will be walking on this open-air steel, the walk way is see-through on both sides. However, there is an amazing aerial view of the Dome and down below, which is truly breathtaking! This Cloud Forest conservatory is nearly 1 hectare with huge and stunning waterfall at its entrance embedded with orchids, ferns and other plants that grow in rain forests. A must see for tourist visiting Singapore."
,,An amazing place,5.0,,A visit here is well worth the effort. Of all the botanical type places we have visited thai one stands out as one not to miss. The change in climate from top to bottom is something we have not experienced before in an enclosed structure.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Good price, beautiful place and architecture. So much to see in both of the botanical gardens.Must see."
,,Heavenly experience,5.0,,Very nice and wonderfull place to visit. It's a great achivement on part of Singapore to make something like this. Amazing !!! It's a enclosed mountain in glass cage with AC inside and thousand of plant species plant in unnatural habitat in natural way. Great!!!
,,Feels like heaven,5.0,,Felt as if you are in a rainforest. Beautifull species of flowers and plants. very nicely maintained
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Great climate controlled garden, beatiful displays and so much to see. Great technology behind the scenes."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,Definitely the better of the two conservatories. Much more enjoyable than the flower dome. Exploring the whole thing can take an hour or two and it's very enjoyable.
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,It's man made rain forest and there is man made waterfall. You will feel refreshed as if you were in a forest.
,,Amazing attraction in the city,5.0,,The waterfall is simply spectacular with plants growing on its walls.The views are spectacular from both the inside and outside of the building. Tallest indoor waterfall in the world.
,,Excellent!,5.0,,The cloud forest at Gardens by the Bay was a real highlight of our trip. Truly spectacular and well worth the price of admission. Recommended.
,,Forest in the City,5.0,,I will always bring guests from overseas to the Cloud Forest. The waterfall is simply spectacular with plants growing on its walls. The cool and breezy air is so refreshing. Take a walk round its walking alley to admire the beauty of the whole structure.
,,A must see in the gardens,5.0,,Very very nice. You think you are realy in a rain forest. You can go with the stairs but there is also an elevator because you can go very high up in this place.
,,A great chance to cool down,5.0,,During the heat and humidity in the middle of a Singapore day the cloud forest was a welcome relief from the heat. The views are spectacular from both the inside and outside of the building. Highly recommended if you need to escape the heat.
,,amazing man made feature,4.0,,Just amazed at how they have created such an attractive and functional feature that serves as a tourist attraction.A good relief from the concrete jungle around.
,,Really cool on a hot balmy day,4.0,,Fabulous to get indoors and cool down when the weather is hot and humid outside. The waterfall just inside the door is stunning and the spray really cools you down as you walk past. You have to experience the walkways up so high within the dome for spectacular views. We spent hours in here.
,,Very Nice attraction!,5.0,,"We purchased a ticket online and went to this Cloud Forest, Waterfalls is nice and its cold inside. We enjoyed seeing different kinds of plants. we took some photos of flowers there. Around it is the skywalk to show you around. Perfect for the Family."
,,Wow,5.0,,Spectacular man made wonder. Waterfall is amazing so many photo opportunities . Tallest indoor waterfall in the world.
,,The better of the two paid attractions,5.0,,"Surprisingly good. Amazing engineering and capability. Can get a bit crowded but if you let the rushers rush by you can still steal a quiet moment. Best early before the crowds. Easy access via MRT and short walk, although you can pay for a golf cark ride to the door. Great cycle path up to the display as well. Cute small hot dogs on the lower level.
Fun and easy."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I did this with my family at night time and it was lovely. Take your time to walk through as there is so much to see particularly if you are a plant enthusiast. Lots of little nook and crannies to look at along the walk.
,,Incredible (and a cool relief)!,5.0,,"We loved this place! We were told it would take us 30-45min.. We were in there for a good hour and a half and had to rush out to make the flower dome in time ;) It is so lush and green in there, yes obviously it's not ""real nature"", you are in a human made bubble... But it still impressed us with all the educational/informative signs and areas, the unique plants and setup. Highly recommend! (Also the perfect place to cool down on a hot day!)"
,,CLOUD FOREST,5.0,,We had a fantastic day with part of it being in the Cloud Forest. It would be great for families or individuals
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The is very inexpensive for the Singaporeans, but the price more than doubles for visitors. Lovely selection of plants."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Well worth a visit to the Cloud Forest, especially on a rainy day. The structure itself is impressive, and there are lots of different types of flora and fauna to see."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,Great place to spend some time. As you enter you are greeted with a waterfall. You wander on round the ground floor following the path till you come to some lifts. Take them to the top floor and then work your way down level by level. along suspended footpaths and escalators. It is very well layed out and quite cooling on a hot day.
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,A really cool place to be and you will feel like that you are in the middle of amazon suddenly. Entire family including kids loved it!
,,I loved it!!,5.0,,"I am by profession a gardener, so this was work while on holiday, but boy was it good.
It was just the different varieties and colours, the flowers and smells.
The whole place was tranquil no rush, people all taking time to look around ask questions of the helpful staff.
My teenagers even enjoyed the experience it was kept at a good temperature and took around 1 hour to look around, you could take longer if you wanted.
Even if you are not into plants or gardens it is still worth a look as there are some amazing sculptures and water features to look at.

Top Tip: ask the staff the questions that you may not to do when you are back at home. Pick up I guide book."
,,Woww!! Just woww!!!,5.0,,"This was unbelievable. C'mon!! You can build a rain forest, a mountain and a 10story waterfall all in the same place ??? Make sure you go with fully charged cameras plus back up batteries coz this will need loads. You will go home with loads of pictures and much more beautiful memories. Don't miss this"
,,unbelievable place,5.0,,"it is worth the cost of the entry fee. so colourful, green , immaculate and all with cool temperature control so you can stay all day admiring the works of art only nature can produce and man can show off. loved it"
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"I have travelled many times to Singapore already and I really enjoy the city each time I visit it. This time, I visited the Cloud Forest for the first time, which was a great thing. Loved it what Singapore did here. Absolutely recommend people to go here."
,,Second to the Flower Dome,3.0,,Although it's a good place to visit it comes second to the Flower Dome next door. Also you get held up a lot by people taking photographs on the narrow cat-walk.
,,Great place,5.0,,They have spent a lot of money to build this place good for half a day enjoyed a lot great fot pic taking
,,Cool rain forest,5.0,,It was amazing experience to have in Singapore by night start with day light and get into the dark and cool in the cloud forest
,,The Waterfall is STUNNING!,5.0,,"The man made waterfall and the engineering feat to encapsulate so many different habitats under one roof is simply Jaw dropping!. Such a pleasure to be here and walk around / down the waterfall viewing the various exhibits and zones. Excellent, kudos for this fantastic achievement. Tad expensive but worth it!"
,,Great building,5.0,,"The buildings are really impressive, the gardens are as well...although lots of the plant species inside are just regular garden/house plants in many temperate countries. Really worthwhile."
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"This destinations inside Gardens by the Bay offers not only an interesting but an educational experience, too.

Visitors are welcomed by a waterfalls right at the entrance--prepare to get wet and cold. The cloud forest is basically a mountain-like structure with several layers that one can climb by lift or a combination of stairs and escalators. The inner part features a different display per level, while the outer part showcases rare mountain plants of various origins--flowers, mushrooms, etc. These are accessible by hanging walkways, and audio tours are available for a fee.

It's great for those who want a different experience when in Singapore."
,,The best display in the whole place,5.0,,"This display is mind blowing. Spent 3.5 hours in there going through all seven levels, checking out the walks and all of the plants. The flowers and the displays gave us so much inspiration. Will do it again."
,,Unusual well done attraction,5.0,,"Enjoyed our visit here. You enter into an area with a large indoor waterfall and its cool and wet which is very welcome after being in Singapore's humidity. A lift takes you up to the top of the dome and you make your way down past the magnificent plants ( some very rare) downwards vis walkways and escalators.
Well worth a visit."
,,"I was left with ""Wow!""",5.0,,This is the highlight! The place is so beautiful! Had breath-taking mountain views. I enjoyed every bit of it.
,,Great,5.0,,"It isn't expensive and is great to get people off their phones 24/7 and see the true beauty of the world. Has a shop outside of it so you can buy souvenirs to keep memories. And, if you're hungry, there's another drink and ice cream shop right outside!"
,,photographers dream,5.0,,"This is the most amazing place, you can take a lift to the top and walk down via the walkway which is wheelchair friendly. you can purchase tiskets for $28 from most hotels ar at the gardens. the $28 covers both domes. it is quite cool in there which is a great escape from Singapores heat. the cafe is really nice we had Bangers and mash (more like Kabana and mash) which was really so nice. This place you must not miss while is Singapore."
,,breathtaking,5.0,,Really beautiful good balance of pretty foliage and education about ecosystems. Be wary of taking lift to level 6 if you have vertigo but there are different species of flowers and the best are at the top of the waterfall. The windy path was great as you can view all the different types of plants and flowers as you descend to lower levels. The flow of traffic is good allowing many photo opportunities even in peak tourist times.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"In Gardens by the Bay. Nice, cooling waterfall followed by elevator ride to top and twisting path back down with great vegetation and education along the way."
,,wanna see a fantasy world alive in your life time,5.0,,if u love fantasy then this cloud forest is your prime place to visit yes a dream heaven in earth ....... whatever your tension this place relax you no need medicine for your b.p to get normal an evening time like 4.30 pm till 6 will be a perfect time to visit this place ..... if god wills i will visit this place with my family again
,,A challenge if you have vertigo,5.0,,"I'm not a fan of heights or suspended bridges you can see through, but this place was so amazing I faced my fears. Imagine walking through a rainforest on suspended bridges, climbing 3 or 4 stories high with the aid of an elevator, no less. At the entrance is an impossibly high waterfall that did not entirely fit into my camera's viewfinder. No worries, you can take the elevator to the waterfall landing to take a photo looking down or a selfie that others will think you took at some exotic destination."
,,Cool spot on a hot day,5.0,,"This is a great place to spend a few hours wandering on a hot day. It is cool, having a massive waterfall and lots of mist jets o keep the plants cool. Lots of orchids and other flowers mixed with ferns and palms etc. Some very high walkways to looks down over it all."
,,A lovely retreat from a hot day,5.0,,"We come on a weekend, and even though it was quite crowded the walk ways were well played out so it was not frustrating with a lot of people. We really enjoyed the flowers and the wall garden. the water fall is a must see."
,,Amazing !,5.0,,Walking around you are dreaming of being in some remote Island waiting dinosaurs to pop out from the corner.. it's a MUST SEE.
,,Amazing and very interesting,5.0,,glad we went there... it's worth the visit... indoor water fall is just great to see... they have made this amazing indoor structure and put so much thought into it. it is definitely a must visit place in Singapore.
,,Amazing water fall,5.0,,It is like walking into a fantasy island of mystical waterfall. Walk into the waterfalls through the path and see the view from different perspective. Must see and experience.
,,Cool Place to Be At!,5.0,,This is a wonderful place for someone who appreciates the flowers and plants. Loads of information provided for each habitat but not overwhelming. Full of surprises at every corner. Value for money
,,Good - the views inside and outside are great,3.0,,"It's a nice attraction, the views inside and outside are great. However no big deal - the real nature has lot more offer... If you are rushed for time can give it a skip."
,,Beautiful and Cool Garden,5.0,,Wonderful way too cool off after touring the outdoor gardens. The waterfall is beautiful. Lots of greenery. The cloud forest is a walkway that wraps around the waterfall. It can be accessed via elevator or escalators. It was a very nice walk.
,,Just amazing!!!,5.0,,"I literally screamed woooow as soon as I entered the gates of the cloud forest and I was not alone. Others tourists who entered had similar reactions.

First visited in the afternoon around 2 and took a re-entry stamp at the exit to make sure that I see how it looks like in the evening in lights.

Best time to visit - During daylight. Evening was good too but it looked best in the daylight."
,,Very cool and calm.,5.0,,Wonderfully cool in the heat of the day. Wander around and enjoy the different views as you go higher in the dome.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"You are in for a senses overload. Incredibly well designed so even with hundreds of people visiting, you don't feel congested!"
,,A man-made wonder not to be missed......,4.0,,"This rates as one awesome & unique attraction that should not be missed when in Singapore.

Together with Flower Dome, a visit to Gardens by The Bay must include visits to these 2 man made wonders.

Don't let the small entrance fee for both attractions be a deterrent. It is definitely worth it.

Missed this & you missed an unique amazing attraction.
Its easy to come here. Take the MRT to Bayfront Station & follow the directional signs to Garden by the Bay."
,,Nice but EXPENSIVE !,4.0,,"A nice place to visit, especially if you like flowers and plant, but very artificial and not nature, entry ticket over-priced, may visit again 10 years later."
,,Memorable experience,5.0,,"Really loved our visit to the Cloud forest. Went to Gardens by the Bay and loved the particular visit to the cloud forest and the tulip gardens.
Getting there can be a bit difficult, especially if you are using the MRT. It is possible but it is one long long walk.
Went there during the day time but people tend to recommend evening visits. I am sure both are two great experiences.
Would highly recommend a visit when one is visiting Singapore.
Everywhere is very clean and maintained to A1 standard."
,,Refreshing,4.0,,"It is a very refreshing and awesome experience if you love water. I was first taking some photos from bit far but when I went near to the fall, it is totally a different experience. So so refreshing. So do go near to the falls to feel the wind and chillness. After that, a lift will take you to the top, to the skywalk - a trail goes down making a round through what you see in those pics. It is a good experience and very cold inside, I think 22-23degrees. So if you have small kids, you can keep some warm clothes or jackets. There is no other activities inside. Restrooms are there inside but no food or drinks."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,Such a cool experience & loved every minute of my visit there. Would highly recommend this for day or night visit.
,,It is really walking with clouds,5.0,,Wow. It is very amazing attraction spot. It is a forest in 6 floors levels with stairs and walk way around beautiful designed planets and flowers. Don't miss when you visit Singapore if you love beauty and green.
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"We all preferred this to the flower dome, we were in attendance for a misting, just be mindful of any camera equipment. Its lovely to walk up all the way around."
,,"It was like heaven on earth, best place in singapore",5.0,,"I had been in Himalayas sometime back and the environment they created artificially exactly looks like that was in Himalayas.
it was on excellent experience that on sunny day you can experience being in a hilly area with such mist and fog.
best place in singapore."
,,Another Engineering Feat!,4.0,,It is not often that you can see a torrent of water thundering down a huge tree and then take a walk on a pathway around the top of the tree!
,,Windy and relaxing,5.0,,"If you enjoy greenery, you'll love this place. The place welcomes you with a huge gush of wind.. A huge man-made waterfall. A very refreshing and relaxing attraction."
,,Cloud forest,3.0,,"Indeed, it's a beautiful and cooling place to visit. Especially during the hot day! The experience is just perfect!

However, I find it ""boring"" if you have visited it several times. Not much of activities / new excitements being introduced in the cloud forest!

The constant wet condition make the floor very slippery and may cause danger to young kids or elderly. Think they should improve the flooring system."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"An absolutely stunning experience. From the 5 storey waterfall to all the lush vegetation and little coves and lookout points, it is nothing short of breathtaking. If you feel the cold, bring something light to cover yourself."
,,Interesting But Very Wet,4.0,,"Must say I enjoyed the Gardens Under the Bay 10X more. The cloud with waterfall and all the foliage was interesting, but very wet. Be sure to wear the right shoes! Also provides a very high view to below from a bridge walkway -- beware anyone with height issues."
,,Stunning,5.0,,One of my fave things in Singapore and must see for any age. Wasn't sure what to expect but we loved it. Don't go when it starts getting dark though as it gets a bit hard to see on there.
,,Another Utopia,5.0,,"My favorite dome in the Gardens. Be it day or night, the experience is always refreshing - strolling around in the cool mist, hearing the waterfall, enjoying the view from the upper decks, seeing the sun rays leaking in through the glass panels while exploring the different levels of the tropical forest. A man-made wonder and beauty. On a good day, you can even see a rainbow at the waterfall. An experience not to be missed!"
,,Dream,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is spectacular! Worth the money paid to glimpse of how future environment may be attainable. In view of all the current ongoing environmental havoc (global warming, deforestation,...), Cloud Forest offers a wonderful hope of a more sustainable future."
,,Very nice Very interesting Enjoyable and Educating and Refreshing,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, do not miss a visit to Garden by the Bay and Cloud Forest. Bring along a good smartphone camera or compact camera to capture the moment. You need a whole day to cover the various exhibits. Do enjoy what they have to offer, I know I did so were two of my young nieces who took pictures using their own smart phones until their batteries ran out and they borrowed my Samsung S5 to continue shooting. I could see from their faces so much fun they even asked me to bring them along in my next visit."
,,Water fall and skywalk is worth,5.0,,"Waterfall and sky walk is worth to look and go around, sky walk in cloud forest is amazing, entrance has wonderful water fall, which they is highest water fall man made,sounds true"
,,Family outing,5.0,,The waterfall and the bridge is great place for bonding. Love the natural freshness and the eco system of the water works
,,Out of this world,5.0,,"Be ready to be transported to another world. One can be amazed at this beautiful recreation of a subtropical cloud forest at Gardens by the Bay. Right from the moss covered surfaces to the fern and epiphytes adorning the tress interspersed with waterfalls, all on a 42m high artificial hill. The eco educational display room had some sombre warnings on the effects of global warming. My personal favorites were the drift wood sculptures."
,,A Must see in Singapore,5.0,,This man made eco climate is a must see. The towering waterfall and a space which allows you to not only experice the external ecosystem but also I the internal with stalagmites. It's a wonder ! Be ware if your scared of heights - it's a high path down if you take the external path! Such an enjoyable place and if your lucky enough for it to be raining outside remember to look up at the glass roof for a special treat.
,,Cloud Forest Amazing,4.0,,The cloud forest dome is an amazing construction with a giant waterfall and a spiralling walkway down from the top with different levels of horticultural wonders
,,Awesome place to escape the heat!,5.0,,"This is such an amazing place to see. Lush vegetation, waterfalls and all under a huge climate-controlled dome that makes your visit very pleasant.
There is an elevator that takes you all the way to the top, where you can explore the multitude of plants, flowers and waterscapes. Then you climb down through stairs and suspended bridges, passing waterfalls and getting very close to the magnificent vertical gardens.
Overall, it's a must visit while in Singapore"
,,Man Made Waterfall.,4.0,,Near to flower dome. centers around a man made waterfall inside a climate controlled enclosure. awesome should visit place if with kids.
,,must see,5.0,,"Every one who comes to Singapore should see this, if nothing else. It is brilliant. We loved it and will return again."
,,The cloud forest in the closed dome is really awesome,4.0,,Water fall in the forest is good and get feeling like in real forest. Nature lovers will enjoy very much.
,,Forest in the heart of the city,5.0,,This is my favourite place - the cool misty atmosphere nuturing lush temperate flora in the heart of the City!! You can either climb a mountain to see such exotic plants or come to the cloud forest. I choose cloud forest.
,,Must Visit,4.0,,"Beautiful place , very creative and educative. You feel your in rain forest. Approximately you can cover all, in 2 hours."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Excellent experience for all, took two boys 6&10 absolutely loved the walkways and mountain.not to mention the animal carvings from exotic wood"
,,Breathless,5.0,,"From the moment you walk in, you will be in awe. Looks amazing and it is really refreshing coming inside from the heat and the first thing you are greeted with is the mist from the waterfall. Walking up, in & around this is well worth it. The lift will get you up to the top and you will make your way down from there. A must"
,,Very good place,4.0,,Very good place adjacent to Garden by the bay. Must visit with family and kids. Artificial clouds and mountain are really amazing.
,,"One word "" Awesome "" in the mist",5.0,,"Walking in the mist of earthly "" Heaven "".... The sound of the Waterfall is like a refresh to the soul. The feeling of "" Real "" forest here. Enjoyed very much"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Walking into the Cloud Forest feels like walking into a surreal, man-made, Shangri-La. The waterfall itself is lovely and makes for a wonderful photo opportunity if you are lucky enough to get a shot without swathes of photobombers. The mist rising in the dome is lovely. My favourite section is at the top of the walkway where there is a little pond surrounded by rich foliage and a variety of beautiful flowers and interesting carnivorous plants."
,,Cloudforest,5.0,,"We love the feel once you step in looking at the man made waterfall, taking lift up to the highest floor n enjoy the view to take a stroll walking down"
,,Amazing immersive experience,5.0,,"Amazing immersive experience in the cloud forest of high mountains of Borneo. Feel the humidity of the jungle, hear the water, climb to the top of the mountain and enjoy the views."
,,a forest in Singapore,5.0,,This attraction is a must see for tourist. It will display how capable Singapore is when it comes to renewable energy. The ecosystem and environment is closely mimic to some natural forest you can find around the world.
,,Incredible indoor ecosytems,5.0,,"At the Gardens by the Bay, there are two indoor pavilions, one which contains traveling exhibits, and Cloud Forest which is a permanent feature. Taking your first steps into the pavilion, you are greeted by a several story high waterfall. Following the well laid out paths, you are taken on a trail of discovery of various ecosystems from the highest elevation to the lowest, with interpretive signage to help describe what you are seeing and experiencing. The upper regions are accessed by a steel catwalk that offer the most amazing vistas out into the displays.
An absolute MUST SEE!"
,,Breathtaking....,5.0,,One has to visit the place to believe what can actually be created from elements of nature.... its absolutely mind blowing... a must visit place...
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,It was a great place to just hang around aND admire the place. I would go back to this place again on my next visit
,,Must visit,5.0,,Lovely.you actually feel you are in the forest.My African families will definitely enjoy the feeling.
,,Amazing afternoon,5.0,,"Fantastic afternoon spent in the cloud forest, was fun, informative and thoroughly enjoyable. A lot of walking and could be a problem for less mobile people or those who don't like heights, however definitely worth a visit. Take a jacket or cardigan can be cold inside the dome."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Great place to visit whilst in Singapore. A diverse range of species of plants and trees and very good for children. I would recommend a trip here for educational purposes as well as enjoyment.
,,Do bring a jacket!,5.0,,I was caught off guard the moment we went here because I wasn't expecting how cold it would be inside. I was foolish enough to wear shorts and a thin cardigan. Take note: it 's very cold inside and I do advice you to not take pictures near the waterfall because it will definitely fog up your camera (shoutout to those who'll be bringing dslrs). The foliage is very nice along with the view. I enjoyed looking at the landscape.
,,Worth it!,5.0,,"This was brilliant from the second we stepped into it. So interesting and so much to look at, experience and learn. This really is a must see."
,,Impressive,3.0,,It is an impressive theme park but I would say more close to the American way of thinking. The classic path before you arrive at the souvenir shop..
,,"Impressive entrance, but nothing more,",3.0,,"What you see on the picture is the most interesting part of the attraction. The rest is pretty much unimpressive. You also have to add about 40% to the entry price for Singaporeans if you're a visitor. If you have plenty of time, you may consider visiting this place."
,,Real life still exceeds man replicating nature,4.0,,"For what it is, it is really good. My only problem with the place, like any tourist place is that it is packed with people. Singapore however know who to deal with the crowd. Facilities, i.e toilet, shops and restaurants are plentiful. However, if you are just trying to have a walk with the trees, nature still exceeds this experience for me."
,,Architectural wonder - and interesting for a trip,5.0,,"This is like an indoor botanic garden inside a really cool building. Lots of lifts (and staff telling you to go in different directions), walkways, and interesting plant displays. Worth an hour's visit. Best kept secret is the kids water playground just down the pathway"
,,Ms,5.0,,Absolutely loved this - fantastic plants and walk around the dome - cool and refreshing with the waterfalls - we were lucky enough to go when the clouds were released which made it perfect - lovely afternoon
,,Garden of Prehistoric,5.0,,I already awe by the dome on the entrance. Upon entrance there is a man made waterfall which I will never expected inside the dome. Then we start from the very top of 5th floor visiting the wild orchid garden and some rare flowers. It's like stepping into the prehistoric era with all the strange plant..I mean a real plant. Then go down slowly using the sky bridge. I have to give Singapore a big point to have an idea to built somethings extraordinary garden in their limited land. Name as cloud forest because there is a artificial mist inside and it is cold inside which very contra with the hotness outside. Building such garden and maintaining it must take a big budget and real effort so there you go Singapore.Great work!!! This should never missed when you are in the city of lion.
,,WOW!!,5.0,,Omg what a place set in the Gardens by the bay this is a must visit!! When you walk intot his place you are met by one of the most beautiful waterfalls standing way above you its totally amazing. You can walk all the way around and take the walkway from top to bottom although for people scared of heights this is not reccomended as it is huge!! Gorgeous the whole way through and be sure to look out for the dragon sculptures.
,,Attractive nature experience in tropical area!!,5.0,,"If you want to avoid hot and humid circumstance, must run inside here to get natural atmosphere in the jungle and be cooler.

The huge fall you will see when you enter makes your minds clear like going down a splash slider in the water attraction.

Also, climbing up and down this artificial mountain is enough for you to create a false sense in your mind like walking through the tropical area."
,,Well worth the money,5.0,,"We did this as it looked interesting and it was. The sheer scale of the building, the planting of the flora, wooden features dotted through the garden had you looking around constantly to see what else was going to make you shake your head in amazement. You need to be there for the misting and absolute must see is the lego display of the vessel orchids."
,,out of world experience,5.0,,"the moment you step into the building it feels like you are in a magical place. And with the temperature outside you won't want to leave. what can i say, everything was beautiful to look at and it was great to see the plants and flowers from all over the world. it was certainly a highlight of our trip."
,,Awesome mad made waterfall!!! A great cooling place for a HOT SINGPORE,4.0,,"Its a must visit for both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome of Gardens by the Bay. Take the lift to the top level and stroll down slowly enjoying the views from the metal and glass bridge, which can be quite daunting for people who are afraid of heights."
,,Fantastic experience....,5.0,,"Fantastic experience....At the entrance we are greeted by a refreshing blast of cool air, followed by the sight of the world's tallest indoor waterfall, which rains down water and mist from above the floor."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"We took a multi-generational trip to Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Youngest 5, oldest 72. Beautiful place, very interesting, great way to spend a couple hours."
,,An out of the world experience.,5.0,,"THis place is a man made wonder, allowing you to experience the feel of walking on the clouds. We see plants and flowers everywhere from front, back, top and bottom. The unsupported walkway is just so excellent, safe and yet adventurous.The orchids canopy is a must place for lovely pictures."
,,Dreams fulfilled,5.0,,"Since knowing about this dome from television, movies and magazines I’ve been keen to visit and finally my dreams had come true. The moment you walk in there is a magnificent waterfall that you can get up close and personal with. The array of plants-ferns was truly wonderful and then to walk around the catwalk above was really exciting, you get a bird’s eye view of the forest and to finish off with a gentle reminder of what we can expect if we don’t do something about climate change but this is not done with a doom and gloom outlook alternatively giving you an idea that we can all make a change if we do something rather than nothing. Worth seeing."
,,Worth it for one evening. Visit it!,5.0,,"If you have family or kids, this is a great place to check out. Walk up to the highest level, see the waterfalls and walk down the various levels. Lots of fun!"
,,Not my thing but good,4.0,,"I'm not really a garden or flower person but this was a pretty good sight to see. A really good example of a man made natural garden/forest.

Lots of interesting stuff about climate change too.

Probably took us no longer than 1 hour to do it all."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"This is a must see especially if you love gardens. It is huge and quite unbelievable really. Lovely and cool too. You could walk around a ramp that was up very high and get a great look down onto the cloud forest.
We got there on dark but I would suggest get there earlier with more daylight."
,,Cool respite from the Singapore heat.,4.0,,We spent several hours enjoying this attraction. Well done and a good educational centre for the planet.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"So many amazing sites to see and an eye opener educationally, the movie they show called 5 degrees is really something, the cloud forest and indoor waterfall are just amazing and the Eco information as you walk around is really good- great place!!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful simulated cloud forest that greets you with waterfall as you first walk in. VERY well air conditioned and much chillier than it is in the humid outside. Scenic views on the inside plus there's certain times for ""misting"" the entire forest. I don't know exact times but I know one of the times is at 14:00 (2:00 pm) and happens every two hours after just don't know when it starts. Made everything inside look foggy and it was amazing.

Much more than just forest in here, there's also a stalactite ""cave"" and even a little video that shows how much our world will change by 2100 with the temperatures rising only 5° (most of it I'll be alive for). Very informative and the Cloud Forest was definitely much better (in my opinion) than the Flower Dome. Also if you get cold easily, bring something light to wear because it can get very chilly in there and I love the cold. I ended up seeing other people shivering or walking with arms crossed to stay warm. Enjoy the forest!"
,,Surprised!,5.0,,"This is one of the attractions that has most definitely exceeded my expectation. As you walk in your senses are overwhelmed by the smell of the rain forest, you see and hear a waterfall and you are trying to believe that you have just stepped from Singapore into a rain forrest. In my opinion a ""have to see"" and you need to make time to go though this attraction leisurely - it also incorporates a a number of exhibits that is very educational."
,,For anyone who never visited a real cloud forest an excellent choice,5.0,,Perfect way to learn about cloud forests and also other endangered natural Environments. Our group were fascinated by the articifical waterfall
,,Tranquil stroll in comfort,5.0,,Definatley worth strolling through for an hour or so especially when it's hot & humid outside or stay longer & watch short documentaries to learn about climate change & how it's affecting our planet.
,,Nature seen artificially,5.0,,Scenic view of in process extinct cloud forest displayed . Must see for anyone coming to Singapore especially kids
,,A modern forest,5.0,,"it's a super great idea to create a huge waterfall indoor. this is the spot light of this place, so take some time to take a photo in front of the waterfall and try to walk upstair to see singapore from above."
,,Nice to stroll around,3.0,,"Its lovely to stroll around and just look at the plant life.
It wasn't as hot and warm as outside, more cooler and moist.
It was a walk around a large mountain with vegetation growing on it.
There were 3 levels up to walk around, but not much else to do"
,,#1 Attraction within Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"If you are tight on time or money and only want to visit one attraction within the Gardens by the Bay, i would highly recommend the Cloud Forest. The moment you walk in, you are in awe. There is no wonder why so many people are trying to take a photo of the beautiful water feature.

Pros:
Great photo opportunities
You can take an elevator to the top and make your way down by walking
Great place to stay cool and stay away from the heat

Cons:
It can get crowded in certain spots so patience is required
There is a fee to enter the Cloud Forest (but definitely worth the fee)"
,,Heaven in a Dome,5.0,,"If I were strapped for time and had to pick between the Cloud dome and the Flower one, I think the cloud dome was my favourite.

Make sure you find out when the mist timings are and try to be there when it happens. Its absolutely worth it.

Can get a little chilly. If you have a low tolerance for the cold carry a thin jacket with you.

The way the entire thing is arranged is like a mini history/botany lesson on plants, and is absolutely beautiful. Make sure you go all the way to the top and take your time coming down.The view inside and outside the dome makes it worth it."
,,Spectacular! See the world's largest indoor waterfall!,5.0,,"See my review of The Gardens By The Bay for more details, but I loved this place. Well worth the entry fee. Amazing feat of engineering, architecture, design and botany."
,,Awesome flowers,5.0,,"I never seen these kind of flowers , very beautiful garden very nice waterfalls , i had very nice experience"
,,Don't leave Singapore without seeing this,5.0,,"An amazing climate controlled experience, replicating the cooler, humid conditions of a rain forest in the mountains. Inside the temperature is a chilly 60 plus degrees - outside a steamy 80-90 degrees. The flowers and foliage are incredible, and the experience literally is breath-taking."
,,Incredible building and ecosystems.,5.0,,"What a fantastic place to spend some time- easy to have a few hours fly by, and very easy to reach on MRT."
,,The Highlight of my Singapore trip,5.0,,"$16 adult admission. Could spend many hours. Its a wonderland of flowers waterfalls rainforest, sculptures walkways and magnificent views . Children and adults alike were overawed. Absolutely fabulous. Can't recommend it enough."
,,A truly amazing enclosed garden,5.0,,"This is a very large enclosed garden which reproduces the environment and presents the flora at different altitudes. Recommend visiting during the hottest time of the day as it is nice and cool inside. We particularly enjoyed the variety of plant life, including the section of carnivorous plants. We would have expected more detailed scientific explanations of the different bio-zones and the corresponding plant life. The information panels available were too generic and did not add to our understanding. The overall effect and the complex engineering required to construct such a place were both very impressive. Note that while the Gardens by the Bay are free, you need to purchase a ticket which includes entrance to the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Both must be visited on the same day."
,,A must!,5.0,,"Other than being a very cool and refreshing temperature on a warm Singapore day, the Cloud Forest is stunning and a must-see. Try to get up to the top walking platforms during misting times - very pretty."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,What a beautiful and amazing place to visit. Plants are spectacular Surprised that it was cold in there so take a jacket or scarf
,,Must visit in singapore.,5.0,,"Must visit in singapore. one of the best artificial waterfalls and mountain setup. Chillness is the best here. Kids will enjoy the best. 3 levels of layers . all the views from different level is best, good photography place."
,,Beautiful Garden in the city,4.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay, this is a must visit when in Singapore. Many different plants to see, in a nice cooling environment."
,,Nice picture point,4.0,,"Especially at night , you can take nice pictures due to lights up and some misty time in this forest. Fine spot for families , kids and couples . Visit here ! 特に夜は素敵な写真が撮影できます。 ライトアップされ、ミストタイムで植物が良く映えます。 家族、お子さん、カップルにもオススメ。 ぜひ一度(^^)"
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,One thing for sure that whatever Singapore ventures into makes it d best..This is truly mesmerising with a huge man made waterfall n a lift takes you right to the top n then you come down d ramp appreciating the breathtaking views of Singapore from a height..Wonderful flora n fauna covering around the height of d waterfall..It actually feels like being in the clouds..A must visit place..
,,Stunning - not to be missed,5.0,,"Wow, this place is spectacular. We spent about 90 minutes there because we were in a rush to finish before sunset. I recommend starting earlier and spending 3 hours. There is basically a large planted mountain complete with waterfall built inside the dome, with heaps of elevated walkways and amazing plant life. It's Air conditioned which is lovely on a hot day.
We spent S$71 for 2 adults and a 9 year old kid to visit 2 conservatories, this and the flower dome (also highly recommended). Also spent S$9 to catch the shuttle bus from the main gate and S$32 on lunch at McDonald's.
Our plan was the 2 conservatories, then gardens by the bay lightshow at sunset for about half an hour, then walk over to marina bay sands for the 9:30 lightshow. It worked perfectly and I recommend this itinerary. Allow at least 90 minutes per clouds/flowers conservatory, preferably more.
Tips:
1. If it's hot invest in the bus trip from the front gate, $3 per person. If not it's a long walk and you'll melt.
2. There's a great McDonald's restaurant right near the cloud forest, highly recommended and clean.
3. Cloud forest is great on a hot day as its really cool inside (same as flower dome).
4. Do the 2 conservatory trip as the flower done is great also
5. Go to the gardens by the bay light show after that.
6. Charge those camera batteries, you'll want to take hundreds of photos here!
ENJOY!
PS my nine year olds son kept saying its one of the best days he's ever had. Kids love this."
,,Worth the entrance fee,5.0,,Amazing - a must do for any traveler to Singapore. Do take a light cardigan or jacket as it can get chilly inside the dome.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Its worth every dollar to see this amazing place we loved everything about it. There were so many things to see and absorb in the forest we couldn't stop taking photos.
,,Good Side Trip in S'pore,4.0,,"I've seen this from a distance many times, so this trip I thought I'd give it a try. You've probably seen pictures of the high walkway around the forest and waterfalls. It's well worth a visit. My only suggestion is to be sure you take the S$3 shuttle from the MRT station as it is a bit of a walk to get there."
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"It would be a shame if you visit Singapore without going into the Could Forest, it was a great experience that left my in awe, it's really amazing that this whole ""forest"" is man made."
,,Gorgeous!!,5.0,,"You just want to stay inside to enjoy the plants, the view from up there, the landscape,the flowers. But take a swear shirt or a pull over with you it's very cool and humid inside"
,,Just Awesome,5.0,,"As you enter this dome, you are awestruck by the almost four storey high man-made waterfall. The cloud mountain is fully covered with lush vegetation of various variety.
As you walk deeper you come to a 'Lego' decorated section where you see Pitcher Plants, Venus Fly Traps, Snake Plants etc- the exotic carnivorous plants about which we have only read but now got a chance to see them- live. The varieties of ferns, orchids and anthuriums are just mind boggling.

From 'The Lost World' located at the top of the mountain, as you take the 'Cloud Walk' you engulfed by the clouds. The experience is just beyond words and the view of Marina Bay just splendid. The sculpture of two Bald Eagles just perfect. All this casts a spell which lingers long in your memory.

Cloud Forest is inside a huge fully air conditioned dome covered by thousands of glass panes and the whole structure is without columns.

One can buy tickets for the Cooled Conservatories- 'Flower Dome' & 'Cloud Forest', from the same ticket window, jointly or separately, depending on how long you intend to spend. For nature photographers one day will be too little. Passports not required unless you wish to take audio-guide or a wheelchair or a locker. There are many food outlets outside the Conservatories.

A must visit place."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,The indoor waterfall is quite awesome. We went there at night and the mountain was lighted in different colours.
,,Beautiful plants in a massive green house,5.0,,This conservatory has plants from cool highland zones up to 2000 metres above sea level. It also has a beautiful 35m water which is the world's tallest indoor waterfall.
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Unbelievable, a must see. Part of the Gardens by the Bay Botanic Garden, the attention to detail is amazing."
,,Beautyyyy,4.0,,"Nice place to visit. It has a huge man made waterfall and lot of plants around. You would experience the forest atmosphere and would recommend to visit this. It is for all ages and easily accessible.

Make sure to take some water as this involved lot of walking."
,,Awesome!!!!,5.0,,"This attraction is NOT to be missed. Simply spectacular! A entire rain-forest with huge indoor waterfalls has been created. All kinds of trees and plants can be found here. There is a sky-bridge on the top floor from which one can have stunning aerial views on the entire facility. Walking your way down, there are other attractions like the crystal rock formations, awareness about maintaining ecosystems etc, Safe for children to go but with adult supervision. Those suffering from vertigo may not enjoy the sky-bridge walk."
,,Happy.,4.0,,"It is well worth a visit but don't forget a big jumper, it is freezing inside. Still it feels good to see so much vegetation. A must visit with the kids."
,,Impressive but a little samey,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the completely man-made ""nature"" attractions in Singapore, this time in the shape of a small ""mountain"" complete with a waterfall.

The basic gist of the place is that it simulates the conditions at an altitude very few of us will otherwise visit, and the humidity and the feel are admittedly something else. (Get ready to get gently soaked.)

The misty mountain is impressive, even if it is just a skeleton of steel and concrete covered in plantlife. At night, it looks like a giant otherworldly mothership hovering over you.

The plants are a bit, well, samey though. There isn't a great deal of variety to be had, and unless you have a keen botanical eye, you won't be able to tell one leafy thing from the next.

That said though, you aren't likely to see a building this crazy anywhere else, so it is worth it to go in and just enjoy the Cloud Forest dome as a unique architectural showpiece. Soak in the moisture and the feel of the place."
,,A new wonder of the world,5.0,,"A new must see in Singapore. I have to admit, I have not seen anything so amazing before. The sheer scale, the incredible number of plant varieties as well as landscapes make it a new wonder of the world. Good signals, explanations and educational scheme, well done."
,,wonderful,4.0,,amazing concept. The design and concept is truly amazing. Very interesting and educational for children who can get the feel of walking through a cloud forest. The misting to is beautiful
,,amazing! *o*,5.0,,in love with this place! gigantic waterfall and all inside really surprise me! want to stay longer there :D
,,Worth overcoming your fear of heights.,5.0,,This dome was our favourite of the two. The variety and siz of the trees is amazing. There was even some from our home country there. The waterfall as you come in sets the scene and the path in the sky is well worth the walk even for those of us who have a fear of heights. The sculptures are very good and great photo opportunities. Spent more time in this dome than the flower dome but both are worth visiting. Well done to the people who designed and look after these wonderful gardens and trees.
,,Must visit place,5.0,,Must visit this place when in Singapore. Carry liquid with you. Be prepared to spend 4 to 5 hours there. So much variety of flora and fauna in one place.
,,amasing,5.0,,this was a werry nice suprise to se that big whaterfall and all the green like a rainforest the elewather too the topp and slowly walking down on the way back was great
,,An artificial waterfalls.,3.0,,We visited cloud forest expecting a lot. But was disappointed. The plants are natural but not all. waterfalls is man made and is indoor which is great. But would make more sense if they made it look natural. some of the flowers are made with Lego. It's a one timer but I still recommend spend your time and money elsewhere.
,,Amazing Wonder!,5.0,,"The cloud forest must be on any visitors hit list! The entire experience transports you to a mountain retreat from the heart of the city and everything from the waterfalls to the art is perfectly composed.

To reach the MRT takes you to bayfront and a short walk through the gardens at bay brings you to the huge domes. Online it appears foreigners can only but a combined ticket for both domes SG$28 but I'm enquirey it is possible to get just the cloud forest for SG$16. Both are worthy of a visit if you have time but if you can only do one then make it the cloud forest for a truelly surreal experience.

Highly recommended for everyone of all ages!"
,,Go visit,4.0,,This is a nice place to visit. You can either walk from the entrance of the Garden's by the bay on which you need to bear the sun and heat. 15 mins of walking will take to you cloud forest. Inside its an airconditioned dome. You can opt to ride a golf cart like ride which cost around usd2 per person.
,,Just amazing💚,5.0,,Being in Singapore and not visiting this amazing cloud forest is nonsense. This is really an amazing kind of forest with its indoor waterfall💙
,,Stunning,5.0,,I wrote about this on my review for Gardens by the Bay too. I would highly recommend... The waterfall is stunning and the views from the top or spectacular! You can even see the F1 lots which was me was super exciting :)
,,A bit pricey but an amazing experience and worth a visit,4.0,,The place is simply amazing and gives you the real waterfall experience. All the green inside already gives you a soothing effect and in addition to that the nicely climate controlled environment makes the visit even more enjoyable. Absolutely stunning seeing something man made giving such a real feeling. There is no issue of space inside neither is there an issue of having to stand in long queues so it is more than recommended. It is just a bit higher on the price.
,,well maintained,3.0,,The concept is simple to make you feel like walking from height and viewing the forest. there are three levels for one to enjoy the view. Decent ride I can say
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"There is nothing that hasn't been thought of to include in this attraction to give the visitor the maximum experience, knowledge and environmental understanding. Built so strong, so safe and allows for visual experience as well as physical when the mist is sprayed. The waterfall is outstanding and the various levels allow for easy access to different aspects of this simulated rain forest. Love the artwork made out of the roots of trees. We have similar roots at home and it gave us ideas of what we could do with ours! All plants are regularly tendered so they are in prime condition and flowering - no dead leaves or blooms in sight. A credit to Singapore and a pleasure to have visited."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"So much more to it than I expected. Beautiful inside, and climate controlled as well so a nice break from the heat and humidity. Very informative and some great environmental messages as well. Highly recommend."
,,Must do Singapore,5.0,,"Amazingly Ng structure that blows you away when inside. From the waterfall at the start through the various plants and formations to the cloud formation at the end, absolutely stunning with plenty of room for everyone. Keep your eyes out for the amazing sculpture also, the detail in these is incredible."
,,Nice visit at night,5.0,,"An attractive place to visit. The night light makes the dome looks so beautiful. They have an indoor waterfall. The splashes make the ground pretty wet, but the material they used and th printed pattern on the ground makes it non slippery. This shows the attention to the details when they build this come. This dome is air conditioned. I think it does generate some of its own power."
,,Real rainforest feel,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest in the Gardens by the Bay is a great attraction within the Marina Bay Area. It costs $23 and usually has shorter queues than the Flower Dome.

The environment in the Forest feels very real and the waterfall is spectacular. There is a great variety of flowers, geological and architectural sights within the dome and some great views from the walkways at the top of the waterfall.

Definitely worth a visit"
,,Tallest indoor waterfall indeed,4.0,,"Stunned by the tallest indoor waterfall at the entrance. Walk on the layers behind the waterfall to experience it. A botanical lover should never miss this. Same like ""Flower Dome"", they both are a great heat and rain escape place."
,,Better part of gardens by the bay,4.0,,This is in seven levels. You first go by lift to the seventh level and keep coming down. The effects of deforestisation is explained very forcefully. At the entrance there is huge man made water falls.
,,Its beautiful!,5.0,,"You might feel little cold inside, especially after loitering around warm tropical Singaporian weather before entering, so keep some light warm cloths."
,,Excellent combine with GBB,5.0,,Take Gardens By Bay and Cloud Forest together. It's worth enjoying man made forest feel in near downtown.
,,cool,5.0,,one of the best places i love to visit. been to this attraction a lot of times and will always recommend to my friends as a must visit .its education as well.
,,"It is good , but not enough",4.0,,"Once we enter the attraction , it is just the same thing you see at the big ing , there is nothing to see at all , and this attraction is too big , and it is designed like a maze , where we lost our family menber ."
,,Humid with feeling of rainforest,4.0,,I loved the place which felt like being inside a rainforest. There was a huge fall. There are many layers which you can climb or take lift. Each layers has its own beauty.
,,Cool Greens,4.0,,"The cloud forest gives a good inpression about the rainforest. It could be bigger or have few smaller versions aside. Too crowded on eavery day a week, as many locals using the freshness to cool down."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This place was among my favorite places alongside Gardens By The Bay and Botanical Garden. They are all near each other so you can do all three at once.

The way they designed and created this place really relaxes your mind and body you just want to stay here forever."
,,loved it!,5.0,,"Having travelled the world over, I am always impressed by how well the Singapore government has managed to create attractions that are creative, interesting, clean and entertaining . A feat in itself. This is a haven of cool and peace after the heat and humidity outside."
,,Wonderland and cool.,5.0,,Wonderful place to stroll for two hours. You can see orchids and other plants. Walk along a three story garden with a waterfall. Get a chance to cool down.
,,A bit pricey for what it is,3.0,,"Although an amazing place to visit - and one should at least once in their lifetime, the pricing system and cost is quite high. Still worth a visit to see the magnificent waterfall and usually the exhibits are quite fascinating."
,,My biggest surprise,5.0,,After a morning in the Flower Dome I was pleasantly surprised by the Cloud Forest. It was innovative and at every level there was yet another surprise. The crystal garden was outstanding and the staging of the plants was exceptional. The wood carvings were great fun - worth every $.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,It was amazing to see something s artificial yet so beautiful. Iit was so fresh that I just cant believe it was artificial. Waterfall was so beautiful and a great site to see. Definitely gotta go to the top too! I can't wait to go back again when I can.
,,A beautiful experience,5.0,,Like walking through a rain forest; next to the flower dome and worth buying the two tickets together. Easy to walk around (and lift access for the higher points).
,,loved it,5.0,,Singapore once again shows its commitment to giving people quality tourist attractions. this is well worth a visit
,,"Brilliantly done, great couple of hours",5.0,,Highly recommended for all. Very cool are (temp and atmosphere). Great explanations and scary view on the worlds future as we heat up.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Amazing! I would've spent the whole day there if I could. The vibe of the place is just something else. The dome creates such a great ambiance, combined with a great view on the bay."
,,Up there!,5.0,,This was a fantastic experience - not to be recommended for anyone not keen on heights. The gardens are immaculate and have an amazing array of plants even including NZ Silver Ferns!
,,"Cool, Amazing indoor waterfall.",5.0,,"First to recognize when enter this place is the coolness and freshness of the forest and waterfall. Feels very good especially after a long walk from MRT station to this place under the sunny hot weather. Immediately, you absorb the freshness to yourself. The waterfall is awesome and beautiful. We take the elevator to the highest floor and walk all away down thru the path way. For those who afraid of height, this could be a challenge because you can see clearly down below. while walking, we can also see wonderful view of the garden by the bay and the city outside the dome. Overall, it is great to visit here. next time, we will take a shuttle. It is a paid shuttle ride, It takes you from Bayfront station (the exit Bayfront MRT) to the Conservatory station (Flower dome and cloud forest). The ticket can be used to return to the station too."
,,interesting tropical forest,4.0,,"good indoor forest. the fall is amazing, you can even see \the rainbow. the experience with clouds is also good."
,,"Shadey, green, cool...",5.0,,"Completely artificial, yet highly impressive. Nice experience for a hot summer day on Singapore. Great views of the Marina Bay Sands."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Was stunning , pristine and interesting. Nice and cool inside so was a relief to get out of the humidity as well. lots to see and many hidden surprises."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,It's really impressive on how they have manage to maintain this in a controlled environment. It is relaxing and I would love to visit again.
,,another attraction in marina bay sands,5.0,,just next to flower dome this is also fully air conditioned ....there is a huge waterfall inside and large variety of plants.....
,,Spectacular waterfall and gardens,5.0,,As part of Gardens by the Bay this is really huge man made waterfall which you can walk around and to the top. Also offers great views across to singapore
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful place. Well worth a look. Super hot and sticky inside!! I am not a huge fan of orchids but was totally converted after this trip. Went in Jan 2015 just didn't think to review it on here.
,,Plant lovers heaven!,5.0,,The scale alone is stunning! The different types of tropical plants and flowers are just flabbergasting. I especially loved walking down the suspended bridge that gives a nice view of that vast wall.
,,Urban forest dome,5.0,,"A lovely structured tropical forest with sky walks and well controlled temperature. Makes ones feels like walking above the cloud. Kids will love it if they adventurous and not afraid of height. Footwear with good grip is recommended, avoid heels."
,,Very impressive and it is a bit cold inside,5.0,,"It is quite cold inside so make sure you have a sweater, it is really impressive how they have managed to great a forest inside a glass dome. Must see."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, one of the places that is worth going to is Gardens by the Bay - I personally enjoy the 2 domes the most. Cloud Forest was scary for me - as I was slightly afraid of height, but it felt secure and I enjoyed the view. A lot of effort and thoughts were put into the construction of this place (you may miss the fact that it has no structural beams).. so it's worth going."
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,This is one of amazing indoor garden in the world. You can see the waterfall. Tropical forest in many layer. Cant just an hour for a visit. Many hing to explore... Also visit the flowe dome. Its combine ticket.
,,Careful if scared of heights,4.0,,"We went to the cloud forest over the garden festival and the sights are very pleasant.
Please note when it is busy like the day we went it can get quite scary on the cloud walk (low rails and see through walls 20 m in the air). As kids run passed and bump into you and you don't want to be knocked off."
,,"fantastic, amazing",5.0,,"well worth it, amazing constructioin, nice and cool on a hot day, cheap, you cant visit the gardens and miss this!!"
,,good,4.0,,"another of the numerous attractions the city has to offer, decent enough to get a look at if you're interested"
,,Stunning architecture mixed with world class plant and bloom exhibits,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a magical experience and a photographer's dream. Wandering through the many levels of the forest you are surrounded by prime quality plant and bloom specimens in an idyllic setting. The period ""rainstorms"" and continual mistings all add to an immersive experience that is truly enjoyable."
,,Great,5.0,,Great place. Very impressive structure. It was a muggy hot day and the cool mist (if you go during a misting session) was very refreshing. Lots of stairs for a good workout or take the lifts.
,,Loved IT!,5.0,,Amazing experience with lots of information about global warming and earth resources. Different levels to explore around with man made waterfall and mountain forest. Admission for foreigners is $28 for two conservatories (Flower dome and cloud forest). Not to miss while in Singapore.
,,Modern urban forest.,5.0,,"Stand close to the waterfalls and look up! Quite an amazing experience. It's a must to walk around the entire vicinity, you'll see views of Singapore from a unique perspective. Temperature was just nice in the cloud forest too, not too humid or hot."
,,On of the mist fantastic man made gardens if the world,5.0,,There are often many visitors but as is typical of Singapore it is very safe and very well run. It is suited to children and wheelchair guests. The plants are just fabulous and the concept is brilliant. I would hate to think of how much it cost to build and maintain. Congratulations Singapore.
,,Gardens By the Bay,4.0,,Nice new attraction. Went there because relatives visiting from US. Pleasant. Nice addition to Singapore attractions.
,,Green Green with waterfall,5.0,,"Man made waterfall and fogging indoor garden, never been there? Must try to visit once in a life time. You can take Flower Dome and Cloud Forest package in one day."
,,Cloud nine,4.0,,"A great experience, especially on a hot day. To see a rainforest in the city and a waterfall was amazing. We were there on a very hot day and the relief from the air con and the waterfall spray was so good.
Its amazing what can be built these days, the plant life and natural wonders of the cloud forest are so good.

A definite must visit."
,,NIce but once is enough!,3.0,,Good experience but super crowded on weekends. The waterfalls were quite spectacular and it was really cooling in the dome. May need a shawl if you dun like the cold.
,,Average,3.0,,didnt quite like the feel .. though the place is cool and chilling.. Somehow I didnt like the gloomy feeling. Overall the waterfall is great. A wonder at the man-made marvel.. Wont go for the second time though! A one-time visit for sure...
,,The waterfall is Stunning!,4.0,,Being a nature lover I was amazed at what they've accomplished here. Creating a micro environment for non native species of practically every region around the world! Kids loved the waterfall. Tad steep for the price but definitely worth a visit. Enjoyed walking down the sky walk.
,,Quite nice,4.0,,The place is nice for photos. Can say that it is quite romantic as well. But nothing much to be honest. Just enjoy the cool aircon + water blowing at you. That's all. I would say you have to go to experience it but just once is enough.
,,"Stunning visuals, a lovely refreshing walk.",5.0,,"We took this during one of the hotter days. The blasts of cool, fresh air were worth it alone, but the views of the plants, the waterfalls will just take your breath away. The walk among the clouds is just another of the amazing experiences in Singapore."
,,You can see natures wonder and how humans are damaging it,4.0,,"The importance of cloud in the ecology and how they sustain life at high altitude is shown here
You will also get a good view of the singapore river and marina sands tower from here
There us an entry fee in addition to the entry to gardens"
,,Pretty chilly,3.0,,Well for $20 I thought it was fairly reasonable it was definitely worth a while. The cloud forest is definitely a place to visit you can see some pretty awesome plants and trees and it's very well maintained.
,,WOW factor!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a large conservatory, enclosed in an Architecturally impressive glass framed structure. The conservatory replicates very specific climate conditions found at specific height levels in tropical mountains, and thus they are able to replicate growth and life found at these tropical mountains. There are many levels on which you can walk, although it is probably not suitable for those who have a fear of heights, It can get a bit chilly inside the Cloud Forest, so you might want to take something warmer to wear. This is a stunning attraction and although the ticket price is a bit steep at $28 for adults it is worth a visit."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"So worth going in! It's air conditioned, there's a beautiful waterfall and different levels to be explored. We really enjoyed it."
,,Singapore Trip,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. We were a bit reluctant as we thought it would be a small display of ferns, but it was absolutely fantastic."
,,Quick stop,4.0,,"The cloud forest is very nice to stop by. Be aware you could catch a cold or something as the inside temperature is controled and much lower than outside temperature. People who are sensible to temperature change should bring an extra layer.
Great view and impressive structure! Must see if in Singapore !"
,,"Cool, very cool.",5.0,,"This is such a unique undertaking by Singapore to recreate a cloud forest environment in a huge glass domed space. You will not fine anything like this anywhere else asides the real cloud forest

It is big, you can spend at least an hour walking around. There are misting throughout the day which creates a cloud effect. The dome itself is quite a sight, it defines green architecture.

It is not affordable and can run thought your pocket if with kids, but everything will in Singapore, and you probably wouldn't be here if that were a concern so just go!"
,,Man made cloud forest.,4.0,,Man made but with almost everything one could expect to find in a cloud forest. The waterfall at the entrance is very beautiful. There are so many different plants and flowers in bloom that make an expectable for the eyes. It also educates people about the environment and the need for conservation.
,,WOW!!!,5.0,,So exciting to walk through the different levels and experience the Forest from down to top and down again. Nature pure under the dome.
,,Beautiful garden display,5.0,,Definitely a must see when in Singapore. It's a beautiful and interesting place that will definitely make you envious if your into gardening
,,Amazing...Don't miss,4.0,,Simply amazing how they can fit all that under one dome. Missed it last trip...check in the block now. Do not miss this. Thank God for the elevator to the top and only had to walk down the various layers of the mountain range.
,,Cold and nice view,4.0,,"Cloud forest is the coldest than flower dome. Whether is daytime or night time remain cold temperature. Floor are wet must be careful and please do not run as you might slip down due to wet floor.

The real cloud have different timing to come out please ask the counter when the cloud will be out."
,,A cool place,5.0,,"A huge, amazing waterfall at the entrance and a trip up into the skies are really worth every penny and second of you time. The entire Cloud Forest has also a subtext woven into it about recycling and preservation of nature, which makes it both awesome and educational. The view from the top is one of those things you will always remember, but it is not for the faint hearted."
,,Super Cloud Forest,5.0,,Super Man Made Forest Man Made City Coolness is Fully Maintained Mostly All Flower are there each and every thing is Beautiful
,,Not too bad...,3.0,,"It's a beautiful place. I am not a huge fan of flowers but I find it a good place for families, couples, friends to just spend time together. It's a pretty relaxing place too :)"
,,above the clouds,4.0,,"living in singapore usually means that we dont get to do the touristy things, but we went to the gardens by the bay recently. The flower dome was not very special but the cloud forest we liked. Nicely done, impressive waterfalls and information to go along with it"
,,Spectacular creation,5.0,,A real must see.There is nothing natural about this sheer feat of engineering. It has to be experienced and not rushed.Another reason why Singapore is not just a stopover...you really need some time to appreciate it fully.
,,Wow,5.0,,"If you only do one thing in Singapore do this. Its like a visit to a future space age biosphere , stunning and because its air conditioned ,more comfortable than other garden tours"
,,Too Fake,2.0,,I guess if you have never travelled this maybe interesting but everything was too fake and lacked detail to achieve their objective. A large waterfall with metal spillways. Stalagmites sitting as dead objects without water dripping on them. A large structure with a winding high level path with plants.
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,One of our favorite attractions we have visited in Singapore. The place is completely covered and air conditioned which makes the experience even better. The kids will completely love it.
,,brilliant indoor garden,5.0,,"the various level of the building represent different height inside a tropical rain forest, the result showing is truly wonderful. can't expect a greenhouse can be so attractive"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,We really enjoyed our visit to Gardens by the Bay and especially the Cloud Forest. Go earlier in the morning or later in the evening to avoid the crowds. Be sure to pack a sweater or wrap - it can be quit cold.
,,Vertical horticulture at it's best,5.0,,"The family thoroughly enjoyed the visit, well worth a stroll through to escape the heat of the Singapore day, the waterfall is lovely and the gardens are impressive."
,,breathtaking,5.0,,Truley a way to walk amongst the clouds when the mister is on. Beautiful in all aspects. Great for family friends and even couples.
,,Travel into the mountains within a metropolitan city,4.0,,Amazing man made mountains within a urbanised city! Feel the mountain coolness with an amazing waterfall and a wide array of exotic habitats of plants!
,,Stunning! Must see!,5.0,,I visited Cloud Forest during a business trip and it was spectacular. I arrived at 9am to beat the midday rush and having walked from Chinatown the blast of cool air on entry was well received. A grand waterfall awaits you and the journey begins. Kew Gardens in London is a dot in comparison (although not visited for some time). Take a comfortable pair of shoes as you will 'trek' through each area. Great day in the memory bank.
,,Excellent rain Forest,5.0,,"This was a wonderful exhibition of a rain forest, within a large dome covered, climate controlled area, with walks over, under waterfalls, tree top walks, high above on platforms, anther great day."
,,Small Place but Cool,4.0,,This is a very cool place in HOT summer. Place is very small vis a vis impressions you get from pictures.NIce place to stay for an hour or so. Skip it if you are less than three days in singapore>
,,Amazing,5.0,,The cloud Forrest was totally amazing. The plants and the way the whole area is laid out is unbelievably. Is you go here make sure your cam area is fully charged.
,,Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The themes changes few times a year ! My favorite must the Lego inspired plants !
There is a water fall the minute you enter the cloud forest . This provide a great relief on a Hot day .
A sky walk that slopes gradually downwards allows you the admire all sorts of tropical vegetations !"
,,Must see,5.0,,It was a real treat for the eyes...must do for all nature lovers. U can do both the domes even if it's raining...
,,Must go !!!,5.0,,If you're visiting Singapore you must visit this place. You can book tickets for this conservatory only at their ticket booth.
,,A day to remember,5.0,,this is a great place to take the kids. very informative and awesome technology to run it all. The colours and variety of plantings are breathtaking. There were Lego flower displays too.
,,absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"These are amazing to see, you can't imaging what is inside until you get in there, takes a while to get all way round but is definitely worth the visit"
,,Singapore Paradise,4.0,,It is the Singapore paradise.The plants are green and very cool inside.For me It is very relax to stay inside nearly 3 hours without tiring.
,,Don't Miss!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was a truly special place to visit - felt totally surreal! The mist timings are listed on the Cloud Forest website - we visited at 8 pm and it was a bit challenging to take good photos because of the mist. On the other hand, not so many visitors at that time, which definitely added to the atmosphere."
,,A good choice in the Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Very nice elevated walkways, and impressive rain forest with big waterfall. They also have a good information movie, and some interesting exhibitions as well."
,,Outstanding. Pay the money!,5.0,,"Don't be tempted to miss out on these glass houses just because they cost a fair amount of money. They're the highlight of the gardens, and they're air-conditioned!"
,,A Must-See if Visiting Singapore!,5.0,,Cloud Forest is an incredible structure worth seeing in Singapore. The vegetation is awesome and you learn so much about southeast Asia.
,,More than just a waterfall,5.0,,"I was a little underwhelmed by the waterfall that seems to get so much attention, but we loved walking slowly around the dome, a nice respite from the Singapore heat, spotting the wooden sculptures throughout. What a fantastic idea and cool way to spend a couple of hours."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"This was the most amazing garden, and an excellent place to spend a rainy or hot afternoon. It was so cold, we needed sweaters. Our 4 year old twins loved this place, and so did we."
,,Better of the 2 Domes,4.0,,The Cloud Forest was interesting. The huge indoor waterfall and the mist which appears every couple of hours is replicate of being in an actual forest. The high walkways are good although I think small children would be scared as the outer edges of the walkway are just grate. Adults too could be a bit unnerved. It can also get a little cool so take a covering.
,,Wonderfull,5.0,,"I fall in love with this place. its feel not like in Singapore or Asia, its like in heaven. the conservatory is cold and have 7 level. Its little bit scary in cload walk but its unforgotable."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,This is part of the Gardens by the Bay. These man-made dome is wonderful to behold. The water fall gave a refreshing misty breeze. The variety of plants is incredible. This is a must visit site in Singapore.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"The indoor water fall is one of the largest in the world! Very cool to see, especially at misting time. The sky walk is also great - even for those a bit scared of heights. My mum normally doesn't do heights, but she did this!"
,,The best part of the Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Take the time to enjoy this exceptional area of the Gardens by the Bay. Take the lift to the walkway in the clouds, & pick the best time when the mist is activated daily at 10:00am, 12:00pm, 2:00pm, 4:00pm, 6:00pm, and 8:00pm."
,,Man made natural beauty!,5.0,,"Isnt it just amazing to witness a man made forest and waterfall indoors? Just mind blowing! The architecture, the execution of this whole dome is simply fantastic. When the just enter the cloud dome the sudden change in temperature resets you in a pleasant way. It's pretty cold in there so better to be layered up. Spend a couple of hrs strolling on its different levels and enjoy the natural beauty inside the dome!"
,,Wow. Just wow.,5.0,,"I've never seen anything like this. You have to see it for yourself. Walking in, the unique nature of the place just hits you and you'll be spellbound throughout! Enjoy it!"
,,unique educational and man made wonder,5.0,,"A MUST SEE FOR ALL
This is a unique experience ! An altitude forest with a waterfall. I found it to be a educational journey.
First of all its reasonably priced and you can combine it with the other nearby attraction or alone. It probably is an hour of my time.

Its a nice walk to the cloud forest through various gardens and bridges which is very scenic. The gardens by the bay is nice.

You start at the top of the waterfall and the follow a interesting path down seeig different plant life that would inhabit hi altitude with information along the way. As you come down the plant life changes and u see different angles of the waterfall and the ""mountain side""

I saw many children enjoying and couples and various ages. As you come to the bottom Theres a factual area a bit like a mini museum dedicated to environmental stats and a fantastic video. It really highlights how we are affecting the planet negitavely and is a massive eye opener.

I think kids will benefit as they are the generations that will make the changes in years to come.
It had a great section showing how the whole area of the gardens by the bay and cloud forest is sustainable showing we can make changes for a better future.

I think this is something everybody needs to see to create awareness of what we are doing to our planet and that we all can act and make changes.

Probably the number one thing i suggest every one do in singapore. An attraction like no other. Fantastic work to create it and sustain and educate us"
,,A little piece of paradise,5.0,,Every nook and cranny is crammed with something to see and inspire .. Really cool and thoroughly enjoyable. The rest of the gardens are great but pay the extra and visit this brilliant ecologically friendly marvel.
,,It's Cool!,5.0,,"It is literally cool. The temperature in the Cloud Forest is a welcome relief after the heat outside, but the plants and water make the time you spend in here combined with the amazing architecture so worthwhile - not expensive either"
,,magical,5.0,,bought my cousins here from the US and we had a great time! it was a magical place. Everything was lovely and we were happy that we didn't miss the opportunity to come here. Already planned to come back here next month with my gf!
,,SOOO GORGEOUS,5.0,,"Beautiful, stunning, gorgeous!!!! This was such an awesome experience. The architecture, effort and artistic creativity that must have gone into this amazing creation is unimaginable!!!! It was so pretty. Must visit!!!"
,,Tourism,4.0,,"Cool place imitating natural location, with skywalks and nice waterfall. Definitely a different experience, enjoyed a lot..."
,,Beautiful rain forest,4.0,,"Visited recently, decent attraction near marina bay sands particularly for keeping children occupied, should club together with other nearby marina bay attractions."
,,Very cooling and fairly decent views from up high,4.0,,"We enjoyed this attraction more than the Flower Dome.

First, there were a lot less people here in the Cloud Forest. There was more space for my daughter to roam around and for us to take in the sights at a more leisurely pace.

It is a bit cooler so do make sure you add an extra layer of clothing for the younger ones. I was fine with just a t-shirt throughout.

I liked the elevated pathways which provided me with different views of the waterfall and outside the dome itself. Perhaps an area of improvement would be to add on more interesting things to do/see within the Cloud Forest.

I guess I would not consider the Cloud Forest as a destination attraction, i.e. making the trip just to see the Cloud Forest. However it does fit in nicely if you were to be at Gardens by the Bay. You can then spend half a day at the Gardens, the Cloud Forest, followed by a short walk to the Marina Barrage to enjoy the open space, and end things off with a meal at Satay by the Bay."
,,Worth an hour or two,5.0,,Well worth exploring the cloud forest. A welcome change from the Singapore heat. Interesting variety of plants and landscaping.
,,Best thing here,5.0,,The forest is great just watch out to not get wet. If only it was possible to see it without a Dome then would be great
,,large domed garden,4.0,,the gardens are enclosed in a dome with many varieties of plants and water falls. It was good to take the elevator to the top and wander down the various levels viewing the unique arrangements.
,,Awesome indoor waterfall,5.0,,A very well conceived and presented attraction from the entry by the foot of the waterfall to the reflecting pool 6 stories up. The plant displays and information were excellent and there was a very informative video +5 degrees on global warming. The hanging walkways added to the drama.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"Visiting Cloud Forest is in my opinion a must when in Singapore, as it is as impressive as it is unique.

Words can't really do the Cloud Forest justice. The wow factor is definitely there! Strolling along the Cloud Walk (skywalk bridge) surrounded by the mist is a great experience.

Admission fee is 33 SGD for adults, which also gives you access to the nearby Flower Dome. If you plan to visit both you should have your hands full for the next 3-5 hours.

Tips:
If possible, try timing your visit so you can experience one of the mist timings, which start at 10am (lasts for 15-20 minutes) and then every second hour throughout the day.
I would recommend purchasing tickets online and then just bring a printout with you when visiting the Cloud Forest, just to avoid any queues at the ticket office.
Temperatures within Cloud Forest is between 23 to 25 degrees Celsius which feels a bit cold if you've already spent most of the day outdoors, so those who chill easilly might want to bring some extra to wear."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"The waterfall is amazing, you can find many species of flowers and tropical plants in Cloud Forest Gardens by the Bay. Great place for photo hunting!"
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,"In this forest we can see most famous trees and plants, The plants and trees are growing by artificial environment. Everyone must visit this cloud forest."
,,Amazing heaven,5.0,,Amazing temperature. ..artificial mountain and mist. It's more colourful at night. Best to visit in evening to cover the day time view and night time view in one go..
,,Beautiful and well worth a visit,5.0,,"I've been living in Singapore for over 2 years now but just visited with overseas family for the first time. The Cloud Forest dome at Gardens by the bay was well worth it. More spectacular and beautiful than the other dome. Climbing up the ""mountain"" and seeing the view of the gardens and the Singapore harbor was quite entertaining, and somewhat educational as well. Well worth the visit."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,this place is great to come and walk around in some peice and quiet wile enjoying the sounds of the waterfall and the cool misty air. do bring a sweater since it is chilly. also a towel you might get wet LOL
,,Spectacular and amazing!,4.0,,"The detail that has gone into making the Cloud Forest a success is amazing! Beautifully arranged shrubs, plants and trees, interspersed with flowers that do not normally bloom in the tropical climate, makes for an awesome sight to behold! Great maze of small alleyways that lead to different corners ... Well worth the visit up to the top of the cloud. This is a most enjoyable place for all members of the family to visit."
,,Family outing,4.0,,"This is a lovely forest in the Gardens by the Bay. A visit with our visiting family members made the tour worthwhile. It was not cheap but our relatives enjoyed themselves and since it is located in the Gardens by the Bay and there are also many ""free"" attractions outside made the visit even more worthwhile."
,,Nice indoor experience with vaious species of tropical plants,4.0,,It's pretty cold inside especially at the waterfall side. Remember to bring a jacket or wind breaker with you .
,,man-made wonder (Nature lover would be better off at the nature made park),4.0,,"The most common complain (or negative comment) people have on this site is ""These two dome are so small, I would be better off at natural park/reserve"". While I can't disagree with this comment, I must remind people that this is not a natural site and the whole thing is man-made.

The planning and design are well executed that you don't feel it's man-made and there's little sense of faking."
,,Fresh,5.0,,The smell of freshness is this place. The flowing water as you enter sets the tone for the whole experience. You walk above the view you see in the falls and really get to experience a mountain area. You also see the Bay from a high view you can take some great photos. You also get a jungle element as you walk on the lower levels. Worth you time and money
,,incredible,5.0,,"an indoor botanical garden that even comes with a waterfall, a great place to escape from the heat in the middle of the day. worth visiting!"
,,An amazing design,5.0,,We loved wandering through here - so cool and interesting (as in AC!) and such a lovely experience. Another incredible design and very peaceful. Don't go in the weekends as everyone in Singapore does!
,,Cold but nice,5.0,,- felt like walking in a mist forest - don't forget a jacket or scarf as it can be a bit chilled - not recommended if you don't like wet and moist place
,,Super,5.0,,Cool and relax place for the entire family. Brought friends from overseas here and they love it. Can spend the whole day inside because it's very cooling .
,,best thing to see,5.0,,such a small country and can do magic like this. this is nature created artificaly and very good to see and feel.
,,high bridge and crystals,3.0,,"The structure was very good but the attraction was just average. There's a big waterfall when you enter then take the lift to go up. Then, you'll see the what crystal caves are made of then go to throught the bridge. The walk on the bridge was kinda fun."
,,The coolest indoor airconditioned man made waterfall,4.0,,Great for getting out of the hot sun and a fast way to cool off. Its like walking through Jurrassic park
,,spectacular view,5.0,,you have to see it for yourself!! the waterfall [rainforest] was as real and it was really cold inside =)
,,An amazing place to walk around,5.0,,The waterfalls is amazing and the heights of the place is awesome. PRobably the best tourist spot in Singapore.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"The water fall, the sheer size of the structure is awestruck.. there is a video show about climate change near the exit. It's projected on the wall as well as on the floor to give a totally different feeling. Per show is of 5-10 minutes ,so do c it."
,,Worth seeing,5.0,,"If you are a botanic lover this is a place to visit. Misty forest with beautiful plant rising to the sky. Really refreshing, after a walk in the Gardens."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,Another spectacular display of flowers. The waterfall was sensational. The display of rocks and the educational information provided through out the display was excellent.
,,Amazing and entertaining,5.0,,It was surprising but so interesting and well done. The details and sculptures were fascinating and kept us looking around for the next wonder.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Worth a visit. The dome is $8 to enter. You can purchase a ticket at the gate. Its so beautiful. And the dome is airconditioned.
,,Takes your breath away!,5.0,,"I'm a Singaporean with young family and were quite pleasantly thrilled by the variety of plant species, visit during summer and escape the mercurial highs by hiding inside with a great book. Kids would love the waterfall."
,,Immerse Yourself,3.0,,This attraction really requires about 3 hours of time to fully visit...there are a lot of stuff to see...but the highlight for me was the waterfall!!
,,Great experience,5.0,,"This place is worth the money and time to visit. It's a great place to spend sometime to get out of the heat. Amazing waterfall and the cooling breeze that hits you as you walk in.
The tree top walk is fantastic and the way they have put craving into the gardens as well."
,,Well Worth the Experience,5.0,,"This is definitely a must see if you happen to have a couple of days in Singapore. Actually, the whole Gardens by the Bay is a must see, but the last time I was here I ended up not having enough time to come here, so I made it an imperative this time. It is basically an indoor tropical eco system. There is a huge rock mountain covered in trees and you can go up to the top level and walk on balconies that jut out across the forest. There is also a crystal palace inside with what look like crystaline structures - though I am not sure if the 'no touching' is because they are delicate, or they are fake - I'll go with the delicate."
,,Spectacular waterfall and planting,4.0,,We were warned to wear rain jackets while entering by the waterfall and were glad of them. The top walking path is not for the fainthearted who have a fear of heights!
,,It was a great experience,4.0,,I was amazed with how they created such an incredible artificial rainforest with all the high falls and real ferns that makes the place a real forest. I give credits to the intelligent people who made this possible. Very nice work of art!
,,"It's nice, but... go next door for more interesting things in the Flower Dome",3.0,,"I like the Cloud Forest, but I don't find it that interesting. Yes, it's a cool respite from the Singaporean heat, but it is not laid out in a way that really instructs about the different types of ferns, plants, etc. It is very monotonous in that sense. Much more interesting to go next door to the Flower Dome."
,,"A truly amazing walk, descending from the topmost layer to the forest floor",5.0,,"A cool way to spend your time amidst tropical greenery. A lift takes you to the topmost layer of the forest and you walk at your own pace along a well planned downward route, with many photogenic spots. To avoid the crowds, plan your visit on weekdays. You would get better pictures and be able to really soak in the spectacular views, whilst pausing along the trail. No pesky bugs or leeches."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"I believe you can only see this kind of attraction in Singapore. You can complete the whole tour for 30 minutes, then you can proceed in flower dome. Better go here at 4-5 pm so you can still see the garden in daylight and after you can just proceed to the light show in the super tree"
,,A must for all visitors to Singapore.,5.0,,"A great place to go to avoid the Singapore heat.Amazing array of many different flowers and pants, interesting to see how some plants from your home garden can be grown successfully in a different environment.Many plants to see and admire , however, I would not recommend this for children."
,,Fantastic Display,5.0,,Loved the Cloud forest. It is so cool wandering through the exhibit. The flora is extensive and the views are wonderful.
,,Joegrog,4.0,,Having just come from daintree rain forest in Queensland it was a treat to see the magnificent effort to replicate it and other forest environments.A must see a feast for the senses and great value The grog
,,Do not miss this unique experience,5.0,,A wonderful few hours in a cool dome looking at unique flowers and plants mounted on vertical walls amongst a waterfall ! ENJOY.
,,Very comfortable strolling inside this dome.,5.0,,"I am not a plant or flower person i just went there out of curiosity also because i have a visitor in town at the time. The following are my likes about this place:

My likes:
1- lifts for the elderly/pram/strollers only ;within the dome, is strictly enforced. i was impressed

2- we were welcome by the waterfall

3- like the temperature within the dome so it was very comfortable and nice to stroll around

4- There were water fountains near the toilet for one to fill up one's water bottle

5 appreciate the architectural dome

Tips: we bought our tickets from Cebu Travel which comes with tickets for a Singapore River Boat tour, which we feel was better value than buying the tickets onsite.

When you arrive, you would see Garden By The Bay offers its Shuttle service for $3 which was unlimited ;to and back,personally, if you are mobile, you would not need it. If you took this ride you would find yourself missing out the opportunity to take great pictures along your way to the Dome.You might also find yourself using this service ones only even though it offers unlimited rides. We bought this service only because we had a senior citizen with us at the time."
,,Preferred the flower dome,4.0,,The flower dome. Next to the cloud forest is much nicer. The place is generally like you would expect a rainforest to be a little unkept and untidy. But overall a great experience
,,WOW,5.0,,"My wife is a very keen gardener, me not so much but this trip to Singapore was because I wanted to take her to the garden, I knew she would love it. We both loved it, absolutely beautiful. As well as an amazing feat of engineering. When they do something in Singapore they do it on a grand scale."
,,Best man-made forest,5.0,,"I thought it would be another flower display inside a very impressive glass building. Well what a surprize. This is breathtakingly well designed, beautiful and so relaxing to walk through this amazing forest. The waterfalls is a stunner!"
,,cool conservatory with nice view,5.0,,"Greeted by a waterfall and cool wind, the cloud forest showcases the fauna and flora from the different layers in the forest from canopy to ground via bridges that spirals down the area. great view of singapore skyline as well!"
,,"Misty , cloudy and wonderful",5.0,,"As you enter ,you are welcomed by s majestic waterfall and that I guess is enough. You can spend all your time there with fresh gusts of water hitting your face. Now if you really want to go and discover other parts then get on the lift and go to level 6. From there you walk down various floors on a sky walk and you encounter some memorable things like the lost world and tree top walk. There is a special platform on level 5 to enjoy the waterfall from close quarters. Crystal mountain and the secret garden in the end are simple mind blowing. Your phone will run out of battery clicking. Buy ticket along with flowerdome but I liked this better than the dome"
,,Cool in more ways than one,5.0,,Impressive plants and information in a cool architectural dome. Make sure you time your visit when they mist the plants for an extra effect.
,,A must go,4.0,,"When you step out of the heat of the Singapore day into the cloud forest it is worth the entry fee alone. It is cool refreshing and stunning.

My family enjoyed walking around for the 45 minutes re so that it takes.

After a hot walk across the gardens this was to perfect place to beat the heat. The entry ticket for non Singaporeans has to be for this and the flower garden, the cloud forest is much better and more interesting unless you are a real flower buff.

,,Head in the clouds,5.0,,A pure feat of man and lesson in biodiversity and sustainability. Absolutely breathtaking and awesome. A must-do experience in Singapore.
,,A nice refuge from the heat,5.0,,"Beautiful airconditioned gardens within the Gardens by the Bay. There are seven different levels to explore, each with a different theme. A beautiful view of Singapore."
,,Serenity,5.0,,Cloud Forest was such a wonderful visit. It allowed us to cool down in the scorching heat and we were in aww once we walked in. Really liked how they design it you walk through the path and can see everything in the Dome...photos from top down or bottom up are all interesting!
,,Awsom experience,5.0,,Cloud forest was d best i found!that climate and d view !uffff!!!was amazing !was very realistic !thank u singapore fr cherishing those memories
,,Best,5.0,,"Best part of our visit hands down. It is very informational, has a long walk up a hollow mountain including a canopy walk. It is cool inside with misters everywhere and fake caves. Even an informational video on global warming inside very awesome. Kind of got lost,inside at times was the only downfall."
,,OMG,5.0,,This is part of Gardens By the Bay. We buy all our tickets in China Town as a bundle deal. This indoor garden is SPECTACULAR!
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,The arrangements of plants are wonderful and can be seen from many points of view using walkways at different height. A good way to cool down during a hot afternoon.
,,Ohhhhh my god,5.0,,This man-made super structure is just something out of this world takes you back to the Amazon rain forest plans I'm never seen before don't forget to bring a jacket you might get a little bit cold with the waterfalls on the air condition well keept super nice
,,Awestruck!,5.0,,"Definitely should be number 1 on all tourists list! If the weather is good, there's no need to take the tram but if it's a hot day, spend the money on it!"
,,Wow!,5.0,,This is in the gardens by the bay. I would recommend you take the whole day to explore this wonderful attraction. And get there early to beat the crowds. I would also recommend taking a light long sleeved top if you feel the cold as once inside it's quite crisp!
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Tropical dome with some spectacular views over several floors. You feel that you are in the mountains and viewing rare flora and fauna. It was well worth the trip. The video at the end provides food for thought.
,,So surreal,5.0,,"A waterfall, this place has a waterfall! Now I won't even lie a little bit the view from the ground is beautiful but from the sky walk is just an out of this world experience. I am terrified of heights, but I just had to talk the walk in the clouds and it was amazing!!! My 8 year old daughter loved this place and never wanted to leave!"
,,Amazing .. just out of the world,5.0,,A must must visit .. when in Singapore ! Kids will love it ! be ready for walking in the clouds.. the chill inside the forest !
,,Nice and Cool. Sit and Relax.,5.0,,"Just sit down, and enjoy the grand view of beautiful flowers in this special climate specifically to keep the plants healthy and natural.
You'll love the view if you head up the top. Otherwise, it's a really great experience to be inside, while the heat beats down on the people outside."
,,Feeling like being in the Alps Mountains,5.0,,"coole and breezy air, a bit foggy and nice arrengment of flowers and plants. In between Crystals and good Information of the nature and what are the factors to have a negative effect on our world and nature (e.g. global warming)"
,,Great idea for a visit,5.0,,Well designed with immaculate flower beds and an awesome waterfall. Always a fixture on our agenda when hosting foreign visitors
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Part of Gardens by the Bay...stunning architecture and nature presentation. A must see for any trip to Singapore...and air-conditioned (actually a bit chilly...so welcome!)
,,Absolutely amazing!,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must go place if you are in Singapore. It is not just a place to see thousands of exotic plants, it's like visiting an art gallery."
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"While it is artificially created environment for the cloud forest, it is an amazing experience with lots of plants and ferms and flowers. The dome is also a work of art in itself!"
,,Favorite location at Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"This was my favorite location at the Gardens by the Bay. The waterfall is impressive, and there's a lot to learn about what lives and grows at different heights."
,,Amazing- GO!,5.0,,"Just wonderful. It was simply amazing to wander through, beautiful and peaceful. So incredible the design and planning that have created this."
,,A must visit at the Garden by the Bay,5.0,,"amazing place, huge greenhouse, best of all its air-conditioned! wide varieties of rainforest plant species. a must see attraction!"
,,biodeversity at its best,5.0,,the very fact that it has been put together is a matter of awe and that too with such attention to detail...
,,Breathtakingly spectacular!,5.0,,"We were glad that we did the Flower Dome first as were blown away upon entering into the Cloud Forrest and seeing that waterfall! I think not really knowing what to expect (hadn't done any research on the Gardens before we turned up there) made it even more spectacular. Loved the garden of Lego and the winding pathway that literally took us up into the clouds! Just a wonder to look around.

We walked past the crystal garden quickly, as well as all of the info at the bottom as didn't really interest us."
,,An amazing place!,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit if you enjoy plants and flowers. It is in an unusual dome structure, and the displays are well-done. As an added bonus, it is quite cool inside, which was a welcome relief from Singapore's heat."
,,Awesome.,5.0,,Must go. Don't just miss it. You will never get this exp anywhere else. Overall complete garden by bay is diff and nice experience.
,,Quite amazing.,4.0,,"Within the botanic garden area you can find the Cloud Forest bio dome. Imagine a high altitude rainforest - well that is what you will get. A tower rises within it to great heights. Catching a lift up, we walked down a ramp which overlooks the complex as well as gives incredible views out to sea and over the Marina Bay Area. There is also a waterfall. Lovely."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Nice place to walk around&sight seeing. Waited for the cloud turned out to be just small mist only, expected more though."
,,I was absolutely blown away!,5.0,,"The second we entered the cloud forest and saw the waterfall we were absolutely blown away! Honestly - WOW!! The concept of this is design is fantastic! The flowers, the greenery, the colours all just come alive. The views of the outside from inside are fantastic as well. A must visit for all ages. Cheap $8 entry for adults. Allow plenty of time as we spent 1.5 hours in here. An absolute highlight of Singapore for me! It's like nothing I have ever seen, especially in the middle of a big city!"
,,An Amazing Place to Visit,4.0,,"The Dome reminded me of the TV series called Under the Dome. Its a nice scenic man made environment created. It more of a wonder when we look at the waterfall and the greenery around.

The atmosphere is very sci-fi. The bridge walk is great. A grea place to takes pictures. The crystal mountains are ok, however the natural ones are great if you are able to visit some natural caves such as Jenolan Caves in NSW, Australia."
,,A rainforest in central Singapore - although a little pricey!,4.0,,"The cloud forest was a nice place to visit to see a rainforest in the middle of Singapore but it's not a 'i'll return' type of venue. It was very refreshing (climate wise) with some wonderful wooden sculptures but it is rather pricey for what effectively takes no more than 30 minutes to walk around and see it all. It's more about the rainforest elements than flowers or things like that.

If you're not a fan of heights I'd probably avoid this given some of the walkways wouldn't agree with you.

Overall it was quite nice and good to see once but a sharper price for tourists visiting would make it more attractive and a possible return venue on future visits."
,,Cloud Forest.,4.0,,One of the best place. We thoroughly enjoyed the cloud walking. Well maintained and easy to go around.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"An amazing place to visit, but take a light jacket as it does get cold inside. The displays are fantastic. We were intrigued to see the gardeners hanging from ropes to do the manicuring of the displays. Well worth a visit."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Incredible foresight to create one of the amazing things to see in Singapore. Even teenage kids were in awe of everything.
,,Singapore stopover,5.0,,"2 day stopover, this is a must do....absolutely amazing, lots to take in and to experience, highly recommend......pls dont miss out !!!"
,,Impressive but has a very sterile feel,4.0,,Very impressive structure with amazing plants etc. Sculptures located amongst the plants were fantastic. But feels a bit strange as no smell or insect life at all. Worth a visit
,,"Beautiful, Peaceful and many hidden gems",5.0,,First impression is very deceptive. But many more gems are hidden are you investigate the Forest! Make sure you Buy tickets to both conservatoriums
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Stunning and so worth the cost of entry. Arrive early but stay for dark! Lots to look at and easy access.
,,Very well constructed!!!,5.0,,"Just like a wonder! This place very beautiful and worth visit for all age groups. They have created a huge waterfall and mountain inside glass dome around which there is an arrangement to walk on trails from top to the base. Temperature of dome is low as you can feel literally cold inside, so if you are having kids with you, you might want to have some warm wears for them. The attraction gives you a feel of being on a hill station.
It is better to reach this place by taxi which is very convenient but you can also approach by some long walk from Bayfront MRT. Worth visiting place, and if you buy a package with additional tours of Singapore, you might save some dollars as ticket price is at bit expensive side."
,,Best area in Garden by the Bay,5.0,,Super cool. Man-made waterfall was breathtaking :-) Super love the hanging bridges - but was a little bit scary for my mom. ensure that you buy tickets at the airpot for great packages :-)
,,Worth a visit...,4.0,,Located in gardens by the bay... just do not miss this artificial waterfall cum cloud forest region... one of the cool place in hot singapore...
,,Awesome place,5.0,,The Cloud Forest at the garden Boyne bay was awesome. Really cool place ver well set out they have a skywalk it all awesome well worth the visit. Nice and cold inside
,,A must Visit,4.0,,the cloud forest has been designed perfectly.. u will feel a cold inside . the waterfall has been made nicely
,,"Brilliant Idea, well done",5.0,,"Loved the domes, we did them on dusk and the mist from the waterfall was great. This is a great place to visit if raining or too hot outside."
,,Air Conditioned Gardens!,5.0,,"As soon as you walk in the doors, you will hear the thundering waterfall & be cooled by the mist - a soothing contrast to the heat & humidity outside! Everything is lush & green, plants & trees appropriately labeled. The walking grounds are even & well-marked. There is a set of elevators for those who need it to get to the top ""floor"" where the waterfalls begin. It is easier to shoot videos here because of the height/elevation if it is not too crowded."
,,Better choice than the flower dome,4.0,,"If you have to buy two tickets for both domes and time is tight, make sure you spend more time here. It is dramatic, and the skywalks are so exciting."
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,Brilliant and amazing place. Super worth he money. .if u r on EP u get local resident rate....me and wife enjoyed the waterfall ..the mist..the flowers..simply wow
,,Do it in daylight,4.0,,"We did the gardens by the bay early evening and then went to Cloud Forest , by this time it was dark and we really couldn't enjoy it much."
,,Very unusual and well worth a visit,5.0,,"So this is in Marina Bay Gardens, one of two domes, and this one has within in, a cloud forest, literally! The plants and atmospheric conditions created are amazing and as you walk up the forest (in a kind of spiral to the top) you discover more and more. It's also a great way to cool down!"
,,Out of this world,5.0,,"We had a great experience, right from the entrance with the huge water fall to the different types of plants and trees, which can survive only in a moist climate."
,,Impressive,5.0,,This is a must see - my favourite day in Singapore . Enjoyed every aspect of Gardens by the Sea. The chilli crabs in the foodmarket is also well priced.
,,Unique and one of its kind Forest!,4.0,,"Right outside the ""Marina Bay"" MRT is the cloud forest dome a part of ""gardens by the bay"". i visited during the night and was in awe as soon as I entered. This manmade attraction has a misty feel as soon as you enter with a huge waterfall. You will need to walk through the bridges that act as canopies and look fantastic.

Doing this activity in the daylight might be better as you will have natural daylight though the glass architecture. I did it in the night in artificial lights which was also fine but feel natural daylight would do more justice to this."
,,amazing!,5.0,,This is an amazing and beautiful place to visit. I would recommend to anyone to go. The canopy is incredible and the Singaporeans have done an amazing job in what they have created.
,,The amazing architecture!,5.0,,I went there yesterday and I felt absolutely amazed by the beautiful nature & wonderful architecture! I really felt the smell of the jungle plants & the beauty of nature! It's a must go!
,,Cool forest,5.0,,"Once you step in, you will be awed. The huge man made waterfall and all the bridges acting as canopies were definitely something. This is a good option for rainy day. Take your time and enjoy the journey."
,,A five story rain forest in a bottle,5.0,,"It's hard to describe how amazing cloud forest is in a simple review, it has to be experienced to be believed. It's not only the best attraction in Singapore (along with the Gardens and flower dome) but probably one of the best I have visited in the world. It's a five story rain forest in a green house. Now stop and think about that. A rain forest, five stories high in a building with walkways that allow you to admire it from different heights and angles. For the full effect visit during the day then return at night and see it all light up. If you can do this at misting time it's even better. When we live on Mars, it will be in buildings like this."
,,First Man Made Indoor Forest | highly recommended,5.0,,"The start towards the inside of Cloud Forest was so pleasent with cold breeze coming in from the scotching heat outside and indoor waterfall just makes you feel lost to the nature again.
Audio Tour (various language) is recommended for the nature wanderer and explorer as there are many many types of tree, plants, hubs, bushes ... that you really might wonder if they really exists.
They have beautifully managed it to the core I must say that.

The stone artifacts are also eye catchy and wonderful for historic people to look upon.

And at the indoor presentation house presenting what would happen if we don't stop cutting them off and how this big cloud forest is run without any external energy to run the airconditioner and waterfall is just unbelievable.

Strongly recommend"
,,Mesmerizing experience,5.0,,"This is must among all the attractions at Garden by the Bay. It replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical regions. They have about 6 floors, depicting the cold environment at top (cloud, mist) - small plants, ferns and gradually coming to trees at the bottom.
Its a nice educational tour for botanical students or school going children."
,,Engineering and architectural delight,5.0,,"Visually impressive with a wonderful collection of plants - the information, seemingly aimed at school children, could be supplemented by more adult/scientific content"
,,oasis in the city,5.0,,"the waterfall is an beautiful sight and sets the tone for the visit to cloud forest...located at the entrance of the dome, one cannot imagine a sight like this in the middle of a city. The walk up the man made hill, the variety of species from plant kingdom, the salt formations of caves and finally the view from the top.... all make it a must visit destination in Singapore"
,,An amazing place to visit,5.0,,"The is a marvel to visit when visiting Singapore. The engineering to create this place is amazing. It is also amazing when you have been walking around outside in the humidity and then go inside this place, and it is wonderfully cool. There is great eateries and not far from the city of Singapore."
,,What an amazing indoor waterfall.,5.0,,Photos cannot do this waterfall justice and as usual for Singapore the science behind the beauty is astounding. I could just stand in here and breathe the fresh air all day as you wouldnt believe that you are in such a major city with the smell of the fresh air.
,,Enchanting walk,4.0,,"Really wonderful walk to see the foliage from Costa Rica. It's an easy walk, but if you're afraid of heights, you may want to give this one a miss as the highlight for this dome would be the wired walking paths (where you can see right down below you). Definitely my favourite would be the 7th floor where you can see different varieties of Venus Flytraps! Great attraction for all ages, and best to go in the afternoon to get a break from the heat and humidity of Singapore!"
,,Refreshing,5.0,,A place to be when u want to feel relaxed and cooling in a hot day.the waterfall simply beautiful.the plants are also beautiful and interesting too.Not ur average kind of plants u see every day. It's a good place to be in when visiting Singapore and it has various types of exhibition held there too.A must visit place when in Singapore I must say.:)
,,How could you not be impressed,5.0,,Another of Singapore's amazing facilities. We were very happy with our stroll around and loved the novelty of it all.
,,Enclosed Forest in the City,4.0,,"After finishing the Flower dome, we entered the Cloud Forest Dome and was immediately treated to a Waterfall view. This forested park is like a scene in a futuristic movie scene. as you walk along, there are plenty of educational signs & boards which can relay a lot of knowledge. I will recommend this as a MUST VISIT site."
,,Very Nice and oh so cool....,4.0,,This is one of the two domed gardens at the Gardens by the Bay. It is wet and cool - the perfect break from Singapore in July.
,,One of my favorites,4.0,,"This was my favorite of the places in Gardens by the Bay. It is interesting with very good descriptions and scientific presentations. You also get to to to the top of the ""mountain"" and walk down. It is an amazing structure. And it is cool!!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We loved this place. Absolutely beautiful plants and incredible sculptures. Also a very welcome reprieve from the heat. Went on a Tuesday morning and it wasn't too busy, very easy to see everything."
,,A must see,5.0,,"A beautiful man made oasis in the centre of a bustling city. For maximum enjoyment do it at night as the light show adds a brand new dimension.

IMHO if you can only do either the Flower Dome or this one definitely skip the Flower Dome

No doubt this is a jewel in the crown for Singapore and a must see."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore...part of Gardens by the Bay. Easily accessible by MRT. Need atleast 1.5 hrs to see it well. You can also visit the Flower Gardens and watch the light and sound show at 1945hrs. All close by to one another.
,,Wow,5.0,,"This place is really an eye opener. A huge air conditioned dome that is beautifully presented with an educational aspect to it. The size of the waterfall when you first enter the dome is impressive. I attended with 3 children under 10 who were equally impressed with the Cloud Forest.
Would recommend this to visitors of Singapore."
,,A must visit in Singapore !!!!,5.0,,Need to visit this place .. its really incredible and awesome. The way it is built and how it is managed is really really good. Especially the misty towers and the water falls... love it ..
,,Good place,4.0,,"Its a little different place. Good shelter in heat, little expensive, can avoid if you are on tight schedule or tight budget"
,,best cloud forest,4.0,,it is an awesome sight and the cloud florest is cooling and full of greenery..good to bring kids for them to enjoy and learn about the Ecosystem and plants and florestry.
,,A wheelchair challenge proved OK,4.0,,"We had visited the cloud forest before in 2014, but this time we had the challenge of pushing a wheelchair along so as not to leave anyone behind. However there was never a problem as the lifts take you to the top where you can enjoy some spectacular views of Singapore as you do a 360degree turn around the giant glass dome that is home to many varieties of plants and flowers and the constant mist that comes from the waterfall. We were impressed by how everything had grown from the time it was all put together, and the walkways proved no handicap for our wheelchair person who very much enjoyed the view, especially of the window cleaners hanging outside and cleaning the windows suspended 25 metres from the ground. They looked like they enjoyed it like we did."
,,Nature and man doing something amazing,5.0,,"This was a great couple of hours' spent wandering around this artificial mountain with waterfall, rainforest etc. Beautiful, exciting and educational all at once. Highly recommended. Is part of Gardens by the Bay, requires. Ticket but well worth it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great way to cool off the kids for a couple of hours. Taxis are cheap or the hop on and off bus is also an option
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,"Super amazing garden I've ever been in the middle of the city! I spent more than 2 hours in the garden and I didn't want to leave, very beautiful! The minimalist modern architecture and the flowers, make you feel you're in the movie scene, must visit when you're in spore!"
,,"When engineering meet botany, the impressive way of gardening display.",5.0,,"Explore the highlands amidst orchids, pitcher plants and ferns from the cool-moist Tropical Montane region, complete with a 35-metre man-made mountain and waterfall.
I love exploring every floor of the forest. The global warming projection is also powerful and emotional. This place completely blow my mind."
,,Nice Temperature,5.0,,Variety of plants in a chill temperature. I really like the idea of the cloud forest.. Every level has different variety and concept.
,,Super awesome forest!,5.0,,"It's really mesmerising, the waterfall is beautiful, the lego flower is shocking unpredictable yet really interesting. Each floor offers its own experience that worth to try."
,,Fabulous!,4.0,,"I visited the incredible gardens with a friend of mine while we were in Singapore on business recently. It had started off as trying to find something to do while killing time before our flights. It turned into much more than that . . .

You really need a whole morning or afternoon to see these gardens. They are seriously amazing. The ultra modern trees on steel frames with live vegetation growing over them. It is like visiting another planet or at least, being in the future. Surreal.
The Cloud Forest is particularly worth a visit. Go right to the tope on the aerial walkways and see clouds being formed and how they stimulate the vegetations growth.

You will not be disappointed."
,,Wonderfully cool,4.0,,We visited on our second evening here and as we were not quite acclimatised to the heat found it wonderfully refreshing. It was very busy and lots of slow movers with pushchairs on the walkways which made it very awkward to stop or look properly at the plants. I would recommend this attraction though as the views were fab as the sun went down.
,,Indoor botanic garden,3.0,,Good way to spend a few hours indoors and air conditioned. If you live in a country with vast green areas you probably wouldn't appreciate the two domes. The Cloud Forest has a lovely evaluated walking track and a rain forest feel.
,,Big waterfall,3.0,,"It was pleasant to not be in hot outside weather for a short time as this is cool temperature controlled.
Once you are at the top of the waterfall there is a little pond which is sweet. Then you start walking down and everything starts to look the same.
Wear flat shoes with sensible sole as there are wet puddles around from waterfall.
Wasn't keen on the stalactites and stalagmites exitbit but this may be because i have seen real and beautiful ones in caves."
,,Amazing attraction,5.0,,"The waterfall at the entry is amazing, then going up behind it you can look back to the city or the river. The plants are awesome, the whole place is ""climate controlled"" with humidity & air to make it a normal environment for the plants, it's just stunning, the cloud walk is amazing"
,,Sensational!,5.0,,"Breathtaking and innovative. What amazing place to visit. I loved it. It's indescribable!! A huge dome with a mountain like creation in the middle dripping with plants and botanicals as far as the eye can see. If this isn't incredible enough, you can walk round the mountain on a series of metal walkways to capture a cloud like misty experience."
,,Must visit with the Gardens.,5.0,,This is next to the Gardens by the Bay and is a good place to visit and spend a couple of hours. The main attraction is the waterfalls. It is a notch below the gardens but still and must see attraction when you visit Singapore
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Great layout on different levels with good views from the top Lots of plants to see Educational value
,,"Disappointing, visit the botanic gardens instead",2.0,,"Although some really interesting species, the overall experience was pretty disappointing and under-whelming vs many other amazing attractions offered by the land of the red dot - sadly I won't be returning any time soon. Visit the botanical gardens if you can only choose one (and make sure you see the amazing orchid garden at the botanical gardens)."
,,A very good forest,5.0,,"A tropicanal country can have a such place. Amazing. Good to visit during afternoon. Dont worry coz it is cold inside the dome.
The car parking fees reasonable. Mcdonald is pack.
At the end of this forest, it has a video to ask the human to protect the earth."
,,Best Pravilion at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,We were plesantly surprised by this exhibit. It was better with than the flower dome. We liked the sky walks and other information in side. it was cool as well with the misty water
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"I just love how cold the weather is in this place. I know for a fact that the temperature inside is controlled, this is a good way to escape the hot temperature of SIngapore."
,,High Up,5.0,,"if you get cold easily, carry a regular jacket as the higher you go and the more amazed you get, it may get slightly cold too"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is spectacular with the waterfall as you enter. Worth going to the top for the views. Not good if you are scared of heights on the walkway. S $16 and worth every cent. Will definitely go again and recommend to anyone visiting Singapore.
,,Breathtaking experience!,5.0,,Cloud Forest is so beautiful it is breathtaking! Take a lift to the top of the dome and then come down the narrow ramps looking down at jungle of tropical plants and flowers. The waterfall is amazing!
,,Man made mountain with cantilevered bridges.,4.0,,"Being an architect this building always fascinated me. I visited this Cloud forest dome just to see the building from inside. Without much to expect about ''forest or clouds''. Apparently all the photographs of the place shows cloud formation at topmost level. I was not lucky enough to see or feel that. It's a 5-6 storey Mountain completely Man-Made clad with greens all around and water spouts throwing down the water falls from all the levels. as you enter you witness giant water fall. after you enter inside the mountain you have lifts and escalators to go up, with each level has cantilevered projections to see around the giant glass dome. One may visit this just to see, How far man can create/copy the nature."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"Cloud Forrest is a must see if in Singapore! Our kids (8, 6 & 5) loved it and did we. We spent half a day here and at the flower dome. It's lovely and cool inside too, which is a bonus."
,,Visit 2 times,3.0,,"Not quite amazing. Dont like fake Rafflesian flower, fake cave, fake waterfalls and fake mountain... my hometown is much more natural... but this place is offering clean, organized and disable-friendly place.."
,,Magical,5.0,,Best glass house ever! The waterfall infront of entrance was stunning! Better to visit at noon until dark so the light switch on.
,,Great learning experience.,5.0,,"I enjoyed the Cloud Forest very much because you got to see all kinds of plants, and they had many opportunities for you to learn more, as they had all sorts of information and a film regarding global warming. The waterfall kept the place humid and the sky walkway allowed you to tour the entire mountain, and it was all air-conditioned."
,,Honeymoon in Singapore,5.0,,"Very amazing, awesome place. This is a must visit in Singapore. You need atleast half a day to visit it completely."
,,Out of the world experiance,5.0,,"It was the highlight of my trip to Singapore. It simply blew me away and I am still mesmerized by its beauty. The waterfall, sky walk bridge and the different tropical plants add to its beauty."
,,A Mini Heaven on earth...,5.0,,"Fantastic place to go to when one is in Singapore. Takes you away from the hustle-bustle of the city and irrespective of whatever is the temperature outside, you will always have a pleasant weather in the cloud forest. Its a heavenly feeling."
,,A Must See Whilst In Singapore,5.0,,This is a definate place to see while you are in Singapore. The place is amazing and air-conditioned.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"After a hot, humid day walking around Singapore we decided to visit the gardens. The Cloud Forest is lovely and cool escape. You are misted with waterfall as you walk through the doors. We arrived at sunset so the darkness made it more dramatic. There are lots of beautiful plants and you can see a view of the city through the glass on the way to the top. One thing to note, this is pram/ disabled accessible however the lifts are tiny and take forever. Make sure you allow lots of time if you need lift access."
,,Wonderful place to spend a day !,5.0,,"The huge structure called Conservatory located on reclaimed land is within the city centre. There are two - Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Myriads of plants are found in the Dome, which simulates the tropical highlands. A 35-metre high ""waterfall"" sprays cool mist at the entrance is most welcoming. A leisurely walk to the top of the Cloud Forest is a must.
It's one of the most popular places to visit and suits practically everyone - from the very young to the teens to the elderly. Visitors should also visit the other Flower Dome which regularly displays flowers such as the recent displays of Lilies and Tulips.

Wonderful place to spend a day for the kids to wander up and around the two Domes, and leisurely strolls for the elderly in comfortable air-conditioned in hot and humid Singapore! It's an surprisingly oasis of sort!"
,,Great inside attraction,4.0,,"We visited with an open mind, but the displays of sculptures, in wood was as good as the plants there.
Worth a visit and good for a rainy day, you have to Ho upstairs yo buy an entrance ticket before you can gain entry, not available at the turnstiles.
There is a lift to the top so don't be put off by the height of the inside climb and there is a circular walkway to descend, a gentle slope and most folks walk down the centre, if you don't mind heights the edge gives a super view of the climbing plants and those below."
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,Our 7 and 9 year old absolutely loves this experience and so did we. What a magical place. It feels like you are in a rainforest. The variety of plant life and the colours of all the orchids and flowers is breathtaking. The waterfall makes it all a very special place.
,,What an experience,5.0,,"This is a MUST. What an experience. So many awesome memories from this place. Worth the S$18 each. A MUST for the ""to do"" list"
,,Excellent,5.0,,The plants and flowers here are great. Very educational. Enjoyed going to the top for the view too. A must see.
,,Mesmerizing,4.0,,"Can't really classify this as a nature-lovers attraction because it's artificial, but it's really well made and interesting. There are exhibitions inside that are very informative and even slightly disturbing (climate change warning). We've had a great time exploring the Cloud Forest. Not for people scared of heights!!"
,,Excellent way to spend one day in Singapore,5.0,,"That was a great experience for me, my wife and my 9 year old boys. The last is extremely valuable reference having in mind how difficult is something different than video game to attract and keep their attention for more than 15 minutes. Highly recommend to everyone who wished to spend a whole day out with the family and at same time to provide some extra education for all family members."
,,The most comfortable way to know tropical plants,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay have 2 conservatories and between the two the Cloud Forest is very unique in the way it presents tropical forest in a very comfortable environment. Although the best way is to go right into the jungles, nothing beats air conditioning in the sweltering heat."
,,Simple amazing!,4.0,,"I had never seen a place like this before. An artificial rain forest, a waterfall, and skywalk bridges on the top, everything was a refreshing and educational at the same time. Singapore is known for it man made architectures, and this one is the one making nature the backbone."
,,Wonderful!!!,5.0,,"Cloud forest in a glass house. Superbly built. The waterfall, the top floor, the walk way are simply amazing. At times when fine mists are being sprayed, you will feel like walking in the clouds. The tropical forest built in a glass house will give you some memorable moments and good clicks."
,,Family stroll,3.0,,"You will be greeted with the artificial waterfall when you enter. Similar to Flower Dome, inside can be quite cold to some folk.

It is quite crowded inside. There are long queue to take the lift up to the top of the waterfall. We took the stair. It wasn't too bad to take the stair to avoid the queue, we climb up 6th floor by stair as a form of exercise.

Not much activities up there except photo taking. For those who afraid of height, you might want to skip going up. On the way down, you will come across the stalagmite exhibit.

At the ground level, there are educational video on global warming which is suitable to teach and remind us not to waste energy!"
,,fantastic,5.0,,"Shade and coolness around, do not need more heat of Singapore. It is recommended to visit with children"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This really an amazing botanical reservation that really fun and natural although they build the environment but it looks so natural. Love it. This place is really romantic also if you want to have sunset view from cloud bridge.
,,Cool oasis in hot Singapore,5.0,,"I went here not once but twice recently. Your visit will start off with a bang because you'll go from hot Singapore, through some double doors and will be at the bottom of about a five-story-high waterfall. The mist and breeze will instantly cool you off. I'd venture to say that if you stayed there a while, you'd get downright cold. From the bottom you then take long, spiraling walkways to the top. It's extremely well done with something to see at every point. It's also designed so the top has plants and flowers found at much higher elevations.
I would try if possible to visit on somewhat off-peak times because the fewer the people, the more you'll feel like you are in a cool rainforest.
The only aspect I could do without is the brainwashing about man-made climate change in a theater at the base of the facility, despite lots of evidence that NASA and the UN have tampered with temperature data to arrive at their desired outcome. It's easy to skip the theater and just enjoy the amazing Cloud Forest plants, cool air, and impressive dome."
,,Nature meets modern architecture,5.0,,Beautiful place. They really capture the feel of being in a tropical rainforest. The architecture is amazing as well!
,,Nice cool adventure,3.0,,"While a little pricey it was a very nice adventure. The place has 7 levels; lvl 1 waterfall walk/gift shop, lvl 2-3 circular walk upward through the terraces, skips to lvl 6 a cloud walk extended from the structure, stairs up to lvl 7 the waterfall overlook, lvl 5 is a cavern crystal exhibit (stalagmites/stalactites/geodes plus another extended walking loop, and lvl 4 an environ conservation exhibit plus the 5+ Degree big screen show.

Definitely enjoyed the cooler temp after having hiked from the Shoppes at Marina."
,,Amazing Experience,4.0,,"It was an amazing experience to have first hand look of how it feels in a tropical forest.
Its lush green everywhere you see. It replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions all over the world.

We enjoyed both the domes but if you have an option to choose from one done then go for Flower dome as that dome is full of flowers all over the world."
,,Really Cool,5.0,,"We only had a short time to look around. It is very big and you should give yourself enough time to see all floors. It's really cool at night time, the waterfall lights up in different colors."
,,Cloud Forest in a glashouse.,5.0,,Another must see in Singapore part of the Gardens by The Bay. It does resemble being in a cloud with the fine mist being sprayed at times . There is a waterfall and you can take a walk up high well above the ground to view the extensive planting below. Many things to photograph as you walk around the extensive gardens.
,,Beautiful and educational,4.0,,"A little expensive for what it is, but made some memorable holiday photos as the waterfall is really beautiful. Also very educational so good place to take the kids."
,,Good display of artificial rain forest & waterfall,3.0,,"It has a central tall structure with waterfall flowing from top. Looks stunning at night (we wen at 7.30 pm) You can go up the central structure & enjoy walk around the artificial rain forest. The sky walk is hanging in mid air, to add to the trill."
,,You kind of have to buy both dome entrances but this has the wow factor unless you like Lilly's,4.0,,On entry you are met by the 7 story waterfall covered in greenery. You make your way up mainly by lift (steps at the end but lift for push chairs and wheel chairs) and then walk and escalator down. While the plants are a bit similar (rain forest green) it does have very calm feel. I'm my opinion the better of the two but no way as impressive as the Eden Project in Cornwall.
,,Beautiful and modern!,4.0,,It's a such experience in Singapore. Nothing compares... This is a simulated climate and environment of natural life in different altitudes. Don't forget your jacket. It's extreme cold inside
,,Greta reprieve from the Heat,5.0,,"Houses a greta trail around and behind the waterfall, depicting a tropical cloud forest. An excellent chance to relax and cool down, while enjoying the mountain forest."
,,The most interesting attraction at Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"We bought the standard ticket priced 28 dollar per adult for two conservatories. We first entered this Cloud Forest, and we were amazed with the design and the surrounding atmosphere. It was cool inside with interesting features of the forest. We were fascinated by the man-made waterfall located at the entrance of Cloud Forest. We spent about 1 hour here to take pictures and enjoyed the refreshing 'air' as the weather was hot outside the conservatories. They even have the Lego-made plants e.g. pitcher plant and Rafflesia. We thought this Cloud Forest is better than the Flower Dome."
,,Out of the world experience!! Must visit!,5.0,,"The best part of our Singapore trip was Cloud Forest. It was so cool and pleasant inside with the tallest man-made waterfall awaiting us!
The dome is huge has the most beautiful and rare plants and trees. The dome is over three floors. We can take a life to 3rd floor and then walk down along the bridge which has awesome views of the Marina Bay Sands, flyer and the bay. All along the bridge are the plants and trees. You can almost click pictures everywhere and anywhere! The waterfall is so pleasant you don't feel like leaving the dome."
,,The better dome,5.0,,"Awesome architecture, great climate .. Perfect spots for breathtaking pictures. I just wonder how the managed to exclude all real wildlife.. Not a single fly or other insects spotted. A bit over engineered the whole place."
,,Spectacular variety,5.0,,Nice and cool inside. Try to visit when the crowd is thin so that you get more time with the flora. The sky walk can be quite harrowing and not for the faint of heart.
,,A Different World!,5.0,,So beautiful! Well worth the visit to the gardens just for this! Make sure you head here last as this is by far the highlight!
,,"Wow, what a beautiful area of waterfall, plants Wow",5.0,,"There was always something different to look at in the Cloud Forest, from many different angles. They have the walkway that gives you a perpective of the structure with gorgeous plants/ferns/flowers. I was speechless at some of the most unusual plants/flowers. Walking was fine easy enough, using the distraction of what you can see. Memorable."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,"This was very well done and I loved all the beautiful flowers which for the most part were well labeled. It was so nice and cool, I really hated to leave. Loved the different levels which displayed the plants which would grow in different climates/altitudes. Well worth the price which was very reasonable."
,,exclusively nice,5.0,,A very nice cloud forest made inside the gardens of the bay. This cloud forest consists of few floors and you comes from top till the bottom and it really gives you lovely experience.
,,Holiday,5.0,,"Spectacular views, try to get there when the mist is active ... Very nice to see, maybe not geared for small children, if you can keep them still, try to do the canopy walk!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"First you get amazed by the waterfal, and then you get to walk among beautiful green ferns, orchirds and colorful flowers and wooden statues peak at you from within the greens. Truly a marvel!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is one incredible place to visit. After being out in the Singapore heat it was great to enter the cloud forest and be greeted by a 32 metre waterfall. The design is just amazing and to go to the top of the waterfall and walk down among plants and flowers is breathtaking. You also get great views of the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and Singapore as you do. A place to be enjoyed by all ages"
,,Great Place to Be,4.0,,"Is is cooling, try visit this place in the evening and you will enjoy the view and moment, the walk is nice .. tropical forest walk in the city"
,,The view from the walks were amazing,5.0,,Loved this dome the best!! So worth the money to go inside. The lift to the top was great and I loved the secret garden at the very top. The cat walks were scary but so beautiful and the forest itself was full of small but amazing flowers. Just superb
,,Water fall was great!,4.0,,"I was surprised that water fall was in the dome! But it was so chilly in side of the dome, so I will recommend that you should bring additional wear."
,,Must do,5.0,,"The cloud forest is awesome. Massive indoor waterfall. Wait until you get on the walkway, it is a long way up, but excellent."
,,FANTASTIC,5.0,,Must see - unique waterfall under the dome - fabulous - excellent for families - educational attraction
,,The must place to see when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"Must must go at least once. It is amazing how many cool plants could be well arranged and maintained in this one big dome. I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. I thought that I would get bored after 10 mins. But we ended up walking around taking photos for over 2 hours.

Not sure though if I would go back on my own. But for sure I would add this as one of the stops for friends and families visiting us. :)"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Fantastic world, especially at evening with all the lights on. Prices are different, lower for the residents, higher for the tourists. Per total, great experience !!!"
,,CLOUD FOREST - THE CRYSTAL MOUNTAINS.,4.0,,One of those exceptional things to watch in the world of tourism. Good to see for those who love nature and greenery.
,,Singapore's top attraction: Do not miss this one,5.0,,"I covered this in my review of Gardens by the Bay, where this is the leading attraction. We spent over an hour, enjoying the scenery on the man-made mountain, the many wooden statues (often rather subtle, adding tot heir attraction),and the amazing diversity of plants arranged in interesting combinations. An absolute masterpiee of landscape design."
,,Interesting if you like plants.,4.0,,I did feel a little like I was in a good quality garden centre. That however could be just that I am not an avid gardener but I will agree it looked lovely.
,,Water everywhere,5.0,,"This Dome was spectacular,the views,flowers and the waterfall was really something to see,easy to walk around and had great views of the fall at different angles."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Really enjoyed this indoor man made mountain and waterfall. The walkway route that takes you up then back down is great, you actually feel like you're in the clouds!"
,,Rainfall nice to see / take pictures,3.0,,"The big rainfall in the Cloud Forest is the nicest part of the Gardens by the Bay. I would not say it's a must see, but this is a very nice place to walk around on a hot day (as there is aircon in the huge glasshouse) or on a rainy day."
,,Stunning set up worth the visit,4.0,,A lovely time to leisurely enjoy a walk in a beautiful setting certainly worth the visit and also the layout helps you appreciate the whole atmosphere
,,Cool and Beautiful,5.0,,On entering you see a 6 storey waterfall adorned by plants stretching the whole height. A wonderful respite to the outside heat. After walking around the floor area of gardens a lift takes you to the 6th floor where you gradually walk down a circular walking path to the bottom. Great views over Marina Bay plus the plant variety beautiful.
,,You Have to See This to Believe It!!,5.0,,This amazing climb up a mountain with a waterfall inside a dome is the most awesome thing! Can't describe it properly except to say it's very much worth the fee. Would go again in a heartbeat!! Must see!!
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,"We had a Great day out for the whole family. The two main Domes the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest were Good, but the Cloud walkway and the Waterfall were Amazing. The Light and Sound Show at the Supertree groove is the Best of all."
,,Wow greenhouse,4.0,,"This is amazing. Much bigger than you think. The waterfall is not massive, but still nice. The plants are really wow. I am sure you see some you have not seen before."
,,Ascend to the clouds,5.0,,Cloud forest plants under the dome. Enjoy the cool weather inside (especially good to escape the heat outside). The paths are systematic and very intuitive. Just follow the road and enjoy the beauty. Flowers just bloom on the walls and fences. It is a worthy visit especially if you are a nature lover.
,,worth the entrance fee,4.0,,Very nice tropical garden with modern and interesting design. A path from the top to the bottom makes it easy to see all the flowers and other exhibitions; worth the money!
,,Clou.d is within reach,4.0,,It's as close to the real ones as it get and located conveniently. Much easier access than in the nature.
,,cloud forrest spectacular,5.0,,"This truly a must to see if you are in Singapoor dont miss it .....it is the most amazing gardens ever , i was there for 5 hours just looking at these
magnificent gardens and waterfalls ...the gardens hold flowers , i had never before seen . the gardens are arranged in a unique way with walk ways and viewing towers ....all easy walking,....and absolute spectacular"
,,Even better than I had expected,5.0,,"Do to the great reviews I thought it was time to check out this attraction. One of the problems with high expectations is sometimes its just too high.

With the Cloud Forest though I was pretty surprised at how amazing this place is.

The technology and thought behind the concept are fantastic, a real eye opener and a clear statement to the world - I guess what else would you expect from Singapore?

We all over the place especially the apparent freshness of the air, one could stay in there for hours!

Of course the plants and trees were obviously great - an amazing feat of engineering and planning.

Wish I had bought a family annual ticket !"
,,One of a kind experience,5.0,,This man made falls is just one awesome attraction the tourists should never miss. 10 mins screening on how the world would be at the end of this century made us think a lot. Also a model depicts how these 2 conservatories are cooled down naturally by drawing solar energy from super tree structures. Overall we enjoyed the beauty and more educative for the kids.
,,Unbelievably amazing!,5.0,,"The moment you step inside the Cloud Forest, you not only appreciate the immediate escape from the heat outside, but your senses are overwhelmed by the massive indoor waterfall in front of you.
This is, to put it simply, the most amazing structure I've ever been in and words just don't do it justice.
Taking the lift to the top, you then wind your way down each floor, each one unique with plant life, mysterious carvings from around the world plus amazing glimpses of the Singapore skyline through the vegetation.
This attraction is a ''must see'' when in town, so no matter how limited your time is, be sure to visit the majestic Cloud Forest."
,,Best part of the Gardens!,5.0,,"Make sure you go here if you're at the Gardens by the bay. You may get wet if you get close to the huge waterfall they have. A nice walk, well planned. The elevators and escalators don't always reach the same level though."
,,Wondermazing!!,5.0,,"There is no other word to define it! Wonderful+Amazing!
It is beatiful diring the day but wow during the night! Do not miss it!! Try to reach there before the music ballet! 2 defined times after dawn.
This Avatar inspiring forest is breathtaking and really a exciting experience!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Beautifully constructed and maintained horticultural complex. A lift takes the visitor up to the top and then it is a casual walk down through the tropical forest
,,Incredible Visit!,5.0,,"With just a couple of hours left in Singapore, and having seen the Flower Dome the day before, we decided to see the Cloud Forest. It was closed the day before, and because it is quite different from the Flower Dome. It was worth the trip. It’s such a unique place, being under the huge glass dome, looking out over the Bay and seeing all the tropical highland plants and the world’s largest indoor waterfall."
,,fantastic!,5.0,,This was an amazing array of tropical flora. I loved the lily exhibit. GO!!! I think this was a must for a trip to Singapore
,,The biggest greenhouse I've ever seen!,5.0,,This enormous glass dome at Gardens in the Bay is a must see! It reproduces the conditions in which high altitude flora thrive and is stunningly verdant and lush. And an added benefit is that it is a cool haven from the humid Singaporean heat.
,,Really well laid out,5.0,,The canopy walks and waterfalls make it a nice place to walk around also it can get you away from the heat outside.
,,"Very beautiful, refreshing",5.0,,"A very beautiful place, suitable for elderly/wheelchairs. My mom sat on a wheelchair and she loved this place. The air inside is very refreshing. The main attraction is the giant waterfall at the entrance."
,,different experience,5.0,,the waterfall at the entrance was good and the view from the top was very good. the best part however was the documentary video shown at the end of the tour.
,,Don't be afraid of the height,4.0,,"Upon entering, you will be amazed by the high and cold waterfall that is right in your view. That alone, will just take up your time to appreciate that beauty. Do note that due to the mist, the floor may be wet and thus one should be careful while walking (esp if you have kids). There is also bridges hinged on around the Cloud Forest, where you can walk down from the top."
,,A Cool Mountain Forest Experience Even With A Wheelchair and without AMS!,5.0,,"I maybe guilty of being partial, being a proud Singaporean in rating this Cloud Forest, which is one of two air-conditioned domes displaying fauna from countries enjoying temperate weather. The other dome is known as the Flower Dome and this review will not be complete without reference to the Flower Dome as well.

Firstly, I think I qualify to describe what a mountain forest experience is, after having scaled the Goechala Pass in Sikkim, where I reached 5,000 m high. I also circumvented the Jade Dragon Mountain in Lijian on a mountain bike, climbing from 1,800 m to 3,100 m high on the Jade Dragon Mountain itself.

The Cloud Forest Dome is located in a fully airconditioned glass dome rising several hundred metres high next to the Marina Bay. It mimics the cool temperature that one experiences when located on a high mountain. For those on wheelchairs, no worries! There is a lift that will bring you all the way up to the Cloud where you will slowly descend on a wheelchair-friendly suspended bridge. You will enjoy the different fauna that are planted along the central spine of the Dome. The best part of it is that you don't have to suffer altitude sickness (>3,000 m high) visiting the Cloud Dome.

You will be greeted at the entrance to the Cloud Dome by a towering waterfall and the cool mist of mountain air, as if you were somewhere on top of a mountain. Great photo opportunities for the camera buffs. And selfie sticks are allowed! :)

The Flower Dome is right next to the Cloud Dome and it features fauna and flowers from all the temperate zones. There is an ongoing Lilies feature which is really beautiful. Every few months, the theme changes. The previous theme featured the Japanese Cherry Blossoms.

For anyone, Singaporean or tourist who need a respite from the humidity or rain, the Flower and Cloud Forest Domes will be a welcomed respite."
,,Another Singapore first,4.0,,"Singapore has many amazing man made structures and this does not disappoint. The worlds tallest man made waterfall and cloud forest, fantastic. The 'mountain' is covered with lovely rare greenery and fun to explore by foot or elevator."
,,I Love This Place,5.0,,"The cloud forest is lovely. The atmosphere inside is wonderful, and it provides a nice reprieve from the hot Singaporean air outside. It isn't expensive by Singapore standards and walking about is a somewhat surreal experience. If you are going to be in the Botanical Gardens I would suggest visiting here, and eating at Satay by the Bay."
,,"A remarkable, man made plant-museum and great place to get away from the heat.",4.0,,"Highly unique experience this is. Tickets are a tad pricey but that will depend on the currency conversion as well. Upon entering, the scent of greenery and moist air immediately freshens you up. The area is climate controlled so its always cool and wet. They have brought plants for many parts of the world so its an eye opener for sure. The entrance / exits are well planned such that you keep strolling from the start and the path will eventually lead you to the exit and you will have covered all parts of what needs to be seen. There are a cafe or two inside and a few restaurants out before the main entrance. But these are rather expensive. Well since these locations are near the Central Business District of Singapore (CBD), everything will be more costly than places out of CBD. I have been to Cloud Forest twice and I enjoyed both times there. Its refreshing and cool inside. And there is a waterfall just after the entrance which will of immense thrill for kids and adult kids alike!"
,,Average,2.0,,The best attraction of the cloud dome is the giant waterfall at the entrance. The crystal mountain is interesting. Rest of the dome is average.
,,Magical,5.0,,What a place. Each level was another mystery waiting to be discovered. As you wound your way up the different levels around the waterfall structure each one had its own character and held us fascinated for the whole time.
,,Lovely and cool,5.0,,Interesting! Lots of greenery and flowers and walking down from the top was amazing in the misty atmosphere.
,,Visiting Time is Important..,5.0,,"You should visit this place in the afternoon. There is a fantastic park outside and incredible light shows in the evening therefore if you go there around 4 oclock, it takes at least 3 hours walking around and see all flowers beauty, then you will not wait for night light shows.."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"An out of this world experience! A great way to see and understand how rainforests work, while having an absolutely amazing adventure on an incredible scale!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"I simply loved it. It's not only the dome futuristic design, but also the variety of species and the eco friendly design of both domes. The location is also fantastic. It's located at gardens at the bay, and you have there views to the most known skyscraper of Singapore and a big park to hang out. Must go."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,I loved the way this garden was set up. The running water made the area feel peaceful and refreshing. Beautiful specimens. Well worth the effort.
,,Very interesting concept,4.0,,This is a very interesting concept with the high bridges where you can see the forest tower from above and the surrounding garden.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Such an amazing structure, full of tropical plantings. The gentle incline takes you up several stories without even realizing it. Fabulous views of Singapore from the top and then a skywalk to the bottom. Everything about the place is spectacular"
,,COOOOOOOOLLLLLL,5.0,,ery educational; both the cloud forest and flower dome have a wide variety of plants and lovely flowers. Quite expensive though. We wanted to have toured the super trees as well but it requires paying entrance fees again. Even the tour around the gardens by shuttle bus with a recorded orientation/guide requires additional fees.
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,"I have been bring many guests to the Cloud Forest and it never fails to impress them.

It is certainly an experience not many will forget because of the whole ambience of the place with a little mystic to it especially in the late evenings around dusk. So visiting in the morning & evening will give one different experiences.

Schedule your timing to say like 5.30 pm to when the night falls. You will experience a little of what you see in the day and the night with all the lights inside the Dome and outside.... the night lights and the lights even of the ships anchored in the sea.

Definitely whoever visits will marvel at the engineering, the diversity of plants in the higher altitudes, etc. What surprised me was that even young children enjoyed it as much as the adults! We had a group of 16 both adults & children youngest 5."
,,Cloud Forrest Singapore,5.0,,A really amazing place and well worth a visit . Have never seen anything like it. Some fantastic photo shots.
,,Out of the world,5.0,,Words can't describe this place. One of the most amazing place for nature lovers. This place has variety of plant species that can't be find anywhere in the world.
,,Brillant cooling forest,4.0,,"The waterfall inside the cloud forest dome helps to cool down the entire exhibit. They have plants at various heights to portray which plants grow at which altitudes.

They also show alittle display of limestone structures in caves. Better to go during non peak hours to enjoy the tranquility and serenity."
,,Need a little cooling down?,4.0,,"When the heat of Singapore starts to get to you jump in a cab and head down to Gardens by the Bay. The cloud forest indoor attraction is deliciously cool with a huge waterfall that welcomes you as you enter. There are lots of plants and foliage to marvel at and even some made of Lego! As you walk up through the canopy you feel like you are in a rainforest.
Walk along the water and follow signs to the out door eating satay place, really good food at a reasonable price."
,,Nice cool place to visit in the heat,4.0,,"On a hot day is a great place to get some respite from the heat and is a great place to spend some time sitting, walking and looking at all the beautiful plants and flowers. One of my favourite place for a day out cause is nice and cool in there. Massive structure which will keep you in awe."
,,"Beautiful, cool gardens",5.0,,A misty rainforest contained in this hug hothouse while outside swelters in the Singapore heat and humidity.
,,A good place to visit,5.0,,"This is a unique experience - a cloud forest with a waterfall indoors! You can take a lift up to the top and walk down the ""mountain"" with the waterfall and take in some natural crystal sculptures as well. Make it part of your Gardens-by-the-Bay trip."
,,"Manufactured nature, cool environment",4.0,,The first thing that hits you when you enter is the cool temperature accentuated by the spray from the man-made waterfall. Plants grown in vertical arrangement is something new in Singapore. Different experience from botanical gardens & orchid gardens.
,,Nice place to cool off,4.0,,Been a few times as visitors are always interested to go. Great waterfall and some nice plants. Also the cool climate on a hot day at the gardens is much appreciated.
,,would definitely recommend to a first time visitor to Singapore,4.0,,"please add this to your itinerary. the whole gardens by the bay, cloud forest and flower dome is a must do (even though its a little out of the way for most tourist attractions other than the MBS casino). It is still worth a visit. especially so if they have some flower festival going on. go around late evenings so that the lights are on and the tree walk is even more spectacular."
,,Waterfalls and plants,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, went to both on same day, pay for each separately, walk the high platform if you are brave and go behind the amazing man made waterfall."
,,Quite imaginative,4.0,,We admired the very idea to have such beautiful flowers clinging to a five storey building. It is something which you will seldom see anywhere else. The waterfall inside adds to the beauty of the place.
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,"This is just an out of this world experience, pretty much like most things in Singapore. The climate under the dome imitates that of a cloud forest, humid and a little fresh compared with the outside. You can see a lot of plants growing at different altitudes as you go up, they also have elevators so walking is not your only option.
Nature intertwined with glass, stone and metal in a perfect manner.
They also show movies touching environment issues. When we visited it was global warming. Simple and educative.
The place is great for a refreshing walk. Too bad it doesn't have benches or other places to sit down except for the movies. But at the same time it provides for the traffic flow and the dome doesn't get overcrowded."
,,Great place to escape the heat and an engineering feat.,5.0,,The cloud forest is a wonderful example of engineering design to look and feel natural. Its a great place not escape the heat or the monsoonal rains. If you can go earlier in the day when there aren't too many tourists its a better experience.
,,Great Escape,5.0,,"So if you are finding the heat too much, be warned it feels very cool in here. Amazing plants displayed. a great way to see them to. Be warned if you don't like heights the walkways can be nerve wracking. But there is a solid section to walk on."
,,Out of this World,5.0,,"This must be on your list of things to do, and there is a reason why this is a world landmark. There is so much to do just in this dome, so leave about 2 hours to explore it well. I can not describe how amazing this experience was. Could do it over and over and over again. Well worth the high price-tag, you must do it."
,,A must see,5.0,,"An amazing creation with the great educational value, make sure you head there if you're in Singapore!"
,,WOW!,5.0,,"Defiantly worth a visit, rainy or hot day especially, it's $16 for entry, or $28 for this and the flower dome.
The work gone into creating the forest is spectacular, and if your in to plants it's breathtaking.
You can spend an hour and a half in here exploring, and for camera addicts you will be in heaven."
,,Must visit - Beautifully designed,4.0,,A must visit conservatory in case you visit gardens by the bay . There is another conservatory as well . You can buy a combo tickets for both of them
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"When going to Gardens by the Bay, there are 2 amazing buildings you can buy tickets into - this is one of them. 100% worthwhile going into"
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Thee are great views inside and out from the dome. The tower of flowers is gorgeous and the waterfall is lit up. Be aware it is a bit wet underfoot and can feel a bit chilly from the mist. Lovely!
,,Wow what an experience,5.0,,Gorgeous eyes escape from the tropical heat. Ample seating for us older folks. Plenty to see for those avid gardeners and just plain interesting.
,,Wow,5.0,,So beautiful .. could have stayed there all day. Really an engineering marvel and a little piece of paradise.
,,Lovely place !!,5.0,,"A place which we should never visit , this is one of the dome in Garden by the Bay, We were too tired walking , but getting in to the cloud forest with the view of waterfall and a rainy feel , the mind & soul became refreshed, worth going !!!"
,,A unique attraction,5.0,,"As you walk around you will realise it took some planning and imagination to get this unique attraction build.

We visited during the day and was a welcome respite from the outside humidity. There are plenty of plants and flowers to see as you make your way around the various levels of the forest.

It is a real education for adults and children alike.

We got off at the Marina Bay mtr train station."
,,Ecxellent,5.0,,The way this 'exhibition' has been designed was very interesting indeed and spectacular in places. It can be visited by all ages who I am sure will enjoy what it has to offer.
,,A must visit,5.0,,"This place has one of the highest man made indoor falls of the world. One can see and admire a wide variety of beautiful, colourful flowers, orchids, pitcher plants... The tree top walk is an experience in itself."
,,stopover singapore,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the cloud forest, the water fall amazing, combined the the flower dome, its very well done. The light show at night is cool also."
,,Beautiful place and worth the money,5.0,,"A very relaxing place to be at especially on a hot humid Singapore afternoon. Spent a whole afternoon there admiring the plants, flowers and architectures. Bring your cameras along, there are plenty of great spots for photos, selfie, and wefie. The misting happens every 2 hours and its kind of fun for the kids. Overall a good experience.

Staff members are mostly helpful and polite except for a cashier at the souvenir store who was looking moody and didn't even bother to say thank you after I have paid up for my purchase."
,,COOL INSIDE AND AMAZING PLANTS,5.0,,"I took about 1 hour to see this magnificent work of garden art and the S$28.00 for both domes was worth the money. Although there is much to see outside you could visit in here if it was raining, and when the rain stopped go out."
,,So Cool!,5.0,,Can't believe it took me so long to give this spot a try. Calming nature enclosed on a futuristic spaceship. Incredible!
,,Pleasant retreat,4.0,,"Great place to retreat from the heat outside! The cloud forest is nice to look at and you get good views from the elevated walkways. I wish there was better signposting to explain in more detail what you're looking at, though."
,,"Great place, should be on all Singapore tourists lists.",5.0,,"Such a wonderful layout, awesome plants and flowers. Perfect for a really hot day. Entrance into cloud forest is that you come face to face with a really great waterfall, so cooling.
downside to the display is that there is a large number of real stalagmites from caves around the world."
,,Not to be missed.,5.0,,"This is the most amazing collection of trees, plants and flowers that we ever seen under a dome. The range and colours were huge. Make sure that you allocate some time in Singapore to see"
,,Do Not Miss,5.0,,"We had no idea what to fully expect and this was a highlight of sights to see. Great for adults, groups and kids."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing to see a living rain forest ! 100's of rare plants are bred here! the structure itself is amazing with a water fall and 1000's of living plants and trees!
,,great experience,4.0,,"Great activity for the kids - space to run around, cool atmosphere and interesting flora and fauna to keep the kids interested. more interactive information about the flora and fauna would make it more interesting"
,,Stunning rainforest and wheelchair accessible,4.0,,"In my opinion, this is one of the best attractions in the city and it is totally wheelchair accessible. When you enter the Cloud Forest, it is like being in a mountain rain forest with waterfalls and spectacular plant life. But you don't just look at it, you experience it by going up in the lift and then coming back down through a pathway shrouded in mist and through waterfalls. It is a wonderful experience and all the better that wheelchairs can access all parts of it."
,,Worth a visit but if many maybe to expensive,4.0,,I've been to the gardens before and it's a nice place to walk around. This was my first visit to a dome and it was a good experience. I guess if your a big group it's a bit pricy.
,,Educational and intersting,4.0,,Very cool - both in temperature and the place itself. Really interesting and a great way to cool off after the heat of the day. Amazing plants that you just would never get to see unless you were trekking in rain-forests and mountains.
,,Incredibly stunning and impressive,5.0,,"This has to be one of the most beautiful,amazingly planned and orchestrated gardens that we have seen. It was breathtaking. When you walk on the metal walkway high above the ground it is even more impressive and the views of Singapore are incredible."
,,Unsure what to expect but excellent,5.0,,"Very well done and informative. Lots of incredible examples of rare high forest plants and flowers in a very pleasant setting.
Also a bonus is that it is definitely cooler inside than the heat outside.
Great display of carnivorous plants also.
About 1 to 1.5 hours."
,,Not for me,3.0,,Came to the Could Forest after visiting the Flower Dome. So the green here was a stark contrast with the colours in the Flower Dome. There is a man-made waterfall here which in my opinion was rather lame. I enjoyed walking around the elevated platforms but it is unlikely I will make a return visit; unless there is a new attraction here.
,,Worth it,5.0,,"We went twice - once early in the day (it was raining so even good to do on a rainy day) and another day early evening and it wasn't crowded. It's definitely better to see during the day. The clever way this has been designed is just amazing. It's a really beautiful place and worth the extra money to see. The walkways are easy to manage (even for older people/disabled). Our teenage boys even loved it. Even if you're not into gardening, you would still very much appreciate seeing this and if you are into plants, it will be a wonderland."
,,Mesmerizing and Soothing!,5.0,,"Coming from a country where we have abundance mountains, waterfalls and trees!... it sort of made me sad that how we take nature for granted...how much effort ppl are making to preserve it...and if we wont take care of the environment around us soon we will have to preserve it in dooms too....
Its an outstanding effort to make you realize how important the whole ecosystem is ...the moment you enter the doom you will feel refreshed...we spent whole afternoon in Gardens by The Bay...went to both the dooms..."
,,Interesting place!,4.0,,"I went at night so it was dark outside which made it less visually appealing inside the Cloud Forest. I imagine it is better during the day time but might be more busy. However was still a nice experience. I enjoyed the informative documentary they were playing at the end of the tour, gives you a lot of perspective."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The cloud forest is a climate controlled waterfall feature in a mountainous rain forest setting - inside a dome. Take the lift to the 6th floor and return via the ""cloud walk"""" - an aerial pathway winding down through the mist of the water fall. It is quite a spectacular. There is a myriad of plants and vegetation growing on the ""mountain"" We visited at night when the waterfall and dome was lit up. It is truly a unique and amazing ""must see"" when at Gardens by the Bay."
,,Very good,4.0,,Nice to see on our second visit to Singapore. Very crowded but if patient you can find your own space. Not as good though as expected.
,,Air conditioned garden paradise,5.0,,The cloud forest dome has a multitude of plant specimens on a mountain type structure including waterfalls and sculptures. The walkways are easy to manage and give you amazing views of the different plant microclimates. It is a wonderful way to gain inspiration for your own garden or just marvel at the astonishing variety of plants and flowers on display.
,,A Must Do!!,5.0,,"When at Gardens by the Bay, it is definitely worth the extra money to buy tickets for the Cloud Forest. It was absolutely fascinating and so cleverly designed. Don't forget your camera as there are so many things to photograph. Just beautiful."
,,Awesome View,5.0,,"Been here once and was amazed of the view. A good place for weddings, tour and family bonding! Though the place can be crowded over the weekend."
,,looks nice but nothing to do actually,3.0,,We were very excited to go there but there is actually nothing to do in the dome. You climb up and then go down that is all.
,,"Park by the bay, must see Singapore attraction.",4.0,,"Perfect walk for a hot day, convenient location next to major attractions. Recommended to families and couples."
,,Nice would go again.,5.0,,It was nice I would go again. Nice stroll off the metro waterfall was interesting wall was not too bad. Can do shuttle if desire.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Unique and utterly delightful - a not to be missed experience. Great in the evening before seeing the tree forest.
,,"Cloud Forest - Gardens by the Bay, Singapore",5.0,,Gardens by the Bay - including the Cloud Forest are absolutely wonderful. Can easily wander around the whole day so don't rush. Beautifully designed.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Wonderful experince to walk in this dome, ticket cost approx S$30 , but u can get discount with singapore airlines boarding pass. Buggy costing s$3 is available to commute till the dome."
,,Cloud Forest is amazing,5.0,,Have visited the Cloud Forest a few times now. It is ever changing and beautiful. Not as many orchids out in June as at other times. Still plenty to see. Loved it.
,,Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,Enjoyed both the Flower and the Cloud Dome as part of our day exploring the gardens. Make sure to also check out the supertrees and to leave enough time to do it at a leisurly pace.
,,Visualize a Cloud Forest...,5.0,,Feels like you were taken away from time and brought to a forest in the cloud...so poetic. Waterfalls spectacular and small entry fee but a great part of the garden by the bay. When we went it was not too crowded and easy access to all floors and views of the natural beauty and shots of city views. Beautiful blend of nature in Singapore.
,,It was a beautiful experience.,5.0,,"Being in the cloud forest & seeing the plants i would never normally see anywhere else was just fantastic! Its perfect for a hot day as its air conditioned and very cool in there. There were stunning flower colours, and beautiful leaf displays. With stalagmite & geodes as well!! i loved this place, it might have just been my favourite place to see in Singapore."
,,Nothing special ... but ...,3.0,,"Since flower dome and cloud forest are located very close to each other, the attraction will be combined with the flower dome. However, spend your time in the flower dome. The cloud forest is a nice to see, but nothing special ...

Few hints:
- in the domes (flower and rainforest) it is a bit fresh. Bring something with long sleeves. I found the flower dome much more interesting. Bring also a book. You have plenty of time.
- To rent a trolley for the kids you need an ID card (e.g. passport). The rent costs you 2 SGD.
- There is the Children Garden close by, which you can in any case enter for free. That is basically a big water play area. Bring a towel and some clothes for the kids AND for you. It's fun!
- Outside tour (to be paid extra) is not worth it. Better to stay longer in the flower dome and/or children garden."
,,We returned to this the next day after our arranged night tour,5.0,,"This in my opinion is also something not to be missed, I am not a Garden nut, but I totally enjoyed the experience this venue offered."
,,Just Indoor Waterfall,3.0,,"Nothing special but Indoor Waterfall and Skywalk Bridge which are get me interested.
There is a big screen showing documentary film about climate change. It's good to educate us to conserve the earth.
If you travel with your wife and have children under 10 yo, I think it's a good place to visit when you are in Singapore. But If you are Senior high school student or older and you travel with your friends on the same age, better save the money for USS. :D"
,,Worth a trip,5.0,,"We totally enjoyed this day trip. You are in a dome with beautiful flowers, waterfall is amazing. Take shelter from the heat."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Loved this including the lift to the top, then walk down, great views and photo opportunities. Separate tickets for each of the 2 massive glass pods."
,,Probably the coolest place I've ever been.,5.0,,"I can't believe humans made this. Seriously, this would never exist in the US. The shear size and beauty is literally breathtaking. In a city with a huge amount of attractions, this is a must see. I don't want to spoil the details, just go and be awed."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Well worth the visit it was stunning just loved the beauty. The walks and different levels was great. There is a lift up if you need extra help once inside
,,Great part of gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Impressive and relaxing. Enough to do and see, also for kids. The waterfall is pretty high! Take the elevator up to see it from the top."
,,Quite an experience,5.0,,"By far my favorite area of the Gardens by the Bay. There is an entry fee and for tourist (i.e. not locals) you need to buy the double pass to attend but certainly worth it. Especially on a hot and humid day, this place gives you refuge from the heat. There is quite a bit of walking (elevator for those less inclined) but it is worth the experience. The variety of plants held in this area is amazing and the waterfall takes your breath away."
,,Fabulous attraction,5.0,,"If you only have time to visit one attraction in Singapore, choose Cloud Forest. Within an enormous glass conservatory engineers and gardeners have re-created a cool wet tropical mountain forest environment that is endlessly fascinating. A lift takes you to the upper levels and you walk down enjoying the beautiful plant life: colourful flowers, a thousand shades of green, epiphytes and ferns. All around water falls as if in a mountain jungle. Just wonderful. At the bottom and inside “the mountain” a rather confusing educational display on the impact of global warming on the environment. Give it a miss – the information is overwhelming and chaotically presented. There is nowhere to sit, either. On the whole, though, a wonderful feat of engineering bringing an enchanting world of water and colour from cool tropical mountains to hot and humid Singapore."
,,Beauty,5.0,,Such a beautiful place to go. Although it's not for anyone who is afraid of heights (not that anywhere in Singapore is). You walk on a suspended bridge high above the ground at a beautiful vertical garden in a green house. So beautiful!!
,,Breeze,5.0,,One time experience Beautiful concept Only took 1 hour to see whole thing inside I think it will be great to took children or family group..
,,Family visit,5.0,,This place is awesome and everyone must visit when in Singapore . The waterfall at the entrance is worth seeing . Various forests depicted and the flora grown inside the dome is a creation of the genius . Wooden carved dragons are worth watching. This is an awesome place to visit
,,So Neat!,5.0,,"The cloud forest was so neat, it was so big and massive that it looks way better in person. There are a few different levels throughout to view different types of plants and it was so beautifully put together."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Cloud Forest. We purchased tickets through our hotel, which saved us a few dollars. The normal fee is S$28 per adult, which would give one access to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. You can access these two conservatories as many times as you like on the same day, as long as you get your hand stamped when you exit each area.

The Cloud Forest is a cooled conservatory and provided us with much-needed relief from the humidity of Singapore. The man-made waterfall is spectacular. We visited the Cloud Forest at about 4:00pm and then went to the nearby Flower Dome. It was dinner time when we finished, and we walked to Satay By The Bay (which took about 10-15 minutes) to have our meal. After sundown, we went back to the Cloud Forest to see it from a different perspective. We really liked the day and night views of the Cloud Forest, both of which are lovely."
,,Cloud Forest = Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"While planning for Singapore trip with family, I was told to visit Cloud Forest. I thought that 2/3 hours will be good enough. But once I entered the cloud forest, I was highly impressed.Falls at entrance was simply superb. I am really amazed to see how nicely the idea of cloud forest conceived, now it is maintained, whole dome is AC. How difficult it will be to maintain.Views from top is fantastic and photos there are extremely good.
We all forgot time there and I was not happy to leave that place. I left the place with oath that we will visit again and that to shortly, again and again"
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"We spend two days in Singapore and I cannot say how impressed we were with the whole city and this was one of the very best sites that we visited.
It's a must visit.
Note the exhibition on climate change and over population major eye opener."
,,Singapore Never fails to Amaze you,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a delight for the nature lover stuck in a modern world. The whole city of Singapore is blossoming into an amazing garden and cloud forest is one of the prettiest flowers in it.

A very modern take on the concept of nature trails, this is a place unlike seen anywhere else. One enters the dome and is greeted by a welcoming spray of cool mist. Post that we walk towards the multiple floors which await to be explored.

The beautiful gardens all across make it an unforgettable experience."
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,By far one of the highlights of Singapore. Take your time and don't rush and you will love the experience.
,,Amazing plant and waterfall display,5.0,,"Another amazing part of the Bay Gardens. $28 Singapore gives you entry into the Flower Garden and Cloud Forest. As you enter there is a beautiful high waterfall. This one is about 7 stories high and there are many plants and sculptures, as well as a stalagmite/staligtite display. A bit of humour with a Lego flower garden, spot the red back spider!!!"
,,Great experience,4.0,,Was great to visit inside this dome had a very beautiful waterfall...mists up at set times. Very busy with tourists. Just lovely inside. Recommend to anyone to go.
,,A cloud forest in a dome!,4.0,,"Really enjoyed the flora, waterfall and the enviromental message. How often do you get a chance to visit a Cloud Forest"
,,Cloud Forest - Spectacular!,5.0,,"This by far was the highlight of our weekend in Singapore - well worth a visit. They ""mist"" the forest regularly, and it is just beautiful to walk through."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The two domes at Gardens by the Bay are just sensational, as we say 'only in Singapore would you see this' Amazing displays, not too expensive and a must see"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Great architecture and beautiful botanic installation. Don't miss to see the flower dome as well. The enttance fee is absolutely worth it (don't bother taking the audio guide).
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"I have done a more in depth review under the ""gardens by the bay"" attraction. This will not disappoint. Just go, explore the whole dome entirely form top to bottom. Make sure to stay for the misting which is every 2 hours."
,,Loved it..,5.0,,"This place has taken my heart away.
The day when we planned for the Garden by the the bay was very boring since morning due to humid weather.

We were low and down till we entered the Cloud forest..

Eyes were widen and everything was mesmerising.
Worth, if we could go for the second time."
,,amazing,5.0,,"Magnificent you must see it when you are in Singapore, it is absolutely stunning. Allow at least two to three hours to see it all properly and fully appreciate it. I am not a garden person and yet would happily go back to cloud forest. Don't leave Singapore without visiting Gardens by the Bay and Cloud forest."
,,Unreal experience,5.0,,"People of all ages are amazed at the plant life that Cloud Forest showcases. From rare and beautiful orchids to predatory plants, this place is a unique and captivating experience, well worth the price of admission."
,,Cloud Forest - Amazing!,5.0,,"A quick trip for us, but lovely. Amazing display of plants, with information and education. The kid (husband) enjoyed this greatly."
,,A surperb Experience,4.0,,"One should not miss when visiting Singapore.Such an amazing place to visit.As soon as you enter,You find waterfall surrounded by lush green mountain and covered in mist. You can go up to seventh Level and later can walk down through a bridge. Beautiful view ,cool place."
,,Amazing & beautiful,5.0,,we were not prepared for how breath taking this place was - we loved it. definitely worth the entry price.
,,Unique set up and worth seeing,4.0,,Its another great attraction to visit in Singapore. Only negative point is it can be a bit too crowded. Try to go at an off time if you can.
,,"Stunning on the first visit, but worth visiting only once",4.0,,"Our first visit to the Cloud Forest, we were very impressed by the giant waterfall and had a great time walking downwards from the top. However, upon ending our visit, we felt that since the exhibit never changes, the novelty fades after the first visit."
,,Awesome forest!!!,5.0,,"If you wish to get into this dome, better go to the top floor first,feel the fun of walking on the narrow bridge where you can see the bottom floor from up 7th floor. Then walk slowly down. I love the water fall."
,,Natural & realistic forest in a dome,5.0,,"This is the best among the 2 domes. It's so unbelievable that how they managed to build everything indoors. The waterfall is beautiful. Some say, it shd be seen in day time but we saw it in the nite & found to be better with lightings etc. One can spend good 40-45 minutes here. Not to be missed at all."
,,Breathtaking in every way,5.0,,A surperb experience and one should not miss when visiting Singapore. This is the second time I have been and I enjoyed every bit a good as the first time.
,,Amazing...!!!,4.0,,Visited with family and enjoyed this amazing man made mountain and we'll managed will visit again in near future
,,Out of this world experience,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is the most amazing place in Singapore. It's the sheer aura of the place which gives you a feeling of being in an all together different world.
The moment you cross the doors, you find yourself standing in front of a fairy tale mountain with a beautiful waterfall.
The cloud walk on Level 6 takes you to in a fairy tale mountain surrounded by lush green mountain and covered in mist.
The hidden forest on the ground level is mysterious.
I must say , this place must be visited by anyone visiting Singapore.
You can buy a single ticket for both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
Only one suggestion "" visit Flower dome before visiting Cloud Forest """
,,Amazing! Totally happy I went,5.0,,"I have been meaning to get to Gardens by the Bay for some time and by chance was out walking around the marina and popped in. So happy I did. It cost SGD16 to get into the Cloud Forest but is so worth it. It's all air-conditioned and the plants/flowers on display are amazing. You walk in to the bottom of a waterfall and then catch a lift up to the top. Every 2 hours they produce mist which cover the mountain, it's a sight to behold. There is a walkway you can use to walk all around the mountain, I am not keen on heights but still pushed myself through it twice. Once when the mist was happening and once prior. I would definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Singapore."
,,A Very COOL Place,5.0,,"When you have been out in the heat, walking into the dome is very cool and Damp. The waterfalls, the vegetation, the water ways around the bottom are all lovely. Worth the money of the entry tickets."
,,Truely Amazing,5.0,,"This is one of the most astounding places you will ever visit , you don't need to be a plant enthusiast to appreciate the incredible engineering feat that this is . Entering the Cloud Forrest is simply breath taking"
,,A cool hideaway amidst beautiful flora !,5.0,,"When the heat got a little too much to bear and outdoor sightseeing of flowers etc seemed daunting, my friends and I dashed to Gardens by th eBay where the two air conditioned Domes provided all we wanted and more - in the most wonderful cool surroundings! The Cloud Forest offers beautiful permanent displays of flowering and foliage plants and an interesting display of stalagmites and stalactites as well. I would have liked more places to sit down to relax a little longer in the cool! But am grateful that such a beautiful indoor garden exists in this amazing city-state of Singapore!"
,,Excitement cloud forest experience,5.0,,"If u are nature lovers, u will enjoy visiting this place. It gives a full scenery of being at cloud forest. The waterfall and temperature also very enjoyable and gives an excitement"
,,Good for kids,5.0,,This place is good for kids to extend their knowledge about nature. It was fun and childrens definitely will be happy visiting this place
,,Wow!,5.0,,"o Absolutely stunning!!
o Cool, literally. ;)
o The moment when you walk into the cloud forest, you will be captivated by the man-made indoor waterfall. It was utterly electrifying!
- Many things to see, especially if you're a nature lover. Not only the flowers, but the whole architectural design. Make sure you have at least 90 minutes to spare.
- After taking pictures and being marveled by the beauty of this cooling waterfall, proceed to enjoy the views of City-Nature by taking the lift to the top. You will enjoy the attraction from top down.
o Perfection if you look from the top. I enjoyed looking at the bridges built for the flower-seeing experience. You just can't stop taking pictures!
o The little pond on the top level (level 6) was small but serene. This is where the water falls from!
o Hitman movie!! :)
- Foreigners have to pay S$28 to enjoy both of the domes (this being one of them) and it is a really good bargain. Do not miss this chance when you visit Singapore!
x Many people"
,,Dream,5.0,,It's something like in another planet.. it's so beautiful and amazing.. i take pictures every where because it's a place that you will not see like it again
,,Nice place to walk around,3.0,,"A refreshed glass house to grow mountain flowers and vegetals : not fascinating, but a nice place to walk around and admire the modern version of Singapore' s island of gardens."
,,The Name is True - It is a cloud forest,5.0,,"I have seen nothing like this earlier. This is worth a visit, I would say a must visit. Ultimate for kids to understand the magical beauty of earth.
If you read the information near each exhibit you will enjoy a lot.
You cannot even imagine that a great cloud forest would exist in a dome.
Will not spoil your adventure more. Just do not miss it."
,,Singapore trip 2016,5.0,,"You have to see this to believe it, I suggest you get there early, we got there around 10am and you will have the place to yourself. I can see it would get very crowded later in the day."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Really enjoyed being in here.. You get a little damp as you go in a the waterfall is right by the door. The high walkway is worth the effort although I was a little scared!
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Unexpected thought it was going to be just another hot house but so amazing. A 35 metres waterfall and walkways from top to bottom with spectacular plants and sculptures. So worth a Visit!
,,family visit,5.0,,"loved this part of the gardens, although it could get very busy it was still worth the visit. Waterfalls and some nice sculptures to explore as walk down each level."
,,"One of a kind, a must see in SIN",5.0,,"the waterfall, the sky walk inside the conservatory is beautiful. I liked this better than the flower conservatory. You have a choice of buying one conservatory ticket alone too. The audio guide is useless, too low on volume and not very clear accent. Was a total waste of 4 SGD."
,,Fascinating array of plants,5.0,,"Set on multiple levels go get up close to a huge number of tropical plant species. It is covered, so suitable for all weather. The metal walkways are see through, so if you are scared of heights it might not suit you.

The central part is 35m high and has a waterfall, which cools you down due to the mist.

A great place to photograph rare plants.

Kids have fun running around !!"
,,Cool Cloud Forest!,5.0,,"This is a unique dome within Gardens by the Bay. There is so much biodiversity in this dome and a lot of educational information. This place is good for families and kids and adults. There is a lot of interactive exhibits, beautiful nature and interesting facts. Definitely worth it!"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"The entrance waterfall, the walk way, the secret garden , the show , the well planned plants & flowers, all urge you to visit again"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,We decided only to pay for one of the attractions. It was beautiful and we enjoyed it. The surrounding park is worth a visit too.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Singapore continues to amaze and innovate. No hills = no problem - just build one! No waterfalls because no cliffs = just build one. Wont it be hot? No problem - let's encase it an air condition it. Wow. Go and sweat in air-conditioned comfort.
,,My Fave +5 Degree video,5.0,,"Educational conservation, we can feel the rainforest temperature. we can walk through the sky walk using lift.. But theres a great view if we use the sky walk... And make me realize to keep our world clean and nature, we can watch the +5 degree video, as i say at the title. this is my favorite video.. how can it be when earth temperature increase 5 degree.. there will be lack water, no animal can suffer... Go Green!!"
,,Just Spectacular,5.0,,"It is stunning, just go and see this attraction which is very accessible no matter your mobility and its so cool in there after the Singapore heat"
,,I expected more,2.0,,"Nicely designed and built, but a little bit too much amusement park/tourist trap. Nice on a rainy day with the kids, but don't expect too much."
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,Totally unique - brilliant for all ages - though quite a lot of walking on slopes for the elderly or infirm. Though there are lifts.
,,There is nothing like this anywhere else in the world,5.0,,It make a powerful statement with a very relevant message on global warming and environmental protection. A mini forest inside a dome . Very well laid out plants and very nicely presented . The sky walk inside the building is an experience in itself
,,Was worth our time!,5.0,,"My friends and I had a leisurely and well-spent afternoon here. Pretty educational, too, for kids. I'd go back again!"
,,Good place if youh have time,4.0,,Good place to enjoy clouds if you have time. One can enjoy the tropical environment with lot of clouds and greenery.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Great tourist attraction. A truly incredible place to see. We spent the whole day here and could have easily visited a second time. Very spread out it did not feel busy. Lots of look at and a variety of different exhibits and things to see. Great with a family. We will definitely return.
,,Great,5.0,,"Great way to escape the Singapore humid weather as the dome is climate controlled (air conditioned). Beautiful scenery, plants and flora from many parts of the world."
,,Tropical Oasis,5.0,,"With a storm outside this was a fantastic venue to shelter. Cooled and moist to allow the plants to thrive, you could gain a close up view of all the vegetation, waterfalls etc by taking the skywalk which wound around the mountain. Fantastic!"
,,Magical amazing garden,5.0,,The Cloud Forrest and the Flower Dome are must see's. We had been to Singapore before but not gone into these two conservatories. Seriously so glad we did this visit. They are an amazing tropical escape. The Cloud Forrest with its most amazing inside waterfall and lush gardens is just magical. MUST SEE.
,,Had to go as wife wanted to.,4.0,,I am not a gardener or a person who appreciates landscaping but the cloud forest was fabulous. Firstly it was air condition. It was quite impressive. Would i go again - no. Its not for me personally but if you like plants yes.
,,Something a little different,5.0,,This was a total difference to the Flower Dome that we visited prior but just as impressive and different to anything else I have visited previously. You need a head for heights if you are to go to the top and use the walkways back down that weave in and out of the centre of the dome but the overall effect is worth the effort.
,,"Amazing, Forest Dome!",5.0,,"The Waterfall at its entrance just mesmerises you with cool air giving you the feel of rains. The entire forest creation is well done and maintained. Should not be missed, so check out dates when Cloud Forest is closed for maintenance (it is published in advance) to avoid disappointment."
,,Interesting engineering,4.0,,"The whole area at Gardens by the Bay include this attraction ,Flower Dome ,super tree grove. This at least a 2/3 hour tour, lots of displays of flowers. You can reach it by public transport , then a walk or walk across the Helix Bridge from the other side of the Bay. Definitely worth the visit."
,,Very Good,4.0,,One of the best thing about Cloud forest is that it is centrally a/c so you dont need to worry about then weather...it was truly amazing
,,extremely stunning place,5.0,,"For this dome,I totally recommend every tourist to visit here.I work as landscape architect and I found this place quite stunning.I feel impressive every time I've been here.You won't regret if you visit Cloud Forest Dome I 100% guaranteed!!"
,,Must see!,5.0,,This was one of my favorite places to visit in Singapore! Worth every dollar!! Great place to enjoy and take pictures!
,,Misty Mountain,5.0,,"This attraction is a must see in Singapore. The waterfall is huge -storeys high- so spectacular. At every turn there is something delightful to see, even stalagmites. I was not expecting such a treat. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to savour each new experience."
,,Great visit!,5.0,,Great experience we had. I loved the forest cloud... Very nice for those hot days when you like to just go out and chill.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Even for those with a phobia about heights(like my father), this is a must do. He thoroughly enjoyed this experience"
,,Unique!,5.0,,"Really unique and of course like everything else in Singapore pretty amazing.

It is a totally man made botanical environment and really nice if you wanted to get away from the heat.

Really well designed and not overly busy with tourists which is always a nice bonus."
,,So Beautiful,5.0,,The scenery is great if you take elevetor to the lost world you can see marina bay from there and not only lost world you can watch a movie and learning about earth. Great education if you bring your kids here. In some time the dome spray water from the falls so it looks like a cloud
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,"The thoughtful layout of this spectacular attraction leaves you spell bound. The plants are colourful and aromatic, with varieties that I haven't encountered before. Each has something new to see and admire. The views looking out over Singapore harbour and river are spectacular from this vantage point"
,,A rainforest inside of a dome,4.0,,"If you enjoy nature, then you'll enjoy Cloud Forest. There is a waterfall inside which provides moisture to the ""cloud forest"". A temperature-controlled environment with various plants, orchids, etc. are arranged among the slope of the ""mountain"".

I enjoyed seeing both the Cloud Forest and the adjacent dome which simulates other environments. Many different orchids were on display in the adjacent dome but I think this was only on temporary display. Children would love Cloud Forest."
,,Most beautiful and Never to miss attraction,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay is among the most unbelievable places in Singapore, one can visit. I can simply say, heaven on earth has been recreated and there cannot be words to describe the beauty of the manmade waterfall, the viewing gallery, the tulip gallery and every other thing which words cannot sufficiently describe. If you ave not seen this, you have not seen Singapore at all."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Like everything they do in Singapore this is amazing. AND it's air conditioned inside which is such a relief from the humidity and heat. There is a charge to go in but it's free if you are there with a Singapore stopover card.
,,wonderful experience,5.0,,You can easily spend 2 hrs here. The exhibit is well organized and very informative. Lots of fun. The exhibit is lovely and reminded me of a trip to Costa Rica
,,Great for a cool change,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is in Garden By the Bay, you can walk over the bridge and from the top you can see the falls which are spectacular. An enormous man made air conditioned green house with a great variety of tropical plants and other species."
,,Wornderful experience,5.0,,"Best part of Gardens By The bay. A mixture of fun, education and wonder. Reasonable prices given the surroundings and upkeep."
,,What a wonderful respite,5.0,,Inside the Cloud Forest is about 15 degrees cooler than outside. The orchids are breath-taking. They even have Lego flesh-eating plants!
,,A cooling experience and an escape from tropical heat,5.0,,A visit in the architecturally very interesting and beautiful element of the Gardens by the bay is both exciting regarding the beauty of the nature and the art on display and regarding its cool climate. On entering the Cloud forest I immediately felt energized and this feeling lasted until we ventured to other attractions of the Gardens by the bay.
,,A cool place to visit,5.0,,"I've visited cloud forest twice, once with my husband and once with a visiting friend and as the plants evolve it was different each time. Love the building too and it's a great escape from the heat. Not what I expected as its a giant greenhouse. Worth the entrance fee."
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is part of Gardens by the Bay. Just gorgeous with copious tropical plants and other specimens in a controlled environment.
,,A Great Marvel,4.0,,"Even though its man-made, its a great sight indeed. Worth coming back again and again. Air-conditioned and easy to navigate around the area."
,,Great way to spend an hour out of the heat,4.0,,Fantastic tropical flowers in a unique setting. It's got good wow factor in certain places and is very well laid out inside. Can probably get a little busy though and there are lots of good natural and free alternative attractions in Singapore. That said it's still worth a visit while in the gardens by the bay.
,,Fun and Relaxing,4.0,,"The cloud forest and flower garden are in very modern, cool buildings, and are surrounded by equally cool flower pod structures. You can explore at your own pace. I think this would be interesting for older kids. I do wish the flower garden had a larger variety of flowers (it was mostly tulips when we visited)."
,,Must See Place in Singapore,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is in Garden By the Bay, you can walk over the bridge and from top also you can see the falls. it is completely artificial one."
,,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL....,5.0,,Absolutely must visit with all.... It's wow..... Great for all age groups... Foliage is wow and the waterfall is truly magistrate n magical
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Really enjoyed the cloud forest - beautifully planted,and very well thought out - if you enjoy plants and tropical gardens, you'll love this. At the end is a short video presentation which is amazingly well done, and certainly worth watching."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Truly amazing. This green house is beautiful, cool, interesting and an absolutely great way to spend an hour. The walkways could be intimidating for people who are afraid of heights so you should be aware of that before you buy tickets to this attraction"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,An Amazing jungle in the middle of the city. The tropical rainforest is spectacular! It is a wonderful break for the senses. It is like being transported to the Amazon!
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,A wonderful tropcial waterfall oasis. So many plants and a river and a sky walk.At one stage there was a steam or mist that filled the whole complex.It was just so beautiful.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Just wht to say its amazing.. Wht a artifical climate created inside..just like hill station..clouds water falls..hills.. just amazing..
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay. There is a small fee for entrance, however it's well worth the cost!"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,This was a very fascinating exhibit. It was a good value for the entrance price and was a welcome relief from the heat.
,,Simply Amazing !!,5.0,,A one of a kind experience that every visitor to the Gardens by the bay should experience. We made it twice to the top just to experience the Cloud Forest amidst due drops and mist. The fresh aroma of a natural sanctuary engulfs the whole dome which is simply massive. The air conditioning inside was something special.
,,Mesmerising views,5.0,,"No one could have thought that the domes overlooking the Singapore river visible from the Singapore flyer (also a worthwhile visit) would be entrapping a whole forest inside it. It is beautifully maintained and every level of the forest - yes, it has levels :) - unravels something unique. Please do visit the cloud forest and have great time!"
,,Impressive indoor waterfall,5.0,,By entering the hall you will be impressed by the huge waterfall which is coming down from the top. Be aware that it is very crowdy in the afternoon when its very hot outside.
,,A Must See!,5.0,,Absolutely loved the Cloud Forest! It was beautiful and very well looked after. The waterfall is huge and has amazing plants and flowers along the waterfall wall. The forest is self sustaining which is great to see. There is also a video at the end explaining this process which is fascinating. There is a slight mist in the air from the waterfall. The dome is also air-conditioned which was great on a humid Singapore day.
,,Wow... just wow!,5.0,,Went here as part of the Marina Bay Gardens and it was amazing. It was truly a beautiful place to visit. A must see for every local and tourist.
,,Surreal and well worth it,5.0,,Certainly the best indoor mountain I've ever seen! I'm not too into plants and so on but I'm really glad I went here. So bizarre it seems out of science fiction
,,Awesome display of greenery.,3.0,,Beautiful waterfall. Lots of information displayed as you walk around the dome. Flowers and greenery everywhere. The global warming section is a huge eye opener. Very good air conditioning on a hot day.
,,Beautiful and a new experience,5.0,,We went to the Cloud forest in late evening. It seems a good time to visit then. The cloud mist is released at 8pm so you should try to be at the top during that time. There is a combined ticket also for Flower dome and Cloud forest
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,"Really well worth the time to see the cloud Forrest The water fall is very well done, so many great picture opportunities here. The spray from the water fall is also cooling."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Beautiful man made waterfall, with walkway built around it filled with tropical plants. This would be a good activity on a rainy day as the whole thing is covered by a glass dome. Dont miss the light show in the evening just outside."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This indoor mountain was really clever how it was built and well worth the admission fee to see something so unique.
,,Great experience,5.0,,This conservatory is also great to see at sunset because colors change and the amazing waterfall is lit up.
,,Lovely,4.0,,I will say it is a must visit in Singapore. The indoor waterfall is really great. Great piece of engineering. Even the atmosphere feels like it is raining.
,,Lovely Day,3.0,,Lovely view of nature indoors. It's pretty cold inside the dome. Choose a date where there's not many people. Take beautiful pictures n breathe in the fresh fragrance from the plants !
,,Part of the whole Gardens by the Bay experience - not to be missed!,5.0,,"Although this might not be too authentic, it's got a great waterfall, and is a fun thing to do. The 'misting' happens about once an hour and creates a great atmosphere. It's unusual, it's different and definitely part of the whole experience."
,,Very worthwhile visit,5.0,,"Wonderful place cooling with the beautiful waterfalls numerous variety of plant , very comfortable walk . Visited many time and each is a great experience."
,,Fascinating experience,5.0,,"The cloud forest was a fascinating place. There is a waterfall as you enter, then you can walk or catch a lift upwards through a tremendous variety of gorgeous plants and flowers. There are automatic misting sprinklers which keep the atmosphere cool and moist, which is great after the heat outside. This was my favourite experience in Singapore."
,,Artificial but still overwhelming,4.0,,"Although totally artificial, this tropical mountain is quite charming and overwhelming. Waterfall is pretty amazing, and then there all these cute corners with different flower species and lots of ethnic wooden statues that keeps a balance between the steel and glass and actually mother nature. Worth visiting."
,,beautifully maintained garden,4.0,,"Beautiful maintained garden with many hybrid coloured frangipanis, hibiscus and bougainvilleas . Lift $S8 pp to go up to next level for wheel chair access. MRT just within reach and next door to Marinabay sands hotel. Views over the harbour and city and famous iconic lion head statue."
,,Spectacular Forest,5.0,,Such a great indoor attraction. A real tropical forest in a city. A great way to spend a relaxing couple of hours.
,,Fun place to visit,4.0,,We have been here several times and the kid still loves it. The waterfall is the favourite. There is a walkway up high too have another view from top. Lots of flower n plants and interesting statues.
,,Cloud 9,4.0,,Great views here!.cool ..Ive been to many places but this is the first time I saw something like this superb architecture.
,,Amazing Garden,5.0,,"This is an amazing garden set over 7 levels complete with a waterfall, interesting sculptures, and of course, a great display of plants.
The lift provides easy access to the upper levels and you can enjoy a leisurely walk back down through some of the most delightful gardens.
Easy access for fitness levels and ages.
In combination with the Flower Dome and the ""Trees"" night show, this is a great activity late in the afternoon. Allow 3+ hours to do all 3 locations."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,An amazing place! I found the whole structure a fantastic experience. The planting was beautiful- flowers and vegetation looked fresh and thriving. Take cameras for some exquisite memories. The only irritation is the selfie takers who seem to incapable of taking a photo without their face in the foreground. Allow at least a couple of hours to enjoy the surroundings. Probably not something that small children would appreciate.
,,Magic,5.0,,"This was my favorite attraction in Singapore. I wrote about it already under Gardens by the Bay, which it is part of. The indoor waterfall is very cool; spectacular views of the bay, the sands hotel, the grounds, etc. Plan to spend 90 minutes just inside the cloud forest dome - you won't be disappointed."
,,Cloud forest dome,3.0,,Man made mount trickling waterfall surrounded by plants and ferns. It has some large natural crystals displayed as well. It's just a roundabout walk over the mount. It's air coned and pretty cool. The Flower dome is more interesting and there is charges for the entrance fee for the domes. One fee lets you in both domes. If you do not wish to pay entrance fee then you can enjoy the out door garden which is free. They have a few restaurants there you can dine.
,,Visiting family,5.0,,"We were recommended to visit the cloud forest and we weren't disappointed. The plants are amazing and we even saw where Lego is grown!! The building has so many levels with elevated walkways that allow you to view the vegetation from all angles.

As you leave, you are offered a hand stamp that allows you to return later if you want, which is great if you miss the misting first time round. The whole building is equipped with mist jets everywhere which keeps the humidity levels up for the plants.

This is a great way to pass a few hours away, from the uncontrollable heat and humidity outside."
,,Best of the gardens by the bay,4.0,,Best of the domes- although cold and wet at times the sights were amazing and the construction excellent. Worth a visit on the rainy day.
,,Take a step into a mystic world.,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a must see thing to do in Singapore. If you have the time visit both Domes, the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome as each is totally different. This Dome has a spiraling walkway which gives you a beautiful view over the entire forest. It is lovely and cool inside, a nice way to escape the Singapore heat. Worthwhile buying tickets before hand online as the queue for tickets at the gardens is very long."
,,great indoor forest,4.0,,"a very hot and humid place, giving you the sense of a tropical forest, with the biggest indoor waterfall"
,,Nothing much to see really,2.0,,just and indoor water fall and the view outside. not much really to see. just do the flower one and use the time to go around outside this dome.
,,A bit artificial but educational for kids,3.0,,Been there a couple of times but no much has been changes so I guess once is enough. The rainforest looks artificial but I guess there is the limitations for a small area. The concept is interesting as you can walk down from the 7th floor down nd you get to see different plants along the way.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Nice feel of nature, once of a kind experience. though it involves a bit of walking, Overall worth the visit"
,,Our favourite attraction at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,This was hands down our favourite attraction at Gardens by the Bay. The walkway and the plants and all the carvings - oh my! Such a feast for the eyes. My husband enjoyed the cooler air! I had never experienced a cloud forest before and highly recommend it.
,,amazing and must see attraction place,5.0,,this place has everything you want to beat the heat of Singapore cold climate and various plants from sea level to 4500 m above sea level.the waterfall is rejuvenating and also plants which we don't see can be seen due to this place
,,Up above so high!,5.0,,"This place showcase a beautiful experience of a conservatory up above so high.
The plants here are mostly those that tropical highlands. With an indoor waterfalls, it is truly a cool moist conservatory.

It is easy to access the top portion of the cloud forest. You take the lift to the top of the mountaintop to discover the unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests.

Then you take a stroll along a walkway, challenging for those who have fear of heights, in the clouds for an aerial view of the canopy and mountainside below.

Truly, a wonderful experience at the cloud forest."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,"Well worth visiting, well organised venue to help tourist traffic flow well. Probably preferred this out of the two domes as this has a large waterfall as its main feature"
,,Amazing Cloud Dome,5.0,,"Felt just like i was in a tropical jungle & came across a waterfall. What an amazing attraction, inside Gardens By The Bay. Well worth the money to get in & its not that expensive anyway. Full of information about our planet in the secret garden. Absolutely beautiful, a must see. Nothing like it anywhere else in the world."
,,Flowers and Waterfalls Galore,5.0,,"Being a lush forest with plenty of plants and the tallest waterfall, it was a nice place to meander along the plant/flower-lined pathways to the walkway above to look at the 360 degree view of Singapore as well as cool off while enjoying the colors provided by a variety of flowers/plants along the way."
,,Nice afternoon with family,3.0,,"We've planned to visit Cloud Forest on Sunday but queue was too long and we tried once more on Monday (even though it was holiday we did it earlier and queue was definitely smaller). Great thing with this place is that inside temperature and climate provides a relief from the one outside. Don't get me wrong, the whole building, construction and plants inside are great but from the horticultural perspective it takes some time to see true rain forest. All in all I recommend this place as it is family friendly."
,,A wonderful place to chill off,5.0,,In most of the year hot singapore a really nice place to walk around and cool off. The greenery and waterfalls are breathtaking and relaxing at the same time.Come in the morning as it gets crowdy later on in the day.
,,out of the world,5.0,,A must visit during singapore visit.check closure dates & timings before panning your visit.Also check the misting timings to getbthe special experience
,,Cool Ambience,4.0,,"Atmosphere is very cool as it is fully airconditioned. Aritificial waterfall is quite cool and view from the top floors is nice. It would be good to bring children and go through some interesting media and take photos in the photo zone. If you are type of a person who doesn't like the humid/hot climate of Singapore, I'd totally suggest this place, just to chill and roam around without getting annoyed.
It's somewhere between ""average"" and ""very good"". Compare to the things you get to enjoy and see, ticket is quite expensive if you don't go thru any discounts or package system. I'd suggest you to look for ticket at Carousel (Singapore Second hand stuff application) or Qoo10 (Online Shopping mall) to enjoy a lot cheaper price. If you are short on budget, but still wanna go thru Singapore tourism spot, I think it's no harm for you to skip, unless you love exotic plants and flowers."
,,Worth Seeing,4.0,,Cloud Forest is part of Gardens by the Bay. I would recommend seeing this and the Flower Dome as it is a good experince while visiting Singapore.
,,Excellent place to cool down in a humid weather!,5.0,,The moment we stepped in the cool air flowing into the entire cloud forest's area was an welcoming relief from the outside heat. Thoroughly enjoyed the waterfall and the surroundings. To enjoy more avoid on weekends and on public holidays.
,,Love the waterfall,3.0,,"The Cloud Forest is in an area with airconditioner, thus is suitable for toddlers or babies. Our babies enjoy the visit especially the waterfall. Personally, worth it for first timer but dont think I will repeat anytime soon with the price tag."
,,Very Beautiful!!,5.0,,The ability to place this garden in some architecturally attractive buildings was amazing. Very creative.
,,We love it for sure you will too...,5.0,,"We're lucky to visit the cloud forest on the last day of our 6 days holiday in Singapore. As soon as we enter the garden dome , we fall in love with it. Phobia with heights, don t you worry because the place is so awesome, you'll forget about it.
Highly recommended."
,,Brilliant.,5.0,,"I was a bit dubious about this attraction initially, but as soon as we entered, I could see it was unfounded. The concept is fantastic and its executed with style. Lots of ""hidden"" artworks throughout the place and the gardens are amazing - as a plus, the whole place is kept at 23 degrees C and as such it's a welcome relief from the outside heat.

Only drawback was the hordes of weekend visitors - but it didn't make the experience too terrible in the end.

Tip : combine your entry ticket with the flower garden and eat at 'Satay by the Bay' just around the corner.

Allow a half a day to complete both terrariums, lunch/dinner and to see/climb the super trees in the garden."
,,Horticulturist's Dream,3.0,,If your into your plants and gardening --gorgeous wandering amongst the plants and amazing old trees narled and knotted. Huge indoor waterfall - I saw this as part of night tour and was a bit quick - waterfall at night is lit up.Can see on a rainy day as cloud forest indoors.
,,Amazing structure,4.0,,"This futuristic tower is full of plants and waterfalls. You walk round the bottom and then go inside the tower, up to the top and out onto a skywalk.Fun for all the family. Did this with Gardens by the bay, on one ticket price."
,,A nice cool place,5.0,,Cloud forest is one of the best attraction in Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyed the flora and the waterfall. Its a wonderful experience.
,,Unique building and great fun with kids,5.0,,"This definitely has the wow factor as you walk in and see the tall ""mountain"" of trees with the waterfall in front, framed by the glass and steel exterior. It's a lot of fun to walk up and around, especially the long hanging walkways. Don't get too close to the waterfall unless you don't mind getting a bit of spray."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,There must have been an incredible amount of money and time spent making and designing this attraction it's amazing. It's a huge area with millions of plants. We rushed our visit because we wanted to watch the light show in the gardens. It is so refreshing on a hot day and you could spend hours observing everything. Price was a bit high but thought it was a must see! Even if you are time poor add it to your must sees!
,,Cooling sanctuary amidst the sweltering heat of day,5.0,,"The 7 storey water fall creates a majestic entrance the moment you enter the building. You cannot help but pause to look up in awe... Camera shutters will go off in rapid succession. This eden of mystical ambience will thrill and delight most people, even if you're not a nature lover."
,,Must do,5.0,,These domes in the Marina Bay gardens are amazing. You couldn't go there and not see them. There's an educational section at the bottom with a movie on loop that is quite shocking.
,,a must visitin singapore,5.0,,take the your first then the walk the view from the walkway is great plenty of places to eat so take your time some surfaces are wet so wear good footware
,,Excellent,5.0,,"I found this to be an excellent display. I am not into plants at all but I was very impressed by the range of plants and all the information supplied about them. There is a large artificial waterfall which is really good as well.

Obviously it is not the same as visiting a real rain forest but it is a marvellous place to learn about them and to visit something akin to one without all the accompanying discomfort experienced in visiting a real one.

All in all I would recommend this as a place to visit"
,,Spend hours in the cool,5.0,,Great place with 1000s of plants from around the world growing in an air conditioned world where you can spend hours escaping from the heat.
,,Spectacular!,4.0,,"It looks great and makes for good photos. But I fail to see the value of something like this. Its a must do if you're in Singapore. Make sure to take warm clothes for this and there is a lot of walking, so plan accordingly."
,,Impressive but not amazing,4.0,,"Whilst these indoor Gardens are well constructed and carefully thought out and planned , their artificial nature is very apparent and they cannot compare with the beauty of anything natural . My companion commented that someone had built a concrete pile and stuffed plants in it. Whilst I disagree with this exaggerated representation I can understand what made him say it. I don't necessarily think that this attraction has anything to recommend it over and above many other tropical gardens I have seen in zoos apart froma larger than average waterfall ."
,,an amazing display,5.0,,"I never expected there to be so much variety on display in such a relatively small area but by using the height, the waterfall is 35m high, they have created something quite amazing."
,,Must Go !! this is different,5.0,,what a beautiful place. Felt like i was walking in amazon forest . I went with my family and my daughter who was 2 loved the place. beautiful flowers and the waterfall set your mood right. I had night flight and my 5th day in Singapore was very pleasant and nice.
,,An amazing assortment of plants and trees,5.0,,"I loved this place, they had an amazing assortment of plants and trees from all over the world. I walked around for hours just looking at all the different plants and reading about them. A great place for kids and adults."
,,One of the best indoor gardens I have seen,5.0,,"I cannot begin to describe my face as I entered this dome. The variety of plants available, the mist, temperature can only be described as a work of perfection."
,,Incredible engineering workpiece,5.0,,"This is a great idea to improve any city waterfront. As an engineer I kept looking at the design and execution. Architects were allowed to do their best, no cost cutting visible. As an amateur gardener, the vertical walls of flowers must be quite difficult to maintain. I could see the folded crane but cannot imagine how can that be handled. The crowds seemed ready to pay for this view. I was most impressed by some very unique violet plants with blue flowers and the carnivores."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Very innovative inside garden. Great for families or couples or individuals alike. Fun to explore. Cool and soothing as well.
,,Imagine you are in a rainforest!,5.0,,So lovely. Well designed example of a tropical rainforest habitat. If you love nature and want to experience the look and feel of being in the canopy of a tropical habitat ...don't miss this walkway. Misty and lush.
,,nice place,5.0,,"a very scientific way to teach new generation about our flora and steps to preserve it, very informative information dispelled by both audio and visual aids"
,,"GREAT, You can visit multiple times. Just get your hand stamped!",5.0,,"We visiting both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Garden. While we enjoyed both, we thought the clouds forest was AMAZING! If you really like it, do not worry you can go back though. Just get your hand stamped. The views are AMAZING! You can get discount tickets through a Handy phone provided by your hotel SGD$20 for both the Flower Garden and Cloud Forest. Best of all it is air conditioned. A GREAT break from the heat!"
,,A must place to see !!,4.0,,"It was amazing how they put all the trees and flowers in this dome. They have a very good how to tell story & educate people about cloud forest by dividing into diffrent section such as bird eye view, water fall view and cloud view, etc."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"I've had holiday with my friends there. It was so excited. Cold and cozy, we could took many photos there. The only cloud forest in the Southeast Asia, you must go there if you're in Singapore. I love their monoblocks which built as flowers and its garden, they looked so real. It was amazing!!"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Such an amazing space. So well thought out and beautifully presented. How someone had the vision to create this leaves me in awe.
,,The best within Gardens by the bay!,5.0,,"This Cloud forest dome is the highlight of Gardens by the bay. The waterfall, the greenery, the overall natural setup makes it a surreal experience!"
,,Beautiful and mesmerising,5.0,,Lots of beautiful photo opportunities. The highest man made waterfall in the world is awesome. My feet were rooted and I just didn't have enough
,,"It cost you money, but worth spending it",5.0,,One of the best thing we did in Singapore. It's really amazing the way it's made and worth going in. Take time and enjoy the mist and fog they create along with all kinds of plants.
,,its really a forest,4.0,,"just when entered the forest, there is waterfall welcoming us. First I bit feel , oh we will get wet, but no.. its not. Its inside the house, and all we can see is waterfall and some tree"
,,Walk through the Clouds,5.0,,"This is just a magical experience, from the huge fountain on arrival till you climb up and into the Clouds. We were lucky to arrive at midday when they have the mist spraying out and it certainly gives you the impression of walking through the Clouds.
This is not to be missed when visiting Singapore"
,,Spectacular; nothing like it anywhere.,5.0,,"This is an amazing experience. Allow plenty of time to wander slowly upwards, looking carefully, taking photos enjoying the beauty and being in awe of its design and the quality and variety of the plants. Its absolutely spectacular."
,,Great ambience,5.0,,It was a wonderful experience being at this place. One should never miss being at this place when one visits Singapore
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,This was so magical. A walk through the clouds. A futuristic place. A huge fountain greets you and then your walk begins. A must visit for all tourists
,,Beautiful Flora,4.0,,"The domes(Flower dome & Cloud forrest) were quite a pleasant & cool experience. The indoor waterfalls, flora, & videos were quite educational and enjoyable. Amazing all the work and thought that must have been put into this to house so many plants from so many different parts of the world. Visited during the lovely tulip display which was a bonus. I think some of the signs could be a bit bigger so it would be easier to read whats what.
Outside-The walk on the skyway from one Supertree to another is not really for anyone afraid of heights but a nice walk for this who have no fear!"
,,Oustanding,5.0,,Could have spent the entire day inside here. Simply amazing creation. Like the name 'Cloud Forest' is completely fitting & no better description could possibly be found.
,,Mist in The Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Just part of The Gardens By The Bay experience was my visit to to Cloud Forest. Mere words cannot describe this visual and sensory experience. It's serene, the plants and flora and carvings wonderful the sound of the waterfall and the mist as you walk high above the forest left me spellbound. Please put this wonderful place on your list of places to experience. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,I never seen such kind of modern engineering to create a beautiful place. This place is relatively cold so better to take warm cloth. This place is also informative for those people who are not well aware about the climate change.
,,Love it... amazing indoor landscaping,5.0,,Sensational waterfalls inside and big walkway. Remarkable experience. I love the lego sculpture that was placed with natural landscape. Then the myriad of flowers creeping through the walls are very impressive.
,,"Beautiful waterfall, amazing flowers and nice and cool!",5.0,,"Well worth the trip, the waterfall is very impressive and the flowers are beautiful. We particularly liked the lego plants!

Try and go early or late to avoid some of the crowds, but even still, it's big enough to move around without too much of an issue.

It's lovely and cool in here, a welcome change from the hot and stickiness of outside!"
,,"Very cool, literally and figuratively",5.0,,"Be ready with your jackets, raincoats, and/or umbrellas upon entering Cloud Forest: it is excitingly cool inside! Going inside the Cloud Forest will refresh you; it was like going inside a fluffy cloud! I was fascinated by the falls; it was magical. Climbing up the forest was enjoyable. There were many things to see such as bizarre plants and sparkling gems and stones. At the end of the forest trip was a documentary about how Mother Earth is changing. This is a must for kids and adults alike."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is one of 2 bio-domes in the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. It is a vegetative habitat that is fun to explore. You are greeted at the entrance by several waterfalls pouring from far up the indoor mountain. An elevator takes you near to the top of the massive cone and you climb a stairway to the highest point. From there there is a walkway down to the lowest level that weaves in and out of the mountain, lush with vegetation and presenting spectacular views of the surrounding areas. The architecture of the dome itself is worth the visit. It's chilly inside the dome, especially after walking through the outdoor Gardens in the Singapore heat. If you get cold easily, bring a light jacket or sweater. The base has presentations on global warming and the environment that may (or may not) be of interest. The exit funnels you through a massive gift shop which somewhat dulls the experience. The Flower Dome is also great and very different but if you have to choose one - go for the Cloud Forest."
,,Awesome & Thrilling,5.0,,An awesome cloud forest whereby ure able to walk down the lost world. Very thrilling! Should not miss it!!!!!!!! Its jyst too awesome n eye opener whereby the only plants extinction!!! Family bonded staffs and keep it up!!! Very friendly too!!!!
,,stunning!,5.0,,"Try to go early to avoid the crowds, it is a beautiful location to view nature captured in a dome. Ramps/lifts for disabled people."
,,Lowlight of gardens by the bay.,1.0,,"A man made six story concrete tower is largely covered in rainforest plants. After queueing for a fewminutes an elevator takes you to the 2nd top floor where you take a short 20 step(maybe) climb to the lost world. A gradual walk down past other sights, but still largely focussed on the tower of plants in the middle. There are other stations hidden gardens ,stalactites, an educational ""when the world heats up movie"". This is a noisy(people noise) environment, it is not particularly beautiful,nor relaxing. If you want to photography a large variety of rain forrest plants you would enjoy it ,otherwise save your money"
,,Cloud Forest,4.0,,It is a very cooling indoor forest. I think the human made mountain is around 30 metres and there is a walkway along with it.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Worth every penny and look out for all the carvings as you go round they must have taken ages to do. the waterfall is great just to stand near and get cool after the heat outside
,,Incredible engineering and beautiful,5.0,,Amazing mountain-in-a-dome construction of waterfalls and lush cloud forest gardens and wooden sculptures. Beautiful and a must visit.
,,A pleasant place to spend 1/2 a day,5.0,,"This place is amazing, the cloud dome is a welcome relief form the heat and the display is huge. We saw the Tulip display in the flower dome. We then come back for the night light show,, while opnly 15 minutes long it is worth he time and effort"
,,Must must visit,5.0,,"Within gardens by the bay is the cloud forest and also the flower dome. Both of these are absolute must for anyone in Singapore.
It's Singapore's number one place to visit and will not disappoint.
The gardens are free but the domes cost about $28 for both.
Whole family loved this attraction, you must go!"
,,Heavenly Experience,5.0,,The beauty of the Cloud Forest is unbelievable - I am amazed as to how well they could recreate the Central American flora and feel felt like I was back in Costa Rica viewing rainforest - this is a must see when in Singapore
,,Excellent place,5.0,,Cloud forest is a great place to visit in Singapore. A really nice concept to demonstrate how living near to nature can help in sustainable development
,,amazing floral and sculpture,5.0,,"Every corner there is a hidden surprise and a gem to be found. Going in there is like letting your senses go wild. Make sure u bring your camera with you, fully charged!"
,,"Nice place, great to see things you dont see normally",5.0,,"I loved it, great for taking photos of exotic plants and weird statues.
Make sure you go right to the top and then do the walk way back down - The smells as you walk around are amazing. I really enjoyed it in here and the flower done."
,,Clouds Forest Dome,4.0,,"Awesome! Very cleverly constructed. Flowers, greenery, shrubs all luxurious. Well signposted. A credit to Singapore!"
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,It is so lovely and like a rainforest. A must-see if you like flowers and nature. It is quite expensive but that is normal for Singapore.
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,The whole venue is stunning and it is difficult to describe it adequately. Just go there and enjoy a couple of hours inside!
,,A must place to visit,4.0,,They have a presentation on why we should take care of nature as climate change is something that we should all be concern of.
,,If you need to select one dome at gardens by the bay then surely cloud forest is waht i will suggest no matter your like,5.0,,"Take the combined tickets to both the dome it would save 4$ .
do not go in a city tour to the gardens by the bay as they only give 20 mins for seeing his amazing attraction, surely the best i found in singapore.

atleast need 3 hours to c both the domes properly,"
,,Cloud forest is so beautiful- pretty flowers all around,5.0,,"Cloud forest is so beautiful- pretty flowers all around.. Very well maintained - temperature maintained as per the flowers grown.. We went at the time of Tulip flower fest.. Where we saw multiple types of tulips flowers, name any color and it was there..
Simply beautiful and very pleasing..
Beautifully made, the waterfall add to its beauty.. Amazing view from the top.. The coolness and freshness of plants makes you feel so good.. Simply pretty.."
,,Should be on To Do List,5.0,,This is one of the attraction of Gardens by the Bay Should not be missed at all. Worth a visit.Quiet Impressing .
,,Overrated.,3.0,,Its overrated. Many floors are still not fully developed. Strictly not recommended for budget travelers.
,,Took my breath away,5.0,,"Took my breath away, what a creative mind to produce and build such a place. It is so thoughtful of how people can be encouraged to enjoy nature at its best."
,,A great place - must visit.,5.0,,"You need to allocate at least 2.5 to 3 hours to enjoy this place better. Both the conservatories are great. Would propose to visit around 4pm so that one can see the cloud forest in day light as well as evening with lighting.

Once you come out of ""Marina Bay"" metro station, you could walk through the Gardens by the Bay or go in a vehicle (SGD 3 per person) to Conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome)."
,,great place,4.0,,"in the same location with flower dome, gardens by the bay... a miniature forest...first thing you saw is the man made waterfall..which is great...cool, aircon forest!!"
,,So beautiful,4.0,,"As I mentioned in my review about the gardens by the bay this is the perfect place to come when it rains. There are so many unusual plants to see and the layout is so unusual. You can walk all the way to the top of the dome and be inside the waterfall! There are lots of educational areas too which was also interesting.

Make sure you bring something warmer to wear as the air con is really strong."
,,Impressive walk within the dome,4.0,,"The entrance to the Cloud Dome is located next to the exit of the flower dome, technically, they share the same exit as both will lead to the gift shop at the end.

Once entered, you will be greeted by this massive man-made water fall. The temperature at the onset is rather chilly and refreshing compare to just right before the entrance. Great photo location too.

The main idea of the dome is to take the lift up to the top floor and have a walk down via the many sky ramps and bridges. Looking around from the top view, you can see the structure of the man-made waterfall better as well as the view outside of the dome. Clearing each level as you proceed down to the +5 degree/ secret garden, there is a slide show program that shows the water filtration of the place. Which is a good education process.

Overall, good photo opportunity and great fun"
,,Wonderful Enclosed Gardens,5.0,,"Excellent plant displays, punctuated with some very elaborate carved items the walk ways may be too high for some but well worth using to get a great view of the plants and other exhibits."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I have been here twice and it was amazing both time I went. The views from the top and all the amazing plants and flowers will astound you!
,,one of the wonders of nature,5.0,,no words to explain this fabulous experience ... not to be missed when visiting the city. Plants and flowers from all over the world in an environment and fantastic construction.
,,A must see marvel of engineering and nature combined in the Cloud Forest.,5.0,,"Enough cannot be said about the wonders found at the Cloud Forest. Just like the Flower Dome, the building housing the Cloud Forest is an engineering marvel that will impress travelers of all ages and backgrounds. Additionally, the air-conditioning was very welcomed on a hot, humid day of touring the Gardens by the Bay. The waterfalls in the Cloud Forest are a sight to behold, and the variety of plants is stunning. The exhibits are very well put together and also educational. On my visit there, most visitors were through the entire exhibit in less than forty-five minutes, while I spent around three hours enjoying this truly incredible creation.

Bring your camera because there is plenty of photo opportunities within; however, because of the number of people on the walkways, I would recommend one leave their “selfie” sticks outside and be considerate of others. Do wear comfortable shoes and clothes when visiting the Cloud Forest."
,,Stunning.,5.0,,"If visiting Gardens by the Bay (which really are ""a must""), you cannot miss the cloud Forest Dome - informative and very beautiful. Worth every penny of the entrance fee, and do not worry if your mobility is poor as you can get a lift right to the top, then stroll down - taking your time, enjoying the cool, learning a lot, and simply enjoying it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Beautiful view..cool inside...nature lovers should not miss thistourist attraction...walk way is good
,,Interesting Little Forest,5.0,,"A huge man-made tree forest with a waterfall and surrounded by greens. There was a small garden in the middle level, the architectures were amazing."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"The waterfall is very impressive, especially as it is indoors - a lot of people take photos with it at the entrance, so be aware of that.

At the end of the attraction, once you've walked all the way down, there is a short video about global warming which is worth the time."
,,Holiday Singapore,5.0,,"Simply amazing will go back again.best to go mid week,early morning then not to crowded,the dome is air cond as well"
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,From the top to the bottom and vice versa colourful and brilliant plant displays with wonderful sculptures intermingled
,,Amazing,5.0,,Late afternoon is best for visiting this amazing attraction and then visiting the Gardens afterwards when the lights are on.
,,Lost in the clouds!,5.0,,What a wonderful attraction for the city this is. We like the way you could walk the paths right up to the top of the dome where the views were great! So many flowers and plants and such a lot of work has obviously gone into it. Fascinating and well worth the entry fee!
,,A brilliant garden display,5.0,,Wonderful structure and truly beautiful experience. Be immersed in greenery and waterfalls. A must see in Singapore.
,,"Great architecture, spectacular indoor cloud forest",5.0,,Impressive architecture of the dome (building that hosts the cloud forest). It's worth paying the high entry price....
,,Unbelievable true.....,5.0,,Garden by the bay!!!! Cloud forest is a very intense thought to survive nature and build an interesting tourist attraction out of it.
,,amazing,5.0,,great experience . great look out point. stunning views . cant believe you are in a city when you walk through here
,,They built a Forest in the city,4.0,,"Cool place,lots of things to see, I love this place, you will find peace over here,it's a tourist attraction place"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The indoor waterfall is so beautiful. The whole experience was very tranquil and enjoyable. If you are there during misting times I think it is nicest on the walkway down from the Lost World. If you don't happen to be there during a misting time then don't worry, the experience is amazing anyway."
,,very interesting experience,5.0,,"Beautiful tropical plants, just enough written information, nice wooden sculptures! A wonderful place to be - truely one of a kind!"
,,Nice man-made waterfalls,5.0,,Nice man-made waterfalls which takes approximately 2 hours to explore. Need to walk throughout this place to explore by both adult and children.
,,Unique!,5.0,,If on holiday in singapore this attraction is a must do and it encompasses so much more than simply a forest. This is total sensory overload and is unique to Singapore. Not only is it a relief from the heat - it is air conditioned-but it is a chance to have a whole family moment.
,,Take a jumper,5.0,,"This is worth every dollar, you are transported to another world it felt a little like you were in a rain forest, everywhere you looked was beautiful"
,,Best Glass Green house effect,5.0,,Best Glass Green house effect and quite informative with respect to plants and flowers. Great decorations done by various artist at Cloud Forest.
,,Will come back here!,5.0,,"It was my first experience to visit Cloud Forest. I bought the ticket from one popular agency at my country. Some says, it more expensive if you buy on the spot.
When I reach Cloud Forest, it was a breathtaking! Amazing!
Try it guys, you'll never regret it.
Seriously, will coming back here!!"
,,Amazing indoor waterfall,5.0,,Visit this place at sunset and when the sun goes down. Because the light at waterfall will be turn on after sun is set. So you can enjoy 2 view at one time.
,,amazing garden in the sky,4.0,,"Try and find cheap tickets online as it can get quite pricey if you see both gardens Very relaxing, mesmerising"
,,Amazing,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is in the Gardens by the Bay. The actual gardens are free to wander around but there is a Fee for the Cloud Forest - well worth it.
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,"Singapore really have the highest appreciation to their resource and creativity. The place was wonderful, my family had a great time. But one of the hassle is that during moving up and down we need to use the elevator the small in the middle. We have to rush with other user that sometimes doesn't care about queuing at all."
,,Cloud forest was very good,4.0,,"This is well worth a visit, really enjoyed it, it's next to another dome, I wouldn't bother with that one, it's mostly an English cottage garden, it was very hot perhaps we just didn't get it."
,,"Spectacular, indeed!",5.0,,If you are visiting Gardens by the bay then don't leave without paying a visit to the cloud forest. Its a must see and will take you by surprise with what it has to offer. The lost world is the best part!
,,Great day out,4.0,,Cool climate and great plants with good views of marina bay hotel and sides of Singapore. The walkways that Spring out of the centre are quite high but offer lovely viewing of the plants and surroundings.
,,Stunning on the outside,4.0,,Walk in and the first thing you see is a 7 story stunning waterfall. Its beautiful and for the more adventurous there is a cloud walk at the top of the dome and a tree walk lower down. The lost world at the top was beautiful but the rest of the inside of the hill was a little disappointing however this cannot take away from the breathtaking view on the outside and the nice touches like the eagles head (see photo)
,,Learn about Cloud Forests - respect Nature,5.0,,"GRT indoor activity.
Educative apart from being beautiful and overwhelming in terms of architecture and splendour.
The recreation of varying temperature zones along with plants and cloud forests is touching.
The waterfall is the icing on the cake.
Learn about global warming and how cloud forests are so important to conserve.
Must do with children bet 10-15 yrs of age."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Beyond expectation and imagination. Its a must visit and should not be missed. I recommend everyone to visit this. Should spend considerable time for this. Plan a visit during the afternoon to beat the torturous Singapore heat. You need 4-5 hours to do justice to this and the flower gardens in the next dome. Plan such that you are intime for the evening view of the garden outside. Definitely a must visit.
,,Cool Experience,5.0,,"Visited here while at the Garden By The Bay. Purchased a pass for both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Though the ticket line was a bit long (went in late afternoon), the Cloud Forest itself was a unique experience and great experience. Plenty of photo opportunities not only at the large waterfalls at the entry but also along the skywalk. Great for any type of visitor, including kids and families!"
,,Out of this world.,5.0,,"This was more than I expected. Absolutely marvellous. The thought and planning behind this is mind boggling. We stayed far longer than planned, drawn in by the way nature was portrayed. The picture opps are fantastic, and I shot some 170 pics."
,,better then garden by the bay,5.0,,we visited this but very short time.. didnt had time to see fully as we have to catch cruise.. its better than garden by the bay..water fall is very nice
,,Nothing,1.0,,Nothing to see. All are artificial for me. I'm indonesian with a lot of beautiful nature in my country. This place is nothing. Bad.
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"The engineering in this is almost as inspiring as the botany of the display.

Some of the plants we battle to grow were larger than ever seen, colors are phenomenal, variety is stupendous.

The entire energy of the cloud forest is one to behold and lingers for a long time afterwards."
,,No cloud,3.0,,Have been to another one which actually had a cloud so this was disappointing. On the other hand the flowers and trees are very nice. A lot of walking with walk ways very high. Made me uncomfortable because it was crowded and the walk way seem to shake. Nothing happened but I just wanted to get off. They should really limit number of people.
,,Amazing! A must see!,5.0,,"Singapore Gardens by the Bay are amazing, a real 'must see'. Incredible really. Hours can be spent viewing the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. They are also two very welcome places where you can escape from the outside heat of Singapore as they are wonderfully air conditioned!"
,,cool and exquisite,4.0,,its cool inside and stunning water fall..amazing man made forest..take the lift to level 6 and enjoy the gardens by foot all the way down.dont miss the mist timings..watch the +5 deg show..also view the water fall lighting work at night before leaving the gardens by the bay.
,,Fresh n cool,5.0,,Is my every visit place whenever I come to Singapore. Every time I come here is something different with the flower they have. I have already fall in love this place. But I would like to annual passes but it's not available for non-Singaporean
,,a must do and it's cool,5.0,,"Over the heat then head here! Cooling area, great scenery and interesting for all. We went during the day but open in the evening too which I imagine could be pretty special too. A must do!"
,,Cool break from the heat,4.0,,"Was a nice cool break after a long day walking around the city. Some interesting local flora, well maintained. Not very crowded even though I visited on a Saturday... Perhaps time of year?"
,,A Must See !,5.0,,Loved the huge indoor waterfall and a lovely respite from Singapore's heat and humidity! We could have walked around it all day!! Great photo opportunities too. A little gem in the heart of Singapore - do go visit!!
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,Great indoor rain forest . I think this is the best indoor rain forest i have ever seen in my life. Great work. I felt like staying there for ever.
,,Magic,5.0,,Must see! Breath taking the huge indoor waterfall incredible! Did not pay for extra sky walk but no need.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"What amazing imagination to create a garden like this. Climate controlled and a great place to spend a morning or afternoon. The dome covers about two football fields, and the vegetation inside is breath taking."
,,another superlative in singapore to be visitied,5.0,,"A very welcome refreshment if you can't stand Singapores humidity and heat & a breathtaking ""staging"" of rainforests Flora. Definitely worth a visit."
,,indoor fountain in the dome,5.0,,"Just one look at the fountain in the dome situated at gardens of the bay, and you will think that you are in a tropical jungle."
,,Mandatory to travelers,5.0,,"this is artificial garden with natural touch, a lot of exotics plantation can be witnessed. There is very cool indoor waterfall that you must see. felt like in rural….don’t be rush,,enjoy your time here!"
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"The cloud forrest was not only stunning, but also a cool place that we thoroughly enjoyed in a sweaty day of sightseeing."
,,Why do it?,5.0,,"I imagine a giant starring through the glass pieces of a giant ant farm at all the little ants walking up and down a mountain with a waterfall in it, up and down, up and down - wondering what are these little ants up to.

That was my thoughts as I walked the cloud forest - you just feel small inside this massive man-made forest with the most beautiful vegetation and this towering man-made waterfall spraying over you as you walk in. Then you start your journey, ever so slowly up and round and the various walkways till you reach the top only to find a few more surprises there!

I really wasn't expecting much - I mean it’s a giant greenhouse after all but it is spectacular and worth every minute spent! Not only that it provides welcome relief from the Singapore heat and we found we easily spend 1 1/2 hours in there without realizing it. Make sure you check what times the actual clouds of the cloud forest are switched on and make sure you are at the top when it starts!

I would definitely recommend this to anyone, YES even us manly men can enjoy a garden!!"
,,FABULOUS GARDENS,5.0,,This is a great place to visit on a hot day - the temperature is controlled at a comfortable level. The planting is very creative and stunning. There is a skywalk which gives you a great view of the waterfalls and vertical planting. I thought the Eden Project was great but this is much better. It can get busy but certainly worth a visit.
,,One of the must in your agenda,4.0,,"The place really holds the key that can make you really WOW of the beautiful trees, plants until crystal that this earth provides for us.
The souvenir shop also sells a lot of beautiful things like t shirt, jewellery and plush dolls. The price is also reasonable.
If you visit Singapore, make this place as one of your choice ya.
Its romantic and awe gazer!"
,,Loved it especially the skywalk!,5.0,,We went into both of the Conservatories but this was easily my favourite. From the skywalk to the Waterfall this is an amazing place to walk around in & the lifts make it easy to get around
,,The best attraction,5.0,,I recommend this as the No.1 place to first visit in Singapore. They have created a magical forest / greenery zone with temperature control ! You will enjoy every minute inside ! Don't miss it!
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,"I have already reviewed this under Gardens by the Bay. To expand, this is one of the most amazing places I have visited. I marvelled at how it had been constructed and the most magnificent vegetation. I particularly loved the bromeliads. Another woman and I laughed that we simply could not stop taking photos! Great to take the lift up and then walk down. A fantastic lesson of what we might lose if we don't take heed of global warming."
,,Singapore must do,5.0,,Get close to nature and learn to value it by visiting this glorious place. A tribute to those with imagination to design such a place.
,,Fun walk through Different Ecosystems,4.0,,"I walked through by myself one evening, and enjoyed it. There was some nice sound-scaping and attention to creating a real feel of an environment. Poke around in the corners."
,,Jaw dropping,5.0,,Amazing way to spend several hours. Singapore does what Dubai does in being awe-inspiring but at half the price to visitors. You don't feel ripped off.
,,Great man made forest,4.0,,It is very cool inside the glass dome! The walkway above the forest is incredible. We got the sense of relaxation when we were in this dome!
,,Great to see,5.0,,"Inside the garden by the bay, cloud forest is another part of Singapore that is unique. It is very cool to walk around and see the different plants and big waterfall."
,,Singapore does it again - MAGIC!,5.0,,By far my favorite place in Gardens by the Bay - irresistibly beautiful - mesmerizing indoor waterfalls and plants.
,,Erm...okay...good thing my heart didn't drop out,3.0,,"Disclaimer: i'm not a big fan of nature.
My dad's office happens to in gardens by the bay and therefore I have a free pass to their attractions. And my wife wanted to visit the tulip mania this year.

We also went to the cloud forest, and honestly, I wasn't sure what I should be looking out for. Sure, I understood reading the explanation on the habitats and rare species of plants and animals in cloud forests. But unless you are a big nature/national geographic fan, this attraction might not be that interesting for you.

And be forewarned, the ""walking above the clouds"" is pretty scary for me, you walk 6 storey's above ground on a metal railing that has gaps showing you all the way to the ground. The center of the metal railing is covered by continuous wooden planks, but it still gave me the chills."
,,A forest in the city,5.0,,Go there and you'll feel like you are in the rain forest even though you are right in the middle of the city! Perfect!
,,Better than I expected,5.0,,I bought the tickets and actually had no idea what to expect. Walking in the waterfall greets you and instantaneously cools you down. It is informative and really amazing. I'm so happy I went. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to see something different.
,,Lovely and Cool,3.0,,After the heat of the outside the Cloud Garden is so welcome. A gushing three storey waterfall greets you as you step inside. This is a popular photo spot. Walk slowly around. Don't forget to look up to see the many plants growing on the side. Look out to see the views of the harbour. Take the lift to the upper floor and see the many insect eating plants. Come back down using the metal walkways. Walk out on the waterfall viewing platform.Take the time to listen to and watch the educational videos before walking through the secret garden. The display in the Cloud Forest is a permanent one unlike the display in the Flower Dome which changes with the seasons. You can buy tickets to the Cloud Forest near the Marina Bay Sands entrance or at the large ticket office near the domes where queues can be long.
,,WOW! Indoor Waterfalls,5.0,,The sound of the waterfalls mesmerized me right away when entering this indoor garden. Strolling through the paths was so relaxing and cool. Love it !!
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Make sure you visit this amazing garden in the middle of Singapore. It is lush, green and awe-inspiring."
,,Five out of Five,5.0,,Breathtaking architecture and a simply mind blowing idea to have a mountain inside. Nice and cool on a very hot day. Flowers etc amazing as were the wooden sculptures dotted around. Get to the top and wander down the walkways.
,,Cool place,4.0,,"For the price of a ticket you can enter this very cool greenhouse (cool in every sense of the word). You will be walking at different levels from start to finish. Some of the spots are really beautiful, like the overhanging walkways, the waterfall. It would have been more interesting if more variety of the plants is showcased there. The limestone exhibition at the middle level is a bit out-of-place to me. All in all, the place is worth the ticket price."
,,"Interesting, almost like going up a cool mountain",4.0,,"temperature is pretty cool, worth a one time visit, do bring your jacket, it's a bit cold there. you can see many plants that grow on high altitude"
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"It's a really cold place. But this place is amazing, it really looks like a real forest with rich biodiversity. It was nice feeling walking in the sky walk. I can't tell if this place is better than the Flower dome as we did not visit it but I;m sure kids and kids at heart will enjoy here. Worth a visit."
,,Beautiful indoor garden,4.0,,"We purchased our ticket at the airport together with a combo ticket to Universal Studios. Worked out cheaper this way. Glad we did as it was definitely worth the visit. Queues were well managed so there were no delays in accessing the gardens.
Beautiful indoor waterfall and green tower you can walk up to admire."
,,Good cool place,5.0,,The dome contains all the plants from mountain regions. A good walk around the whole place takes upto 2 hours. they even have the carnivorous plants as well.
,,Boring Park. No Chance For Re-visit.,2.0,,"Visited Flower Dome before going next door to see The Cloud Forest.

See a 7th storey waterfall pouring down. Walked through the tropical forest before taking a lift to Level 7 to start the descending to see the different type of vegetation in the forest. See the different types of stones too. Boring!

Nothing so special (lack the pull factor) and unlikely to visit again; unless foreign visitors in town.

There's no reason for a re-visit unless more interesting things added."
,,Wonderful attraction,5.0,,Great place to visit but it is cold inside so take a wrap of some sort. It can get a bit crowded though
,,Incredible,5.0,,"The biggest indoor waterfall I have ever seen, like the eden project but 10 times bigger. Takes forever to get to the top (worse if you have a push chair and have to wait for lifts) but worth it,"
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,The best part of the attraction. Cool and spacious. The skywalk was wonderful &very safe. Well worth the 28dollars for both domes
,,"Very crowded during the weekend, but nice to see",3.0,,Place very crowded during the weekend but definitely cooler than on the outside so nice to see for a family walk
,,wonderful,5.0,,"my preferred of the two domes - has so much to offer - views, plants, climate, art and education. truly wonderful and a break from the heat."
,,Gob smacking beautiful,5.0,,"Take the lift up into the clouds and slowly wander downwards as you marvel at the beauty and the effort that has gone into the construction of these gardens. Just do it. Yes, it does cost a few dollars, but hey, you can't take it with you. Enjoy."
,,Refreshing activity after a walk across the Gardens,4.0,,"We loved the helicoid walk around the ""small"" rainforest mountain. It provided for a peaceful and refreshing walk after the punishing heat of the outside gardens."
,,Mountain where there's none. Well done Lion City!,5.0,,"It's the closest to a mountain feel. There's this breezy man made atmosphere with rain like features from a man made fountain that feels just like a cool mountain.

Singapore needs more places like this so that those who reside in high rise buildings have a way of escape into the floral and fauna, man made howbeit. You can walk up or be wheeled up or you could just take the lift. This is where Singapore is first world and first class.

Lime stones, like the ones in Batu Caves were on display in a cave like environment. Got me thinking how much we take for granted the lush rainforest nature we have in Malaysia.

Be sure to wear some warm clothes when you're here. It's one place you may want to visit over and over."
,,"the moment you enter the cloud forest, it wows you.",4.0,,A must see in Singapore! The Architecture with its waterfall and the walkway at the heights is a experience.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,We loved the cloud forest- you start off at the bottom of the waterfall and then make you way up to the top of it to then wind your way back down with various vantage points to look down at the waterfall crashing far below you. It has been really well designed and was a great day out.
,,Unforgettable memory,5.0,,I strongly suggest to people who.like nature and enjoy water and plants. Everything is perfect and so clean. I feel like I can stay there forever
,,best conservatory i have visited,4.0,,"so i am not a a very conservatory visiting person, but this one was quite good, it has been made in a very interesting fashion. it is temperature controlled. and themed around a tropical forest. they have a huge waterfall which forms the center piece. dont forget to carry a light jacket and go during the day"
,,Just wow!,5.0,,"When i first entered the door of the cloud forest, the first thing that will great you is the cool mist of the forest. Its so amazing that you cant help but to say wow! Its unimaginable how they were able to construct the cloud forest plus how they planted all those beautiful flowers and plants. You will walk around it while it leads you up till you reach the peak of it. There were mist to water the plants so it gives you the vision like you were walking on clouds. There is also a garden on the center on top of it which makes it more amazing. Its a must to visit cloud forest when you are in Singapore, I'm glad i was able to book this tour. Me and my mom enjoyed it a a lot. You may spend 1.5-2hrs to enjoy the forest."
,,Things don't really change here,3.0,,I would go to the flower dome again but I don't think I want to visit the cloud forest as I don't see any changes.
,,Excellent time spent in this place!,5.0,,"Well worth the money spent to get inside, even though Singapore is the most expensive city in the world (Currently!) The flowers and plants were a multitude of colours and a wonderful sight to see."
,,Escape the heat in style,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the greenhouses of the complex Gardens By The Bay, the other one being Flower Dome. I recommend both of them. Cloud forest has the largest collection of bromeliad under a roof in the world! There is a manmade waterfall and guests can reach the top by elevator and then walk the way back, and it's also wheelchair friendly. The best time to visit is around 5 pm, because then you can enjoy both greenhouses under 2 hours and then head to the skywalk at the super trees for the sunset. No need to do reservations a,d there is a combo ticket for both greenhouses."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is definitely the better of the two domes at The Gardens by the Bay. The plants are beautiful, the sky walk through the dome is alot of fun. The first thing you have to do when you enter the dome, is stand under the waterfall. So cool and refreshing! Stop to watch the video towards the end of the dome, its a very interesting film."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We enjoyed the cloud forest, it is well worth the entry fee more so than the adjacent flower dome (in our opinion). Look to spend at least 2 hours to see it all and take in the sights."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This dome is an amazing walk through a rainforest. From above the tree tops all the way down to the bottom of a towering waterfall. Loved it all. This is accessible for wheelchairs and strollers as well, so anyone can enjoy this experience."
,,Oasis in the heart of the city,5.0,,"One gets transported into a different world from the excruciating heat when one walks through the entrance. A majestic man made (obviously) waterfall greets the beholder, temperature dips by 10 degrees Celsius... the flora mount and sky walk around the mould make this attraction a truly one of its kind in this part of the world.
The respite from the afternoon heat in an almost natural setting makes this attraction one of my favorites."
,,"Beautiful mountain, waterfall, flowers.. ect ect",4.0,,"This will surprise you as you enter the dome. The man maid misty mountain and the waterfall is just amazing. The tracks which leads out of the mountain on the top gives you a superb view. A must watch!

It could get really cold inside so better be prepared."
,,Nice place to chill out,5.0,,I didn't expect the cloud forest is so nice. We walked for long time for sightseeing so the forest make us so relax. Nice landscape and lots of water and green. It feels like we are in the different world.
,,Utopian dream comes true,5.0,,Awesome greenery with vertical gardens and futuristic structure. Great place for photography a bit confusing to navigate though.
,,Gardens by the bay --Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Waterfalls and a nice walk down through a cloud forest....beautiful blooms and views....
Buy a combo ticket tor the flower dome and the cloud forest. You can get your hand stamped for same day return. Both domes are bordered by the bay on one side and acres of gardens on the other."
,,Chilling : Literally,5.0,,"The moment you entire the cloud forest, the gush of air hitting your body chills you completely.There is man made waterfall just at the entrance which is mesmerizing, a great place to get wonderful snaps.The elevator takes you the 7th floor from where the view of entire cloud forest, Marina Bay Sands & the Singapore Flyer is a delight to watch..The entire area is made to like a forest with theme based designs on each floors.
Do not miss this attraction."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This cloud forest had so many incredible things. For starters, the engineering in this place was unbelievable. Secondly, the plants they used in such a concentrated area was mind blowing. If you love tropical plants, SEE THIS PLACE!"
,,Oasis in the middle of the city,5.0,,We got there on a wet day so it was good to get away from the rain. We had 1-2 hours to spend so end up picking this one instead of the Flower dome. Nice and cool inside the dome. The whole place was impressive! It has to be one of the best indoor garden in the world. Be prepared to do a bit of walking but we managed with 4 kids in tow.
,,Nice and Cool inside with allsorts to see,5.0,,Go inside and see the man made waterfalls. There are plants everywhere seemingly growing out of the concrete. It is cool and a respite from the heat outside. Compared to the other dome it was not not mobbed and the whole thing was very well out together. Well worth a visit.
,,"good, must do",5.0,,visit day time so that u can see d beauty and click beautiful pics. you shud do cloud forest as it is unique in it.

,,amazing,5.0,,"loved this part of gardens by the bay, so beautiful. Love the walkway among the trees and the huge waterfall, which you can stand behind once you reach the top. Well worth seeing"
,,A high point!,5.0,,"I thought the Flower Dome was going to be the highlight of our visit to the Gardens by the Bay, but the Cloud Forest was the high point in more than one way. It is an artificial mountain covered with foliage and supporting an incredible number of paths and view points, not to mention the very high waterfall. You have to admit that when Singapore does something, they do it well! This is not to be missed!"
,,"temperature controlled, green house with a tropical forest theme",5.0,,"cloud forest is a dome shaped green house with a tropical forest theme. the main attraction is the huge waterfall over which they have done vertical gardening. we went here in the evening. we started from the top, ie the lost world, then through cloud walk to the cavern. from here we went to the point from where u can seen the entire waterfall from the top - this view is stunning!. further down there is a show on earth check and +5 degree..it takes about 30-40 minutes to cover the entire dome. entry fee is SGD 16 for just the forest dome, coupled with flower dome, it is SGD 28"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Stunning architecture. It is a must see on your visit to Singapore, be prepared to walk. The waterfall is a big highlight, and is very refreshing after being outside in the Singapore heat."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"The architecture alone is worth visiting this place! The backdrop of all the other structures around it which you can see through the glass, is what makes it a must see!"
,,Signature Waterfall,5.0,,One of the best places for a good selfies/wefies. The waterfall is where you can capture a lovely picture but this place can be chilly and wet.
,,Cloud Forest,4.0,,"Got this on a complimentary ticket and unsure what is the usual pricing per person. However it was nevertheless a good experience and great to see the various plants presented in a interesting manner. As a local, wont pay more than twenty dollars from this, and if given a choice, I would prefer the flower dome over this. :)"
,,Great cool indoor forest,5.0,,"Lots of beautiful spots for photos a lovely forest which is nice and cool which is indoors , you do have to pay but worth the money"
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Amazed by the beauty and architecture of this place. It is a must see on your visit to Singapore, be prepared to walk, but there is a lift for the not so agile.The waterfall is certainly a highlight, and is so refreshing after being outside in the Singapore heat."
,,Must see. Truely amazing,5.0,,Was a little hesitant to go but was glad we did. Amazing displays and not something you'll likely see again. Highly recommend for any age group even if you have no interest in plants. Buy your entry ticket from your hotel as it is $7 cheaper.
,,Cool and refreshing,5.0,,"The place is a haven for those overheating in the singapore heat and humidity. Very nice place and cost effective. They have a wide range of ferns, moss and plants. The architectural design is superb. Not for people scared of heights."
,,Very educational,4.0,,My husband and I both enjoyed the cloud forest and we gained more understanding of how the clouds help control our ecosystem. We enjoyed seeing all the different plants and the different zones such as the lost world and the secret garden. This is worth seeing although we didn't spend as long here as we did in the flower dome.
,,Incredible,5.0,,Spent several hours here. Beautiful gardens and the cloud forest is spectacular. It's a long way up but there is a lift if needed for tired legs.
,,Impressive,4.0,,"This dome is very impressive. As soon as I entered this dome, the giant waterfall spellbound me. Walk up and then down the cloud forest was a great experience."
,,Incredible Design,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore just beautiful and a great place to cool off from the intense heat. Husband not great at visiting gardens but was really impressed and loved the visit
,,Excerllant,5.0,,This was an amazing place the cloud forest was fantastic never seen any thing to match it Plenty to do for the day Good food places fair price and nice Toilets immaculate Well worth a trip
,,Rain Forest in the city,4.0,,"Amazing flora and fauna in a stunning glass structure. A must if you visit Garden by the Bays. It's surprisingly cool inside, so do bring a light cardigan."
,,Amazing Tourist Attraction!!,5.0,,"Never anticipated such a greeny, Nature dominated area at the heart of the city!! Awe is the one word we can say!! It's mind blowing to see how they maintain the nature and the temperature at cloud forest!! Must to visit!!"
,,Must visit !!,5.0,,"Awesome place to visit! it just feels wow, when you enter this place. DONT MISS! Worth the dollars spent!"
,,Great for summer outing!,4.0,,"Touring Gardens by the Bay may not be too appealing as it has been scorching hot at the moment. But wait till you try the Cloud Dome! It seems like you will be transported in a totally different place as it has such an amazing ambience and very crisp atmosphere! It is very refreshing to visit! You can also stay for as long as you like inside. It will be worth it than to just roam around malls. Great for nature lovers too, loads of photo opportunities!"
,,The Beauty Of The Rain Forests.....!,5.0,,"Please do visit it when you are in Singapore, they have an amazing collection of flora and fauna of the rain forests and the water fall is mesmerising."
,,Amazing site,5.0,,Singaporeans closest gardens that easily beat the Eden project. The indoor waterfall is beyond belief and a great way of cooling down. So many exotic species of plants to see. The whole site is lite up at night in a wonderful show
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"You must see this attraction! A complete different World in a dome. Very interesting also for Kids. Don't hurry, take your time for it."
,,state of the art!,5.0,,"amazing tourist attraction, never seen this before, a nature in the center of the city! i really love it!"
,,beautiful place,5.0,,It is an artificial garden well maintained and very beautiful. One of important visiting place in Singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a stunning place and a must visit for anyone visiting Singapore. It is like nowhere I have been before and a great chance to get a break from the heat. Try go when it is being misted as it looks awesome
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"It was a relaxing moment when I visit Cloud Forest. You can see the beauty of rainforest while relaxing in a bench and listening to the sound of falling water. There's a bridge circling the man-made waterfall and huge plants pillar where you can actually experience walking in actual rainforest. However, since there's sprinkling water in most place, you may consider wearing casual or sport attire and watch your children in case of slipping. Anyway, while you walk on the bridge, take a look outside and see the beauty of Marina Bay. I recommend you to came here in the afternoon when it's sunny."
,,Imaginative,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the three main attractions in the Gardens at the Marina. On entering at the “ground floor” the visitor is confronted with what I believe is the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. It is certainly a relief to enjoy the cool atmosphere in the huge dome. One is directed to the other side of the dome where you ride the elevator to the 6th floor. From there you make you way slowly along a walkway as you descend through the cloud foresr, encountering new plant species and a different flora as you go. I timed my visit to coincide with the bi-hourly misting of the whole environment. This gives you the realistic feeling of being in a cloud.

I must admit I did not pay too much attention to the additional exhibits and only quickly reviewed the video show back at ground level plotting the disaster scenario of eventual global warming. From this story one emerges into the extensive souvenir shop which seemed to be doing a roaring trade on that day that I was there. I was pleased to see that there were plenty of free toilet facilities available together with a drinks/snack kiosk offering reasonably priced soft drinks."
,,"Unique use of plants, carvings & waterfalls !",5.0,,"Blown away immediately the minute we stepped through the doors, by the wall of waterfall & the sound which follows you throughout as you wind round this unique construction. If the water features don't charm, then the skywalks I'm certain will. They give it that unique cloud vision of looking down through the waterfall, through the hanging plants into green & colour. They also allow you a panoramic view of Singapore quite unique through the glass dome. Wonderful addition."
,,Magnificent,4.0,,"The 35-metre waterfall was just spectacular. It was so amazing standing there looking upwards.

It was cool and misty as you walk along looking at such a wide variety of plants from different species (1 million plants from 5,000 species).
The Cloud Walk and Treetop walk was so interesting that we did not realise we were so high up.

It's a great place to visit for the young n old."
,,An Amazing Place to Visit,5.0,,"My wife and I visited Gardens-by-the-Bay during a two stay stopover in Singapore. Ann is slightly disabled and facilities for her were very good. There was a shuttle bus around the park and for SGD$2.00 we hired a wheelchair to visit the two glass houses. We were bowled over at the planning and execution of this project and the amount of flowers, bushes and trees to be seen were fantastic.
A must-see for any visitor to Singapore who likes flora."
,,Just amazing.,5.0,,The cloudwalk is simply unbelievable and a must do. Take the lift to the top and stroll back down and prepare to be stunned.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore. It is jaw dropping what the accomplished indoors. You really feel as if you are walking in the clouds.
,,A must!,5.0,,"One of the best things to see in Singapore, it's truly amazing! Go at night time, waterfall and walkway are lit up."
,,Average experience,3.0,,"Theres a relatively narrow walkaway that leads through the whole forest , which is crowded with mostly old people so it can get really annoying. Nice artificial forest though."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"This is a beautiful place, well-planned, and worth the money. Great for children, and a nice place to spend during the afternoon. The fall was simply beautiful and cooling. It's not bone-biting cold, so you don't need to bring along a jacket. We thought that 30 minutes is enough to cover the entire place, but we were wrong. There are so many unique plants, art carvings, and natural stones. We spend about 1.5 hours in the Cloud Forest. At the exit, there is an awesome display of global warming."
,,Fascinating place,4.0,,Lots of fun to explore. An amazing concept. Lots of different layers to see. It's surpringly cold in there
,,Love it,4.0,,"To me, the place was created to look like a ruin with amazing plants grow around it. The waterfall is good and the whole place is air - conditioned, so I enjoyed walking around it, especially the weather outside was so hot.

The place is actually quite small but the ticket was quite pricy, so, be stay there longer if time allowed."
,,It Will Amaze You,5.0,,Love Love Love this! Worth the money and will delight everyone in your family! The design of this wondrous place will amaze you and walking behind the waterfall was fantastic.
,,Worth the entrance fee,5.0,,An amazing and very well laid out exhibit. To see all the different flowers and enjoy the refreshing atmosphere in such a great setting is wonderful. My family had a great time wondering around and seeing all the different levels.
,,It's a Cool Forest!!,4.0,,Good place to hang out especially in our hot tropical weather. Good exploration on plants not just for the kids but adults. Enjoyed the walk down on suspension bridges with great views. Definitely worth a visit though many claimed that it is a man-made forest!!
,,Away from the blazing sun!,4.0,,The place is fully covered under controlled environment to make the surrounding humid all year round.
,,Just incredable,5.0,,This had my mouth gaping the whole time. It is so far in the future that the mind boggles. If you think its just about plants then think again. You will be awe inspired we had 3 hours there and that still didn't cover the whole thing. It is worth it to pay for a guided trip on the trolley before you actually go into the domes as they explain the whole mechanics of the place.
,,Such a beautiful place,5.0,,"This place is amazing, I had my elderly mother with me who finds it hard to walk, but it was ok as there is a lift to the top ! The views are stunning and there are plenty of photo opportunities. The gardens are very well maintained and the whole dome is air-conditioned! It would not be a whole day activity but to fill in an hour or so it is perfect and you can get the hop of hop off tour bus to this location."
,,excellant,5.0,,highlight of singapore visit apart from marina bay sands area this is near the hotel and fun to visit...amazing structure worth the admission ..you can do this on the same day as other attraction nearby
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"The indoor waterfall was great! The design of this Cloud Forest is futuristic. When i was there, there was a short movie celebrating earth day, climate change, and how Singapore use clean energy. It's pretty interesting"
,,Stunning and well worth visiting!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was a highlight for my friend and I, we arrived at dusk allowing the plants (growing around and up a seven story artificial mountain) to be viewed in the daylight and later on in the dark. The second of these proving to be the most wonderful, as the plants and cascading waterfall off the mountain side become light up in a vast variety of differing colors. The plants themselves are viewed from a suspended walkway which start on the 7th level (accessed by an elevator) and slowly spirals down and around the mountain. Although very pleasent at first the temperature change from the hot/humid outside to the cool/moist inner climate of the doom did cause us to start feeling cool towards the end of our visit - so I would recommend packing a warm jumper/top to take with you!

We didn't book our tickets in advance for this, instead just turned up at the ticket booth at around 18:00 on a Monday. We found that there was no queueing required and that the Cloud Forest was itself nicely empty (allowing the peaceful nature of the place come through).

Well worth visiting."
,,Fun for a rainy day!,4.0,,"Our kids had a great time running around in here. They learned about different plants, stalagmites and stalactites, and about how we need to take care of the earth."
,,Cold and wet,5.0,,"Luckily there is a lift that brings us right to the top and from there, slowly we walk down on suspension bridges round and round the tower. Scenery: outside - Singapore waterway and inside - flowers, just beautiful.."
,,Changing all the time,5.0,,This was our third visit to the Gardens by the Bay and we never tire of visiting - they are so special and change constantly as they mature.
,,Amazing experience. Not just for plant lovers !!!,5.0,,"Must when visiting Singapore!!!! Blew my husband and I away, it was mind blowing. When Singapore does something it does it very well."
,,Great place to visit for a garden experience but with climate control ;),4.0,,Raining? Too Hot? Too Hazy? This is a great place to visit if you're interested in plants and looking for a garden to visit without having to worry about the weather conditions. Remember to take a photo on the metal bridge to get a great view of the skyline as your backdrop
,,Garden of Eden in Singapore,5.0,,"Visiting Singapore and not seeing the Cloud Forest is like going to Sydney Australia and not seeing the harbour and the harbour bridge. Simply put, it is a MUST see location. An amazing greenhouse experience and well worth the price of entry. Not only is it a truly amazing place to walk through it is also a fantastic relief from the oppressive heat and humidity that can be Singapore at certain times of the year. What ever your itinerary, what ever your group size or composition do yourself a favour and go take a look. Also while you are in the vicinity there are some other worthy attractions within a very short distance so it is easy enough to spend a day in an around this district."
,,Into the highlands,5.0,,"A must visit to cloud forest ,one of the indoor observatories with air conditioning in gardens by the Bay . To avoid Long queues at the ticketing counter ,online booking is a faster way to go. At the entrance of the cloud forest you are greeted by the tallest indoor waterfall in the world at 35 m high. Featuring all the flora & fauna from the highlands it's definitely a treat as you take a trail up to the canopy walk accessible by lifts to the TOP & get a bird's eye view of the place. Make your way to the canopy walk via a Long & winding bridge.What I love as well is the mist that comes out every 2 hours in the cloud forest transforming the place into a mystical place. However, I would not recommend this place for people who has vertigo ( fear of heights) because from the TOP you have to take the canopy walk along the bridge & it can be quite an ordeal for people with fear of heights. Any time you are scared just retrace your steps & take the lifts down to the 1st level & head to flower dome instead."
,,Walking among the clouds,5.0,,"Entering the Cloud forest, one is transfixed by the sight of waterfalls , the greenery and cool weather. We are suddenly transported to real dense forest with spray from the falls adding to the magic. We saw number of flowers and plants that we have never seen before. Well-managed paths starting from the top makes you feel that you are really among the clouds. In my books, this place is must-see if you are in Singapore"
,,Worth Visiting,4.0,,"The design is pretty special. When you go in, you will feel like entering into the movie Avatar. Though it's a bit small, or gives you a very special feelings. Especially, when it's very hot, it's so cooling inside."
,,Heavenly and otherworldly,5.0,,"If you're looking for an entirely different garden experience, this is the place to visit. An exciting place for plant fanatics."
,,Cloud forest dome,4.0,,"My partner and I went into the cloud forest dome during the day and once more at night for a different experience (see pictures). If you want to do the same, remember to ask the staff for re-entry at the exit. There is a height element (walking on a 7-storey bridge) which can be scary for some. Overall, it was a nice and educational experience."
,,Nice air conditioned glass dome,4.0,,It's quite a nice place to visit in Singapore. Ticket can be purchased together with flower dome. Suitable for families.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,Beautiful! The variety of plants and the whole design of the Cloud Forest is amazing. Don't forget to take a camera as there are spectacular botanical array's around every corner.
,,Very good,4.0,,Cloud forest is one of the must visit places in Sg. Go to the top and start walking down. You get to see waterfall and amazing plants. Must visit.
,,This is breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,There isn't a vertical garden like it in the world and after the humidity of outside it is refreshing.
,,Wow,5.0,,Best place for a tourist to visit specially for couples Nice view Felt wonderful and worth it paying
,,For All Ages,5.0,,A must do when in Singapore. My teenage kids even enjoyed it. A welcome respite from the heat as well. Really well done.
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,This was part of Garden by the bay pass and its also a very beautiful place. It had multiple stories and the top floor was simply amazing.
,,Truly Amazing!!!,5.0,,"My kid went berserk with joy. It was quite an experience. Advisable to book tickets online, as at times the Q is too long."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Great place to visit, perfect for a rainy day! I enjoyed the cloud forest much more than the flower dome as it feels like there is much more to see. Take a sweater, it's cold in there!"
,,A must when in Singapore!!!,4.0,,We really liked this conservatory and having been to a lot of the countries that the plants they have there they have done there research!!!
,,Step into a different world,5.0,,"The effect is rather shocking when you suddenly step into a cool rain forest from a tropical climate. The temperature decreases the way, as if we would climb up higher and higher onto a mountainside. Magnificent waterfalls provide the spectacle and the proper humidity. The vegetation of the individual floors also varies according to altitude. Ferns, rare orchids delight the eye. The view is beautiful from everywhere, but certainly from the top floor is the most spectacular."
,,Dreamy,5.0,,Must visit place.. its just something that you have never seen before. We all loved it.. Would go again soon.
,,Brilliantly Built,5.0,,Brilliantly built! Imagination is at its best. Man made falls is really a great visit. If you have time you can climb all the way to the top if not you can lift too. Definitely a worth visit.
,,Great work!,4.0,,Cloud forest is a beautiful place to visit and the water fall is just amazing I had a very good walk inside . Maybe just a bit to expensive and no student special price .
,,Cloud-tastic!,5.0,,"This place was awesome!! It's a multilevel self tour thru the different aspects of a rain forest. There's a cool waterfall, cool rock formations, and interesting, yes really, educational info along the way. Totally a highlight of the trip! And it's air conditioned. Worth the $$!"
,,Forest in the Center of Garden by The Bay,4.0,,"As we enter the Cloud Forest, it was really cold and you'll be fascinated by the colorful huge waterfall inside. :) Feels like your in a real forest with the background sounds of chirping birds and you will enjoy a lot while walking in the bridge, and aside from that you will see marina bay sands from afar inside the Dome cause it's transparent. Overall, it looks very natural."
,,Best attraction by far,5.0,,This attraction is one of the best. It's really a must to visit. I totally enjoyed every prat of it. Every flowers tress and the falls too!
,,Average but deserves a visit.,3.0,,It's a good attraction to visit but what takes away the charm is the way pipes and other fittings of the waterfall protrude out and makes it look not very natural. The change of climate inside is pleasant. Not very wheelchair friendly.
,,Best dome in Gardens,4.0,,In my opinion this is the best dome in the Gardens by the Bay. There is a huge waterfall inside. The dome is big and nice. Best part is that it is very cooling inside.
,,You'll spend hours here,5.0,,"There's something about this place that will keep you fascinated for hours, walking around and enjoying the sound of the water."
,,A must,4.0,,"We got in early at 9am as soon as it opens.
This is one you don't want to miss.
Not only do you get to see awesome plants but you also see a great view of Singapore as well.
Bring a jumper or a rap as it is a bit chilly inside.But well worthwhile."
,,Still fantastic,5.0,,"This was our second visit to the cloud and it was still an amazing experience. There is a wide array of plants and they are housed in a stunning dome, which is a fantastic piece of architecture. The aerial walkways provide fantastic views,"
,,nice,4.0,,"it was a good view inside, well arranged. in the afternoon, there was rainbow around the man-made waterfall. ticket was quite expensive."
,,Tropical heaven.,5.0,,"We spent several hours in this fascinating haven, marvelling at the ingenuity of construction and design. It is easy to access all levels and with every step a new wonder is revealed. The temperature outside was stifling, so it provided welcome respite as well."
,,Not good with elders,3.0,,Prepare closed shoes. Floors are wet on the first floor. Go early morning so you won't get to be with a large group. Go straight to the top floor where the view is all that matters.
,,Up in a cloud. Another magic creation by the Singaporians.,5.0,,"As readers you have probably already worked out Singapore is one of my favourite destinations. I have been comming back ever since I spent my honeymoon here in 1977. Why? Because it is ever changing, they continually develop attractions like Cloud Forest, attractions that defy belief, attractions which like Cloud Forest highlights their creativeness. I loved it, it is mesmerizing, it's a beautiful place to spend a couple of hours looking at the most amazing collection of plants and flowers. I spent a fair amount of time just watching the water cascading, I loved the mist and spray. The sound of water seems to create this calmness in you.
If you are afraid of hieghts then you might find the view from the top of the fall a little daunting but hey give it a go it is simply amazing!"
,,Take me to the clouds,5.0,,"If you only are for a short stay in the area and dont have time to experince the real thing in Malaysia this is a great place. For me it was the best dome of the 2, since the hanging garden is magnificent"
,,Amazing,4.0,,Amazing experience in the City centre area still. Near to the Singapore flyer wheel. Well spent time and a real eye opener.
,,"Visit to the Tulip Garden in the Air Conditoned Dome at Garden by the Bay, Singapore",5.0,,"My wife and I celebrated our 41st Anniversary by a short afternoon visit to the April- MAY 2016, to the pedigree Tulip Garden at the Garden by the Bay in the Marina Bay Gardens in Singapore.
Although outdoors the temperature was 36 degrees C, it was cool inside the air conditioned Dome containing the full blossoms of tulips from the many pedigree and "" royal"" stocks from Europe, the Middle East and the rest of the world. A board gave a description of where these beautiful tulips came from .

In the cool environment , and on a wheel chair , we were able to come up close to the tulips, and also scented roses and the rambling roses .

There was the calm, the beauty and to some background Middle Eastern music , we went round the garden,
The ticketing officer was very helpful and been a Pioneer Citizen my ticket was S$4 when it is normally $12. Helpful young guards helped us. It was well spent two hour visit.

Facilities were user friendly with lifts for the disable. Wheel chairs could be rented at S$2. each on a first come first served.
We would recommend visitors to it."
,,nature,5.0,,"This was by far a highlight of my trip. It was wonderful to start at the top and walk down thru all the levels of a cloud forest, what an amazing experience. Full of flowers and vegetation from all over Asia. Also to experience the waterfall ..great memories and got great views of Singapore as well"
,,Well worth the entry fee,5.0,,"Breathtaking views from the moment you walk through the door. The Cloud Forest is also completely air conditioned, which is a nice reprieve from the relentless Singapore heat. Make sure you make your way all the way to the top, majority of the walkways and viewing platforms offer great photo opportunities of many of Singapore's icons."
,,Very interesting.,5.0,,"Plenty of exotic plant species including the pitcher plants and lots of lovely wood carvings dotted around. Try and catch the ""misting up"" times for a bit more atmosphere."
,,Great indoor activity,4.0,,Was a really nice thing to do. I'd allow at least an hour to explore it properly. Lots of lovely plants and flowers and the indoor waterfall was really cool.
,,Beutifull,4.0,,It's beutifull place and enjoyable. The temperature cool so you not tired to walking around. The kids will be happy too. Because they get new knowledges about plant.
,,you wont belive this!!,5.0,,"man made waterfall with flowers growing all over it, the high walkway was for me quite terrifying but has to be done!! as part of the Gardens of the Bay it is amazing feat of engineering and beautiful too!"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Great garden, it made me appreciate wild flora in Ireland, as many of the plants grow wild here,cloud walk a bit scary, if you have issues with being up high. Well worth a visit"
,,Fantastic waterfall,5.0,,"The design and all the planting are amazing, they all look natural, healthy plant and amazing. thumbs up for all people who made this happened. wonderfull :)"
,,Amazing,5.0,,It's not the waterfall when you enter this beautiful place but seeing the gardeners working with harnesses on doing their daily work and how they keep these gardens so beautiful that make this such a special place. You have to see it to believe it real. Just feel in love with it
,,Rain Forest indeed!,5.0,,"As soon as you enter you see a huge man-made waterfall amidst a lot of forest-ey plants. Pleasing to your eyes, enormous variety of plants and flowers. Highly educational and a delightful experience.

Advisable to go all the way up (on the lift maybe) and climb down the hill; all the way down, admiring the different plants with the view of the waterfall from different sides."
,,"Boring place, not much to see",2.0,,There's an artificial waterfall at the entry. Looks similar to those waterfalls you can find in big shopping malls. Then you can hike up and see the waterfall from the top. Then you've seen it pretty much all. There's a place with stalactites but it's not like a cave or something. It's just a display with few stalactites and fake sound of water drops coming out of the speakers. There's also a cinema where they talk about Global warming. They use a lot of electricity to run this place which actually makes global warming worse.
,,Impressive,5.0,,Its amazing and impressive. A great attraction added to the many Singapore has. Great set-up and a VERY impressive waterfall makes it a great overall experience. Strongly recommend
,,Fake but still amazing,4.0,,"It's a bit like entering a dream, especially when the artificial fog is switched on. It's almost convincingly real. But alas it's all for show and to impress tourists. Fake but beautiful. ."
,,As near to Nature even if man made,5.0,,"So very peaceful inside, have to return to experience it again. We walked in just as it was time for the mist to happen."
,,A must not only for tourists but locals as well,4.0,,The cloud forest has been specially designed to give visitors a unique experience. The crystal forest as I call it shows the wonders of nature. The unique landscape so well architectured provides the visitor an experience one could not imagined coupled with the cool temperature kept at a constant level. In the cloud forest visitors are presented with different species of plants and especially the array of flowers found only in the tropical forest. The man made simulated tree top walk also gives the faint hearted a chance to experience it. Come and have a experience of a lifetime... a walk through a tropical jungle right in the middle of the Central Business District of Singapore. The cloud forest is wheel-chair friendly with numerous elevators placed strategically for the benefit of the visitors. A place worth to visit. Please note that only Senior citizens (Singaporeans and Singapore PRs)( pay a subsidised entrance fee)
,,Beautiful and exquisite!,5.0,,"Wonderful experience for visiting the Cloud Forest! It feels like another world - lost world inside it. Thanks to the wonderful works by the staffs inside, we saw workers maintaining the forest by hanging themselves on the cliff. It was a wonderful experience and would definitely love to go back and visit again."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Another fantastic visit, as this was closed for maintenance last year we thoroughly enjoyed our visit this year, would recommend as a must."
,,Part and parcel do Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Absolutely stipunning, but not for people afraid of heights. The lift takes you to the top, but then you have to take the walkway down. However, you can possibly overcome your fear of heights by just being amazed at the flowers."
,,Food nice and good.,4.0,,Been there with friends to had lunch. Really good service and food is good. The lobsters and crabs must try.
,,Stunning waterfall,5.0,,"The worlds highest indoor waterfall, beautiful flowers and interesting rainforest plants. I cannot believe somebody described this as boring !!!"
,,A cool place for the hot days,4.0,,"The place is very interesting and it shows how Singapore arrange their energy and water system. However, the place is very cold. Suggesting to wear a coat or jacket."
,,"MOST Impressive From Bottom, But HIKE UP Too!",5.0,,"If you're rushed for time (first of all, relax, you're in a freaking garden wonderland!!) then at the very least make your way in and stand in front of the waterfall and marvel at this man-made craziness. If you're here for the day and want to feel like you're wandering some tropical path through the mountains and trees, then walk up to the top, it's an easy stroll. At the very top there is a little pond to sit and relax and dozens of different orchids everywhere you look. For some reason I'm not as impressed looking down as looking up, but it's a real treat experiencing the amazing gardening acumen that went into this! :)"
,,Beautiful and educational!,5.0,,"Some of the most beautiful plants and flowers we've ever viewed and all inside this dome of an enclosed botanical mountain! This flowering oasis is a welcome departure from the gardens outside because the entire dome is cooled so you can spend hours inside being amazed at all the beauty. You are able to travel around the mountain of flowers, which includes waterfalls as well, and inside the mountain, as well as high above the botanical mountain. And inside this green forest mountain at the bottom is an eye opening educational experience on Earth's climate change and it's effects. Do not miss the Cloud Forest because it is spectacular!"
,,They will be in nature with air conditioner .,5.0,,- best of the best in the world for hanging gardens . - You will find many beautiful and rare flowers . - Do not forget to take your camera with you .
,,the whole lot was fantastic,5.0,,This is a must for anybody visiting Singapore. The walk and displays are so of the best tourist attractions in Singapore
,,Superb place to see variety of flora dn fauna,4.0,,"I am kind of in love with this place, the sheer variety of plants and flowers exhibited here is awesome. You get to see many of the carnivorous plants and huge variety of orchids.
I like the way they have planned the walk down, giving one mesmerizing view. The coolest part is the way mist created and maintained all throughout this dome.
If I get a chance I'll surely visit the place again."
,,Just Beautiful,5.0,,Excellent display of plants and water features. Definitely worth the entry fee and the time it takes to see it.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A lovely place to visit and the air-conditioning is a reprieve from the hot weather. Great to walk around in and admire the plants, waterfall and dome."
,,Man made wonders,5.0,,"The gardens by the bay can be shortened to be called as ""Man made wonders"" and cloud forest adds to its beauty. Very well planned and maintained, Visit by late evening as the lights makes them more beautiful. Nature is taken cared in a modern way."
,,Incredible Creation,5.0,,"This is just one of the two conservatories that comprise the indoor portion of the Gardens by the Bay. The waterfall is exceptional but so is the way that they present our planet's plight through visual displays, film videos and other teaching aids."
,,Exciting fresh new(ish) attraction to Singapore,5.0,,This attraction was not here when I first visited Singapore and I was intrigued to visit and I was not disappointed. It was quite amazing and magical at the same time would definitely recommend
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,Its just awesome. The waterfall is so romantic. The place is filled with all kind of flowers. Its a photographer's paradise. Must visit
,,Go for it,5.0,,A must visit place in Singapore where it will give you a total new experience. Right from the waterfall in the entrance to the 4 PM fog.
,,"Really cool architecture & beautiful to see (also, it got cold in there!)",5.0,,"We went through the Flower dome and the Cloud Forest and all agreed that the Cloud Forest was far more interesting and impressive.

The temperature drops as soon as you enter, and it actually got quite cold! Most people marvel at the waterfall at the entrance, then start circling around the central structure - all the way up to the top.

There's an elevator that will lift you to the top, and you can choose to walk town to the bottom again while taking in each level. The plants and flora are beautiful and refreshing. There are many, many photo opportunities.

I will say, I'm really happy we went on a Friday (late) afternoon. I expect it gets more crowded at the weekend, and I imagine it may be slightly annoying (as people take tons of photos so you have to wait).

Overall, the Cloud Forest alone was worth the price of both tickets. We really enjoyed it there. If you're sensitive to the cold though, bring a jacket!"
,,Mystic Cloud Forest....,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is a must visit attaction in the marina Bay for all ages plants and flower lovers. 
Its a huge massive garden covering 100 hectares , it housed several rare and unique  plant varieties.

The main part of garden is the Sky Aviary walk way and the cooled Conservatories Flowere Dome and Cloud forest. 
I booked tickets Online for 28SGD. Gardens by the Bay can vee easily reached by alighting the MRT at Bayfront Station and taking exit B 
and then cross the Dragon Lake.

The view is amazing greenish colourfull and well maintained . The Flower doom captivated our eyes in aiconditioned controlled environment Dome with 
rare varieties of plants , flowere , shrubs
cactus, bonsai, and a lot more. After enjoying the beauty of Flower doom i headed to Cloud forest , when i just entered inside i was amzes to see a 
high water fall puring down.. its like entereing into a tropical forest and a huge mountain with misty cloud ..i walked around the conservatory and 
wondered at the species
 of plants that is nurtured and protected and grown in such a cool environment. The top lecve can be reached by the elevator and can ve a stunning 
look at the garden in a birds eye view of the scenic garden . Mist is being produced at regular intervals with timings and we could feel that we are in aterrain mountain area. I could say Gardens by the Bay is really an amazing place to spend a whole day..."
,,Interesting but still unnatural,4.0,,"Well, it does look impressive and walking around, in and on it is fun. But at the end of the day there is something a bit sad about such a fake, indoor place. Go and see some proper nature in Singapore at MacRitchie or Pulau Ubin too."
,,Lovely place to vist to escape the heat,5.0,,"What a fantastic place and the building is amazing with fantastic views, a must when visiting Singapore. The setting and gardens are beautiful strolling round was so peaceful a lovely memory."
,,An indoor oasis,5.0,,"Normally touristy things like this generally aren't worth it - however cloud forest is an exception. It is truly impressive. The range of plants, a real, functional indoor waterfall, the mist spray, multi-levelled boardwalks. Much better than the flower dome. Definitely go see it, not much else like it in the entire world. Great for photos, particularly at dusk when you can start to see the city skyline through the dome also. It's not cheap, but try and get some discount vouchers."
,,Cloud view,5.0,,If you tend to go to gardens by the bay the cloud forest is must watch . As soon as you enter you get to see a water fall and then return is the secret . It's a beautiful place and it includes thrill and adventure too . Among all gardens I found cloud forest the best .
,,Just amazing.,5.0,,"Really stunning. Brilliant architecture features, nice weather while indoors. In the early afternoon the clouds (watering system) goes on. Pretty spectacular. This is quieter than the flowers pavilion and much better. Unless you are a Chinese tourist and you need to take a closeup shot of all the flowers."
,,Inspirational,5.0,,The scale of this green house is amazing and the concept of being in the mountains at different heights is wonderful. We witnessed the maintenance team climbing on ropes to tend the Rick face plants. Unmissable.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Marvellous waterfall and gorgeous foliage. With the mist all around you, you get the feeling that you're actually walking among the clouds!"
,,A spectacular garden,5.0,,"I have been to singapores Cloud forest 3 times now and it just gets better every time. One vist was during a thunder storm, so spectacular, I can't wait till my next vist."
,,Great feeling,5.0,,Cloud forest makes you feel that you are in the middle of forest with trees and water falls around you. Well managed. Worth spending half a day in garden including the cloud forest.
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,I spent a very enjoyable afternoon visiting cloud forest and then later in the evening the super trees. Its a fun activity for a hot afternoon
,,A unique place to visit,4.0,,"Cloud forest is a place created with a unique concept of sky walking kind of thing. Recommended for people of all ages. Completely indoor, so suitable to visit in any climate. Plan for about 2-3 hours for this attraction."
,,Nice place,5.0,,Its amazing place and exciting with all natural trees and water fall and flowers with close place and air-condition.
,,Jaw dropping indoor botanic experience.,5.0,,"This place is amazing. First we were awed by the foliage, and then the thought of what it took to construct this garden under a dome."
,,"Excellent on a hot day, or anytime!",5.0,,"Must do while in Gardens by the bay. Get the combo ticket for both glass houses. The waterfall is amazing, tons of walking in a mist. Feels like a rain forest. Go early in the day"
,,My family loved this (night visit),5.0,,"We visited the Cloud forest at night. Both my hubby and kid loved this. I loved the hanging trail (cloud trail) and secret garden more. There is something for everyone.
Better to start on this activity by 5:30pm so as to cover secret garden by night."
,,Cloud Forest in the gardens,4.0,,If you are visiting the gardens you might wan to consider spending the few dollars to visit the Cloud Forest. Quite Spectacular. Do go early in the morning otherwise it can be rather crowded.
,,"Surprising, even though you know what to expect",5.0,,"This was, by far, my favourite thing about my trip to Singapore (aside from the Grand Prix!) What a stunning idea, realised so beautifully. Prepare to get a bit wet at the bottom of the waterfall!"
,,Beautiful design,4.0,,An amazing indoor greenhouse combining modern architecture and natural botanicals. We arrived towards late afternoon and have enjoyed the beauty of both day time and night time views. There are also some mini expos and education spots about protecting the nature and environment. Recommended for both adults and kids. Just the floor was quite wet and slippery....
,,Amazing,5.0,,"what an amazing display of ALL different species of flowers & plants and the displays were breath taking could have spent hours just wondering and looking. Highly recommend to anyone, get there early and then after there are several restaurants so you can make a night of it"
,,Delightful!,5.0,,"A cleverly designed structure,towering into the sky the cloud forest dome is well worth the visit with many beautiful plants and flowers to enjoy. There are so many delightful surprises at the cloud forest. It is also a great educational centre for young and old teaching about our environment and how to protect it."
,,Nicely done,3.0,,"Nicely done greenhouse. Visit if you never travel to mountains in the region. Nice for tourists that want some pleasant air conditioning. But please visit real mountains instead, they are so much better"
,,A magical place.,5.0,,Wow. This indoor complex has it all. An experience you cant miss when visiting Singapore. Wonderfully laid out and easy walking.
,,Very peaceful and relaxing,4.0,,"From the moment you walk in there is a massive waterfall, it was very peaceful and relaxing I could have stood there all day just listening to the waterfall. As you climb through the levels there is so much to see and you don't know where to look. Once you reach the top trying to take in the whole atmosphere is breath taking."
,,Great way to cool off!,4.0,,We did both the cloud forest and the flower dome and I recommend doing both but we enjoyed the flower dome more. The cloud forest has an enormous waterfall and you travel to the top and walk your way back down. The secret garden at the top is gorgeous!
,,Don't miss if you go to the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"An amazing experience within a giant ""greenhouse"" A waterfall breats you when you enter and sets the very high standards seen."
,,Tranquillity in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"The cloud dome, very good choice for a hot weather and also many photo bug opportunities. Do catch the Misting timing to see the whole place becoming like avatar movie scene. You get to see many different flora here."
,,An architecturally stunning dome houses a tropical rain forest,4.0,,"It's a walk through a rain forest complete with rain falls, clouds and a towering canopy of huge trees and vines. A great visual experience."
,,The chilly feeling of the Cloud Forest just like on the mountain top.,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is cooling and fresh when I had been there. There are many interesting sections inside that bring out the best highlights of the place.
,,Amazing Garden with rainfall,5.0,,"Actually lot of Natural Rainfall and garden in my country, Indonesia.
But when you find it in Singapore, even it's not natural rainfall it's still amazing.
They know how to manage it and know how to market it.
All the flowers there perfectly colouring the garden..
Bring your jacket/sweater if you are not used to stay long in the cold area"
,,Wow.. .,5.0,,"This was one of my favourite attractions, we spent all morning in here. The walkways were very high and even I was a little spooked but it was well worth doing. The waterfalls are amazing and there is even a steamy cloud effect when you climb high into the forest. The plant life and carvings and displays are amongst the best I've seen. If you're a nature lover you'll love this."
,,A Cool Lost World,5.0,,"An outstanding way to enjoy an afternoon in a cool air-conditioned and mysterious rain forest waterfall environment. Avoid the suspended sky walk around the 7th level if you suffer from agoraphobia. Go with loved ones, and take as many photos as you can. Everyone will love the Cloud Forest!"
,,Loved the Cloud Forest,5.0,,Great place to visit. Temperature controlled and nice and cool. Loved it! Come here as part of your visit to the gardens on the bay.
,,Unique,4.0,,A unique place to visit. Quite beautiful and peaceful. Visit is a must when you visit Singapore. Definitely worth it.
,,A must do,5.0,,This place was amazing and totally worth the money. Not only is it cool inside the plants and height that you can climb to is amazing and worth seeing
,,Beautiful Garden!,5.0,,"Amazing views and great plant life, the waterfall is really amazing too! If you can, make sure you're there for misting time as it was such a great site, if you're in the gardens, do not skip this!"
,,Man made greenery,4.0,,"Cloud forest and flower dome together comes at a price of S$28, which is on the higher side.
For some one used to seeing a lot of greenery there may not be a great excitement seeing the cloud forest. However the overall feel is good. May be a visit at misting time gives a better feel"
,,Not much to cover,3.0,,Area was rather little to cover and it was done in less than 30 min.. Not worth the $$$ unless u really got no where to go.. lol
,,a walk in the clouds,3.0,,the walk among floors are interesting but not for faint hearted! check out misting time and visit accordingly for a good experience.
,,Large man made greenery,4.0,,"A great feat of architecture and very interesting to look at and climb down from. For me personally, it was not worth the ticket price. Considering this is a tiny island with few natural attractions, this is a decent place to go if one has time to kill."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Everything from the waterfall at the entrance, to the overhead walkways that wind through the exotic plant life, makes for an incredible adventure. The whole dome has a very 'Jurassic Park'-like vibe to it, very cool.

Didn't visit the flower dome, but we seriously felt there was no need to-- You could get lost in here for ages!"
,,Great few hours,5.0,,"There are two domes styled like buildings from the movie Avatar. Tropical rainforest in one and more temperate regions in the other. it was very well done and definitely worth a visit. 86 SGD for us four including two teenagers. You can take the elevator to the top canopy level and walk down. Additionally there are beautiful grounds and an elevated walkway (lift up but walk down). As a family we all enjoyed it and much better than most tourist type activities you get in Singapore, it must have been very expensive to construct but it's also high quality."
,,wonderfully constructed and maintained,4.0,,"wonderfully constructed with beautiful plants and flower everywhere. The artificial waterfalls at the entrance is fine (you could make out that its not natural and that's a turn off for me). Place is cool and refreshing, carry a thin sweater if needed."
,,Very lovely and tropical,5.0,,"The cloud forest was very tropic and felt almost like the jungle! I loved it and would recommend it very much! The sky walks (lost world) are super cool and a good walk. I would say go to this conservatory not the flower dome, as it's very set up and the plants are really common and a bit boring. When leaving the sky walk (lost world), take your time to stop and watch the infomercials about global warming and the +5 celsius short documentary. It's worth the time and nicely done!"
,,AMAZING,5.0,,An amazing place to visit. Best to start at the top and work your way down through the different gardens within the cloud forest. A cool place out of the suns heat.
,,What a lovely view,4.0,,The Singapore flyer was great we had a wonderful time such a fantastic view from the top you can see all over Singapore
,,Highy enjoyable and educational,5.0,,"My 7 year old loved reading the posters on the wall and learning abot the plants and animals of the forest.

The cool environment inside was also a perfect reapite from the heat outside. The waterfalls at the entrance is very impressive. Inside is serves an opportunity for learning together with your children."
,,quite fantastic!,4.0,,a really beautiful place to visit. best thing is that its indoors so can be appreciated even if its too hot outside. a magnificent achievement!
,,Nice place!,5.0,,Excellent place. Very beautiful and serene. You could go there any time of the year. :) I will strongly recommend to make at least one trip to this place.
,,Nice for an hour,5.0,,great for photos as you walk up then down this amazing forest structure. Excellent opportunity for photos off the flowers and friends and family
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Even if you are not into plants and flowers, this conservatory must be seen to be believed. It is stunning! From the ground level you can view the towering waterfall and the huge structure that scaffolds the plants. Walking a little further you will be entranced by the wooden sculpture/statues of mythical beasts, then it's up, up, up, to the top of the structure too begin a magical journey coming down again with endless plants - orchids and many others - that cover the tower. While at the top the view through the windows is awesome - from the Marina Bay Sands, to the River and so many other views. Under the structure there is a very pretty area with a smaller waterfall and ""lake"" with photo opportunities at every turn. May be younger children would not be impressed but us ""oldies"" can't get enough. Allow at least 1-2 hours to thoroughly see it all and if you like taking photos be prepared for longer! Can't wait to go back and see the changes that occur all the time!"
,,Nice area to cool off after a long walk around the gardens,3.0,,"Nice place but not as good as I expected it to be. The vertical gardens are marvelous, nice architecture covered in plants. The waterfall at the entrance is beautiful. Then you will climb up to the top and come down while watching the rest of it.
I will only give it an average rating as there is no much variety and that is a shame."
,,Beautiful and tranquil placebo visit,4.0,,I really loved this place. going up in the cloud forrest was constantly a joy as there were new things around each bend. A great place on a hot day!!
,,The Falls,3.0,,The main attraction is The Falls - should be climbs.There are elevators too ....but a climb is better
,,WOW!,5.0,,If in Singapore then you must go there! Just delightfully beautiful and intriguing. Well worth the trip and everyone will enjoy. Took a 14 year old who was reluctant before but definitely loved it.
,,Average place,3.0,,"Nice place with cool temperatures yet nothing much you can see in there , waterfall area is cooling as well as the top touring the place can be fast as there isnt much to see. Interesting to see this place in a hot city."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was my favorite part of Gardens By The Bay. The plants and foliage were beautiful, along with a variety of statues and fun objects tucked between the plants. Walking on the skyways was rather ""interesting"" - not something you do if you're afraid of heights."
,,Cooling! One of a Kind,5.0,,"Located within Gardens by the Bay, you will be a paid ticket to enter this dome which is taller than its sister flower dome. It is a good place to hide away from the hit as its ""air-conditioned"" within the dome."
,,Not what you expect,3.0,,"In some ways it is good, it's an amazing piece of a architecture and the gardens are good to look at but it just doesn't live up to it's reputation. The botanic gardens are a better option for gardens."
,,Unique and amazing,4.0,,You enter into a different world. The spray from waterfall and the cool green surroundings after the hot weather from outside changes your mood immediately. It is unique and worth visiting.
,,"Impressive construction, interesting displays",4.0,,Go all the way to the top! Beautiful plants and flowers abbound all the way. Try to be there when the misting happens. It's every 2 hours and really adds to the atmosphere.
,,wow,5.0,,"I'm amazed by the modern technology, turning those impossibles to be possible. The cloud forest is like a dream world. 35 meters high, a size of a foodball field. So fantasy and dreamy, you should really visit it."
,,An interesting place,5.0,,"My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands Hotel, so this place was merely a short walk from the hotel. It was very cool and refreshing inside the Dome, which gave us a reprieve from the heat outside. We walked across the entire ""forest""."
,,Amazing,5.0,,What a beautiful place with amazing gardens and fabulous sculptures. Was also lovely and cool inside away from the Singapore humidity. We were also there when the mist went off inside which gave it a true rainforest feeling. Just lovely
,,Cloud Forest - awesome,5.0,,"One of my favourite places - a must see when in Singapore. The waterfall is amazing. This dome is temperature controlled in keeping with an actual cloud forest layer so is much cooler than outside. Makes a great respite from the hot and humid weather...
Gorgeous plants and educational too. What more could you want"
,,Simply Gorgeous! Worth the Cost!,5.0,,A really special experience worth every cent! Visited with a family including 2 teenage kids. Everyone loved it! The waterfall is spectacular!
,,Strange and somehow fake.,1.0,,Save your money - there are lots of fabulous things to see and do in SG - this contrivance is not one of them.
,,Very enjoyable visit,5.0,,Impressive indoor attraction - a nice escape from the heat! We went early evening and it was not too busy - I think it would be less enjoyable if it was very busy as it is at the weekend.
,,Nothing else compares,5.0,,"This attraction should be compulsory , its so clever the way its been done.
We visited when they had cherry blossoms .
I have never seen anything like it
There are golf buggies to take you there from the MRT Station
Just go , its landscaping at its very best in the world
Its the 8th wonder of the world"
,,Awe Inspiring,5.0,,"At first I thought that the ticket price was a little expensive, but after seeing the inside of the dome I was amazed. It is an experience unlike any other - well worth the trip and the price."
,,Interesting Cloud Forest,5.0,,You will be greeted by the water fall as you enter the Cloud Forest. Along the way you can see greenery and flowers on both side of the walkway. Look carefully and you can find pitcher plant an insect eating plants! At one corner there are flowers and inserts made from Lego. You can find the biggest flower Rafflesia too. You could take the lift up to have a closer look of the plants at the sky walkway.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Cloud forest is something unique to see. Right when you walk in you can feel the cold breeze and a little spray of water from the falls. We took pictures right away! It was a great way to take a break from the humidity of Singapore. The inside is beautiful so make sure to take lots and lots of photos (which we did! ^_^) The building itself is something I've never seen before. It was fun going up and walking on the pathways above, just make sure not to look down because it is a little frightening :D Overall, it was something beautiful to see and experience!"
,,Well worth the ticket price,4.0,,"A lovely visit, cool, calm and serene and with a real sense of being somewhere special. The exhibition on climate change was interesting too linking the garden back to the need for carbon capture and sustainability."
,,bring a jacket! it's cold,4.0,,"it is at least 3 degree cooler than outside! the minute you goes in, you can feel it! there are many types of orchards along the walks . do go in again in the evenings as lights will be on and you can see sunset thru the windows"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Just amazing how they have created this. It is totally worth the small amount of money to go into these two domes.
,,well worth the visit,5.0,,an iconic must tick if in the city.good value for money.you can get there on the mrt train.your entry allows access to both domes.a good experience and educational for children as well.
,,So beautiful and just really interesting.,5.0,,It is absolutely incredible and the photos really do not do it justice. The probably 5 story indoor waterfall is just breath taking. It had lots other that just the waterfall though. You take an elevator to the top of the waterfall and walk threw the different levels of the forest there is also a a crystal room that's incredible. They also have a video room that talks about the effects of global warming and the possible future our world could face. Really cool learning experience and just interesting and beautiful place.
,,Lovely and cool to retreat from the heat,4.0,,I loved the coolness in the dome and it was fun walking up higher and higher onto the top walkways to look around. Much better to be outside it looking at the greenery than to be inside looking at concrete and air conditioning pipes!
,,Never fails to impress,5.0,,"My third time visiting the Cloud Dome and each time I'm awestruck by the sheer cleverness of the construction and layout.

If possible try to time your visit so that you're there for the 'misting'. We were there for the 12 noon one and it adds a somewhat mystical feeling to the place.

Also, try to arrive as close to opening time as possible to beat the crowds. We noticed that as the day progressed the volume of people increased markedly. The Dome is also popular with school groups so you need to have some patience when navigating around the little ones.

Remember also that holders of a Singapore Airlines Boarding Pass get 10% off the price of admission.

Don't miss this unique attraction!"
,,Wow wow and wow,5.0,,"The building structure amazes me, i am civil engineer and build tall buildings. Nice waterfall, good place to take date on hot summer day or rainy day, perfect for evening visit.
Tons of plants and flowers to take pics. Restrooms, store and other facility. expensive ticket to get in."
,,Man made mountain with a vegetation and water-fall to boot,5.0,,"The man-made mountain is covered with vegetarians and flowers from rain forest. The whole dome is air conditioned. The experience of walking on the bridges around the mountain is just awesome. Wall-fall with its mist gives you feel of a real rain forest. Flowers, greenery, water-fall, mist and elevation, all adds to a natural flavor.
Traveled by MRT, need to walk 500-700 m before reaching the domes (paid shuttle is available)."
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"Situated in the middle of the beautiful (and free to explore) 'Gardens by the Bay', this dome is not something we would have paid to go and explore, however it was included in a pass we had purchased. So glad it was. Such beautiful plants and waterfall inside and a fountain (not literally) of learning to be had. My highlight was the room of stats and graphs about population and global warming, followed by a video extrapolating what may happen to the environment over the next century. Very well done, with a brilliant use of graphs (that's right, I like graphs, don't judge me). Very much worth a visit."
,,Highlight of Gardens by the bay,4.0,,"This is the best part (for me) about Gardens by the bay. Just a lot of amusing things that keep you entertained. To queue to get the tickets can get pretty long, so you can buy it online on your phone to (if you have internet) and show it to them."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,This indoor forest is amazing. The waterfall is by far the most popular part to this. The assortment of orchids and plants is brilliant. Great place to escape the heat!
,,Wow,5.0,,This huge dome takes to away to another world. Beautiful planting. Interesting to navigate with walkways and escalators. It truly is a beautiful thing to see
,,Make sure you are wearing something Warm!,3.0,,"It is replica of what real cloud forests are like.They have some 3 to 4 floors inhibiting trees, plants, rocks residing in such weathers. The moment you enter you can see a huge waterfall in front of you. And it is also a favorite photo spot. You have to walk along the bridge. IMO they could have made it more green from even inside to give you that feel of a forest. You can hear the waterfall loudly but the inside view is much like a museum and not a forest, just that it is chilling inside. They also start mist every 2 hours, like 2:00 PM then 4:00 PM when you can see the mist coming out from several spots/pipes. Again it could have been more cloudy over here.

The 5 Degree show is quite informative and good for kids. That I must say is a good initiative!"
,,Not as expected!,3.0,,Entering the cloud Forrest was disappointing specially for my six years old son 'he was actually looking forward to see some clouds' the set up is nice but it's not as big as the flower done nor it has as much variety of plants. There was was the lost world path but the kids wweren't interested in going going up.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Its a rainy forest in a closed controlled environment, so beautiful to educate the kids on forests and botanical life. The waterfall is identical to a natural one. We were really amazed."
,,avatar movie in life,5.0,,very interesting rain forest atmosphere build by men. several storeys of plants from rainforsts liveing in theri natural environment
,,part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,so much to see and so much to do. Walked until my legs were so sore. But the flowers and the indoors water falls were all worth it.
,,Eh..,3.0,,"This place is ok, but it is not high on my list. It presents a chance to walk through several different biological ecosystems, all contained under a dome. It costs a bit to get in and the content is rather limited. About the best thing is that it is air conditioned. Thus it is not as hot as the Botanical Gardens (which are a lot better value and far more engaging)."
,,Beautiful and well-curated,4.0,,This is one of the two domes at the Gardens by the Bay. It's really pretty at the top level. Nearing sunset is the best time. Get to the top level nearing sunset :)
,,A magnificent design,4.0,,"We enjoyed spending a few hours at the cloud forest. It is a very special place and really does the best at showing us why Singapore is great - the ability to do something different and special such as putting a cloud forest in a glass enclosure in the middle of the tropics.

We made the mistake of going during the easter weekend so the crowds were enormous and i think it would be best to go during the week if possible to avoid the feeling of being herded around."
,,Garden visit,5.0,,"Visited on 29/03/2016, great place and a good place to cool off after you have looked around the gardens outside."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,A must see if you go to the Gardens by the Bay. This is one of the 2 indoor gardens (the other is the Flower Dome).
,,Great break from the heat!,4.0,,This is a nice place to visit if you are traveling with kids. Inside is quite cold so you might want to bring a light jacket with you. You can take some nice pictures inside and there is a skywalk inside with a see trough floor!
,,A must visit thing,5.0,,I was amazed by the way they have designed this doom. Nice watery sound cool breeze and multi level of observation bridge makes it a wonderful visiting place .
,,Lots of plants,5.0,,"There so much to see, make sure your camera battery is charged and you have space to take photos. Spend an hour or two just looking at everything."
,,Good,4.0,,This is a very good place to go.The place is very well thought out and built.A good place for family outings.Its cool inside hot outside.
,,Magical,5.0,,We weren't initially going to go here but on a spur of a moment decided to and we are so glad we did! It is so beautiful and amazing I have never seen anything like it. The contrast between man made and natural is magical. GO!
,,Great on a hot day,5.0,,"The Cloud Dome was very chilly and you got wet as you walked in, great because it was so hot outside! The waterfall is brilliant and walking around viewing the sculptures was amazing. We enjoyed the walk and there weren't very many people in there so we had the place nearly to ourselves."
,,I was dubious but should not have been,5.0,,"Walking round giant greenhouses isn't really something I would chose to do but this was fab. Well presented and colourful, the thought and detail put into this attraction pays off.
Walk round outside first and when you can't cope with the heat any more come into to cloud forest to cool down and relax. Lots to see and enjoy."
,,Good Architecture Design,5.0,,You will be amazed by the waterfall after enter the gate. It's located inside Garden by the Bay area. Worth to visit to chill especially after you walk around outdoor garden area in the afternoon.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Like lots of Singapore attractions this was done to PERFECTION.... Absolutely wonderful place to spend a couple of hours wandering and looking.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Great place to visit close to the marina bay. Nice artificial water fall along with great collection of exotic plants. Minimum 3 hrs required fr completion. Recommended for tourists visiting Singapore.
,,Stroll Through a Sublime Tropical Jungle,5.0,,"What a delightful oasis in the midst of Singapore! A cool, misty and magical stroll through the various levels, with flowers, waterfalls and exhibits of real interest. Not to mention spectacular views through the dome of the gardens and downtown Singapore. The subtropical dome has desert scapes, spectacular floral displays and areas representing different locales around the world. This is an opportunity not to be missed when visiting Singapore."
,,Outstanding.,5.0,,"Having been to the Eden project in Cornwall,the Cloud Forest leaves it standing.Go to the top and make your way down,brilliant"
,,Walk in the clouds,4.0,,A good break from the concrete jungle. Love the refreshing vibe of the place. My parents loved it. The waterfall is a good photo op place. The plants are regularly maintained and taken care of. Good place for kids and family outings.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"What a great place to explore and take photos! We spent a couple of hours wandering around. Arrived just before midday, not that busy, nice and cool. The waterfall was wonderful!"
,,No Cloud No Forest,1.0,,"The whole place is man made and artificial, I didn't like it at all but children and other people liked it somewaht"
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"A welcome relief from the heat and a stunning place of beauty. The entrance is a waterfall and a wall of green and flowers. The elevators take you to the top (last section is stairs but disabled access is available). From the top down it is an easy, laid back saunter through, around and above lush greenery. Simply stunning."
,,Too busy,4.0,,"This is a very nice attraction and I recommend visiting it. However, there is a long queue at the entrance and it coul be too busy inside to take photos and walk around."
,,Real forest,5.0,,This is the most relaxing place in Singapore. A forest that makes you feel like walking in a heaven.
,,worth visiting in SG! literally cool with spectacular view!,4.0,,"it's one of the two domes in Gardens by the Bay area that you have to buy the ticket for before entering (cheaper when you buy in combo with the tix for flower dome) It's got artificial waterfall, exhibit of lush rainforest plants, cool air, walking+viewing area across the top level. worth visiting after all..especially if you want a short escape from the busy city..spend some time to cool down and enjoy the lush greenery and feel the fresh mist from the waterfalls."
,,A Mini Tropical Rainforest!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest in Singaopre's Gardens by the Bay is absolutely awe-inspiring! You walk straight in to see a 35m high mountain with a waterfall plunging from it's peak; just like what you'd expect to see in a tropical rainforest, except maybe a bit cooler (both in terms of temperature and because it's inside a building!).

The tree-top walk that wraps around the mountain give wonderful views of the plants below and of the scenery outside the building - such a wonderful addition, but perhaps not recommended for those with vertigo ;)"
,,Peaceful,5.0,,You can actually imagine that your up in the clouds. It was night time when we visited and probably this hid any imperfections. Well worth the visit. Cost $16
,,One of a kind highland forest,4.0,,"The dome is cooled and misting occurs every 2hrs to simulate highland rainforests. One can see various types of flowers, trees and ferns. Visiting it during the day and get the stamp when you exit so that you can check it out again at night when the lights are on to get the best out of your ticket. Be sure to buy the combined ticket which allows you to visit both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome."
,,Unexpected !,5.0,,Climb the forest to discover a different world when you start your descend to the lower floor Is really nice to see and walk around and in this forest Good for small kids like mine also
,,Impressive but feels a a bit Disney...,4.0,,"Impressive green house in the Gardens by the Bay. Good to visit if you do the Gardens anyway. Apart from that: interesting to see, a little bit of rather children focused a Disney feeling to it."
,,Favourite place in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This place is absolutely spectacular. The giant waterfall is just beautiful and there are different levels that you can view it from. As well as seeing the inside of the dome from cloud level, you also get a fantastic view of the city outside. Loads of little surprises of sculptures and art among the plants. Informative and important displays on climate change. A lot of tourists but not as ridiculously packed as the flower garden dome. Also, climate controlled, a lovely escape from the hot weather outside!"
,,Just Okay,3.0,,It's a waterfall over a giant green dome. But if you're at the Garden Dome you might as well walk over to see this.
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,We visited the cloud forest in the evening and were just in awe from when we first entered when we saw this amazingly large waterfall. Was special to have the mist on (just be sure to keep your camera dry if its not waterproof) as we descended from the top and the Lego exhibit of 'flowers' was great to see also.
,,this is a must see,5.0,,"gorgeous , but if frightened by heights the walk will scare you , i was frightened but im glad i did it"
,,Climb to the summit,5.0,,An amazing conservatory and well worth the visit and ticket price. Climb to the top and work your way down the mountain. Spent well over an hour inside.
,,superb place to visit,5.0,,"new experience, a never felt before experience, get set to be soaked a bot and experience v chilly temperatures inside even if its 30 degrees outside, so well maintaines , its a technological genius and place of fame and pride for singapore"
,,Good Experience,5.0,,It has been nicely made. Although its artificial but it has been made to amuse the visitors. The walk from the top to the bottom with the mist is a good experience along with the tallest indoor water fall. Fantastic idea.
,,nice garden,4.0,,it is located just beside the Gardens by bay. nice big collection of tree and herbs. has a nice big artificial water fall in the entrance. u may spend some good time here if u r a nature lover.
,,Feeling fresh,5.0,,"Once when we entered the Cloud Forest in the sunny afternoon, we felt cool and fresh. Firstly, we saw the waterfall running from the highest point. It's the first photo spot. The visitors should take lift to the top and then walk on the well-designed walkway down to the ground level. As compared with the Flower Dome, it is less congested with the tours."
,,Essential Visit,5.0,,"Fantastic, despite my lack of head for heights I braved this & was fully rewarded with an amazing experience. Thank you to all the staff & creators of this wonderful destination"
,,Great Value,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest I thought was the best of the two.
The temperature in both are meant to be the same 25deg but with the large waterfall and the fine mist in the air I am sure this one felt cooler.
There is elevators and escalators to take you to the top of the falls and down again or once you are at the top you can walk down on the boardwalk for a top of the forest look.
Amazing variety of plants and the prettiest flowers.
We also enjoyed looking at all of the carvings placed through out the gardens.
Both are really worth a look but if time is short than this is the one to do."
,,Went to see the Cherry Blossoms,5.0,,I have seen the cherry blossoms in bloom in Japan so wasn't expecting this display to impress me as much. I have to say it is fantastic. The old saying 'ask a local' seems true here because the amount of Japanese at the display taking photos tells me how realistic it is. There are also lots of cactus on display in the Cloud Forest as well. The whole experience of the Gardens by the Bay is great. The outer gardens are free to wander through but to enter the 3 domes there is a surcharge.
,,Wonderful Gardern under the roof,5.0,,"No words to say, such a beauty and diversity of the plants . Interesting part is that the entire garden is under a roof and mind blowing."
,,Man made heaven,5.0,,this is one of the places that one need to see to believe. It makes you understand how man can create things so close to nature with all the expertise.
,,It's one of a kind,5.0,,"Beautiful and amazing. you see all kind of flowers and plants here, I loved the Japanese cherry blossoms."
,,Amazing for nature lovers!,4.0,,Basically plants that grows on high lands. Can get pretty cold and has amazing waterfalls. Might be a problem for people who are afraid of heights as you need to climb the stairs and bridge-like pathway that can be really slippery because it gets wet. Choose your footwear properly when going here. We opt to remove our shoes so we can walk properly. It's very informative though.
,,Cool Waterfall,5.0,,"There is a large waterfall inside this dome which keeps the entire area cool, but it may also be due to the air conditioning .

It contains lots of exotic plants from Orchids, to Carnivorous plants. I especially love the Rafflesia flower. It's big and stinky.

There are also lots of Pitcher Plants and Cobra Lilies.
I would recommend this over the Flower Garden since I find the Flower Garden to be a little bit boring compared to this.

If you just want to get inside one of the gardens, you have to bring a friend who lives in Singapore (Citizen, Permanent Resident, Holders of Employment Pass). If you are a Tourist, you have no choice but to buy the more expensive option (which covers both the Flower Garden AND The Cloud Forest)"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,I was surprised how much i enjoyed wandering up and throughout this man made cloud forest. Stunning.
,,Fantastic Experience,5.0,,This is truly a fabulous place and unlike any other indoor garden I have ever been to; would recommend this highly if you have an appreciation for the natural world.
,,A M A Z I N G,5.0,,Such a beautiful experience. The moment you walk in the attraction it is a delight. Great attraction to see if you want a break from the heat as it is air conditioned. You won't even blink your eyes here as there is so much to see you won't have a chance to blink. Breathtaking and educational.
,,it cost to see inside,3.0,,I think the entry fee is a bit expensive. just to see the man made forest and waterfall. some plants and trees just hanged on the wall by the gardeners. the creations look very nice. but I prefer to be in the real forest.
,,Wow stunnig,5.0,,"This is a must experience,lots to see and a lovely easy walk around so may trees and plants ,waterfall great and easy to walk around. A place to relax on a hot day ,found it very peaceful and relaxing."
,,This place was something else!,5.0,,"This place was seeing is believing ....wow! The plants, water fall, statues, carvings! We climbed to the top and walked slowly down , and what a view!"
,,An excellent view from the top - not to miss the misting show,4.0,,The Cloud forest as one of the two conservatories is worth a visit and it has a misting show which takes place at particular times everyday. Avoid public holidays / weekends - to avoid the crowd.
,,amazing,5.0,,"lovely worth the visit. excellent for families, really cold, take some jumper with you. dont forget your camera!"
,,Wow magickal,5.0,,"Fully air conditioned, cold in fact and as the displays are seasonal it is likely to be different for each visit. We went for the Cherry Blossom. Spectacular"
,,Land of flowers and so colorful,5.0,,"I had no expectation until I walked inside and see the high waterfall and all green plantations. The temperature is very cool inside and it's feel so comfortable to walk around this place. The walkway around the waterfall is quite smart, I enjoy taking many photos with many different platforms and locations."
,,amazing,5.0,,"Visited Cloud Forest with my wife & we were blown away by the beautiful array of scenery, truly breathtaking & a sight to be seen by all visiting Singapore.
The man made waterfall is sensational, unable to describe until you've seen for yourself. Temperature inside the dome is extremely pleasant after battling the Singapore heat & internal dome mist / waterfall water spray is lovely to walk through. Excellent overhanging walkways allow you to venture to the peak of the dome & don't forget your camera for some picturesque shots. Highly recommend & allow 2-3hrs to enjoy this attraction.."
,,Make sure you visit during misting times,4.0,,"Misting of the cloud forest takes place at certain times (in regular intervals) and span for around 10 mins. So if you need to see cloud like formations, or take a photo while within the mist; plan your visit. I was at the top when they started misting at 4pm."
,,Best dome ever!,5.0,,"Amazing. for hot days a place to relax, enjoy mother nature. love the birds view. Friendly guides. If it is hot outside, go in and relax, enjoy an learn. Don't miss the movie about +5 degress on earth."
,,Wow,5.0,,"This is a marvel ,the waterfall is beautiful.the walkway around the mountain is construct ed amazingly.huge crowd puller hence you will be lucky to get a chance to click photo without having anyone at the background."
,,Beautiful high in the sky,4.0,,"Quite a site to see as it's an indoor garden, with a waterfall and great views from above. I was in and out of this place in 30 minutes as it was similar to the Flower Dome. Nice photo opportunities by the waterfall and high above. I suggest visiting this in the evening when there are less visitors and you'll be able to enjoy at your own pace without the crowds."
,,Nice Area,4.0,,"it was my second time in there this time but still Very impressive attraction to visit and If you are in Singapore, do not miss this"
,,Great,5.0,,"Worth the visit, easy to get to and not expensive. The gardens are free, you just pay to get into the domes. It's like the Eden project in Cornwall"
,,"Beautiful, just beautiful",4.0,,Wonderful experience walking above the clouds on a very hot day with mist floating in the breeze amongst the beautiful plants. A not to be missed experience!
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,A must see at the Gardens. It's like visiting a very tiny Niagara Falls. You can go up a lift to the top to see the waterfall plus view from below. The cloud forest is very refreshing and beautiful.
,,Imoressive development,5.0,,The two indoor 'glasshouses' (although this term scarcely does them justice) are very impressive developments. The variety of plant life and the organisation of these is impeccable. Looking forward to revisiting on our next trip to Singapore.
,,Breathtaking ... and restoring,5.0,,"Very impressive attraction to visit. Catch the lift to the top and meander down through displays of orchids, bromeliads, carnivorous plants, ferns, waterfalls, mists ... such a relief from the heat outside. Could easily lose yourself here all day and have a great time."
,,A must visit,4.0,,Entertaining and have fun for all age group. Take sufficient available time so that you do not regret because of paucity of time.
,,Amazing place!!,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit. A must when do when in Singapore. Worth the entrance fee. We did it in the afternoon and went back again after watching the symphony of lights at the supertree grove. We found the cloud forest even more spectacular at night as there were only half a dozen people there and the mist made it eerie but so cool. Just ask for a stamp on your first visit when you exit and you can come back again in the evening.
,,Worth Visting,5.0,,Do not miss this. It is a plant conservatoire but a spectacular view in itself. Flower Done and Cloud Forest combined ticket is 28 SGD and it is worth Visting.
,,Great highlight,5.0,,"A walk thru the clouds and amazing gardens, orchids and other plants at their best - tip wear non-slip shoes"
,,Outstanding exhibit!,5.0,,"This enclosed environment captures much of the feeling of the Coasta Rican cloud forest, or El Cielo in Mexico, and adds an instructive commentary so you understand what you've seen."
,,Must see,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, do not miss this. It is a plant conservatoire but a spectacular view in itself. I suggest you to pre-book tickets online because there is always a long line to the ticket counters. Be mindful that the temperature inside is much colder than the outside. You should bring a light coat if you are easily cold."
,,A great way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,Really is to use in order to get around Singapore. The various Coloured lines makes it easy to use and there are Assistants to help you. The cost of travelling is well worth it.
,,If you like orchids and a cool place,3.0,,"Second choice after Flower Dome, on a hot afternoon, to cool down and see mainly orchids, The crystals mountain cave were not well displayed and so was disappointing."
,,Stunning architecture,5.0,,A highlight of our trip to Singapore was a visit to this attracting and it's neighbour. Stunning architecture counterbalanced by a warm and vivid natural ecosystem. A great place to escape the Singaporean heat.
,,too cold and wet for my liking,3.0,,"i went on a rainy day, perhaps it made the temperature within the dome feel colder than it should be. and light winds and splashes from the huge waterfall didn't quite help. the splashes also made the floor wet so if you're visiting, wear shoes with good grip to prevent slips.

visitors may choose to walk along the waterfall but it is not recommended for people who are afraid of heights. an alternative would be to take elevators to the other levels to look through the other exhibits instead."
,,Cloud Forest @ Gardens By the Bay,4.0,,"it's an unique experience - come and see, feel and smell for yourself - within a special setting - You will only know what it's like WHEN you begin your adventure into Cloud Forest!

Enjoy your visit and let it be a memorable one for you when you visit Singapore!"
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Although we live in Singapore, we have a constant stream of visitors passing through who wish to see the sights of the country. Gardens by the Bay is always on our list of spots to take them. The cloud forest is a marvellous place to spend an hour exploring a simulated forest environment. It takes the visitor through each of the levels within a forest from the treetops to the base experiencing what it would be like in a real environment.
It's also cool which is a good respite from the Singapore weather.
One point i would make is that best to avoid the peak times so you can take your time exploring. My experience is that the morning is best. I would avoid saturday and sunday afternoons as it gets very busy not just in the cloud forest but the ticket lines can be quite long. Buy a ticket for both domes and enjoy both over a couple of hours."
,,Very good Experience!,4.0,,"One of the most interesting places in Singapore. Of course, it's ""artificial"" rain forest located in the air-conditioned glasshouse however it really interesting place. You can enjoy spectacular waterfall, many plants and flowers, nice place. The best part is on the top, great..

Visiting this place can be refreshing during hot tropical day and I recommend to visit this place with Flower dome together located nearby."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Totally enjoyed ourselves, very well done. Loves the waterfall, at least it is air conditioned. Highly recommended"
,,spectacular!,5.0,,This is my favourite part from the whole garden complex - very interesting multi-storey design which takes you on the journey and many different plants and exotoc flowers can be seen. loved it!
,,"Cool place to visit, informative...",4.0,,"If you are able to time your visit, you will get to experience the midst which simulates the high altitude of a forest. It is a pleasant walk because its cool, and spacious for most part."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Both my wife and I visited the Cloud Forest in February, 2016. It is breathtakingly beautiful, with cascading waterfalls, exotic plants and stunning vistas. It is only one of the many delights of a visit to Gardens by the Bay."
,,Best attraction in the Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"The cloud forest is one of the best attraction in gardens by the bay. The place is fully air conditioned and the temperature is considerably low to the out side. Don't forget to take a jacket or a shawl to cover you self.
Well maintained forest and if you are lucky you will be able to see the water sprinkling that they do time to time. It makes the whole area covered with a small mist.
Totally worth for the tickets we bought.
Most importantly the water fall at the entrance is one huge man made creation."
,,"Amazing, but avoid if you're afraid of heights :-)",5.0,,"This is a beautiful place to explore. Take the elevator up and slowly walk down and because it's cool, it's a nice change from the Singapore heat."
,,Sky Walk,5.0,,Enjoy a raised Cloud walk through tropical plants. an unusual experience if time allows. The Marina Garden is so large it is difficult to see and do everything.
,,Air-conditioned forest,4.0,,One of the best attraction in Singapore. After a tiring day a walk in the forest will take your pains away.
,,Amazing suspended walkways and views of the Gardens,5.0,,"Great venue and showcase for the rain forest. A few more years will help ""fill-in"" the vegetation so it feels more like a rain forest. Be careful of your cameras as there is floating water in the air everywhere due to the waterfalls and misters."
,,Great Experience!!!!,5.0,,It was a great experience amazing place and relaxing. The waterfall is spectacular as are the views from the top! A must to visit this wonderful place.
,,One of the best in SG,4.0,,This structure will have you stand there and look at its wonder. The view from the outside of the falls is just breath taking. a must do
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,"Green vibe, posetive energy, fresh air, green architecture. You can imagine how much important to prevent earth from global warming"
,,Awesome visit,4.0,,Worth a visit for every tourist and have a peaceful and serene walk across the Cloud forest without rushing
,,Tropical rain forest,5.0,,Great chance to experience tropical rain forests! To feel the drops of the rain at the bottom of the fall.. is fabulous!!
,,Excellent,3.0,,This inside Gardens by the Bay. Must see if you like plants and be prepared to wait in long queues. We go up by lift and come down walking through the plants.
,,Fabulous domed garden in Singapore,5.0,,"A great way to spend a few hours - located in the Gardens by the Bay it really is a must - beautiful plants within a temperature controlled dome with information about, global warming, rock crystals and the climate itself.

Take some time to enjoy the experience"
,,Mist,4.0,,"When you enter the place its cold, carry a jacket if needed. Its something like rainy season in Himalaya."
,,Innovative and Amazing,5.0,,"I was there with my friend, and amazed to see the Construction, design, Waterfall, Flowers, Trees, etc. Must see place in Singapore. Had a nice experience at Cloud Forest"
,,"Superb indoor forest experience, with waterfalls",5.0,,"This indoor forest is a real surprise. The first is the atmosphere inside is a lot cooler than outside, which is pleasant in the hot Singaporean climate.
You make your way up through the forest to the top, and descend through the forest level by level - there are elevators for those with limited mobility.
If your visiting the cloud forest and flower gardens, do visit the gardens first - they seem somewhat of an anticlimax after the cloud forest (which is a shame), so avoid disappointment and do them first."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Great architecture and impressed by the way they construct the plant wall. Both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are good but personally I prefer Cloud Forest. If you scared of wet & chill, you are advised to bring a shawl or jacket as do expect mist & moist when you walking around."
,,Good place to chill,3.0,,"The exhibits are not particularly impressive to us after being to real canopy walk, Niagara Falls & other caves. But the cool conservatory is a good place to go if the weather is too hot or when it rains."
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,"A great engineering structure, impressive plantings and if you want to avoid the heat, just hide our here!"
,,One of its kind!,5.0,,Between the two domes at Gardens by the bay I prefer the Cloud Forest.. It is one of its kind and love the way it is constructed.. Best to visit in the evening to be able to catch the lighting show at super trees (outside the dome)
,,nice & different,4.0,,You must visit this place since they are working a lot on how to make the society to think about global warming.
,,Hosting guests from Taiwan,5.0,,Great friends from Taiwan visiting Singapore after a very long break gives us the opportunity also to visit together. We were very impressed with Cloud Forest and I personally would pay a repeat visit for a more thorough appreciation including those data screens.
,,Not Worth the Money,3.0,,"The first impression after entering is nice and you can take some good pictures of the dream-like cloud forest. But the sky bridge walk around the structure was rather boring and un-impressive. Overall, not really worth the money."
,,Brilliant flowers and plants,5.0,,"Spend the day seeing some of the most amazing plants, especially the Australian natives like me ! Food and drink is always close by. East to bet to with handy shuttle at the gate"
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,Cool and clever- so many different things to look at- everytime you turned your head you saw something different. Gorgeous flowers and geological features as well as informative noticeboards
,,good to see!,4.0,,"Worth while to go there, preferred times in the evening. Plan to be there 45-60 minutes. Will be a good tour through nature."
,,I hate mossy places. So you should go if you like mossy places.,3.0,,"Ugh, moist moss everywhere is the main reason why I avoid cloud forest even though I'm a member of the gardens, and I have free unlimited access to its entirety. But pretty cool if you dig into that type of wet nature. Not for me!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Impressive construction within the Garden by the Bay with an overwhelming multitude of flowers and plants. Absolutely stunning and a real MUST to see. If only the Air Cons withing the halls wouldn't be set soooo low: we were freezing!
,,Very picturesque,5.0,,The walk is fabulous but be prepared with comfy shoes as it's quite long. The signs are pretty clear and offer ample information to make it an educational and enjoyable tour altogether. Lovely replica of what a rainforest looks like. The rock section underneath is also a must see.
,,Nono for those afraid of heights,5.0,,Very relaxing place all though I just knew that I am afraid of heights. Though I really enjoyed the tour!
,,Interesting and really refreshing,4.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed the variety in the cloud forest. Getting to walk behind a waterfall (albeit an artificial one) was good fun. Very refreshing temperature when hot and sticky outside.
,,Unbelievable display,5.0,,This is the most stunning display of tropical pants I have ever seen and I would rate it as a must-see place for any visitor to Singapore. It is made even more attractive by the fact that the dome is air-conditioned and you can enjoy the experience in a comfortable environment.
,,A great getaway,4.0,,Great and amazing. A great getaway from the heat in the garden to this indoor facility with great views and good temperature.
,,A fantastic concept realized with wonderful construction.,5.0,,One can't decide whether the concept (of having a cloud forest here) is better than the actual construction. The easy access enhances the enjoyment. The variety of plants and flowers is amazing. The way it is maintained is unique. No adequate words to describe it .
,,So beautiful and informative,4.0,,Make it part of your 'Gardens in the Bay' visit and take tour time as you enjoy the cool and wonderfully fresh air. Your kids will live you for taking them.
,,Looks quite real,5.0,,This is one of the paid dome in Gardens by the Bay. They have created cloud Forest amazingly well. This Dome is also air conditioned and worth the ticket price.
,,Fake waterfall with a fake cave ...,1.0,,"Wet, cold and artificial. Why would anyone pay $10 for this? It was clearly not educational nor entertaining - plus, it had a collection of amethyst geodes like a truly bad new age store. Completely laughable when you think how much money must have gone into this. BIG FAIL."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,Never seen anything like this. The people who planned and designed this facility went way beyond my imagination. From the moment you enter until you leave it is impressive and informative. Also a great place to escape the heat and humidity.
,,Exactly as you see in the 1 picture,2.0,,"There really isn't much more to this place than you'll see in the pictures. if you're going to see something different then this place isn't it. Don't get me wrong a waterfall off a rock in a dome is an impressive feet of architecture, but its nothing to write home about.

Worth a visit if you're not paying (which you have to do, and it's not cheap), or if you have never seen a waterfall."
,,special expirience,5.0,,"Very greeny, a lot of plants, futuristic, must see, pay ticket, stay almost 1 hour inside, go to the top,"
,,Excellent man made forest,4.0,,It's so nice and great creation of Singapore. One should not miss to see this. The varieties of the plant and walk over trees was an experience.for the children there is a water sprinkling place which is very nicely done. I loved this cloud forest.
,,Interesting attraction,4.0,,A very well done beautiful attraction. Can take lift up to the top and then a gentle walk downwards through beautifully landscaped designs. Nice view also of the marina bay area from the top.
,,amazing,5.0,,"great sight do visit and do the tour from the very top downwards. also view the video at the end, its impactful"
,,Breathtaking .,5.0,,"A 10 Storey high Waterfall , and artifitial clouds sum up the experience . Very disciplined tour of the dome . Overall a place that one must visit"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Wow experience on watching the artificial waterfall. Kids enjoy this area. Take the lift to the top of the mountaintop to discover the unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests, and then take a stroll along a walkway in the clouds for an aerial view of the canopy and mountainside below."
,,Mesmerizing Concept,5.0,,Loved it!! Visit during the evening so that you dont miss the Free Sound and Light show at Super Tree Grove!
,,Outstanding Man-made forest,5.0,,"Interesting, beautiful scenery and picturesque. Amazing educational experience with family and friend."
,,Fantastic Architectural and Natural Experience,5.0,,"One of my favourite sites in Singapore! There is an interesting meeting between modern, sleek, structure and natural beauty. The falls are gorgeous, the walkways suspended in air are scenic, and the orchids are beautiful. Awe inspiring and in the same vein as the surrounding park at night-- fascinating hybrid of nature and modernity.. makes for great pictures as well!"
,,An indoor Garden,4.0,,"Another man made Indoor Garden and Waterfall in Singapore.. Definitely beautifully designed.. Must go place for nature lovers.. You can find various varieties of plants, trees etc over here from around the world.. Lot of waterfalls.. This place is Located near Marina Bay Sands Hotel.."
,,Too many people,2.0,,I have visited this place before and this time it was not that special. Too many people because of the Chinice New Year- but I still love the buildings and the architechture of this place. Points would be 4/5 if there would been less people...
,,Misty misty,5.0,,Love it .. For its sheer massive structure - man made wonder... !! Cooling temperatures .. A big relief from soaring outside heat...
,,Excellent place,4.0,,"we visited this place in the evening and i was amazed with this place. awesome place. damn hot outside, but minute you enter this place you will feel this the place you should visit often. great show and waterfall too."
,,The indoor Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"If you can only visit one attraction at Gardens by the Bay, this is the best by far. . The Skytrees are just OK and the Flower Dome had a lot of desert plants and some Christmas decorations when we visited"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing says it all. A great educational experience to be enjoyed by all ages. The scale of this attraction is mind boggling and how they are able to maintain it is just incredible.
,,amazing!,5.0,,such a surreal experience to walk to the top of an indoor manmade waterfall! a must for tourist things to do in singapore
,,Tropical Paradise,5.0,,Refreshingly cool with each level a different theme. Cloud Mountain can be accessed by an elevator or you can descend by a circular path. The waterfall is spectacular as are the views from the top. What better way to cool off after walking around Gardens by the Bay.
,,So 'COOL' and the must-see attraction,5.0,,"Open the door in and the welcome coolness hits you....BIG style. The vast array of vegetation is amazing. There are even some plants made with LEGO!!. Plenty of lifts to get up to the top and take a leisurely wander back down. The viewing platforms are unbelievably high and the sky walks are not for people with a fear of heights .....however, this place is a must. Don't miss the Rocks.
The shop at the end has real quality stuff too."
,,Interesting indoor attraction.,3.0,,An interesting attraction in the Marina Bay Gardens. Tickets are $14 per person (there are two attractions which mean $28 for both). There is a lift to the top followed by a walkway through a simulated rain forest experience. The better of the two attractions - but only visit once !
,,Amazing both architecturally and visually,5.0,,The sheer size of the glasshouse takes your breathe away. You have to experience it to actually believe it. It is well worth a visit. Highly recommended.
,,go on a less crowded day and during the day,4.0,,went on a crowded day and didnt get to enjoy as we had to keep moving. best to go during the day with sunlight to be able to see the fauna better.. then move on to flower dome as they have lighting. love the waterfall !
,,Waste of time,2.0,,It was waste of time for us. Nothing special. No need to visit and pay for the ticket . Garden is free and nice at it is.
,,loved Japanese Garden,5.0,,"I wonder how they provide such a garden!!!!! this garden has all different season of flowers, different countries, it worth to visit here!"
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,Indeed a very beautiful and one of the best attraction in Singapore! Worth visiting especially with your family. Satay by the bay is a must try too!
,,Nice place to hangout,4.0,,"Large variety of plants etc but even if your not into such things, it is still worth a look, the waterfall is nice and air conditioning is nice way to escape the heat."
,,"Lovely place to stay cool, take lift to the top",5.0,,"take lift to the top, then walk the 6 levels down. Different views including water falls at each level, nice photo opportunities"
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,Loved the suspended walkways throughout the dome. Amazing displays. Enjoyable for everyone. I would highly recommend!
,,What an experience,5.0,,"We visited the cloud forest just before sunset and it was wonderful. There is a walkway all the way to the top of the massive waterfall and lots to see along the way up. The walkway lights up when it gets dark, which also makes for some beautiful scenery."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,This is a stunning place to visit - very lush greenery and cooling mist off the waterfall make it a great destination on a hot Singapore day. The flowers and plants are well kept and the video and displays near the exit are educational and thought provoking. I would recommend it to young and old. Lovely!
,,Pretty good,4.0,,"So many amazing plants and varied colour flowers, makes cloud forest like one of Amazon! The rock exhibits are also to be noted."
,,Well worth the entrance fee,5.0,,A special place with fantastic photo overrunities of flowers and foliage. Better that the Edan centre in England
,,Walking in the air,5.0,,Taka a walk at the sky walkway in the cloud forest and you will feel like walking in the air. The environment is such that at the same time you feel like living in the Avatar world.
,,Enter into another realm of nature,4.0,,"The place is super cold for my family and I when we step inside. There's a waterfall from a height that adds to the cold temperature. Cloud forest is beautiful with nature flowers as if you entered into a world of faeries. If you are not scared of heights you can try the sky walk, even if you are phobia of heights, force yourself to walk and hold on to the handles. The view and scenery is very worth it to watch.

But it was only a little enclosed area so it wouldn't take a long time to finish exploring the place."
,,Gorgeous Indoor Gardens,5.0,,Lovely place to visit on a hot day. These gardens are beautiful and a must visit at least once even if your not an enthusiasts like me of nature and plants and flowers. Incredible amount of variety of plants from around the world.

,,Cool cool place in Singapore,5.0,,"Against the heat, this place is a cool haven. A very good place to relax and enjoy the coolness in the warm Singapore!"
,,MIND BLOWING !!!,5.0,,"You absolutely have to visit this. !!! I think I wore my camera out taking photos, it's really a world class exhibition of plants."
,,""" Amazing """,5.0,,"So relaxing to visit taking in the lovely waterfall & all the different varieties of plants. Lovely to walk around sit & take in the wonderful nature.
Make sure you take a jacket as can be cool & damp.
Many photo opportunities.
Take the lift for more great views ."
,,Best gardens ever,5.0,,"Entire family (ages 10-50) loved this place. Took probably 500 pics between the 6 of us. My wife said; ""Wouldn't it be great to come here everyday."" I think that says it all."
,,It felt real?,4.0,,"Recreated tropical forest and some of the fauna from different parts of the world. A little bit lifeless, but very attractive to se."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,We loved this dome - it is more impressive than the Flower Dome. Well worth a visit. Would do it again on our next visit to Singapore.
,,"nature, waterfall so beautiful",4.0,,this place will make you feel same you live with nature! high waterfall and the great view from 7 floor!
,,Nice place to spend an afternoon,5.0,,perfect place to escape the heat of Singapore in this cool controlled environment. Amazing surreal experience to climb the man-made mountain and look at all the interesting plants.
,,Great place for pictures and views,5.0,,"Been there with the whole family July 2015. We love the views from up high and took lots of pictures. Will i go back there again? No, it is a one time trip for me."
,,Nice walk in the 'cloud forest',3.0,,"I didn't expect anything more than this, so I feel satisfied. It's as much as you can do with the nature in the middle of the city. Nice scenery, all taken care of and in a good shape, but I guess this was my first and last time there - I prefer the real nature."
,,A man-made tropical forest .,3.0,,Enjoy the man-made indoor forest in Singapore. it is a Green House. It is very beautiful with peaceful music played in the background.
,,The most interesting part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is the most interesting part of gardens by the bay. If you really are interested in plants, go there during a weekday (not weekend) and as early as possible to avoid crowds."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I actually am a bit undecided about how to review this attraction, I did like it but... it's an amazing structure and pretty cool but really it is just a huge vertical garden inside a great big dome. Pretty to look at though. If you aren't interested in gardening skip this."
,,nice experience,4.0,,A bit expensive but that is Singapore... nice and unusual and good for all ages. Bring your scarf though!
,,amazing,5.0,,"The place is amazing. Good for visit once. We went as a couple. It took us around half an hour to complete the walk on a Sunday afternoon. You will take lift to 6 th floor. Its good on a rainy day as well. The whole park is covered. We went in the afternoon at 4.30pm - did flower dome first and then cloud forest, by then it was little dark so we were lucky to see the lights in the garden outside."
,,Nice attraction and expensive,5.0,,"There are two attractions in the Gardens by the Bay that you have yo pay for, and more beautiful is the Cloud Forest. There you цан find many species of plants including prehistoric ones and even plants made of Lego!"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"That's super nice and very pleasant experience that we had! Nature + Modernity - that's also very informative I guess you could spend 2/3 hours there alone, in couple, or with a family."
,,Beautiful #2,4.0,,Everything is so beautiful in here and this is no different. You can spend easily there couple of hours. It's breathtaking at some points and you will love it. Gets busy during weekends.
,,Interesting,5.0,,Lovely indoor garden. It is very cold inside but fun to walk around. I preferred this one to the flower dome.
,,Cloud forest.. give it a try..live it love it...,5.0,,We had been to cloud forest on 6th march 2016.. people must visit place of gardens by the bay.. artificial biggest waterfall on floor 7.. continues water falling out.. a broadway walk as well lift and stair case available for tourist and senior citizens .. all types of greenery available on this place.. looked very beautiful.. sun rays makes little rainbows all the time. We can see the pic in our dreams..or seems like a fairy tell... such a beutiful place.. people took hundreds of pics... we enjoyed the place.
,,An island oxygen,5.0,,And do not miss the camera . A spectacular pass you into the heart of the forest in Singapore . The visit takes about 45 minutes.
,,"Awesome waterfall, greenery and lovely cloud forest",5.0,,"Cloud forest is the part of gardens by the bay. I have paid 28$ for both cloud forest and flower dome. Just after you enter the cloud forest, a giant waterfall welcomes you and captivates you to feel the breeze around it. Lovely feeling. Than you ascend your journey upwards to view the other parts of cloud forest. Lovely plants and flowers are in plenty and you surely feel enthralled by the beauty it offers. As you ascend more towards the top, the surrounding view from the top is worth watching and give you feel how beautiful Singapore is. Overall cloud forest is worth watching and should not be missed."
,,Excellent feat of Human will and enginuity,4.0,,"creating an atmosphere of around 3000 mt above sea level on an island close to tropics and bay is really amazing.

The walk here is pleasant and informative! the atmosphere is cool and gives a break to travelers who may have had a sunny ride through the day

recommended time to visit is evening before sunset so travelers can also view the mesmerizing night time view of these gardens"
,,Beautifull greenhouse,4.0,,This was the most beautifull place in gardens by the bay. Very nicely done greenhouse. I would recommend if you like nature.
,,Good Add On!,5.0,,"We paid the S$16 to add on the Cloud Forest. Overall very please with the experience, it was nice and cool inside on a hot day. You start at the top and work your way down at your own pace.

It it unique and one of a kind."
,,A rain forest in the clouds,4.0,,Brilliantly designed multi level gardens. An indoor rain forest. Look out for the Venus flytrap and pitcher plants.
,,stunning jaw dropping views,5.0,,amazing place to visit $14each about £7. jaw dropping views as you get to the top on escalators. very dry inside but lots of water fountains. amazing waterfall as you enter
,,Tree top walking,5.0,,This was a pleasant surprise I had no idea what it was when I went there. WOW it is amazing. The indoor waterfall is amazing. Walking through the tree tops and seeing Singapore in the background was just beautiful. A must see. Cost from memory was around $33 for this and the Flower Dome which is also a wonder in itself.
,,Like being in Fern Gully,5.0,,LOVED this place - especially after walking around in the humid heat. More florals here than in the actual Flower Dome (I believe because of timing). ? But loved it.
,,Stunning waterfalls,5.0,,"Stunning waterfalls in a climate controlled conservatory complete with cascading plants, accessible at all levels."
,,Really interesting visitor attraction not to be missed!,5.0,,"A tremendous logistical achievement with a superb collection of trees and flowers offering great views of the city, and all in an air conditioned atmosphere."
,,An amazing spectacle,5.0,,"A real tropical waterfall within a glass dome. Has to be seen to be believed.Amazing engineering, creative planting. Numerous great photo opportunities."
,,This ecodome is worth a visit,4.0,,"Inside the dome is a simulation of the indigenous rainforest, seen on different elevation levels. Besides being very informative, the dome is impressive to see with a very nice atmosphere to walk through."
,,Nice Place to visit,5.0,,Nice Place to visit when you are in Gardens By The Bay. Only a one time watch stuff. Specially not worth. Its calm and cool to climb up. Good Experience for first time visitors.
,,Superb!,5.0,,this is a MUST during your visit to Singapore. Brilliantly done and truly fascinating. We loved our time there.
,,Highlight of Singapore holiday,5.0,,"To kill a few hours on our last day before heading to the airport we visited Cloud Forest. WOW! what a way to end our trip to Singapore. I doubt I can add anything more to all the glowing reviews that have already been written about this attraction. It is simply stunning and a must-see. We happened to arrive just a few minutes before the midday misting, which really added to the magical experience. Misting takes place every two hours so would highly recommend timing a visit to see the fabulous cloud effect."
,,Impressive building but nothing special!,3.0,,"I visited in January with a friend, i expected much more, but actually nothing much, interesting building, maybe the idea is good but in general not much to see, also very cold inside. its open till 7 i think or 8 but when we were there was too dark also cant see much, better change the last admission earlier."
,,"Incredible Architecture, Unusual Plants, interesting Walkways",5.0,,"December 30, 2015 - While visiting Singapore, we stopped by the two huge domes near Marina Bay; Gardens By the Bay and Cloud Forest. You can buy a ticket to just one or to both at the ticket counter. We went into the Gardens By the Bay first which still had Christmas decorations. I reviewed the Gardens By the Bay in a separate review.

This review is for the Cloud Forest dome. As you walk a short distance from the Gardens By the Bay dome to Cloud Forest dome, nothing prepares you for the first sight once you enter the Cloud Forest dome. Your first sight is a waterfall that comes tumbling down from the very top of the plant covered artificial structure to the cement floor in front of you. it is pretty amazing. As you walk around the plant covered artificial structure, you can see walkways at the top and the plant details until you get to an elevator.

Once you get to the top of the dome, you slowly walk around the walkways in a circular manner and enjoy the various orchids and other low light, moisture dependent plants. Photo opportunities are everywhere. You can see the huge Singapore Flyer Ferris wheel and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel through the glass dome.

The Cloud Forest is the most creative and unusual artificial greenhouse I have ever seen. Don't miss it!"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Pictures will probably never do this attraction justice! From the moment you step in it's as if you've entered another world!

A welcome reprieve from Singapore's humidity, heat and rain makes it a great indoor activity!

The Cloud Forest Dome was only $14 per adult and the girlfriend and I stayed here for close to 2 hours. It's very educational and teaches you about cloud forests, many different types of flowers, limestone caves and how global warming will affect the planet in the next 100 years.

Try to be here during the misting times as it makes it seem like you're walking through the clouds!"
,,Absolutely fabulous ...,5.0,,"I really thought this was absolutely fabulous ... much better than the other dome (the Flower Dome).

When we visited it was an extremely hot, humid, grey day, with threatening storms, and so it was lovely to come into this enormous dome and immediately feel cool, thanks in part to the immense waterfall and the constant misting of the plants.

We went up to the top of the ""mountain"" in the lift/elevator, and were amazed when we stepped out and found ourselves in a magical wonderland of misty pools, ferns, pitcher plants, orchids, and other flowers. It is beautifully done and definitely has a ""wow"" factor ... We went down a few levels in the lift and then descended the rest of the way by the aerial walkways, omitting the top one, which is quite frightening if you have a fear of heights (and I wouldn't suggest walking out on the platform which looks rather like a diving board at the top of the ""mountain"" either, unless you don't mind heights.

The sides of the ""mountain"" are also stunningly planted and have some wood sculptures and carvings placed in amongst the leaves and flowers.

Definitely recommended."
,,"Fabulous and I have been in several ""real"" rain forests!",5.0,,This is a spectacular display. You can take a lift to the top and make your way down while looking at a huge variety of plants and great displays.
,,Must see,5.0,,"Must visit. Extraordinary what is possible to build and maintain. Lush gardens and waterfall, nice walk, very impressive. Take scarf with You because it is pretty chilly vs outdoors."
,,Amazing ....,5.0,,"I visited this place after my business hours. It was almost 7 pm when i reached. The place closes down at 9 pm. Since, I did not have any time I decided to visit the closed areas - Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. It costs 20$ for one exhibit and 28$ for two... for foreigners. I got a two exhibit ticket and decided to visit the Cloud Forest first. It turned to be the right decision.

Its an amazing creation of the mountain top from rain forest with a waterfall from the top. Its almost six storey tall artificial mountain. One starts from the top and walks down. All the floors are amazing experiences. The info boards are also informative. Do view the +5% video. After the video, there is an exhibit of the layout and the sustainability features built. You will have to stand near the exhibit and view the video on the wall. Do not miss this. It shows how the gardens have been built below the ground. It was almost 8.30 pm by the time i walked out.

This is a must visit place if in Singapore.Also, budget a full day at this place. It should be wonderful during the sun light hours."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,We spend most of one day at the Gardens by the Bay - included the Cloud Forest - really done well - very entertaining - really special.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Though m not of a flower fan but it was a nice change to check out the large species of plants and flowers on display at the cloud forest ... The place is impressive as the atmosphere is completely controlled and maintained in a mist just for the plants

Recommend a visit"
,,Worth the entry fee,5.0,,"This is one of the most impressive garden conservatory buildings you will ever experience. Beautiful flowers, plants, wood sculptures and interesting interpretive signage."
,,Absolutely loved it!,5.0,,"With a mist of waterfall, beautiful smell of floral, pretty flowers and plants, I am in love with this place!"
,,Very unique!,5.0,,"I'd never experienced anything like this - beautiful gardens, waterfall and views! Also lots of important info regarding climate change and there are activities for the kids. Just get there early!"
,,Wow!!,5.0,,"This is a MUST see. Very interesting architecture and design. Easy to access with very helpful staff on hand, if needed.
The descriptions of all the plants and exhibits are very clear and precise without being over technical. Allow at least 2-3 hours here, you will not be disappointed."
,,The waterfall was awesome,5.0,,"The kids kept on running in and out if the waterfall area and getting wet from the water sprays, definitely fun even for adults!"
,,High tech paradise,5.0,,"I have never seen anything like it, a vertical garden. Perfect way to spend a hot or rainy day in SGP as its air conditioned, cool place. I recommend that you avoid coming here during weekends as the lines were massive, and we dropped it previously because of the crowds. Not recommended for small kids, or people afraid of heights."
,,A real rainforest snippet,5.0,,"A real rainforest awaits you here! Only the animals are missing. The waterfall, the lush flora, the mist make the perfect ambience of a real jungle! The staff takes you to the top of the cliff with an elevator then you can walk around down it to wonder in the vegetation! Unbelievable experience! The place is handicapped friendly!"
,,Giant waterfalls and Chilly weather,4.0,,Cloud Forest: I personally feel this dome to be a little overrated. It features a 35-metre-tall mountain with the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. I loved the purple (the color at night) falls. And the chilly weather is a relief in the hot Singapore days. We went a little late in the night so we were able to see the SuperTrees lit up and the downtown lights as well. Walking through the man-made fog was a nice touch to make you feel like you’re in some hill station (i.e. 2000 metres above sea level). Do go right to the top and go on the suspended walkways. At the end there is a route to the Secret Garden where they show you how the gardens are self-sustaining and use the solar energy from the SuperTree and plant waste material for generating energy.
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,Amazing to walk round this very high structure (beware if you don't like heights!) and see the myriad of tropical plants.
,,Sculptures,5.0,,"Keep eyes open for the wooden sculptures hidden in the foliage .AlsoThe plants shaped into monkeys,I think mostly because we were there when the Year of the monkey was being celebrated."
,,Amazing rainforest replica,5.0,,"Amazing waterfall greats you at the entrance and it's lovely and cool so it's either the perfect place to escape the heat or rain depending on what's hopping outside! Many interesting plants and artistic layouts nit to mention a lego pitcher display, walkways are great too."
,,Cool place on a hot afternoon,5.0,,"It is very much worth walking through the cloud forest. It recreates a climate typical for the cloud forests of Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Borneo amongst other places. Very beautiful place, everything is masterfully explained and us worth the 16 dollars fee!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This structure is truly amazing and you enter it and there is a magnificent waterfall which instantly cools you. Take a lift up to the 6th floor and then walk down through the plants and see the views.
,,Relief from the heat,4.0,,Loved this. Not ideal if you are scared of heights ) try the other attraction in the same venue). This was very cool (temperature) and interesting place within Gardens by the Bay.
,,Must. Visit,5.0,,The new botanic gardens in Singapore are a mix of architecture and nature...the cloud forest is an amazing attraction...must see if in Singapore
,,Great for a family visit,5.0,,Its an amazing concept and made brilliantly. Waterfall at the entrance is one of our favourite feature here.
,,Gorgeous!!!!!!,5.0,,This is inside Gardens by the Bay. It was my favorite garden! Truly beautiful and peaceful! Definitely go see it! I also went in the Flower Dome which was equally incredible!
,,Lovely,5.0,,"On a visit here in August 2015 and again just recently,spent some time here out of the humid conditions of Singapore.Wow what a lovely experience,and refreshing with waterfalls and plenty of blooming flowers and plants.Although on my most recent trip Feb 2016 it seemed a bit lack lustre.But still love it here as with all the Gardens precinct.Avery pleasant experience."
,,amazing experience,4.0,,went there with my old lady and we were amazed about the brilliant construction and nice views on the different levels of this cloud forest.... a must to go for every visitor to the town... but as well for us locals..
,,A must,4.0,,Amazing structure well worth a look and a climb to the top. Would do this one instead of the other if you had to choose.
,,Nice attraction,4.0,,"This was my daughter's favorite, but I preferred the other Gardens by the Bay attractions. Go when it's hot outside and escape the heat."
,,Should visit it once,5.0,,Great concept to create this environment in middle of such equatorial sun. Worth the price they charge.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Right when you walk in the place makes you gasp. It's like walking into Jurassic park!! A highly recommended going to see it
,,So amazing !,5.0,,There were many more plants in the cloud forest that weren't in the observatory. I loved the little Mario & Luigi set up with the real plants that the game's are modeled after. I honestly didn't know they existed anywhere!
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,Walked into this building and was amazed by the waterfall infront of us. The building was amazing and it was really nice being able to walk on the overhanging walkways to view both the plants but also the views outside of the river and gardens.
,,amazing forest in town,5.0,,"I think Singapore has a good view forest in town, so that u must visit cloud forest. And take picture"
,,Must see!,5.0,,"This was a must see in Singapore, expect a couple hours to see the whole thing. Best to go just before sunset."
,,Amazing,5.0,,One of the best sights in Singapore...and very cool inside. Go visit both of the domes in the Gardens by the bay.
,,"Beautiful, cool spot for midday heat",5.0,,"Time your visit to gardens by the bay to be in cloud forest for the midday sun. Its wonderfully cool, and the light will be great for all the selfies you'll take against the extraordinarily beautiful backdrop."
,,SURREAL,5.0,,The cloud forest was something out of a sci fi movie. It's super fun and educational for both children and adults.
,,Such excellent value for something quite different,5.0,,"For only $16 this is totally worth a visit, I enjoyed every moment of it. Kids and adults will love it alike."
,,Fantastic and a must do in Singapore,5.0,,There are a handful of negative reviews about this attraction. I don't believe any are worthy criticism. The place is beautiful. It is a lot colder inside than it is outside so you may wish to bring a jacket. I am not generally a botanical...More
,,Almost defies description,5.0,,"Imagine a 60 ft indoor waterfall on an artificial mountain covered with real vegetation, ponds etc, and dotted with unusual artwork. It also has breathtaking aerial walkways - not recommended if you have a fear of heights, although it is perfectly safe."
,,Highlight of Gardens on the Bay,5.0,,Excellent modern development with amazing Cloud Forest experience all inside a controlled environment dome. The misting system will maintain the humidity and also get you damp but the experience is well worth it as a lasting memory.
,,Man-made waterfall and mountain,5.0,,"A sister exhibition with the Gardens by the Bay, we saw the various orchids, plants ferns etc through the descending levels of the artificial mountain highlighting the differences in the rainfall or the mist.. There were also exhibitions of vertical gardens."
,,Impressive waterfall,4.0,,Has a huge manmade waterfalls and the mist generation system is also very efficient. Stalagmite section is also good.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The air in this place 'smells' incredible, like pure oxygen, fresh! Well organised and worth the entry fee. Good way to spend a couple of hours. The orchids are amazing."
,,Highest imitate waterfall,5.0,,"It's one of attraction inside the garden by the bay.. you have to buy a ticket to enter, don't forget to used any warm cloth since it was very cold air inside"
,,Unique architecture with a waterfall for misting the tropical plants.,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest at the Gardens at the Bay is probably one of the best architectural designs for a botanical garden. You can walk up the trail to the top of the waterfall. Where it mists all the tropical foliage. Wear comfortable shoes that has good treads. The ground is wet and slippery. As for the acrophobics, the walkways can be a little uneasy walking. Open grating where you view down below. The walkway have a solid center area, but as you walk it narrows down.

Photography is a really good if you can keep your lens dry!"
,,Wonderful and unique!,5.0,,"Bring your camera! The walkways jut out around the cloud forest mountain, what a great way to see plants up close. We loved it! The surrounding park is free, but you need to pay for tickets for the cloud mountain."
,,Big waterfall,3.0,,Becareful..the area near to waterfall are slippery..and the water might splash.. Also pls prepare for your stamina if you want to stroll around because this area is quite big
,,Stunning - well worth a visit,5.0,,Most unusual venue - loved the walk down by the waterfall. So many flwoers and plants - made for a great afternoon
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This is a must see for travel lovers to Singapore. Stunning architecture , so much to see and learn about sustainability"
,,Attraction you must visit,5.0,,Amazing beautiful inside. Every photo taken turn out to be beautiful . You can spend a good 2 hours walk inside. This is one of the place you MUST visit in Singapore.
,,Great experience,4.0,,Enjoyed this but had to rush because it was too cold for my fiancee. She took one step inside and stepped right out again. From 30 degrees outside stepping inside can be a shock to the system - take a jersey.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Don't miss this breathtaking place, cool when it's hot outside too. We were in awe of the place, well worth a morning visit"
,,Probably my most favourite part of the Gardens,4.0,,The cloud Forrest was really lovely and a nice cool get away from the haet.Lots of waterfalls and water loving plants.Ponds and multilevels of plants.Really well done and worth the money paid to go in
,,Paradise in Singapore,5.0,,"If you haven't been to the Cloud Forest in Singapore, you just haven't seen the best of the city. Haven been living in Singapore for 9 months now, I have now been there 4 times, and enjoyed each visit. I love it how they keep on changing the setup, so there is often new things to see. The architectural setup is totally marvelous. If there is one place in Singapore I wouldn't miss, this would be it."
,,A walk in the Clouds,5.0,,Very impressive structure which is a perfect blend of human architecture and homage to nature...fear of heights can be a factor but its well worth pushing thru the experience.. Definitely a first for me. I loved it..
,,Must Visit Place in Singapore,5.0,,"Its a Man made forest which makes you feel you are in an absolute cloudy and misty forest. Had a good experience, me and my wife enjoyed it lot. We skipped flower dome and took entrance for this one."
,,"""Curiousity""",5.0,,"It's a very smart to create the such big forest inside the dome.
You have to prepare stamina to walk around. Bring your camera because you will got new experience in the high bridge, really looks like in the cloud.
To enter this place , you must buy a ticket (buy at your hotel, sometimes they give you a special price: 21$Sin instead 25$. With this price you are free to access two dome. Flower and Cloud Forest.
You better go here around 2 pm and stay at this Garden By The Bay until sunset."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Never seen anything like this before, really spectacular at the entrance. Also it is educational within, so i suggest spend some quiet time relax in this garden."
,,great place !,4.0,,a very interesting place to visit. very different and it makes you feel like you're in some kind of modern jungle. worth the visit !
,,huge waterfall and various things interested,4.0,,like a fresh water from huge waterfall make me feel good and cool so many to see around cloud dome and sky high walking on the cloud dome make me fantastic views
,,Excellent.,4.0,,"Greeted by the iconic waterfall, it simply invites you in. Great view and photo opportunities of the waterfall and a nice short film at the end about global warming."
,,Very ecotastic up to a point,4.0,,"Ok so it is a bit of a cliche I guess, building a waterfall and rain forest inside a glass dome.

Still you have to admire the engineering and the cool walkways you can go on.

My one critique is that in the basement on your way out they have a film on the effect of CO2 on global warming and of course they go over the ways ""we"" can help such as driving less,, conserving energy and buying eco friendly things etc. But they DIDN'T mention that the western style diet, high in meat and the resulting intensive farming is one of the biggest CO2 contributors. Maybe it makes the people watching it too uncomfortable ?"
,,A delightful and magnificent oasis,5.0,,What a wonderful place to wander around and relax. Singapore has done a marvellous job in developing this gem in the heart of the city. Wonderful floral tributes and the orchids are absolutely not to be missed!
,,Beautiful part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is one of two huge domed conservatories in Gardens by the Bay (entrance fee $28S for both). The Cloud Forest is a mini rain forest with lots of interesting flora and fauna and an aerial walkway. There is a short video on climate change toward the end of the walk.
,,"Fantastic, especially as you enter the dome",5.0,,Really well designed and dramatic plant display. The impact when we entered the dome took our breath away....and not just because it is cold compared with outside!
,,Exceptional experience,4.0,,"‘WOW!’ That was the very first reaction when I along with wife and kid entered into the Cloud Dome and stand in front of the huge fountain! The dome is really an amazing creation of mini rainforest. Every floor of the multistoried forest is a wonderful creation. The trail, the sky bridge, the cave, the huge variety of flora & fauna… … …everything will make you feel that you are in a forest though in reality you are actually at a pure city with all the hustling and bustling.

Would surely recommended this place for the travelers going to Singapore for business or pleasure."
,,Better of the two indoor experiences at Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"BOTTOM LINE: A refreshing stop when visiting Gardens by the Bay

GOOD:
* Aircon. If you're in the midst of the Singapore heat, the aircon in here is a Godsend
* Waterfall concept - Weaving in and around the waterfall from top to bottom is really interesting concept, and make it a lot of fun
* Better than the Flower Dome. If you can only go to one, go here
* Crowds - I've been here a few times and it's never too bad

BAD
* Value - tickets a are *rough*"
,,AMAZING man meets nature structure,5.0,,"My jaws dropped upon entering this structure. You'll be faced with a man made waterfall, flowing down from this majestic plant adorned mountain. It feels so modern yet so natural at the same time. As if you are in a real rainforest (but very clean and safe).

The walkways at the top are amazing, and the little informational panels are very interesting and good to read. Very educational as well. It's even child stroller friendly since they have ramps. Highly recommended! Don't miss this attraction."
,,Awe-inspiring,5.0,,"When we went inside the Cloud Forest Dome, we couldn't hold back our cries of 'Oooh' and 'Ahhhh'. When we saw the towering waterfalls in front of us, we knew we were someplace special.
The ticket price for this dome was worth it, even if you're not a plant or gardening enthusiast."
,,The World of Avatar,5.0,,"When entering this dome, i'm like in the world of fantasy. Nothing can express how amazed i am as i strolling toward the track. The architecture, waterfall, plants, interior, all was perfect. At the end of your visit, you'll see some display rooms that reminds us how important of our world, nature and environment.

Admission fee is 28 SGD combined with Flower Dome. To get there, you can either take downtown line or circle line MRT to Bayfront and then take a 10 minutes walk to Garden by the Bay."
,,Great Visit,5.0,,What a fantastic place. And a great place to escape the punishing SIN heat!! Make sure to take advantage of the very cheap orchids in the gift shop. If not to liven up your hotel room during your stay.
,,Another man made wonder from Singapore,3.0,,The waterfall at the entry just sweeps the visitors off their feet. A nice place for relaxing and admiring of what man is capable to making and mimicking nature.
,,Didn't know it was there - so glad we went,5.0,,"Didn't know it was there but so glad we went. Of course, Singapore is constantly changing - always seemingly for the better and this is one example of it. Exciting as it is a great tower that you get a lift to the top and spiral walk down seeing the rain forest from above and within."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Very easy place to lose track of time, had to be reminded to leave. Access for those with mobility issues very good."
,,Great place to visit and better than Flower dome,5.0,,"Came here with my wife during Chinese New Year (9 Feb) and was quite impressed with it. We are not normally plant-interested people but this place was quite cool (literally!!). On entering, the waterfall is quite impressive and the place is regulated temperature-wise so it's a good escape from the humidity and heat outside. Good resemblance of a rainforest and we were here for the mist/fog which was nice. The short film at the end about global warming is an eye-opener. We thought this was better than the flower dome. You can buy a combo ticket for both which we did."
,,Lovely!,5.0,,As soon as you enter a huge water wall with cold winds welcome you! It is very beautiful and unique. Loved it.
,,Really Impressive,5.0,,"Huge, a lot of things to see and interesting. We visit it during a rainny day, not a problem (even probably better with sun)."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"On entering this attraction you can feel the spray from the impressive indoor waterfall. A lift takes you to the top of the dome and then you follow the spiral walkway down at your own pace. I thoroughly enjoyed meandering around, admiring the plants and sculptures. There was plenty to see with lots of photo opportunities.

Would recommend a visit when in Singapore. Excellent value for money."
,,Don't go on CNY and Don't bring baby stroller with you.,3.0,,"Amazing indoor waterfall. Unfortunately, we went there in Chinese New Year. Too many visiter at the time. It was really difficult to stop and take a picture. Plus, we went with a baby stroller. After we got on the top, we gave up to see rest of the floor. We took elevator straight back to the ground because, everyone were walking stairs down. We don't want to wait elevator in each floor."
,,Fabulous,4.0,,"Climate controlled Eco-system recreating a mountainous environment. You are greeted by a waterfall upon entry. It is also impossible not to notice the cool air.

This dome allows plants to flourish at ground level, in a warm country. It also allows people to experience them.

Suitable for a rainy day. A lovely walk through nature. This should be done with the Flower dome."
,,Beautifully created,4.0,,"Worth the fee to go in, beautifully created and the waterfall - well that was lovely. What you don't see when you go in is the walkway the other side. You get the lift to the top and work your way down the levels. At the top is an amazing little garden of Eden where the Waterfall starts. Wasn't sure on one of the lower levels, where they have stalactites and stalagmites, I'm hoping that they were replicas as they were very big. However, that being said the plants, flowers and sculptures were amazingly well kept."
,,Unique...,3.0,,"A unique experience.. Multiple floors - you can keep walking and seeing the wonderful creations - great colours, great designs, great arrangements, great patterns - a different view each time."
,,Nature tripping,4.0,,Although it was only man made you could appreciate nature and strolling inside...we find it cool that it has waterfalls a lovely treat after walking under the heat of the sun outside.
,,Nice place to cool off,4.0,,A nice cool place to run to when it gets too hot outside. Wait for the fog/mist to come out. And watch the short film on the effect of rising temperatures on earth. An eye-opener.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Beautiful to see. The combination of the architecture of the building and the forest built inside was very special.
,,See together with Flower Dome,5.0,,This attraction is seven stories high but entirely enclosed in a glass dome which allows them to control the temperature and humidity on each level. The bottom is tropical rainforest and the top much colder. I recommend you carry a jacket and wear it at least on the upper levels. The exhibitions are really good.
,,Best value ever for a sight seeing extravaganza,5.0,,"I cant believe how amazing this place is! Just walking into the cool was bliss on legs, then walking through mist to see the hugest array of plants I have ever seen. The pathway becomes an airial l walk way once you take the lift to the 6th floor then walk down. Apart from the plants, what was truely amazing were the statues made out of driftwood, which were attached to walls or protruding out of the plants. Dont skimp on time - one could spend at least 2 hours in this place - and then there is the other plant dome to explore.
There are posters along the way that provide clear information about the plants and the habitat they are from. Definitely worth a visit"
,,"Each time, different",5.0,,"I had the privilege of coming back few times, and each time, it was different. You could never say: I had enough"
,,waterfall inside,5.0,,"This is an amazing place, best place to cool down on a hot day, the huge array of plants, wood sculptures throughout are amazing."
,,A Must to Visit when you are in Singapore!,5.0,,"Well Done, with climate well control and nice botanic plants of various kind can be found here. I am a member there since day one, friends of the garden. Plant and flowers lovers cannot miss!"
,,"Lovely, lovely, lovely",5.0,,"An entirely different experience, while you walk through the tall walkways filled with different plants."
,,Very Refreshing,5.0,,"Im so in love with this SG Attraction. Cold temperature , very refreshing , and the typical plants that grows in those conditions. You can climb to the hill , enter in caves , at a very interesting tour. This is very unique and Superb. By the way I forgot I Love the Falls :)"
,,Awesome place to enjoy,4.0,,"I like this artificial place that with man-made waterfall and tropical forest. You know, it is so hot outside in Singapore. So, it is so comfortable to walk around this cool place. Definitely worth to visit. Also, don't miss the mist time, it made you to feel like in the fairy tale world."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,A miracle of engineering and nature makes this place a must visit when in Singapore. Parking can be quick difficult during special occassions and maybe the crowd inside could be reduced but amazing nonetheless.
,,Magnificent man-made architecture,4.0,,"I was welcomed by a grand man-made waterfall the moment I entered the cloud forest dome. The structure and range of plants showcased was quite amazing, not to mention the cooling temperature was a great relief from the hot weather outside the dome."
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,"On a very hot day, this was great place to cool down! You feel transported to a tropical forest. The architecture is worth a visit alone and the nature inside is memorising. Fantastic photo opportunities!"
,,"Spectacular Place, good for all age groups. ;)",5.0,,"Living in SG, you will never see this unless you get into Cloud Forest, trust me its worth the ticket! And pls remember to bring a jacket or wear smth warmer when you enter!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Breathtaking views! Amazing experience! Especially during mist period. It makes this feel more mysterious. Though it was a little bit scary for me due to the height, this conservation is simply unbelievable!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This is one of two conservatories at gardens by the bay - the better one, in my opinion. Really unique and quite stunning. Stroller-friendly. And chilly inside!"
,,Best part of the gardens.,4.0,,"Probably the best part of the gardens by the bay, pay at the door probably take about 30-45mins to walk through everything. Be prepared even on a hot day it was cold inside...."
,,Cooling and beautiful,5.0,,"Temperature in the Cloud Forest is considerably lower than outside. Greeted with a waterfall at the entrance. As the platforms are transparent in some places, ladies may want to avoid wearing short skirts."
,,Just Spectacular,5.0,,Expect to do a ton of walking - this place is just spectacular and you will not want to miss it. You can go up to the top and wind your way down the catwalk - each view is better than the next. Really unique and beautiful.
,,Mrs,5.0,,Breathtaking. Got a little damp and chilly up there so would recommend visitors take a waterproof and/or warm coat. Not ideal for young children but would highly recommend to anyone in their teens or older. It puts our planet's fragility into perspective and makes you realise what there is to lose if we don't act immediately.
,,Impressive & Worth Checking Out,5.0,,"We walked from Marina Bay Sands through the Gardens by the Bay and around the Supertree Grove. We ended up arriving at the flower dome and the Cloud Forest.

I think for tourists you needed to buy a ticket to the flower dome and Cloud Forest as one.The flower dome is a location for flora lovers. I walked around this pretty quickly.

Cloud Mountain was pretty amazing, as soon as you walk in the door you're faced with the massive waterfall. Spend some time just taking that in and get some good photos there, because you won't get a change to come back to that spot after you progress.

You then catch a lift to the top of the mountain and walk down. It's worth going once if you're in the area.

It is very cold in the flower dome and cloud forest so you may want to take a jumper if you're planning on being in there for a while."
,,Interesting and informative,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is much the better of the two conservatories. The first thing you see is an enormous waterfall, before taking a lift to the very top, and walking back down. There are great views of Singapore, the vegetation is amazing, and the films and exhibits on climate change interesting and thought-provoking."
,,"The way it is build, it is amazing",5.0,,"It is a man made construction, full of plants, flowers, lego flowers and amazing views. For me it was nicer than the flower dom."
,,Cooling and spectacular,5.0,,A welcome respite from the heat. Spectacular carvings at every turn. Walk the walks and make sure your camera has plenty of battery power left
,,Nice,5.0,,"What a wonderful way to learn about cloud forests. The architecture, the waterfall and the botanical delights were worth seeing. A lovely place."
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"I loved the Cloud Forest, it was very impressive and a bit challenging when you are at the very top if you are afraid of heights, but totally worth the experience. I loved the giant waterfall."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Only in Singapore would you find this type of experience and to such a standard. They have created the experience of being in a cloud filled landscape typical of a mountainside. As you enter, the atmosphere is heavy with moisture and this applies visually too. The waterfall is spectacular as you enter and from there on in the experience gets better.
You get to the top of the mountain via a lift or escalator and walk down via metal walkways and escalators. The plant life is intriguing with a wide range of varieties."
,,best falls in singapore!!!,5.0,,it is in the Gardens by the Bay.the most amazing place.though it is artificially created but it still looks 100%natural.must watch.
,,Love love love. Like a colony on Mars.,5.0,,"Extraterrestial, hyper futuristic, well worth your money.

Bring a vest or something like that."

,,Indoor waterfall!!,5.0,,So where can you find a huge waterfall indoor?? Cloud forest ofcourse. Cover this with Gardens by the Bay and you will enjoy this
,,Part of Nay Garden complex,5.0,,"The architecture is amazing. If you are interested in tropical plants pay to go in, as an experience for those who haven't been in real tropical areas."

,,Stunning!,5.0,,"I know this is a hand-made attraction, and the nature is within walls, but the dome is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! It is very impressive to see the waterfall and see all the flora around. The space make you feel small, as you would in the forest. Beautiful!"
,,A Must Place in Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"Firstly This is a Second part of Gardens by the Bay .......
Cloud Forest is place where you get the feeling of Green Mountain with all Flowers & Plants with tallest artificial Indoor Waterfall with a breathtaking view....
It is a home of more than 50000 plants from tropical highlands which is above 2000 Meters of Sea level...."
,,AmGarden of Edenazing place do not miss going,5.0,,Just amazing how they have got the plants to such a growth level and how it is laid out. Walking around is so relaxing
,,Take your time,5.0,,What an amazing experience. So peaceful even with all the other people. You take an elevator to the top then make your way down. It is well worth taking time to look not just take photos.
,,Couple,5.0,,"The most amazing gardens, climate, plants, place, people. This what you have to see when you are in Singapur :)"
,,Only in Singapore,5.0,,A greenhouse in a tropical country??? This is a must-see attraction for tourists and locals. The cloud forest is amazing. You will enjoy the cool temperatures and amazing waterfall.
,,Visual delight,5.0,,"Meticulous in design, with nary a square inch unplanted. Cloud Forest was quite literally breathtaking in scope. Oh, and it was cool."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Can't say anything else other thsn amazing. I came here with my 13 yrs and 6 years old and both of them were really enjoyed it.
,,Lovely place to relax and enjoy nature,5.0,,"My boyfriend and I went to the cloud forest dome with our family. Always wanted to go inside the domes ever since Gardens by the Bay was opened but didn't have the opportunity to do so until late last year. Although it wasn't as good as we expected, we still enjoyed ourselves. It is a good activity to do in Singapore, should it rain as it is completely indoors and is air-conditioned.

We absolutely love the waterfall as it is really beautiful. The pathways inside the cloud forest have meshed floors above ground, so this wouldn't be enjoyable to those who are afraid of heights. As a local here, I would definitely recommend people to visit the cloud forest if they're looking for a place to relax and enjoy the scenery in a cool place as Singapore tend to have hot weather."
,,Interesting but?,3.0,,"This is an indoor attraction and not a real cloud forest like we visited in Costa Rica. They have copied many of the things which are found in the cloud forest but no animals, insects, or birds. The whole thing just seems artificial. They have a video playing as you exit that was most likely produced a while ago that has very inaccurate information. It appears to be using evidence produced by Al Gore to promote his now debunked C02 Global Warming Theory. If the global temperature was rising as the film suggests then they would be calling it global warming still. Remember they changed the name to climate change when the temperatures decrease for nearly 20 years in a row following Al Gores predictions based on inadequate science."
,,Absolutely gorgeous,5.0,,Very nice to visit on a hot or rainy day as you are protected in this beautiful bubble. We went at night and the atmosphere was very mystical though I felt we could hardly see the plants on display. But it definitely made us wanna go back for a day time visit
,,Botanical genius,4.0,,Great place to visit iif in Singapore. Situated within Gardens by the Bay this massive greenhouse features a fantastic waterfall and a walkway through fantastic botanical species.
,,a MUST,5.0,,Very beautiful and enchanting!! I don't have any regret coming there in the nick of time. About a few hours before my flight
,,Different rxperience,4.0,,This is a different experience in life. An indoor mountain like garden. Cool indoors for those who feel cold should carry something warm.
,,"Refreshing, interesting and Cool!",5.0,,The Cloud Forest dome was the outstanding experience in Gardens by the Bay. Brilliant of course in Singapore to enter a cool climate that feels like outdoors. Some brilliant blooms and amazing sights. Much better than the neighbouring flower dome when we were there.
,,Worth seeing,5.0,,The structure itself is amazing and the walks on sky bridges were great to see the overall display. Great display of rain forest vegetation.
,,Experience of a life time,5.0,,Very good lifetime experience. I have enjoyed it with the family very much and look forward to come again in future.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"One of the best things to see in Singapore, hands down. No trip should be complete without a visit. Must see!"
,,Ok,3.0,,"I guess there are other nice botanical gardens around. I like the fact, that it is sustainable and no power is wasted here, but the whole attraction just doesn't seem so overwhelming as it could be."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,We loved the cloud forest which simulates cloudy conditions at timed intervals. Huge waterfall and amazing flora with sky walks and many levels to explore.
,,Well maintained site.,5.0,,It is arranged very nicely Start from the top of the world and slowly going down . Cost 28 sgd per adult. The ticket include also the flower garden. Worth to see.
,,Do not miss!,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is fascinating. Love the feeling of being in the clouds and looking sown at all the interesting plants below on the mountain. The kids will love the mist and spray of the waterfall.
,,A man made marvels - Even God 'll wonder!,5.0,,"Been there 2 times (2013 Dec, 2014 Aug). If you have EP (Singapore employee pass) then you 'll have discount on ticket price. Food/Drink is not allowed (As usual in Singapore). Its a must visit if you are in Singapore. I guess this is the unique architecture in entire world."
,,Bring a Jacket,4.0,,"Not sure if the fee was worth it. They had a large variety of plants but we got there at night and lighting wasnt so good.

It had many different types of exhibits and you can allot a good 1-hour for this.

It's pretty cold so bring a jacket."
,,Visit this attraction!,5.0,,"Whatever you're in Singapore for, however short your stay is, no matter how busy you are - visit this flower house! So awesome you won't regret spending your time here!"
,,Interesting concept,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time here, very interesting for the gardening enthusiasts, although I am not, Ii still highly recommend it."
,,Family outings during the Chinese New Year.,4.0,,One of two attractions that need entrance fee at Garden by the Bay (Singapore). Educational and magnificent architecture and design. Worth a visit for both the locals and tourists.
,,Highlight of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"We spent a half day visiting the gardens by the bay, but the highlight for us was the Coud Forest.
As you walk in and out of the mountain you really get a feel for the landscape represented.
The walk is also enhanced by the sculptures scatter throughout the glass house."
,,Good place to go.,5.0,,The waterfall is great. There also lot of plants to see. The skywalk also exciting. Temp is cool also. My kid is very happy. Good place to go.
,,Cool but expensive...,4.0,,"If you have a little wiggle room in your budget, then I recommend visiting here. It's pretty cool - and even has an informative video at the end about global warming and how to save our environment. However, if your money is a bit tight, skip this and just walk around the free parts of Marina Bay Gardens, especially the SuperTree Groves...they're the best part anyway."
,,totally mindblowing and beautiful,5.0,,wear good walking shoes - have over 2 hours to explore. costs $28 to get into both domes but the Gardens by the Bay is free (don't be fooled like we were) still loved the Domes despite the fact we didn't plan to visit them
,,Wow factor at Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"There's something very special about this place. Do this first before Flower Dome (not as impressive).

The refreshing scents and cool air in this place makes a welcome relief to the outside humidity. After an initial lap of the ground floor, the lift takes you to the top of the forest, and the walk back down, past the water falls and stunning flora arrangements. It felt like a jungle experience in the centre of the city.

There are several sculptures on the way round, and some facts and displays on stalagmites and stalactites.

Like every well designed tourist attraction (trap!), the exit runs into the gift shop.

Beautiful, well worth the entry fee."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Yep this is a keeper I will be back. The architecture is interesting, not appealing to me personally, however it's definitely a spectacular venue, I doubt you will be disappointed."
,,So many beautiful plants - I was in heaven !,5.0,,The plants in this dome are beautifully staged. They can be viewed from ground level or from the elevated walk ways
,,Beautiful spot,5.0,,Beautiful spot with beautiful flowers and waterfalls. A little bit cold inside. So take a sweater with you. But.. Do not miss this if you are in Singapore!...
,,worth money spent,5.0,,Excellent experience and worth money spent. You can enjoy every bit of it but keep some time available
,,Great for all ages,5.0,,I visited the cloud forest with my elderly mum and my teenage son and all three of us enjoyed the visit. Once you enter the cloud forest it is hard to believe that you are in a city :) This is definitely a must see attraction in Singapore.
,,Very imaginative,4.0,,"Lovely respite from the hot and humid Singapore air. A beautiful fantasy space that combines the best of vertical and horizontal areas with plants and water. Steps can be slippery for the elderly, but otherwise a great place to spend some time."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"It was very cooling, fully air conditioned. Flowers were all beautiful! Place was extremely clean too. Took a lot of instgram worthy photos, hehe. Best to come with a friend, or on a date!"
,,head in the clouda,5.0,,the plants and engineering combined is wonderful head for heights.would help.from the canopy to the ground from 5 to 100 should see this
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,The artificial environment created here is a perfect way for people to see the diversity of plants which grows in this climatic type. It is colourful and quite spectacular.
,,Interesting,5.0,,Definitely worthy to see. It is impressive that this kind of counstruction was done uder the roof. Looks very nice and I would love to go there once more.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"As with the Gardens by the Bay, this is a spectacular display of plants and fauna across a multiple level structure and well worth the visit. It is cooler inside so if you are not used to cooler temperatures you may want to take a jacket but we found it very refreshing and a lovely retreat from the heat and bustle of Singapore. A must see."
,,Must do,5.0,,Absolutely loved this despite being afraid of heights. It is so beautiful and a great way to keep cool on a warm day! If you are limited for time I'd chose the cloud forest over the flower dome but both are good.
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Never seen anything like this before. Breathtaking views, gorgeous flowers and I felt that I was in a rainforest"
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is an experience like no other. Attention to detail is incredible. Immaculate in its presentation, this is a perfect place for adults and children alike to explore and discover. Remember to take a jacket or light jumper as it does get very cool inside! A must see!"
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"Be awed by the man-made waterfall and the other features that you will experience along the way such as the crystal exhibits and the sky walk! It was my third visit and I still enjoyed the place! It can get a little cold so do bring a jacket along. If you want to get a little closer to the waterfall, be prepared to get a little wet as the spray travels quite a bit!"
,,A living cloud forest and a learning experience,5.0,,"The cloud forest in Marina bay park is amazing. Stepping into a huge shell that houses exotic plants and a large waterfall is a beautiful experience. There are cloud forests that have yet to be fully explored on our planet and many plants and animals yet to be discovered. Sadly, global warming will destroy the cloud forests and they will disappear around 2050. Sad to know after visiting this beautiful spot."
,,A good way to appreciate rainforests,5.0,,"The architecture of the building and the general set up of the area resembles a rainforest. The wide array of plants contained in this dome is a reminder of why we need to save our rainforests. A small fraction of rainforest can hold this much life, what about the vast acres that are being destroyed for land?"
,,Great Heights,5.0,,Although everything looks artificial the place was built marvelously. You wouldn't have to worry about walking because there's an elevator access that will take you straight to the top. There's escalator on every level as well. Don't forget to bring a jacket coz it can be very cold. There's also drinking fountains and toilet! inside the Cloud Forest itself. Really great for elders.
,,Great place in you not English as it's just like home the climate is.,4.0,,"Went in as part of the garden ticket and the weather was just like the uk damp cool and drab, to other people in the world who come from hot climate it must be amazing although I preferred the flower garden. Anyway the set up is amazing and the walk is very interesting and if you don't like the hear then it's a must. Great part of a day visiting the area. The sculptures are also amazing."
,,Quite beautiful,4.0,,One of the places you should visit in Singapore. Singapore really pumps in much money in building and maintaining this place. It's interesting and eye opener especially to locals who can get to witness the different flowers and botanics from different parts of world. Educational place. Nice place to escape singapore's heat and relax with nature too
,,Better than the Flower Dome,3.0,,"We only had the option to buy tickets for both, Cloud forest and Flower dome. The Cloud Forest is definitely better as it is unique. Interesting to see but a bit pricey for what it has to offer. Knowing how it really is now i think i would skip it."
,,My Favourite Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"We absolutely loved this experience and can't say enough about it. Just go, wander and wonder, and enjoy."
,,Garden Heaven!,5.0,,I'm still in awe of this place. If you love nature and if you adore flowers (like me) then this is exactly where you should be! Make sure you wear and bring your sunblock when visiting during daylight! 😁
,,There's a waterfall,5.0,,We took are kids here and it was great. Not only did they get to experience an indoor waterfall but it was educational too. From the top you get great views of both the cloud forest but also the parts of the city.
,,Well worth the price,5.0,,A large part of the gardens are free and this is one of the few attractions at the gardens with a charge. It was incredible and beautiful! There are waterfalls and a beautiful mountain covered in plants. It really transports you to another world. I read something comparing it to the avatar movie and I agree with that statement 100%. It is also a great idea for a rainy day because the cloud forest is covered. It is also eco friendly and has a educational component at the end. Great for family's or really anyone at any age. Also there are elevators.
,,"A MUST PLACE TO SEE, SO DELIGHTFUL",5.0,,"You have to experience this to appreciate how beautiful and lovely it is. We spent about an hour, and it was well worth the time."
,,Unique and beautiful,5.0,,you feel like to entered a cloud with the mist and the cold weather. the waterfall was amazing and the flowers coming out of the dome were beautiful. walk from the 6th floor down and see the view outside the dome. I loved this place. Price was $58 for the two domes flower and cloud forest. A bit steep but well worth it.
,,Best part of Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,"I had expected it to be even more hot and muggy inside the Cloud Forest as it was outdoors,,, but, no! It was a cool and refreshing respite from the tropical weather outside. Definitely recommend you visit it!!!"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Beauty of plants, flowers and clouds. From top you get a good view of the places around. Lovely plants and trees and a wonderful crystal hill at the ground level. Worth the visit"
,,Head in the trees,4.0,,"An engineering and botanical masterpiece. It does have a charge but it is very cheap to go up, about £2.50 at today's exchange rate. Once up you have a great view of the gardens and the surrounding area. We went up during the day but you can go up during the night put to about 8pm."
,,Grand and educational!,4.0,,The cold breeze is a welcome change on a hot Singapore day! The detailed and educational aspect of this place makes it a good option for a family outing!
,,Not your everyday,3.0,,"People, especially avid adventurers like me met get easily unimpressed by the artificial waterfall. But one needs to understand the concept of this Cloud Forest revolves around using a coolhouse to produce the appropriate conditions for the plants."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a spectacular, vegetated dome within the gardens by the bay. We went at night. Even the teenagers were entranced. A very special, peaceful place to visit in the city."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Like all things Singapore this does not disappoint. You truly feel like you are walking through the tree tops of a tropical forest. It is truly a special place and must see on every visit.
,,another nice afternoon activity,5.0,,"Cloud Forest showcases plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000 metres above sea level. It features a 35-meter-tall mountain covered in lush vegetation, shrouding the world’s tallest indoor waterfall."
,,Man Made mountain of excellence,5.0,,"The mountain may be man-made but all,of the vegetation is natural enough. Planted into the steel structure the man-made quality disappears completely and you can really visualise yourself being in a cloud forest high up a cliff side. A very well done layout."
,,Must visit !,4.0,,Absolutely amazing as you ' ll find in front of you a huge waterfall that cools down the temperature and gives the opportunity to many plants to grow in the right ambiance .Green all around it is amazing the walk on top you can do and feel really in the clouds ...Kids would love it !
,,Do get the concept,2.0,,Nothing much to appreciate here other than the man made waterfall and the plants. Plus some other extra figurine and exhibit to catch your attention. Works best for the city folks. Don't really have the WOW factor.
,,Very Impressive,5.0,,This attraction was closed on the day we planned to visit and so we had to return the next day and were so glad that we did. The mist is created by millions of jets and the show happens every 2 hours so make sure that you time your visit accordingly. Would highly recommend.
,,Best part of the gardens!,5.0,,Don't even question it. Just do this. It was sooooooo very cool. Daunting heights. Amazing views. Haven't seen anything like this anywhere else.
,,High above the clouds,4.0,,"This location features an indoor man-made waterfall, with a very cooling atmosphere. It features a climb to the top and back down, with many exhibits and views on geographic formations."
,,An Awesome World in a Mist!,4.0,,"Very nice mountain-views surrounded by vegetation and flowers! A lot of rare plants as well on their ""natural"" environment."
,,Indescribable,5.0,,"Adjacent to the Flower Dome, this venue houses a seven storey tall mini-mountain ecosystem. Upon entering the dome you are met by the roar of the waterfall, which also serves to cool down the ambient temperature. You then take the meandering path around the base of the mountain before hopping on the elevator to the 6th storey. A staircase awaits which leads to the highest reaches of the mountain. Here, a beautiful water feature abounds with plantlife. From this serene place you make your way down the winding walkways which are set in positions that allow you to view the ecosystem from multiple perspectives. Excellent views abound of the external features of Gardens by the Bay, such as the Supertrees and the Flower Dome. Other prominent sights can also be seen from various points as you make your way to the bottom of the mountain. Upon reaching the bottom you can also watch the featured exhibits about climate change & how ecosystems function. An exhibit about crystal formation is able to be viewed on your walk to the bottom too. You finish your journey in the gift shop. Highly recommended."
,,Lovely place to visit.,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay is the Cloud Forest, which was a huge glass building for cool ,moist plants. It was a very pleasant temperature after the heat outside, and I needed to wear my jumper.
There is a huge plant covered hill at the centre of the dome, and the highest artificial waterfall cascades down from the top.At summit there is a black reflecting pool, with islands of orchids and bromeliads. We sat and drank in the beauty of the surroundings.
Just when we thought it couldn’t get any better, the cloud mist started spraying, and a gentle mist drifted across the pool.
Allow at least an hour to enjoy this wonderful place."
,,Awesome,5.0,,The place is overwhelming! Plants and trees of different species abound. Plants one has never seen before are there. Beautiful!
,,Lot to Do & See Worth Time Spending and Unlimited Fun,5.0,,"There are virtually unlimited things one can do here. Sit peaceful in open spaces and admire from nature, see wild animals, running, camping, eat at amazing food points, biking take astonishing pictures , enjoy beautiful & peaceful surroundings and achieve a new level of inner peace"
,,Great Indoor Garden,4.0,,A huge garden with a variety of plants in a controlled environment. Great for nature lovers. Could'nt see the clouds -we were short of time
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,"This is a huge dome containing a huge mountain covered in vegetation with a waterfall cascading from the top. There is a walkway from the bottom to the top passing lots of interesting plants, carvings,etc. There is also a lift if you feel lazy and only want to waslk one way!"
,,Cloud Foresty is a Great place to spend some hours during Singpore visit. Both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are ama,5.0,,Gardens By The Bay is a Great place to spend some hours during Singapore visit. Cloud Forest Dome is an amazing (with cool air conditioning) place to visit on a hot day in Singapore.
,,a great diversion on a hot day,5.0,,"this is probably the only place in singapore i found that is actually cold! but more than that, this dome was interesting to me both from an architecture/engineering perspective, and for the plants and flowers contained. totally worth the ten bucks."
,,why today?,1.0,,"Cloud Forest close for maintenance today without notice before! I visit the official website and don't see any notice about time to maintenance. By the way, tomorrow Flower Dome will close for maintenance too. It's too bad to be here."
,,Interesting Structure,3.0,,The Gardens by the Bay is an interesting area and worth a walk through and the Cloud Forest is interesting but not that special
,,Unusual botanical garden experience,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is a short walk from the Supertrees. There are two climate controlled bio-domes, which keeps a range of plants from all over the world. One dome is the Flower Dome and the other one, the Cloud Forest. It’s an artificial mountain reported to be 35 meters high, inside the dome that replicates the cool, moist conditions on top of tropical mountains between 3,300 to 9,800ft above sea level.

There is an artificial waterfall at the entrance. An elevator takes you to the top level of this indoor mountain, after which you come down circling the mountain through huge skyways.

As you come down, which is called Cloud Walk, you get a very close view of various epiphytes plant species that clad the side of the mountain.

Halfway down, the Crystal Mountain Cave showcases many interesting shapes of real stalactites and stalagmites. It provides an insight into how the continents formed, the age of earth, and the importance of fossils, after which you're taken through the video presentation room, which demonstrates the effect that a 5° C increase in temperature due to climate change is expected to have on mountain-top environments like these.

The Tree Top Walk which is at the bottom of the mountain takes you close to the forest canopy for a spectacular bird’s eye view of the treetops.

Cloud Forest is open daily from 9.00am - 9.00pm and tickets are SG$28, including access to the Flower Dome as well.

The Cloud Walk is a unique opportunity to experience the flora of such varied regions and it’s an unusual botanical garden experience."
,,Cloud Forest - The Perfect Name,5.0,,Very unique... especially when it's misting time a real sense of being in the forest. Great way to view some of the species up close.
,,High up,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is one of the spectacularly fitted domes at Gardens by the Bay with this acclimatized to that of a rainforest just about. It is quite cool when you first enter, strikingly different to the humid Singapore air. The is a huge man made ',mountain, with lift access and a gradual return walk to the floor. A waterfall with a big drop is a highlight that fills the dome with a light, refreshing mist. The plants display is immaculate with many orchids and carnivorous plants a feature. Once at the top of the mountain, you are very high up from where you started and get a great outlook of the whole place."
,,Really cool and interesting,5.0,,"The Cloud forest was a nice surprise, did not think I would enjoy it as much. Plus it is great when you want to escape the heat. One could spend hours in there just looking and learning as you make your way through this interesting and lovely attraction.

I would recommend going in the morning as it seems all the school kids go in the afternoon and can get a bit chaotic."
,,Fun place,5.0,,This is yet another good place for a stroll in the Gardens by the Bay. The best part is the waterfall at the beginning and the top floor when you're walking along the sky path
,,Take your time!,5.0,,Allow time to learn about the cloud ecosystem and to look at the huge variety of plants growing at all levels. A very well designed facility.
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,Very impressed with all that is in the dome particularly the Waterfall and Walkways .Superb design that gives you access to all the plants
,,A walk in the clouds,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is more interesting and educational, this one is more like entertainment for children (and children at heart)."
,,Fantastic attraction for absolutely everyone,5.0,,"Breathtaking cloud walk with raised and suspended walkway, a man-made waterfall right at the entrance, a bouquet of exotic-for-these-parts flora of mountainous and semi-arid regions & a whole Lego-garden make Cloud Forest the most unusual botanical garden experience."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,This dome is one of the best in Gardens by the Bay. The view is simply mesmerizing. You will feel like walking in the clouds. The two walkways goes around the waterfall on top and slowly leads the way down.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"The cloud forest is nice to walk around, but it really isn't much more than a giant waterfall. Could visit gardens by the bay and just enjoy the free gardens and supertrees without doing this. It did look nice lit up at night (you can get a stamp to return same day)."
,,Fantastic array of plants and flowers!,5.0,,Make sure you take a jacket or cardigan with you as it is cold inside here! We loved the walk and heaps of great photos along the way..any plant lover needs to do this for sure!
,,Love the environment,5.0,,the waterfall was so huge and the bridge was so high up but worth walking all the way up to the top to appreciate the view
,,The Best Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was my favorite part of the Gardens at the Bay. Immediately as you walk into the conservatory, a light mist tickles your face and you smell the earthy scent of wet earth. The mist is coming from the world's tallest indoor waterfall cascading from the side of a mountain that doubles as a six story hanging garden. . . that you can climb. Each level that you travel up gives you a new perspective with secret views from inside it's core."
,,Cool forest,4.0,,Cloud forest consist of plant grow at rain forest. Waterfall and tree top walk make this place is amazing. Enjoy this place and make your soul refreshed
,,My 2nd time at the Cloud Forest,5.0,,An amazing feat of engineering AND gardening. Multi level walkway with amazing plants everywhere you look. Fun way to spend an hour or two or many more if you explore everything that Gardens by the Bay has to offer.
,,Best dome,5.0,,The one to see if have limited time. Walk high into the sky around a man made mountain of plants growing at various hights. Cool so may want a sweater
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Very good. The mist show was very nice. The falls at the entrance is amazing. The heights were scary initially, but managed to complete it successfully."
,,unique experience,5.0,,it is very interesting rain forest with so many things to learn about ecosystem and our planet. we had impression to be in real mountain rain forest.
,,Mmmmmm.......okay,3.0,,Not as impressive as its sister the Flower Dome but still worth seeing. We were there at dusk as the lights come on and that certainly changes the ambience - then wandered over to the Supertree Grove night performance - would recommend doing that - both in conjunction..
,,Neat concept but not mature enough yet,3.0,,"It was neat to see the large manmade waterfall and walk around the dome, but aside from that, there was not really much to see. I think it will be an extremely cool place in 10 or 20 years time when the cloud forest matures, but right now, it's just as interesting as the free gardens outside."
,,a most unique experience,5.0,,"There are circular walkways from the ground level that wind themselves around a rain forest, jungle. Artificial mists, waterfalls, a bouquet of plant life from all over the world. The most unusual botanic experience of our lives."
,,Fascinating Place.,5.0,,"So much to see in here, you have to take your time going round. We started at the top and worked our way down. I loved the wood carvings scattered around in between the plants."
,,It's like your in a different fantasy world,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest reminds you of gorillas in the mist as mist shoots out to keep the plants moist like in the jungle, beautiful exotic plants and flowers everywhere you look. Huge waterfall and walkways for you to observe follage from every angle. Very surreal feeling, Statues made from plants, wooden carvings, a whole carnivorous plant garden made from Lego, complete with hanging red-back spider. Just plain beautiful. Film shown at end of walk describing the effects of global-warming in years to come bought tears to my eye's, it was well done. Singapore is definitely trying to do their part in being ecologically minded."
,,Amazing Waterfall,5.0,,"It was an exquisite view with an amazing waterfall once you pass the entrance door, the landscape are also extravagant. You can walk from the highest level (7F) and then take a walk along the sky bridge to go down until 3F"
,,Simply fantastic!,5.0,,"Take your time with this one because it just gets better with every turn. The walkway overhead is fabulous and the cool - feels very cold, in fact - by comparison, temperatures inside is a welcome change to the tropical humidity of the outdoors."
,,Interesting Concept,5.0,,"sustainable energy garden, great, architecture, steels combination with glass and technology. be prepared, because it is around 18-21 degrees celcius inside, although it is 28 degrees outside.. love it.."
,,Nice water fall made by human,5.0,,"One you come, you thinking you are at the real forest. So high and so beautiful, with a lot of trees,flowers from tropical forest , some time you thick you are at Amazon forest with wooden crocodile. There inside Garden By the Bay."
,,The Misty Escapade,5.0,,"The cloud forest with its fascinating blend of flora from the tropics to the mountains, is a thoughtful reminder to save planet Earth in its pristine form. A multiple entry pass to the various attractions at the Gardens by the Bay would be a smart option."
,,Don't know why it's called cloud forest.,4.0,,So refreshingly cool in here. Save this venue for when you are really hot and bothered. Bring a drink and just relax and enjoy the plants and cool cool air!
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is well worth a visit - it is located centrally in Gardens by the Bay.

Beware that there is an entry fee to visit Cloud Forest - and Singapore has introduced multiple pricing policies - for locals and tourists - the entry fee is for locals $SG12 adult/$Sg8 Senior and a flat $SG 16 for tourists - the brochure and pricing a the entry is confusing - do not get confused.

Cloud Forest has a huge array of plant life - when you go in by the falls make your way to the top and walk from the top down - you will not be disappointed. Try and be there when ""misting "" occurs we were there for the 12 00 misting"
,,Easy to move for disabled,5.0,,"Very well organize, easy to move for everyone. remember to take a jacket as one of the dome the climate goes down until 12 degree."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"As soon as you enter the cloud forest you are welcomed by amazing view of the waterfall,who ever designed this needs to get an award it is one of the most relaxing walks i have taken round the forest, great views and photo opportunities are endless, only downside quite pricy to enter but worth it."
,,MUST NOT MISS,5.0,,What an experience. this is simply fantastic along with Flower Dome. EXCEPT take your own food and water. A cuppa in the flower garden was simply out of our price range!! Do not miss this attraction
,,A must. Simply stunning.,5.0,,"Right from the very beginning with the stunning waterfall and the Lego plants, we knew this was going to be good. Great for all the family, there's loads to learn and to do, plus there are plenty of lifts and escalators so it's accessible for anyone. A highlight of our entire stay."
,,Great experince!,4.0,,Take a moment and just enjoy the beauty of this place. Walk around and feel the fresh air and it will make you think twice why we mess up mother nature.
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,Magnificent display of tropical plants in a rainforest setting with a misty and wet atmosphere which is refreshingly cool. Lots of see and learn about rainforest environments. The forest has a raised and suspended walkway with easy walking to get to the top. Lots of educational displays also. Breathtaking views of Marina Bay from the top.
,,the Majestic falls,5.0,,"once you enter the cloud forest, just after the entrance, you will be welcomed by the splash of this majestic water falls, which seems like telling you to go inside and discover the wonders inside this forest"
,,AWESOME,5.0,,Words can not say what I thought of it. Totally loved it the grandkids loved it .Bit of walking but you go at your own pace. Ten out of ten
,,"relaxing, cool and beautiful place",5.0,,"We really enjoyed a cooling and leisurely stroll through the Flower Dome and immerse in a world of perpetual spring. The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. Here, you'll discover not only the amazing beauty of these plants and flowers, but how they have also adapted to the cool-dry environments. This is within the Gardens by the Bay and it is a very relaxing, cool and beautiful place, Easy to lose a day here .If you like plants, flowers , architecture, or striking views or remarkable buildings or unusual layout of parks then this is the place for you It is a must when in Singapore."
,,Natural way to spend a few hours,4.0,,Spectacular entrance with the waterfall greeting you together with an instant cool change. Spectacular cloud walk with raised and suspended walkway and great insight into regional flora and even geology
,,The best man-made indoor garden,4.0,,"I think this is the best man made indoor garden I've ever visited. At first I don't put much hope to this dome as the flower dome is nice and besutiful but not wonderful. But this place is awesome. Very good and complete. If you have limited time and have to choose between one of the dome, pick this up and you won't regret it."
,,Lovely Walk in Cloud Forest,5.0,,Cloud Forest is no doubt a masterpiece created inside a Gigantic Glass Dome. Its entrance has a spectacular waterfall which immediately made us so relaxed .The forest has a wide variety of plants and flowers and its designing and architecture are no doubt spectacular. From the top floor one can have a great view of lovely Marina Bay.We liked the different kind of flowers specially at top floor.The pathways are designed in such a beautiful manner that one feels like standing in a new green planet. Must visit place and its cold inside so its better to be in warmer clothes.
,,Best day ever!,5.0,,We all loved this (kids 9-15) I would thoroughly recommend. It's out of this world and jawdroppingly beautiful. It's nice and cool in there too if you're feeling overwhelmed by the heat of Singapore.
,,Loved this,5.0,,Really good for an afternoons fun. Very impressive. A lot of walking so not great for people with mobility limitations- the best bit is walking up to the bridge and walking down through the rain forest so not sure it's suitable for everyone.
,,Tourist trap,3.0,,Pleasent enough structure with very tall waterfall and quite interesting planting. OK for limited mobility as lifts available. Took me an hour. The gardens are free and much
,,OK place -- mostly from children -- but not worth it,2.0,,"The best part in this man made forest is the garden partly made out of legos -- that was a nice touch. But besides that you see some flowers, trees and waterfalls that were built for this place. So what? I don't understand reviews here on TA going on and on about this place. You want to see something an impressive waterfall -- try see it in nature. For kids, I guess this could be semi-fun, and it's an opportunity to chill from the hot and rainy weather. Overall overpriced for what you get. You want to see flowers -- go to National Orchid Garden -- a third of the price and at least you get to see much more flowers and trees."
,,Our favourite spot,5.0,,Cloud forest is our favorite spot. Start from the top floor buy taking the lift and then explore the other areas by going down. The waterfall is nice and the cloud walk is magnificent. It was sort of embarrasing when I couldn't walk fast (wast kinda scared) when my 5 year old girl was so excited she just could not stop running. :)
,,like a real forest,5.0,,There is 6-7 floors in this dome and it makes me feeling like walking in the forest with foggy rain.
,,Excellent family attraction,5.0,,It's a huge climate controlled dome of sorts with a simulated mountain rain forest environment exhibiting an enormous range of attractive plants. There are a series of cat walks providing different views of the environment and different altitudes and a couple of other exhibits incorporated. The plants themselves are spectacular as is the overall architecture of this clean and well run exhibit suitable for the whole family.
,,Great Place,4.0,,"Great choice but would suggest that you do not include the gardens. Lots to look at, great water fall feature too."
,,See the way it was design,2.0,,The building is better than the exhibits and worth seeing for about an hour. Nothing spectacular . Come in the evening to enjoy the light show instead.
,,Cold but nice,4.0,,A lil too chilly but then again what do you expect being in the 'clouds'. Pretty interesting and it has a number of insta-worthy snap spots.
,,Must see along with garden by the bay,5.0,,"We was here around 7 pm at night. Have been to many house garden in Paris, New York but this one left me a strongest impression. Walking around the sky bridge made you feel you are in a Ancient type Hollywood movie. Didnt get a chance to see the park when the sun is up, But with light and fog effects, we was really satisfied . Highly recommended you to visit Cloud Forest, another dorm if you are and have some money to spare go for it, we are not too impressed with it and only spend 20 mins in there."
,,Engineering marvel,5.0,,Loved there gardens they are very interesting and informative with the walk in the cloud walkway way up in the dome.
,,Best I have seen in Singapore,5.0,,"I had no expectations when entering this dome but instantly wowed by the over 200 metre indoor waterfall. This manmade mountain simulates what you can see and feel at certain altitudes and is very informative about the kind of vegetation, stalactites and animals that live in such an environment.

I enjoyed best of all the cloud walk. The walkway created around the mountain is so comfortable that even one with fear of heights can appreciate the scenario. It is by far the best indoor nature conservatory I have seen in Asia."
,,Beautiful but dirtier glass,4.0,,The flowers were expanding in species counts. But the number or orchids was declining a lot. The waterfall was magnificent. The walk was also breathtaking. Sadly the glasses on the dome was not really clean.
,,It was nice,4.0,,The view was really nice. Definitely have to give them A+ for the effort and work put in there. The display and environmental movie was nice. One only downside is that they should have warned people that going down to the movie area + secret garden means no way back.
,,"Interesting, particularly the time in which this was ""created""",4.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay and you have to pay a fee to see it. I'm glad we saw this first, because personally, I think the Flower Dome was even better. The most impressive feature is the walk in the ""cloud"", and seeing all the flowers growing on the concrete base on which this ""forest"" has been grown. The one thing I disliked? The stalagmites and stalactites on display. I wonder where they were taken from and how ""naked"" that original cave must look now. The work of mother nature of thousands of years, destroyed for a display elsewhere."
,,A freezing but exhilarating experience,4.0,,"The place was freezing, but I loved how everything - the mist, the bridges, the plants, all came together cohesively to make this an ethereal experience that transported you to a temperate climate. It's also a great place to bring your kids should you wish to educate them about the environment and its plants."
,,A Singapore must see,5.0,,"Take your time & experience this wondrous botanical place-cool, scenic, & very well planned. Loved all the walk through areas & all the wonderfully descriptive plaques."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,A wonderful experience and replicates the real world clod forests well. The walkways are safe and secure and the different layers of vegetation are wonderful. You can easily spend an hour or more in this part of the Gardens by the Bay
,,higly recommended....,5.0,,"This is a part of Gardens by the bay, this is a man made wonder one cannot miss, it'll be like a dream land, you'll be taken to a fantasy world. it'll take min 2 hrs. you cannot effort to miss this in Singapore."
,,Amazing Creation,5.0,,"Its simply magnificent. The waterfall, the walk around through the forest is a very unique experience."
,,So Impressive,5.0,,"An indoor, climate controlled replica of the cloud forests of Malaysia; this is a perfect way to spend a day. Singapore is hot, all year round, and not only is this attraction cool, but its sustainable. Its educational for everyone."

,,Really Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"I really enjoyed wandering through here, there were so many flowers out in diffetent colours. The plants were all really healthy and the air is so cool and freash."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,What an awesome place! The indoor waterfall is beautiful. The only thing I would caution someone on is if they are afraid of heights the multi-level air bridges might be a bit of a challenge :)
,,Nice but expensive,4.0,,"It's a nice concept but for the price only worth visiting once. I like the whole area of gardens by the bay for taking walks or riding bicycle. Since the other areas are not ticketed it is nice. For the price and if there is lack of time, I would recommend tourists to even skip it."
,,if you only have time for 1 see this,5.0,,I'm no gardening guru but this place is a sight not to be missed. This trip we had more time and took in most of the gardens - one night and back the next morning. Of all the locations in this complex don's miss this one
,,Highlight of our trip Magical inside,5.0,,"A great couple of hours spent here, very cool inside as well. The cold wet environment is fantastic to escape the heat of Singapore, and it is magical so you slowly walk a gradual accent into the cloud of the dome."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Was fantastic. A little expensive to get into but you could spend a lot of time looking at all the flowers. We really enjoyed it!
,,Simply Amazing,5.0,,"If you visit the Gardens by the Bay be sure to pay for entry to both conservatories, including the Cloud Forest. It is a real 'wow' experience, in my opinion."
,,Favorite part of the Gardens by the Bay!!,5.0,,"My husband and I loved walking through the Cloud Forest! The enormous indoor display was very impressive and lent itself to fun pictures. It was less crowded then the Flower Dome, and had just as many live plants. We particularly enjoyed walking through the structure and looking down on the waterfall. Highly recommended!"
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,Amazing place to visit. Highly recommend it. If it's a very hot or rainy day there is so much to see here. And it's cool inside.
,,Cool and Cold,4.0,,"Pros :
+ Its still awesome even for the 2nd visit
+ kids are thrilled to see the waterfall.
+ plenty of awesome photo location
+ easy access for stroller / wheelchair.

Cons :
+ a bit pricey compared to other ""typical"" gardens, then again the maintainance and construction cost of this venue is probably very high too

Traveller Tips : for people used to hotter climate, might be better to bring along sweater/jacket, because it's rather cold inside, especially the Cloud Forrest"
,,Amazing Cloud Forest,5.0,,On entering the cool of Cloud Forest you ride the elevator to the top of the mountain and then take the spiraling walkway back down under and past the waterfall and extensive plantings all the while with stunning vistas of Singapore Bay out through the dome of the
,,"Very nice conservation, educative and relaxing attraction",4.0,,"I like the place. I really appreciate the hard and artistic work creating a conversation which really similar to the original nature. When you are in it, you really can feel the fresh air, the wind breeze and when you get your self close to the water fall you will feel amazing.
The skywalk is very interesting. For you who afraid of height you really need to becareful anyway it is good to pushed your self a bit and enjoy the magical scenery of the place. The plantation consist of hundreds or maybe thousand type, the orchids are amazing, truly beautiful.

I really enjoy my time here"
,,Just experience this!,5.0,,Wonderful. Follow the signs to the lift ( not to the left - that just takes you on a longer route). Start at the top and work your way down - the views and plants are stunning. The walkway is high but worth overcoming any phobias. Probably the best bit of the park.
,,Industrial interpretation of a mountain,5.0,,"So in singapore there is not enough natural beauty so they built a waterfall. But it's an industrial interpretation and they make no pretense of that fact. So it's a very different sort of look. First, we enter and we see a waterfall and it's so intense that one can feel the spray. After that that we take a lift to the sixth floor. We climbed one flight of stairs and it's a beautiful artificial pond with a perfect reflection of these carnivorous plants. Then we take the easy stroll ""down"" the mountain through what is suppose to be a cloud walk! As we walk down we can see these industrial look down the mountain.
There are educational experiences - stagmights &staglites. As we process down there are these educational videos on global warming. The projection till 2100 is very scary. Throughout the walk there are all these beautiful carvings from natural wood - but one had to pay attention and take notice."
,,A perfect place,5.0,,"A beautiful eden, leading the way for future generations... art coupled with education, amazing eco architecture."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Wonderful place to visit. If you love plants, flora, and flowers you could spend hours here. You want to try to go when there are less people to enjoy the serenity."
,,Love the environment,5.0,,This being part of the Gardens by the Bay goes in with the same review. Great place of educational for forest and how Singapore is doing the most to help the world.
,,"Cool waterfalls, mirrors, educational zone, and plantlife",5.0,,"Allocate more time for this dome even though it seems smaller as there is more to take interest in, with the waterfalls, flora and interesting nooks and crannies. It has a lovely view at sunset and you can spy the gardens outside and the marina barrage from the elevated walkway.
If you are a photography fan, could easily spend 3 hours in this dome alone."
,,A place to visit,5.0,,"The entrance fee is well worth the money, a truly spectacular dome showing the best of the high tropics. The atmosphere was a cool chane from the warm Singapore weather. There are lifts to take you up to the top to enable you to walk down the long walkway or for the less able there is a lift to the ground again. The watrrfall is spectacular."
,,Interesting cool respite in Singapore,4.0,,I took my family of 5 to Cloud forest in January. It really is interesting how they have managed to create this cloudy sanctuary in the dome. Highly recommend this to travellers through Singapore.
,,Amazing Cloud Forest,5.0,,On entering the cool of Cloud Forest you ride the elevator to the top of the mountain and then take the spiraling walkway back down under and past the waterfall and extensive plantings all the while with stunning vistas of Singapore Bay out through the dome of the
,,"Very nice conservation, educative and relaxing attraction",4.0,,"I like the place. I really appreciate the hard and artistic work creating a conversation which really similar to the original nature. When you are in it, you really can feel the fresh air, the wind breeze and when you get your self close to the water fall you will feel amazing.
The skywalk is very interesting. For you who afraid of height you really need to becareful anyway it is good to pushed your self a bit and enjoy the magical scenery of the place. The plantation consist of hundreds or maybe thousand type, the orchids are amazing, truly beautiful.

I really enjoy my time here"
,,Just experience this!,5.0,,Wonderful. Follow the signs to the lift ( not to the left - that just takes you on a longer route). Start at the top and work your way down - the views and plants are stunning. The walkway is high but worth overcoming any phobias. Probably the best bit of the park.
,,Industrial interpretation of a mountain,5.0,,"So in singapore there is not enough natural beauty so they built a waterfall. But it's an industrial interpretation and they make no pretense of that fact. So it's a very different sort of look. First, we enter and we see a waterfall and it's so intense that one can feel the spray. After that that we take a lift to the sixth floor. We climbed one flight of stairs and it's a beautiful artificial pond with a perfect reflection of these carnivorous plants. Then we take the easy stroll ""down"" the mountain through what is suppose to be a cloud walk! As we walk down we can see these industrial look down the mountain.

,,Fascinating engineering work,5.0,,"Nice, cool temperatures in here when it is hot outside. Interesting way of explaining the flora and fauna in tropical mountains - and the entire thing is even environmentally friendly!"
,,A must visit for nature lovers,5.0,,It accommodates a water fall indoors. The flowers and vegetation were just marvelous. I just ran out of battery clicking the photos in my camera. It's bit cold inside. Every nature lover will appreciate the effort behind this man made creation to mimic natural cloud forest which takes 200-300 years to form naturally.
,,Amazing indoor waterfall!,5.0,,"Nice, cool misty air surrounds you in this indoor greenhouse. huge waterfall and tower of vegetation in the middle which simulates a visit to a rainforest."
,,Amazing Experience,4.0,,Thumbs up to the team of people behind this idea. Indoor waterfalls? They have it! I will never forget this place.
,,Incredible!,5.0,,"We came here last night at around 8pm and caught a shuttle bus ($4 pp) so the we could optimise the 1hr left in opening hours. The Cloud Forest is an incredible man-made forest that is bug and animal free. The man made waterfall is the highlight, which you see upon entry, but the cloud walk is beautiful and really well done. I've never been to anything like it and it's truly a unique experience! Keep you eye out for the Lego carnivorous plant installation!"
,,Nice place,4.0,,Very nice place. Nice view. Very green. Interesting place. Nice for families. Good atmosphere. Good view at the top. Peaceful
,,Architectural Masterpiece + Good Rainy Day Place to Visit.,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed visiting this attraction. Simply amazing that this could be designed and built as well as it was. Liked it a lot more than Gardens by the Sea so if you have a choice, see this one if you can only go to one."
,,View from the top,4.0,,This gives you a feeling of view from a mountain top / rainforest experience.. cool and greeny place for a relaxed afternoon
,,Wonderful,5.0,,As part of the gardens scene in Singapore this is a well laid out and informative trip. A its warm and moist and offers a great insight into the different tyoe of plants that live in this ecosystem
,,Worth it,4.0,,Botanical garden inside the glass dome is well maintained and has beautiful flowers. The cloud with waterfall was interesting had ramp and lift easy to walk around. The children loved it we were four adults with six kids(10years - 21 years) . Worth the visit.
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,Lovely the light show here - stunning and so beautiful and the night light show all free. Worth it for children and adults.
,,Pretty impressive,3.0,,"The structure itself is very beautiful and there are great gardens, waterfalls, and walkways. Between the two domes I would recommend going only to this one, the other isn't as good."
,,Incredible,5.0,,Ticket covers re entry. My 3 year old went free and probably enjoyed it the most. Addiquate lifts for push chairs. I went back at night. Look spectacular both day and night. Nice rest bite from the heat of the outdoors. Well thought out and amazing walk ways and views from inside waterfall and out.
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,"I really enjoyed this place. The trees, plants and the waterfall was arranged so nicely that, it gave me a complete satisfaction of experiencing the forest."
,,Gorgeous flowers is a unique setting,5.0,,"Located inside a glass dome, this botanical garden has amazing flowers. The set up inside allows for one way walking traffic, and is accessible to handicap or strollers. The platforms wind high up the dome allowing spectacular views of flowers and the waterfall. It is a peaceful experience and should not be missed."
,,Waterfall is interesting,4.0,,"The waterfall and the flowers in the dome were interesting, since the rain cloud waters the plants as in a real rain forest."
,,Worth the admission price and more,5.0,,"I can't understand a recent reviewer complaining the venue was cold. Are they serious? Any relief from the heat is appreciated here.
We found the dome to be fantastic, and worth going to alone if you don't have time to view the whole precinct. Take your time to appreciate the subtle changes to the vegetation as you move up into the clouds. And make sure you time your walk through, for when the 'misting' occurs."
,,a trip to the heavens,5.0,,"This building was stunning, to walk around the it to the summit on the suspended walkway among the beautiful greenery. The indoor waterfall was amazing"
,,Loved everything,5.0,,Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy. A lot of people sped past the waterfall with out seeing some exquisite specimens. Something of interest at every turn. A must for any enthusiastic photographer or gardeners. Good views through the dome of Singapore skyline.
,,Fantastic Visit,5.0,,Never seen anything like this before. We weren't sure what to expect but were blown away. Make sure you see this in Singapore.
,,Fascinating experience in the middle of Singapore,5.0,,"This dome is fully air conditioned to emulate a rainforest environment. There is a huge impressive waterfall, and beautiful gardens to look at. The day we were there they featured pitcher plants, including many made from Lego."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Stunning display of tropical plants and orchids and a wonderful waterfall. Loved the walkway and views from above. A perfect place to take lots of photographs.
,,not worth the visit,2.0,,I was not impressed. It is freezing cold inside so I would suggest to take a sweater with you. Maybe others see it differently but it was horribly boring and I did not see or learn anything new.
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,This is the most amazing place to see. The plants and trees are beautiful. So many varieties of plants and trees. I was amazed to see so many plants from Australia that ca be grown in different parts of the word.
,,Really fun,4.0,,"This attraction is inside Garden's by the Bay and is one of the two dome's. You start with a waterfall and then have 6 stories of plants, tree, ponds and much more."
,,Great view,5.0,,This is a good place for outing with family. Kids will love this place and the concept is quite novel.
,,Pleasing Spot,4.0,,"Singapore is excellent at creating artificial attractions and managing nature. This artificial ""mountain"" has a waterfall and a stairway taking one to the top. The ""mountain"" is greened with a variety of tropical plants. While it is an interesting attraction, it was a bit too reminiscent of a Disneyland attraction for me. Nonetheless. they did display some dramatic orchids, which I am a sucker for."
,,Magical!!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a man-made mountain inside a dome that is cool and moist. A very tall waterfall spraying mist greets you at the entrance.

Take the elevator to the top and walk across skyways to different floor levels and view spectacular plants in a variety of garden settings and the surrounding outer area. Many plants are embedded in exquisite wood carvings.

The Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Supertree Grove are clearly visible from the dome.

Halfway down the mountain, stalactites, stalagmites and crystals are featured in the mountain cave. In the video room ones attention is switched to the effects of climate change on the environment.

Cloud forest is well worth the price of the ticket!!"
,,Wonderful experience !!!,5.0,,This is within the Gardens By The Bay and it is a very cool and beautiful place. It is a must when in Singapore.
,,Got to go,5.0,,"You have to visit this place. Its magical. From the wood crafted pieces to the water fall to the little educational movie at the end on the environment. You will want that pass out to revisit.

You will love it.. Its well maintained , great views of the singapore flyer and the gardens lovely walk from top to bottom.. Remember to look out for the wood carvings.

With a trip..."
,,Pretty place,4.0,,"This is a unique place with lots of plants, flowers and wood carvings. Each ""level"" has a small display and then a walkway where the same things are viewed from a different angle. It was ok, air conditioning a definite plus. Pricey for what it was in our opinion."
,,Beautiful and perfect for people who need aircon!,5.0,,Loved that place because i could see some nature without walking in the Singapore Humid Heat! The whole place is fully airconditioned which made it very pleasant to walk around. I really loved the waterfall!
,,Tallest indoor waterfall,4.0,,"It portrays plant life at about 2,000 metres above sea level. The best way to experience the Cloud Forest is to take the lift up to the top floor, from there slowly through the walkway to enjoy the environment."
,,Awesome Experience,4.0,,Loved It !!!! A new and different experience for me. Loved the concept and the way it has been executed. Would recommend to visit during evening time.
,,Have a Lot tO see,4.0,,"My Boys are so excited tO see this. Because hE already learn at school. So, hE has so many question about everything inside IT."
,,amazing cool and inviting,1.0,,"this is amazing and was not what I was expecting at all, green and cool and so well thought out...we loved it"
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,A fabulous place to spend some quiet time with nature. Gorgeous flowers- including orchids and heaps of beautiful tropical plants. Calm and relaxing.
,,You feel in a real cloud forest,5.0,,"Part of the gardens by the bay, the cloud forest is well worth a visit difficult to believe these gardens are relatively new."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I felt I was in the jungle, deep in the amazon... Loved it. Its so impressive and beautifully made. Took thousands of pictures there. Ideal for a rainy day."
,,Amazing tropical flora !,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is an absolute must to see when in Singapore as it is so unique the way that it has been arranged.
,,Scary if you don't like heights!,5.0,,"This is a very interesting attraction, within the Gardens By The Bay. Price was SIN$58 for a family of 4 which I thought was very reasonable. Everything is contained within a climate controlled dome so it's a refreshing cooldown from outside. The waterfall is beautful. Walking around the pathways at the top is a little unerving if you are scary of heights, but it's very very safe. Just don't look down!"
,,Impressed,4.0,,"So well done, great walk around the dome, $28 for both domes, well worth a visit. So much to look at"
,,The cool place!,5.0,,"In this hot n humid busy city, looking for some nature in a cool (certainly cold) place? You have just found it ! Cloud forest in gardens by the bay is a indoor garden with a artificial waterfall. Amazing view of the Singapore's cityscape including marina bay sands.... You should tryout the walking nature trail thingy there. It's a quite and beautiful space"
,,A Nice Walk,4.0,,"Once again nature lovers, this should be your thing. It is better to buy tickets for the other venue (Gardens By The Bay) too. Both are linked. If one decides to return back to have another view, there is an attendant who will put a 'stamp' on your and you can spend the whole day back and forth."
,,A very unique concept of a garden,5.0,,"Pros:
- Perfect if its raining or very hot outside
- the cloud forest has a very interesting concept
- you get to go around the garden from a bird-eye view
- lots of good information around the arena about what a cloud forest is
- pretty cool to see the stalactites displays
- very relaxing to enjoy the atmosphere in the cloud forest

Cons:
-I thought it would be better to come in the daytime, so you can see more plants in the daylight, but apart from that, the glowing time at night is pretty entertaining

Tips:
-if you are bringing toddlers, maybe the flower dome is a better choice, it's very slippery and high up.
-don't go if you are in a rush *o*"
,,Refreshing,4.0,,"The indoor Cloud forest might not be up to standards of an outdoor one but it truely is refreshing as you enter and enjoy the mist and sounds of the waterfall.
If you are into plants, this is one place for you in singapore (depending on the season as well). The way these plants are grown will be an eyeopener if you look closely.

Enjoy!"
,,You should try the Top of the World,5.0,,"Top of the World is the most attractive part in Garden by the Bay, besides the waterfall. It's located inside the glass dome. Make sure you won't miss it."
,,Nice and cool,5.0,,Very impressive place with a wonderful man made waterfall. Love walking along the walk way and taking several nice pictures.
,,Interesting place with waterfall inside the dome,5.0,,interesting set up there is a waterfall inside the dome go to the top and take some nice pic there is a small theater for learning journey
,,Loverly Garden,4.0,,"Not recommended for people that's afraid of heights. But if you do like heights, it's very nice, with huge waterfall and nice sky high viewing point."
,,Excellent!!,5.0,,Excellent place. You can see varieties of plants including carnivorous plants. Waterfall is very nice. Overall a very good experience.
,,A great waterfall inside,4.0,,This place is so amazing. There is a waterfall inside it. So cool and fresh around the waterfall. It's really water..hahaha...you can walk upstairs if you want to get more beautiful view. I really enjoy walking around the forest.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Well worth the visit with ground and elevated walkways throughout the attraction. Very well laid out and pleasing to the eye.
,,Pure beauty,5.0,,"Amazing indoors waterfall, the setup is amazing, much more exciting then the other dome. Fully air conditioned, the view is amazing and the walk on the trail around the waterfall is a must. People afraid of heights might cringe."
,,A Great Attraction,4.0,,This is an excellent attraction and definitely worth paying to see. A large area and the elevated sky walk was a welcome surprise as the OCBC Skyway was closed.
,,Not in the list at first,5.0,,"We bought the unlimited shuttle service (SG$3 per person) with tickets (SG$28) for both dome (the not sell it separately for tourist). The dome was not in our must-see list at first because we are unaware of their existence LOL! But thanks to the rainy & gloomy day, we bought the tickets since we can't enjoy the attraction of the Sentosa Island."
,,Good way to learn plants,5.0,,"It's a little bit cold inside here and if you hate to stand at a high place, you won't have fun here. I like it because I can see different sorts of plants in different heights."
,,Like the Amazon just inside,5.0,,Fantastic. I loved the indoor waterfall and how cool it was inside when it was so hot outside. Not for those afraid of heights and walking on elevated platforms
,,Highlight of the trip,5.0,,So far this is the one unmissable attraction we have seen in Singapore. It contains a completely artificial rain forest with a science based explanation of its formation plus some eye popping views and suspended walkways providing breathtaking views of the forest and surrounding attractions.
,,Giant Air Conditioner,5.0,,I admire how they set up the chilly environment inside the dome surrounded with different species of flowers. You can also burn some calories going up the bridge and enjoy a spectacular view of the Marina Bay.
,,cloud forest,5.0,,a must see in singapore simply amazing would recommend taking a jacket as it is quite cold inside the dome .you go up a lift to the top of the dome and walk down on the suspended bridge the plants are so varied and beautiful interesting sculptures mixed in take my hat off to the horticulturists and designers amazing place created a must see
,,Unforgettable,5.0,,To visit this place is an extraordinary appeal. Waterfalls and walk across the bridge down floor by floor is a very exciting adventure and will not be forgotten.
,,Not bad but if you're into plants!!!,3.0,,"I wrote a review for the ""Gardens by the bay"". It's good to visit if you're interested to see plants of different kind."
,,Green and Beautiful,5.0,,"This place is one of the most beautiful place created by human. Serene and Beautiful, this place is just perfect. From the flowers to the evening mist and clouds of water spray, just perfect. A must visit attraction when in Singapore..... specially during evenings."
,,Beautiful and Mysterious Cloud Forest,5.0,,"We were so intrigued to see the world's tallest indoor waterfall while we were at Gardens by the Bay so we purchased a ticket to see it. We weren't disappointed at all by what we saw and it was very magical to experience the humidity of rain forest inside a dome! We walked closer to the waterfall as soon as we saw it and felt the mist on our skin. I think families with kids will definitely enjoy this attraction and the green lush vegetation was very easy to the eyes.

The size of the green mountain was 35 metre high and we enjoyed every step to the mountain top while learning about the biodiversity and plants from tropical highlands."
,,One of the Must Visit Attraction in S'pore,4.0,,This is one of the best artificial garden that I have visited. The design 's really unique and yet really interesting. You can spend 1-2 hrs here without bored and what was important was that the whole family shared the same fun here.
,,Nightime mist created a jurassic world feel!,4.0,,"We went during the leading up to the extra lit up Christmas period and were greeted by mist overflowing down past this waterfall which I didn't expect to see inside the conservatory. It was not too busy and we could wander freely through the misted walks and around past the Lego pitcher plants and Rafflesia to the rest of the dome.

There's sloped paths, elevators and escalators so very wheelchair and pram friendly.

Would definitely go again, recommend my friends to go & take visitors to Singapore too.

See my Gardens by the Bay review re ticket price tips."
,,Simple but beautiful,5.0,,I know the flowers in the flower dome are attractive. Cloud forest has its own green attraction too.
,,Fabulous view of the tropical world,4.0,,Wow how fascinating to visit this intricate example of technology meets nature . Quite inspirational and certainly worth the visit. Like so many things in singapore it is a different take on our culture and way of life. All in such a neat space with spectacular views of the city landscape - loved it
,,Splendid experience,5.0,,"The entry fee is a bit expensive compare to the other attraction in the country. The mountain in the middle of the dome is beautifully done, with the highest man-made waterfall. The most amazing display is at the top of the mountain - a serene pool of water with incredibly well-arranged plants. On the way back down, impressive decorations such as orchids made of lego or dragons and other creatures made of driftwood.Must visit."
,,awesome!,5.0,,"the cloud forest is really worth to visit. we came to gardens by the bay last year but didnt visit this cloud forrest, which is totally wrong!"
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,Able to see some of the flowers that are not so common in the tropics. Take time to roam around and visit every corner of it.
,,A really unique experience,5.0,,"Singapore is apparently one of only two cities which have a rain forest right in the middle of it (the other is Rio), so I was intrigued to visit. I loved it! Very interesting, so different. Women, it's very humid, so don't expect your well-quaffed hair to look good by the end of the visit! And, if you are afraid of heights, you will want to avoid the higher locations (although those were my favorite spots!)"
,,Nice but overcrowded,3.0,,"Nice artificial gardens (just as artificial as most of Singapore). Has a bunch of beautiful plants and a wide variety of species.

The bad: Super crowded. Couldn't get a single photo without people in it. Heck, I could barely walk around without feeling rushed. Moreover, the signs aren't clear and most of the time I could not tell if I was going the right way.

Conclusion: We would not do this again. Not worth the time, money, or effort. Much better places to see in our opinion."
,,Wonderful collection of plants,5.0,,Went there at 9.30am. You will be greeted by a 4-storey waterfall. Place was misty as they were spraying water at the plants. Wheelchair and stroller friendly place. Had a great time.
,,Awesome looking place,5.0,,Place costs for tourists 28S$ (including another concervatory) which is a lot. But if you don't think of the money place looks awesome
,,It's really a cloud forest.,4.0,,Very informative if you want to learn about cloud forests because of the informations posted on the wall. And I've heard that it is the tallest indoor waterfalls.
,,"Fun, Educational, Breath Taking!",5.0,,"We walked from the train station to the venue through more beautiful gardens. This is a must see!! When you first walk in it is refreshing and cool inside as the mist was going and there is an amazing waterfall upon entry! As you look up there is a huge tower of plants and flowers.

Every level has an elevator to get around easily for elderly or children ect. There are mid air walkways which are see through grated floors. Everyone is relaxed walking through the surroundings.

There is an educational video to help us learn how humans are affecting the environment and what changes we need to make in order to continue the planets sustainability.

Great fun."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We didn't have time for both attractions, so my kids chose Cloud Forest. It was beautiful inside and a nice, cool break from the heat outside."
,,Super Tropical rainforest experience at the sunny equator,5.0,,We bought tickets to both the domes and were impressed about the huge waterfall and rainforest through which one comes down through. The other Garden dome is good with variety of plants from around the world but very common for us Aussies where one sees these around the place...
,,Stroll in a Cloud Forest,5.0,,The design and installation of this multilevel Cloud Forest within an enormous greenhouse is nothing short of amazing. Well worth the small admission fee just to experience the waterfall.
,,Wow!,4.0,,"What a marvel! Try to be there at the mist timings of 10,12,2,4pm etc. the walkways and the entire dome and the greenhouse effect are all wonderful"
,,Bring a jacket,4.0,,"Dont miss this when you go to Singapore. Environment awareness was raised when I went here. Also I havent seen anything like it in my country. So it's a good find. Not really extreme heights, but better take care if you have vertigo or fear of heights haha."
,,Neat and a nice way to get out of the heat,5.0,,"I spent a few hours walking through the cloud forest. It wasn't too crowded and I found the cool, misty air to be refreshing from the outside. There are lots of pretty flowers and neat plants to enjoy and it's an easy, peaceful stroll. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Good educational experience,4.0,,"Enjoyable, but very busy on wet walkways. People can be pushy! I think they allowed too many people in at once for a great experience."
,,CLOUD FOREST,4.0,,"Beautiful! The minute u step in, the chilly forest hits u. So if u are dressed in shorts n t-shirt, do bring a shawl at least. There are very old trees n u will love this place especially if u are a tree-hugger. U need to pay to get in here (about USD10), but the main gardens, which is also beautiful, is free. We spent under an hour at the forest n another 2 hours for the rest of the gardens."
,,Stunning,5.0,,What a cool place just cool. Indoor water fall and amazing views with beautiful planrs and sculptures all very tastefully done and on such a grand scale. Costs a bit to see we paid 28 Singapore dollars to see this and the flower dome definitely worth it and a must see. You can a wander at your own pace and easily spend a half day or more in the area. Go earlier in the morning to avoid the crowds and the heat.
,,very hot day out,5.0,,this place is brilliant. costs a little bit to get in all the venues but you can just go into the park and walk around for free. that's what we did. had a great time. I would recommend getting the buggy ride 2 SD each return. well worth it keep your energy for the gardens. I have seen nothing like it before it is iconic.
,,I fell in l o v e.,5.0,,"Loved the cloud forest, definitely the most beautiful of all the gardens by the bay. Id recommend visiting at nightfall, it was the most ambient. Really appreciated the presentation upon exit about climate change- singapore gets 5 million snaps for this installation. Its an art piece in the middle of a modern city dedicated to eco awareness. So beautiful."
,,Very Beautiful!,4.0,,"Cloud forest is one of the best green spaces in Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyed the flora, fauna and the waterfall. Its a wonderful experience walking all the way and enjoying the beautiful views."
,,Nice Walk from Level 8 through the simulated forest!,4.0,,"Amazing experience , must definitely try it out ! The spray of water definitely keeps the feel of a rain forest. At places, the walkway is sloping and need to be careful with young children, but the thrill of the walk down is amazing."
,,The better dome,5.0,,"If you want to visit only 1 of the 2 domes, visit this one. Very unique and educational for children"
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, this section is an air conditioned domed area with a central tower, waterfalls and elevated walkways. The lifts and gentle slope of the walkway makes for easy wheelchair access.
Right at the top on level 7 is a reflection pond. Cascading from the tower is a waterfall."
,,Beautiful and important to visit,5.0,,The cloud forest is located in Gardens By the Bay. It cost 16 S$ for adults (12 if you are a local) and I would say that if you just want to visit one of the conservatory you should visit this one! Not only is it beautiful inside with a waterfall and amazing plats but it also bring up important issues like global warming and it explains it really good for both kids and grown ups. It is definitely worth a visit!
,,Incredible Singapore,4.0,,wonderful experience; peaceful & cool. don't forget to take an umbrella for shade once you get outside.
,,Stunning,4.0,,Amazing fauna and floura with a cooling waterfall. They have an array of colours from all the flowers and the wonderful scent you get is intoxicating.
,,Trip in the clouds,5.0,,"The best, most amazing man made structure I have ever seen! I could have spent hours just looking at the views, not to mention the gorgeous plants and sculptures! This is a stop not to be missed on a trip to Singapore! It was easy to move about with the children and they were fascinated by everything too!"
,,It is freezing cold in there.,4.0,,"I guess it is 5 degree in there, i was a frozen raw meat! Otherthan that, they have a beautiful man made waterfall which i am sure everyone loves!"
,,Water fall,5.0,,"A must go for those who love forest shower! embrace in the water fall and the tree top walk. For travellers who wants a place to chill in a superb air con place, this is the best place to visit. For Singapore, be the garden member n u can enjoy unlimited visit per yr, be it going in for the aircom after a run, or just chilling in this beautiful walkway n listen to the song of the water fall"
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,Loved the cloud forest - so imaginative and so inspiring. Go right to the top and then walk your way down via the various walkways to get the full experience.
,,Visit at night,5.0,,"We visited at night, actually we wanted to go on the Supertee Skywalk but this was far too busy being only a few days before Christmas.
Are we glad that we then opted for the Cloud Forest - absolutely. An amazing experience to wander down from tree top level, especially under illumination at night. An insight into the tropical world above us."
,,A marvelous feat Congrats Singapore,5.0,,What an awesome structure so beautifully planned bringing Singapore reach heights for first place enjoyed every moment and best of all its wheel chair ace lie thanks Singapore
,,ReallMy favorite part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Take a walk through the future in this well designed attraction that highlights the architecture and ambience a little more than the actual plant life. I went at night and found the lighting and ethereal misty air really cool.
,,My favourite part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The entry fee might be on the steep side, but I think it's absolutely worthwhile. As soon as you enter the artificial dome, you feel the coolness and humidity of the air - the dome simulates the climate you would find in the high reaches of Africa's highest mountains. The 'mountain' in the middle of the dome is beautifully done, with the highest man-made waterfall coming straight off the top (at least according to the leaflet). If you're lucky, you're in there when they pump water vapour into the dome - suddenly from a thousand small vents, fog comes up and envelopes everything, it makes for great pictures! You can then walk up and down the mountain in walkways (often connected with lifts). The most amazing display though is at the very top of the mountain - a serene pool of water with incredibly well-arranged plants, really nicely done! Also, as you wander back down, there are lots of tiny details that are amazing - watch out for orchids made of Lego (but you only see that when you're up close) or little dragons and other creatures made of driftwood."
,,Like paradise...,5.0,,Waterfall and misty atmosphere.. Like paradise... Take your time to admire the exotic flowers and plants. Its almost therapeutic:)
,,Cloud gardens,5.0,,"A fantastic place to walk through the huge range of plants, set out, continent displays everything was wonderful. The rainforest area and walk around was amazing."
,,I don't get it,3.0,,"I suspect my negative review is because I expected this to be something it wasn't. By the pictures I thought it was going to be a tropical dome filled with plants and animals. Giving you a slice of the jungle in the middle of Singapore. Instead it was just some nicely arranged plants in a freezing cold dome. There is some educational stuff below but by the time I got to it I was pretty bored.

If you live in a big city and have never seen a man made waterfall or really want to find a crowded place with AC then this will appeal to you. Otherwise I don't think it's worth the time or money."
,,Love the cloud forest !!,4.0,,Spent more than 1 hour inside the cloud forest. There is a long bridge which will bring you to every individual level for different views. Had our lunch at the foodcourt nearby. The chicken rice and Nasi lemak was great!!
,,We really enjoyed this,5.0,,"A really remarkable structure with beautiful plantings, well signed. One of the most remarkable things, which would have made the visit worth it all alone, is the collection of beautiful wood carvings. Some are from other countries, Pacific islands, others are amazingly creative developments of tree roots and branches. Fun being up high and seeing out to the rest of the city as well."
,,A very calm environment,5.0,,"First step into this area and I was immediately sprayed with photo from the magnificent waterfall! It isn't natural of course, but it's still breathtaking.

The entire area is much smaller than the Flower Dome, but it's equally beautiful. There is only one path to explore the area, which I find helpful, as I wouldn't want to accidentally miss an area. Be sure to cover your phones or any valuable items, as they can get wet if you're just holding them in your hand(without covering)

The top of the waterfall/mountain is a great place for a photo opportunity, as you can see the Marina Bay Sands from there. There is a small water feature at the top which was really interesting. It itself was a good photo subject,as it's one of those ""which is the actual piece, and which is the reflection"" kind of subject.

Overall, a wonderful experience and would definitely come back again during other festivities!"
,,Wonderful and must visit,5.0,,Wonderfully developed and maintained.. innovative concepts used to keep you active and engaged and not make walking boring. Lovely plants and flowers.
,,Fantastic outing!,4.0,,Excellent place with nice arrangement of botanical delights. The flamingo anthurium was something that was awesome. There is an artificial waterfall with the water misting around creating a 'cloud' of water that makes this a wonderful outing
,,Great!!!,5.0,,This attraction is less popular than the Flower Dome but it certainly isn't worse than FD! It is in fact more private and mystical with the magnificent waterfall and high bridges. It was very comfortable and cooling but people with a fear of heights should just walk through the bridges at the lower levels.
,,Disability friendly,5.0,,"This is an excellent botanic experience like no other!
The facility is, as the title suggests, friendly for disabled people.
Take the elevator to the top floor and slowly descend through the cloud-like environment enjoying the view both internal and external.
A bit damp in some places, but you are in the tropics!
Very worthwhile experience."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is my second visit to Gardens by the Bay and I was impressed with how much things have grown in since visiting 12 months ago!
It is very informative and the variety of plants here is unbelievable! The price for such an attraction is also very good.
Word of advice, bring a jacket if you feel the cold. Both domes are cooled and combined with the waterfall, it can get a bit chilly!"
,,Wow,5.0,,"'m pretty jaded with respect to tourist attractions. After a while they all seem to be the same. However the Cloud Garden and the associated Gardens by the Sea touched even this old curmudgeon. If you go to Singapore and see only one attraction, dump Sentosa, dump Orchard Road, dump the Zoos and go here."
,,Nice gardens,3.0,,"This was a nice garden, would be great for children to see the clouds. We went as adults and whilst it was good would not recommend this to other adults. Lots of school groups coming in. Also you can just do the one garden at an individual price which is not shown on the brochures or price list."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"What a wonderful surprise. We have been to domes before but this one is really well designed with so much lush vegetation, water and flowers, particularly the orchids and the Lego model plants add something special."
,,Great learning experience and so many beautiful flowers.,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a great experience. It has litterly hundreds of orcids, and the bramilads (sp) the palms are spectacular!!"
,,Cool place,4.0,,The only attraction to me is the sky walk and the coolness. Prefer the waterfall in jurong bird park thot.
,,Must visit for a splendid experience,5.0,,"This is a huge glass dome with forest, waterfall and a pond inside. The place is accessible through MRT to Bayfront station followed by 10-15 mins walk. Inside the glass dome plants and trees are placed on a mountain structure (Height of 6 storey building)
You may buy single ticket to Cloud Forest or combined ticket for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Online ticketing is advised to avoid queue.
Once you enter the dome you will be taken to one floor lower to the top floor through lift. Then you have to climb to the top floor through stairs and then get all the way down through the forest walkway. There is plenty of photo opportunity during the walk down. You can also see the beautiful Marina bay surroundings. Check out mist timings before you enter. I think mist is released at some intervals then it feels like walking through the clouds. Once you get down you will see a beautiful pond and a few wooden sculptures."
,,Great feel of the forrest!,5.0,,"Eventhough this is not a real forrest, the artificial wind, mist will make you feel like you are in in a real forrest!The top view from the 7th level is amazing. It also provides educational videos so we can learn how important forrest is for humanbeing."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,What a great way to see plants and it's got air con so I was happy to spend a long time wandering around taking lots of photos. Not good if you suffer from vertigo though! Don't look down :D
,,Fun and educational,3.0,,"The skywalk is enjoyable. You not only get to experience the different foliage at different altitudes, you get to enjoy Singapore's skyline as well. Within the Skywalk structure, you have crystal exhibits and a short video about climate change. Surprising there is so much space here. Just wish there were more exhibits and interactive activities for kids."
,,new experience,5.0,,I'm a bit scared of the height but it was a good decision to walk up stair. I just could not take picture of the ground by myself from up there.
,,Fun place to visit. Cooler on a hot day,5.0,,"So much to see in here. A visit to both domes is recommended. They are each quite different. Green and lush. Informative, and a lot of detail to look out for. Some lovely flowers"
,,Amazing variety,5.0,,I had no idea what to expect when we entered. It was an amazing experience. Different levels featuring different eco themes. Highly recommended.
,,Great excursion for the kids,5.0,,The Cloud Forest was a really good educational experience for the kids. They were amazed by the waterfall which greeted them and asked many questions on the type of flora and fauna around.
,,Great place,4.0,,Great place with skywalk. Do wear comfortable shoes and bring a jacket though as it could get quite cold in there.
,,Just the crowds,3.0,,"Really a great attraction with plenty to see. The engineering is spectacular and you can't fault the care that has gone into it.

It's hardly surprising then that it gets so crowded and unfortunately for us this detracted from the enjoyment. The constant press of people and shuffling forward diminished it for us. At a quieter time with less people we would readily have rated this more highly."
,,A lot of fun,4.0,,"A lovely spot to enjoy plants you can't see in the Botanical Gardens and get some relief from the heat. Getting there, ticketing and access were all easy. The trail around the mountain is laid out well so, even though it was busy, we never felt too crowded. The plants were in very good condition; the sculptures throughout are a nice touch and provide many photo opportunities. The view of the bay beyond would have been lovely but for the haze. The whole place was clean, despite the challenge of the damp and all the visitors. Avoid the cantilevered walkways if you are afraid of heights and use the lifts instead. The only thing we didn't like was the heavy-handed environmental messaging presented in some chambers inside the mountain."
,,Another Choice,3.0,,"Cloud Forest could be a choice if you are on holiday to Singapore, the air in Singapore can be fairly hot, but if you come in here you will feel cold, cool, enjoying Singapore in different sides, it would not hurt you to try to come to this place .."
,,Garden in the sky,5.0,,Enjoyed the walk throughout the garden with my boy. There was a good collection of different unique plants n flowers within. Cool impressive vertical garden. The bridges in the air was fun.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"An absolute amazing experience. It is very cool and refreshing, the air is so clean. There are 7 or so levels with viewing areas, where you can walk around and see everything, even the views outside"
,,Worth a trip!,5.0,,"Fantastically organised, you walk downhill most of the way with spectacular views on the entire descent. Can take a number of fantastic photos, even feel the waterfall in one place :)"
,,Extremely well maintained plants,5.0,,It's a collection of plants from cold and/or tropical areas. The place has been kept cool and has hundreds of plants from across the world. It also houses the ice crystals from various caves of the world. All in all an amazing place to visit.
,,"AMAZING CLOUD FOREST IN GARDEN BY THE BAY, SINGAPORE",5.0,,"The Cloud Forest in Garden by the Bay duplicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountains. It features a ""Cloud Mountain"", about 150 feet tall and accessible by an elevator and a circular path leads one to a waterfall about 120 feet tall. The ""Cloud mountain"" is a structure covered by orchids, ferns, peacock ferns, and other plants."
,,love it,5.0,,different every time you go the water fall is the best there are lifts so you do not have to walk all the way to the top
,,Cool and misty after dinner walk to see the skylines,5.0,,"Had satay at the nearby satay by the bay and walked along the bay to cloud dome to cool things down in sunny and humid Singapore, and to look at the bay and its skyline from different vantage points.

Entrance to the cloud dome was very relaxing, windy and a cool almost 20 degrees experience with the accompanying waterfall experience. As we moved on, there were mist and comfortably felt that we were in some temperate place or highlands.

Beautiful sights of plants and the surrounding night lights from the skylines of the Marina Bay and the giant super tree structures of Gardens by the bay awaited us and our cameras.

Looking for a breathtaking and quiet bonding activity with family after dinner, this is the place I did recommend for a healthy experience."
,,Thoroughly enjoyable walk in the Forest,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest attraction is like no other attraction I've ever seen. It's both educational, interesting, amazingly beautiful and well designed. It consists of these walkways that circle the dome and waterfall, and everywhere you turn, there are some beautiful plants and shrubbery. When set against the city landscape, it makes for some picturesque settings. Not necessarily for the faint of heart if you're afraid of heights, especially if you walk around the edges of the walkway and look down, but is worth the thrill."
,,Refreshing!!,5.0,,"Greenery, natural+ man made beauty and great views of the city combined in one attraction. It is also home to the tallest indoor waterfall in the world ... Must Not miss this one."
,,Beuatiful,5.0,,"Breathtaking attraction, so many different flowers set amongst a fantastic water feature. Well worth the visit."
,,Amazing experience not to be missed,5.0,,Breath taking views with rare plants. Hats off to Singapore for building such a master piece. Keep at least 2 hours to enjoy and admire this place.
,,Ok but could be a lot more,3.0,,"The Cloud Forest is OK to visit but can easily be walked through within 20 mins. The highlight is a waterfall in the middle which isn't all that and ""misting"" which is not worth waiting around for.

There is a lot of the metal structure which should be covered to make it more green."
,,STUNNING,5.0,,"This is what Heaven looks like! So peaceful, tranquil and relaxing! This may be my favourite place on earth!"
,,Really great along with flower dome,5.0,,Unfortunately the skyway was closed the day I visited but this was well worth the wander through. Takes some time and as it was just before Xmas the displays were pretty impressive.
,,Lush rainforest,5.0,,"Of the two conservatories, I much preferred Cloud Forest over Flower Dome. From the magnificent waterfall at the entrance to the multi-levels of colorful flora, this is an attraction you don't want to miss.

The first misting is at 10 AM and then every 2 hours after that. It makes for cooler ambiance and photos, but it's not a must in case your timing doesn't fit the schedule. There is also a room and movie at the end of the tour which gives insightful information about global warming and conservation."
,,"Amazing ""Rain"" Forest type setting",5.0,,The views appear natural and allow you to view the inside a controlled environment with the best in person close up encounter as possible.
,,Amazing what you can put under a glass roof.,5.0,,We spend two hours just in this glass capsule. Looking at all the fauna and flora from the different rainforest of the world.
,,"A very cool attraction, how do they maintain all those plants.",4.0,,"Located at gardens by the bay and admission to both this and the flower dome cost 28 sing dollars for a non resident ticket but even cheaper for a resident.
The cloud forest demonstrates how plants differ at different levels in the rainforest.
It is a huge structure and is definitely worth a visit."
,,Transports you to,5.0,,"Singapore set for itself the very admirable and ambitious goal of being a ""city in a garden"" and Gardens by the Bay is the center piece of that vision.
It amazes me how Singapore pushes the limits of human imagination and innovation when it comes to public services and Cloud Forest is a prime example of that.
So, you have the world's tallest indoor water fall that takes your breath away the moment you enter the dome. Around the waterfall, multiple levels of mountain flora is built and documented and you can ""trek"" up the ""mountain"".
At the very top is a ""secret garden"" dotted with orchids and a view of the sky through the dome's roof.
Overall, the Cloud Forest leaves an impression on you for the sheer beauty of human imagination and Singapore's commitment to push the bar higher!"
,,Explosion of colour and good taste.,5.0,,"Nothing prepared me for the beautiful mini-gardens from all around the world, showing specific plants and beautifully designed displays. Unusual combination of an art exhibition and flower arrangements for you to discover and remember.
You should not miss this magical experience.
Take with you a good quality camera and enjoy!"
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,This is a new attraction in singapore . It is beautifully made . The colour ful water fall welcomes you .there is a suspended bridge with lovely flora and beautiful landscape . A real must .
,,Brilliant,4.0,,"The indoor waterfall is spectacular and unique. The plants around the waterfall add to the overall display. At night the place is really cool and interesting. The small displays are good too, adding to the experience. Would recommend this place to any tourist(s) in the area"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I'm so pleased we went to the Cloud Forest as the entire area is stunning, it was a shame that the Flower Dome was closed but if we return we'll definitely go there and also return to the Cloud Forest,"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Of the two gardens at Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest is by far the better of the two. With it's soaring construction and different plants living at different levels of the simulated cloud forest, it provides insight into the land of the Maylay peninsula in an easy to travel to package. The air conditioning provides a delightful added respite to the often hot and humid Singapore weather.

If you have a fear of heights, this attraction may not be for you, as walking down the catwalks can be a dizzying experience. But it is well worth the effort."
,,Artificial waterfall,5.0,,"at first I confused to choose between cloud forest or flower dome,some consideration was at that time there wasn't tulip event and finally I choose cloud forest and I didn't regret at all. I was very beautiful indoor park and state of the art dome design"
,,Minf blowing,5.0,,"The man-made waterfall is amazing. The plants that surround the waterfall are gorgeous. I think it's well worth the money to enter the Cloud Forest, the views as you go higher are great."
,,Impressive place,5.0,,The Cloud Forest arboretum is the more impressive of the 2 in Garden by the Bay. You walk in and you see a big waterfall coming down right infront of you. It is cool and humid inside so its a good escape from the hot Singapore weather. You can also see many interesting plants. I particularly liked their collection of insect eating plants. Definitely the highlight of the Garden by the bay.
,,Splendid setting....,5.0,,"A must for a nice stroll, just by the Sands Marina Bay. Gardening and architecture at its best. Singapore always amazing."
,,Must see,5.0,,This amazing Cloud forets is an absolute must-go-to while visiting Gardens by the Bay. Worth the (high) entance fee..
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We were amazed by the idea and thought about the hard work of maintaining of all those beautiful flowers, plants and the great job the people are doing. It was also nice to walk on the path where a scene of a movie we watched a week before was shot:)"
,,Perfect for nature lovers!,4.0,,The feeling that you are walking around a rainforest is surreal. The different kinds of plants and the artificial waterfalls are a sight to behold. It only lacks one thing: the sight and sounds of birds to make it truly realistic. The other interesting sections are the Earth Watch and the -5 Degrees. They warn us about the ill effects of over population and the destruction of rain forests.
,,Very green and exotic! Real Rain Forest,5.0,,"So far away from Rain forest, Singapore has created this Rain Forest in a dome, that you feel like real. The collection of plants and flowers is exotic and very extensive and arranged very nicely. The best attraction of this is the 100 ft. high waterfall, and you stand under it to get wet by its showers!
We enjoyed it very much.
The surroundings of Garden by the Bay is very good, Rain Forest is part of this garden. Don't miss the SkyWalk."
,,Rainforest and Waterfall in A Glass of Dome,5.0,,"Resemble the name, it has floating pathway around the grand man-made waterfall, so it feels like walk on the 'cloud'.

If you have fear of the height I recommend you to stay close to your friends, because even it's so safe it's still terrifying. Hahaha. If you can't stand the cold, better to bring a cardigan/jacket, moreover if you spend your time here on the evening. The water from the waterfall plus air conditioner make this place a little bit chilly.

You definitely have to bring your camera. Because the scenery from above was just so amazing. You can capture the architectural structure, Singapore skyline, greenery below, that terrifying pathway, and all of those awesomeness."
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"Visitors are welcomed with an amazing waterfall. It's a good way to relax, by being close to nature with the comfort of indoor place."
,,This must be what Shangri-La Was Like!,5.0,,"Of the two attractions at Gardens by the Bay, this is the one to go to....Beautiful flowers, plants and a stunning array of water falls and waterworks awaits you. Doesn't require a whole day...An hour to 90-mins. will do. If you can't mke it to Singapore's Botanical Gardens ( which trump this...), this is a nice afternoon. An architectural feat, keeping the suns rays from burning up all the plants and flowers.....Amazing."
,,Worth it every time!,5.0,,"We love the cloud forest. It's a real ""wow"" moment every time we take Singapore visitors to see it. And we never get tired of seeing it again. There's nothing else really quite like it, that we've seen in all our travels. Beautiful, educational, serene.
One tip: it's cold in there! Take a jacket!"
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,Absolutely fascinating experience - travelling from the peak of the mountain to the floor and experiencing the tropical delights was amazing. Found the interior spaces a little disappointing - lost opportunity. Overall worth a visit.
,,Great Waterfall,4.0,,A great manmade waterfall. cool place to take a stroll and nice place for macro shooting. Best to go during festivals where there is some special decorations
,,One Time Visit !!,3.0,,"Only Attraction is the artificial waterfall. Apart from this, This doesn't hold good for the price it is asking"
,,Waterfall is the highlight,5.0,,Lots to see and do but the waterfall when you first go in is wonderful. Must see attraction. We loved it.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Absolutely highly recommend both of the domes (though this was my fave of the two). I wouldn't worry about being there for the misting though (we hung around waiting for it) as it doesn't really add anything to this already awesome attraction.
,,Cool Forest!,5.0,,"I love going to Cloud Forest. So cool and relaxing! especially on a hot day in Singapore! I need not travel to another country to experience the nature! It is right at my ""door-step""! I will always bring overseas friends to this place."
,,Amazing garden forest,5.0,,It is not just a garden but a rain forest with countless species of flowers and plants of which some are unique in the world. The sky bridge makes you feel so exciting to see all the directions and you do not really feel you are in house if you do not see the glass. You can have different surprises every time you go as the flowers change over times.
,,Nature in a nutshell!,4.0,,"If you are into flowers and plants, then this surely is a must for your to visit. You walk into a completely enclosed building, fully air-conditioned, with a man made hill inside, with flowers and plants in a natural setting. Rare flowers and plants are all within view, close up. My friends from a neighboring country said that it would be difficult to see some of the flowers in their country, even if one trudges through forests - but here they are - all for you to see, in air conditioned comfort."
,,A very cool garden,4.0,,"This unique garden was very cool, but this is a nice experience for me to explore this during 12-13 Dec trip to SG. It has the big waterfall with the nice planting on it, but I suggest you bring a coat/sweater when you go there as for me it's very cold."
,,Definitely worth the time and effort,5.0,,The whole experience including this dome and the 'Flower Dome' are definitely worth the time and effort whilst visiting the Gardens by the Bay. This is definitely a must go-to in Singapore.
,,My 1st Visit to Cloud Forest,4.0,,"I am a Singaporean and last Friday was my 1st visit to this place. The """"huge"""" waterfall at the entrance is very impressive. It is a good photo taking spot too.
A very """"unique"""" walking experience on the high walkways. From the high spots, you can see Singapore from different angles. Beautiful flowers and many unknown plants are nice to take photos for memory. For Singapore weather, everyone wants to enjoy the cool weather in Cloud Forest!"
,,Rain Forest Replica,4.0,,"Feeling like in borneo, they duplicate the rainforest here with artificial waterfall, the plants, the weather packed in an indoor cold room. Amazing"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Worth a visit loved the water fall and all the plants think they over did it with the Christmas theme though but still very good
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,A must see! The gardens are spectacular. The pathways around are beautiful and there are hidden wood carvings everywhere. So many beautiful plants working in harmony to create oxygen. Tip...it is cold for some people so bring a light sweater or jacket.
,,Forest like nature at the cloud forest,5.0,,"A very good place to spend sometime with families, relax and ease your mind. Feel the forest like nature inside the dome. Beat the heat and feel the winter like weather where the temperature is between 23 to 25 degrees Celsius."
,,Spectacular Outing,5.0,,"Ok, I had no idea what to expect before i stepped into the Cloud. This place was amazing. Such an incredible use of space - felt like it was 10 times the actual size. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. I can't wait to visit it again someday!"
,,Wow!!,5.0,,"Well worth a visit! We visited in the evening but I think it would be equally impressive during a daytime visit. There is a tree-top walk, a waterfall, a cavern-like area with stalagmites and stalactites and lots and lots of information."
,,So Good So Cheap,5.0,,"This is a magnificent experience and should be experienced by everyone who visits Singapore plus it is so cheap for visitors $28 for the two domes. It also has the advantage that it has to be the coolest place in Singapore. The problem is when you visit the dome you do not know where to look as there is so much to see. When you fist walk in you are looking a this large waterfall which set the tone for the experience. From here you should go to the top of the mountain and follow the walkway to the bottom through the micro environments. Here the colours of the flowers especially the orchids and all the ferns, lichens is to be experienced. Around every corner is another display of colour. If you do not go then you are going to miss out on a wounderful experience."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Really enjoyed my time here! However it was slightly slippery here and there because of the mist/water.
,,cloud forest,4.0,,we spent here for an hour. its an indoor forest and waterfall. Great effort although you can feel the artificiality. I did not enjoy much. Natural is always natural.
,,The falls,5.0,,"I love the idea of making an indoor waterfall! Affordable price ticket, which you can buy a ticket package also. Very recommended to take your parents nor your grandparents here, friendly access to wheelchair. Best gardens i've ever visited. Will come back for sure with my parents!"
,,Really cool walkways and waterfall,5.0,,"Walking through the forest, especially up high, was very relaxing and entertaining at the same time. Enjoyed going up to the top and walking back down while checking out the plants and humans. Definitely worth going to!"
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Cloud Forest makes me feel like walking through the rain forest. You will be surprised by the waterfall once you get inside. Enjoy yourself while you walking along the ups and down walkway and surrounded with fog. Imagine yourself walking into a mysterious space and get lost in the wonderland. One thing have to mention is the design of this place, amazing, breathtaking no matter what place you standing and from which angle you look, you would find something interesting and great view. Absolutely once in a life time experience!"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"The cloud forest is a must if you visit Gardens by the Bay. The waterfalls are magnificent, can't believe it is all man-made."
,,Air-conditioned forest 😊,5.0,,If any one of you love nature this place is for you. I love everything they build but my favourite is waterfall. We went in December so they decorated forest for Christmas. We spent 2-3 hours there and loved it.
,,Lovely to visit,5.0,,"Included in ticket to the flower garden, worth a visit to see the large waterfall and tread the walkway underneath"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,This is part of the Gardens by the Bay. Very interesting and good views. Fully narrated with photos etc. Takes at least an hour.
,,Nice cooling Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Be it rain or shine, you can spend a wonderful time relaxing here. Nice photo shoot and family time."
,,Must see in singapore,5.0,,"Observe in awe in this magnificent man made garden, complete with the highest indoor man made waterfall, it can be kinda chilly, but its a good hideout in the sunny sweaty singapore.
Many interesting information on plants can be found, great place to teach the kids some new stuffs."
,,Learn about Nature,4.0,,"Book a guide, it cost me $200 and you can bring a group of up to 20 people. Entrance tickets are discounted if you book a guide. The guide met us at 9 am in the morning. It was the right time to get into the 2 enclosures. In 2 hours you get to understand all the flora and trees. Eventually ending the guided tour at the cloud forest, right about the time to see the rainbows if the sun is shining. Thereafter your ticket allows for full day re-entry till they close.

I can't remember the exact date I was there, but I remembered how much I enjoyed it."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"We loved this place. It was such a beautiful place. The plants, trees, waterfalls were amazing. This place is not to be missed when in Singapore."
,,A photogenic attraction!,4.0,,"Cloud Forest showcases plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000 metres above sea level. The whole conservatory is temperature-controlled to match the environment they come from. It features a 35-metre-tall mountain covered in lush vegetation, shrouding the world’s tallest indoor waterfall.

Take the lift to the top of the mountaintop to discover the unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests, and then take a stroll along a walkway in the clouds for an aerial view of the canopy and mountainside below."
,,Like a dream land,5.0,,"Certainly one of the most impressive indoor gardens in the world, the Cloud Forest should be on anyone's, three day itinerary for Singapore. Even if you are not a nature lover, this impressive display is an engineering marvel, and is a great place to go in and get cooled off on a warm (hot!) day."
,,Head in the Clouds,4.0,,"Spectacular introduction to the plants of the upper reaches of the rain forest. Educational as well as enjoyable, especially the high platforms that bring you up close to the plants. Well worth a visit."
,,Stunning and interesting experience,5.0,,Really enjoyed our visit to the Cloud Forest - didn't think it would be as good as it was but it was really interesting and a bit surreal to be in an actual cloud forest. However didn't rate the adjacent flower dome - this is definitely the better of the two.
,,gardens by the bay,4.0,,"Best bit about the gardens, very different to what we had expected, enjoyed the ""misting""effect.which happens every few hours. Enjoyed much more than the other dome which was some tropicalflowers and Christmas decorations."
,,So overrated,2.0,,This place was so overrated! I didn't really understand what was the point of creating this dome. Waste of money and nothing special.
,,Wander through the Clouds at various levels..this good.,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay....follow the walk trail into the clouds...plenty to see..many carvings and statues hidden amongst the foilage.

It is easy to get around..take your time - there are lifts and escalators to make it easy up and down.

It is an adventure in airconditioned comfort..watch out for the waterfall...it has plenty of mist.

Enjoy the Cloud Forrest..its worth the admission fee."
,,Never seen anything like it,5.0,,"This place was so cool. I have never seen anything like it, so it was worth seeing. If you are interested in nature this is the place for you to read about plants, flowers and climate change. It cost money to go in, but again we thought it was worth it. I was freezing and needed to wear my jacket with shorts the whole time, so if you get cold easily bring a jacket. They have a mist show, you're not really missing much if you miss it. It's like the same misters that they use on our vegetables and the grocery store. Otherwise it is cool and their is a lot to see and read!"
,,Explore amidst plants from cool moist tropical lands,5.0,,This is amazing and well worth a visit. It features one of the worlds tallest indoor waterfalls and features towering vertical gardens with plant life from around the world!
,,Probably not what I was expecting,2.0,,"Rather crowded. To be frank it's just not the type of attraction that interest me. Furthermore, Singapore don't do interior design well had hope, too tacky, too theme park like and they should have taken out all the wood craft."
,,BEST,5.0,,"This is the best part of the whole park gardens by the bay , engineering and nature both at there best , hard to fault and would be loved by young and old alike"
,,"Nice attraction to feel ""as in nature"" in the heart of the city",4.0,,How simple clever people can create a forest in the middle of a metropole where only skyscrapers can be found everywhere. You do not worry about the many rainshowers as you stay indoors.
,,You must imagine you are in a Cloud Forest,3.0,,"Engineering, technology and sufficient resources can achieve most things and the Garden by the Bay is a prime example of an 'attraction' designed and built on a grand scale. The size and scale of the domes which house the forest and garden display are quite awesome, but the whole experience is inspired more by Disneyland than the great gardens of the world. At night time our visit was made more spectacular by thousands of lights, the sounds of the tropical jungle, cascading water, and clouds of fine mist and moisture when the massive sprinkler system. One floor dedicated to an audio visual presentation of the environmental effects of climate change was engaging and thought provoking. How ironic ! But no, we were told that the Garden by the Bay is wholly sustainable generating its own power and recycling water. Personally, if I choose to visit a garden, I prefer to see plants and trees in their natural habitat than in a manufactured environment, even one on the scale of the Garden by the Bay. However it should not be missed on any visit to Singapore, as the attraction sums up the city so well."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,AMAZING - this was one of the best attractions we went too. Fabulous job on this. Provide your SQ Boarding Pass to receive 10% off tickets.
,,Loved it,5.0,,Worth paying for and if one gets there early one can enjoy the garden almost to oneself Highly recommended for all to visit
,,Fabulous nature & technology,5.0,,Cloud Forest is a green house of large proportions hosting a mountain shape cloud forest and a waterfall. A skywalk will take you to the top and back to see this wonder. If you can't see Cloud Forest and Flower Dome I strongly believe Cloud Forest is a better choice.
,,Unique garden,3.0,,This was something indecided to do since i was in the area walking around. I would have to say it is a very unique indoor garden with a layout i have never ever seen before. If you are afraid of heights i dont suggest you do this. There is alot of walking involved and you want to have comfortable shoes to talk in. Very different from your standard indoor garden
,,Way more than a regular tourist place; amazing domes,5.0,,You just have to go here if you are in Singapore. It's best to go here in the afternoon when temperatures are high as this is a controlled environment. The biosphere is a marvel where you can spend hours depending on your mood.
,,Musr see,5.0,,"Absolutely incredible.Includes waterfall,stalactites and videos about climate change and how this renewable enery powered attraction works.28 dollars."
,,A must see at gardens by the bay!,5.0,,Cloud Forest was exceptional! Everything about the attraction was marvelous! Three of us girls went and we enjoyed every part of this especially the whimsical waterfall.
,,Awe,5.0,,"I love Cloud Forest! Complete with a gushing waterfall, a small pool ,and a bridge ,this place is totally awesomeThe ONE AND ONLY THING THAT IS BAD IS:It is very cold so bring a jacket

Tip:Buy a Gardens By The Bay membership to get free admission."
,,"Cold mist, mini waterfall, and plants (plus orchids) thats all.",3.0,,"If you are expecting beautiful flowers, go to flower dome instead of this one. Cloud dome is more for forestry and wild plants so if you dont really know anything about plants, all you see is green and green. And it makes you feel sleepy too because of the cold aircon, quiet and soothing water sound from the waterfall. A good place to destress and rest awhile. Interesting spots can be found near entrance for its mini waterfall, then you can go up to top floor to enjoy the view and some flowers including orchids, walk down the path to basically see everything. You cant eat inside the dome so just munch some tidbits or drinks if you are really hungry. Best spot for taking pics would be the waterfall and the hanging bridge/path from top floor."
,,An experienced like none other,5.0,,Beautiful and totally futuristic. Just awe inspiring! Loved the waterfall and the cool air conditioning too.
,,Great place to cool off!,5.0,,"I was surprised at how cool it was in here. It was such a welcome relief from the humidity outside. I don't really do well in muggy places. Apart from appreciating the cool temperature, the cloud forest is a fascinating place, with a huge waterfall. There are many different plants to look at on the 'mountain' on several levels, each accessible with lift and aerial walkways and bridges around the mountain. There's a crystal and stalactites exhibition, and even an amazing lego carnivorous plant display, which I'm not sure if it's permanent or not. There are also quite a few seats and benches to relax on. You exit on the lower level, which has a shop and a little food stall with ice creams such as orchid, lavender and rose.

Definitely worth the money!"
,,True to nature,4.0,,"Your ticket includes the Forest and the Flower Garden. It is a beautiful replica of a Cloud Forest, with all the plants and features typical of it including a gorgeous waterfall. You go up and then down the mountain on a walkway. The air conditioning is VERY cold! Bring a light sweater at least!"
,,"Beautiful floral, clever architecture",4.0,,"This is a very enjoyable place to visit for a few hours to cool off, or a long time if you love plants.
The Cloud Forest is spectacular with the largest collection of carnivorous plants Ive ever seen. The waterfall is amazing.
Bring a jacket as it can get chilly."
,,must see,5.0,,"Along with the outdoor super trees, the cloud forest is the highlight of the Gardens by the Bay. This is a wonderful walk through a cool and green and inviting cloud forest."
,,Little Adventure on it's own,4.0,,Referring to my comments on Gardens by the Bay and Flower Dome and Cloud Forest as part of the Gardens it's a must see.Nice climate inside with a waterfall stretching over 5 levels and flowers blossom everywhere just amazing.
,,Another Awesome Handicapped Accessible Experience,5.0,,This was a great thing to do and there were elevators for the handicapped so they could enjoy it too.Very impressive.
,,It could have been Better,4.0,,"So they spray mist during certain times and thats the whole point of it. I was expecting more mist then what actually happened and within minutes it was gone. It was fun to walk on glass bridge but if there was more mist, it would have been much much better. Plan your trip so you catch mist when you are on one of the glass bridges. They also have a indoor fall. Thats also good to hang around."
,,Not too much to see,3.0,,To me the flower dome is much more impressive. The cloud forest is essentially a huge fountain in a dome shape covered by plants. The skywalk is nice but takes about 10min. A bit disappointing if I had bought the ticket for the cloud forest alone ($12). Both entrance for the cloud forest and dome flower is $20 for foreign people.
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,Now we understand why this was highly rated - it's really an magical experience! Definitely worth visiting. Would skip the flower dome though as it was a bit average...
,,photography site,4.0,,"good for those who loves to take photos, indoor nature is a new attraction, will be crowded during events, beware!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,Very nice.. Certenaly something you must have seen while in Singapore! Also the Flowerdome is great...take the combi-entrace
,,Must visit !,5.0,,Its little costly... 38 SGD for 2 attractions... But good to experience once. If you are on limited budget... Then only skip this place...
,,Awesome garden,5.0,,"We really loved Cloud Forest. We visited Flower Dome first and left this gem as second. I think this was the right choice as Cloud Forest is much a more exciting with waterfalls and the rooftop walkways. The whole environment is so lush and green. There was also some flowers made out of Lego, which was funny. The pool on top of the waterfall is a great place for photos. In the end of the trail there was a small exhibition about climate change with a short film. The whole visit was great. There was just one problem: it was freezing inside the gardens. I was shivering the whole time as I only had a summer dress on. I highly recommend to take a sweater with you when you visit this lovely garden."
,,Amazing Engineering feat.,5.0,,You enter the Cloud Forest at the bottom of an amazing man made waterfall. You then take the lift to the 7th floor and proceed to walk along the Cloud Forest walk down to the bottom. The walk takes you out over the building so you can view the wonderful plants growing on the hill. A must for those who enjoy gardening or you like seeing amazing architecture.
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,"The concept of the cloud forest, at the gardens by bay, is amazing. It takes u time to take in the full view as u enter the dome, it very beautiful. Lined with exquisite flowers and plants, it's a treat for the eyes"
,,Amazing place,4.0,,I went here at night. Seems less people than light time. This place is amazing. I love the waterfall here as well.
,,Excellent indoor exhibit,4.0,,Easy access is a feature of all aspects of hte Marinas Bay Gardens and this attraction has full wheelchair access available. There is a long waterfall and a spectacular indoor green wall. A very nice tropical garden & pond at the summit and a pleasant return walk down spiral ramps with excellent district views and vistas of the internal structure well worth the time to visit.
,,Go at night.,5.0,,Experiencing this at night really makes a difference. You can see the mist flowing down over the plants 7 stories tall. They backlight the huge waterfall. Experience the difference in temperatures from bottom to top. Watch the movie that explains what climate change will do to the earth by 2050
,,Wonderfully designed attraction,5.0,,"Both domes at the Gardens are wonderful and worth the admission cost. However, they can get crowded, especially on weekends. The cloud forest dome really does an amazing job of simulating cloud and rain forest conditions and providing a tutorial on the species found there."
,,Amazing engineering,4.0,,The way this place is built is just amazing. It also a great place to get out of the heat and just enjoy the waterfall and plants. Easy to get to with all of the hop on hop off uses stopping here as well.
,,Amazing and well worth a visit,5.0,,I have been to Singapore on many occasions and for what ever reason I never made to the cloud experience. This time I was determined. I'm so glad I did. What an amazing place. I'd bring a jumper as the difference in temperature I was not prepared for. When you walk In there is a breath taking waterfall which sets the scene for a great experience. It's very accessible for all with great access and lost of space. I loved the tree top walk and found the view breath taking. The is a video experience at the end +5 recommend watching this really thought provoking. I will differently be back next time in Singapore. Loved it !!!!
,,Spectacular in the evening,5.0,,"The mist, the lights, the height ... Go in the evening around six pm when it gets dark, it is more mystical and end your visit with the sound and light show near the giant trees.."
,,Unbelievable - do not miss this,5.0,,"Explore the highlands amidst orchids, pitcher plants and ferns from the cool-moist Tropical Montane region, complete with a 35-metre man-made mountain & waterfall with stunning cascating plants - a photographers paradise."
,,What a Nice Creation,5.0,,If you visit this place you would realize how nicely this has been made and arranged. You get feeling of forest with one Water fall made inside
,,Quite spectacular but repeat visits don't bring much value.,4.0,,"On first entry, it is quite spectacular with the waterfall and all... and then you get to walk down the cloud mountain which is very nice when all the mists come up. But it remains unchanged since I visited it the last few times... so not very interesting unlike the Flower Dome which has changing displays year round."
,,An amazing and informative dome,5.0,,"This was an absolute highlight of my trip and well worth the money! It's beautifully created with a lift to the top and walkways leading you gradually down to the bottom, with fantastic views along the way. The plants are gorgeous and there's even an incredible lego display! Definitely enjoyable for all the family."
,,Beautiful and refreshing,5.0,,"That was my favorite dome - spectacular view from the sky bridge even vertigo couldn't spoil it. It is very well maintained and splashing waterfall was just great. It was a welcomed refreshment after a long walk in non A/C outdoor grounds.

If you only can visit one of the domes - that's the one."
,,Green and refresh your eyes,5.0,,"Its my second time here, before visit last year with my family. Now with friend, the experience still same. You feel refresh and its indoor with aircon so don't worry no sweating, good to avoid from hot sun. You also could take picture thousand different plant and flower, so bring your camera."
,,Almost like Avatar,5.0,,"Be sure to time your entrance, check the misting session first. Also it's best to visit in the evening around 6pm so that after you have seen everything in daylight, the magic hours will begin. Stay longer until it gets dark for the beautiful view of lit up Marina Bay."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A wonderful experience and amazing workmanship to present such a unique attraction. Breathtaking to see, and well worth spending time to enjoy the experience."
,,Best artificial forest,5.0,,Cloud forest is the best artificial forest ever I ever try. It open from 10AM to 6PM so be hurry if you want to go there.
,,Extremely well done,5.0,,A breathtaking experience. If you visit gardens by the bay the cloud forest is a must . It was a great relief walking around here in the cool conditions. Lots to to see
,,Cloud Forest may be you can visit for some extra fun!,4.0,,It's man made forest big down fall water fall from upstairs over there. Beautiful cool weather maintained like jungle. You can go
,,Stunning,4.0,,"What amazing place. Well worth a visit, although it might be a challenge if you have a problem with heights."
,,Awe Inspiring,5.0,,The Cloud Forest was absolutely wonderful. Absolutely gorgeous and a literal breath of fresh air. I felt like I was in forest on a space station Our group of 3 visited at night and we all loved it.
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,Singapore do things well and raised the bar with this. We did the tour at night and stayed for the light show in the tree tops and would highly recommend it.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Went as a family with our adult kids and they enjoyed it as much as we did. By night amazing would love to see it by day to, you would be able to more of the plants. Absolutely a feast for the eyes and not to be rushed, so go before 8pm at night as we ran out of time but saw plenty. Well worth a visit if you are in beautiful Singapore."
,,Being a keen Gardener I was in the Clouds,5.0,,"This is truly a wonder it amazed me how this is all put together, 10 out of 10 Singapore your best draw card. If you love gardening then make a trip to Singapore you will be inspired you to create your own wonder you will not regret it."
,,Unbelievable!,5.0,,"Indoor waterfall was terrific to watch. The best part is it is air-conditioned, which in Singapore is a blessing."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This is a ""do not miss seeing"" attraction. Excellent and very interesting. Walking around on the sky deck was wonderful.mm"
,,Knowledge about forest conservation.,5.0,,Nice dome with lots of knowledge to learn about forest conservation especially the cloud forest (the forest on the high mountain that same level of the cloud). When you walk in this dome you will feel like walking in the rainforest. Good place for family with children.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"A cleverly designed garden for people of all ages and physical abilities, brilliant! Nice on a hot day."
,,a must visit,5.0,,You cannot do Singapore without visiting here especially at night for the sound and light show. It is superb. Also walk another 5 minutes to the bay for great satays especially before the light show.
,,Lots of discoveries inside the cloud forest,5.0,,"I knew nothing about the cloud forest until I visited that cool observatory in Gardens by the Bay.
The cloud forest offers an informative trip through a real cloud forest. Types of trees growing at different altitudes, kinds of flowers and types of animals living there as well. All this very interesting combined with a nice platform promenade around and inside the cloud forest. It is a nice sightseeing spot to do in a rainy or very hot day (since the cloud forest is an indoor and cooled observatory)."
,,unique place with waterfall,4.0,,"beautiful setup and love the orchid section in the cloud forest. The treetop walk is not for those ppl who are afraid of height Overall with the water fountain, it is a nice place to chill out and enjoying the nice man made forest..."
,,Knockout,5.0,,"We splashed our 3S$ each to get the shuttle to the conservatories, money well spent. The cloud forest dome was a spectacular mix of great architecture, brilliant concept and fabulous planting. The opening sight is a waterfall the entire height of the dome. Mist is released every couple of hours from the walkways and there are other running water features so the atmosphere is coolish and damp. It wasn’t too crowded so the walk down from level 7 via the walkways suspended in mid-air between each level was a really nice experience. Next it was the flower dome and although good it was not the same extravaganza as the cloud forest. The area being planted for Christmas was very much a work in progress but other temporary planting was bright and colourful and the permanently planted areas representative of various parts of the world were fine, some quite interesting. We particularly liked the little setups behind glass of e.g. stone plants with crystals and mini stalagmites. Both of the domes had some astonishingly good carvings especially ones where the carvings were integrated into original gnarled pieces of wood. After a drink we went back into the Cloud Forest and did the walk down again. There were not many people."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Came here at night, it is really awesome and when ""misting"" occurs, it is incredible. Great job for a man-made structure."
,,A tropical garden within a huge green house.,4.0,,"This is a multistory enclosed space full of tropical trees plants and vines. You are inside but you are outside. The whole structure is glass with view onto the Singapore bay and skyline. An elevator lets you start at the top and slowly walk the paths to the ground level, past masses of well maintained flora. Of course there are streams and waterfalls and sculputes. The same ticket gets you into the botanical glass house next door. This is a great place to fight Jet lag or for any other time."
,,Deceptively Engaging,5.0,,This was a thoroughly worthwhile experience. With only a passing interest in plants in general this was a magnificent place to visit. Could have spent hours looking at all the varieties in this unique artificial environment. Entry to this and the Flower Dome is $28 and more than well worth it.
,,Amazing creation,5.0,,"What a great experience to see this landscape design. Highly recommend that you visit when ""misting"" occurs, giving an eery atmosphere - like you are high up on a mountain surrounded by a cloud."
,,Worth the time,5.0,,"The design and educational purpose truly is innovative. The experience is well worth it, specially if you are traveling with school age children."
,,Eerily atmospheric in the evening,5.0,,"I got to the gardens later in the evening, and the ticket clerk recommended the Cloud Forest. I wasn't disappointed, the whole greenhouse was cool and lush, with interesting views, and the air was so fresh. Very enjoyable."
,,Pretty cool,5.0,,"Once you get inside you get an amazing view of the man-made waterfall and you see a lot of plants while walking around. I was lucky to be during mist time, which looks pretty cool. There's an auditorium where you can see a short documentary about what would happen to earth if temperature increase 5 degrees. Very interesting."
,,A Touch Of Cool.....,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest at Gardens By The Bay is stunning. It is also an incredible place to step out of the heat of Singapore and into a nice cool venue to see a tropical highlands jungle up close and personal.

The work and engineering that went into this attraction is beyond belief and in my opinion it was worth every dollar spent to build this stunning place. A nice cool place with indoor waterfalls and jungle streams and more foliage than you can imagine - what's not to love?

I look forward to visiting again."
,,Walk in the cloud,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions above sea level. Cloud Mountain is accessible by an elevator and visitors will be able to descend the mountain via a circular path where a waterfall provides visitors with refreshing cool air.

The ""Cloud mountain"" itself is an intricate structure completely clad in epiphytes such as orchids, ferns, peacock ferns, spike- and clubmosses, bromeliads and anthuriums. It consists of a number of levels, each with a different theme."
,,人口なのに、自然の景色に癒されます。The sound and the mist of the waterfall have a relaxation effect,4.0,,"エレベーターで最上階まで上がり、滝の音と緑の植物で、自然の遊歩道を歩いている感じで、面白い・・・滝を裏から観賞する「裏見の滝」、 下から眺めていると、建物の中にいることを忘れます。 水の音としぶきで癒され、リラックスできました。 ものすごく混んでいるのに、不思議・・・水の効果でしょうか？ I seemed to walk the promenade of nature, My feeling was healed　with the sound of the waterfall and green plants. I had relaxation."
,,Amazing Cloud Forest,4.0,,"Huge men-made waterfalls greet you on your entry.
There are stairway to the suspended transparent pathway which is awesome where you give you a nice amazing view from the top of the pathway.
In the evening when the lights are on, it give you a ""wow"" mode of how beautiful it is in the nights."
,,Amazing walk,5.0,,This is an incredible walk. I would recommend going earlier in the day as it can be hot. Remember to take a bottle of water.
,,Almost unreal,5.0,,"We did not know much about this place before arriving here, but it kind of blew our minds! Very cool and we stayed here much longer than we thought we would. Very cool, almost unreal in a way. Stay long enough to see the fog. We were here late at the evening, very nice! Want to go back!"
,,Not as much as we expected,3.0,,"Huge indoor water fall with foliage and stairway to the top. photo op but not much else. Included in your entry ticket as i recall,"
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,IF you do one thing in Singapore go to the Gardens at the Bay and in particular Cloud Forest. Its hard to describe how large this enclosure is but the Waterfall as you walk in will blow you away. By the way its open at nighttime also and it all looks so much better at night due to the ambient lighting they use.
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,This is one of two domes in the Gardens by the Bay. It is worth paying to go inside. A lift takes you to the top of the dome then you walk down through the suspended pathways. Awesome!
,,The Best Cloud Forrest,5.0,,This is a special life experience. Once you enter the building you know you are in for a special treat It has the largest indoor water fall in the world
,,Quasi Mountain in the City,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is in Garden by the Bay. There is an entrance fee. Once you enter the premises you will be surprise by the waterfalls that greets you. You will go up the 6th floor and walk down the pathway while admiring the varieties of plants, vines and flowers surrounding the place. It's feels like you are on the mountain."
,,amazing,5.0,,"The thing you encounter is a large 7 story waterfall the range of plants are fantastic and when you include the crystal and stalagmite cave it becomes a magical experience, finally add on sudden appearance of thick clouds and it is well worth the money"
,,Cloud Forest - Excellent Display.,5.0,,"We got the hop on hop off bus down to Marina Bay and walked across the bridge to the resort then on to the cloud forest which is part of the gardens by the bay. Enjoyed the display and the walk. Entering the display is great as it is air conditioned and gets you away from the humidity from the outside world. Yes, you need to see it."
,,An amazing green house,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, take your time in appreciating the complexity of the setup. The waterfall is just beautiful."
,,Dont miss water fall and mist.,5.0,,"Water front in the beginning and then cloud mist later on makes it a perfect place to spend the evening. Mist timings are 2,4,6,8,10 PM. Vhead straight to level 6 for beautiful view. Then came down through the walkways built. Don't miss the waterfall point."
,,One of the two wonderful enclosed airconditioned gardens,5.0,,What a wonderful idea these gardens are. Nothing has been spared in the wonderful displays in both this and the flowergarden. Not to be missed in Singapore
,,Recommended,5.0,,One of 2 greenhouse domes in MArina BAy GArdens . It was nice and quiet when I visited and I was able to take my time . Loads of information about cloud forests and the exhibit is just spectacular. A one for all ages
,,Indoor Waterfall!!,5.0,,"Cloud forest was beautiful. The waterfall was lovely and the walk through this indoor, rainforest like dome was great. It was great to spend some time in there and also the views of the city were great."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Don't miss a visit to Gardens by the Bay.The Cloud and Flower Domes are fantastic.this year when we visited chyrsathems were the flower on display. Just beautiful.
,,Wonderful place to visit.,5.0,,"We just loved the Cloud Forest. Waterfalls, beautiful plants and trees and a delight to walk around. Was wonderful to walk higher and higher and see all the plants. Very impressed."
,,A good place to escape the haze.,5.0,,"Singapore was in the grip of Indonesian smoke haze when we visited. This was an Oasis for us to visit when outdoor activity was discouraged. There is a great collection of exotic tropical plants in this exhibition as well as hidden sculptures and idols. The Lego exhibition of insect eating plants was very clever. It was good to take a leisurely walk up in the ""clouds""."
,,Amazing gardens,5.0,,"Wonderful concept of gardens that ascend 'up to the clouds' , both the views from the bottom up and from the top down are amazing. Love the waterfall, the greenery, the bridge. The place was full with crowds of people , yet there is a feeling of peace and serenity,"
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,"A temperature controlled dome with a waterfall to showcase flora of high altitude places, this is both a relaxing visit and an educational experience. Worth the money"
,,Truely amazing,5.0,,"Enter dome and was greated by waterfall as tall as dome, made our way to top and then walked down ramped walkways, absolutely stunning, great views if Singapore from within the dome , spent ages inside soaking it all up"
,,stunning,5.0,,"great afternoon spent going around gardens and conservatories . A must vist ,if you are in Singapore"
,,Exception day,5.0,,"Brilliantly cool and refreshing, beautiful plants. Great educational foray. Easy walking, leisurely stroll."
,,A Pleasant Experience,4.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay experience, a walk through the Cloud Forest is refreshing, peaceful, scenic, enlightening and informative with many photo opportunities and great views of the surrounding area"
,,amazing gardens in the clouds.,5.0,,"amazing gardens that just go up and up, wonderful plants and waterfalls. its quite affordable. Its nice looking down from the bridge."
,,Great,5.0,,"Als part of the gardens by the bay park, a must. Isit, great for picture spots. Walking distance from downtown."
,,So beautiful!,5.0,,This is an amazing construction. It is easy to get around and the plants are lovely. It is temperature controlled so very pleasant in Singapores heat and humidity.
,,Nice but could be better,3.0,,Nice elevated walk above the gardens but quite short and could be a bit longer or extended into further areas
,,Must See the Super Trees Light Show,5.0,,"The light show set to music is absolutely beautiful. Colors change to the beat, and travel to the sky both up and around in different shapes...hard to describe. You gotta' be there. Don't miss the pond with the giant dragonflies as you cross the bridge from the Marina Bay Sands. See the light show at Marina Bay Sands first, and the go up and over to this Cloud Forest light show."
,,"Worth the visit, plan to see the light show at the same time",5.0,,"Good -A water fall in side, nothing more needs saying. Its good to see -Start from the top and walk down under the water fall -Air conditioned Bad -I can see some people thinking this isn't worth the effort as its a water fall inside."
,,The ultimate greenhouse,4.0,,"This is a stunning achievement and a credit to those responsible. I can only imagine the reaction when this concept was pitched "" I want to build a mountain with a massive waterfall & rainforest inside a greenhouse"".
It is so cleverly designed, with surprises at every turn, from PNG tribal carvings to traditional Indonesian totems to Lego replicas of pitcher plants & Venus fly traps.
It's well worth a visit and the perfect escape on a hot day.
My only criticism was that a ticket for a single dome is only available to locals & as we were only in Singapore for a few hours on transit, we were forced to buy tickets to see both domes in the clear knowledge there was insufficient time to do so.
Budget at least 2-3 hours to do this wonderful place justice."
,,A must see!,5.0,,We didn't have time last trip so this was a priority this time. Wonderful plants and amazing architecture. Reasonable fee for entry. Stay afterwards and have dinner and watch the light show on the artificial trees.
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"A man made mountain which incorpoates several sky walks as well as a waterfall, It is wheelchair friendly.. There is an entrance fee."
,,Pretty nice,3.0,,"I've been here twice this year with different people. I'm personally not a very nature person but there are some really pretty flowers here. The whole dome is nicely air conditioned so it's a nice respite from the heat on a really hot day. This conservatory has six or seven levels and it's nice to walk on the bridge looking down on the plants and outside where you can see the rest of the bay area.

I guess for locals it's just SGD12 if you choose to go to one conservatory (and I definitely prefer this one over the flower dome), so it's quite affordable. But if I were from a country with more natural settings, I'd just go home and look at flowers there. Or I would just walk around in thee free areas outside the conservatories because there are already beautiful plants there and there are of course the Supertrees."
,,a rain forest fantasy,5.0,,"The cloud forest is exquisite...waterfalls, exotic plants, towers of orchids, a sky walk and so much more"
,,innovative garden concept,5.0,,"The Cloud forest is a huge greenhouse, with a giant metallic structure covered with flowers that is part of Garden by the bay complex. The best way to visit it is to take the elevator until the last level of the metallic structure and then go down by foot using the walkway, enjoying also the perspective over the city area and admiring the flowers around the dome. There are a lot of tropical flowers (orchids, carnivorous plants, ferns etc).
The metal structure is a kind of structure support for displaying the evolution of plants. On the ground floor there is a short movie presentation about the biodiversity, geology and the environments threats facing our world. Just in front of the entrance you can see a waterfall (the tallest waterfall indoor, according to the presentation)."
,,under maintenance.,2.0,,"it looked very pretty from the bottom, but we couldn't go, it was under maintenance. It was still very very pretty though... secretly - i was tired and glad i didn't have to climb more steps at that time, but it would have been awesome.
Even the vendor lady was extremely helpful, directing us in the right direction to walk."
,,A term's education in an afternoon,5.0,,"Totally creative and thoughtful layout,enabled discussion the whole way round - my son learnt so much and asked so many questions."
,,a must do,5.0,,"this is simply breathtaking and trying to explain how they get a 100ft waterfall inside a glass dome that you get a lift inside the structure to the top - no , I can't explain it .... so just go ...you will not be dissapointed"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"You should pay the money, when you are in the Gardens, it is worth the money. It is a very nice walk to the top!"
,,Rain-forest Wow In Singapore,5.0,,I had a great time at this very beautiful replica of a rainforest. It even houses a huge waterfall as well as hanging gardens.The staff are friendly and maintain the huge place very well. Top marks for- Landscaping Variety of flora and trees.
,,Good design and suitable for family outing,5.0,,"You will feel exactly like entering a rainforest. The man-made waterfall is really amazing. There're lots of orchids, wildlife planted along the ""cliffs"". really enjoy my trip here/"
,,I loved the cloud forest,5.0,,"A very beautiful recreation of the rainforest, complete with a 40 foot waterfall and hanging gardens. It was welcome respite from the haze that had overcome Singapore during my visit as it is indoor. The landscaping and the multitude of plants and flowers from the rainforest was amazing!"
,,Hands down - best garden I've ever visited!,5.0,,...and I've visited a lot of gardens in my time! Mind blowing and an absolute must see in Singapore. The integration of sustainability messages into the attraction is very welcome too. The very sobering giant screen showing the impacts of climate change lingers in your mind for months afterwards.

,,Fabulous architecture and plant display,5.0,,"This place has something for everyone even remotely interested in plants, trees and flowers. The Cloud Forest takes you on a simply walk high over the trees and plants below (an elevator is also available) out across a cantilevered walkway.
A great attraction within a Great attraction (Gardens by the Bay)"
,,Lovely exhibit .,5.0,,It was a wonderful experience to walk through this dome the flowers were just lovely. You take a lift to the top then slowly walk down if need be you can take lift to different levels. This is disable friendly exhibit.
,,A must do,5.0,,"Even for none gardeners,this is worth visiting,28 Singapore dollars for both domes well worth it,no wonder the gardens in general are #1 attraction in Singapore"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Well worth the admission fee discount if you show your Singapore air boarding card , well done to designers of this dome it is outstanding. A must visit"
,,Plenty of Greenery,4.0,,"I visited both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome during my visit to the Gardens by the Bay. Both were worth the admission price of S$28.

The world’s largest indoor waterfall greets you as you enter the Cloud Forest. There is plenty of greenery around. You can also take the elevator to the top of the waterfall and take a stroll along the suspended walkway. I didn’t have any problems on the suspended walkway despite my fear of heights. Best of all, the Forest is air-conditioned."
,,Spectacular! A must do!,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay is such a beautiful attraction: it's an absolutely must do! There are 2 large cooled domes: The cloud forest and the flower dome, both are amazing.

,,Truly a Lost World,4.0,,"I am not unfamiliar with a lot of flora having travelled to many countries. In the Cloud Dome, I saw many varieties I had not heard of, or, thought were imaginary, having been someones fancy when making the 'Jurassic Park' films.
Quite a magical experience for sure.
Refer to my separate review on the 'Gardens' for other details.
You won't be able to visit this dome/conservatory unless you are a non-visitor (from what I could see on the admissions board).
Adult/seniors: SGD28.00 two conservatory pass
Child (3-12): SGD15.00 two conservatory pass.
Definitely worth it.
Make sure you visit the Flower Dome as well as the 'outside' gardens."
,,Awesome feature,5.0,,"The whole concept of this place is awesome! To be able to walk through a virtual rainforest is an experience that should not be missed.
We were disappointed to see the stalactites and stalagmites removed from their natural locations, though! A pity, really to cut them off and effective;y ""kill"" them."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Much better than anticipated. Really impressed, large dome with waterfalls and suspended walkways (watch out if you're afraid of heights). Combined ticket with the flower dome is 28 sing dollars for non Singaporeans. Would definitely recommend a visit."
,,So many plants,5.0,,Great place to see how they grow plants vertically and amazing waterfalls.You can go up to the top by lift and then walk down the stairs.So many pictures we took.Very good views to the outside world too.
,,Walk in Virtual Cloud is Awesome,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is higher but slightly smaller at 0.8 hectares (2.0 acres). It replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions between 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level, found in South-East Asia, Middle- and South America. It features a 42-metre (138 ft) ""Cloud Mountain"", accessible by an elevator, and visitors will be able to descend the mountain via a circular path where a 35-metre (115 ft) waterfall provides visitors with refreshing cool air."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,This is one of the domes in the Gardens by the Bay. It's amazing to see what humans can achieve! They have almost created a mini hill station inside this dome!
,,The lost world,5.0,,"here is the part of garden by the bay
there is the big waterfall front of the entrance
when you walk to inside you can see many plants that show you around and there is many floors you will a little bit cold so pls bring some cardigan with you there"
,,AMAZING,5.0,,This was a very impressive garden to visit. It has several levels with cat walks to view the amazing man-made waterfall. We visited at dusk and then watched the light show in the man-made garden behind the arboretum. This entire area has the atmosphere of a real-life science fiction movie. Very cool!
,,Surprising and beautiful,5.0,,"A beautiful biome full of cascading plants and water, punctuated by imaginative works of art including some fascinating LEGO pieces. Lifts take you up to different levels so that you can traverse the floral heights."
,,Wow!,5.0,,Upon entering the cloud forest dome I audibly gasped. Whilst entirely man made the waterfall is truly breathtaking. Beautiful flowers and plants everywhere. Well worth a visit!
,,If you do nothing else do this,5.0,,"The gardens are all magnificent and you cannot afford to miss them. Inside the cloud is a waterfall and sky walks through the enchanted forest. The views to Singapore are equally spectacular. It is cool and wonderful, a break from the heat outside. Well worth the modest cost."
,,Very nice place for photography,3.0,,There are lot of plants which we didn't see in while world. Its worth visiting once and if you are a photographer then I strongly recommend this place. Well maintained for family trips
,,A lovely cool place to escape the heat!,5.0,,A lovely cool place to escape the heat. The walkway is a fun adventure. And the waterfall is very pretty. This was the best part of our visit to Gardens by the Bay
,,"Very Cool, Poor Value.",3.0,,"I really liked this and would defiantly recommend going if it appeals to you but I did have to ask myself as I was leaving if this was worth it. The answer was yes but if I was tight on money or perhaps went as a large family, I think I would have said no. I went at night and enjoyed seeing the lights lighting up the path and when the mist came it looked so beautiful. I think this and the bay gardens in general would be quite a romantic place by night."
,,Have a head for heights?,5.0,,What a concept. Truly a great place to experience and learn. One of the best features of Gardens by the Bay
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,What an amazing rain forest experience - the plants and the water. Excellent value for money and you can simply wander through at your own pace.
,,Great to see,4.0,,"It's an eye opener to how we are destroying our planet and the ""gardens by the bay"" are all about making changes! Great for Singapore for making a difference! A must see for anyone that loves the beuty of nature :)"
,,Garden review,5.0,,"what a credit to the designer. The forethought and execution is amazing and the ongoing care. We really enjoyed the whole experience. Quite a bit of walking, the night show in the gardens was great and free."
,,Superb experience,5.0,,"Well worth the admission charge.
The waterfall and misting of the plants were memories that I'll take with me on this tour. Some of the plant displays were out of this world Orchids and carnivorous plants. I preferred the Cloud Forest , which gives the victor and experience of a tropical mountain environment, to the adjacent Flower dome. I do recommend visiting both domes."
,,Awesome.,5.0,,"Paid S$16 to visit one dome and decided on the Cloud Forest. Best decision ever! This place is beautiful, and great for a quick escape from the tropical heat of Singapore. Spectacularly curated flora, best explored with their spiralling walkways."
,,Prefer the flower dome by far.,3.0,,"We went to the cloud forest after the flower dome. Its cool but not awe inspiring.. Unique design, very wet and cold! We didn't quite like it. The theme is uncertain too. U got lost world on top, some stalagmites in the middle, facts about earth, facts about the garden by the bay on bottom level and very speculative doomsday video +5 degree near exit.. When i visit garden by the bay next time will explore flower dome more not this one.."
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a great attraction in Singapore. You can easily reach it by MRT (Marina Bay Sands). You can buy single tickets for the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome and the Supertrees Grove walk, or a combined ticket for the former two, and a separate one for the trees.
The Could Forest starts with an amazing waterfall and a walk around the main ""tower"" in the center. Then you take a lift to the top, and make your way back down via various walkways. Lots of tropical plants, and some extras, such as a large movie screen.
If you choose only one of the three attractions, this would be my pick!"
,,Very educational DIY trip,5.0,,"One thing I really appreciate about this place is that it's educational on top of having a myriad of flora. And also how it makes use of sustainable energy, given how hot Singapore is usually.

It's much colder than I had expected. Bring a lightweight jacket!"
,,Lovely place with great design,5.0,,"We went to this place for afternoon walk a long with Flowers Dome.

The designs in this place is very cool. They spent a lot of time and afford to build this place with the nice designs. It's really worth to visit.

Tips :Buy tickets for Flowers Dome + Cloud Forest from agency online at S$38.54 for 2 person. It was hassle free for Q to buy tickets."
,,Great experience at the cloud forest!!!,4.0,,Great experience at the cloud forest. The man made waterfall was amazing. A definite visit for everyone...
,,"Excellent, spend hours here",5.0,,"Amazing, although if you are worried about heights you may want to give this a miss as most of it is high suspended walk ways."
,,IMPRESSIVE,5.0,,"Even though the heat was too much to be walking arround, when we walked in inside the Cloud Forest we felt like it was an Oasis. The dome is air conditioned and a relief from the intense heat. One of the most amazing places, ever.
The ticket is expensive - 20/25dls - but TOTALLY worth it.
Very very nice!!!!"
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,It's just amazing... Overall there are two things which you will like when you visit the Garden by the Bay - one is the Cloud Forest and second is the Light and Sound show at the Supertrees Grove.. The best time to visit the place is in the evening when you can see the light and sound show as well as the Cloud mist... You will get tickets at 19 SGD if you buy them from the travel agents...
,,Superb experience of cloud walk,5.0,,"The waterfall the gardens surrounding it is just amazing.
The walkway gives you a clear view of the gardens.
Waterfall is an amazing creation. You tent to enjoy as much as u see the gardens.
Prefer to go during the day just before evening and come out after sunset that would be the best time."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This is a really great place- a hidden gem and has a magnificent waterfall. Has great views of the city inside this structure and a ""must see"" if you are in Singapore"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The waterfall is a major engineering feat. The misting of the plants is great to witness, for me the carnivorous plant display was the best, along with the orchids & the & the.... Wheelchairs & lifts are available for use in the Dome."
,,Can't say enough,5.0,,"After the heat and humidity of the city, it was a blessing to freeze in the Cloud Forest. Seriously, it was cold in there. But the family actually enjoyed learning about plant life at various altitudes. The outer walkway was neat. And we even got to see men suspended from cables pruning the plant life. You can't help but be entertained and learn."
,,Great Attraction in a Great Park,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of two-domed buildings at Gardens by the Bay. The Gardens are no charge but the domed buildings and the Supertree skywalk require tickets -- S$28 for both domes at this writing. This domed building tries to replicate a tropical mountain climate from ground to the clouds, and does it in a fascinating, educational, and beautiful way – large indoor waterfall you see at different levels, beautiful flowers (orchids and others). Definitely worth the visit."
,,It's a must visit for nature lovers,4.0,,"A water fall with winding ways through forest! The size of the place and sky walks makes you undergo a very exciting experience. The area has been so planned that one can choose to go to the highest levels and then stroll down through the sky walks to reduce fatigue as there is a tendency to first go around the garden and then buy a ticket to get to the cloud forest, therefore already having some exhaustion level!
This place can be compared with rain forest created in California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and infact is bigger than that. However, one misses birds and butterflies. If the same can be introduced, the place can come alive even more!

The combined price of S$ 28 for Cloud forest and flower dome for non-residents appear bit steep!"
,,Bit dissapointed,5.0,,The orchids were not as plentiful as the last time I visited about 18 months ago. But still spectacular garden.
,,Heaven by the bay,5.0,,"A great educational and beautiful place to visit , it's nice and cool too. The shear size of the place is amazing"
,,mystical forest,5.0,,"Go there! even if u dont like flowers or nature, u will love it. the rain forest, and the magical waterfall just so breathtaking"
,,Great flora in air conditioned comfort,5.0,,If you are into gardens this is a must see. A really imaginative Domed forest with lots of ferns flowers and shrubs with major waterfall and easy walkways. Next to this Dome is the Flower Dome which again is beautifully laid out
,,A very unique attraction,5.0,,Very unique attraction. Beginning with the indoor waterfall that greets you when you enter . you are able to walk though a floating Walkway and admire the flowersand Scenery. Not advisable for those With fear of heights .
,,A very comfortable trip,5.0,,"As with flower dome, this is a very comfortable place to visit with its air conditioned environment. My only gripe is the lack of benches for the elderly to rest their feet. The man made waterfall at the entrance is an impressive feature. Truly enjoyed the trip to gardens by the bay with my friends."
,,Wow what a place!,5.0,,"I was truly amazed by this place. They managed to create something so magnificent, relaxing and very informative at the same time. Great appreciation to those who created and look after this place. If I lived in Singapore I'd definitely keep coming back there as this is amazing, and refreshing, place."
,,Feels like being in the clouds,5.0,,"One of the best attractions near Marina Bay! Definitely worth a visit! The clouds are achieved when the plants are sprayed with a mist of water. With good light, it looks amazing and feels very refreshing!"
,,Alpine Experience,5.0,,Cloud Forest Singapore is unique owing to the variety of plants which are not seen easily. The creation of alpine like conditions is indeed novel . Thoroughly enjoyed the great flora.
,,Indoor Garden,5.0,,"Buy your tickets online, that way you get more deal. Great to do in a hot day with your family. Great for people who likes photography."
,,Huge man made forest and water fall,4.0,,This is a huge man made dome and waterfall and green forest are created. It is a treat for eyes. This is one of the biggest and tallest man made water falls.
,,ROUND AND ROUND FOREST,5.0,,Nice to see something different type of forest to experience.we just move round and round all the floors.
,,Amazingly Beautiful,4.0,,"It is definitely one of the must visit attractions in the Garden by The Bay. It's just amazingly beautiful, with all the setup, the design, and the atmosphere. It felt like you're inside a complex of Jurrasic Park that kind of thing in the movie. Hahaha. You know singapore is hot and humid, after all the wandering at Garden by The Bay area, and then you enter this forest, it's heaven.. You can watch they do the misting in the forest at certain hours, check it at the information. Don't forget to take a photo with the stunning waterfall just at the entrance."
,,Impressively Large and beautiful gardens,4.0,,"The haze that's been in Singapore helps this attraction because it keeps the sun off your skin. Going up on the skywalk is fun and you have 15 minutes up there, but there weren't many people when we went and I had plenty of time there. You can also walk down from the skywalk instead of taking the elevator back down and that was fun (take pics thru the plants for a good shot). It's completely safe for kids to go up, and there were many families there."
,,Fully air-conditioned,4.0,,"Beautiful fully air-conditioned forest - mountain and waterfall with trees around it. Completely worth the price - 16 SGD for cloud forest, 28 SGD along with flower dome."
,,Cloud Forest simply superb,4.0,,Your welcomed by a huge waterfall and a chill climate. The cloud dome is beautifully conceptualized and well maintained.
,,Orchids Galore!,5.0,,For me the more interesting of the two domes. A truly breathtaking 30m waterfall dominates the attraction. Get a re-entry stamp and go round again.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,I think this would be the place to feel the experience of hill country cloud forest from a low land in the world. it feels like you are in a real cloud fortes. everything is well organized for this experience. Highly recommending to do a visit this.tour.
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"Super comfortable after walking about outside all day. All different kinds of orchids and heliconias growing on and around the mountain, so bring your camera for about 2 hours of shooting."
,,A vertical forest,4.0,,"Must visit with family! As soon as we entered the dome, the air con gave immediate respite from the Singapore heat.
First thing you see upon entering is an indoor man-made waterfall!
Take a stroll amidst rare and local plantations along easily wheelchair-accessible pathways all the way to the top."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It's an amazing place to visit, I've never seen anything like this before. Really different, interesting and beautiful"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Well worth the ticket price, a feat of engineering and so wonderful. Great for hot or rainy days as the whole thing is in a climate-controlled capsule."
,,Discover the Lost World,5.0,,We bought tickets for the two cooled conservatories of Gardens By the Bay and we first visited this amazing Cloud Forest. You will be welcomed by the magnificent indoor Falls! I was so excited to climb up to the mountain top! Great experience! I will never forget this place!
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,Very beautiful garden - a must visit place in Singapore! It is covered with glass and fully air conditioned.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"Utterly amazing, money will spent. Breath taking views, especially of the waterfall.
Good clean toilets too. Plenty of areas to rest too.

Can easily spend a few hours there. Wear proper clothing as it can get quite chilly in there depending on the weather.

Absolutely loved it!"
,,Great way to spend a rainy or hazy morning/afternoon in Singapore,4.0,,Cloud Forest is a fun and educational walk with the kids. Hats off to the organisers as not only is it stimulating but a great vantage point to view the reclamation of land around Singapore and the construction that has taken place.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Simply outstanding. No wonder Gardens by the Bay have become one of Singapore's major tourist attractions. The Domes themselves are architectural works of art, and whilst I think the Flower Dome and the ever changing floral displays quite exquisite, the truly Impressive Cloud Forest is my favourite and should not be missed. It really is breathtaking. Go and experience it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."
,,The best attraction we've ever been to!,5.0,,"After walking around Singapore for several hours, stepping into the Cloud Forest dome was surreal! From a distance, the large, high dome reveals nothing of what is in store, however, once in side and on to the forecourt area of the 35m high cloud mountain it was just breathtaking, to say nothing of the relief from the relentless heat and humidity and air pollution, thanks to the annual Sumatran forest fires.

The sound of the waterfall was immediately present and calming. As we walked around the base of the cloud mountain the variety of plants was huge. Most were in flower with beautiful blooms. Many others were ablaze with colourful leaves. The display is regularly misted and the illusion of being on top of a high altitude tropical forest is complete.

After ascending to ""the summit"" by lift, the floral display intensified. There's a small pond which is surrounded by many varieties of carnivorous plants - sundews, Venus fly traps and pitcher plants and above them, the continous colour of thousands of bromeliads, orchids and other flowering plants.

For us, admission was free as part of Singapore Airlines stop over package which give access to a couple of dozen attractions for free.

The Cloud Forest is a must do!"
,,Magical,5.0,,"I was fascinated by this the last time I visited - and it wasn't even finished Now it is, and it is what puts the highlight into visiting the gardens - particularly the skyway that connects some"
,,Most impressive part of the gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Here is a weird thing about the ticketing for the Garden's attractions: If you are a Singapore resident, you can get single tix for either of the 2 domes, if you are from somewhere else, you can ONLY by the combo ticket. So, this Cloud Forrest is way more impressive than the next door flower dome, thanks to sheer hight, spectaciular waterfall and high up walk ways .. The climate in there is cool / moist, which is a very welcome change of pace ... very much recommended"
,,"Beautiful, like being on another planet",5.0,,"Breathtaking huge green house with a massive growing centre pillar and a huge water fall to greet you. I was expecting to see a cloud (!) but still loved the different temperatures, beautiful exotic plants and spectacular views from the sky walk."
,,A unique place,5.0,,"The domes are amazing, there is so much to do at the gardens by the bay.The cloud forest dome does feel like a real forest.The Eden Project feels insignificant compared to the domes here.The views from the domes are wonderful."
,,Like A Tropical Garden and Waterfalls,5.0,,"Carefully planted and thought out. Beautiful lush greenery and waterfalls - which we walk behind when going up to the rooftop walk by lifts. A photographers delight, and very inviting in the heat."
,,Disneyland for flowers,3.0,,The technology behind is interesting but in the end it's just an expensive theme parc. The walk is nice but you can see the same plants in the Moisyy forest in Malaysia in wild...
,,Beat the afternoon heat,5.0,,"The cloud dome is very impressive with the huge waterfall welcoming you at the entrance. After walking in sunny Singapore is a welcome respite from the heat. So check out the timing when they mist up the whole dome, it feels like you are walking in clouds."
,,CLOUD FOREST...,4.0,,"This is a must see attraction for all Singapore visitors as part of the Gardens By The Bay. I would make it the closing part of a visit to the Gardens by The Bay. Do this late...and then stay for the light show with the the paid walk through the giant artificial trees. The views are spectacular...even on a slightly hazy day. Also, the most beautiful time is in the evening at sunset and later. Be sure to buy the ticket for the walk through the big artificial tree towers to enjoy the light show and the city lights. Bring small flashlight to facilitate walk through the Gardens back to MRT. Easily accessible by MRT."
,,Excellent Walk,5.0,,"Great place to bring the family and experience something different, you don't really see the cloud is more like a mist or haze, but definitely a lot of fun as you get to walk on platform high up and surrounded by greeneries."
,,Amazing indoor waterfall,5.0,,The cloud forest dome is definitely better than the flower dome if you were to choose just one. The large waterfall from the top to bottom of the dome is the main attraction.
,,worth visiting once,4.0,,"Based on the ticket price this place is worth visiting only once. If you are on tight budget, it is recommended to visit orchid Gradens & Singapore Botanical Gardens instead"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Singapore does not do things by half measure and this place is no exception. The Dome offers the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome and both places are truly breathtaking. The range of plants and flowers on display are simply beautiful
,,A must visit for Singapore,5.0,,This is a must visit to see the different plants and the awesome man made rainfall. The walk through the hill is also good. Really appreciate the innovator of the same.
,,What a garden to visit,5.0,,I heard so much about this garden and am so glad to have had the opportunity to see it... Singapore is truly and amazing place to visit..
,,Magnificent to see!,5.0,,"I've visited several botanical exhibits in my travels, but the Cloud Forest tops them all. Located in a huge biodome, the Cloud Forest greets visitors with a towering waterfall. You begin your journey at the top of the forest and work your way down. At each level there are a variety of beautiful orchids, bromeliads, ferns, and every plant imaginable. I couldn't stop myself from taking photograph after photograph. There's an interesting stop along the way that features stalactites and stalagmites. There are also ""lookouts"" where you can look down at the gardens below or out towards a beautiful view of Singapore. I bought the combo ticket that includes both this and the Flower Dome. Definitely worth it!"
,,A must see when in Singapore,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit, especially the light and sound show. The Supertrees look amazing at night and the rooftop bar at L'indochina in the biggest Supertree is just about wth the S$18 entry free (it does include a free draught beer or house wine though). Get there around sunset if you can."
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,"Even if you are not a green thumb, this is a remarkable attraction. The 30m high waterfall and the winding paths make it a memorable day out, with lots of interesting displays about rainforest plants"
,,Great part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Really spectacular part of the gardens and this is indoors. The waterfall is amazing and the quality and variety of plants has to be seen.
,,Amazing !!!,4.0,,The folks behind this incredible dome have transformed the inside of this massive dome into an Amazon rain forest. Massive waterfall and all !!! I thoroughly enjoyed visiting it and can recommend it highly.
,,It was ok,3.0,,"It's a nice array of plants in an area that mimics their natural environment. Besides the plants and flora there they also provided valuable information about climate change. I thought the video/exhibit towards the end was very informative of the consequences of climate change. I think that last part was the best part (for me at least). They also provide brief information about caves and minerals found on these mountains.

If you're in the area I would check it out. The entrance fee for both domes is 28$ for tourists, no student discounts. But it is much cheaper if you're a resident. It's a nice day trip but if you don't go you're not missing much. I recommend and enjoyed the botanic gardens a lot more then the cloud forest."
,,Visit this Attraction!,5.0,,"You cannot believe unless you go there that men can create such facilities which God has created for us. The water fall, the sky walk, the plants, everything will mesmerize you. We went there in the evening and loved it!"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"My favourite place in Singapore! Loved the engineering, the architecture, the rainforesty plants and garden features all under this huge dome. Felt like being in the movie Avatar!"
,,Waterfalls and Plants. Refreshing,5.0,,"This is tied in with the Orchid Garden. it is worth buying the ticket to go to both. An amazing structure, with winding paths going up the structure, plants i had never seen before."
,,An impressive place to visit,5.0,,"Though the place is artificially built, the mist, waterfall and greenery makes you feel you are in the midst of forest."
,,Nice man made water fall,5.0,,"I like the idea of walking up to the top of the water fall. It makes me feel excited. The tempurature is perfect, quite similar as a real water fall."
,,If you like the nature visit cloud forest,5.0,,1. For those who love nature must visit cloud forest 2. They achieve to give the impression to the visitor that he is really at the mountains in a the forest
,,Wow,5.0,,Nice and cool...many different levels with different themes. Has neat skybridge. Brilliant displays and thousands of plants and trees including orchids and others. I think admission was about $28 for the 2 domes....a must visit.
,,Go here!,5.0,,It's simple. Go here. It is amazing! Various floors to go through. I suggest heading straight to the top then make your way down
,,"Cool and beautiful place, when it's hot outside",5.0,,"You can visit only Cloud Forest, if you want. Everywhere there is shown a set price of 28 SGD for ""2 conservatories"", but you can ask just for one and each of them. The ticket will cost 16 SGD.
Inside the Cloud Forest it's cool. So good, when it is +33 C outside. :)
There is a biggest (tallest) inside waterfall in the world!
Beautiful flowers.
You can spend an hour or more there."
,,Like entering another world,5.0,,"Of the two domes, this was my favourite. On entering, it is like stepping into a beautiful, fantasy land. I'm not a botanist so I can't really appreciate all the different varieties of plants and flowers, but they come together beautifully.
It is a little chilly on the inside, so if you do get cold take a cardigan."
,,Nice place to be,5.0,,"All went good, with had a walk with our little one and it was really nice, beautiful atmosphere with nice scenes and more important, every stop there is a learning about how can we help in having a better world :)"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"the forest is so beautiful, offers so much tranquility. love the place. will recommend and visit again soon."
,,One of the top things to do,5.0,,Impressed as soon as I entered the Dome. The size of the structure itself is impressive but what it houses is awe inspiring. When you initially walk around the bottom park take the lift straight to the top and make your way down using the escalators.
,,If you dont like heights its questionable,4.0,,"Very cool and I hate heights, loved the little movie played at the end on global warming and its effect. Definitely made us think."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Well worth a visit. This is quite spectacular. It is also air-conditioned so makes a great place to get out of the heat. This is the best of the 2 conservatories.
,,A welcome respite from the heat and humidity,5.0,,Not only is this garden very beautiful but the structures are feats of engineering to be marvelled at. The controlled atmosphere inside is very refreshing after walking around the exterior gardens in the heat.
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"A man made rainforest in Singapore, just amazing to see. Even if you don't want to see it, you should go anyway, it is one of the coolest places in Singapore, so take advantage of that and escape the humidity and heat!

Upon entering you are greeted by a massive waterfall, a really refreshing sight. You then begin to follow the trail around the dome, seeing some very exotic sights before you take the lift to the top of this artificially created mountain and pop out of the top in the clouds. There are set times during the day when cloud is visable so ask before entering if you really want to see it. The suspended walkways right up at the top of the dome, give spectacular views of both inside and outside the dome. Whoever planned and executed this was very clever. Yes this is a paid attraction, but the fee is certainly justified. It is a very educational attraction too. With explanations about the plants, species etc as well as having interactive area's. A great place for young through to elderly. You could easily spend hours snapping away and just taking in the wonder of it all. A big highlight of our Singapore trip."
,,The highlight of our visit,5.0,,"Exports you to a different world.. One akin to the movie Avatar!

The entry is expensive(like everything in Singapore) but definitely worth the money. It's a one of a kind experience where you see a full artificial forest in an air conditioned dome.

If nothing else, the air-conditioning in sweltering Singapore weather is worth it!"
,,Unique Experience!,4.0,,"I always knew that out of the 2 domes, I will enjoy the Cloud Forest more. It is a novel idea to create such a mountain with waterfall and all. The cloud forest is 7 stories high. After viewing the waterfall from the ground floor and taking few memorable pics, make your way around to the lifts to the top and wander slowly down the paths. Can easily spend 2 hours in the cloud forest. Should not miss this while in Singapore!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,One of the most random things I have ever seen in my life! We had a lot of fun viewing these gardens. Be leary if you are afraid of heights. . . some of the cat walks can be intimidating!
,,Great view,4.0,,"Very interesting spot! Go there in the morning and you will love it. Webhad a nice walk, realy easy to do."
,,Bird's Eye View,5.0,,"Unlike the Flower Dome, this is quite, breath taking. Nature and technology blend together in harmony. As you enter the dome you will get the wow factory from the water fall. Then wonder around before catching the lift to the upper levels. If you are nervous of heights then this may not be for you, but try as this is a unique experience. Check the website before you visit, as the first day we went the dome was closed for maintenance."
,,Not worthy to come,2.0,,"Compared with another dome - flower dome, it's not attractive. Kind of boring for people to see. Besides, very cold inside it!"
,,A tourist trap,2.0,,A five star effort and may be a futuristic idea. But there's nothing new to see. So I suggest go to Bali and enjoy real rain forests.
,,simply amazing,5.0,,"Out of the 2 domes Cloud Forest is the most specatular. As the name suggests this is a tropical zone and at special times (check website for times) mist gently envelopes the dome keeping all the plants happy and alive. Also check on website for closure dates. Once a month the dome is closed for scheduled maintainance. The dates change monthly so check in advance.
The cloud forest is 7 stories high. After viewing the waterfall from the ground floor make your way around to the lifts to the top and wander slowly down the paths.
Capture the many different varieties of orchard and tropical rainforest plants.
Admire the spectacular architecture of this dome as you descend.
Truly amazing, take your time and expect a few hidden sculptures along the way.
We took 2.5 hours to view this dome."
,,Impressive,5.0,,Visited the forest at night amazing structure. Take your time and wander through all the levels. The cloud effects enhances the experience. The next time we return we'll visit during the day.
,,fantastic layout,5.0,,we had a great time in the cloud forest dome we saw 2 domes together which makes better value for money
,,Amazing and great value sight,5.0,,We did as all do both domes and both a truely amazing. Cloud Forest is great a syou walk in and see the 5 storey water full and the amazing features. Take the elevator up to the summit and just take a leisurely stroll round thro the tree tops akll the way down to the ground level. There is nothing to not like as its a 5 star attraction.
,,Love This Place,5.0,,"This was $20 (Singapore) to get in and I thought it was a bargain. Lovely big array of plants and flowers, a sky high walkway, stalactites, wooden carvings and a whole host of information is available.

Could spend a couple of hours in here and you can get a reduced cost ticket if you do the flower dome as well. There are other things to see in the grounds and it is a peaceful place to visit and the domes are cooler than the outside weather while your in Singapore.

Would visit again if we went back."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Its a part of gardens by the bay... Its amazing... So chilled inside... Man-made waterfall u can see... Amazing... Worth a try... U ll love it
,,Combo with Gardens by The Bay,3.0,,A decent place to visit when u are already there in Gardens by the Bay. Buy a ticket to the top of the cloud forest. u gonna love it
,,The ambiance is very good,5.0,,"It is inside Garden bay and one has to buy tickets to go inside. But when you are on holiday, one should not think about money and visit this beautiful place. They say they have highest waterfall made indoors. when you go they also create mist which gives a special feeling. we actually felt we are inside a forest and had fun"
,,Avatar set,5.0,,Beautiful avatar like set feeling. It's amazing and one of a kind in the world which takes u back in time. It also has awareness on importance of forest for the earth to be healthy.
,,A hidden gem,5.0,,"At first I thought that it was going to be another boring place, just walking around seeing flowers but I was wrong.. The moment I stepped into the place, I was amazed.. Its a must place to visit.."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,This was my favorite activity that I did while in Singapore. That may have been because it was such a relief from the heat. I really enjoyed the way this is setup with a winding walkway taking you from the 'summit' to the bottom.
,,A must see,5.0,,"These remarkable biomes are spectacular in engineering, design, information and gardening. The 6 floor waterfall is beautiful. The variety of carniverous plants in the top floor of the cloud forest are interesting. Take the lift up and then slowly walk down through the forest in the carefully constructed metal pathways that snake around the tall hill where the plants are pkaced. Sometimes you are inside the man made structure viewing statictites and stalicmites, or Crystal's still in their rocks. There are rooms on global warming, loss of farming land etc. It's a very informative and impressive exhibition.

The flower dome is less impressive but pretty and smells incredible with the volume of flowering plants from em around the world. Finding a place to have lunch was near to impossible. There is a very expensive restaurant, Pollen, in this dome. The creative food may be worth it for a treat but not just for feeding lunch to hungry tourists. Pollen also has a tea/drinks cafe but that really is too expensive. It's better to go to one of the coffee shops outside but there aren't many and they're full and the choice of food is poor. The Restsurant up in the super tree is sadly a bit more of a night time place."
,,Try a Twilight Visit,5.0,,"At the top of Gardens By The Bay, are two iconic domes. I decided to go later in the day as I was keen to see the light show. So I can't compare with going in full daylight, but twilight was brilliant. It is just glorious inside how it has all been done, and when the lights all start coming on as evening starts, well, what I can say, very special indeed. I didn't have a choice which dome to visit as the other, the Flower Dome was closed for maintenance when I visited. I felt the entrance price was a bit steep, but felt in hindsight I got my money's worth. I also noticed the perfumed flowers seemed more ""perfumed"" as twilight faded into evening. It is well set up, and the views to the outside of the dome are also great. Lots of photo opportunities! If you go at the time I suggested, you can head on over for the 7.45pm light show, and do it all together! Just an aside: if you go by MRT get off at Bayside, not the Marina stops."
,,Informative attraction.,4.0,,This was a great informative attraction especially for kids. Different environments displayed and detailed.
,,A viewing must.,5.0,,"When the smoke haze is too much to bear, take a day or two to visit Cloud Forest, it is amazing, the variety of orchids and other species of flowers and ferns is mind blowing.
It gets very busy so you have to choose your moment to take photos but it will be well worth it.
The staff are friendly and helpful, there is seating if you need to take a break and the big plus is, it's COOL, you can revive yourself before heading to your next expedition."
,,Waterfall,4.0,,"It was the first time I had ever seen an indoor waterfall (of that scale), the winding path took you up and then down so that you had a good view of all that was to see."
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Enjoyed it very much. Extremely well done and an attraction not to be missed. They have a tree walk accessed by lift from which you a really great view from above of not only these huge gardens, but Singapore City also. The night show produced from many thousands of LEDs is spectacular, The massive landscaped park area housing enormous climate controlled domes for all sorts of plants, and museum, Lots to see,"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,first time to see such place...Cloud forest is something really unique and Singapore has put really hard efforts to make these world leading attractions in their city
,,Amazing indoor garden!,4.0,,"A most pleasant visit, discovering beautiful blooms from many countries. Perfect for photography enthusiasts and family outngs or even for the elderly. Wheelchair may be rented and there are lifts."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Man made garden & eye opener as some are species of flowers can be seen here. A good place to learn about flora & fauna. Worth a visit.
,,Up in the clouds,5.0,,"On entering this display, the first thing I saw was a magnificent waterfall coming from the rooftop. It was hot and humid outside but inside near the water fall, it felt much cooler. The whole Cloud Forest display is so good, beautiful ferns and ancient trees meet you at every turn. There is a lift which takes you to the top, and you can make your way down as you please. There is so much to see and read about, I am sure you could spend many hours there, just browsing and enjoying it"
,,Singapore's Cloud Forest,5.0,,In Gardens by the bay Complex. Thoroghly enjoyed this facility as well. Price for admission includes this facility.
,,Not so wow but average,3.0,,This is average as compared to Flower Dome. If time is limited then visit flower dome and avoid Cloud forest.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Must visit this in gardens by the bay. One it is beautiful. Second the experience is awesome. Thirdly the variety of fauna, is a delight. Rarely do you find so many carnivore plants in a controlled environment. and for kids there is enough to learn."
,,Great way to beat the heat!,5.0,,Amazing structure. Tells a good story about the cloud forest. The engineering required to maintain the cloud forest environment in the middle of the tropics is impressive.
,,Amazing Greenhouse,5.0,,"We visited after a long haul from the UK whilst waiting to check into our hotel. As it arrived early morning we had some hours to kill. The inside was a great respite from the humidity outside. Beware those with cameras and prepare for condensation inside your lenses upon leaving.

The size is a feat of engineering and even with the tiredness it was impressive to see. This also looks amazing at night."
,,My kind of forest,5.0,,"As someone who is not into horticulture, the experience is very pleasant. Lots of things to learn especially knowing this kind of place can be self sufficient. It brings up hope that someday this will be the norm."
,,relaxing afternoon,5.0,,"we visited this attraction during a flight transit to australia, and we took the occasion to visit it for a relaxing time in a hot and haze afternoon. A real break in a cahotic city. Recommended"
,,nice and cool,4.0,,"the place is nice, very cool inside. The tickets are not cheap. Also, a complete walk is just 30 minutes"
,,Pleasant way to pass an hour,4.0,,"Having taken a walk around the gardens we decided to go into the Cloud Garden. It starts with an impressive waterfall and then you spend about an hour wandering in and about its many levels.

It has been done in a really nice clean way and can make a nice break from either the heat or the rain outside."
,,'Cloud Forest' - part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Some reviewers have made adverse comments about poor light, the lack of variety of plants, and the constant dripping water. This is not meant to be a typical tropical rainforest, but a specific type of forest - 'a cloud' forest, or sometimes known as montane forest, variably seen at between 1000-3000m, depending upon the part of the world in which they occur. These forests are quite rare, comprising a disappearing habitat. The temperature, lighting and moisture are all part of this. As another reviewer commented, this is an extraordinary effort to provide an access to a beautiful uncommon forest in an tropical heavily urbanised landscape. It is a magnificent piece of engineering and energy management. It provides photographic opportunities in the hundreds of plants, trees and flowers. Looking carefully, there are many cunningly subtle and beautiful wooden and stone sculptures.
This attraction will not be for everyone, but coupled with the Flower Dome, represents an significant achievement. We spent 4 hours in the two domes."
,,Cloud Forest Sights,5.0,,Amazing place by day and night. A must see place! Easy to access via train. Light show at night is amazing.
,,A wonderful visit!,5.0,,This a is a wonderful attraction. It is lovely and cool in the heat of the day. So it is easy to spend a couple of hours in there. The plants and flowers are gorgeous.
,,Nothing like it in the world,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest houses the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. It like walking into the Jurassic World movie set. Honestly, I was a bit nervous walking on the catwalks because of my fear of heights and being able to see through the flooring didn't help. Nice place to check out some unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests and the environmental threats they face."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Had a lovely visit to Cloud Forest. Beautiful plants and design features in a comfortably air conditioned glass dome. Great way to spend a morning...definitely take your camera!
,,Nice,5.0,,It is quite chill inside here so do bring a jacket ( a light one). The waterfall is very beautiful. But there's not much to see inside.
,,Awesome attraction,5.0,,I was amazed how it was being built. The architectural design and its concept. Til next trip thank you
,,beautiful place to walk around,5.0,,Beautiful rainforest like place in a dome. It is enchanting and blows your mind away. Plants from tropical areas and all beautifully done in this dome.
,,Breathtaking experience!!!,4.0,,Really love the man made waterfall and I enjoy the 5 degrees show a lot at the end of the whole thing! Very worth going and will definitely be back again soon! Easily one of the best attractions in Singapore!!!
,,High and so mighty!,5.0,,"A must do in Singapore. Truly an amazing place. The sheer size of the whole set up is unbelievable. Give yourself plenty of time as you will need time to get through and observe it all, and won't want to leave."
,,An indoor rainforest with beautiful plants and interesting statues,5.0,,This is an amazing part of the Gardens by the Sea - a complete rainforest indoors where the climate is controlled. You take a lift to the top and walk down the projected walkway which might be slightly off-putting if you're really afraid of heights. There are interesting statues along the way and beautiful plants to observe close-up.
,,Somewhat awestruck! :),5.0,,"I was somewhat awestruck seeing this man-made waterfall coming down from like a 7-story hill-like structure with strong, stable curve-shaped ramps attached to it inside a big glass dome. And, stuck on the ""hill"" are green & luscious tropical plants that will give you an unmistakable feeling of being in a southeast Asian rainforest, especially by also feeling ""vapors"" from the waterfall on your body (you don't even need to be close to the fall itself to feel those vapors as the fall is coming down with some force from a high level in an enclosed area that's not too big).

You would go up by elevator to the top level (the 7th or so), check out the cute little garden there with a pond and take in a nice view of the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark seen through the glass wall, then come down from there ""quite effortlessly"" on the curve-shaped ramps. There's also a limestone display of sorts on a level on the way down (not too far from the top), and once you're all the way back down, continue on to underneath where there's a theater showing the effects of projected temperature rises through the decades to the end of this century and another garden (somewhat similar to the one at the top) called 'secret garden' for a quick walk-through. And, going out from there will take you straight to the big gift shop with tons of all kinds of souvenirs.

The best way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Bayfront station (blue & yellow lines), then walk up to Marina Bay Sands hotel and take the elevator to the 6th floor to get to the overpass leading out to above the road beside and which connects with the bridge over the Dragonfly Lake, and once you're on the grounds of Gardens by the Bay on the other side of that bridge, just about a 10-minute walk to the left will take you to the domes (Flower Dome on the left side & this one on the right side). You could get a combo ticket for both, and in my opinion it's better to do Flower Dome first."
,,Cloud Forest - Cool Heaven in the Tropical City,5.0,,"Absolute MUST-SEE during the high humidity hot scorching days when you visit Singapore with your loved ones!
It could save you all the enduring 6-8 hours superbus trip from Singapore to Genting Highlands (2,000 - M) Holiday Resorts & Casino, known as the Peak of the Clouds for inspiring Singapore to transport such romantic cool and wet frosty wonders to another ""Genting"" in the south tip.
Almost all the highland's wild flowers, plants, orchids and a many rare species of ferns etc., have found themselves an ideal sanctuary within the eco-hydro cool humid air-conditioned ambience within this masterpiece of steel & glass structure...
TIPS: Just don't catch cold if you spend more than 2 hours within!"
,,"nice, but gets old quickly",4.0,,great way to educate kids on the rainforest and its qualities as well as the plants in it. not sure how someone would want to spend many hours in there though. gets boring after the first glance.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This place is another good experience. Every level is strategically planned and each level has something different to offer. The top of the view is amazing.
,,Stunning enclosed garden exhibit with great views.,5.0,,Loved this exhibit with lush vegetation and exotic flourishing plants and flowers. Very pleasant air conditioned environment and great views with education about the habitats. Good section on the dangers of climate change that is very appropriate to preserve this flora for the future. Bring you camera!
,,A mountain with waterfalls & bridges in a greenhouse. Fancy.,5.0,,"Its a greenhouse, with a mountain made of concrete covered in plants. Sounds like a bad idea. Its not.

Really good place for a walk around for an hr and the illustrations of the environmental side of the Gardents By the Bay really reveal what this whole area is about.

Go."
,,Excellent,5.0,,When entering one is greeted by a cold breeze and find mist of water. The waterfall is huge and its just jaw dropping to witness it. Really awesome to walk around and go above then walk over the bridges. Its a lovely experience. Not to be missed. There is an nice display of stalagmites also towards the end.
,,Really interesting and good value @$14 Sing. Also great cool temperatures.,5.0,,"For non residents of Singapore, tickets can only be bought in combination with the much less impressive Flower Dome @$28Sing for the two. There are no senior citizen discounts for non residents! The cloud forest is interesting, informative and thoroughly enjoyable. Wort 1 to 2 hours of your time. Some wonderful colourful plants and aromas."
,,Best thing about the Garden on the Bay,5.0,,Was closed on the Monday so eventually got back to it that week. The display of plants is very cleverly presented and genuinely takes an hour or 2 to get around. The film on the affects of global warming near the end is thought provoking. They cram a lot into a relatively small area.
,,Great stunning and beautiful,4.0,,We paid for both of the domes although the flower dome wasn't as good definitely choose this one if your thinking of doing one of them.
,,Cool Clouds Caress the weary traveller,5.0,,What an amazing place. Whilst it's hot and humid outside in Singapore these amazing buildings maintain a cool climate for the plants and visitors. We particularly liked the walk ways up high in the foliage and looking down across the waterfalls. It's truly peaceful and beautiful. My only comment would be that it needs more information on each level to ensure that you're getting the most of your visit. But it is a MUST SEE when in Singapore - if only to get out of the heat!!
,,Great Viewpoint,5.0,,Great view of the gardens and Marina Bay Sands. Best in the mornings and the evenings. A must for everyone!
,,Very good,4.0,,"My daughters enjoyed this more so than me as I am scared of heights. Amazing greenery, waterfalls and walkways if you don't have Acrophobia."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,I just love the way entire place has been set up. The falls plants and rock formation etc. You could have a feeling ob being in rain forest . :) The video about environment is also thought provoking. Nice place
,,So clever,5.0,,"The waterfall and display of the cloud and climbing plants has been very cleverly put together to be both informative and interesting, and really is a wow factor when you walk inside"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A lovely way to spend an hour or so out of the heat. Take the elevator to the top and walk down via the walkways, it is an easy walk and quite a spectacular feat of engineering. You can truly believe that you are in a rainforest. We combined with the Flower Dome which is also spectacular. Highly recommended and well worth the $28 admission price which includes both domes."
,,There's a waterfall in the Building!,5.0,,"Count on Singapore to give you a waterfall in a building! This was a welcome break from the heat and humidity (and the haze when I was visiting). Easily spent a few hours walking around the Dome and taking picture. Positively my favourite place in SG! You will get wonderful views of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Singapore Flyer and the Supertrees!"
,,The way to the future of botanic gardens!,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a must, when visiting Singapore. It is creative, imaginative and rich display, which delights everybody. It is bit cooler inside, bring a long sleeve top."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,Good day out nice to get out of the heat. If your into gardens don't miss this one the sculptures made from drift wood are great.
,,"Cool, beautiful and refreshing",5.0,,Beautiful conservatory with a high waterfall when you entered. Elevated walkways gave you a nice perspective of the plants and set ups.
,,Great Views But Not if You're Afraid of Heights,4.0,,Great views of the gardens as well as the Marina Pard Sands Hotel. Beware if you are fearful of heights the platform sways slightly when people are walking and the flooring is not solid so you can see through.
,,Cloud 9,5.0,,Absolutely fantastic. A must see - just loved it and easily spent three hours there . We don't have anything like this in Australia so make sure you go and take your children.
,,The pick of the domes,5.0,,This is worth a visit if only to see this fantastic structure from the inside looking out. We arrived late afternoon and had the opportunity to be inside the dome as the sky darkened and the lights outside came on.
,,BEAT THE HEAT and Enjoy the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"I wasn't expecting much, but I thoroughly enjoyed an hour in this ultra-cool forest grafted onto a six story central core. Millions of plants and thousands of colors, mixed in with some very dramatic waterfalls, and even a few sights of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Eye thrown in for good measure.

No one should leave Singapore without visiting the Cloud Forest. I'm so glad I went."
,,Cooling experience!,4.0,,"Catch the mist every two hourly, which allow visitors to walk in the ""cloud""!
The waterfall at the entrance is always refreshing in Singapore's humid weather, and always popular with kids. Whether day or night, Cloud Forest (glass house) is always spectacular and ideal for families."
,,Stunning and beautiful,5.0,,"Simply stunning, various orchids, huge waterfall, views, easy access. Don't forget to look for the wood carvings in amongst the garden displays"
,,"the only ""highland"" in Singapore",4.0,,"This is a cool place with an artificial forest and waterfall inside the airconditioned bio-sphere. This place will easily brought us to the highland atmosphere with a mist and forest scent, one of the must visit place in Singapore"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,Well worth a visit and plan to spend a lot of time here with your camera if you love gardens. At the moment there is a Chrysanthemum display that will blow your mind with the variety and colours.
,,Worth a visit if you're at the Gardens By The Bay area.,4.0,,Air-conditioned gardens? Only in Singapore! Really nicely done and a lovely way to spend an hour or so.
,,Wonderful Experience!,5.0,,"My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our walk through the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay. From the waterfall, mist and amazing variety of plants and beautiful flowers, through to the educational aspects of the various displays. It was also a welcome relief from the haze enshouding Singpaore from illegal jungle fires in meighbouring countries. A ""must see"" when visiting Singapore."
,,a good feeling forest,4.0,,"The dome controlled climate really makes us feels like in the mid of after rain and on a high ground.. its breezy and cool. the waterfall is lovely and the plants and flowers surround it. we went all the way up to the cloud bridge and it was fascinating. its high (obviously) and the surrounding dome view just beautiful.
its a relaxing visit after a long hot walk outside."
,,Natural beauty found in man made oasis,5.0,,"One of the best man made ""natural"" attractions visited anywhere around the globe, and a ""must see"" for visitors to Singapore. Like it's neighbor, the Flower Dome, this attraction offers natural splendor in air conditioned comfort. I believe it can get quiet busy on weekends and a good tip is to check their website before a visit to make sure they are not closed for scheduled maintenance."
,,Breathtaking displays,5.0,,"Cannot speak highly enough of our visit to Cloud Forest. The stand out of our time in Singapore. There was something exciting to be discovered at every level, small and large. Suitable for all ages with easy walking ramps and elevators in a cool climate controlled dome. I have amazing photo memories."
,,Its a wonder,5.0,,Here's a quick visit to an indoor forest. Worth the visit and an impressive effort. Watch out for the lego plants blending in
,,Not seen anything like it but a bit underwhelming,3.0,,"Impressive construction and idea but not as good as the flower dome. I found it it a bit underwhelming and repetitive. Perhaps season was also wrong as not a lot was in flower, certainly no orchids in evidence anywhere, so it may be more interesting at another time of year."
,,A must do,5.0,,Really outstanding attraction. Nice and cool inside as well so great to get out of the heat. Take a good camera and wander around and soak up the atmosphere.
,,Cloud walk in the haze,5.0,,"This is beautiful, so many plants and such a different experience, such a shame that there was bad haze during our visit and we could not see anything of the Bay on the Cloud Walk but we loved it just the same,"
,,Fantastic Indoor Atraction and Learning,5.0,,"This is my second visit to this attraction within 2 years. The idea of this attraction is really genius. The visitor will have a short but comprehensive tour to experience, to enjoy, and to learn the tropical forest. Various tropical plantation and a waterfall are exhibited in airconditioned dome. The last part of the attraction is a short movie about climate change. Do not miss it if you visit Singapore."
,,Perfect way to spend your morning,5.0,,"Wonderful way to get out of the heat and pollution! Beyond that, it is a serene, well built, clean and simply stunning building. You don't need to have green fingers to enjoy. A peaceful, beautiful and really fun place for all ages."
,,In the clouds,5.0,,"In this conservatory, there is a huge waterfall that gives you the feel that you are amongst clouds in a forest high up a mountain."
,,Heaven on Earth !!,4.0,,The Entry to the dome is simply outstanding .. Beautiful .. Water falls is the show stopper here. Very scenic . But I prefer the Flower dome over this ..
,,romantic,5.0,,"it was beautiful!! we rushed in there and came in around 8pm, an hour was definitely not enough to really enjoy but the place is beautiful! it was a nice feeling to be in a place like the cloud forest when outside is a very modern atmosphere."
,,Amazing Jungle Experience - great for the lungs,5.0,,Another great box to tick when in Singapore (along with the Flower Dome). Brilliant and refreshing experience very cleverly done.
,,MY FIRST VISIT TO VILLAGE HOTEL BUGIS,4.0,,Though I stayed in this Hotel for the First time for one night only still I was very happy in staying there since the Services which the Hotel Provides are above my expectation
,,amazing,5.0,,never seen anything like this anywhere mostly man made biggest man made waterfall i have ever seen flowers trees great no words can describe it
,,Stunning most amazing gardens,5.0,,"Outstanding venue, not cheap but worth it. I would recommend you take a picnic or eat off site as the restaurants are pricey here although there is a mcdonalds near the shuttle tour"
,,Good variety of display,4.0,,Was pleasantly surprised with the space and vast display. Nice get-away from the hot and humid weather. Head here as rainy day activity.
,,cloud forest,5.0,,"The cloud forest was amazing, Singapore have done them selves proud, a must see, I would go again, a really lovely walk"
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Not worth the entrance price, bit like a multi storey car park with plants.....to much concrete. Having been to the Eden project in the UK this does not compare"
,,A big thumbs up,5.0,,"A truly amazing experience. A must see .
As soon as you walk through the doors the temperature drops and you are greeted by a mass of waterfalls You turn the corner and the size of the dome is enormous .
There are several levels to explore and it's as if you are in a rain Forrest , absolutely beautiful ."
,,Fantastic Cloud Forest,5.0,,Just consider a sunny hot day in Singapore and covered with Haze all around. Just entering into this cool spot with your kid can make you all fresh than ever! Nice arrangement and creative initiative to make it a must visit place in Singapore.
,,Great time again,5.0,,Also second time around for this venue and found it just as fascinating and a lovely way to cool off after the humidity outside.
,,Awesome piece of man-made architecture,5.0,,"Awe-inspiring - Is how you feel, when you first enter this place. You have done the main GBB tour, have visited the wonderful Flower Dome and as soon as you enter the main door, the sound of the huge waterfall and that amazing amazonian landscaped small hillock, your jaw would drop to a WOW. Fabulously maintained with the mist blowing in your face. Take the walk towards the top and you would admire how they have created this. Easily the best thing of the GBB.

There are a few outlets which serve some finger food and juices before you get out. Must visit"
,,Amazing structure,4.0,,"Worth a visit just for a closer look at the magnificent building. Wish there could have been an exhibition just explainingbthe structures and how they are eco frendly buildings. To me, that was what sets it apart from just being another conservatory (albeit bigger)"
,,Different,4.0,,Its nice if you like plants otherwise skip it.its very cold so do take a cardigan.Its very pretty and big so do take your time and look.
,,So much to see,5.0,,"Excellent, definitely worth a visit. Need plenty of time as there is so much to see. Must visit every garden there is to see."
,,Good long walk... Can do but not a must do,4.0,,"This is right next to the flower dome and a good place to visit for a family. We went there as couples and we also enjoyed. The manmade waterfall is really excellent and the descent from the top to the bottom while following the watrfall is actually good. Many great views of the Singapore bay from there.

Overall, a good place to visit. You might not be encountering anything new here, but if you have time, this can be a refreshing evening."
,,Remarkable Gardens,5.0,,This is one of the most remarkable structures around and features a magnificent 100 foot waterfall and mighty vertical gardens that change at every level. I love this place.
,,Walk among the clouds,5.0,,"Fantastic job to build such a beautiful place for walking and taking pictures. The place looks and feels like high altitude located tropical forest. Went there on a weekend, and it was a bit crowded from all the tourists, locals, different groups and school kids pouring in. So to avoid any ques I would suggest to come early or to visit during working days."
,,So cold...,4.0,,"First time to see this place and it was so nice.. Perfectly amzing.. With waterfalls, ice crystals and etc..You can see different varieties of plants.."
,,Beautiful planting and waterscape enjoyed from a suspended aerial walkway.,4.0,,"Beautiful planting and waterscape enjoyed from a suspended walkway. Although not particularly extensive, it's a great activity on a rainy day and kids will enjoy the winding aerial paths."
,,Cloud Nice,4.0,,"Be amazed upon entering the Cloud Forest as you are greeted by a huge waterfall. There is more entertainment value in Cloud Forest than the Flower Dome, where you appreciate the beauty of Nature.

In Cloud Forest, be in awe of man made architecture as the huge waterfall transports you momentarily into some jungle you've never been before.

You are then able to make your way up to the top and enjoy a slow suspended walk back down.

This is really good, and do be prepared to get a little wet at the entrance."
,,beautiful gardens of Singapore,5.0,,great place to go despite the haze. well maintained with even 1000 yrs old Olive tree. many different themes throughout the year.
,,Cool way to see a garden,3.0,,"It is a much cooler way to enjoy a garden in the hot and warm city of Singapore. Since the place is air-conditioned, I do expect to see more pretty flowers in blooms, but it isn't the case. There are more greens that any other colours (flowers).
There is a something like a sky walk bridge which is breathtaking as you look out of the dome. Lift is available for those who need it."
,,attraction worth visiting,4.0,,"if you have more than a few days at hand in SG, this man made ecological wonder is worth a visit, takes around an hour and half to cover, taxis from this place can be a bit of a pain."
,,This has the wow factor,4.0,,"When you walk in this place is just ""wow"". Kids will adore it. The novelty slightly wears off as you walk around but it is really quite unique and an absolute ""must-visit""."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Man made falls and forest. You can not imagine how they made this place.Very cold also because it is air conditioned. Very nice place to take photos.
,,"Cool and refreshing, with a certain ""Wow!"" effect",4.0,,"Unlike the adjacent Gardens with a multitude of colorful and photogenic plants from all over the world that seem to be always in bloom, the Cloud Forest has a much more focused concept: it's a cool and refreshing recreation of a high-altitude jungle mountaintop with its vegetation, complete with waterfalls running down its sides. Best for cooling down the kids on a hot summer day (of which Singapore has plenty!)"
,,Futuristic delight,5.0,,"Amazing gardens, amazing structure, plus it's a relief to be out of the Singapore heat! Could spend hours sitting in here. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Garden by the Bay,4.0,,Is Expensive but value for money. Singapore indeed is a clean country and safe too. No worry of your bags while you admire the sceneries
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"This was a really fun visit. Beautiful geo-domes , lush gardens, and nice view of the Singapore skyline. I thought the super trees were kind of silly but the gardens were immaculate and the displays were beautifully done. We did not see the light show they had there at night."
,,Brilliantly Designed,5.0,,"Just like any part of the GBB, this dome is well structured and designed. If one were to plan and purchase tickets to this dome, you may as well do a combo and pay $29 for both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest Dome.

During daylight, it is a nice tropical walk through different levels and paths. Centred with the World's tallest indoor waterfall, the multistory walk is very nice and is like nothing ever seen before.

Other attractions inside include a show of stalactites and towards the end, at the secret gardens, there is 2 separate video viewing rooms showing how the entire GBB is impacting the atmosphere and the ""greeness"" of Singapore and how their their perfectly architectured biodomes contribute to the outer parts of the park.

At night, paths light up along the sides and is a magical walk, although photo opportunities will be lessened as it will be much darker."
,,Fun if in the area,4.0,,"We visited this with my fiancée and family. The first thing you notice when entering is how cool and refreshing this place is, especially on a hot day. Then you see the massive waterfall flowing right in front of you which is a great sight.

The tour takes you to the top of the forest and slowly winds down to the ground. It can be a bit slow if you don't have am interest in plants and biology, but the views are amazing."
,,Walk in the clouds,5.0,,"Have you ever experienced walking in the clouds? Here's a good chance to do that here. Be amazed at the technological skill put to work in the cloud walk trail. It's not only the function but the creative artistic design of the walk.
I have to remind myself that it's all man-made. Close to the image of God as creator. Great job!"
,,Nice Cloud Froest,4.0,,The indoor garden creates a cold atmosphere with nice man-made waterfalls and canopies for walking the top of the structure.
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit. Check if open as it closes 1 day a month fo maintenance. great specticle cool environment beautiful plants. A must to see in Singapore
,,Expensive but well worth it,5.0,,"The place is incredible. The atmosphere, the view, the plants..... Plus, it is a cool place (refreshingly cool in the hot Singapore air). Go !!"
,,"nice path way, fresh air",5.0,,"Love it!!! If you need to choose one dome between and forest, make this first. I can feel the fresh air inside. Also the structure of steel path way is fabulous!!!"
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Blown away by this within the Gardens by the Bay. Note you can buy individual tickets for either the Cloud Forest (or the other conservatory) if you wish but this is not advertised on the screen at the ticket office.

Great concept and realisation within the Cloud Forest and a thoroughly enjoyable visit."
,,Stunning a must Visit,5.0,,"This is a stunning attraction, the temperature & cloud mist make it a wonderful place to visit especially in the hotter part of the day. What has been created is a stunning wondrous environment, from the waterfall to the sky walks giving closeup views of these magnificent rain-forest plants.
This is a world unique attraction & a must for every visitor to Singapore. We purchased the book & Video from the shop as our photo's did not do justice to this attraction.
A great educational experience for parents to show children.
Simply Wonderful"
,,go and check this place out,4.0,,the great waterfall will greets you first at the entrance. generally with cool climate plants. Interesting. go and check this place out
,,This is a must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Spent a few hours here. Amazing and spectacular place to visit in Singapore. It is definitely worth it to spend the 5 SGD to go up to the top catwalk and see the Cloud Forest from up high. The views are incredible and well worth it. The have a restaurant in the center ""tree."" Unfortunately, it was all booked by the time I got there. I really would have liked to eat dinner there also. I looked at the menu and it seemed very reasonable."
,,nice forest,5.0,,Cloud forest made me feel that I am in the middle of a real forest. They have a nice waterfall . It is a perfect rainy day activity for the all family.
,,do visit,5.0,,Fantastic experience and so similar to the real thing. Allow plenty of time to fully appreciate the experience.
,,A must,5.0,,This is inside one of the domes. There is a high water fall .different colours highlighted them to look amazing . The water droplets falling on you gives an amazing feeling .
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Well worth it! As soon as you walk in you are caught up by the dome. Take your time to wander & appreciate the plants & carvings, & if you don't like heights it is ok to still go the the top, which is quite enclosed - you don't need to go on the walkways. The design is great, the plants, especially the orchids, are beautiful. Really glad we went - thank you for all the work in maintaining it so wonderfully."
,,"Nature created under the Dome, Nice place to Visit",5.0,,"This place is for the people who don't like to go on trekking in forests and doing adventures, but still like to enjoy the beauty of Cloud forests right at the heart of Singapore. You can access each level through Lifts and is accessible by Wheel Chair. I suggest to visit Cloud forest during day time to be more Eye feasting due to Day light."
,,It was like another small world inside,4.0,,"The temperature inside the Cloud Forest dome is chilly, approximately 20 degrees Celsius. The mist and waterfall is absolutely beautiful and the view from the highest bridge is amazing.
There is a lift going up and down the dome so even the disabled, elderly, or those with strollers/prams could go in and enjoy. Stairs are also an option.
However, I would have loved it more if there were more interactive features inside.
Other than that, my family and I enjoyed our time thoroughly. It is also much more worth it if you were to buy tickets to enter both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest rather than just buying a ticket to enter just 1 dome."
,,Like being in a rainforest,5.0,,"Truly beautiful and extremely well kept. If you're a plant lover, you won't want to miss this. Feels like you've stepped into a scene from Avatar."
,,Lakwatsera SA Singapore,4.0,,Nice area of Singapore.. Cold inside.. Lots of moist around the area.. Also on the 3rd level you'll see the giant caricature of mountains..
,,Admire nature in the middle of the busy city,5.0,,"This is one of many places for contemplation of nature in the middle of the city. Time flies while you are indoors admiring vegetation from many countries and learning along the way. Kids learn a lot. The views form every level are stunning, as the architecture allows you to view city landmarks through the many windows. No food allowed indoors but there are food outlets when you get out. Worth spending at least a couple of hours."
,,Visit to Marina Bay,4.0,,"Really interesting display. You are taken to the top, simulating a forest in the clouds and then you work your way down to the forrest floor. get a combined ticket with the flower dome"
,,Seriously mind blowing,5.0,,"This is one of the best attractions I've seen. The waterfall, and to be able to go right to the top of this amazing 'mountain' and see all the amazing orchids and plants up close Well worth the visit"
,,Cool time with son,5.0,,I took my son into this and he had such a great time. It was so beautiful and cool inside. Lots of different specie of plants and flowers.
,,"Great place for a leisurely walk, great views, and to cool down!",5.0,,"I enjoyed Cloud Forest much more than the flower dome.. which to me had a lot of beautiful flowers, but just not as interesting as Cloud Forest. It's nice that the domes are nice and cool since it's so hot in Singapore! And amazingly, none of the domes are air-conditioned with it being so cool (it's the perfect temperature to cool down)!

If you plan to stop by Gardens by the Bay after a day of shopping or doing other things, be sure to put your things in the lockers! It was super convenient since my boyfriend and I had our backpacks.

When you first enter the dome, you see an amazing man-made waterfall which is pretty cool. I went there twice and even the second time I enjoyed it The railings/walk are pretty stable and steady but it IS quite high especially when you look down! Just something to remember if you're afraid of heights.

Cloud Forest is a MUST-see when at Singapore! Would recommend for anyone visiting. Lots and lots of cool photo-opportunities since it looks amazing!"
,,Enchanting,5.0,,An enchanting escape from the hustle and bustle. We went at twilight and stayed for the brief but lovely music and light show at 7.45pm. Take the time to wander around the garden paths. The time up on the elevated pathway is limited to 15 mins but they are a lovely 15 minutes! Just don't buy your ice-cream just before you are about to go on this bit as it's not allowed.
,,Incredibly beautiful and interesting,4.0,,This place is very impressive both in terms as a beautiful tourist attraction and a feat in engineering and science.
,,It's amazing what can be done,5.0,,This amazing place is a wonderful spot to wander about and see the amazing features that have been created here.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This place is a must see! Cool architecture and great place to think especially for those travelling alone. The place is not as colorful as the flower dome but the whole place is still awesome. It's like unfolding mystery as you go through each area.
,,Not to be missed while at the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The whole Gardens in the Bay is an amazing experience and the Cloud Forest dome is one of the highlights. Not to be missed.

Go up to level 6 and then walk up to level 7 and then make your way down. The top walkway may be a problem for people scared of heights but the lower levels should be fine."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I'll admit I wasn't thrilled about visiting this (or the Garden next door) but I was more than pleasantly surprised. There's educational stops for the kids, beautiful views, and the suspended walkways make for some amazing photo ops!"
,,Amazing indoor forest,5.0,,"Amazingly done up forest, waterfall, and scenic bridges. Definitely recommended. Takes about 60-90min to go through entire attraction so plan accordingly especially if going around 5pm (sunset around 7pm). In my opinion better during day hours."
,,Marvelous vertical gardens,5.0,,A truly remarkable layout for a collection of plants. You use the walkways to get from level to level. A marvelous artificial cliff/waterfall structure.
,,Quite Lovely,4.0,,"I had wondered about an indoor waterfall but this attraction is almost indescribable with its huge man made mountain that has water pouring over it. The mountain has been covered with greenery and flowering plants, and a walkway has been built so you can not only walk behind the waterfall but also outside of it along a pathway that takes you around and around going higher and higher. Quite amazing, not quite as good as God does, but not bad for man."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Singapore do man made attractions wonderfully, quality all the way, hard to believe how wonderful it is"
,,Visit to the cloud forest,5.0,,High we had an amazing time here. Its a great family/couples to do in Singapore. We were highly impressed. Staff were very helpful. And the views breathtaking. Good value and fun. The lego plants and spider surprised. The waterfalls as you enter set up tje whole adventure.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Fantastic place to spend a couple of hours, take a cloud walk 50 odd meters above the ground, view the waterfall from above or from below, check out the exotic plants, just enjoy the place."

,,Astounding!,5.0,,"As soon as you walk in your in awe ! feels like you've gone back in time, has a jurassic park feel....amazing !"
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,Spectacular cloud forest. A superb experience to live with the fammily members. to redo if any visit to the city.
,,Great place...Must visit,5.0,,"Another masterpiece in Singapore where one can experience clouds,falls and sky walk amidst flowers, trees."
,,What an experience!,5.0,,"This is an amazing place to visit, if you are scared of heights/walkways in the air, then this is a test of faith, as I am terrified of both, but I did manage to walk both the top walk ways, these lead to awesome views of the bay.
The cloud is full of wonderful varieties of plants and flowers, some I have never seen before, even on nat geo!!
The cloud is air conditioned and is lovely cool temperature, and when they mist the cloud of plants its cooling for both you and the plants.
There is lots of information on each level, which is dedicated to different types of nature.
There are lifts and escalators readily available and the waterfall when you first enter if breath-taking!
A must to see!"
,,WOW,5.0,,Wow what a fantastic place to visit. The thought that has gone into this attraction is staggering. The waterfalls are amazing.
,,a cool change,5.0,,"after being outside in the humidity, it was lovely to go inside and view the wonderful variety of plants from around the world"
,,Cool experience under the hot weather,5.0,,"Wonderful visit in the hot weather of Singapore. Temperature inside the dome is so comfortable and the landscape is nicely design. The waterfall near the entrance is magnificent, as well as the view from the top of it. Beautiful flowers and exotic plants can be found as you walk along the trails."
,,Cool!,5.0,,"Really cool place, the man made waterfall is amazing. Such a wonderful concept, great insight from the city. Plant life is great, diverse and offered lots of photo opportunities. The walk way is not for the faint hearted, you can see a long way down from many places! Good place to wander round for an hour or so, worth the visit."
,,On Cloud 9,5.0,,"Nice cool 'mist' from the 'waterfall' greets you as you enter the Cloud Forest. Lovely lush greenery in the heart of the city, at the Gardens by the Bay. I like walking leisurely around the dome, with plants and flowers surrounding me."
,,Great attraction for nature lovers,5.0,,"We're not particular nature lovers but spent quite a time looking round the Cloud Forest and adjacent Flower Dome. We found it quite good value at SG$25 for both, well worth a morning of our holiday.

I prefered the Cloud Forest out of the two, although less of a global flora showcase than the Flower Dome, it is more spectacular and engaging. I like the way the paths take you round the entirety of the domes without too much thought, and the combination of signage, nature and education to be perfect.

I do question the ethos of the eco credentials given the substantial carbon footprint in construction it must have used however."
,,Rain Forests for All,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay and should not be missed. The rain forest in all its glory from tropical to temperate, an amazing experience"
,,Sightseeing,5.0,,"Just beautiful, and a great place to shelter from the main heat of the day. Reasonably priced when coupled with the Gardens by the Bay"
,,not to be missed!!,5.0,,"Not to be missed , truly amazing , even with lots of people in the dome you could still get up close to the beautiful gardens and sculptures"
,,Well worth seeing,4.0,,A beautiful area to walk around cost for visiting both attractions at the Gardens was $28 Singapore and well worth the money. Make sure you stay for the free light show at the gardens or you will miss out on a fantastic experience
,,vertical lush green surprise,4.0,,"Really different...the contrast between steel, glass and garden. Wow factor plus as long as you are not afraid of heights. Very cool indeed."
,,"very interesting, just a bit fake.",4.0,,"Interesting experience. Lots of nice plants and flowers. It's all a bit contrived however. It's a fairly typical, sterile Singapore experience. Botanical gardens is much nicer."
,,Misty Journey in the Heart of the City,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of the huge glass domes that can be found at the Gardens by the Bay. I personally like this dome the best, as it feels like a walk into the Jurassic past. A 35m ""Mountain"" with a waterfall flowing down, tourists can journey around the ""mountain"" and admire the plants from a long time ago. They even have a huge selection of carnivorous plants and ferns, you'd feel like you have stepped into the past. An awesome way to beat the heat, the temperature in the dome is really cool and moist, partly because of the everflowing waterfall."
,,Sooo Singapore - a must see forest garden in the sky - perfect place to cool off for one and all !,5.0,,"This is one of the show-pieces from Singapore, combining high tech and nature at its best. A great learning as well as a relaxing experience for one and all. Best place to go to learn about nature, greenery and ""mountain-high"" forests and mists - all artificially created, but looks like real. We went there on a sunny afternoon, perfect place for cooling off and a bit of exercise before venturing to Waterfront Promenade for drinks and dinner. We took the lift to its highest point and worked our way down the walk-ways (less strenous this way), pause at each level where there are information to learn about the different forest species, pause to enjoy the views both inside the Dome and outside views of Singapore from different height-levels as we moved down.
We even had with us grandma in her wheel-chair and it was no problem for her and us as we spent a wonderful 2 hours, taking our time to enjoy this experience with man-created mountain and nature at its best - mist, waterfall, wet and all at cooling temperatures ( 18-20 C ) at different levels. Highly recommend a visit to work up an appetite before dinner, or to walk off that great lunch. Above all it would be a fun place and ""learning about nature"" for the kids (and grown-ups)."
,,Away from the concrete forest.,3.0,,"Quite a unique green-house with ""tree-top"" sky bridges. The ""forest"" is planted vertically ad mist a waterfall. I question the destruction of cave(s) and other natural environments for the crystals, stalactites and stalagmites that were brought in as exhibits in this man-made green house."
,,Cannot look away,5.0,,We were speechless as we meandered through. SO much to look at your head spins so as not to miss anything. Also a most welcome relief from the heat and humidity inside - head to the cloud forest around lunch time (12/1pm) when the day is hottest an everyone else is either at home or eating lunch!.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We did not know what to expect but was very impressed, I have never seen anything like it. The size of the dome is huge and you have a feeling of being in another world awesome."
,,Impressive,4.0,,Wow! Singapore looks like the film-set for a futuristic world! Amazing structures and sights. I did the sky walk through the Cloud Forest with views of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel - recommend!
,,Nature Trip indeed,4.0,,"The location is covered with flowers and greeneries, So if you love leaves, you will surely go gaga inside!"
,,Amazing Forest,5.0,,"Amazing forest, nice walk above it, great plants and flowers. You just have to visit this great place."
,,Mysterious,5.0,,"I liked everything about it. It was cool inside the dome, the way the dome preserved the nature and the stories that were told in different ways."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Truly amazing and enjoyable plethora of vegetation under one roof. The artificial clouds released from time to time add to the beauty. Some people may find the interiors a bit cold for comfort as the temperatures are maintained around 18-20 degrees celcius. Overall a must visit.
,,A cool place to be in Singapore,5.0,,A great place to cool of in Singapore. The Gardens by the Bay are very impressive but it was lovely to be in the dome to see the forest.
,,Walk amongst the forest,4.0,,"Cloud forest on arrival greets you with a waterfall, which is a nice photo place also.

You are advised to take a lift to the top of the forest and you slowly make your way back down to the ground.

On each level you learn about a different part of the earth and theres lots of facts and a movie on global warming and also a lot of information about how the whole Gardens were built to efficiently move and filter the rainwater for use.

Something to keep in mind if you are afraid of heights, as there is some parts that has bridges that you can go out on and see the forest, but there are other options also, like using the lifts/escalators to get between levels."
,,21st century masterpiece,5.0,,A true experience climbing into the clouds with mist floating by. Easy climb on a gradual climb with views out of the glass dome from every direction
,,Wonder of the modern workd,5.0,,One of the wonders of the moder world. If you go to Singapore you must go to Gardens by the Bay and the cloud Forrest
,,Fantastic to make it look natural,5.0,,This was fantastic as well if you don't like heights this is not for you . There was a huge waterfall the plant life was great a real effort has been put in to make it natural
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Come for the mist : these virtual clouds -see attached pics- are created at 4 and 6pm in the afternpon (and some other times I can't remember). We asked the staff who told us the best place to see the mist is level 4, and indeed it was ! This llace is worth it. Couldn't say the same about the flower dome next door which was much, much less interesting despite being more expensive."
,,Walking in the clouds!,5.0,,"The first place we visited in Marina Bay sands was the forest clouds! As we entered the cloud dome we saw a huge mountain a few steps further we were greeted by a massive indoor waterfall. The base of the mountain was surrounded by ferns , orchids and amazing tropical plants. As we walked a little further I spotted a bench and decided to perch on it to enjoy the water fall . There were 6 levels the most amazing was the lost world . As we went higher and higher I felt I was walking on the clouds with the beautiful sky above me! the fresh air and the smell of fresh plants was breath taking!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,A fabulous experience - quite surreal - definitely worth a visit! We arrived just as the mist was turned on. It was quite beautiful!
,,Fantastic views and a great place to beat the heat!,5.0,,"We went as part of our tour of the Marina Bay area one weekend. Me, DH, two boys (11 and 5) and a stroller. I wouldn't characterize this place as 'stroller-friendly', but it was do-able. And when you are spending the entire day out with a 5 year old, you just know it's either that or carry him at some point.

We happened to be in the Cloud Forest during a 2 hour 'rain event' (drenching). The views of the flora inside were rivaled only by what you could see outside the dome. Then it started to rain and just watching the sheets of water cascade off the dome was mesmerizing, and really cool to listen to. It's actually quite chilly in there; I was glad I had a sweater as hearing my teeth chatter always sours me on an experience.

The tickets are pricey, but it's not like this is something we do every weekend. I can't remember if you get a discount if you're a member. This is totally something I would do with out-of-town guests to showcase Singapore without having everyone die of heat stroke. I've been to a number of outdoor gardens around the world and this one is top shelf. Fear of heights could be a factor though - those catwalks are up there.

If there's one weakness to this experience, it's the lack of food options. It was still raining heavily when we completed our circuit and we had to risk life and limb (and near drowning) to get food. It would be nice if they at least had a covered walkway to the food options, or a nice place within the building. They could have a 'sustainable, organic vegetarian-themed' place right there to hit up hungry, well-heeled botany types right after they see all the pretty greenery and views."
,,Fantastic.,5.0,,Every nature lover is gonna fall in love with this place. They have done it so nice that we did not wished to go out of it though it was bit cold but enjoyable.
,,Worth the Money and Time,5.0,,"This place is great place if you like forest indoors. Take the elevator to the top and walk down a top the Big Trees. This place is connected to the Gardens by the bay.

We spent over 5 hours between the two places. The outdoor gardens are free to roam however there is a few to visit the inside gardens and Cloud Forest.

They have a great movie at the end worth while watching about planet earth."
,,Educational and Informative,4.0,,"We all know about rainforests but cloud forest?? At least this is the first time I had heard of this term and it was pretty educational. It is the forest that exists on high elevations among the clouds where the plants can absorb the moisture directly from the mist and clouds. This leads to special adaptations and an abundance among the plants.

The problem - Singapore doesn't have high mountains. The solution in true Singapore style - build one complete with a waterfall and air-condition the whole enclosure to simulate the cooler climate at high altitudes. The result as expected is pretty spectacular - a miniature mountain in the middle of tropical Singapore.

There are walkways around and inside the mountain where you can view the unique flora up close. The space inside the mountain has also been used for several other exhibits like an educational piece on stalactites and stalagmites - rock formations which form inside caves due to minerals in dripping water and a video show on the effect and conservation of these mountains. A model railway is also included to show the mode of transportation in these regions.

Make it a part of your Gardens by the Bay tour along with other nearby attractions like Singapore Flyer, Flower Dome etc."
,,Beautiful waterfall with lighting,5.0,,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands so this attraction was an easy one for us. When we visited at 5-6pm, the garden was not very busy. We were instantly impressed by the waterfall, which was lit up beautifully. It is also very cool inside the garden - great way to escape the city humidity! Taking the elevator to the top then strolling down the dome was lovely."
,,Nice Walk in the Rain,4.0,,"Went for a nice long walk in the rain. Would have spent more time here had we been dressed appropriately for the weather. The lights are beautiful at night. Would have loved to go to the restaurant, but we were short on time. Next time perhaps."
,,Amazing construction,5.0,,"This place was much better than I thought it would be, the building is enormous and it's a 7 or 8 floor high structure covered in rain forest foliage. Lots of carnivorous plants to see and plenty of ferns and large leafy plants. There's a very high walkway that runs around and through the structure too which is quite impressive.

Great place to check out and would highly recommend this. In summer it is great because it's nice and cold inside - escaping the heat is good.

Tip: go on a weekday in the morning to avoid crowds and school groups

Pros:
Stunning construction, plenty to see, size is impressive

Cons:
Gets busier after midday (when the city actually wakes up)"
,,Do not Miss this Place and plane with Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"You will be wondering that to see a different man made climate and surrounding here which is combination of plants, waterfall etc , I have visited 5 times and my best weekend place (I am staying in Singapore)"
,,"Singapore Gardens by the Bay, a tourist attraction that is in the heart of the city",5.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore. A great visit during the day but even special at night. The lighting effect in the Cloud Forest is something special at night, creating a mist as you walk through the ""forest""."
,,Enchanting and cool,5.0,,"It is one of the best attractions and great learning experience for kids. When one descends the 35 m high hill, variety of tropical forest plants can be seen in their natural habitat. It's a different world and worth the cost."
,,Fabulous cloud forest and walkways,4.0,,"Wow ..... What an impressive dome of tropical plants, rain and cloud forest. Take the elevator to the top of the ""mountain"" and stroll down the ramp through the different elevations of vegetation. It's an incredible combination of engineering, design and gardens. Well worth a visit!!"
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,This was a superb experience - really had the wow factor. Similar to the Eden project yet very different. We had so much fun visiting the cloud. Would highly recommend it. The waterfalls are amazing.
,,Beautiful site,4.0,,Must visit place in Singapore to enjoy the rain forest and different climatic scenarios designed for a layman to enjoy this experience
,,A seven story artificial waterfall,5.0,,"The Cloud forest grabs you at the moment you enter the building.
You are greeted by a 7 stories tall, artificial mountain and a beautiful waterfall.

The sky walkways we'll take you on a journey around the mountain to get one of the best views of the city (even through the dome)."
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,A totally different garden concept and lots of fun to go around. Worth every penny! A must see when in Singapore
,,A very different cloud,4.0,,This is unlike anything I had seen before. Although we were there outside the cloud making times the impact of the forest was still quite substantial.
,,Walking on clouds,5.0,,"If you enjoy heights, you'll surely enjoy this one. Walking at Cloud Forest is like walking on clouds. You'll also enjoy the various plants some of which can only be found in forests and mountains. You also might get a little wet when you have your picture taken below the falls."
,,Best lighting show at night,5.0,,Cloud forest is just a forest for me. But it turned out at its best along with the lighting show at Garden by the bay at night
,,Cool!,4.0,,Amazing how cool it was inside! The mist from the falls was really refreshing. Nice place to hang out after all the walking under the sun.
,,A spectacle worth seeing,5.0,,"wow wow wow. a man-made cloud forest, such a beautiful structure. I didn't think I would like it so much but its definitely a must-see for all ages. Not many places to sit to take breaks, but you can walk at your own pace inside. And its all indoor, so it doesn't matter about the weather outside. We combined this with Gardens by the Bay on a Saturday afternoon with mom, had a great time."
,,Cool getaway from the singapore heat.,5.0,,"I really loved the Cloud Forest. It was like a prehistoric wonderland. There are live mini storms twice a day and a really interesting exhibition on how it is cooled, fed, watered and maintained. 100% self sufficient. It is really a work of engineering genius. I won't give away the secret sauce, go see it for yourself. Also, there is a discount for singapore residences. Bonus, buy tickets for both exhibitions for a discount."
,,Heaven,5.0,,"Best attraction was the cloud forest. We opted to visit this in the wee hours and was simply mesmerized by the charm of the sky high waterfall and the plants, the ambiance was simply the best with the mist,damp chilly wind and the darkness. spent almost three hours going to all the places, towards the end they had the 5 degree show, which is a must watch for all, reminding us about our fate.

we also had a trip to the USS where we happen to enter the stupid Madagascar ride, a simple stroll through this cloud forest was a hundred fold thrilling than that the USS"
,,Escape the Heat!,5.0,,This was my favourite part of Gardens by the Bay! The waterfall is spectacular and design of the pathways and skywalks through the mountain is really interesting...
,,Truly cloud forest feel....,5.0,,"Evening was the time we visited....believe me it was really cold.... Chilly to be precise.. But the falls, the top bridge ( bit scary) were ultimate experience... Must visit...."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is a must see item in Singapore.

Entry is $28 if you buy 2 observatories, which for is included both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.

We were very impressed with Cloud Forest. Absolutely beautiful, and accessible to all.

Tip - take the lift from the bottom to the top (level 6) and then you can get the escalator down from each section.

Must see in Singapore."
,,Stunning man made waterfall.,5.0,,"One of the highlights of the Gardens by the bay! You have to pay, but well worth it. The forest stands about 35M and there is a man made waterfall inside. You can walk in the top of the forest which is clouded in mist. Take the elevator up to the top then walk down the boardwalk."
,,Loved the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"My favourite of the two conservatories! So lush, green and full of life! It was beautiful! Shame about the crowds though but not much one can do about that!"
,,not to be missed,5.0,,I suffer from vertigo so was unable to do the high walk but my husband did and found it very worth while.
,,Awesome,5.0,,A must see place in Singapore Nicely done and great way of enjoying a day out It was calm serene and oh-so refreshing Great environmental project!!!
,,Awesome man-made waterfall,4.0,,"Yeap.. Cloud Forest will amuse all of its visitor with amazing man-made waterfall, complete with its surroundings, like a real one. Lucky me, I come from a tropical country which has so many forest, hills, and mountains with awesome natural waterfall.. but if U never ever see one, just come to Cloud Forest to see it in an easy way. Just follow the pathway to explore Cloud Forest in a correct way, even without a guide like I did. It will leads you to the top of waterfall, then you'll walk down like you walk in the cloud. Be brave, pals, it's safe enough! My best suggestion is to enjoy your time and explore as much as you can."
,,"Can we say ""Amazing"" place ...",5.0,,The Cloud Forestin mist. A tall mountain covered in lush vegetation with waterfall showcases plants. Two walkways in the clouds to have and aerial view of the canopy.
,,High up In the Clouds,5.0,,Entry to one of the clouds you come face to almost face with a waterfall. The beautiful mist and cold breeze hits you which is a great change from the humidity of outside. There are 7 level of cloud forest walkway. Each one brings you closer to the waterfall. A lot of beautiful rainforest plantations and beautiful flowers.
,,Calm and relaxing,5.0,,The plants were beautiful and the waterfall was spectacular. It was incredible to see fully grown trees beneath this dome. Really something special to see.
,,A true modern wonder,5.0,,"Nothing can prepare you for this. I don't want spoil it by telling you all the details of the amazing greenhouse, but I will tell you that it is unlike anything you will have seen before. Our kids (7 and 9) loved it too. See it!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is spectacular the way the walkways and waterfalls merge in together in a giant dome is amazing.
Stunning flowers and plants all displayed in a calm and tranquil setting. We visited at about 6pm so got both daylight and a night time experience. Ticket prices were for both domes, allow at least 1hr for this experience. The temperature inside the dome drops by a few degrees so a light coverall may be needed if you feel the cold."
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"Is just a different feeling inside the forest, make you think how would be the real forest, for some instances you feel in a jungle it is worth it the price and time."
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,We absolutely loved this. You get super close to rare orchids in a beautiful environment similar to nature. The walk down from the peak is simply stunning.
,,Man-made Nature,5.0,,A different perspective of showing the intricate and amazing infusion of human intellect and nature. Walking meters above the ground was refreshing.
,,Go before it gets dark,4.0,,We arrived just before closing so the light was fading (they don't use additional lighting). However what we saw was great and well worth the visit.
,,Very well done,4.0,,"Unlike the flower dome this has a feeling of peace and tranquility and allows you to explore the forest and ecosystems very well.

There is a walkway which takes you to the top of the waterfall and winds its way to the bottom.

At the end of the forest you can watch a film on the effect of global warming if you are into that sort of thing. The irony of doing this in Singapore where they are one of the world biggest producers of oil byproducts and the resulting pollution didn't really let me take it seriously."
,,Not much for the price,3.0,,The cloud forest was fine. I would save my money and time for something else though. The flower dome is much better in our opinion.
,,A must do,4.0,,"We brought the tickets as part of a package, well worth the money and a must see if you go to Gardens by the Bay. From waterfalls to lego flowers and fantastic views from high up it was amazing."
,,Great and interesting experience,4.0,,"Discover the culture, history and plants of the tropics. Walk amongst the clouds and enjoy the experience. Indoor waterfalls and a very impressive structure. A great place for the whole family."
,,different atraction,4.0,,"Yes it a different story here, and first I was not sure that I like it, but yes,and I think it will even be better with the time when it will be more growing and more watersupply"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was one of the most amazing attractions I have seen, it was breathtaking at the top with all mist and waterfalls, would definitely visit again."
,,Cloud Walk!,4.0,,"Very educational visit at the Cloud Forest! We really enjoyed the Cloud Walk and the really cool atmosphere within the dome. All the floors have helpful information regarding what the cloud forest is all about. You should try it, especially during the misting hours!"
,,Kind of cool,4.0,,"We were there this February and felt quite pleased. It was well entertained and fresh and, of course, kind of impressive. Though I'm not the botanist-type and wouldn't recommend it to someone like myself, it's a good way to kill an hour or two if you happen to be in Singapore and gotten tired of the endless shopping.

I still give it 4/5 because if you like this kinds of stuff, it's probably quite an experience. Or you know, just.. a cool place to see. Maybe I personally would have tried Marina Sands instead..."
,,Very cool park!,5.0,,The cloud forest was truly amazing and one of the highlights of our trip. We liked it so much during the day we went back at night twice! This must have cost billions to create but they offer it to anyone walking by for free. Very cool park for runners too!
,,A must do!,5.0,,"This is a must, even if you just do this to escape the heat, so beautiful, the walk around the dome is amazing."
,,A must see part of Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay package!,5.0,,If you are going to Gardens by the Bay then the cloud forest is a definite must see. Best time to go is late afternoon or early evening when its still light but will get dark soon. As it is nice to see the scenery in daylight and in the dark when the lights are all lit up.
,,Good experience,5.0,,Expect for the height of walking down others are worth the visit. Variety of plants and flowers available.
,,Nice place to visit at Singapore.,4.0,,Nice attractions in the GARDEN BY THE BAY. Must visit this man made place at Singapore. You will feel like you are in cloud.
,,Very ingenious,5.0,,"It is a rare experience to see the rare cloud forests of sorts working in a dome. Take time , can get busy during peak hours."
,,WHEELCHAIR or not.....A must do...,5.0,,"Felt like we were in the jungles of East Malaysia. Mum didn't even miss her wheelchair, posing in front of the water-fall!"
,,a trip to paradise,4.0,,"incredible place - whereby nature melts with the modern environment ! the spaciousness relaxes you - you feel that you are taking a walk in the open in a huge garden just at your doorstep in spore !
the external structures are stunning & outstaning by themselves & makes spore look dramatically beautiful !"
,,A unique experience,5.0,,"I enjoyed everything about the Cloud Forest dome,the architecture, the views, the height, the water, the trees. It's good to time your visit so you can view the light show from the top, it takes place at 7.45 and 8.45 each evening.
Apart from the uncomfortable sense that this is the realisation of Joni Mitchell's lyric in Big Yellow Taxi, it was good."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,For us the highlight of gardens by the bay kids loved it as much as adults beautifully done well worth it
,,Beautiful garden in Singapore,4.0,,"We have been to Singapore numerous times but this is the first time that we decided to visit the Cloud Forest and Flower dome. We travelled here via mrt and although a shuttle is available (for sgd 2), we decided to walk instead. The day was sunny and hot and the coolness inside the Cloud Forest was welcome indeed! The first thing we saw were the gorgeous greenery and the cool falls. There are a variety of plants to be seen and they are all artfully arranged! We loved going to the top floor and walking on the walkways to see the beautiful gardens below! This is one of the best attractions in Singapore and definitely worth visiting!"
,,Vertical garden,5.0,,"Imagine going on a trek on a mountain in the jungles of India during the monsoon amid dense fauna and cascading waterfalls – This is exactly what has been replicated inside a dome in the midst of a city like Singapore - A man-made wonder, an engineering and horticultural marvel. The whole place is an amazing experience, for adults as well as children, even if you do not enjoy gardens. The view from the top is the best."
,,Amazing indoor forest,5.0,,"Cannot praise this too much, a lift takes you up to the top and then it is a walk downhill through changing tropical forests & plants, amazing forest. Did not see the misting & clouds but I'm sure this would be a highlight."
,,A MUST SEE GARDEN,4.0,,"This place is very nice and on top of it is fully covered buy glass and air conditioned. You will enjoy the water fall scene as you start walking up till you reach the top of the created garden mountain. Before the end of your journey, there is a video presentation on a very large screen to show people of all ages different things endangering the people and the planet as a whole.You may buy your ticket on site or do some savings by buying it through tour operators (like HOP ON HOP OFF BUS) as a package deal."
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"We spent a very comfortable 4 or so hours exploring both domes and the outside gardens.

This was our second time visiting the gardens - the last time over two years ago. Much has changed - for the better.

The day we visited there was a mass display of orchids - the colours and variety were something to see and experience.

This is a must see when in Singapore - especially if you have a few hours to wait before a night flight."
,,Gardens,5.0,,"Truly inspirational it was easily accessible well designed.

Staff were friendly, knowlegible and informative.

Facilities were very good.

Signage provided clarity and maps were easy to follow.

Plants well maintained.

Gift store esy over the top expensive even tho i had the cadh to spend it was a principal thing.

I will return

Paul"
,,"Fun afternoon out, brilliant view",4.0,,"This was a fantastic way to spend a few hours with the children, .and getting a gorgeous view of the city at the same time. The walk through the gardens were stunning and we found several picture perfect moments on the way."
,,Worth the visit!,5.0,,There are 2 domes associates to this tourist attraction. Cloud Forest exceeded our expectations. Bring a jacket since it does get cool and cooler as you visit the different sections/areas of the attraction.
,,amazing,5.0,,amazing . no word to explain. one of the best thing in singapore. with group members of 16 people have visited and every body appreciate.
,,A brilliant not to be missed Garden.,5.0,,This is one of the best gardens you will ever see. Very different and plants from all over the world.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Definitely have to visit the cloud forest dome and the flower dome when at Gardens by the bay. Be sure to make your way to the top to walk along the suspended sky trail walk it is beautiful.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Spectacular views and beautiful gardens. Well worth visiting. I do have a fear of heights and so didn't even take full advantage of the sights.
,,A Unique Place to Visit,4.0,,This is a very interesting place to go where you can have a unique experience. It is very informative and is a place where you can get the experience of visiting a cloud forest without actually leaving the city.
,,Amazing worth the time,5.0,,Fabulous do not be afraid to go up and have a look it is well done and safe it is incredible. I was` so impressed. Would go back again.
,,Be an Avatar and Soar Between the bushes.,4.0,,"This man made forest is nothing but amazing... Make sure to take your time and stroll around in this forest, combined with cityscape view of singapore. It's a vertical forest with waterfall built inside a huge glass house."
,,Impressive architecture and gardens,5.0,,The buildings that house the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are impressive on their own. Inside you'll find a brilliant display of plants from all over the world. Make sure you take your camera (with macro lens) and enjoy the air-conditioned environment.
,,worth a visit,5.0,,very cool area of the gardens... you can climb all the way up and behind the waterfall as well... great for taking photos
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,this is cloud forest really very amazing inside the dome....this is one of two dome in Garden by The Bay...inside have artifical waterfall and make u feel like in tropical rainforest
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great experience! You really get the idea of being in a real forest with stunning waterfalls! I suggest you go all the way up with the escalators and walk down. Remember to go on a business day if you can
,,Spectacular,5.0,,An incredible place to se and visit. The waterfall is impressive and the colours inside are spectacular. Make sure to take a camera with a good macro to capture the smaller flowers. The shows inside are worth watching and if you have time wait around till they mist the garden.
,,"Worth a visit, for sure",4.0,,Great garden located within the gardens by the bay in Singapore. Very big & well thought through. Specially recommended for a walk in one of those very hot days were you want to by in a cool place.
,,An Amazing Forest Specatular,5.0,,An amazing forest in the spectacular Singapore Gardens at the Bay. Plan to spend quite a few hours as we enjoyed the climate controlled airconditioning to escape the humidity outside.
,,Floral imagination goes wild,5.0,,"The visit is one that if you are in Singapore you must experience. Plants grow up the sides of cliff faces and are of a variety you just must see. The waterfall adds a dramatic effect and cools one down. Walking is quite easy and many a wheelchair was seen being pushed around the walkways with ease. Once again my camera did not stop taking photos of the most amazing floral displays. This is another part of the gardens that must be visited,don't worry about the entry fee it's very well worth every dollar ($28 per person for both Cloud and Garden domes)."
,,Gorgeous.,4.0,,Gorgeous. I am not really a plant/flower person but this is great. Everything is so well looked after.
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"If you do nothing else in Singapore you must go to the Cloud Forest at night for the Light Show, it will blow you away."
,,Real good atmosphere,4.0,,Great place especially if you want to cool down from the Singaporean heat. The other dome is not worth for European in my opinion.
,,Nature at work,5.0,,Great place to while away some hours and to see nature in harmony with engineering. One of the beautiful places in Singapore where there is still personal space.
,,Lovely forest.,5.0,,We visited Cloud Forest during our visit to Gardens by the Bay. It's was so amazing. My wife liked it a lot. It was so cold just like a real forest.
,,The most AMAZING tropical garden I have ever seen,5.0,,"Spent more than 1 1/2hrs in the Cloud Forest Dome.
Take the lift to the top of the dome and walk down the walkways slowly and take it all in.
Try to go on a weekday as it gets busy on a weekend.
The waterfall is magical and so high
Make sure your camera is charged up as you will take so many photo's of this paradise"
,,A forest well worth seeing,5.0,,"A wonderful experience of forest under a huge glass dome, prehistoric shrubs, trees, waterfalls in a modern environment ."
,,great experience,5.0,,enjoyed our trip into the cloud forest - great photo opportunity and quite stunning displays. also some information on global warming which was interesting. worth the entrance fee in my view
,,Very interesting attraction,5.0,,We visited the Cloud Forest and had a very enjoyable time looking at all the plants that grow in rain forests. The complex is very impressive and I would highly recommend this attraction.
,,Very clever,4.0,,really good idea. Very good presentation on global warming. Statues throughout were very cunning good facilities for disabled.
,,Very Nice Experience,5.0,,"If you have the time, this is a great experience, especially around 5.45 pm at night time. They mist the place up for 6.00 pm (check times to be sure as these might change) and to be inside during this is simply good fun. And it also provides a sense of calmness. Good to get out of the Singapore heat too for a while. Make sure you go to the top and walk down. Take your time and enjoy."
,,Botanical gardens might be a better bet if you're into orchids,4.0,,"Not been to the Eden project in the UK, but assume it's similar to this. Nice and cool inside with good bay location, although preferred Emerald Hill Road and looking at this historic quarter for free instead. Cool looking building, but wished l'd gone to the botanical gardens instead"
,,So refreshing,5.0,,"We went to the dome in the midday when the weather was so hot. So when we got inside and felt the coolness and the fresh air of the forest, we were recharged. The kids loved the waterfall and the bridge, especially when we got on top of the dome ( The Lost world ). Scary but fun.. Nice greenery and view from top. The misting time made the forest become foggy and even colder. Nice visit for nature lovers."
,,My favourite place in the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This is really well done and the fact you can see the rain forest environment in an air conditioned dome is a bonus. Some of the plants do not look real (but they are, except for the ones made out of Lego) and the clever way you can work your way down from the top on the walkways through the different 'levels' makes it a really good experience."
,,Unique!,5.0,,Flower Dome & Cloud Forest are both very unique creations in typical Singapore modern grandeur! Must see attractions in one of our favourite cities on the planet!
,,Amazing experience at night,5.0,,Amazing expereince.. Just check when it is closed though. Visited this in the night which was a great experience. Well done and allow to be transported to another world. Try night time for this and day time for the flower dome.
,,One of the domes in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Take a journey through tropical rain forest. Walk to level 3, take the lift to the top and descend on the sky walk. At the end, learn about how the gardens are self sustaining."
,,A walk in the clouds - almost,4.0,,"Cloud Forest has amazing architecture .....the sight of the waterfall when you enter the Forest is ""wow"" . The glass walk-way from top of the forest dome to the ground along with the controlled temperature setting and the cloudy mists gives you the feeling of walking in the clouds. The lowest level rain forest comes a surprise as once you reach the ground level you expect the forests are over.....but the dark forest below is a nice touch. Worth the time and money spent ......wont mind visiting it again."
,,Cleverly constructed and very beautiful,5.0,,As part of a visit to the gardens this dome experience is not to be missed. It is also a great escape from the heat as the temperature for the plants is much lower than normal Singapore weather.
,,A highlight of my visit to Singapore.,5.0,,"Cost: $14 SGD

I truly enjoyed my experience at the Cloud Forest in Gardens by the Bay. Very well done and fantastic for all ages. Beautiful flowers, plants, trees and scenery and several photo opportunities. There are seven floors in the museum making it the largest greenhouse in the world (I believe) and it is very impressive.

I recommend this place and I would return here again. Very well done.

TIP: Bring a light jacket, scarf, or cardigan as the temperature is regulated and it is quite chilly inside."
,,Beautiful re-creation of natures best!,5.0,,"Singapore's Cloud Forest is very, very beautiful and worth seeing. The construction and number of trees and plants under this dome is a marvel. What a masterful and well thought out plan, executed beautifully so that others can enjoy the beauty of nature in a constructive and easily accessible way.

I was able to enjoy and gawk at the towering trees under this dome once I had reached the higher parts of the catwalk. To look down upon it all and breathe in the fresh, cool air as if in a mountainous region was just lovely. The design is spacious so as to accommodate lots of visitors, which were all sauntering about, along with myself. Everyone walked about respectfully and in awe.

The man made waterfall was beautiful but to tower above the trees and to look down on them was a sight to behold and one of the best parts for me. Nice design to be able to capture the beauty at such heights and be safe. Safe for kids too, of which there were many.

At the end, there is a slide show called +5 degrees which shows the impact of global warming and the importance of doing something about it NOW before we reach the point of no return. Elegantly designed and narrated, deeply moving and inspiring.

Take a sweater or scarf as it is moist and cool."
,,Awesome,5.0,,The Cloud Forest has a the highest indoor man made waterfall. A Brillant view of the Marina Bay Sands
,,"Good fun, with a wow factor waterfall, particularly good with kids.",4.0,,"Where else would you find a massive waterfall inside a huge glass dome? Walking through the various altitudes you see the different stages of a cloud forest. Beautiful orchids and quite a spectacular structure. Not cheap but worth doing once. Worth taking visitors.

Note that it is quite cold inside so bring a light sweater.

Also there's a impactful film on global warming in the latter part of the visit which is not completely suitable for young children. Having seen it my four year old spent almost 2 weeks sadly repeating that we were all going to burn up and die in a flood soon. She found the forest fire and dead polar bear scenes quite disturbing."
,,Flowers paradise,5.0,,"The selection of plants and flowers were fantastic. The installations were marvelous. You can spend hours in here without noticing... It was too cold inside but that’s Singapore, they love using AC on the max! :-)"
,,Totally unexpected highlight of our trip!,5.0,,"This was the completely unexpected highlight of our trip to Singapore! The whole Gardens by the Bay complex is fantastic, but the Cloud Forest just blew us away - the contrast of amazing plants, the presentation, the air-conditioned 'bio-dome', all against the backdrop of a super-modern futuristic urban environment. Really, truly, I thought I wouldn't care but it was amazing! Don't miss it."
,,Cool in all senses of the word!,5.0,,"The colours, the imagination and beauty of,the place are astounding. The children and adults enjoyed it very much."
,,must visit,5.0,,Amazing view. At times you feel you are in the rain forest especially the place close to the water fall.
,,Experience in Cloudy Forest,4.0,,It's amazing! Well maintained. Have many species of plants and trees. It is clean and a good place to go with family. There is shuttle service to go from Marina bay.
,,Enjoyable attraction,4.0,,"I've seen my share of flowers, and this still was impressive enough. You have an enjoyable walk down from the top. Don't expect too much, though - it's a man-made waterfall and temperature/humidity control inside the dome to simulate a high altitude environment.

The glass dome looks lovely from the inside.

What they could do better is to actually make it more educative in terms of the flora they have kept, I didn't come out very much more educated.

Too expensive for a casual visitor I'd say."
,,Incredible flowers/plants.,5.0,,Absolutely gob smackingly good gardens. You can spend hours just going through the Cloud Forest and then you still have more to see.
,,Beautiful and informative,4.0,,"This vertical garden is like no garden I've seen before. The visit starts at the top of the cloud forest. On the way to the bottom you'll see different species of flowers that grow on specific altitudes and their characteristics.
The gardens look even more surreal at mist time, so be sure to check the schedule at the entrance.
The entrance fee for the Cloud Forest + Flower Dome is 28$."
,,Bay area from above,5.0,,Such a great place where you can see the bay area from above...Recommended for taking nice pictures.
,,A must,5.0,,This was a great surprise to us. It is a different kind of experience . Just go around and enjoy the sights and the atmosphere.
,,"Do come here, with family, or if you got more budget.",3.0,,"NIce place. But too boring. Recommended if you come here with kids and family. But, if you're a budget travelers, go find any other place to spent your SGD $20-ish."
,,Stunning garden,5.0,,"Although I mentioned the Cloud Forest in my Gardens By the Bay review, we thought the Cloud Forest was absolutely stunning. So well done and have not seen anything like this before. Well worth visiting."
,,Wonderful and awesome!,4.0,,"The moment I walked into the Cloud Forest, I am greeted by the spectacular `titanic mountain' of greenery created by the diversity of ferns, pitcher plants, gorgeous flowers, shrubs and vegetation that grow on that mountain. The misty cool and eco-friendly environment was created using running water from the nearby reservoir driven by turbines that are solar energy driven.

The green house effect was awesome and I truly enjoyed the cooling and relaxed atmosphere. The roar from the water fall and the oxygenated environment was so natural created and impressive. It was the oxygenated environment that promotes deep breathing and soothed my pulsating heart and calm my nerves. It was marvelous just like you are in a deep cloudy forest as the mist and cloud pervaded the air around you.

Beside the Cloud Forest and the Crystal Mountain, I was impressed with the exhibition and the slide show on Saving the Earth. Rapid urbanization, industrialization and deforestation have degraded and contaminated our natural environment with cancerous pollutants, destructive chemicals and irritants. Cancer rate has spiraled exponentially.

Shoal of fishes perish in oxygen depleted ocean covered with thick oil slick from vessel tank leakage. The Fukushima nuclear leak contaminated the seafood in the area with added flavor of radioactive toxins. Cyanide powder pervaded the air from the Tianjin blast and injected chemical poisons into the surrounding sea and severely threatened human health. Vehicular emission of carbon monoxide, toxic benzene emitted from plastic and petro chemicals production are threatening the ozone layer.

The human race seem to be digging our own graveyard with modernization and industrialization. Each nation struggles and places extreme priority on economical survival and wealth creation and forgot the destructive impact and imbalance in nature as a result of what capitalism has created.

We are much arrogant to show off our Mercedes Benz and BMW cars then caring for the vehicular emission that produce the toxic carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide that pollute the air.

How many of us really appreciate the beauty in plants, trees and getting close to nature? How many of us really care of recycling, of reducing waste? I think not many of us care and bother about this.

But this visit to the Cloud Forest really provoke a deep thought in me. As I walked out of the Cloud Forest and looked at the haze that pervaded the atmosphere, I was deep in thought. It is time to say no to Deforestation.

It is time that we should go back to nature to love that every tree and plants and create more greenery around us so that the human race will continue to thrive in an oxygenated natural environment without any pollution.,"
,,Pricey but dont miss,5.0,,"Awesome!!! Singapore well known for its landscaping and cleanliness, makes a mark with this one. Beautiful inside, must watch, even if pricey."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"The minute we walked into the cloud forest, we just thought wow! The entrance is so impressive, pictures do not do it justice.
The walk is amazing but it is high so if your afraid, stick to the escalators. There is a different exhibition on each floor"
,,CF,5.0,,Extraordinary Experience. worth visit location on visit of Singapore despite $25 Entry fee. a beautiful place for Nature Lovers.
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,Great place to visit while at Gardens by the Bay. To stand behind the largest indoor waterfall is an experience.
,,Must visit,4.0,,This was included in the tour package that we purchased. And we thought of skipping it after a tiring walk in the gardens. However the moment we entered the enthusiasm levels were high looking at the waterfall and the man made cloud forest. Its a beautiful walk along the structure that is built and the spray of water from the waterfall freshens you up.
,,Worth the visit & walk.,4.0,,"Loved the climate control to cater for the flora from the world. Impressive man-made hill with the waterfall. The ""sky walk"" was a fabulous feature, allowed us a birds eye view of the dome, as well as a view of the garden outside & Marina Bay Sands. There were segments of stalactites and stalactites featured & video about rising global temperatures & how it affects the planet. Great displays. Loved it!"
,,Discover the forest nature live on your feet within minutes..,5.0,,A lovely place to visit with your family to discover the nature & the real live of the jungle & the worlds trees & flowers. The environment was very nice cold place to walk around.
,,A cool option for a hot city.,4.0,,"I am usually hesitant to pay to see plants but this was worth it. The cloud wasn't really around when we were there but the actual garden was brilliant, the temperature was also very nice and cool too so that was welcome. I don't know if I would come again but I really did enjoy this."
,,The waterfall is beautiful!,5.0,,The waterfall is the main attraction at the Cloud Forest and you might get a little wet. But the view is amazing and most people stops here to take pictures. The Cloud Walk is also amazing.
,,Definitely worth it.,5.0,,This was a fascinating look at the plant life. It's also a magnificent respite from the heat. The various levels of the forest and waterfall are awesome.
,,A must see,5.0,,A must see. The better of the two gardens under the domes. Also bring warm clothes. It's a bit chilly inside.
,,Cloud Forest,4.0,,"An attraction which is pretty expensive, even for Singapore, but is very much worth the money if it's your kind of thing. Everything inside is absolutely stunning; nature at it's very finest. Beautiful greenery, waterfalls, a real sense that you're in a microcosm of the natural world. It even has a series of interactive displays and videos that are a lot of fun and very informative. If you have any interest in plants or any aspects of nature, you will love this place."
,,Beautiful by night,3.0,,Nice to watch by night. Use the elevator outside Marina Bay Sands. This is a nice big shopping mall. Take a lake taxi for 6 SG$ to get across and watch the light show
,,Cloud Forest night show,5.0,,"Spent mid afternoon wandering around the gardens and up along the treetop walk, for a reasonable fee about $20 - $24. Great afternoon, had an early dinner and then the lights came on. Great location in the grassed park to view the whole light show. Really impressive display. Then enjoyed the walk around to the Merlion."
,,So cleaver....,5.0,,"Absolutely brilliant, what an amazing place. A mountain rainforest inside an aircondiitioned dome, complete with waterfalls and river. Go you won't regret it!"

,,Must visit in singapore.,5.0,,I will definitely recommend this place as a must visit along with gardens by the bay. The sheer level of vegetation and construction is excellent
,,Excellent glass house,5.0,,"Excellent glass house, the price list only gives you the option of paying for both glass houses, but we asked and paid 16s$ each to visit just the cloud forest. Well worth it."
,,at least 1 hour needed for a tour in this doom,5.0,,I visited this place twice during my short visit. beautiful waterfall will keep you cool and walkway is good to try. must go place as well.

,,MAN MADE AT ITS BEST,5.0,,"Singapore is good at man made nature, sad to say, but they really do create it well. Hats off to them!"
,,Awesome park,5.0,,Make sure you have lots of energy to spare as you need to walk a fair bit to see all the mind blowing views.
,,Cloud Forrest,5.0,,Cloud Forrest was excellent .The waterfalls were out of this world.The plants were excellent .Every thing in cloud Forrest was breath taking.
,,A little disappointing as maintenance seemed to be lacking,3.0,,"As a Friends of the Gardens, I frequently visit Gardens by the Bay (almost once every two months). And I always make an effort to drop by the Cloud Forest as I really loved the temperature in there, alongside the beautiful waterfall. However, I noticed that this dome has not been really maintained properly. Alot of the plants seem to be wilting badly, with the walls on which the plants are hanging from being very dirty-looking. Hopefully, the dome will be maintained appropriately such that it will be a pleasant visit, at least on most occassions."
,,Mountain Inside !,5.0,,"This is a fantastic visit. Easily achievable for all. Incredible mountain, inside a glasshouse dome, with tropical plants all over everything."
,,Unbelievable...,5.0,,"It was just amazing and unbelievable...
Upon entrance you'll see this huge water fall (The Fall) and this huge artificial ""hill"" with covered with trees... A lot of varieties of rainforest trees everywhere. We used the lift to reach level 6, and went down from there...
There's paths that you can walk through at some level, giving you some on the air experiences...
It's cool so it's great even in the afternoon..."
,,Beautiful in the evening,5.0,,"I had no idea what to expect when I walked into the Cloud Forest and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a beautiful conservatory filled with stunning plants and flowers from all around the world. The mist and clouds are fun! Take the time to read the educational material, it's well worth it."
,,Great experience but only from the top floor,4.0,,To experience the cloud forest you must be there at the right time and on the top floor. You don't see anything on the ground floor but for jets shooting up steam.
,,'Down-town' rain forest,5.0,,"It was really lovely to walk through the rain forest. There is a great variety of flora; it's not only aesthetically beautiful, it's also informative (influence of global warming on today's flora and fauna)."
,,Fantastic,4.0,,Walk your self away from the bustling city and find the beautiful and magic forest in the heart of Marina Bay. I bet you'll make hundred of nice picture here
,,misty wonderland of plants,5.0,,Another amazing attraction in Singapore. Jaw-dropping entrance with a beautiful indoor waterfall. We thought this was by far the better of the 2 domes. Air conditioned so great on a hot day.
,,Your heads in the Clouds!!!,5.0,,"Take the time to visit the Cloud Forest. A truly amazing place. I am not big into gardening, but so glad I went to have a look. We went right before sunset and it was so worth it."
,,Futuristic Garden Under a Dome!,4.0,,A futuristic dome with a landscape soaring upwards. Start at the top and take a slow walk down the ramps and walkways. A visit to Gardens by the Bay wouldn't be complete with coming here. Well worth the effort & offers a cool respite from the humidity outside.
,,Lap of Nature,5.0,,"This place takes you to a whole new world of a rainforest, veiled in mist, into the lap of nature filled with many rare flora and fauna and a waterfall!"
,,Gardens by the Bay Cloud Forest,5.0,,"If you are a keen gardener or just like looking at a mass of plants then do not miss this together with the Floral Dome. There are 4 or 5 levels to this ""Cloud"" and you also walk around the whole structure but if you suffer from vertigo , like me, you will not want to do this. Also the grdens extend beyound the 2 domes so give yourself plenty of time to explore the whole area."
,,jaw dropping awesomeness!,5.0,,The plants and flowers here are just so diverse and interesting. So much to see and discover. The waterfall is the best! The skywalk is awesome. And it is the coolest thing ever!
,,Children-friendly Tropical Rainforest,5.0,,My boys loved this place! Full of helpful infographics that help us parents explain climate change and a handful of other natural phenomena.
,,Surprising place,4.0,,"It really unusual - to walk inside the huge glass palas on the suspension bridges around a mountain covered with green plants and flowers. Need to have a jacket, if you don't want to cold there."
,,Gardens by the Bay - Cloud Forest,4.0,,"Totally different to the Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest is six stories of cool-moist lush vegetation grown over a 35 metre tall mountain. On arrival take the lift straight to the top floor and descend via the walkways, which offer spectacular views out over Singapore. Well worth the effort."
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,"What a stunner bro. Honestly, you can't skip this. 28 sgd to do this and the flower dome. Do both. This one is my favorite though. If you are afraid of heights give it a miss!"
,,Beautiful Flora,5.0,,Lots of beautiful and strange flowers and plants that you've probably never seen before. You'll need a head for heights on the elevated walkways. And the highest indoor waterfall in the world.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Fantastic indoor waterfall, walkway around the waterfall and information for children and adults along the way. Mist and plants make you feel you really are up in the cloud forests"
,,Waterfall lover's delight!,5.0,,"If you love waterfalls, you will love this dome. It is a cool and refreshing respite from the Singapore heat and humidity! We loved it!"
,,Must see at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,After visiting the Dome walk over to the Cloud Forest and you will not be disappointed at all. they have done a great job with the rain forest and the other attractions in there and its amazing to see how well a man made garden is so wonderfully maintained
,,"Wonderfully designed, Cool Respite from the Heat",5.0,,"Beautifully designed and a welcome cool respite to the hot summer weather, the Cloud Forest is a great location to view unique floral species and walk around in a comfortable environment. My wife and I went in the evening for a romantic stroll but if you really want to appreciate the flowers, I would suggest going in during the daytime as the lighting at night is not conducive to viewing all the floral species."
,,Impressively done,4.0,,"I probably preferred this to the flower dome, it's quite an impressive structure with fake waterfalls, caves and forest.

Now, I can imagine backpackers being aghast at the idea of paying $$$ to see fake versions of these sorts of things which are readily available to see naturally in SE Asia.

I suppose when you have a little kid who wants to run around in a (cool air conditioned) area and who is wowed by the falls and hanging walkways then it serves a purpose. Pre-kids I'd have never come in here."
,,Fantastic domes,5.0,,We visited here on a hot Singapore Day and the air conditioned domes were a pleasure to be in. The plant life is amazing. The waterfall stunning. I would recommend this to anyone.
,,Nice garden,5.0,,Takes a little time reaching top and it is wonderful coming down and seeing the nature so close. It's along with garden by the bay
,,Best spot to unwind or spend quality as a family,5.0,,"Visited Cloud Forest at least 3 times already and each time it has left me feeling more refreshed than ever...good for family outings or as a dating destination for young couples.
Entrance waterfall is full of negative ions and the walk down the spiral walkway from the top will take your breath away.
Be prepared to take lots of photos
Bring a water bottle along
It's important to enjoy the walk so don't rush forward - just enjoy the present and discuss the various highlights at leisure
For me this is the best way to enjoy Cloud Forest - absolute must for middle aged couples looking for ways to de-stress or unwind!!"
,,Beautiful gardens with the waterfall,5.0,,"I visited last year with my family it is a very good place if you love greenery. We visited @ auround 4:30 pm it was the perfect time.No extra tickets are there it is inculded in the gardens by the bay. Best indoor waterfall with the best Garden, do stay at 7:00 for the lightnings to start for the big trees in the garden , a must see for everyone. If visit by yourself be out at proper time or you have to wait in a long que for taxi if you donot wish to stand in que book the cab on your smartphone."
,,A Short Walk in the Clouds,4.0,,Definitely worth the $5 admission. The only negative is that we were pushed along a little bit by the attendants. The view from up there is so spectacular that I wanted to take more pictures.
,,Don't miss out,5.0,,"Like its sister dome, a must see if you are visiting Singapore. It would make for a nice and relaxing day out for the family or with friends. Many beautiful species and arrangements from the cloud forest, waterfall and sky walk to be enjoyed."
,,Biggest indoor waterfall,4.0,,Fantastic recreation of a cloud forest environment. The walkways are brilliant giving a great perspective.
,,Singapore in a high altitude environment,4.0,,"A nice place to beat the heat! In the dome, they replica how the environment will be like in a high altitude. The plants in the enclosure are also those that can be found in cooling temperature. Overall definitely worth a visit."
,,Quite different :),4.0,,Something different to observe and check out in Singapore. Beautifully put together and gives insightful descriptions of the different trees that can be sustained at different altitudes etc. Also comments on the global warming concerns for plants in the future which I thought was good for the program.
,,A la Jurassic's Lost World,4.0,,"This is one of the more fantastic tourist attractions in Singapore. If you like plants and nature this a good place for you to visit. The architecture is amazing especially the waterfalls. Tip: If you get easily cold, I suggest you bring a jacket/ sweater with you."
,,Indoor artificial hill,4.0,,Cloud forest is a nice escape to experience a man-made hill with its very own summit and waterfall. Learn about the different plants that live in different elevation as you make your way down from the summit.
,,A Walk in the Clouds...,4.0,,"Multi level walks through a rainforest setting.... waterfalls, exotic plants (and air-conditioning!)"
,,Biggest Botanical Gardens I had seen,4.0,,It was a huge and wonderful place to visit. Recommend lots of time to be able to see all the different areas.
,,"If you have green fingers, this is not to be missed",5.0,,"Gosh. If it hasn't been for those screaming kids, I thought I was in the deep forest in the northern parts of earth. Cool, refreshing & greenery all over"
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,4.0,,Highly recommended place to visit for both tourists and locals. Please take the time to visit both the domes. Be prepared to spend about 3 hours. Evenings are better as you will be able to see the place with the lights on.
,,Adventure in an urban jungle,4.0,,"To first be greeted by a gorgeous waterfall was truly a great start. The hanging plants and wild, almost jungle-like arrangement of the plants is a pleasant change from the impeccable display of flowers in Flower Dome. It completes the experience. The walk 'up' the 35m mountain was worth it, especially when you take the Cloud Walk and Tree Top Walk. Not for those with fear of heights."
,,"Was good, but wouldn't do it again",3.0,,The water on entry is very impressive and offers a cool change to the outside humidity. The walk is suspended out over the interior gardens. Never seen anything like it.
,,Beautifully Maintained Gem in the City,5.0,,"Can get a little chilly with the mist and wind, bring a light sweater and enjoy the amazing indoor waterfall and walkways high above the ground. Inside Cloud Forest, you will find unique species of plants and flowers that aren't seen around the city. A great way to spend a rainy afternoon but equally beautiful on any day. Towards the end of the tour, you will be presented with an eye opening facts on global warming which may make you just a little more aware of your carbon footprint."
,,One of its kind,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is quite an interesting place to visit for nature lovers and is a must if you happen to be in Marina Bay area. The descent down the cloud forest is really wonderful and the mist surrounding the forest made me feel like its hill station :).
This is definitely better than Flower Dome which is another paid attraction within Gardens by the Bay."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Probably the BEST garden landscaping I've seen! Climbing around the structure from top to bottom and through the mist and under the waterfall was fun and fascinating. Great for the family.
,,beautiful light show,5.0,,"I went to both the forest the cold doom is very interesting and the manmade waterfall is great to see. You should stay for the night light show which starts after 7pm,"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"A fantastic forest which is actually a dome covered in forest plants and grown in an atmosphere representing a cloud forest. Walking in the cool, moist air with the sound of the waterfall in the background is an unbeatable way to stay cool on a hot Singapore day. I will definitely go again but next time to the Flower Garden and no doubt there will be many opportunities to take visitors to the Cloud Forest but to see all of the Gardens on the Bay. I can't remember the ticket price for the Cloud Forest but I recall feeling that it was very reasonable. Great way to kill time whilst on a holiday or as a local."
,,A world of its own,5.0,,This is not just an attraction but more of an eye opener for people to love nature and understand how its functions. Take time and avoid public holidays to relax and enjoy your journey through this unique experience.
,,a beautiful walk under the artificial waterfall,4.0,,The view from the Top after you take the elevator is beautiful.. The sound of the waterfall is very calming
,,Gorgeous Waterfall,5.0,,"Fabulous way to spend a day , after the Gardens by the Bay.. loved the massive water fall and all the interesting walkways."

It is really hard to describe and they way the have planted the various plants in this way is magnificent.What really impressed me was the height of this attraction.A large variety of plants and flowers on display.
Not to be missed."
,,Nice attraction for great views,4.0,,From up there you have quiet a good view over Singapore. It's not made for people to don't like height as it is quite free and you might notice the bridge shaking a bit when a lot of people walk on it.
,,Amazing,5.0,,You feel as if you have entered a movie set! First we are greeted by a huge man made waterfall and then you end up literally taking a walk among the clouds. Though its indoor i appreciate the creativity and thought process behind creating such a marvel. If fit physically do take the stairs else there is a lift till the top and then you walk down.
,,A cool and misty place to visit in our hot and sunny island,4.0,,"A cool and misty place to visit in our hot and sunny island. The main feature you cannot miss is a 35m man made mountain with waterfall feature immediately after you entered into Cloud Forest.
This place comprises of 6 storeys, you may start with taking a short walk to the the lift and travel up to level 6 (Lost World) before coming down slowly to view the rest of the levels.
There is a crystal mountain exhibition at level 4 and global warming message video at level 2.
There are many different species of flowers and plants , do take some time to admire them.
It is recommended to spend between 45mins to 1 hour for a leisure enjoyment in Cloud Forest."
,,Beautiful Experience,5.0,,A magnificent contribution to the tourist attractions in Singapore. The walk through the treetops is absolutely fantastic as is the flower exhibitions. This is an attraction that you shouldn't miss when in Singapore.
,,Waterfall is impressive but couldn't see what the hype is about,3.0,,"The waterfall is impressive considering it is indoors but wasn't bowled over with the rest.

I wouldn't recommend the place for people who aren't greet with heights because there is a fairly long walk up to the top which is high. There are various points along the way to stop and see the different flowers.

The place does have a lift so it is accessible for all. The lift is only allowed to be used by people who struggle to walk, have young children, pregnant etc ie not for people who are fit and capable of walking."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is absolutely amazing, My better half has a fear of heights but said that it was okay as he felt very safe. Although I nearly lost my glasses at the top when taking a selfie.. oops You couldn't go to singapore and miss this spectacular place"
,,Interesting place well presented,4.0,,Well presented indoor representation of waterfall and damp climate vegetation. If you are interested in garden presentation this is worth a visit
,,In the Clouds,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a terrific feature of the Gardens by the Bay, allowing visitors to see up close some of the wonders of tropical Singapore, its flowers and plants."
,,Got strong knees?,4.0,,I had a great time enjoying the view and the show at the hanging bridge until the attendant drove the tourists to the exit to give way to the long queue.
,,Surprisingly Fun,5.0,,I was with family and did not think I would enjoy this but was surprised. Definitely a fun thing to do and worth a visit.
,,An amazing architectural and plant experience,5.0,,"There was nothing to dislike during this visit. Amazing design and so full of plants. The more you looked the more you saw. Add to that the design of the building, and it was wonderland. Not to be missed."
,,Refreshing and awakening experience in warm Singapore,5.0,,"Very refreshing and nice experience, something you don't see every day! It's like walking straight into a rain forrest. Got caves, bridges and waterfalls. It's easily accessible for people with handicap as well."
,,Another tourist trap,3.0,,"Impressive show of technology and engineering. If you have money and time to spare, why not? Otherwise, just head over to Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve for the genuine face of Singapore's flora and fauna."
,,nice to walk,5.0,,It is very nice place for walks at any time! at the night time it is most beautiful. If you go up it is perfect view!
,,eye opening,5.0,,a must see when visiting Singapore -take your time and make sure you do all levels -if you need cooling down -then sit down at the bottom of the waterfall and injoy the light water spray
,,Must do,5.0,,"If you are remotely interested in gardens and nature, then this is a must do while in Singapore. Inside the dome is a massive mountain with gorgeous tropical plants and flowers covering it. You walk into a huge waterfall cascading down from the top which is stunning.
You can work your way up the top and then back down along the walkways, getting great views from all angles.
We were quite taken aback by the beauty of this"
,,Amazing Waterfall,4.0,,"This is a nice place to visit with family and kids. The waterfall is amazing, you get to go to level 6 and then walk down for an amazing experience. Lots of interesting information available about Climate. This is a must see place in Singapore. Be early to avoid the crowds."
,,very nice attraction,5.0,,"worth to visit , however, inside is alittle bit cold so be prepared :) It is a little bit a short attraction"
,,Great experience,5.0,,This place is amazing. Worth the effort to go to the top & walk down. Climate controlled which is nice. The waterfall is great. It is like walking through a tropical paradise. Interesting information about the environment.
,,Cold and Wet,5.0,,"It was a rainy day and were looking for a sheltered attraction to go to and this place came to mind.

With a 15% OCBC discount, we happily entered the Cloud Forest. My baby was clearly amazed by the gigantic waterfall at the start.

My favourites were
1) the open air walks on the metal platforms, much like the Southern Bridges at Alexandra Arch, only thing this was totally air-conditioned, and
2) the exhibits towards the end of the tour.

The stalactites and stalagmites were not real enough in my opinion.

Overall, a fantastic attraction this was!"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,Make the Cloud Forest a Must See whilst you are visiting Singapore. There are amazing botanical end environmental displays all within the air=conditioned comfort of the Dome.

,,Multistory walkway around a massive rock overgrown with a rich selection of plants,5.0,,"Together with the stroll along the waterfront, garden by the sea, and the flower dome, a visit to the cloud forest makes an extraordinary day. This massive dome features a multistory walkway (with an elevator, e.g. for wheelchairs) around a big rock grown with a rich selection beautiful plants. If you spend a few days in Singapore, this is a must-see. Moreover, if it is very hot outside, this is a lovely place to cool off!"
,,It seemed to be in a real forest.,4.0,,As soon as I enter you can see a real waterfall that falls from the top of the tower in the middle. All around was full with tropical vegetation and the umidity was very high. I went straight to the top with the elevator and then walked down the tower. I could also walk on the suspended pathways around the tower; I took wonderful photos. Besides the plants inside the tower there's a collection of rocks such as stalagmites and stalactites.
,,Wow,5.0,,Excellent .... No words ... A must visit Adjacent to gardens by the bay .. Both tickets r available from same counter .. Recommended
,,Not To Be Missed,5.0,,"What an amazing structure displaying plants and trees from the wetter parts of the world. This structure has no center support and the roof is support by large archers. In side also is around 5 storeys high cascading to the ground. You catch a lift to the top the wander the suspended walkways to the bottom, well worth a visit."
,,Ok... but somehow disapointing,2.0,,"Ok forest enviroment, created nicely to cater for the masstourism. however if have ever been near or in a real ""Cloud Forest"" rather disapointing. its really ceratde for ""big crowds"""
,,Impressive.,5.0,,This was very impressive the lay out was excellent and the walk through it. Liked how they had constructed the waterfall and that you were under it. Certainly worth a visit.
,,Spiral down an ancient rainforest...,4.0,,"Cloud Forest was our third fave attraction after Flower Dome and Super Trees (esp the bridge walk and the free night show) of Gardens By The Bay. Lovely cool area to retreat from the noon day sun. You go up in a lift the walk down the bridge that spirals back down around the waterfall and plants. Very neat, nifty place!"

,,Futuristic awesomeness,5.0,,"Hada fantastic recreational stroll here! Im not a plant person, but the design and decoration here is just splendid. Highly recommended."
,,Great,4.0,,Great little attraction to visit while in Singapore. Beautiful gardens and like nothing Ive seen before. You can get a little wet if you get to close to the water features.

This climate controlled domed area allows you to explore a range of orchids, pitcher plants and ferns in a setting which is unique and completely captivating. Look out for the regular bursts of moisture and the great waterfall as you wander up, down and through the different levels. A great experience and so cleverly done.

,,Walking in the clouds!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"Situated in gardens by the bay, this is the largest man made cloud forest in the world. It showcases thousands of species of plants found in cloud forest regions.The beautiful waterfall and exotic species of plants makes it an experience worth remembering. You will actually feel as if you are in a forest and are walking i the midst of clouds.The cave crystal structures and the short 20 min movie on global warming is very informative. There is an earth data centre as well with some interesting facts about earth."
,,...I love it...great for plant buffs...,4.0,,....the collection of plants and flowers are just magnificent...lots of photo opportunities...make allowances for the non English speaking crowd.....allow lots of time to slowly enjoy the flowers...

,,Wonderful,5.0,,Too satisfying and never regretted that i visited the cloud forest. KInd of jungle trekking in the middle of city
,,Singapore is full of surprises,4.0,,It's amazing to be here and every bit of it will wow you! what a place. Remember to take your camera as you will be tempted to take many pictures
,,Superbly designed!,5.0,,This is a real innovative way of educating and showing various plants in a cloud forest area. When you enter the place you are blown away by a huge man made waterfall coming down a 'mountain'. As you make your way through and around it you can see many amazing plants and also get educated. You get to view this from various places the walkabouts are designed that way. At the end there is a superb and eye opening video on what climate change is going to do to the world from now till 2100. It's not visually presented like a normal video too. This place is best experienced than described in detail. It can get a bit chilly in there at times so be prepared. Excellent place!!!
,,Must Visit,5.0,,Great place to visit in the evening. It is a you could spend hours in and the cloud walk is a mess do
,,Really enjoyed visiting the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Take some time to wander through, there is a different view around every turn. Lovely and very clever garden."
,,Take a good camera,4.0,,"My 18yr old granddaughter chose this place to visit as we had only 5 days to fit in all site seeing. She being a student at WAPA and keen to take photos enjoyed this wonderful, colourful, floral art place.The centre housing 5 floors has a waterfall from top to bottom and covered in plants of all gender. Maybe it wouldn't interest younger children seeking excitement although the flytrap plants display has been cleverly put together in parts of LEGGO. A shuttle bus return up to the indoor garden is a must on a sticky/rainy day and only $2 but if you want to look around the outside garden areas you should take the walk."
,,An extraordinary experince in the rain forest - MUST GO,5.0,,"Breath taking. Remind me scenes in the movies Jurassic Park and Avatar. Simply magical, the walk, the waterfall. It's A W E S O M E N E S S !"
,,Forest Dome that is WOW,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is the second glass dome that forms part of Garden by the Bay exhibit. To go there you take the smrt to Bay Front station.

,,Look carefully for the colugo,5.0,,"If you are lucky, you may see a unique mammal somewhat inaccurately called a ""flying lemur""-- a colugo, or large glider mammal of strange beauty. They are grey like the trees, but common in the forest. The cloud forest paths are under renovation and it...More"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Great use of the space with clever walkways and interesting information on the flora and fauna. Also a good place to cool off from the heat and humidity!
,,Amazing experience - the kids will love it!,4.0,,As the Second part of the Paid tour this Dome is more exciting - The waterfall that crashes down from a height creates the humidity for this venture and the temperature is controlled so that plants can grow and maintain themselves. There were no insects...More
,,Garden by the Bay - I say definitely go and explore!,5.0,,"Spent the entire day wondering through these amazing gardens and the cloud forest.

,,Great evelated walkways,5.0,,A cloud forest inside a massive greenhouse! This is an amazing place and you will love the cool air that transports you to the top of a high mountain from the heat and humidity of Singapore.

,,Great place for romantic walk...,5.0,,"The mist in the air, cool breeze, waterfall and sound of whizzing breeze... One has to pinch oneself to realize that one is not lost in the forest but very much in Singapore... Interesting skywalk and forest like feeling in an urban clime leaves one thoroughly satisfied.... literally a walk in the clouds!!!!"
,,"Love this place, great get away from the Singapore heat",5.0,,"Be amazed! The flowers, greeneries and the waterfall! Love them all. Tips: bring a jacket! You will feel freezing there. Bring a pram for your toddler, so everyone can enjoy the scenery and the coolness there comfortablely"

,,Great idea....,4.0,,....to reconstruct a cloud forest as it is likely most people have not had an opportunity to visit one. Well thought out with some thought provoking comments.
,,Go on a cloud walk,5.0,,"This display is very well designed, with lots of plants and flowers. There's a huge waterfall which greets you as you enter. The journey through the Cloud Forest is very interesting with different things to see as you move through."
,,Wonderful place to visit,5.0,,Wonderful place you should visit and enjoy staying there for at least two hours. A lot of attractive plants and a waterfall looks real.
,,Disappointed,4.0,,Closed for whatever reason. So dis pointing travelled from Australia. We took a little bus around park for $8 which was better than walking.
,,very educational and eco-aware,5.0,,"One of the best places to visit in SGP. My son (7) and I spent couple of hours here and were amazed by the games with touch-screens at the exit and especialy with the short movie what would happen if temperature on earth would rise for 5 C. It really gave us lots to think about and passed us a very strong ecological message.
I really liked how that whole park is provided with natural energy through rain, sun and wind. It's all showed and explained in an interesting exhibition at the exit of the dome.
This place really give you a lot for the entrance ticked you pay, it's not just the fresh feeling of rainforest, but also a strong message what we should all think about for the future of our planet and our children.
Loved it!"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Unexpected - environmentally friendly, educative as well as beautiful. Cool on a hot day. Quirky. Lots of people but not overcrowded."
,,An excellent concept,5.0,,"Loved the concept, beautifully presented. Was told it is similar to the Eden Project which I haven't seen yet. I spent an hour but you could spend half a day there if you are a real botanist"
,,Better than Gardens,4.0,,"This has a waterfall and a walkway that's very high, so if your afraid of heights, probably not a good idea."
,,Cool!,5.0,,"Lovely walk in the mist, amazing architecture to create this wonderland. The walkway also has great views of the harbour beyond"
,,Wonderful place,4.0,,Wonderful place to visit and a must-see while in Marina Bay. As soon as you walk in you are welcomed with a stunning view of the waterfall and the flowers. A really great place to just relax a bit and let your brain cool down a bit.
,,CLOUD FOREST - VISIT FOR MAN MADE WATERFALL,5.0,,"Climate in Singapore is hot and humid but cloud forest will give you required soothing. Cloud forest has got man made waterfall and cloud walk, which make you literately feel that you are walking in clouds. A must do attraction."
,,Bring Your Camera!,5.0,,A must see for everyone! Inside there is a huge waterfall and walkways which is all just a lot of fun. Definitely need to take your camera with. It can get quite cold in there so bring a light jumper.
,,Remarkable Construction,5.0,,"The building of the Cloud Forest is a storey in itself.
Walking in and seeing the huge waterfall - wow.
The Cloud Forest is about 7 stories high and from the top you can experience the Cloud Walk seeing all these tropical plants clinging to the side of the artificial mountain. Simply stupendous."
,,Magnifient Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Away from the humidity and heat of the Singapore, you will appreciate the reasons why we ought to preserve rainforests to help keep the heat of the world down. At the doorway of the Cloud Forest, a cool cascading waterfall welcomes you. If you go at the right part of the day, you will even experience the spraying of mist in this dome that really make one feel like you are in the cool cool rainforest.
Take the lift and start wallking from the uppermost part - this is is most friendly way to appreciate the flora, fauna and scientific explanations behind the preservation of the forest, Global Warming and the use of recycled water in the Gardens by the Bay to generate electricity for the whole garden.
Right at the top of the Cloud Forest, see if you can spot the 2 maple trees that are exposed to 2 types of temperatures of the 4 seasons. They have 2 different looks. Along the way down the spiralling walkway, enjoy the different types of florar and fauna. See if you can spot the different kinds of anthuriums."
,,Cool indoor rain forest,5.0,,"The idea to make an indoor rain forest is brilliant. I like the green plants, the train miniature, the water sounds, but most of all, i like the cool temperature. And it is ecological ! The waterfall is beautiful. I think nothing about this place that i dislike."
,,Waterfall oasis,4.0,,A lovely escape from the heat in this air conditioned dome with cascading waterfall and plant life. Worth a visit but not a 'must see'.
,,Very nice place,4.0,,It is a very nice and relaxing place to visit. The bridges are not scary at all and allows wheelchair access. The view is very nice it is like a walk in the clouds.
,,Time travel,5.0,,It was raining very heavily on the day - which added to the atmosphere . We could see great swirls of waters cascading down the outside of the glass dome while inside it was a comfortable temperate lost in the mists of time. Wonderful attraction.
,,Gardens above the clouds overlooking the Bay,5.0,,It's an amazing atmosphere and waterfall is very refreshing. It's wheelchair friendly so all went well. The plants are out of this world. Took some amazing photographs which I'll treasure. Will be back for sure and take my friends there
,,waterfall in a greenhouse,5.0,,"Beautiful display of plants, trees and flowers. The waterfall is amazing. Well worth a visit (also a nice air conditioned reprieve from the heat)"
,,Excellent Developed Forest,4.0,,Its amazing man made build rain forest. Excellent cloud forest as they have nice cloud walk. Excellent views especially when the fogging is there. Nice maintained and its world class.
,,Stunning and impressive,5.0,,"The Cloud Garden is a truly impressive architectural and horticultural achievement...and a cool and refreshing respite from the Singapore heat and humidity.

The overall layout of the forest displays and the experience of walking high up on the suspended upper levels were interesting and kept the kids engaged (although the colour and nursery themes of the adjoining Flower Dome ultimately left a greater impression on my children)."
,,Must see,5.0,,"The must see for the SG gardens by the bay visitor, this magnificent ""hosted"" garden contains marvellous flowers from all over the world. Highly recommended"
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"Wonderful experience and quite awe inspiring. The water fall at the entrance, with its thundering sound, is a really beautiful."
,,Wait for the mist,5.0,,"This is a place where rainforest comes alive! I now realize that rainforest are actually has become endangered. Coming to the cloud forest let us understand more things about habitats and plants as well. The kids are enjoying the mist that are coming every 2 hours making the place looks like clouds.

The waterfall also beautiful and do use a light jacket that is waterproof. there are areas not suitable for those who are afraid of heights."
,,wow factor,5.0,,"This was the best of all the sites we visited. Any visitor to Singapore should make an effort to visit these gardens as it will blow you away; it's like being in the rain forest, only you are in the centre of the city."
,,Best part of my trip,5.0,,"Great overall experience, good respite from the heat, educational and fun. Might be a bit of a test for those with issues with heights (which I am one of!)"
,,Best experience in Singapore,5.0,,"Best experience in Singapore. A Must do! and you can spend anywhere from an hour to 5 hours there, up to you. Absolutely stunning."
,,Cloud Forest & Flower Domes,5.0,,A must see in Singapore. It will be interesting to see what the surrounding structures will look like in a few years. I wish I had more time to do the canopy walk. You may want to do the canopy walk during morning hours!
,,Purely amazing!,5.0,,"Just go in. You'll see why it's such a popular place. :) Nice and cool inside compared to the hot and humid outside weather. Go in, walk around and take as many selfies as you like."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Amazing, go and see this marvellousness gardens it is breathtaking and was extremely educational for our children. Worth every dollar spent."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Wow, it is fantastic. The plants are fabulous, so vibrant and pretty. The walkway is safe, very stable for older people or people who are a little bit scared of heights. There is plenty of room to move safely past people and plenty to see"
,,Impressive.,4.0,,"This is a wonderful engineering and biological feat - transferring a cool living mountain forest indoors, and providing a detailed explanation of the eco system as you meander around the attraction. Cooling streams and waterfall, wonderful plants and displays and I learned an awful lot about eco balance.

I would have given it 5 stars except that my visit was marred by the endless tour groups (it has to be said mainly Chinese) led by people with a flag rushing around the attraction in as little time as possible all shouting shoving and pushing to capture 'selfies' at each and every juncture.

I was going to visit the adjacent orchid dome but couldn't face more selfie crowds and gave away my ticket to another visitor. As a non resident you can't buy separate tickets which are available to residents only."
,,Great place to view forest plants in the middle of city,5.0,,"Great walkway, have a nice picture taking along the path. The waterfall is amazing and great to cool the hot weather outside of the dome. Must visit"
,,High level entertainment...,5.0,,"Cool off in the clouds surrounded by succulent planting! Be aware that the walkway experience may not be as enjoyable for those with vertigo tendencies, but it's well worthwhile for everyone else."
,,lovely,5.0,,as soon as you walk in you escape the heat and are instantly cooled down by the 6 story waterfall surrounded by beautiful leaves and flowers and air-conditioning. stunning flowers and great opportunities for photography enthusiasts. well labelled and set out. i really enjoyed the floral lego exhibit which was really different and awesome (the kids would love it). awesome Crystal gallery as well located on one of the upper floors. walk around the pathways up the top and you will get some great views of the city and the marina bay sands hotel. would definitely recommended when in Singapore!
,,"Excellent ,do not miss it.",5.0,,"plan a full day for visiting cloud forest and flower dome along with gardens by the bay. visit during day time ,wait until misting time to enjoy it in full.If you are interested in fauna you may need more than 2 hours for visit."
,,Really lovely!,5.0,,"A very informative and lovely attraction in the Gardens by the Bay. Honestly, I liked this more than the Flower Dome. Gets cold in there so make sure to carry a sweater."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,A tropical experience to cherish. The effort put into creating this place is beyond my expectations having grown up in tropical country. Countless flora and fauna were grown intricately in a dome. Vivid wonderful images from this visit.
,,Beautiful & Informative,5.0,,"Loved the cloud forest - not only is it full of beautiful plants with a viewing walkway wrapped around the 7 story man-made misty 'mountain' but its a neat way to preserve a unique and rapidly declining ecosystem. Another bonus is that the whole dome is climate controlled (about 20 degrees C) - a nice escape from the heat of Singapore!

Check out the info display on the basement level on your way out which explains how Gardens by the Bay has been built to be as sustainable and self-sufficient as possible - harvesting rainwater, generating power etc."
,,Up in the cooling clouds.,5.0,,We thought this was going to be really hot and stuffy but we weren't prepared to not go because of the heat. We were delightfully surprised to walk into a cooling waterfall. The cloud forest was my favourite of the two gardens. It is beautifully done and if Singapore cant do gardens then I don't know who can. Well worth a visit.
,,Second visit just as good,4.0,,"This was my second visit to the Cloud Dome and I still found things to see that I'd missed before. I would definitely visit next time as well.

We were lucky enough to co-inside our visit with the misting at 12 p.m. and it was eerie and magical. I believe there are a few mistings a day, so perhaps check out the times. Maybe they are on the website?"
,,Go if you're not scared of heights,5.0,,how can you describe this incredible experience but to say go if you're not scared of heights and be truly amazed and what they have achieved here.
,,Surreal,4.0,,"Get lost here, the feel on your skin is exhilarating. Don't know your plants, it doesn't matter just go for the transportation to a forest. You'll can see plants from countries you may never get to visit."
,,Nice,4.0,,"If you have to make a choice between the 2 domes, this is the one to choose. Much more dramatic and interesting. The flower dome is pretty and colourful but a tad kitsch."
,,Little bit of paradise,4.0,,"This is worth every penny, fabulous plants and quite magical great for those who have a good imagination and like a little fantasy . Children will be thrilled and adults enthralled. Go and enjoy."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Just do it. Even if plants don't do it for you, the layout and engineering is amazing. Truly a 3D botanical exhibition."
,,Don't miss this if you visit Marina Bay,5.0,,It's a big doom as you imagine but it provides interesting experience more than you might imagine. Go to cloud of forest and botanical garden if you visit Marina Bay
,,"Looks impressive, but could be improved",4.0,,"I'd give this a 3 and a half rating if I could as it was good, but not as good as the flower dome.
The structure itself is very impressive, but once you get to the top, you have to follow quite a narrow walkway down. People stop and take photos along the way blocking people behind them, so you can't really go at your own pace.
The plants are definitely beautiful, but there's not a huge variety in the different levels. The crystal mountain section is quite tacky, but I thought the secret garden was lovely with lots of cute sculptures.
I'd still recommend visiting, but if you have to choose between this and the flower dome I'd choose the flower dome."
,,Is like to be in other world ...,5.0,,"Fantastic experience going up and up an finally find the treasure !!
If you are in the garden go for this attraction is one of tjhe most beautiful ones in Singapore . Bring a camera , water , extra battery for the camera , where very comfortable clothes and don't forget a hat !!! Enjoy ..."
,,A walk through the mist,5.0,,A unique experience in visiting botanical gardens. Healthy plants. Very well designed. Educational too.
,,It's decent and unique,4.0,,It's a decent attraction. It's not something I go crazy over but it's a massive structure with some cool plants in it. I also went in the dome with all the flowers and spent a lot more time in there. The cloud forest is a good visit but just doesn't have the wow factor that the flower dome has for me. We were in there for probably 20-30 minutes walking from the top to the bottom. It's certainly unique so it might just be worth it to see.
,,"Make made mist,quite a brilliant idea",3.0,,The artificial man made mist (using minute microscopic spray nozzle)cloud appears to mimic a cloud forest from a high level
,,Magnificent Garden,5.0,,"In side Gardens by the Bay, this man mad exhibition is a great example of a tropical garden, that is ever changing."
,,Great experience,4.0,,Although expensive the Cloud Forest is worth seeing. There is a walkway seven storeys high which looks down on the waterfall and all of the rainforest plants. Very well done
,,Feels like you are stepping into another world,5.0,,We loved the cloud forest and we felt like we were transported to another world as soon as we entered. We didn't have a lot of time to spend here but we loved every second of our visit and highly recommend it
,,Amazing,5.0,,Cloud forest was amazing. We wondered around here for at least an hour. I love the walk ways and the waterfall.
,,"Wonderful, educational place",5.0,,I've been here for the second time and I was happily surprised that I enjoyed Cloud Forest better this time. More plants were flowering this time and since we were able to catch the 'misting' schedule at 10am it really seemed that we were up on a mountain with clouds making the place foggy;) Visiting Cloud Forest really is an educational experience and gives us an opportunity to see the flora on a high altitude without actually having to climb a mountain.
,,Fantastic !,5.0,,"Such a bonus to see this amazing place on our travels. The scale of the building enclosed in glass with the water fall, the lush plants and easy movement between the levels makes for a great time. Photographers delight ! If you vaguely like plants, flowers or nature in genreal then this is for you. Sited close to the city, taxis are plentiful ( and reasonably priced ) , we then walked from here to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, about 10 min away."
,,This is a must see,5.0,,I was there last year and it was magnificent and this year they surpassed that with the Nursery Rhyme exhibition.
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,"Amazing place to visit and tour; recommend you come here during the afternoon to escape outdoor heat. Amazing waterfalls, flowers, and educational exhibits."
,,Terrifying and deeply moving at the same time- will take your breath away!,5.0,,"These gardens took our breaths away. We have seen gardens in domes and pyramids before in Omaha. Nebraska and Galveston, Texas but the elevator up and mildly terrifying walk down in SIngapore's Cloud Forest in the Gardens by the Bay is unique and amazing.

I would have loved to see some animals interacting with the plants (fish or birds or butterflies) but the variety of the orchids and carnivorous plants beat any other garden we've been to."
,,"Nice, spectacular.",5.0,,Part of gardens by the bay - a must see. The very tall waterfall is amazing and all the plants are well looked after.
,,Stunning,5.0,,A mountain eco-system in miniature. Very impressive design and construction and a wonderfully cool place to spend an hour or two.
,,Amazing,5.0,,If you visit only one attraction in Singapore make it this one. Absolutely amazing for young and old. Informative and entertaining. A lovely afternoon out for all the family.
,,nice flower during xmas,4.0,,i been here with friend... and i can see all the winter flower that we can see only on winter... all looks nice and good.. and we have fun take pic a lot..nearby got stall selling food...
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A part of Gardens by the Bay, its well worth looking at and paying of a ticket, its amazing to walk around, and good for getting out of the humidly"
,,Go just do it!,4.0,,I have always been afraid of heights but i was determined to climb the highest peak in Cloud Forest. Walking on the bridge and looking down made me feel dizzy. It was fun doing it with my family. We had fun laughing althroughout. The man made waterfalls seems so real. But the best part of the Cloud Forest is the short film about environmental awareness. It made me realized that each one of us has a vital role to make planet earth live longer!
,,Lose yourself in this man-made forest.,4.0,,"This is one of the few paid for parts of the Gardens by the Bay attraction but well worth the fee. If I only had the time to visit a single greenhouse I'd definitely visit the Cloud Forest. There's plenty of colourful flowers to see and when you first enter a huge thunderous waterfall. Perfect for cooling down after the Singapore heat.

Start at the top and make your way down the man-made mountain taking in the sights and colours of the flowers. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Imagine the swirling clouds,5.0,,With the devastation of tropical rain forests around the world any thing that can be done to preserve this ecological niche and show an awareness to every one of what is going missing is terrific. A cool and moist conservatory this is a fantastic place to visit and enjoy the natural splendour's and sculptures portrayed. A multi pass gets you into all attractions. A must do and see.
,,An absolute must to see.,5.0,,"Beautiful, amazing, wondrous green experienced. After a humid walk from Marina Bay Hotel, entering the forest was such a visual experience, cool with water falls lightly spraying you, pleasantly surprised."
,,A nice break from city swelter,4.0,,"This is now a must see for visitors and residents alike. Very easy to get too and part of the now famous Gardens by the Bay development that has been open now for a couple of years.
The Cloud Forest is especially interesting because the climate controlled environment allows you to observe several different plant habitats in microcosm as you work your way up the building. It is also a huge relief to enter the building for some respite from the very high humidity and heat outside.
I love to take friends when they visit. My 90 year old dad loves it because he can get access to virtually every part by lift and ramp thus saving his tired old legs. Wheelchair access is also easy and, for a small deposit, you can secure a wheelchair for an elderly relative or friend near the main entrance.
Staff at the gardens are well-trained and helpful. You'll also come across numerous other visitors from around the world who are only to happy to help you grab a memorable picture on your camera or phone."
,,Visit during Daylight Hours.,4.0,,Amazing indoor gardens with a waterfall and elevated walkway best viewed in daylight. (We went in the evening so was not so easy to view)
,,The Forest,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing how they have put this together,don't hesitate to visit this place is is totally worth it, you buy one ticket that gets you into the three attractions."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Go early, 10.30 am is early in Singapore, amazing sculptures and plants, indoors so is quite a good escape from the heat, quite a variety of different plants from around the world, takes a couple of hours, make sure to see the waterfall park next door, beautiful orchids and rain forest plants"
,,Amazing Place to visit!,5.0,,Loved this place -- a great place to visit especially with kids. The indoor waterfall is wonderful and the coolness of the interiors a good respite from the sometimes humid weather. Not to be missed!
,,An enjoyable morning outing,5.0,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay two years ago, but did not go to the Cloud Forest, as there were long waiting lines at the ticket counter. This time we took a taxi from our hotel to arrive early, there were no lines at the ticket counter and we enjoyed our visit immensely, not only because the temperature was cooler than outside. Access and walking around the dome was easy. The Cloud Forest was spectacular, with so many beautiful plants on display. We took the lift up and walked down, avoiding the metal grid floors (like many others). We stayed for a light lunch and a coffee at the restaurant near the souvenir shop before taking a taxi back to our hotel – a very enjoyable morning.
Be sure to arrive early and check that schools are not on holiday, as it can get very crowded at times."
,,Amazing..,4.0,,"It was something that I was not sure of, but so glad I went. As you enter through the doors you be surprised by the amazing waterfall and plants. The place is enormous and I thought it would be hot and humid inside but its not suprisingly cool. If you have time it is well worth it. It is also very accessible by MRT as well."
,,amazing man made structure of flora and fauna,4.0,,Splendid SG attraction wherein you can observe how the SG government reaaly cares for mother earth. It showcase the importance of cloud forest to mankind.
,,Misty rainforest with a waterfall!,5.0,,"Brilliant! I never expected to find a waterfall 6 floors high in the middle of Singapore.
If you can schedule the time of your visit, make sure you are here on the hour as that's when they release the mist from special pipes. There is also a lot of high bridges from the top floor slowly circling the dome and coming down letting you explore all the species of plants and discover some nature."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"This is a wonderfull experience, but make sure you are not afraid of heights as you will be running very quickly through ther or rooted to the spot. The views are magnificant"
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,Spend a day or at least half a day at this fantastic place. Plants and trees from all over the world. Easy for all.
,,Exhilarating and fascinating,5.0,,"A great attraction and possibly the best one at Gardens by the Bay. The waterfall was indeed breathtaking. The canopy walk above too was spectacular. I am generally afraid of heights but did not regret one bit taking the walk on the canopy. Just about every part inside the Gardens by the Bay is photogenic and Instagrammable. Anyone visiting here should make this stop a priority,"
,,The best one thing to do out of the whole garden thingy,5.0,,"My wife and I did the outdoor gardens, the restaurant at the top, the cloud forest and the other dome thingy. We'd recommend skipping all of it EXCEPT the cloud forest. That was really cool. Neat to ascend through the different plant life levels and the cool mist refreshing vs the hot humid outside of Singapore. Can also proceed at your own pace and double back too."
,,Wow.,5.0,,1 of the Domes at Gardens by the Bay and pretty incredible. More humid inside that the other one but cooler than outside. A fabulous exhibition with some highlights worth seeing.
,,Gorgeous Forest,5.0,,Amazing ! Love how its been design. Was there for Tulip Festival and took the opportunity to go around. Love it !
,,Decent,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is decent! The waterfall inside is quite spectacular to look at and view from down below and up above! It's a very educational place, learning quite a lot as you go around."
,,One of its Kind,5.0,,This is a world class super structure with a great flora and fauna. This place is a must visit if you are travelling to Singapore.
,,"go into the dome, pay the money, its good",5.0,,"definetly well worth going here , you pay a fee to get inside , very good designed and laid out, lots different plants clinning to the rock surface. nice peacfull, great waterfall."
,,DYN-O-MITE,5.0,,If there is only one thing you do in Singapore this had got to be it. Take the time to explore all the nooks and crannies of the structure. I enjoyed the balcony near the top of the waterfall you see when you first enter.
,,nothing special,3.0,,"it was nice and all, but only worth it if you have nothing else to do. my own opinion. nice waterfall inside, and a few cool plants. nothing special."
,,Bring a jacket,5.0,,Great place to escape the heat - only need about 20 minutes in hear - so make sure you explore the other areas of the garden!
,,Cool down in hot Singapore,5.0,,"Another amazing piece of modern Singapore architecture, who else would but a high altitude rain forest in the middle of downtown. The waterfall and plants are incredible worth the entry fee"
,,Lost world,4.0,,This is the second conservatory at Gardens by the bay. Could be a bit difficult for people with disabilities- although there is a lift to take people up. Most of this area is a winding walkway. Scenery a bit like Jurassic park
,,Majestic & Magical,5.0,,"Visitors are ""greeted"" by a waterfall- like a giant water misting fan.
Wander through a beautiful forest to reach the elevators to get to the top. If you're not acrophobic, walk the Cloud Walk & Treetop Walk and enjoy the view.

Appreciate the 5ºC temperature difference afterwards before checking out the Secret Garden."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,A must do. So you pay extra but what you get for your$ is just amazing. 100k plants on 6 different levels. Catch the lift up and wander around. We arrived at misting time which was a relief from the humidity outside. Great photos through the glass of the skyscrapers of Singapore
,,Beautiful,5.0,,My daughter and I visited the cloud forest and loved it! In a nut shell a very large dome (like something out of the movie Elysium) houses about 6 stories of the most amazing gardens which includes a large waterfall.. There is a suspended walking bridge which winds its way through the dome giving you a fabulous view of the gardens and out across part of Singapore. It gets chilly inside although not enough for us to bother with a jacket.. A great escape from the city and the heat..
,,Chilling one,5.0,,"Good one to see for first time..Plan to be there during mist hours. Whole cloud forest gives you a glimpse of wonders of the whole gobe..like, crystal muntains etc..Worth of the money..But subsequent visits may bore you ;)"
,,A forest in the middle of the City,5.0,,The sheer size of the dome is staggering and one would wonder how much energy it consumes as the whole area is A/Cd only to realize that they are employing cutting edge technology which is both energy efficient and sustainable. Best to visit while the sun is still up as it is a bit dark inside during the night.
,,welll excellent,5.0,,well its fabulous i havent visited this place yet but guys srsly this is a fabuulous place to visit beautiful brezze fresh atmosphere a nce thriiling weather guys m sure this is a trmendous forest u all willl have a superb .. wowwwwwwww what a greener y beautifull y decorated constructed with fab tecnology fully green everywhere and and specially in evening when u watch ts like amazing ligtinnings everywhere wowo guys i really really suggest all my viewers to plz go singapore and visit this beauty of cloud forest hatsss off to the makers of this beautiful and amazing forest
,,One of The Best Things to Do In Singapore,5.0,,"This is a great few hours for the WHOLE family, definitely one of the best things to do along with the gardens at night in Singapore.

Suggest you go around 2 or 3 in afternoon, then wander over to the shopping centre adjacent to marina bay sands and have dinner, prior to watching the gardens at night spectacular - lying on you back."
,,Very unique experience,5.0,,"Begin on the ground and stroll your way all the way up into the clouds, albeit indoors. Lush tropical plants/flowers/trees, falling water and comfortable climate-controlled strolls."
,,another dimension,4.0,,beautiful place with feeling like you are in the mist of clouds. sometimes there are promotion for tickets so do check out website like.groupon or other tour agents.
,,i was on a cloud,5.0,,"as soon as one enters the conservatory, it tends to give out that feeling of being someplace else, this towering man made waterfall takes you away to dreamland, africa whatever we can imagine, it has a lift which takes to the topmost level and there are path which winds down from there, all the while feeling like the clouds are just around.
beautifully concepted."
,,great experience.,5.0,,Great visit especially for families. Going in the evening I think may be a good choice. This is what we did and were able to watch the light show as well.
,,Must visit,5.0,,The cloud forest is amazing and is a must for any Singapore visit and is a welcome break from the outside heat
,,Great experience,5.0,,Loved it!!! Loved to hear about how their environmental plans. Loved the atmosphere. Some seats to relax in there would be great. Loved it!!! Will return one day.
,,What a wonderful oasis in Singapore ',5.0,,"Had a wonderful morning at the cloud forest. On a hot, humid day, it was such a relief to be in this cool dome with such splendid plant life around us. Well worth a visit, the shuttle service is great too on a hot day at $S2 per person."
,,Vision And Comfort,4.0,,"Excellent family venue complete with waterfall, skywalk, and disability friendly. Different flora at different levels, with different Orchids and other flowering plants makes this a great place to escape the heat and enjoy a kaleidoscope of colours!"
,,"Pretty, but artificial",4.0,,"This is a cool place to go to see all kinds of rainforest plants. It looks amazing inside, although it is quite artificial"
,,Beautiful Architecture,4.0,,"Just located right beside Gardens by the bay, the cloud forest offers tourists a chance to climb at a high elevation to see a bird eye view to the whole garden and waterfall."
,,Dont miss the part where they explain the environmental concept!!,5.0,,Its interesting to know why the place is designed for a good purpose and still made so seamlessly simple.
,,Worth a visit....,4.0,,What a lovely way to spend an hour - the foliage/plants/flowers were stunning and really gave you a feel for this areas natural beauty. Easy to get round with spectacular views over the bay at Singapore. A place not to be missed
,,Quite an experience,5.0,,A cool and very interesting place in the heart of the city. Worthwhile to go there if you have a day available and want to get out of the heat.
,,Like an indoor jungle,4.0,,You have to pay to go in here but I'd say it was worth the money and it's very well air conditioned which was extremely welcomed after walking around the gardens
,,Horticultural magnificence!,5.0,,"Who builds a mountain inside a glass house, equips it with a waterfall and artificial high altitude climate, plants it with a staggering array of beautiful mountain plants and then blends a walkway for huge numbers of tourist to wander through in amazement AND have the whole thing work perfectly.
The Singaporeans of course. This award winning tourist site is worth every cent of the entrance fee and can be accessed just a short walk from the Marina Sands SkyPark Towers."
,,Lost in the Mist,5.0,,"This was such a sensual experience as well as being very informative. I loved the displays where plants clung to mossy banks, It reminded me of my childhood home, of NZ"
,,Beautiful and a great learning experience,5.0,,"Finding the enterence can be a bit confusing as it is usually crowded with people but once inside the natural beauty at the huge amount of species of flora all in a very natural yet creative way is astounding. It is a must see when visiting Singapore. The waterfall is very striking but teamed with the humidity can make the bridge walk a little slippy so watch out. There is an audio commentary option available which we took, it is easy to use and the price is not too expensive, it was a must for those who want more information about the flora around the forest.
There is some indoor parts which show stalagmites and stalactites and also showing the effects on global warming and how it will effect us in the future as the world continues to heat up. Very educational and fun day out for adults and children."
,,Colourful flowers which shines at the night skies,5.0,,"Nothing shines much brighter than the cloud forest situated near the gardens by the bay.It has the best colours especially at night when the structure emit the purple light.

Besides the colour characteristics that the structure has, it has a unique angle for photographers to take of the Singapore metropolitan city. This gives a better opportunity for people to explore the skyline of Singapore."
,,Amazing idea,4.0,,"It was just like walking among the clouds when walking down the hanging path circling the ""mountain"" and the waterfall. For those who were afraid of heights, better chose to use the lift to go up and down after experiencing the inside of the ""mountain""."
,,Fascinating place!,5.0,,"You pay a fee to visit the Cloud Forest but as with most paying attractions in Singapore (we found the majority to be free actually), it's reasonable compared to similar attractions in Britain.

You take a lift to the top of a ""mountain"" wreathed in mist and covered with lush vegetation growing vertically on its slopes then you descend walkways spiralling down it to get an aerial view of the canopy and mountainside. There is a spectacular waterfall ( the largest indoor one in the world) taking centre stage, which will feature in many of your photos as you make your way down, I'm sure! It's also nice and cooling on a hot day!

There is a lot of interesting information about the biodiversity of cloud forests and how they are being threatened. In the theatre, we watched one of the most powerful programmes we have ever seen about global warming and its potential effects on our planet from now till 2100. It presented a truly terrifying picture.

I preferred the Cloud Forest to the Flower Dome as it felt much more natural and less stage-managed but I appreciate that the Flower Dome is trying to cater more for children, with its nursery rhyme themed gardens and it can be no bad thing to encourage their interest in plants. If I had to choose though, it's the Cloud Forest every time!"
,,Incredible! Beautiful! A must see!,5.0,,This is a MUST see! Breathtakingly beautiful. Great for families. We intended on a 'quick' visit so we could see other things but spent several hours there! Take a camera and a large memory card!
,,Best after dark,5.0,,"Cool down and experience the different zones or floors as you walk downwards from the top of the beautiful Cloud Forest. The walkways are at high altitudes, adding excitement to the tranquil mountain. At the bottom there is an educational section as well. The forest...More"
,,Chill n Thrill,5.0,,"Exhilarating Experience!! The Dome Entrance leads to a Spray of Gigantic Waterfall and A short Journey of Chill & Thrill unfolds hereon. Elevator zooms you up on the 7th storey and as you Stroll past the Tropical Rainforest Growth , you cannot miss inhaling the...More"
,,KIds Loved this attraction,5.0,,"like a kind of botany jurassik park, and what a view from the treetop café , amazing for the family , and can spend a few hours then go to Marina Bay"
,,Worth a Visit!,5.0,,I feel like there unfortunately isn't much to do in Singapore. This place however was definitely worth a visit and very beautiful. It's also really air conditioned and feels great after being in the suffocating humidity (I'm from a dry area so I can't handle...More
,,Gorgeous Manmade Forest!,4.0,,"I was here few hours ago with my brother. We only managed to visit cloud forest, and missed the other one, Flower Dome. The weather was super hot out there! But no worry, over here, Cloud Forest, it's an indoor tourist spot, moreover it's fully...More"
,,Fall,4.0,,"Huge artificial waterfall where even hot and humid outside, it eas a perfect temperature inside. Very well organized and you can start and restart from the beginning as you wish and like. Really nice flowers and a lot of green."
,,Very good,4.0,,"Very good experience, at first i thought it was not nice becuase of the artificial feel, but the place grew on me, the lost world part of the place is pretty good."
,,Nice,3.0,,Novel idea and well executed. It's worth a visit and certainly the waterfall and misty sprays are novel.The gift shop I think is overpriced and not very novel.
,,Too Expensive.,2.0,,"It was way to pricy for what is was. We walked around, but could not figure out the point of ht place was. Lots of people inside, and not a lot of information. Will not pay for go in again."
,,Great way to enjoy a garden,4.0,,"Tropical weather is usually hot or wet or both. Visiting the Cloud Forest - there is no need to worry about getting sweaty and sticky or if you need your rain-protection gear. Just step inside and you are in an indoor forest, safe from the whims of the weather.
The tower is a sight to behold, as is the waterfall that greets you as you enter. Take your time to explore the place - stop to read the info cards so that the experience becomes educational as well.
I would say the entrance fee is not too expensive, you can see that it is well-maintained and the money has to come from somewhere. I went there with my boyfriend and we easily spent about two hours in there, taking our time to enjoy each mini-attraction inside.
I really recommend visiting this place."
,,Great way to spend an afternoon in a cool environment.,5.0,,"Even though it was extremely hot and humid outside, it was a perfect temperature inside, huge waterfall which the kids loved. I loved the vast array of orchids."
,,Waterfall is beautiful!,4.0,,"As you walk in, your breath is taken away with the beautiful waterfall! The flowers were gorgeous - the best I've seen. Couldn't stop taking pictures!"
,,It's a must,5.0,,"This is a must if you do Gardens by the bay as the views set another angle our day got even better, a lift will get you to the top although the stairs are worth a go if you still got the energy"
,,Best indoor forest,5.0,,"I love this place so much! I have been back for the 4th time and will be back for more. It's an oasis in Singapore. The creator of this magnificent dome is a genius! Do prepare a cardigan or shawl when going in, the temperature is much colder than the sweltering heat outside"
,,The best conservatory!,5.0,,"I enjoyed the Cloud Forest conservatory far more than the flower dome at Gardens by the Bay. The beautiful tower in the middle covered with layers upon layers of greenery was just breathtaking, and the walks around the tower allowed for some great views."
,,Beautiful chilling palce,4.0,,"Couldbt imagine if man made things can be so beautiful . Freexing place but you very bautiful . You can go upto third floor and feel the chill . experience the different f,lora and how they are managed."
,,Very interesting garden,4.0,,"So interesting place to visit in a very developed city as Singapore, all the area (Gardens by the Bay), in fact is a ""must do"""
,,Amazing place. Very unique and unexpected,5.0,,"It's part of ""Gardens by the bay"". Not sure why is it to be reviewed seperately. However, I am doing it because I loved this experience. If you need more information about the place, please see the other review I just left."
,,One of its kind! A Must Visit!,5.0,,"We were blown away by not only the amazing structure built (Must be an Enginnering chanllenge in itself) but also the environment and the extent that the Govt had put into this.

It is definately a must visit in Singapore ! This attraction is also suitable for family and kids!

(Pro tip: Make sure you align your visit during the mist time!)"
,,"Nice photo opps, but not much else.",3.0,,"We spent an afternoon at Gardens by the Bay, and collectively, this area is fantastic and unique and enjoyable, however, the Cloud Forest on its own is a bit of a let down. The waterfalls when you first enter are cool and make for a good photo opp, but other than that, it isn't very exciting. You walk up to the top and then walk down through the ""cloud canopy"" but it all looks the same. We felt this was too expensive for the actual experience, and we wouldn't do it again."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"Well worth the short trip to be awed by the range, colour & variety of flowers, plants & trees. The audio/visual display on their eco friendly operations is outstanding."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,This would be the biggest vertical garden in the world. The plants here come from moist tropical and sub-tropical climates. The range and colours are amazing. The building it's self is a fantastic example of modern architecture and engineering.
,,Visit Cloud Forest in Singapore,5.0,,People need to visit to see the world of nature in One Place... It is a perfect place to feel the nature learn about plants and see exotic Trees and Flowers
,,Best thing in the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The best thing in the Gardens by the bay. Its amazing that such an impressive arrangement is only 3 years old. Lots of fantastic tropical flowers hanging from the walls
,,Unexpected delights,5.0,,"We enjoyed the Gardens by the Bay but the Cloud Forest was our favourite 'dome. We bought separate tickets on separate days but it didn't cost too much more to do it this way. Inside the entrance is a waterfall, and it was cool on a hot hot humid day. We ventured to the very top, where spectacular views await. The 'forest' is impressive, and the little hidden side alleys hold unexpected delights. Take your time and wander around, this is a lovely way to spend a morning or afternoon."
,,Gardens by the bay <3,5.0,,"Nice experience , it was a part of gardens by the way. i thought its gonna get boring for me who is just 18 but i think i enjoyed this place the most"
,,awesome,5.0,,"yanother part of the Gardens, you will feel like you are in a forest....nice spot for pictures, you can go behind the waterfall as well, I really like the arrangement of different species of plants and flowers, especially the orchids, lrecommended"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was by far the highlight of Gardens By the Bay (and a great place to cool down after taking in the rest of the Gardens). Amazing architecture and particularly liked the Lego plantlife!!
,,Must to visit,4.0,,"A very nice place in Singapore for nature lovers its a7 storey infrastructure full of flowers trees that are found in cold regions the waterfall is amazing...
You will start gaining attraction as soon as you enter here...
A cool place to visit in hot weather of Singapore"
,,Bizzare and mysterious,5.0,,A wonderful atmosphere greets you once you enter the Cloud Forest. You can feel slight water droplets landing on your face and giving a refreshing feel. The plants are all quite exotic and unique. My favorite plant is the pitcher plant!! I think it is just too cool. A must visit if you happen to come to Garden By the Bay.
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,"A marvel of engineering, bringing the best of nature to man. Gorgeous indoor waterfall.

The skybridge gets you up and personal on the waterfall and the hanging gardens. And all these in the comfort of an air conditioned environment.

Perfect for people with limited disability, because there's easy access through elevators."
,,Cool Outdoor Feel,4.0,,The cloud forest aims to make you think that you are trekking a mountain and it somehow succeeded. There are amazing plants around and the man made waterfall is great. The temperature is very nice and cooling. You'll trek through the whole conservatory in a breeze. Spend some time to watch the mini documentary at the end of your walk through. Good info.
,,Cloud Forest -- Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Cloud Forest is amazingly beautiful and unique with myriads variety of flora. The waterfall on entering immediately cools you off with very fine cool mists. This is a place to take refuge from the heat outside. Cold air abounds as you walk around admiring the exotic flowers and greens.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Loved the cloud forest and all around gardens by the bay. Try to get there before sunset to enjoy the beautiful light and later the beautiful light and the light show.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,The better of the two domes with so much to see and do. It is better each time I come back as the plants have grown more and more looking more beautiful each time
,,Waterfalls is in the house,5.0,,"It was like seeing the whole tropical forest into this big dome!
its so cold since they have to keep the temperature low in order the whole trees and flowers can grow.

I dont like the fact that almost all the trees and flowers are didnt comes from Singapore... ut still, I really appreciate the idea.

its very good place to educate the childrens."
,,Cooling spray on entry,5.0,,"As you enter there is a HUGE waterfall, which makes the entry in so refreshing and instantly cooling from the humid heat of Singapore.
This was not high on my list of things to do/visit but walked out loving the place, it was really well planned lay out so that you weren't walking back and forth.
It was great having the different levels to see the waterfall and just walking around to see the gorgeous plants.
The place was really calming and relaxing.
Cost was $28 which includes the Flower Dome for an adult"
,,misty mist...cloudy clouds,5.0,,love the temperatures ....relief from scorching Singapore heat. also the pitcher plants are so beautiful to watch. the bridge walk ...is thrilling for kids. the waterfall is soothing.....!! do visit
,,No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Cloud Forest.,5.0,,"I am always amazed by both the grandeur and tranquility of Cloud Forest. The waterfall that greets you as you enter is fabulous and sets the tone for an amazing visit. The architecture and engineering must have been a real challenge.
The variety of plants, both ornamental and flowering is stunning, especially the orchids.
Make sure you take a camera."
,,Beautiful indoor forest,4.0,,The Cloud Forest is one of two indoor conservatories at Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. This is my preferred of the two with a stunning 4-storey man made waterfall. You take an elevator up to the top and make your way down the path that on occasion makes you feel like you're in a Jurassic Park movie (when the good stuff is happening). It's also a nice little getaway from the heat and humidity that is Singapore.
,,lovely place to visit,4.0,,"feels like you are in another world! the waterfall, fog really changes the whole atmosphere. never get tired of visiting cloud forest:) visitors can also learn a thing or two with the exhibits there."

,,Love it,5.0,,"This was probably my favourite part in Garden's by the bay. It's cool, interesting prospective. Not a big fan of heights but still... something different"
,,Seeing is Believing!!!,5.0,,"In concurrence and continuation with the Gardens by the Bay for which my opinion was just shared , Every nature lover should visit this place. Ideally must visit about 30 minuted before sun set to enjoy the forest both by the day and night. What make it more magical is the transition effect into the night."
,,A must see for nature lovers,5.0,,"Very nice walk within an air conditioned ""nature reserve"". Must be visited while you're at the gardens by the bay"
,,Amazing feature of the Gardens in the Bay,5.0,,This attraction is a great educational facility for young and old. From the waterfall to the video presentations we were enthralled by the emotional story it told.
,,Experience Rain Forest in the city,5.0,,"Escape from humid weather outside and enter the cool rain forest weather inside Cloud Forest. You could easily spent hours walking through Cloud Forest and amazed by the variety of flora. At the end of Cloud Forest trip, make sure to stop and take your time to know how Gardens by the Bay was built and how much thoughts was put into it. A great trip for family, solo traveler, and couple."
,,Excellent,5.0,,The place it just amazing... It's gives a naturistic theme and the mini water is wonderful.... And the awareness given at the end of the tour is really good.... Amazing place and a must visit to all nature lovers and tourist to.. :)

,,A Magical Place to spend your day.,5.0,,"Fantastic, be mesmerised as you enter and stroll past the towering waterfall. Wend your way around the mist covered plants and venture into the forest. This is without doubt one of the most spectacular displays on earth. Highly recommended."
,,O My God- you just have to visit,5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the Bay and a must visit. You will find my detailed note on the review. Just have to do this if you are short on time.
,,A great way to keep cool and explore,4.0,,"We loved taking our 2yo son through the Cloud Forest, it was lovely and cool. Only complaint is that it isn't that pram friendly with limited lifts/space. However, the Flower Dome is much better for prams."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,Beautiful place nice AC . Great to show your kids. And adult it is breathtaking and you can spend over an hour there
,,Amazing place,5.0,,crystal mountain Falls Tree walk All were good Disliked nothing the price ticket could be economical. The souvenir could be cheaper.
,,Superb,5.0,,"A must on your 'Bucket List'. Set aside at least a couple of hours for this visit. The conservatory is air conditioned so is comfortable to move around, I highly recommend and will visit again if in Singapore."
,,Worthwhile to go if you are already at Garden by the bay.,4.0,,Worthwhile to go if you are already at Garden By the Bay. Visit the dome too. Everything in one day will be possible.

,,Peaceful & Cool,5.0,,"Yes, its man made and magnificent. Pay the money and enjoy the amazing walk around the gardens in the cool - a great way to spend an hour or so."
,,Well worth the time,5.0,,What a fabulous place! Take some time to enjoy a good look around in this climate controlled environment. Very cleverly set out and a pleasure to visit. A great respite from the heat also.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,This place is amazing and worth putting aside 1-2 hours for alone at least. From the waterfall upon arriving to the 15 min movie about nature you will not be disappointed. My only criticism would be that if you cannot travel in elevators due to claustrophobia then you cannot do the cloud walk which is unfortunate. You come down from the top via stairs but you cannot get up via stairs.
,,Breathtaking experience,4.0,,The entry itself is brilliant. The water hits your face as you pass by. The view is awesome from the th & 5th floor. Awesome if you have enough time to spend there.

,,Spectacular and Worth a Visit,5.0,,"For non-Singaporeans, the ticket price is expensive, but this is definitely worth a visit. The ticket includes a visit to the Flower Forest Dome as well, so plan to spend at least two hours for both domes."
,,very cold,3.0,,this is good place.personally i didnt like it much.too much to walk.i didnt feel it worth going.there is a lift also.
,,nothing great,3.0,,cloud forest is in the garden by the bay.too much to walk.i dont feel it worth going.such a not great place
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"It is amazing how much bio-diversity can be contained in one building. The entrance fee is one of the ""best bargains"" in Singapore. And the engineering system which makes it all possible is itself a wonder!!!!"
,,Just amazing!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a dome within the Gardens by the Bay. You have to pay to go in but it is well worth the cost. The dome has so many flowers and plants, waterfalls and high walkways which make you feel that you are in a rain forest. Wonderful!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,Great place to visit - especially if you encounter a spell of bad weather in Singapore. This is al under one roof. But don't forget a jumper - its is really cold inside.
,,Nice and cold,4.0,,"Plenty of flowers and plants. Best place to be on a hot sunny afternoon. this is also a good place for kids to explore and be with nature. However, avoid school holidays as this place could be packed with visitors."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,It was enchanting! I loved it! It was like being in a real forest. Going to the top was exciting and so interesting!
,,Cool and interesting exhibit adjacent to Flower Dome,5.0,,The Cloud Forest was even better than the Flower Dome. You encounter a 4 (?) storey-waterfall when you walk in. It can be a bit slippery but is fine if you are careful.

,,If you have a bucket list...then this must be on it!!!!,5.0,,An experience that will travel with you forever. Truly a wonder of the 21st century. To do this together with the flower dome and botanical gardens. Singapore has shown the world what is possible
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Was a cool place to go on a hot day (pun intended), and all the plants were very nice, we enjoyed it very much"
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"next to the Gardens, you can buy a combo ticket. Get off Bayside MRT and there is a shuttle which takes you to both attractions."
,,Cool~!,4.0,,"After a long hot walk in the gardens by the bay, it is indeed cooling and refreshing to step in cloud forest. The treetop walk is well designed and plants are well-maintained. The bird-eye view to the surrounding structures and plants are impressive. Good job in raising awareness of global warming. An attraction worth going!"
,,Growing Exhibit,4.0,,"""This is my ideal camping weather."" so said my 17 year old son. We enjoyed the stroll down the incline around and through the mountain as well as the views of the city from the many vantage points. This exhibit is going to change and get even better as the plants continue to grow...."
,,An excellent exibition of plants,5.0,,What a good way to see plants and trees form around the world. A relaxing walk through the cloud forest

,,good and must go one time,5.0,,"nothing too explain about the attraction but yes one thing i can say the view from the top floor of the Singapore was unique and soothing.
Very clean and tidy
if you are planning to go to this place then buy the passes from airport rather than counter at the cloud forest
it will save you some dollars !!!"
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,Absolutely amazing. A very pleasant hour or so as we got there as it opened. You take a lift to the top and slowly make your way down. Not to be missed especially if you have a green thumb.
,,Dont go when its raining outside,5.0,,"As mentioned, dont go when it's raining outside... the clouds in the forest disappear. Amazing place to roam around in.. and it's nice and chilly, so if you're susceptible to the cold, bring a jacket"
,,Cloud Forest,3.0,,"The walkway through the trees was very interesting, although the price was a bit high for what it was."
,,Cloud forest,5.0,,I have near experienced anything like this before - just amazing - there are no corners. Up it seems there is something to see around every corner
,,Overrated perhaps?,3.0,,"Firstly as a non Singaporean - you pay more to visit this attraction. We found our time might have been better spend elsewhere so while it was okay, we wouldn't go back and cannot provide a glowing recommendation."
,,Good Concept,4.0,,"This is an unique architectural concept. One may appreciate this place for its presentation skills & the way it is shown to the world. It is all man made, but it is still enjoyable, especially at sunset."
,,An ecological miracle. Beautiful views inside and onto the surroundigns.,5.0,,"A MUST when beeing in Singapore! Use the shutlle (2$) from MRT station, convenient and you get less tired than walking."
,,nice and special attraction,4.0,,"I spent about 2 hours here, in the golden hour, e.g. just when the sun disappears, which gave the opportunity to see the waterfall and the groves both in daylight and colorful electric light."
,,Great Place To Enjoy Nature,5.0,,"I brought my 2 kids 5yrs and 6yrs old to enjoy the indoor nature and the thrilling walk on the ""long bridge"". I have been to this place 2 times! Our family thoroughly enjoyed it! At the same time, you can visit the Flower Dome next to it."

,,worth a visit,5.0,,"I would recommend visiting to all ages. its a fun, educational and scenic look at the local fauna. Spent around 1-2 hours walking around the area. You also get a great view of the area while on the walk from the top."
,,A must see,5.0,,Truly amazing. Would the entrance fee. The skywalk and the waterfall are very impressive and any visitor to Singapore needs to include this.
,,Nothing beats the real thing,3.0,,"It was impressive, but man made. Nothing still beats the real thing. Locals could buy tickets for either of the conservatory, but tourists have to buy tickets for both."
,,"interesting architecturally, less in terms of plants for amateurs",4.0,,"I enjoy modern architecture and I like what Singapore is about. Not every project can systematically extraordinary. I try to focus of the strong elements; in this case, I like the shape of the dome and I enjoyed the visit, even if I know nothing about plants."
,,Amazing and cool,5.0,,"This is a great place to get away from the outdoor heat, cool and misty inside this huge glass dome, spiral walkway to top, amazing array of tropical plants."
,,cool down on a hot and humid day,4.0,,The architecture is amazing and the arrangement of the plants is just beautiful. Walk up to the top for a wonderful experiance and nice views on the bay. Take about two hours time to enjoy this place without a hurry. You will enjoy it!
,,Walk in the trees is an amazing feature.,4.0,,"You can watch the night show from the sky walk or from the ground. The sky walk itself doesn't take that long and you don't have to be fit, it's easy and very enjoyable,"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,A great opportunity to learn about plants and take in the awesome views. Don't forget your camera. I didn't waste time with the audio rental which costs $ and also not required unless you are a botanist. There was a good show about conservation of the planet +5% near the end. There are mist times which makes the experience different. Lots of photo opportunities and information for light reading along the way. A great place for a family visit for all age groups. Its not that cold so don't need a jacket. I went when it was raining and not too bad. These attractions are indoors so all weather permitting.
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,Quick simply breathtaking and a must-see. Make sure to stick around after 4-5pm and are located at the ground floor to catch the sun-rays from the water sprinklers mist.
,,Warm clothing required,3.0,,"Part of the Gardens By the Bay attraction, the Cloud Forest houses a man-made waterfall, displays of stalactites/stalagmites, infographics on the environment and a short film on the impact of global warming. Air Con is on full blast so make sure you have a jacket/cardigan/shawl. If you are on a short visit to Singapore, would not recommend this."
,,Second visit & still loved it,5.0,,"The Cloud Dome is one of my favourite places to visit in Singapore.
Even when it is busy it is still a peaceful place. It's also a great place to escape the weather - nice & cool when it is hot outside and dry (apart from the mist of course) when it is raining outside.
The waterfall is a great feature, especially being able to view behind it and with the viewing platforms on various levels. The plants & flowers are amazing,"
,,Get your cloth before visit,4.0,,"Cloud forest is inside Garden By The Bay, but it need extra charges. It's extremely cold, better bring your cloth before visit. You can try the Cloud Walk, it's very high! I am so afraid if it. But it's a very good experience."
,,Miniature rainforest,5.0,,"A gift for Nature lover. Contrary to the outside environment, it gives you the 'feel' of rainforest by the integration of architecture and vegetation in the structure."
,,Part of the Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"Fantastic place to see, you can spend hours here and still not see all the wonderful creations, not to be missed"
,,Expectations were higher than reality,3.0,,The main attraction is actually a cylindrical tower made of concrete and covered with vegetation on its surface. You walk around it at different floor levels and are experiencing flowers at different floor levels of a rain forest. Unfortunately not many flowers were actually blossoming when we were there.
,,Our singapore stop off,5.0,,"On the way to Australia, stopped off for a few days to have another look around Singapore, this city changes so much in just a few years. In the marina bay area there is a barnd new shopping mall and the cloud forest by the E tech trees. You must love heights for the catwalk bit"
,,Love it,5.0,,"The stairs and lifts take you up in the clouds or mist, it also has an amazing waterfall, take a jacket its cold inside. Sounds crazy as its so hot outside."
,,A rainforest in the city,5.0,,Just Beautiful. A respite from the heat. A huge waterfall and rainforest plants in a huge dome conservatory. I love that it was wheelchair friendly and everyone could enjoy the environment using the elevated walkways.
,,Speechless,5.0,,"Second time here ( brought friends) and still amazed. Right from the huge waterfall in the entry to the very top of the magnificent gardens. You stand there wondering how on earth they built these gardens and even more amazing how they keep it looking so beautiful. Its a place where you can just stroll through and relax, helps that its even a little chilly in there a great escape from Singapores heat."
,,Beautiful Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Beautiful, Cool and Green place. A great place to visit be it rain or shine.. just bring along a sweater, cardigan or windbreaker for the kids or elderly. It can be a bit chilly for them. Nevertheless, it's enjoyable for the whole family. Being in there makes u feel like you're in the clouds.. nice & cool."
,,Cloud Forest in Tropical Singapore,4.0,,"This was a trip with my nephew and friend. We went during the Garden Festival in last August.

We went to both of the domes but i like Cloud Forest the most. Greeted by the impressive waterfall and had a lot of photo sessions.

The place is just like a secret garden and we really spent about 3 hours just in the Cloud Forest.

Look at the crowd and you know why people want to go."
,,Don't rush the Cloud Gardens,4.0,,"A great attraction, unique to Singapore but give yourself plenty of time because it can get very crowded, especially towards dusk at the weekends as people visit for the sound-and-light show outside. And there is some climbing unless you prefer to queue for the lifts. Give yourself time to allow the knots of families to pass so you can spend a few quiet moments with the individual plants."
,,Real Forest Like Experience!,5.0,,"Best to visit in the evening. Although artificially controlled, it feels like you are in a real rain forest. Be prepared for a cooler temperatures as it is little cold inside. The flower garden is very beautiful as well."
,,I love this place!!,5.0,,"I decided to go there in the afternoon. After walk around the city in hot weather. I feel fresh and cheerful after come to this place. It's cold. I also like concept of this dome, got lots of new knowledge about plants"
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"Classic place, very beautifully done. Amazing creativity. Breathtaking. Feels like heaven when you are here. This is a must visit place."
,,Man made forest ... so refreshing !,4.0,,Amazing place ... Its completely refreshing to see so much greenery between the concrete jungle. its best done in the evening and don't miss the light show .
,,See: gardens you the bay.,5.0,,You have to see this to appreciate it. Outstanding and easy access. Elevators to the top and an easy walk down suitable for partially disabled.
,,Excellent built and maintained.,5.0,,"What an amazing concept and beautifully maintained. The +5 degrees should not be missed, how explicitly it explains the dangers of deforestation and global warming."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit even if you are not really a plant/flower person. The glass domes are amazing to see and the mixture of plants and trees from around the world are amazing.
,,Do it first in Gardens by the Bay visit,4.0,,"Awesome place worth visiting this has to be the closest we can get to nature, the place has artificial rainfall carry a umbrella as well a cheater if you feel cold usually."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The whole area is well worth the visit, however the cloud forest is quite spectacular and something I have not seen elsewhere. Fully air conditioned for comfort it is a great walk with interesting plants and great views."
,,Truly magical experience!,5.0,,There is a book called The Magic Faraway Tree by Enid Blyton where different lands come to the top of a tree and a bunch of kids have the most awesome experiences there. This was my favourite book as a child. The cloud forest came really close to bringing that experience to life. A breathtaking architectural wonder that has brought nature into a dome is one way of describing the place. A cool mist from a thunderous waterfall is what greets you as you enter the dome and then the exotic flora takes over. I haven't seen anything quite like it ever before and I recommend it highly to anyone that visits Singapore!
,,Great!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the Cloud Forest dome. Take the lift to the top and work your way down.

Of course the flowers are beautiful, and laid out in a really interesting way, however the architecture allows for great views of the city as well.

I think tourists have to buy a combined ticket for both domes: westerners may want to spend more time in this one."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Outstanding creativity art, architecture, horticulture. Loved the Lego carnivorous plants and the reflecting pond area. Not to be missed"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is one of the 2 domes in gardens of the bay, a beautiful piece of architecture and landscape. When you have time a must see, its lovely."
,,"Very well done, thumbs up for the creators!",5.0,,"We took a trip here with our 4 year old, its pretty cool how it has been designed. Although we really aren't into plants it was a great 40 mins out of the heat of the day and my son loved the walkways."
,,Cloud Forest at MArina Bay,4.0,,"Really good to visit, I kept waiting for a T-Rex to call out, maybe something they can think about, well worth seeing."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,A bit different from the usual layout and very interesting gardens indoor and outdoor with lovely walks
,,Wonderful,5.0,,This place is amazing and you feel like you are in another world. The range of flora and the beautiful exhibits make the visit worthwhile.
,,hope never lose our real forest lets go green,5.0,,"when first time im get in,looking for the waterfall wahhhh...so cooooll hehe.i sit near there for a while to feel the atmosphere.lay down on the bench hahaha but just for a minute.the area very calm with waterfall sound.they making this cloud forest like a real forest.when go upstair around have many kind plants from round the world,we can learn the type.oh yeah in the room they have stalaknit rock incredible.love this place.but ticket cost 25$ buy in chinatown tourist information near Buddha Tooth Relic Temple(back door).If on the spot the price is 28$ .oh the price is for flower dome too.so its pretty worthed for pay the maintanance"
,,A Dome with it all,5.0,,"From stepping into this dome you are overwelmed by the stunning tropical pants to the worlds tallest indoor waterfall and interactive discovery zones.You can go behind the waterfall and view through the cascading water and walk on sky walks high up into the dome with stunning photo oportunities, there is a secret garden section with prehistoric ferns in the misty ravine. There is a densely planted mountainside wall garden. Also the entire dome is temperature controlled so it is a welcome relief to the humidity outside.This is a must do not to be missed attraction, in a word STUNNING, Well done Singapore. You can stay here all day if you wish or have your ticket to re- enter stamped. if you wish to go out."
,,Tropical paradise,5.0,,"After experiencing the dome next door, one wonders exactly what to expect in the Cloud Forest. Well, it's a tropical paradise of immense proportions. Built around a hollow central 'mountain', complete with waterfalls, the amount of tropical shrubbery and vines is staggering. The design of the whole place, including suspended walkways, is magnificent. The care and planning involved so that every plant is healthy and lives in harmony with its neighbour is a credit to the place. Another must-see attraction in Singapore!!"
,,Nice but cold,3.0,,"Expected more fro plants. Please bring a socket though it is very cold inside. The movies and informations about global warmings are interesting and shocked us but the mountain itself was disappointing. I thought I could see more plants and more about the changing within the temperatures. I just payed for the cloud forest, my boyfriend.also played for the florest drone. After the visit I was glad paying just for one.."
,,See this first!,4.0,,"When you go to Gardens by the Bay, go see the cloud forest first because you will definitely spend a lot of time completing the entire forest. It's beautifully made and has a huge waterfall right in the middle of it! Sometimes there is a long line to get in, but this is one thing you don't want to miss in the Gardens. Also don't miss the light show."
,,not bad,4.0,,"interesting concept, quite cool. gives you the feeling of a si-fi movie rather than a walk in a forest, worth it"
,,Unique Forest,5.0,,"Man made waterfall inside dome with vertical garden, the best thing loved is that there's bridge so we can walk around and view from outside. Mist blow out during certain hours make us feel like in real forest..."
,,Artificial Waterfall,5.0,,"Super like the scenery, the weather & all the concept of it. Sometimes we have to use warm clothes, because of the weather (sometimes it's so cool)."
,,Great experience for children,5.0,,"I have never imagined that I can feel being in a forest in such a big city. It is really worthed to visit. Children can see a waterfall and feel the breeze and the atmosphere being in a forest. So many kinds of flora can be found,so they can learn something while enjoying their holiday."
,,A nice experience that educates too,5.0,,"It is a p[lace where you can experience the rain forests as well as learn a lot about them.

There is also an ongoing movie that educates you about global warming.

You could either climb up or go up by lift and then stroll down (we did the latter). There are information boards and factoids all over. Do go with at least an hour with you."
,,Taken by our Hosts,5.0,,Beautiful place to visit - GREAT idea to bring guests there and see more of Singapore. i would go back again
,,"Helpful staff, Excellet service",5.0,,"I came to Singapore with my husband when he was posted here. My 5 year olds child also followed.
I have stayed here for 2 months, We need that the staff here are very patient and helpful.
My child is very playful, He always make a mess of the place. However, Ms chingching tidied the room patiently.Sometimes, she even cleaned the room twice in a day to ensure that the room was in good condition. The supervisor, Xiaoli, is also very helpful. She always have a smiling face. She visited us regularly and saw how we were settling down. We have told her our requirements if any and she would try her best to fulfill our needs.
My family including my child likes them very much. When we checked out , they bought some chocolates for my child.
We would like to thank Chingching and Xiaoli very much.
We can feel that our family was very happy staying here and we will surely come back."
,,"Beautiful, Cool (Temperature Wise, Very Nice), and Cool",5.0,,Beautiful flowers and stunning indoor area full of vegetation and waterfalls. On a hot day in Singapore this is a must. Next to our hotel which was nice.
,,Unbelievable & Amazing!,5.0,,"I was there during end of March 2015. When I stepped into it, I couldn't believe my eyes. It was altogether a different world. Walking through it was much more exiting and its a wonderland for photographers. When I was there, it was raining out side but not a drop inside - just amazing. Artificial waterfalls was just a treat to watch and drench. See it to believe it. A miss not place."
,,some achievement,5.0,,"This is one of the things that have to be paid for in the gardens by the bay., if I remember (last week ) about £8 , but very much worth it, the central feature is a large waterfall, you take a lift to the top and then walk your way down a very high kind of skywalk enjoying all the plants ect growing on the side of the ""mountain "" Take your time theres more to see than you may think"
,,Awesome,5.0,,We visited here as they opened before it got too hot and too crowded. The Domes open at 9am and cost $12 each to go through. We started at the top and my husband who is scared of heights loved it so much he asked if we could do it again! Then work your way down each level to the Secret Garden. Is air conditioned as well so a very good comfort level.
,,Very nice,4.0,,Great to include to the visit to the gardens at marina. Tickets for both Flower dome and Cloud forest are 28$. 20 $ for a single ticket. Worth the visit and spend half a day
,,Worth the time,5.0,,Well worth the time to take in this attraction. A great view of the forest from the walk.Would do it again.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"When you are at the Gardens by the bay, you might as well visit the flower dome and the cloud forest. It is very well done, nice and cool air, a good escape from the heat of Singapore."
,,Rainforest walk,5.0,,"With all the mist and the huge waterfall at the entrance, makes you feel like you are walking among the clouds...lovely experience that is hard to find anywhere else."
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,Every about it is awesome! Lot of good photo-op as well as creates great awareness about deforestation! Orchid all around!
,,lovely!!,5.0,,must visit place especially during summers!! a good change and you will feel in lap of nature...dont miss it!!
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"Truly a wonderful experience. As usual, Singapore goes all out. And a wonderful way to cool down from the hot weather outside! Very refreshing."
,,A must see unique to Singapore.,5.0,,Highly recommended. Obviously is very humid and you might get splashed near the water fall so be careful if you have a fancy camera. 10 out of 10.
,,Misting time,5.0,,"Awesome place to check out on a hot day. If you manage to be there for misting time (every 2 hours I think), you get to experience a cool mist as well. Really well done, not only for looking at things but also just to spend time. Well worth a slow walk around."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,This man made mountain complete with waterfall is a must to see and experience. When the sprayers come on it forms a mist which adds to the ambiance of the dome. The walkways on the various levels extending out from the mountain provide some great views of the various gardens.
,,Amazing! Let's all heed the call to take care of the environment.,5.0,,"The concept is just fantastic: you are entering a forest where you can see all kinds of plants from the different layers, from the ground to the clouds! The walkways are accessible to wheelchair-bound and baby stroller-riding tourists. Tip for the lift-riders: there are 4 lifts at the back, and these would be better used to shuttle between floors (versus the lone lift that goes all the way to the 7th level). There are baby-friendly facilities. I especially like the +5 degrees showcase. We should all take care of our environment, lest we find ourselves left with artificial forests :("
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"The cloud forest is definitely worth a visit, huge waterfall inside the conservatory, different levels to view, walkways if you don't mind heights (if you do there are lifts to each level and you can still have a bit of a look around).

Definitely pay to go in if you are at Gardens by the Bay."
,,Adventurous walk,4.0,,In-the-sky walk to overview the whole garden and it is amazing. There are several layers that i could take a look on different plants on different layers by less than 1 meter.
,,Best of two biodomes at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"I loved this place! Being from California, there were many plants I had never seen before and it was really a unique experience. A must do when you go to Gardens by the Bay, and worth the entrance fee."
,,Expensive but beautiful,4.0,,"Very pretty tower structure in the centre covered in plants, a large waterfall and lots of walkways at different levels. Was good fun and something unusual to find in a city. Kind of like the Eden Project."
,,Waterfall was good...,4.0,,"The best part of the place was the man made waterfall, so very refreshing. Rest was probably for a botany or flowers lover."
,,Different,4.0,,Different in a good way....something we did not expect within walking distance of the hotel! Well worth getting a duel ticket for this and the Flower Dome.
,,Amazing creation,5.0,,"A must visit place... inside, you will find sky walk bridge.. enthrilled with the experience... best time to visit is in the evening when the sun is about to set... in the lights, you will enjoy the experience. a marvelous piece of creation..."
,,In the cloud..,5.0,,"Getting here is through BAYFRONT MRT, upon exit, you will already see directions to the Gardens by the Bay.

You can purchase just CLOUD DOME or FLOWER DOME. I strongly recommend you get both.

Cloud dome forest is a great experience to see all sorts of plants thats all over the world. Some i have seen at books only. So it's quite amazing to see them right before your eyes. I also saw some plants that was originated from my country but I never actually saw them back home. Its educational too especially if you have kids.

It's like you're learning together. Educational tour. Just a fun way way to learn.

I strongly recommend cloud dome forest."
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,"Saw the cloud at night, water fall was just stunning, the tree top walk was beautiful, well worth the visit"
,,unreal and breathtaking,4.0,,"It has a magnificent water fall, many feature and a meandering walkway starting at the top of the trees."
,,Cool and awesome,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest feel like you are really on mountain top with cloud resting on it. Sever floors of awesomeness and extremely wheelchair friendly. I recommend you visit this place in the day time as the place is dimly lit at night.

The information center at the 'Canopy' (Ticketing Area) offers wheel chairs on rent for $2 (they keep your passport as a deposit)."
,,The Cloud Forest is aptly named!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a unique way to experience flora - you ride an elevator to the top of an artificial mountain and walk down ""board"" walks which weave in and out of the ""mountain"" seeing all sorts of plants/flowers on the way. Brilliant photo opportunities as you go. If you suffer from vertigo try and brave it is worthwhile."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"My boyfriend and I loved it! Loads of photo time. The waterfall is amazing, although it's only man-made."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"I loved my visit to the Cloud Forest. While a little too humid for some, especially with Singapore's already-high humidity, the place left me with a feeling of wonderment. It was also nice to find a tiny piece of amazing greenery, right in the heart of one of the most urban cities in the world.

One issue I did have though was the wait for the elevator, for you to start your tour of the main ""mountain"" from the top. That could perhaps be better managed.

All in all, it's not the cheapest diversion the area has to offer, but it's well worth at least a first visit. Don't miss out the magnificent Flower Dome either."
,,Excellent and well designed,5.0,,"My wife and I hadn't planned on visiting here as we only found out about it while walking through the Gardens by the Bay.
We are so pleased we did as it was amazing and we enjoyed the design and displays. We weren't in a rush and spent over an hour here.
We recommend visiting here along with the Orchid Garden."
,,A Great Experience,5.0,,"Anyone going to Singapore, even for a few days, must make an effort to see the Cloud Forest at the Gardens by the Bay complex. Very accessible since it's in the center of town, and once you're inside, you will not think that you are in the middle of a concrete jungle city!

The experience leaves one feeling elated and on ""cloud nine"". Best for families with children, but also old people."
,,Amazing Structure...,3.0,,"Its for sure one of the most amazing buildings in Singapore. It has many nice plants and is very beautifully arranged.

If you are a big fan if indoor plants you will se many nice thing.

But its not my number recommendation when you are in Singapore. The Gardens By The bay outside are worth the visit. Its not really necessary to go in"
,,Tallest indoor waterfall in the world,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest, (located next to the flower dome) at the ""Gardens by the Bay"" complex is simply incredible. Designed to imitate a ""cloud forest"" environment (a high mountainous climate zone), the central structure in the dome is a man made mountain (about 7 stories high) with various plants thriving on all sides and an amazing waterfall . It replicates one of the world's most fragile environments. A variety of paths are available at varying level, including a few sky walks. The dome is air conditioned to keep the climate appropriately cool. Access is by lift, stairs and / or escalators so it is a very accessible site. A number of specially designed gardens have been constructed with varied plantings, sculptures and other features. The complex is misted at certain times of the day, so you may get a little damp. Access the Gardens by the Complex from the Bayfront MRT Station (follow the signs) or the nearby Marina Bay Sands. A shuttle is available from the MRT exit ($2 round trip) if you do not wish to walk the 10 or so minutes through the various gardens before the domes. Entry is $20 SGD or $28SGD for the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forrest). Well worth a visit and allow plenty of time in your itinerary. There are food stalls and a gift shop onsite."
,,Up in the Clouds is Cool! (cold!!),5.0,,"Loved this, it was like a highlight of our visit. the waterfall was incredible and walking up the spiral of path was something I will never forget! All those pretty flora and fauna, vines, ferns and birds."
,,NICE and COOL,4.0,,the doom was really great and attractive. you need to walk every floor they build and wlak in the hanging brige.
,,WOW,5.0,,"its fascinating when enter the building,, the building design its so nice,,, a huge waterfall welcoming me when i enter the building,, if u bring a spare t-shirt you can stand under the waterfall,, the interesting one is the misting time,, on specific time the mist came out in all direction and cover the cloud forest,,, it really makes me standing in the top of the mountain with mist surrounding me..."
,,Nothing prepares you !,5.0,,"Singapore is filled with spectacular buildings and sights. The cloud forest is a visit to
A future environmental plant bubble the 7 storey high waterfall with a lift built into it and the walking trails circling and descending around the waterfall make this one of the most impressive attractions we have been to. Well worth the visit. Its under cover and airconditioned."
,,Interesting and different,4.0,,"A lovely garden of mountain plants, it is cool, misty and very well constructed. A good place to come after a walk in the gardens or before a visit to the shopping centre at Marina Sands.

If you are in the area later, a re-entry stamp will let you see this when the dome and plants are lit up."
,,A very nice walk in a surprising environment.,5.0,,You will spend a very good time there. It's a real change from the city atmosphere and absolutely not boring
,,Amazing if it is your first time,4.0,,Nothing much has changed since it first began operation. Although it would most definitely be a unique experience for first timers. Spend a couple of hours between the two attractions and take a stroll in the Gardens after the sun has set.
,,A very surprising feature,5.0,,Its educational as well as physical features meant it was a learning experience for all ages. Worth the money and complimentary to the rest
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"Not knowing what to expect, the cloud dome is a learning experience for young and old. The structure in the middle of the dome is walkable, has cold running water, and is a photographer's delight. There is so much going on in this dome! Beware, it is cold and you need to walk up the middle structure to take in the full beauty!"
,,Misty and wet artificial forest,4.0,,"I like this artificial forest, but I think the best time to visit it is in the day instead of night, so you can see better."
,,WOW,5.0,,Fantastic botanical attraction which has to be experienced to be believed! Waterfall and vegetation fantastic and the skywalk pathways allow you to see close-ups within the dome and great visas outside the dome. Not to be missed!
,,Unbelieveable,5.0,,"This place is created like a cloud forest around a water fall. This allows you to see all the exotic plants and orchids which grow on high altitude cloud forests around the world. Must see with your kids, great way to learn about nature."
,,just loved it..,5.0,,Loved it a lot. The government has taken pains to teach the importance of Ecological preservation in a beautiful way. documentary shown at the end of tour was educational.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Located inside Gardens by the bay, superbly built and beyond imagination, kids loved it. U need atleast 1 hour to explore it. Enjoyed to the core."
,,Great,5.0,,"Very lush and tropical, beautiful views, well thought out, walkways, even lift for the elderly or wheelchairs."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,The exhibitions were of a extremely high quality. A pleasure to behold. Man made marvel. We could have spent the whole day in the area with so much to see
,,Architectually amazing,4.0,,I thought this was the best part of the Gardens by the Bay attraction. Even though I don't like heights I found the sky walk really beautiful and am sure that in a few years time once all the plants are bigger it will look even more amazing
,,See it with the Flower Dome,5.0,,"and walk through the surrounding gardens too. A typically Singaporean feat of construction has created an indoor rain forest (but the ""rain"", which is a mist, is predictable and not really wet!)"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Welcome all. From the moment I entered the Cloud Forest, I was blown away by it's architectural beauty. The large waterfall that greets you in spectacular, not to mention, nice and refreshing on a hot day. The dome is climate controlled, which gives to the sense of relief. The walk up amongst the cloud, the plants/gardens are extremely well maintained. Full credit must go to the carers of this place. The views of the outside world, from inside the dome, makes this location ideal for such an attraction. Well done to the brain behind this. So everyone, spend the small amount to view this beautiful sight, because you never know when you will see this type of attraction again. I visited this 3 times in 2 separate visits to Singapore in 2 months. So go do it. I guarantee, you won't be disappointed."
,,NOT TO BE MISSED.,5.0,,A great attraction allow plenty of time and bring a jacket as temperature in this building are very cool
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"This place is incredible! It is a must visit in singapore.

The closest mrt station is bayfront station. But it takes like 20 minutes walk to get to the dome. I suggest that those with walking difficulty to take taxi there.

Nearby attractions: marina bay sands. There is a daily free light show at marina bay sands. I think there is 2 shows daily. One at 7.30pm and another at 9.30pm. You need to check on marina bay sands website for the actual timing. You can go to the garden in the afternoon and then go and watch the light show at marina bay sands at night. Bayfront station is linked to marina bay sands."
,,A note re pricing,5.0,,"We only had time to do one of the domes and chose the Cloud Forest. Really well done and worth it. It's just that I was under the impression (from researching TA and from the signs at the ticket office) that only Singaporeans could pay to just do one dome while other tourists had to buy tickets for both domes. We asked at the ticket office if we could just do the Cloud Dome and they said yes, charge was S$18. We also timed it well (purely by chance) for when they release ""mist"", so it may be worthwhile finding out those times before you go. It was a nice cool break from the Singapore heat."
,,A forest under cover,5.0,,"Waterfalls, trees, stalactytes, skywalk,all beautifully displayed and maintained. Good value for money and a must for any visitors to Singapore"
,,Cool,4.0,,"You will see an artificial waterfall as walking in. It was cold there and lots of trees, spectacular flowers. Enjoy the skywalk from height."
,,Over-hyped than actual,3.0,,Not worth spending money. There are far better places to visit in singapore. So visitor you can skip it if you feel.
,,Incredibly Imaginative,5.0,,"This attraction was closed for renovation when we went to the Flower Dome at Gardens on the Bay and we almost didn't bother going back but we were so glad we did. My husband and I love beautiful gardens and living in Melbourne, Australia we could never dream of growing the plants they do in Singapore. Whoever had the idea to build these domes and the gardens both inside and outside the domes is a genius and should be congratulated."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Very good attraction, with plenty of stunning flowers and shrubs, all set in a rainforest background,. Well worth the entrance fee."
,,Cloud Forrest,5.0,,What an amazing day. As soon as you step through the doors you look up at the waterfall and the truly spectacular feature in front of you.
,,Wonderfull Oasis in a hot city,5.0,,"Loved this place they dont call it the cloud forest for nothing
Your greeted by the cooling air and the waterfall
Bring you camera plenty of photo opportunities here
from flowers to trees stalictights to stalicmites
this place is well worth the visit time it right and see the lights in the gardens by the bay n the way out
best seen i feel late afternoon into evening"
,,cloud forest visit was great,5.0,,in my review about the gardens by the bay I mentioned the 2 domes my kids spotted from the big trees and so we went to both of them. One of them contains the cloud forest a climate like in New Zealand s south island with an huge artificial but nice waterfall. Really worth the visit and to cool down from the heat. It's a bit pricey though. Try to get a combination ticket.
,,"Oasis, cool and engaging",5.0,,"What a wonderful oasis in the heart of humid Singapore! This amazing architectural and botanical tour de force is well worth the price of the ticket. If short of time, just choose the Cloud Forest and only include the Flower Dome if you have more time.
I travelled up to the very top and wandered down slowly through the airborne walkways including behind the waterfall. All the plants were in excellent condition and many were blooming. I was especially intrigued by the exotic orchids and the pool at the top level with planted platforms.
The architecture of the dome is spectacular in itself and has won several awards. However, I couldn't help thinking, is this the future of vegetation on our planet? Let's hope not and meanwhile enjoy the calm, cool atmosphere here before re-entering the tropical heat of the city of Singapore."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"Really enjoyed this, a great respite on a hot day. Do not need long here, an hour at most however just a very relaxing and interesting pace to be. Seemed expensive for entry but then again isn't everything in singapore. Take a cardi or wrap with you, gets chilly"
,,what a fantasic garden,5.0,,"this is one of the best dome gardens I have seen, couldn't believe the plants could survive in the air condition"
,,Dont miss this,4.0,,"Simply wonderful! Manmade waterfall, super trees light show and very scenic. Most importantly airconditioned and very relaxing.
Its worth your money unlike some places in Singapore which are ridiculously over priced and touristy. Has an elevator so makes it easy for oldies and kids to move about.
You can get combo tickets with The Gardens to visit."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"What an array of plants, breathtaking. I thought I would be a bit nervous of the height of the walk and the length of it. But I didn't feel in the least bit nervous and enjoyed every bit of it."
,,One of Singapore icon - A must visit place for all tourist,5.0,,Take your time to enjoy beautiful flowers and landscape in a cool and comfortable environment. I went during the Tulipmania festival and the tulips are just beautiful. They just made your day brighter and happier.
,,A pleasant surprise,5.0,,"Due to limited time we had to chose between the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. I think we chose very well.
What a surprise to walk into the huge glass dome to beautiful cool air and a cascading waterfall.
In true Singapore style, nothing is done in half measures. The Cloud Forest was spectacular. The aerial walkways and 'misting' are well worth seeing.
I now wonder if we missed out by not visiting the Flower Dome?"
,,"Very cool, literally",4.0,,"Another attraction at the Marina Bay area. The inside simulates a rain forest, complete with indoor waterfall. Admission gets you into Flower Field and Cloud Forest domes. Worth a visit."
,,Stunning display,5.0,,What a feat of botanical architecture. This dome is amazing and the quality of the plants took our breath away. A definite must see on any ones list
,,Cooooool,5.0,,"The waterfall, the trees, the mist, the train, the plants, the people, the location and everything, yes trust me, everything of this place was a bliss!! And your trip to the gardens by the bay is incomplete without the cloud forest."
,,Very impressive construction,5.0,,"Like the Botanic Gardens just next to it, the Cloud Forest is a huge Greenhouse with thousands of different plants, thus enriching the air with high oxygen levels, high humidity (but actually still lower then outside) and very pure air. Great feeling being in there and interesting as well."
,,Wow,5.0,,We didn't know what to expect but we thoroughly enjoyed walking through this lovely cool area with the spectacular waterfall and the beautiful plants everywhere.
,,Indoor warerfall and escape the heat,4.0,,"The main feature of Cloud Forest is the spectacular and massive waterfall. Nice and misty and wet when you walk in so this is a good opportunity to escape the often oppressive Singapore humidty whilst seeing a nicely simulated rainforest environment. The other main part is the long and winding walkway as you desend through the display.

Also look out for the hidden native masks and statues throughout the foliage and the different flowers."
,,Another worth while see,5.0,,"Singapore as loads of free attractions and if you take hop on hop off bus you can see them all pick your season wisely or its hot . This is a good choice with or with out kids ,"
,,Great,4.0,,"Amazing creation, cloud waterfall is the best of all. Cloud walk also it awesome. Caution for babies it can be really cold. Take a sweater."
,,Manually Created Natural Falls/Forest,5.0,,"This place is amazing. Singaporeans wanted a falls and forest atmosphere within their reach. Since they are not naturally blessed with one, they have created one and this place is an amazing experience. The Air Conditioning blowing inside the doom and the falling water is amazing to have a feel"
,,Nothing great,3.0,,The cloud forest is primarily a dome which has couple of exotic flora along with an artificial waterfall. For those of you who have seen the real deal wouldn't find this interesting at all. For about 20SGD. I didn't find anything great about it. Maybe good for family with kids to pass time.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"We loved the cloud forest. And be sure you bring a jumper as it is cool in there. The variety and display of plants was amazing and beautiful. Plan to stay for a while as there are some interesting displays within 'the mountain'. if you have mobility problems there is a lift to get you to each level.If not enjoy the scenic walkways and be amazed . We do think the entry price is too expensive and felt unfairly treated that we had to pay even more than the locals.
Having said that we highly recommend a visit here as it is truly amazing. We spent the whole day exploring gardens by the bay and could have easily spent another day exploring some of the parts we missed the first day."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I liked the difference in the way you moved up the waterfall onto different levels and the mini exhibits within each level, stone sculptures and rock formations. I did not like the spray as you first walked in as it was right as you walked through the door. Due to the humidity be careful with cameras."
,,Indoor waterfall + a/c,5.0,,"Wow!! The waterfall is the center-piece of the whole place, and it also has a tunnels and stairs behind it. Each level has a lookout points for a different view of the exhibit from behind the fall. There's also a skywalk at the top- well worth the entrance fee."
,,end of cruise,5.0,,what an array of plants this was a great place to visit nice and cool inside here escape the heat well worth the visit
,,Haven for Nature-lovers,5.0,,Advised to bring a jacket along as the place is quite cold. A wide collection of flora collected from different places and presented at one place. A must visit for nature-lovers who have a good knowledge of the horticulture.
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,What an inspirational place to visit the concept & constructon to push the world to consider what we are doing to our enviroment is explained very much down to earth excellent well worth the money
,,"Interesting, but not impressive",3.0,,"The second you walk into the Cloud Forest dome, you're struck by its humungous waterfall. It is then that one reaches the peak of excitement. Following this is a series of elevator rides, escalator walks, and slow meanderings along a steel gangway. Interestingly set up, but by no means impressive or informative.

If you have to choose one, go to the Flower Dome. If you have an extra 30 minutes, add the Cloud Forest too."
,,We did this with speed.,4.0,,Due to not wanting to walk back to the MRT and the last train ride back was soon (as we spent so long at the gardens) we did the cloud forest VERY fast. It was good and would have loved to stay longer for a decent view.
,,Worth the visit!,5.0,,Excellent - quite amazing views! Do this alongside the Cloud domes and a trip to Marina Sands. Get off the MRT at Bayside. Bayside station is directly connected to Marina Bay shopping centre.
,,Just like the real thing.,5.0,,"Wonderfully put together, you get a real feeling of being out in the wilderness and get to see really rare plants, which are well cared for, one will visit here to see and feel the beauty of the nature that is displayed and that is exactly what you get. Well worth a visit. Best to get a combo ticket with gardens as well."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The doors opened and a cool breeze hits you with a huge waterfall, amazing place, enjoyed walking around it, so hot that day"
,,Excelent concept,5.0,,The closest you can get to a natural cloud forest in Singapore. Worth the visit. The view from the top is great no to mention the waterfalls...
,,gobsmacked,5.0,,"from the time we entered this to the time we left just left me speechless, the waterfall the gardens the flowers just everything was amazing
cave formations, lego
when i transit or even stay again in singapore i will be doing this one again and get some more video footage if 2000 photos isnt enough

you get transported into a lush forest and scenic views"
,,A cooling experience.,5.0,,Cool air blows through louvers' up and down the mountain. The orchids and insectivorous plants are excellent.
,,Worth A Second Visit,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience, so much so that on a second trip to Singapore I went back. The Cloud Forest is a part of the Gardens by the Bay which includes various types open air gardens including the Flower Dome and Supertrees with a Skywalk (per person is S$5). The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are enclosed in massive air conditioned glass and steel domes ... an interesting engineering feat.

The Cloud Forest is a great place for singles, couples or entire families and is interesting, educational and a wonder to see. One gets a great understanding of the ecological system and how earth receives it's moisture. The first thing one encounters upon entering is a 35 meter waterfall ... then take the elevator to the top floor to the Lost World and work your way down and through the other various levels. Every two hours 'the mist' is turned on at the top and the feeling is something to be experienced. The mist is an integral part of earth's ability to survive and all this is well explained.

Take the MRT and then walk underground to the Gardens by the Bay ... excellent signage to get you there. Then upon arrival pay the S$2 and hop on a small trolley which will take you to the main two Domes. Purchase your ticket.

One piece of advise ... I would go to see the Supertrees and take the Skywalk first and then come back to the Domes. Reason ... it is hot and the Supertrees are all outdoors and the air conditioning is a welcome relief from the heat."
,,Lovely Experience,4.0,,Very Serene and beautiful exotic plants to admire. Many of the plants resemble the rainforests of Borneo so some great examples on show and the Orchids are stunning.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"One of my favourite parts of my holiday, the Fall was incredible and I explored every little bit and read all the information which I really enjoyed reading! I highly recommend that if you're in Singapore that this is a must see."
,,Can be avoided,3.0,,"Nothing great, except for the man mae waterfall. It can be avoided. Though it is worth a visit for the first timers."
,,You Can Walk on the Sky Here,5.0,,"When you enter the entrance, you will welcoming by the giant waterfalls with the superb natural dolby surround sound.
Just look up to the sky and you will see the cloud made from dew, you will feels like on the outer space site.
This venue is also have different floor with different amazing sightseeing. You can also walk in the sky in this place.
Amazing..."
,,Fantasy-land,5.0,,"It is a brilliant piece of engineering with concrete structures clad with so much greenery. Beautiful flowers and leaves cover ever bit of space and the climb down the winding ramp is fascinating. This was one of our finest experiences in Singapore. The best part is that this is one visit that one can do irrespective of the rains outside since we are fully protected.
Great job!!"
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"This is a must see. How do people even get the ideas for such amazing features? A 35metre indoor mountain and waterfall. And every one should be made watch the videos about what we are doing to the earth. I am terrified of heights, but I just had to go on the skywalks to appreciate the structures. The Flower dome and the Cloud Forest do not harm the environment either."
,,Wonderful Forest,5.0,,The cloud Forest was amazing highly recommend the view and what was around every corner was a must see.
,,Beautiful cool oasis,5.0,,Huge waterfall and beautiful flowers in a wonderful setting liked being able to walk up to the top of the dome and the amazing view
,,It was ok,3.0,,"I'm not a fan of plants and nature, but it was ok, very beautiful. If you stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, it is very convenient, they have shuttle bus."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"You are ""greeted "" at the door by huge waterfall that you can hear throughout the whole visit. Incredible work to put the rainforest together under the roof. Fascinating place. A bit cold inside."
,,Wonderful greenhouse,5.0,,"Fantastic building, terrific planting, good temperature and excellent to catch the lift to the top and come down the levels."
,,A paradise in a box,5.0,,"Before I go, I though was boring, just another rain forest in Singapore, but in thuth I was wrong. In the entrance I saw the big waterfall and lots of orchids... I felt in love! You walk around the ""mountain"" from de sky to the center of earth. In the end, don't miss the video +5 degree impact. We see what we do with our planet and how to improve. One of must see in Singapore. I loved the cloud forest."
,,No clouds to be found here...,2.0,,"I had magical ideas about the cloud forest and what it'd be like. It was anything but magical. A man made attraction which is kind of boring. Gardens By The Bay is done better, but still very man made and sterile."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"A must see to believe, beautiful , something that has to be seen to be believed . Best time to go is early before the massive crowds and tour groups arrive. Later in the day it will get extremely crowded and can become very loud."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,This place is amazing with a huger waterfall and very cool conditions in a tropical zone. The vertical garden type set up is the best I have ever seen
,,"Great for families, bring a jacket",4.0,,"Great effort in recreating a rainforest feel. Good outing for a family with young kids, so bring the kids .... and a jacket!"
,,"Worth a visit, with kids even more",3.0,,"The Cloud Forest is basically an artificial hill fully covered with a vivid variety of rainforest flora, surrounded by elevated walking paths and featuring even waterfalls. The whole thing packed under an impressive glass dome.
I think it is definitely worth a visit if you are around, and I would definitely recommend it for families with children between 5 - 14.
Be aware, it is quite cold and very humid inside.
You can walk around and see everything in 30 to 60 minutes."
,,The mist in Singapore,4.0,,"You take an elevator to the top of a tall structure covered in greenery. There are walkways that spiral around this structure. I highly recommend to go during the times it is misting. The whole area looks like a rainforest. There is also a waterfall.

No problems if walking is difficult because they have elevators and escalators.
I spent about 40 minutes here."
,,Interesting place and you can feel/smell the difference in the air with all the negative ions.,4.0,,"The cloud walk was interesting but may not be suitable if you have vertigo... The temperature was controlled and mimic highlands especially of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. Flowers were in bloom everywhere."
,,Glad was not busy,5.0,,"We were lucky that we picked a quite time to attend the Domes,
Cloud Forest was very interesting and I usually have an issue with heights but I was fine on the walkways as they feel very secure, there is a small glass floor near the waterfall which had me a little hesitant, but all up I really enjoyed the layout and felt I was walking down a small mountain, I love gardening and found the plants used very interesting, there are a few areas that stand out.
As long as it's not too busy and your not getting pushed along it can be a relaxing stroll back down."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"You spend a lot to take a quick walk through here. It's an impressive feat of engineering, I suppose. Very cold inside, bring a sweater."
,,AMAZING!!!!,5.0,,This place is beautiful. A man made waterfall was just lovely and very cooling. The walk was just like being in a rain forest. So many varieties of flowers. Very relaxing and calming
,,Very clever and a great place to keep cool,5.0,,AMAZING. So incredibly clever what has been created here it is well worth the entry free. Also beautifully cool on those super hot days.
,,Stunning Attraction,5.0,,"Firstly, if you don't like heights, this won't be suitable for you. If heights don't worry you, this place is amazing. As soon as you enter, you are confronted by voluminous waterfall which topples over this mountain that has been constructed in an enormous glass house. Plants grow profusely up the sides of the mountain and you take a lift up six floors, then climb one more floor to reach a cloud garden on top. The vegetation is lush and beautiful. Walkways extend out from the mountain to give you brilliant views of both the foliage and the sights of Singapore. This attraction has true Wow factor and definitely worth a visit."
,,Amazing gardens in a beautiful location,5.0,,"Easy to get to, very tranquil setting. Not expected in such a compact place as Singapore. Although the walkways are only about 22m off the ground, they provide a view of the gardens that makes the place look very Jurassic!"
,,Quite a good replica given the museum setting!,3.0,,"It idid remind me of the real thing, not a bad imitation But of course nothing like the real thing really; far too clean for a start!"
,,A beautiful botanical garden,5.0,,"Loved seeing all the beautiful tropic flowers, waterfall plants. A nice way too cool off from the heat of the city"
,,Best Place to Visit,5.0,,The cloud forest is absolutely breathtaking and a must visit. The way the whole structure and gardens are designed is just amazing and the thought and design behind the same is phenomenal. Kudos to the whole team behind this marvel.
,,Cool and Relaxing,5.0,,"A great place to visit to escape the Singapore heat. Inside the forest it's very cool. Quite informative as you walk along the canopy walks.

Great opportunities for photographs of various plants and of the Marina Bay Hotel and Big Wheel.

You can walk between various locations or catch a shuttle bus. Plenty of different food outlets, restaurants on site.

If you decide to visit both domes and you take your boarding pass you will receive 10% discount."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,An absolutely amazing experience - a highlight of our stopover in Singapore. Well with the admission charge and highly recommended.
,,man made waterfall,5.0,,Good attempt to create the man made waterfall in a coastal city. feel like you are roaming in a himalayan city
,,Prefer the Flower Dome,5.0,,"Personally I prefer the Flower Dome because of the changing exhibits and ""prettier"" look. :) Cloud Forest can come once a year maybe but Flower Dome can come every quarter...I bought my e-tickets twice from BeMyGuest and enjoyed my experience both times!"
,,My favourite place to be,5.0,,"Cloud forest takes you 7 floors up from the ground and its a pretty amazing sight. An indoor forest with the highest indoor waterfall and the place is chill by air-conditioning with many exotic plants. For the best experience, take the lift all the way up the highest floor and walk down to each level until the ground floor.
On the highest floor you may experienced an amazing architecture of the building overseeing the ocean and Singapore Flyer.
There's an entrance fee of $27 (that allows entry to both cloud forest and flower dome). Check online for promotion. We got free tulips flower in conjunction of mothers day and labour weekend."
,,A must see in Singapore - nature lover or otherwise,5.0,,"Sooooooo green. The entire walk through the Cloud Forest is breathtaking - not to mention a breath of fresh air on a humid day. There's a huge manmade waterfall and plenty of suspended walkways that offer great views. If you have to choose between this dome or the Flower Dome, go with this one."
,,"The walk down ""the cloud"" can be scary for people with height phobia",4.0,,"It's a great experience walking down from top level. As the floor can be see thru, my dad with height phobia was totally turn off."
,,Cloud Forest at Garden by Bay,5.0,,"This beautiful man made ""mountain"", complete with waterfall, is host to a huge array of orchids, ferns and exotic plants, all enclosed within the giant ""greenhouse"". The temperature is cool and pleasant, so a great place to escape the hot humid Singapore afternoons."
,,Great place to go,4.0,,This is great but I love the Flower Dome more. Anyway it's still a great place to visit. I love the way Singapore introduces the nature world to us and in the same time educates us many other things.
,,A Masterpiece,5.0,,"take your time in it, enjoy the place, enjoy the atmosphere, read every info about the beautiful flora in this dome, simply try to appreciate the effort, time, money that it cost to build such an amazing & beautiful place. as a tourist the price is little high but it worth every penny, for local i guess the price is very reasonable, just try to thing how hard to create that chilling & foggy weather inside the dome & keep the plants in excellent condition."
,,Orchids galore!,5.0,,"A beautiful cloud rainforest inside the dome with many species of flowers and plants, a beautiful outlay that leads you to the top. However if you're scared of heights try to make it to the top and walk along the bridges, there are hand rails you can hold onto even though there are signs that don't recommend walking ahead it's definitely something not to miss out on! Also educational which I might add."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"Very nice mixing of engineering and art. The very nature of place was quite fascinating and the ideas which was implemented was creative, informative and exciting."
,,average,3.0,,It's a tower with plants and mist. Don't mind to go if you are free. It need some walk but great with air-cond.
,,Splendid light and music show,5.0,,I like the light Garden Rhapsody show with the visual and sound effects at night at the Supertrees.I also enjoyed the Heritage garden(In particular the Chinees garden)
,,Serene!,4.0,,"For photographers, a must go. The waterfall would make you sit there for eternity. It is so amazing. The artificially created cloud forest is really a masterpiece. A must visit."
,,Great place to relax,4.0,,"Once again, lost of people, but because the area is to vast, was never a problem. A nice place to just relax and take your time"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Climate controlled to help beat that Singapore Heat. Great way to spend a day. Get there early and enjoy the scenery
,,Best ever,5.0,,To me it may not be cheap but going up the cloud forest is truly unforgettable and is worst every penny or cent. A visitor to Singapore should never ever miss going up this cloud forest.
,,Camera went into overdrive,5.0,,Love love love this place. The waterfall is brilliant. The only thing not sure about was the crystals. The wood carvings are exceptional
,,You'll love this,5.0,,"This is just fantastic, the entrance with its thundering waterfall, climbing up to a height of ""6500"" feet, looking at the plants and the outside world from inside the dome. It took us almost 3 hours to wander around the Cloud Dome, we enjoyed it that much."
,,Don't miss this amazing place,5.0,,"This place was amazing. From the moment you enter and step into the cool refreshing dome, you will love this place. I saw so many amazing plants and flowers and the variety of orchids that I saw was amazing. This was probably my favorite place I visited while in Singapore. I would love to go back an visit this place with my family."
,,Fantastic Man made garden,5.0,,The Whole theme Forest is man made & offers a good Education to Children & adults. Lots of efforts have gone in to make the place realistic.The theme is to protect & take care of your surrounding forests. Imagination & creativity at its best
,,Well Designed...,5.0,,dont miss it....its a part of gardens by the bay. please take out more time for this place. u will feel very relaxed moving about in this place.
,,Tropical Wonder,5.0,,"Visited this place with the family on 29th Nov 2014. It is a colossal man made green house but it is a real tropical wonder with so much of vegetation, clouds wafting. dampness and water falls. We took the lift up and the walked down the ramps at leisure.

I liked the crystal mountain the maximum and the tree top trek"
,,Great For Families,4.0,,We live in a tropical country ourselves but the whole family found this fascinating and most informative. Very well presented.
,,wow is the word,5.0,,"you need to see it to believe it , it is one of the best indoor parks in the work , may be it is the best. must see in singapore"
,,Surprising package-in a good way!,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest a superbly themed attraction which really surprises the visitor. If the towering waterfall right at the entrance doesn't put you in awe, the cold air and gently drifting clouds surely will. A nice compact design ensures that you can see all there is to see in about 30 minutes. Taking the elevator to the top floor and walking down level by level is probably the best way to do it. Worth a visit."
,,Great place,4.0,,"Went to the gardens by the bay, and must admit i enjoyed the cloud forest the most. It is really well done and gives you an nice idea of how a tropical rain forest is built."
,,Amaxing,5.0,,"Fantastic oasis in a very busy land, well set out with much to see and do. Unique place to visit in Singapore. The gardens outside are also stunning. This is our second visit and it is great to see how much it has matured in this time"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is awesome again, the technology and inspiration is amazing alone the rest of it Go and enjoy I promise"
,,Pretty,4.0,,"There were a lot of exotic plants and flowers as well as great scenery. Definately should go check it out. If you stay for too long, it's a little cold."
,,"The concept is fantastic, but it is still man made",3.0,,"The concept of cloud forest is fantastic, but since its man made it has its limitations and cannot be compared with natural stuff. Its located in small area and the grandeur and awesomeness you feel in natural waterfall/ forests goes missing in this case. But overall, it can be visited once."
,,Nature lovers must see,5.0,,"The cloud forest is a beautifully made, temperature controlled dome. The waterfalls and the different species of plants trees shrubs make you feel you have seen everything nature has to offer, well not quite, but enough to keep you busy for a good few hours. Must visit if you like nature!"
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,Make sure you see this and try very hard to get there at sunset. We were on the overhead bridge when the free light spectacular was one and were absolutely blown. A truly magical and wonderful experience
,,Wow,5.0,,"This place is like a jungle without the wild animals :) The vegetation and flora is just amazing. You go up 7 floors and then you come down. The waterfall was excellent.
There is the steaming hours but we were'nt in there so I am wondering as to how it feels.
Very relaxing place to go."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is an amazing part of Gardens by the Bay. It is especially nice if you plan to visit in the early tonmid afternoon since it's covered and air conditioned. There are many types of flowers and other things to see but I enjoyed the -5 degrees video on climate change. If you go to the Cloud Forest, I recommend taking the time to watch this."
,,spectacular,5.0,,The way it was set out with all the different areas and the waterfalls was so so well planned the only down side of it all was it was so cold inside but otherwise breathtaking
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,"Need more than an hour to see all features. MRT is good option to get here, forms part of gardens by the bay"
,,Nice Place,4.0,,"A good walk, though if you have limited time to spend here, skip this and go for Flower Dome instead."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Fantastic views, well worth a visit. We went and cooled down by the spray of the waterfall and then straight to the top and worked our way down. Would recommend and visit again!"
,,spectacular,5.0,,A pleasant walk amongst the flowers in a surprising cool environment. As a avid photographer I thoroughly enjoyed excursion with many photos ops. Prepare to be amazed
,,Man made beauty!,5.0,,If i hadn't visited this i would have never known that a man made structure could be such a beauty! The walk itself was out of the world experience. The flowers and the waterfall is magnificent.
,,Well worth the small cost,5.0,,"Recently visited the ""Cloud Forest"" after a cruise from Sydney. Had visited the ""Gardens by the Bay"" area previously. However, the Cloud Forest was something else altogether. I'm not necessarily a flora enthusiast, but this was a very good way to spend a few hours. The variation in plant types and colours were amazing. Not to mention the added bonus of escaping Singapore's warmth and humidity as the whole 7 floors of this attraction are temperature controlled. Don't miss the lego flora display on your way around. A great attraction. $14sgd at the attraction."
,,A worthwhile visit,3.0,,"We really enjoyed the cloud forest not only as a most welcome respite from the Singapore heat. The rib structure is as attractive on the inside as it is on the out. You travel up in an elevator to the seventh floor and then wend your way down past stunning flowers, exhibitions and waterfalls. A lovely place to visit."
,,Absolutely amazing. A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"This was unbelievable. A rain forest in a huge dome complete with waterfalls, trees and winding path. The engineering must have been extraordinary. It is cold and a bit damp inside the dome. There are lifts but you can walk around right up to the top from there you can see the city across the water...lovely."
,,different and interesting,4.0,,Was nice to look at and the views from up high are lovely. The greenery is amazing and people of all ages can visit as they cater for the aged or injured with special elevators. Some informative features re: the earth too
,,Better than expected,5.0,,Try to get there when they turn on the Cloud effect. Check out the timing at the entrance. Start at the top and work Your way diwn
,,Fresh rainforest experience without the humdity,5.0,,Great to walk around and see a large variety of rainforest plants and trees. There is also an informative video about global warming which is very interesting....
,,Simply overwhelmed,5.0,,Even after watching the construction of this project on TV we were not prepared for the scale of this structure. A 100 ft (?) waterfall in an extraordinary air-conditioned structure! How are the plants so green and always in bloom? In spite of its imposing height the place is friendly to seniors.
,,Worth every cent,5.0,,"Probably the best thing about my trip to Singapore. Just amazing, you walk into the dome to be greeted by a waterfall and lovely cool air conditioning. There are pathways 2-5 stories above ground level, offering amazing views. Had the best carnivorous plant displays I've ever seen."
,,Amazing Place,4.0,,I liked the place very much. One of the best place to visit in Singapore. A place where you can take a lot of beautiful photographs.
,,"An indoor mountain, only in Singapore...",4.0,,"I bought tickets for the 2 domes ($20 if you have employment pass, $28 regular price). But the cloud domes was definitely the better one! And actually the only one worth spending money on.
The indoor mountain experience was very cool just because I haven't seen anything like that before. Especially the first thing you see when you come in, impressive. The mountain is beautifully 'decorated' with all kinds of plants and flowers. You take the elevator to the top and on each level you can experience something new, do a treetop walk, ... The lower 2 levels focus on the environment, the impact humans have on it and the future. I thought it was beautifully presented and really gives you a wake up call. Although some might think ""here we go again"", the fact that they dedicate time and space to the message and force people to walk pass by it, is already an achievement.

On the other hand, at the end it is just an indoor mountain, meaning that it is slightly overpriced.

Tip: At the time I visited the cloud forest, there were no clouds but at the entrance there is a sign (which I missed obviously) with the timings they will create these cloud mists. Don't know how that will work but why not give it a shot :)
Tip: take a sweater, scarf or something warmer then +30C clothing. I found it cold inside!"

,,"amazing, worth the money",5.0,,Buy a ticket for both domes ($28) as they are very different and both worth seeing. The flower dome is full of the most colorful variety of flowers and the Cloud dome is amazing with tall columns covered with all kinds of plants.
,,Amazing,5.0,,An amazing achievement of technology and nature put together in a tropical atmosphere. We went at night and it was quite eerie and yet beautiful. Walking through the cloud forest reminded me of the movie Avatar and half expected some creature to jump out from behind some of the lush greenery. A great way to spend an hour or so.
,,Walk among the clouds with exotic plants - loved it,5.0,,"Buy the three attraction pass at the Gardens by the Sea in Singapore and take a walk among the treetops - 7 stories up among the clouds on a huge walkway. You take the elevator to the top and then walk down through a series of walkways and escalators.
The two domes have won many architectural awards and are interesting, not only from the viewpoint of the flora you can explore, but also the construction of the building which houses them.
I would highly recommend visiting them.
Note that there are two different admission rates - one for Singaporean residents and a different one for tourists."
,,"To me, this is part of the Gardens",5.0,,"Not sure why this is listed separately as, to me, it is part of the Gardens by the Bay and included in the same ticket. Very enjoyable and a lovely break from the heat outdoors."
,,Beautiful but not worth the money,3.0,,In Singapore there are very little free things to do and the places that you do pay for does not constitute value for money that you get in other countries. Cloud forest is worth a visit but not the fee
,,Cloud Forest! WOW,5.0,,"this was such a beautiful attraction to spend our final day in Singapore. The inside and outside of the dome is an architectual and environmental wonder. The dome looks stunning from the exterior but pails to what you see inside. The stunning and massive waterfall you see upon entry is lovely. The cooled interior was such a nice contrast to the hot Singapore outside. So many beautiful flowers to see and smell.

Take your time on the walk from the entry right to the top.

Also I really loved the earth centre part near the end. This shows things such as how the arctic ice has shrunk over past 30 years and also has a very confronting movie that runs for about 10 minutes about what will happen to our planet by the year 2100 if global warming continues!

Definitely would recommend this as a must do in Singapore! Take lots of photos"
,,Misty mountains high,5.0,,Man made mountain .. amazing assortment of plants and descriptions. Very Beautiful and peaceful and well implemented. Educationally interesting. Amazing photographic opportunities.
,,amazing!,5.0,,"Take a jacket.
The cloud forest was stunning, never seen anything like it before. We went in the evening, so it was dark outside, giving a mysterious air to the whole experience. it was beautiful, the wind and the sounds and the everything! loved every second and will definitely return"
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"It was educational, would be good for a school trip to learn about the eco-friendly environment. Well-decorated and designed."
,,Super!,5.0,,Singapore is a wonderfull. Espesially Sentoza is a must to see place with its beach and entertaintment programmes. We have been here with 4 friends and had nonforgetable time.
,,Wonderful experience!,5.0,,A small extra charge gives you an excellent view and new perspective on the great attraction. Lifts up and down mean you don't get overly tired or hot. Good photo opportunities.
,,SUPERB!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a must see. Unbelievable!
It is climate controlled so it was a pleasant way to spend a few hours. We would have liked to have had more time in the gardens.
Don't miss the free light show at 7.30 pm and 8.30 pm each night.
We also took the audio trip on the tram. This took us around all the outside gardens. If you are short on time this is the way to go. Cost about 8 Singapore dollars."
,,Wow !,5.0,,"Even you have seen tropical/rain forest jungles, i think its still a new and amazing experience... Lovely and memorable and ticket price is reasonable... P.S: its very cold in there, take a warm cloth with you"
,,A cool oasis,4.0,,"If you love nature, but hate the heat the Cloud Forest is by far the best thing you will experience in Singapore. In short the Cloud Forest is a well designed mini forest/oversized garden enclosed in a giant dome and sprinkled with cloudy mist."
,,A must see attraction in Singapore,5.0,,I went to Cloud forest and flower dome and was amazed by their otherworldly beauty! I like how they kept the temperature and humidity at a comfortable level - quite refreshing compared to hot weather outside.
,,Unexpected fun,5.0,,Must visit when at The Gardens. Make a special trip if necessary. Don't want to describe it too much as the fun will be ruined. It was especially enjoyable as we had no idea it was such an interesting place.
,,"If ur not a plant/flower lover, giv it a miss!",3.0,,"Frankly, I not a plant or flower enthusiast so I wud b giving a very bias review..
First of all, the place is like an igloo wen u enter, so I Cudnt wait to leave..
There were plants, plants n more plants..
We jus walked one round n left the place..
The tickets too were quite expensive too.."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,A superb place! Upon entering this place is breath taking. Well worth a visit! Great value for money.
,,What a thought,5.0,,What a thought on sustainable energy !! You should not miss the video they show at the ground level - that will give you complete understanding of the idea behind creating this.
,,It's fun to walk in the clouds!,5.0,,We enjoyed the surprise on this walk. There are unexpected turns and vantage points that keep ones interest peaked.
,,Beautiful !,4.0,,The waterfall is gorgeous ! Nice Idea ! Impressive ! It's full of artificially created natural beauty.
,,Fantastic!!,5.0,,My son loved this! Big waterfall and lots of cool foliage to get lost in. It was a great couple of hours and we liked it so much we visited twice. Some really beautiful flowers and plants and we very much enjoyed the film at the end. Gave my son tremendous food for thought about renewable energy and the environment. A great afternoon!
,,Freezing COLD,5.0,,"we loved the Cloud Forest. But it was freezing cold inside, I think they should reduce the temperature a bit less. I liked the variety of trees and flowers and it was a nice experience with family to visit"
,,The waterfall is amazing !,4.0,,"The waterfall is what you'll remember most, and I don't know why it is so damn cold standing near it. The concept is very green and it's very comfortable to walk around. When you visit at night the waterfall will have the light turn on"
,,wow,5.0,,the waterfall and the rain forests are a treat to watch... for ppl with fear of heights the way down can be a bit troublesome.... but must see....
,,Amazing place. Simply a MUST.,5.0,,"It is like being in a sci-fi movie, I've never felt like this before. Do visit the Garden by the Bay and check this pavilion, you will not regret."
,,A mini escape,4.0,,Filled with interesting plants and flowers. It was cool inside providing a nice escape from the heat outside. Interesting walkways gave views out to the highlights of Singapore - Marina Bay Sands etc. Worth the price of admission.
,,Looked from the outside,3.0,,We went down to check out the Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest was there. We didnt realise you had to pay for the gardens separately so we looked in from the outside.
,,"Refreshing, rejuvenating, a must visit",5.0,,"First things first:
Do not get confused between cloud forest and OCBC sky walk as both are located at the same site, Gardens by the Bay. Garden by the Way has two conservatories, Cloud Forest has two domes, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
If you are a Singapore citizen then you can buy individual tickets for either of these conservatories, if you are a visitor then you get combined ticket only.
Cloud Forest is a conservatory where rain forest plants are displayed. As soon as you enter the dome, you are greeted by a lush waterfall, which takes away all your tiredness from the day. I recommend that you visit this dome at the latter phase of the day so that you get maximum relaxation.
To reach cloud forest, you can get down at Promenade MRT station and follow the directions to Gardens by the Bay. You can also reach via Helix bridge from Marina Bay Sands area.
The dome has many rainforest plants, interesting waterways and waterfalls. There is a skyway to transfer to upper levels, and these skyways are shrouded with artificial mist and foam. Walking from the uppermost level to the lowest over the skywalk provided much needed rejuvenation to a visitor.
There is a crystal garden also in one of the floor where crystals from various stages are on display.
You will need 1-2 hours to complete the visit of this dome. There is a gift shop on exit, which provided many curious and interesting articles.
There is no eatery inside the dome, outside has few options."
,,Amazing garden and structure for the young and older travellers.,5.0,,"Worth the entry fee, plants combined with some fantastic sculptures. A nice break from the humidity these houses were surprisingly cool inside with an abundance of plants to look at we were there for Tulipmania which was a nice suprise."
,,Great concept,5.0,,"An waterfall inside a giant glass dome, accompanied with an array of interesting plants and flowers - well worth a visit."
,,Interesting cool & gorgeous,5.0,,"This is a 35 metre high 'mountain' complete with waterfall & planted with lots of orchids & ferns.Very cool on a hot day & a great place to have an over view of the light show of the Supertrees, but go well before dark to fully appreciate the displays. There is a lift to the top if you don't feel like walking"
,,What an experience,5.0,,"Wherever you go in Singapore,they seem to have everything well done but in this case it's exceptionally well done, you must visit this attraction."
,,Magic greeneries,5.0,,"This is the twin sphere of the Flower Dome. You will find a great variety of rain vegetation walking on the top ofmthis unbelieveble human made tree. This new area of Singapore, the Marine Bay, easy to reach via subway is worth a long visit."
,,Never miss this extraordinary this place,5.0,,"For nature and protection of the environment THE PLACE TO VISIT ABSOLUTELY in SINGAPORE. Congratulation to the architects and creators of the Gardens by the Bay gorgeous place, there is no other like that in the world. The Cloud Forest is a must , it brings you in direct connexion to the nature and vegetation of the cloud forst with many explanations . Its a discovery and a pleasure to visit this place . Bring your children and let them discover this place."
,,Unbelievable!,5.0,,"Add this to your itinerary! You won't see anything like it anywhere else. Every thought has been given to creating the eco-friendly botanical sanctuary. Whether you love plants or just think they are useful, you will be absolutely amazing by this and the neighbouring Flower Dome."
,,High up along the walkway,5.0,,"We enjoyed cloud forest while waiting for the light show at gardens by the bay. The waterfall as you come in .the beautiful plants, and the views were great."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,My 8 year old said it was the best place on Earth! We loved the whole experience. Worth it! Can recommend it highly!
,,A way to stay cool...,5.0,,"Visit the bio domes on Marina Bay and stay cool during the heat of the day. These are amazing. For Brits think Eden project but more ambitious in concept. Lots of lovely set piece displays, a very tool waterfall. Really enjoyed our visit. Go."
,,More environmental education recommended,3.0,,"Interesting but very busy and not enough environmental/botanical information/education which is what these types of attractions should provide,"
,,a must,5.0,,its lovely and cool. beautiful plants and views. its all part of the gardens by the bay and stunning. not to be missed. Prices are reasonable.
,,Wow!,4.0,,"The dome itself is amazing - a huge waterfall with well maintained gardens and exhibits. The only complaint - that you have to purchase tickets for both domes on the one day, otherwise it is more expensive to buy separately. We visited early evening to miss the heat of the day."
,,One of coolest planet on Planet Insanity,5.0,,I hesitated cos I did not want to spend the $25 but was so glad I went in the end. I felt like I was in the future - but a happy one. It gave me hope for the world seeing such beautiful nature in such a big city. The atmosphere was magical. Well worth every cent!
,,The only waterfall in Singapore(?),4.0,,"What amazed me is there was a 6-story waterfall that looked natural. It was cold just like in Puncak in West Java and Brastagi in North Sumatra. There was a lift and stair if we would like to ""go-into"" the waterfall. Attractive!"
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,We had a great visit here and would thoroughly recommend it. A great place to go on a hot day. You walk in to a huge Eden Project type dome to be faced by a waterfall and the path takes you through all types of plant species. Imaginatively laid out and very interesting. Allow about an hour to an hour and a half.
,,Simply Amazing!,5.0,,"Like: Everything! The design, the amazing collection of plants and flowers. If feels like you are in a tropical jungle but in a sub-tropical temperature and humidity, very comfy! Dislike: nothing!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This was such an amazing place to visit. I was overwhelmed by the majesty of the cloud forest inside the dome, with the misty spray rising from the walkways. It was amazing to think that this is happening every day around the world's cloud forests, and here is a little recreated piece of it. I spent hours here going round again and again until it closed!"
,,Spectacular Concept,5.0,,Wonderful experience at the Gardens. Certainly a place to spend the entire day. plants already looking good even though it is only a few years old. Certainly a must for anyone visiting Singapore
,,Rather spectacular,5.0,,"Some wonderful information on the various levels, but generally was just beautiful to wander amongst an indoor forest and see the amazing waterfall. Our 2 very young granchildren just kept saying ""Oh wow"""
,,Excellent Park in the Middle of the City,5.0,,"A very pretty park, with the large glass walls, the huge waterfalls, the Lost World and other attractions within the park. Explore this when in Singapore - a must-visit as well."
,,cool and very well set up,5.0,,"Although still fairly recent so not every plant has grown into its fullness, this place is a fresh oasis in a hot city. The steep entrance-fee is worth it. Beautiful architecture, great plants and, of course, it's Singapore (!),organised till the last detail."
,,An out of the world experience!,5.0,,An out of the world experience. Brilliant conceptualization. A must visit if you are in Singapore. Will require a little bit of walking around inside but definitely worth the effort.
,,In The Clouds,5.0,,"It was amazing! I have never seen so many beautiful flowers in one place. It is a photographers dream. The waterfalls were flowing to the pond below, with windows behind them to take photographs through. It was definately worth the trip."
,,What a place!,5.0,,"This was such a great place to visit and it was nice and cool, too - always a bonus in Singapore! Fascinating and awe inspiring - we loved it!"
,,Truly Astonishing,5.0,,"Driving in from the airport, this building and its sister building stand out. Their architecture is amazing. I couldn't wait to see it. It was the first thing that we did in Singapore. It is a lovely walk down from the top with the overlooks and waterfall. It is a ""don't miss"" for Singapore."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay complex, the Cloud Forest has to be the coolest corner of Singapore! Fully accessible and of interest to all ages, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would return without hesitation. Good value, too."
,,Indoor waterfall to die for!,5.0,,This dome allows you to 'go up in the clouds' and walk all the way down.....a different experience on each level. Watch out for the water spray though!
,,Misty with a waterfall,5.0,,"Indoors, cool and moist, we walked down and through,viewing mountain plants. I particularly liked the bromiliads, I collect them, they were extensive, varied, and beautiful. I recommend spending some time in and aroung the Marina Bay area."
,,Another do not miss Singapore experience.,5.0,,"Walk through a cloud forget with lots of plants, flowers, waterfalls...all contained in an unusual climate controlled environment, despite the heat and humidity of Singapore."
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,"We arrived late at the cloud forest too late to buy tickets but we where still able to wander around and take in the venue, it is truly amazing, we will go back if we go back to Singapore"
,,Oasis in the middle of the city,4.0,,"If you need a break from the Singapore heat, Gardens by the bay/Cloud Forest is a great escape. Similar to the Eden Project in the UK, the project is made up of two domes - one the Cloud forest where you can walk through a man-made forest at numerous different levels, and one the Flower dome, featuring every type of flower imaginable.

Try to see the Cloud Forest during the regular misting which really makes it cloudy!"
,,amazing indoor waterfall,4.0,,"natural garden with highest waterfall indoor, it's a place you shouldn't miss. It's easier to be on top of the waterfall, than natural waterfall."
,,Take a jacket with you,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a forest on a mountain in a glass construction. The temperature is around 20 degrees (Celcius), so if you're used to the Singaporean temperatures, you should bring a jacket or something.
In the cloud forest, they'd made a Mediterranean climate. You can walk all around (and up) the mountain. There are a lot of different plant species with sometimes beautiful flowers. Sometimes, there is even a cloud in the building, which is why it even more resembles a real Mediterranean forest."
,,Surprise Eco attraction,4.0,,Skeptical of this towering man made dome and artificial waterfall I was completing won over by the end. The walk through the eh mist with many orchids and plants clinging to the frame did not prepare me for the end when the whole project was revealed as being carbon neutral . I got even better as there is a slide show at the end on an enormous screen talking about climate change and how we need to keep the world at .5 degrees. The room was full of families and kids and I was so happy to see the Singporeans thing this issue seriously. Well done!
,,Best place to be on a hot SG day.,5.0,,"Not only is it a great walk, the views from the top are awesome too and there's many a great picture able to be shot."
,,• Flower Dome +Cloud Forest,2.0,,"Not sure how the locals can rave about these 2 attractions… but then again when there are no natural landmarks in this city, anything remotely interesting in flora and fauna, even if it’s artificial and man-made, is an attraction in Singapore. We are so blessed in Australia to have real waterfalls and exotic plants. Would we recommend this to any seasoned traveler-lover of nature? – no"
,,A special treat,5.0,,"I have now been twice to the Cloud Forest, taking my adult daughter the second time. Perhaps not quite as good as the domes in England, it is very well done with a real feel of rain forest, spectacularly set up, and super surrounding views"
,,Beautful,5.0,,"While in Singapore, the Cloud Forest is a must try. We selected this location from a list of available attraction via City Tours. The inside of the glass dome is climate controlled, so if you get cold easily you may want to bring a light sweater. There are many amazing species of plant life here to view as well as beautiful waterfalls. Would travel here again for sure."
,,Stunning cloud dome,5.0,,"The domes themselves are fantastic and a stunning example of modern architecture. When you walk into the cloud dome. WOW, you face the worlds tallest in door waterfall - stunning! Then you walk through a array of plants from rainforests. Time it right to experience the misting, but expect to feel damp.
The walk inside in impressive dome allows you enjoy the plants from a variety of perspectives. There is a wide variety of plants, we enjoyed the domes and would highly recommend them."
,,An engineering feat.,5.0,,"A man made mountain, inside a glass dome, complete with waterfall. Only in Singapore, but so worth the effort. A chance to see some very rare plants."
,,fancy way to be in a jungle for fancy people,4.0,,"What to expect when you come to a man made jungle inside a huge glass dome:
1. It is a convenient jungle with the air conditioned, no smell from the animal pee or poo.
2. Very well selected trees for the best of our eyes can memorized (although it was failed).
3. Good experiences and no worries.

Good for kids learning."
,,Take a break on a mountain at sea level,4.0,,"Cool on a hot/humid day, excellent photo ops for orchids and other flowers & plants. The whole climate control system is fairly interesting. I had limited time but the displays for +5degrees and other exhibits looked interesting."
,,Forest in the city,4.0,,"Be pleasantly surprised as you'll be greeted by a water falls when you enter the cloud forest! Be prepared to go up on heights and walk along narrow steel walkways suspended in the air. For those afraid of heights, no worries, there's a lot to see aroun w/o going to the top"
,,A little dissapointing,4.0,,"After the initial ""WOW"" on entrance it was just a lot of green..... Was cold so take a jacket if you feel the cold. Worth a visit?, yes, as another example of Singapores forward thinking."
,,Love you Singapore!,5.0,,"I just absolutely love the creativity of Singaporeans for this. An awesome place which also teaches you about the nature. Loved the multileveled complex with the waterfall and the trees. Amazing walking platforms which starts from the top of the structure is lovely. So many great photo ops and the chance to spend some time in a lovely cool jungle-like environment is fun for all ages.
There is a different fee for international visitors but can be combined into a cheaper ticket if you want to visit both the Cloud forest and the flower dome."
,,"Fascinating experience, a must see attraction!",5.0,,"The falls entrance is a nice surprise but it leads to so much more. You will find the way up a relaxing activity. The beautiful vibrant colors of the flowers are enticing. The conservatory feels like a natural rain forrest climate, a welcome relief from the usual humidity in Singapore."
,,cool off from the heat,4.0,,"nice experience on a hot day to step inside a cool atmosphere, lovely to walk up the cloud... and great selection of flowers, loved all the fuchias, reminded me of home!"
,,Well worth a visit to the Cloud Forest,5.0,,absolutely beautiful - to see flowers and trees in a rainforest type of environment was great. Being able to walk at different levels was really lovely.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Superb ... an exciting, visually stimulating and generally stunning experience. Walking through wonderful plants in a great setting - and a bit of excitement from the suspended walkway. Don't miss it!"
,,Fun time with family,5.0,,Wonderful creative place for all. Relaxing and fun place for all ages. A wonderful addition to the rest of the park.
,,water fall with garden ...,5.0,,we have visited in feb.cool atmosphere with nice plants and water fall artificially created.must visit place in singapore
,,Nice waterfall,4.0,,"There are fees for these huge cool ""greenhouses"" but the experience is worth it. A must try in Singapore. Location is very convenient, right across the sky bridge from marina bay sands casino. The top is so high that it's unreal looking down"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Loved the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. We stayed at Marina Bay & was just a short walk away. Loving nature & photography, we were tossing up whether to go to the botanical gardens but after visiting these 2 places in air conditioning, we gave the botanical gardens a miss. Preferred the flower dome, but the cloud forest was impressive and very pretty, especially the garden up the top."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Another great attraction in Singapore. The cloud forest is awesome from towering thunderous waterfalls, to walls covered in orchids, ferns, bromeliads, carnivorous plants and even some plants made out of lego which were well done. Take the lift up and explore your way down via the walkway in the clouds. We loved the cloud forest dome and it was a welcome respite from the heat."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"Loved everything and my 9 year old was excited beyond words. Loved the +5 degrees video at the end that delivered an effective climate change message that will be remembered for a very long time.
Wonderful experience and quite an affordable way to pass an afternoon in Singapore"
,,AMAZING!!!!! DO BOTH DOMES!!!!!,5.0,,"We purchased the combo ticket to do both domes. Both were amazing.

Tip - watch your step as you enter cloud forrest, as the ground is wet from the spray of the huge waterfall and my sister slipped on it lol.

You start by walking around the base of the massive plant covered mountain, straight past the huge waterfall. Then you head up an elevator and then down via a series of suspended walkways.

Inside the mountain are interesting things to look at as well.

It really is amazing that such a huge thing can be sitting inside a building!

Full credit to Singapore for putting so much effort into all the beautiful greenery like this, that appears all around your amazing city!!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Just lovely, really well made. A must do if you visit Singapore. Bring your camera. Nice enviromental focus also."
,,What a gem,5.0,,"We saw this on our last day in Singapore, it was the highlight of our trip. To be able to walk around for such a long time out of the oppressive heat and enjoy the rainforest was just an absolute joy.

I've never seen so many different flowers and orchids in one place.
If you love green spaces then this attraction should really be on your list of things to see in Singapore."
,,amazing !!!,5.0,,"i loved it.. its not an artificial forest , its something beyond that. must watch n Singapore...spending 28 $ ( cloud forest + flower dome) is worth.."
,,Wow - better than we'd expected,5.0,,"We were quite blown away by the Cloud Forest. You enter at the base of a large waterfall that cascades down an artificial ""mountain"". Paths then take you up through the ""mountain"" past an assortment of tropical and sub-tropical plants. If you love orchids, you'll love this attraction. The Cloud Forest is a pretty easy walk from the MRT station (on a hot day make sure you have a hat and fluids). There are shuttle buses, but the lines were long so we enjoyed our walk through the gardens."
,,Enchanting,5.0,,Beautifully presented attraction. A highlight of a visit to Singapore. The misting created a wonderful ambiance.
,,gardens by the bay,5.0,,"The two conservatories at Gardens by the Bay were fantastic, especially the Cloud Forest. There is a long pathway that starts at the top and you slowly walk down and around. Very very interesting"
,,Nicely prepared indoor waterfall,5.0,,"I can highly recommend ""Cloud Forest"". As one of two ""cooled conservatories"" in Gardens by the Bay, this one is very much more interesting than its twin. You will be able to buy tickets for single admission at roughly 60% of the price. Cloud Forest is a multi-tiered indoor structure (slightly cold - might be a good idea to bring some kind of jacket), showing botanic live relating to various elevations along mountains. Interesting from a ""museum"" perspective as well as just as ""entertainment"". Expect a visit to take roughly 45 min - 1 hr."
,,Prepare to be amazed,5.0,,"The whole experience is one not to be missed, from the canopy walk, tumbling waterfalls and the feeling of being in a tropical rainforest. 'Misting' takes place at certain times of the day and it really does add to the atmosphere,"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Very serene, and beautiful. Very unexpected when you walk in - has an unusual path to it that adds to the excitement. lots to see and enjoy!"
,,from another planet,5.0,,Verry impressive feature. We were shocked and amazed by this attraction. It looks like taken out from some SiFi movie.
,,Fantastic! Surprisingly cool! Must See!,5.0,,Unique experience and did up to the expectation of our group! We had a great day walking up to different levels of the skywalks.
,,Wow just wow,5.0,,"The creation of the waterfall and the gardens in an around it is just amazing. The gantry walks give amazing views and the displays in and around it are really informative. If you like waterfalls and gardens, check this place out"
,,Awesome,4.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The display of plants and flowers just lovely. The waterfall very realistic and a tropical feel of the whole pavilion. I really enjoyed myself. Elevators and walkways easy to manage.
,,A walk in the clouds,5.0,,"Interesting architecture, jungle-like feel combined with good sound effects makes it worth spending half an hour in a very moist and cold glass building. The best part is the sky-walk, but i wouldn't recommend it to people with fear of heights, especially during the day. At night the lights are very dim and you cant really see how high the walk paths are."
,,Feels like in Clouds,5.0,,One of the Best thing to do in Gardens by the Bay.Its one of the wonderful thing a man can recreate! Don't miss the mist show at 12 pm (for repeat times pl.check on net) It has theme forests of various continents.and it has succeeded doing it.The waterfall is mind blowing and when mist show starts the whole giant dome turns into Equitorial Rain forest. It's best place photography enthusiast to try to capture nature in controlled surroundings.
,,Don't Miss It,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is inside the Gardens by the Bay. If you like flowers & plants, don't miss it. You may choose just visit the Gardens by the Bay free but Cloud Forest is highly recommended though a fee is required. Take MRT to Bayfront Station or take a taxi at your option.

1) It's air-conditioned - after touring at the open areas at the Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest is a perfect place to cool you down.
2) There are many special flowers & plants, waterfall inside. If you like flowers & plants or photo shooting, it will take you not less than 3-4 hours.
3) There are different floor levels with different themes for visiting.
4) The sky walk is amazing though scary for some people."
,,Great place to visit if you love plants,3.0,,"They have hundreds of varieties of plants in a climate controlled room, with great architectural landscape as well. Not really a must see in Singapore but if you have time to spare, it's one of a good spots to visit."
,,Perfect place also/or especially with teenagers,5.0,,"Even when you are only a few days in Singapore cloud forest (resp. both glasshouses) are worth the visit.
Is easy to access either from Marina Bay Sands or walking from city center (we stayed at Swissotel Stamford and the walk took us 20 min)
We have two boys 16 and 17 and both were at the begging bored (again smth where we MUST join parents) but when we entered the glasshouses they find this “attraction” so interesting than we spent there more than 2 and half hour – by far more than originally planned. For details check the website but when you purchase ticket don’t forget to buy audio commentary device. Is 4 or five SGN $ we forgot to buy and once inside it was not so easy to get one. Anyway when visiting this “attraction” you will discover thinks you didn’t know about – crisp and clear introduction what is about cloud forest – IS NOT same as rain forest, what I know now 
One think what we a bit underestimate was than in both glasshouses was quite a cold climate so after the hours spent there we feel right cold."
,,Luscious and relaxing air-conditioned stroll,4.0,,"A large complex that can, at a leisurely stroll through take an hour or so. Longer if you wish to explore all the different plants and sights ... shorter if you stroll through quickly.

An air-conditioned eco-system and a relief from the humidity. A mist of moisture as you enter near the bottom of the largest indoor waterfall. Stroll up the path and up an elevator to the top and it's a treetop walk down ... exploring different levels with environmental or nature friendly themes.

Quite enjoyed the relaxing experience of it!

Tips: Make sure you also get a ticket to the adjacent flower dome!"
,,breathtaking,5.0,,"The most breathtaking man-made forest I have seen. Perfect for a date. the waterfall was spectacular! it helped that the dome was air-conditioned, too!"
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,The Cloud Forest is part of the Gardens By the Bay and it is worth a visit. There are beautiful tropical plants and interesting architectural designs. If for nothing else it is air conditioned - which you will definitely appreciate.
,,"""Giant Chia Pet under a glass dome w/ the craziest skywalks you have ever been on?""",5.0,,"What's not to like?
Went here on a hunch, un-resarched not even googled, lured by an image alone - grabbed a cab (and declined to see the other flower dome - ""nah - just that green, hairy thing..."") - It's WILD! It has been a long time since architecture made me yelp, quiver and sweat (even though it's quite cool in there) you see: the walkways sway!! (fat guy walks by = you feel it for a minute) the skywalks also have transparent gratings at the edges (DANG!) and this thing juts out in space 6-7 floors above grade, just like it suitably SHOULD!! It's like a young design students uninhibited wild and crazy idea but IT IS BUILT, and it is DONE WELL - (really well) - the exhibits are good, if not excellent, the technology refined and the whole enterprise represents another exclamation mark for the leadership that S'pore takes on in design, ideas and public structures.
I did something that day that we should ALL do: ""Do something that makes you uncomfortable"" - I am ""so-so"" with heights apparently and this pushed me REALLY ""out there"" and I experienced thrills, chills and delights through someone's idea and built design - certainly worthy an enterprise"
,,5 degrees waterfall. Awesome.,5.0,,"The skywalk was really scary. Its high. We went there at night, so it was really quiet, as there is not many people around. The place close at 930pm so you might want to go there early to enjoy the gardens. The manmade waterfall was great, you can feel the breeze and water splash when your standing near. Great experience overall.

Oh yeah, after your visit to the garden, should definitely enjoy your meal at the Satay by the bay which is about 5 more minutes walk from the garden dome. There is also a taxi stand there, and a taxi phone number available. Very convinient especially after heavy meal. Im guessing the satay by the bay are only open at late afternoon, so perfect for dinner."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This was like walking into another world....it was refreshing and just beautiful. Words cant describe this, perhaps like a rainforest!"
,,Like Science Fiction,5.0,,"Entering this artificial, enclosed environment invokes memories of science fiction. Think space colonies and biospheres! It also provides welcome relief from the climate outside! This fusion of engineering and nature also looks interesting as an art project. There are stalactites and crystals on display as...More"
,,Spectacular Gardens,5.0,,Breathtaking vertical gardens. If you have vertigo the bridges are a challenge but you don't have to go on them.
,,So So,4.0,,"In a big dome, colorful water falls from 6th story. The place is cooled by strong air-conditioning and throwing out mist and making it look like clouds. Go by elevator to 6th floor, walk up by stairs one more floor and see almost 360 degree...More"
,,Evening delight,5.0,,What a surprise to see the waterfall as soon as I walked in. Lovely in the early evening to see it all lit up. This whole dome is delightful and so easy to walk through even though a lot of people were in it.
,,Don't miss thithe Cloud Fores in the Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,"Initially, we just wanted to go walk around the Gardens by the Bay. A couple of other people we met strongly encouraged us to make sure we went into the Cloud Forest. Wow! we were really glad we spent the time inside. It is quite...More"
,,Amazing Waterfall,5.0,,We visited this early evening when it was all lit up in Purple colours... Was STUNNING ! Have to make it a to do thing while in Singapore !
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,Visiting this place on a humid afternoon is a blessing. It is a multi-storey artificial mountain built with a rain forest theme. go to the top floor first and then come down visiting each floor. Each floor has a different theme and design. On one...More
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"If time is limited, choose this rather than flower dome or both domes. Lots of vegetation to see and the walks created are interesting and refreshing to do- especially away from the outdoor heat."
,,Cool break on a hot day,3.0,,Felt it was overpriced for what you got. The misting only went for 5 minutes and wasn't as spectacular as expected
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"We didn't know what to expect, only that this attraction had a high trip advisor ranking...with good reason! It was like being in the rainforest, in the middle of a metropolitan city, and without all the large rainforest bugs. Very beautiful, peaceful, and educational. worth...More"
,,So creative,5.0,,You must go to see the gardens by the bay including the cloud forest. Excellent facilities. Take a hat or fan or umbrella for the walk to the cloud forest. No shade.
,,Will get even better.,4.0,,"This part of Gardens by the Bay is also new. We really liked it but can see that as the plants grow and mature it will be even better, hence 4/5.
The artificial climate was a treat on a tropical sultry day, the plants both beautiful and fascinating."
,,Must see!,5.0,,Liked everything about it! The spray mist that comes on every couple of hours or is fantastic in the heat of Singapore!
,,Well done,4.0,,"A lot to view, lots of vegetation from many places on earth. Some may find it not worth while, but there should be something for everyone."
,,A Must visit new attraction in the lil country!,4.0,,I liked the green space created indoors! - It is a nice space to spend a day - try and reach early (before 4 pm) - its worth spending time -about half a day.
,,"Live it, it i.e. real",5.0,,"A place you must visit, you will feel the Amazon and touch it with you hands. A great and well created copy of the Amazon with all its details (except here it is safer to live the experience ;-) )"
,,All sunny,4.0,,We don't usually 'go' for 'over-the-top' but when done as well as the cloud forest it's spectactular.The quality of the displays was outstanding - even liked the use of the transported stalactites and stalagmites and wooden weavings and sculptures...and of course the waterfalls and hanging gardens. The eco display was excellent - saw kids enthralled by it.
,,Interesting exhibit,4.0,,Well presented and good to feel the different temperatures the higher you went to the top. A good variety of flowers throughout and a refreshing waterfall.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"one of two indoor domes at gardens by the bay. The other dome is a nice, but pretty standard indoor botanic garden, with plants from different regions. Cloud Forest has a tropical rainforest, complete with a 6-7 story high waterfall. An elevated walkway takes you through the different ecosystems. Worth visiting both domes."
,,On Cloud Nine,5.0,,"This is one of Singapore's newest attractions. The variety of plants are astounding - seeing is believing !!! Wow, Singapore has not failed in its attempts to attract more visitors by opening out new sites, showcasing different varieties of plants from all over the world."
,,What a fantastic place.,5.0,,"As you enter this dome you are greeted with the biggest indoor waterfall you will ever see. They spray the entire indoor mountain every two hours so if your lucky you do get the feeling of walking amongst the clouds. Ii you purchase dual ticket S$28 you enter here and Flower dome. Gardens at the Bay are free, you ay to enter domes, use skywalk or trolley bus commentary."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Very good place for a family to walk. The garden was kinda like in rain forest, the temperature was cold, just like real rain forest."
,,Chritmas time decorations were awesome,5.0,,I visited in early December. And CloudForest was awesomely decorated with very nice music playing all over
,,A Must See,5.0,,"Even if you in Singapore for a stop over (allow 5 or hours) a MUST see in Singapore is Gardens By the Bay. Singapore spent $1 Billion (that's right) setting up over 770,000 plants from around the world in a brilliant setup and part of that attraction is Cloud Forest - in the enclosed dome is a fine mist that is everywhere. Great on a hot day. You will be blown away by what is on display"
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,"Well worth the visit, a great deal of thought has gone into the creation of this indoor garden. Great atmosphere and a real credit to the organisers. A real must see"
,,garden in the sky,5.0,,"Wow, one of the best things ever seen. Just the whole setup left ys speechless and in awe. A lot to take in."
,,Wonderful Biodome,5.0,,A very well designed tower of plants together with a built in waterfall. Go up in the lift and walk down a walkway to see all the variety of plants and exotics.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,I'm not a great gardener but found the design and plants wonderful. It took longer than we thought to see this amazing piece of landscaping
,,Cool place,4.0,,"I like the building, the water fall, the plants. All is really cool. What I dislike: it's a little bit cold inside due to the water mist"
,,An amazing indoor cloud forest,5.0,,"You are greeted by a multi-story waterfall falling from the brink of a vertical garden. After taking an elevator to the top, you walk in descending spirals down the gardens seeing a wealth of orchids, bromeliads and othe flora too numerous to mention. If you arrive at the right time, a cool mist fils the dome. A truly magical addition to Mr. LKY's vision of the Garden City"
,,Incredible views on the ground and above waterfall,4.0,,"Not the biggest fan of flowers, but the smell and the information received from the audio guide was well worth the visit. Not to mention the views from below the waterfall, the top of the waterfall, and even a couple levels in between, with tropical flowers EVERYWHERE!"
,,"arranged, big and colorfull",5.0,,"it is arranged well and clean but i have no idea what is that plant called, it would be great if there is a name plate and brief explanation of each"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Loved this exhibit, a definite must see when in Singapore. So much work has gone into the planning of this the amazing plants all growing so well, we just loved it."
,,Not to be missed.,5.0,,"Coming in from the heat, this is an oasis of wonderful, wonderful because it is so cool. Soon you will forget the temperature and see the most amazing waterfall, go round the corner and you are in another world, a world of wonderful. Yes, I am saying it again, because you will be a pumpkin if you don't find this the best experience indoors ever. The wet, misty atmosphere is ideal for all humans and plants. This ideas is thee most impressive thing I have seen in years. You will miss out if you miss the forest cloud."
,,Stunning Eco forest,5.0,,"Authentic replication of rain forest plants at ones fingertips. An oasis in the heart of the city of skyscrapers, clean and well maintained.
An example to other cities. A mix of locals and tourists present on the day we visited indicates appreciation is encompassing to both sectors."
,,The best place to visit on a hot day in Singapore,4.0,,"This is a truly unique experience. Natives grow as far as the eye can see on this 35 metre tall mountain with a plunging waterfall that has lovely cooling mist gently rising up to the glass dome surround. There are different displays on each level as you climb the tower, including a crystal forest. The collection of plants are spectacular. Well worth the entry price."
,,My favourite dome,5.0,,"This dome is located inside Gardens by the bay. When you enter the dome, there is a huge indoor waterfall. The dome is designed like mountain, with low terrain plants on the low level and high terrain plants located on the higher level."
,,Nice plants and a nice climb down,4.0,,"A nice break from the Singapore weather with lots of garden plants to see. You take an elevator to the top and work your way down. It is reasonably cool inside, but still a bit humid especially a the top."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Spectacular building very well worth visiting the gardens by the bay. A must for gardeners or plant enthusiasts. Can be very cold in the cloud building after the heat of singapore, take something like a jumper to wear."
,,A must see!!!,5.0,,The cloud forest is located on the edge of the gardens by the bay and is a must see for any visitor. It is basically a massive green house holding a rainforest scene inside as well as a very high waterfall. It doesn't sound much in words but you will definitely enjoy the sight.
,,very technolagical,5.0,,I really like & wondered ab't what they do really and because of their beautiful jungle and all thind
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"What a lovely setting. The plants are beautiful, and the walk was well worth the fee. If you have to choose between this and the flower conservatory - choose this one. Mind you they are both well worth a visit!"
,,Fascinating but wierd,4.0,,"Amazing architecture and a good collection based around a mountain waterfall theme. It's an incredible building and the impact is stunning but botanically it lacks the importance of other gardens such as the Eden project, but still well worth seeing - an it's air conditioned which for a greenhouse is quite a feat of engineering!"
,,Excellent experience,4.0,,"The Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome is part of the Garden by the Bay complex, which is a must see in Singapore. Both are cool inside and the contents if both are truly fantastic. It's also an easy walk to the Marina Bay Sands hotel too if you wish to go to the Skypark."
,,A Must See,5.0,,I loved visiting the Cloud Forest. When you first walk in from a hot day you are faced with a beautiful misty and cooling waterfall. The vertical garden walls are stunning. I have never seen a place like this before! A great walk throughout the dome which can seem a bit high for some people on the upper levels. Well worth a visit for something different.
,,Manmade Nature,4.0,,"Wonderful integration of waterfalls and gardens in a synthetic world. I imagine if we ever live in space or another planet, this type of park will be created. A great way to spend a few hours."
,,Exceptional!,5.0,,"We were staying at the Marina Bay Sands and could see the unusually shaped domes from our hotel floor on the upper levels. On a week day morning we ventured out to the Gardens by the Bay which is free to enter and were purposed to find the unusually shaped domes. We purchased the double ticket for the two domes one being the Flower Dome and the other the Cloud Forest. We felt both were exceptional but if I had to choose a favorite it would be the Cloud Forest. It is a very high dome which is unusually shaped. Inside there is lots to see and far to walk if you take the foot path over the various rain forest displays and exhibitions. The foot path can be somewhat disturbing for people who don't like heights or are concerned about the see-through type glass floors. For me it was an adventure and definitely enjoyed the cool climate on the hot day and everything Cloud Forest had to offer.

There are restrooms accessible as well as an elevator for people who may need wheelchair accessibility or perhaps would rather not do all the walking and take the elevators between the different levels. Overall an unique experience and in our opinion a must see when visiting the beautiful city of Singapore."
,,Go here,5.0,,"Just a really cool place, the walk was fun. Watch out for other tourist as some think I should wait to get inside while they take 20 mins to take pictures of the waterfall."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"A great range of plants and flowers here. It is a paradise for botany photographers. The dome's architecture and the walkway are impressive. But it's a pity that they took their stalagmites and stalactites out of natural caves, where they truly belong, and did not make some models instead."
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,An architectural delight. Do not miss this place if you happen to visit Singapore. Its a delight to see a rain-forest like setting in the middle of the city.
,,awesome,5.0,,"A must visit , an incredible feat of engineering , the plants are beautiful , great viewing from the walk way ."
,,Engineering feat in 24C,5.0,,Astonishing engineering feat - a mountain created by man in a giant air-conditioned dome. A lift to take you to the top and a gentle walk down enabling you to enjoy the astonishing plant life.
,,Do the Dome..........walking on clouds,5.0,,"As mentioned in my Garden by the Bay review, the absolute highlight for me at the gardens was the cloud dome. It truly has it all with the cascading waterfalls, the misty landscape, brilliant flora suspended walkways that go up and beyond, all in an air conditioned dome with views to the bay. I took more photos in here than in all of Singapore. If you're doing the gardens then you must do the Dome!"
,,Great way to spend a weekend!,5.0,,Awesome Waterfall at the entrance!!! Took my breath away! Be careful as some parts can me wet and slippery.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, do not miss a visit to this place, especially in the evening. They carry out misting around 8:00PM so try being around in Cloud Forest during that time"
,,"Second visit, just as enjoyable.",5.0,,"We watched the cloud forest and surrounding gardens etc being built a few years ago and visited for the first time in January 2014, this is an evolving project and the cloud forest is amazing giving visitors an opportunity to explore and see the habitat of many flowers and plants in a man made but very natural environment. Temparature controlled to imitate a mountain climate, you stroll around and see plants growing in a rich and dense explosion of colour and there is the sound and spray of the huge man made waterfall, brilliant and welcome coolness after a very hot walk in the outside gardens of Singapore. There is a cost as this is part of the Botanic gardens but as this is an ongoing and changing tourist attraction, well worth the visit to see for thye first time or revisit to see how it is changing."
,,Don't miss out,5.0,,"If you want to escape from the hot weather outside or simply you enjoy walk around in the jungle - this is the right place for you! Absolutely peaceful, fresh and green. Allow yourself at least one hour to enjoy the beauty of the Cloud Forest. You don't want to get inside and be in a hurry for your next stop from the list.
I would also recommend to visit on the bright part of the day as when the sun begins to set , inside becomes dark and the dim light can ruin your pictures or video."
,,So so..,2.0,,"When we first walked into cloud forest, we were welcomed by the man made waterfall, the floor was wet from this and as we walked past it, it got all over my legs. View was okay from the 7th floor but I would not return for the second time."
,,Refreshing stroll in the tropics,5.0,,"From the moment you enter, you're hit with fresh, cool breezes. The sound of the waterfall alone is pretty serene. This is basically a domed cloud forest featuring an array of plants and trees found within a cloud forest. With 7 levels to cover, it's a nice stroll to get out of the heat. You start at the ground level and can take the elevator to the 7th level to start from the top down. There's an indoor skywalk to give you sweeping views of the interior of the dome and the bay outside. Strollers and wheelchairs are easily accommodated here.

To avoid the crowds, get here before 1100 and you'll probably have more space than afterwards when the tour buses start to arrive. Getting here from the Gardens by the Bay Metro station doesn't take long. There are restaurants available on site, but check the hours as some open later than others."
,,"Very nice, the whole complex is worth a visit",4.0,,"Very good attraction, part of the Gardens by the Bay, which in all Ithink is unmissable. Cloud forest itself is good, very humid and quite cold so remember to bring a little jacket if you are somebody who tends to be cold."
,,Escape The Singapore Heat!,5.0,,"The first thing you notice when you enter the cloud forest is the dramatic drop in temperature as the mist from the cloud forest takes the bite out of the humid tropical weather. It was a welcome relief from a stuffy Singapore day.

Inside the cloud forest offers a number of terrace levels and walk throughout that let you explore this urban jungle.

I have been to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and it felt very familiar to the Asian cloud forest they are replicating in this beautiful garden.

If you are being the kids there are plenty of educationally information on display to help them learn and understand about the Eco systems we live in and our impact on the environment.

Definitely worth another visit next time I come back to singapore."
,,"WOW, What a unique experience",5.0,,"If you have limited time to visit the Gardens By The Bay, then this is the conservatory to choose. Difficult to describe as I have never seen anything like it before but try to imagine you are in a tropical forest but every type of trees, plants and flowers are in it. Waterfalls cascade down from great heights, trees tower above you and then you have the chance to look down onto this glorious scene, you are above the tree tops. Truly amazing. We spent around 2 hours in this conservatory alone so you need plenty of time to fully explore all.
Tip: You can get a shuttle trolley ($2 for a return ticket) from the entrance at Marina Bay Hotel entrance which takes you to the main ticket office. Also, if you only have time to visit one conservatory, ask at the ticket office for a one conservatory ticket at a cost of SD $16 otherwise you may think you have to visit 2 as the brochure only states a price for 2."
,,An unforgettable experience.. a feast for the senses,5.0,,"Interested in experience the coolness, quietness, and the mystery of rainforest while visiting Singapore? Buy a ticket for the Cloud Forest. It's a visit you'll never forget for the rest of your life (at least, that's the way it is for me)..
The Cloud Forest is a glass dome you can see from afar. Upon entering the dome, you'll feel the drastic drop of the temperature. You feel the coolness of the forest.
Walk several more steps and.. voila..
You are facing a very tall waterfall, and unforgettable one that would take your breath away, and make you forget that you are actually in a hot tropical country like Singapore.
Walk along the path and let all your senses feast on everything you see along the path. The greens, the old ferns, the smell, the crisp air, the trickling of water, everything.. it all just too much to be put in words, sorry..
At the end of the suggested path, take a short time to relax and watch the movie, what would happen to our earth in 50 years should we not take good care of our rainforest..
Out of the studio, walk a little bit and you'll find yourself in a secret garden, with a smaller waterfall, but with more tranquility.. it's a bit eerie to see the ferns on the wall and reading the explanation that this very fern comes from the real rainforest which is hundreds years old..
For less than 30 SGD, you get the ticket for entering the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. It's a very enjoyable and thoughtful experience at the same time.
I would definitely visit it again on my next trip to SIngapore."
,,Managed Wilderness,4.0,,Love the wilderness of this place. But don't go on a weekend or public holiday! The plants and waterfall are really soothing and beautiful in the middle of a busy day.
,,A must see,5.0,,I was simply bowled over by what lengths have Singapore govt gone to recreate the amazon forest and waterfalls. They have transported and maintain the same climate and temperature for each plant growing at respective heights in the mountain. Truly amazing how man made structures can effectively blend with nature
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Although, I enjoy most botanical gardens, this one is something different and will take your breath away. Try to visit during the ""misting"" which takes place every 2 hours for about 10 minutes as this adds another element to the whole experince. If you're lucky, you will see some extreme gardening going on by abseiling staff as they descend the ""mountain""."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"As much as this is a man made structure, the magnitude and splendor is amazing. It is apparently the tallest indoor man made waterfall! The lift to the top makes it easy on the legs! Be aware that you could get a little moist when you walk in to the donme and also when they mist the whole structure. A must see in Singapore. Well worth the fee."
,,Very pretty and dramatic,5.0,,"The first impression was of a huge waterfall as you walked in the door. Everything was well planted and there was lots of colour. We took the lift up and walked on the walkways in the ""clouds"", and then wound our way down. Very pretty and worth doing."
,,"Cloud forest a must see, flower dome not great!",5.0,,"As a tourist in Singapore you have to buy a ticket for both conservatories. If you have flown with Singapore airlines you can show your boarding passes (one for every ticket you want to buy) to get 10% off. If you go to both, go to the cloud forest last! The flower dome was a bit boring and quite busy. The cloud forest however was amazing. Such an entrance to see the waterfall, then you work you way around the whole area on various platforms. It was very interesting to me to learn about the supertrees and their unique purpose. They are not just for show but I won't say what they do here and ruin the surprise. Well maintained, good information, a bit cool so take a jumper and loads of flora and fauna. There is an audio tour that I wish I had done as there were markers everywhere for more information. I think this would add to the experience. Next time for sure ...... I highly recommend the chrysanthemum sorbet for sale at the ice cream stand outside the flower dome :)"
,,worth your time,5.0,,This was just a surprise. Come here if you also wanna escape the hot weather of Singapore. This is interesting place to walk around. the skywalk was abit scary at first but if you'll walk in the middle then there should be no problem. I just adore the waterfalls inside this cloud florest.
,,"""Good times in Singapore""",5.0,,"Amazing, don't miss them. The selection of plants and their placement under the waterfall enclosure was worth seeing. And it is wheel chair friendly."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"I loved, loved, loved this place. What magic! The huge dome holds a 7 story mountain complete with falls and vertical gardens. The walkway down is magical and a place to relax and enjoy the experience. Make sure you are there for the misting, when the place indeed fills with clouds. I wasn't sure it would be worth the entry, absolutely it was!"
,,Forest paradise,5.0,,"Breath taking entrance to the waterfall, and mist. more orchids, beautifully maintained gardens. lovely experience ,"
,,A great surprise,5.0,,Just taking a walk from the Sands hotel to come across this stunning park. So glad we visited and not expensive. Some wonderful photo's of the surroundings and the beautiful plants.
,,Unique Indoor Botanical Garden,5.0,,They have 2 indoor garden which is Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. But this Cloud Forest Dome was stunning! The building inside is unique and you can experience a fantasy world the moment you came inside. The ticket itself is a bit expensive but its worth it.
,,Take your time,3.0,,I visited Gardens by the bay in the middle of the day so it was nice to move inside to the Cloud Forest for a break from the heat. There are many beautiful plants and the waterfall is very cool. The technology displays and stalactite display seems out of place. Was call seeing the staff abseiling to weed the display
,,Amaizing place,5.0,,If you like nature you must go to see what they build over there. I think this is the largest waterfall build by humans. The cloud forest and the flower dome are spectacular places to visit.
,,Truly spectacular,5.0,,"A dream like visit to a mountain forest, with falls, winds and caves. Very interesting for kids and adults alike."
,,Amazing experience even if you don't like botanical gardens,5.0,,After entering the cloud dome you take a lift to the top and walk down via skywalk and escalators seeing different plants at different altitudes. Avoid if hights an issue for you.
,,amazing!!!!!,4.0,,"very amazing experience. I walked around absorbing it all in. I had to decide what was important for me, beings I had only one day! Sleep like a baby..."
,,Go there in the day time,5.0,,It is cool inside so go to get out of the heat of the day. It is a little bit boring but I rate it 5 stars as Singapore is more boring.
,,So Cool,5.0,,This was another amazing experience in Singapore. The whole mountain is larger than you think. the walk down is very interesting and the Multimedia pieces on the ground floor lets you think about climate change. Worth the entrance fee
,,Beautiful Attraction with Nice Temperature,4.0,,"Visited this attraction on a hot day , at the moment we enter we were amazed by the beautiful indoor waterfall and the nice cool temperature inside the dome. There are various plants inside this dome, but what attract me the most is the beautiful and big orchids growing inside. Definitely recommend both the cloud forest and flower dome for plant lovers out there."
,,Great!,5.0,,"What a strange thing! It's a cloud forest as advertised underneath a big dome. Very interesting, very cool, very worthwhile. You can even touch the many different plants."
,,A Wonderful MISTY mountain,5.0,,The 'misting' was happening when we visited...which was NICE on a Warm and Humid Singapore day! The lift UP to the Top made it a Very Pleasant Walk going Down! The Variety of plants and flowers on the Central Structure were just Lovely!! One Definitely should go to the Gardens by the Bay...and visit Both of the 'domes'... (as well as the Super Trees and its Walkway!!)
,,Indoor waterfalls,5.0,,Nice forest with indoor waterfalls... and you can find sky bridge also here... and it's very cold inside... so don't forget to use your sweater or double your tshirt...
,,Beautiful and educational,5.0,,"The waterfall is pretty incredible, so beautiful with all the flora growing around. Earth check is interesting and educational"
,,Excellant place,5.0,,"A paradise for plant lovers. There are different domes at Garden by the Bay. However, Cloud Forest was the Best. The indoor water fall is amazing."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,The water fall is surreal. The place has been maintained very well. A lift takes you to the top of the structure and one can walk down experiencing the greenary and cool breeze.
,,Astonishing,5.0,,"One of the best gardens I have visited. Beautifully laid out and massive, it needs a couple of hours to take it all in. The aerial walkways are stunning. Good disabled access too - lifts and wide aisles suitable for wheelchairs."
,,AMAZING - rainforest in a cloud,5.0,,Technology is amazing! great for photos! bring a good macro lens. It is definitely worth your money and worth a visit!
,,Just overhyped place,2.0,,"It is man made waterfall from height say 10 stroeys or so, but nothing enchanting about it i felt.. u can walk downwards gazing at the people & objects below... a bit of thrill for few but i didnt find it interesting at all.."
,,Cloud Forest - worth a visit,4.0,,An Avatar type feeling to this place. In the sweltering temperatures of Singapore a real Oasys! Reasonably priced I would recommend it for a visit when in Singapore
,,Nice,3.0,,This was a nice place but if i missed it i wouldnt be sad. Its really just a huge fake waterfall covered in flowers. It is nice to look at and my fave part was the garden made out of lego bricks. It was nice to see once but i have no desire to go again. Its also wet everywhere so can be slippery
,,Worth it,5.0,,"Such a beautiful set up and very much worth walking around. Plant lovers will adore this place, but it's also interesting and fun for everyone else. The indoor waterfall is pretty cool, and the skywalk is great."
,,better than Eden Project,5.0,,"Easy to traverse, good display, enjoyable. Well worth a visit, all specimens were clearly labelled and a very large and informative attraction."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,It is absolutely Beautiful! Carry a jacket with you as it gets cold near the waterfall sections. Loved viewing the Pitcher Plants. The cloud walk and treetop trail are not too scary - do try these.
,,A Georgraphical Masterpiece,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is positioned next to the Flower Dome and emulates a real life cloud forest environment. Inside this dome, is a 35-metre tall mountain covered in lush vegetation shrouding the world’s tallest indoor waterfall which is covered by plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000-metres above sea level.

As you climb up and around this mountain, you experience different flowers and plants and some which I have never seen before. One of the most fascinating parts of the Cloud Forest was when misting took place within the complex. This provided the plants with the moisture and climate they needed in order to survive, but this also created an eerie and dramatic misting effect on the mountain.

I would definitely recommend this as a place to visit while at the Gardens Of the Bay if you want to enjoy seeing a dramatic landscape of the mountain and the waterfall. You wont be disappointed and will be mesmerised by the sheer scale of the place."
,,waterfall in the garden,5.0,,"here, you can feeling that you are in the cloud forest as the name, you cant imagine how come the professinal can make it. dont forget bring your camera with."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Can't say much more but the Cloud Forest is a marvel and well worth the visit. The huge waterfall, flowers, plants and even LEGO captivates you wherever you focus your camera. Note very cold inside once you enter."
,,Heaven on earth,5.0,,Much much better than botanical gardens! I never wanted to leave! Please DO NOT forget to take your camera. It is an amazing place to take pics
,,Lost in wonder,5.0,,"Similar to the Eden project but much better. The thought, time and effort they have put into this project is awe inspiring, High walkways, enormous water falls, cliffs, tunnels and vertical gardens all beautifully designed to work together and it does. You do not have to be a garden nut to enjoy this.

Access is brilliant, it is a little cool but that is a joy too."
,,Lovely experience,4.0,,"Enjoyed the temperature especially it is very hot outside, the cooling atmosphere makes this place more attractive, very well organised setup, so that you will basically cover everything, despite of large crowd, you can still move around with amble space

A good place to bring overseas friends when I play host"
,,Amazing structure,4.0,,"This place is an example on just how far Singapore would do to create an outstanding tourist attraction, in the absence of land and natural resources it has to offer like other countries have. The structure is great, nice artificial waterfall and canopy walk. Still not comparable to the real ones in natural parks, but still this place is worth a visit when you're in Singapore and is looking for something else to do other than shopping."
,,Wow what else can i say,5.0,,This is a fantastic place to wander around in so cool after the heat outside.The height of it is very impressive and very well laid out.We enjoyed our time wandering around there.
,,awesome,5.0,,"fabulous waterfall fully accessible, very clever structure and information decks and nice to get in the cool"
,,"Beautiful, But Freezing",4.0,,"This is an amazing concept - the flowers are beautiful and the waterfall is stunning. However, the temperature inside is so cold as to be uncomfortable. We rushed through just so that we could get out and get warm. Tip: Take a jersey!"
,,a spectacular featue,5.0,,"This is a wonderful exhibit, be sure to allow yourself more time than you think you will need , from the moment you walk in and are confronted by the waterfall, the whole area is a delight"
,,"As your mother once said, take a sweater!",4.0,,"My sister, mother and I visited the Cloud Forrest in January 2015. The waterfall you see upon entering in incredible! The spray from the fall is very fresh and as the temperature is controlled within the dome I got quite cold after 15min (only wearing a summer dress). The forrest itself is quite beautiful. Great collection of plants and great information. The board walk is fantastic walk on, the height makes you feel giddy, but in a very fun way. If you're in the area and have a spare hour or two, visit the Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome. If you HAD to skip it, it wouldn't be a massive loss, but I think it's well worth the visit."
,,Astounding,5.0,,This is one of the most incredible places I've ever been. A biodome recreating a high altitude cool climate environment in the heart of tropical Singapore! Worth every minute and every cent to visit.
,,Truly amazing experience,5.0,,"Before visiting the Cloud Forest, I had read some reviews comparing it with the floating mountains in the movie Avatar. After visiting, I have to agree that they have done a great job at replicating the look and feel. You can easily spend about 1.5-2 hrs and should not miss the 'mist timings' when the entire forest turns 'misty'. If you are pressed for time and can cover either the Cloud Forest or the Flower Dome, I would definitely recommend the Cloud Forest"
,,Freezing Cold,3.0,,It was freezing cold so bring sweaters!:) Don't go up if you're afraid of heights. Not so much to see though.
,,Ingenious,5.0,,"The Cloud Dome, made you think about Climate change. The collection of plants are from all over the world and planted in their natural environment. Well worth the $5 million spent on the gardens as a whole.ow"
,,Wonderful Singapore.,5.0,,"They do it so well and it was very interesting too, plenty of signs to help you get around and plenty of really good toilets."
,,fun walk through the clouds,4.0,,"Great plants. Lovely walk. Beautiful waterfall. High humidity in the buliding. Glad we did it once. (No need to return again.) :) I do think they could have done a bit more with each level's ""landings"" as the one with the stalagmites and stalatites with a bit lame."
,,"Amazing place, a must visit",5.0,,"Its amazing, its situated inside garden by the bay. They have created altogether a different climate inside the cloud forest, there is artificial water fall and different vegetation."
,,The place is amazing…...,5.0,,The place is a part of Gardens By The Bay and it's purely amazing…... artificial environment My recommendation: While going to Gardens By The Bay to visit the all complex ( The 2 domes) and the gardens.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,Like: the concept is very good and the presentation is perfect. One should not miss this attraction during the visit to Singapore
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The moment you walk in from the heat outside you feel that you belong.The waterfall is the fist thing you see tumbling down from a man made mountain covered in beautiful plants. The walkways are cleverly constructed, where you walk in and out of the mountain to view the plants at there best.If you don't like gardens don't go."
,,Cool Off,4.0,,Spend a day at Gardens By The Bay. See the 2 bio domes. This one is a great place to cool off while sight seeing Singapore. Be sure to stay for the 7:45 or 8:45 Supertree Grove Light Show
,,Brilliant,4.0,,Amazing what can be built. There are plenty of spectacular photo opportunities every where in this structure. Sometimes it is difficult to remember where you actually are.
,,Awesome Trip to Cloud Forest,5.0,,"It brings you so close to everything this nature has to offer. Superb flaura and fauna. You feel like visiting best of the world at one place. Me & My wife loved the place so much, that we plan to visit it next year again."
,,Cloud forest - make sure you visit if you are in Singapore,5.0,,"Absolutely fantastic, highly recommended, a really great place to visit. Beautiful! Super easy to get to on the MRT. Loved it!"
,,Beautiful but not mindblowing,4.0,,"The cloud forest is extremely cool and beautiful, but overall pretty small and just takes about an hour tops to walk around. It's interesting to see all of the manmade structures and the waterfall is pretty. Overall, we gave it a ""meh"" but interesting to see!"
,,loved it,5.0,,Worth visiting. take out 3-4 hours and spend your time in this amazing place. i took my family there. we had to walk down in terrible sunny weather for long to get there. but it was all worth it
,,Amazing,5.0,,What an experience right from the moment you step inside. A must go on every visitors list. It's truly a piece of marvel. Lot of varieties of plants from around the world thriving in the controlled climate. Highly recommended...
,,Cloud Forest was better,4.0,,"Way better than the flower dome! I wouldn't do the flower one again, not worth it. They were both cold, too. The cloud forest was much cooler though!"
,,A soothing waterfall experience,5.0,,It is an attraction of the Gardens by the Bay. Very attractive man made waterfall at a height. The vegetation in the mountaneous surroundings is very attractive. Different types of flowers attract the visitors and compel them to take photographs. Very soothing experience of the waterfall. Had experience of misty surroundings as a part of the programme repeated frequently. Becomes very cool during the misty period. Walking through a special circular pathway is a very good experience. A good place for photography. Visit to this place is a must when you visit Singapore. Worth the money and efforts put in by the management.
,,Good to take Photos,4.0,,Lot of photos can be taken here. Its a very pleasant and cool atmosphere. we ended up spending a lot of time here.
,,Do not miss,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay, this is not to be missed
I first went two years ago when just opened, but this is so much more spectacular now it has matured.
The orchids and tropical flowers are beautiful, and there is the obligatory photo souvenir that you can have taken on entry.
Take the lift to the top and marvel at the mirror pond and the views on the way down. There are also lots of exhibits explaining about green environment and global warming"
,,Must do,5.0,,"Visited here in the evening. Absolutely superb under the lights, saw it again from outside during the day and (dare I say it) very plain looking in comparison. We loved every minute of the hour or 2 spent walking around the dome looking at all the plants. Believe us, fascinating with the lighting!

Other good point about an evening visit is the 8:45pm light show in the gardens, just a few minutes walk away. The dome closes at 9pm, suggest getting there by 7:30 if you also want to see the second light show."
,,On your to-do list,5.0,,"Part of the 2 domes at the Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest is even more spectacular than the Flower Dome...definitely a place you do not want to miss in Singapore. The waterfall will make you feel right in the middle of the jungle!"
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,The cloud forest was very different to any attraction I have seen. An amazing attraction well worth the money.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Not to be missed! Buy ticket with cash and you avoid huge lines. Go to top and see everything. Movie about global warming focused on examples in USA which was a little biased but otherwise informative. When film reviewed how we as individuals can help with global warming and saving our planet, everyone but my husband and I stayed which was a sad example of how most don't care."
,,A definite visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Huge dome with high waterfall showing the different plants at different places in the cloud forest. Visitors have to purchase both this and the Flower Dome together (which is a pity, because this is the better one by far). Basement exhibition somewhat disappointing."
,,The best place after a long walk,5.0,,"The cloud forest has the best soothing expierence as you enter inside with its waterfall and cool area,that the best place rather to see in garden by the bay"
,,very educational,5.0,,Great experience and wonderful structure. Absolutely love being in the clouds. A little cool inside so take something light to cover up
,,"loved it, beautiful forest.",5.0,,"very nice placed to spend an hour, beautiful setups, bring your camera and maybe a shirt because it cooled down. But I loved it, and the have a 1$ shuttle bus that'll pick you up at the metro station, with was the way I came. And after you're done, then you can see the flower dome next door, which is equally beautiful. Just buy the combo ticket, you will not regret it."
,,good for 1st time visitors and nature lovers,5.0,,"If you enjoy experiencing nature, definitely visit this if you haven't. But there is little point to come for a second time since the dome doesn't change much. Bring a jacket, especially if the outdoors are raining."
,,WOW...,5.0,,All I can say is WOW......... Man-made waterfall.....so high up in the 'indoor sky'..... The unique thing is...you can walk around the upper edge of the waterfall through a special circular pathway... Definitely an experience....!!!!! A MUST VISIT!!!!!!
,,An amazing man made forest,5.0,,An indoor attraction that is part of the Gardens by the Bay. It is absolutely beautiful - where else in the world can you climb an indoor mountain surrounded by tropical vegetation with the background sounds of a huge waterfall. I visited earlier in the day and then got a stamp so I could return later on to show friends. A photographers paradise. It is truly beautiful and is more than decorative. It has an environmental purpose.
,,Pretty Views,5.0,,Stunning a top the trees that appear man made. Walking through here is quite majestic. Night time views and light shows are amazing
,,Worth the money,5.0,,We were unable to visit both domes on the same day as the Cloud Forest was closed. We made it to the Cloud Forest on the next visit. A fantastic experience.
,,Impressive Structure & a Wonderful Reprieve from the Heat,5.0,,"The waterfall was easily impressive. The elevated trail gave good vintage points. I spent more than a good hour there just strolling along the cool & misty greenery, which invoked much leisure conversation & regaling of family tales. Get ticket online before hand to avoid the line. Unfortunately, non-residents could only get Cloud Forest & Flower Dome combo package, And the Flower Dome wasn't not much more than big indoor garden. Lunch at the Satay by the Bay, which offers much more than satay."
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"Great ingenuity, well cultivated ,well kept, great views facilitated through elevated walkways , are a charm Misting though talked about needs more intensity and some more lighting effects"
,,"Gardens on the Bay, singapore",5.0,,"Everything..fantastic waterfall and the tropical orchids, ferns etc are unreal..Great for education on the natural environment."
,,Wonderful and Amazing - definitely worth it!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest was breathtaking and features a cloud mountain and large waterfall that you can walk through using escalators and suspension bridges. The Forest is designed to replicate a tropical mountain and contains a variety of plant life on numerous different levels (each with a different theme). Note that the forest is a bit cool so take a sweater if you think this could be an issue. If choosing between the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, go with the Cloud Forest."
,,Wow !!!,5.0,,"Amazing display of gardens and waterfalls and a amazing bridge walk, walk around for hours.They have 2 times a day for cloud transformations displays but unfortunately we missed it."
,,impressive and imaginative,4.0,,in Singapore they don't do the understated. This glasshouse structure holds its own amongst the other impressive structures in the city. It offers waterfalls vertical planting and education on the environment. Impressive if not to everybody's taste. Worth a visit but you would not want to come again.
,,Futuristic place : A scientific wonder,5.0,,"From a distance one gets the feel that you are entering a place designed for the future. Its a engineering and botanical marvel. From the man-made waterfall to the entire structure harboring the innumerable variety of plants based on a theme of climate change seen as one ascends from the tropical into the alpine and beyond - it is really mesmerizing. The walkways are true designs of ingenuity.
Here one get a glimpse of what our future is to come!"
,,"Beautiful garden, good retreat from the heat",5.0,,"Within Gardens by the Bay, ticket prices to enter the two glass domes, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, are quite pricey for foreigners ($28) but turned out to be really worthwhile. The Cloud Forest, in particular, with its big waterfall, orchids and colourful foliage, is one of the most beautiful gardens I've even seen.

Best of all it's air conditioned, giving much relief from the unbearable heat outside. Escape the heat during the hottest time to the day. I'd suggest going really early in the morning and do the outdoor bits before going into the domes, or going late afternoon and seeing the domes before coming outside in the early evening."
,,Unique garden,5.0,,"The indoor artificial mountain is covered with plants and flowers of all kinds, It even has a waterfall. The visitor can ascend on the walkway which goes around up to the top."
,,A great display.,4.0,,"It was really spectacular to look at. Just walls of plants, orchids and waterfalls. Very good display. My advise to women who go there, do not wear a dress. You are walking on an open walkway above other people."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Fascinating structure. Allow plenty of time to take it all in, so much information. Waterfall stupendous."
,,amazing job,5.0,,the forest made with all eco products is amazing job and then there is a waterfall inside and so many plants will make u awestruck
,,Better than forest dome,4.0,,"Try to visit in daylight.
Don't miss the top level.

Accessible by road or via BayFront MRT station, Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful garden within the central business district of Singapore. Entry is free, except for the 2 observatories (flier dome and cloud forest). Tickets for both observatories are required to be utilized on the same day.

While, Flower dome showcases different flowers based on geography, Cloud forest is made out to explain differences in flora and fauna based on heights. It also showcases the limestone formations caused by thousands of years of dripping water that percolates within rocks.

Info about rest of the gardens by the bay:
Gardens is spread over a huge area and connected with other parks in the vicinity. The park encompasses as a seemingly artificially river, OCBC Sky walk (a curved bridge at a height offering nice view and chargeable at $5/- per pax), flora and fauna of the 3 major ethnicities in Singapore - the Chinese, Malay and Indian, huge tree like structures, F&B areas and a children water play area. All this is free.

Observatories are ticketed. There are agents in Chinatown and other areas as well As online selling tickets at discounted rates. Also, there are discounts for certain categories like sr citizens and free tickets for young children. Take vendor of these instead of just paying tickets based on headcount.

Try to visit observatories in daylight as they are too dimly lit for you to observe the plants or read the explanation."
,,WORTH YOUR TIME,5.0,,"Being away from busy city is really relaxing and in singapore, you can this visit this place. this is a very educational place and you will get a lot of things to learn by just walking around. Great views inside and out. Perfect for a family and friends day out."
,,Impressive building,4.0,,Enjoyed a relaxing hour wandering about during a six hour transit in Singapore. Our visit was at night. The lighting made it especially pleasant and there were not a lot of other visitors at the time.
,,Cool and relaxing.,5.0,,"Away from the bustle of the shops etc, defiantly worth the visit. Small cost & spent over an hour here. Also a lovely reprieve from the humidity outside! Very educational at the end with lots of info on the way round. A very calm & peaceful walk around with great views from inside & out!
Defiantly recommended."
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,A short walk from marina bay sands not expensive and totally amazing! Go early less crowds and be there for misting time!
,,Brought out my inner child,5.0,,Mesmerising magical structures. First visited last year during a brief stopover but had to come back to see it again. Love it. Great free public space.
,,OK for the price,3.0,,I liked the indoor waterfall and the abundant plants. The model railway was a quirky part of the garden. I got the impression that the educational information was rather ignored by most visitors which was a pity as it is well done.
,,Cloud forrest,4.0,,"Very pretty, waterfall and misty, variety of flowers and plants. Several levels, to explore. $28 to view, but a nice way to spend a few hours nice."
,,Well worth a Visit,5.0,,A great place to include if you are visiting the Gardens by the Bay. There are three levels on this site so some climbing of stairs will have to be done.
,,Thrilling!!,5.0,,very nice indoor scheme of rain forest..very nice walk inside and living that experience..go to the top of he mountain.
,,favorite part of GBTB,5.0,,This is my favorite part of the GBTB. The Waterfalls are spectacular. Love the air conditioning in the gardens. The walkways are wonderful. The plants are unbelievable.
,,Worth it,5.0,,We bought our tickets at the Airport so we didn't have to wait in line to purchase the tickets the forest it self was nice and beautiful and nice peaceful vibe to it.
,,Something different,4.0,,"Not free but is something different and done well. Kids would be memorised by it, it feels like a misty rainforest setting whilst walking through the clouds and seeing all the plants"
,,An experience to be in the mountain,4.0,,"it's a place simulating the environment of mountain with high moisture, temperature is cool comparing to the scorching hot outside. Need to walk a certain distance if you are coming from the Sands."
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,Artificial waterfall ! Artificial mountain ... all the artifacts and collections !! It was a wonderful experience - also with a gerat view from the top !
,,Highlight of my stay in Singapore!,5.0,,"Stunning in every aspect. Many various plants, great atmosphere, very well designed. Great exhibitions on climatology, meteorology inside, too. Not to mention the temperature and the fresh air inside - a shelter from singaporean heat. Ticket to Cloud Forest Dome & Flower Dome costs 28 SGD. Totally worth it, though! A MUST in Singapore!"
,,A Beautiful Must See!,5.0,,"the Cloud Forest is a beautiful experience. Take the elevator to the top and walk down the suspended walkways. My girlfriend, who is afraid of heights managed to walk down the walkways by staying in the middle of them. The waterfall is incredible and the way they have arranged all the plants and flowers is a sight to behold. It can be a little chilly as they mist the plants every once in awhile, so it is advisable to bring a sweater. There are panels with written notes every now and again which explains a lot about the flora there. Please go and see the movie on the way out as it explains a lot about global warming and how much Singapore is doing to protect the earth. Such an interesting film going from 2000 all the way up to the year 3000 and what can happen to our planet.
You need about 2 hours to see this, and I would rate this as the best attraction we saw. There are shops and washroom facilities there. This is all part of the Gardens by the Bay, and if you walk up from the cloud forest there is an aquarium nearby and a kids splash pad. We found these only because we went exploring after we missed our bus!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Wish we had a bit more time to spend. Well designed and has a variety of exotic plants. Value for money!
,,Amazing,4.0,,"When I went into this dome, my only experience of something similar was the Eden Project in Cornwall UK. So when I got in to see what looked liked a mountain and a waterfall - all inside the dome - I was impressed!
You the take a lift to the top of the ""mountain"" and walk down a load of exhibits on the inside, and on each level you are able to stand behind the waterfall.
It's a very impressive thing, stunning to look at and also the ecological theme of the internal exhibition was very interesting.
Definitely worth a look."
,,Must see,5.0,,"I only had one day to spend in Singapore and a friend recommended a trip here. It was definitely worth it. Not only was the area beautiful and filled with all kinds of interesting plants, it was also very educational about the importance of protecting the environment. It was really cool to see that such a big effort is being put into green city living and tourism."
,,Stunning giant waterfall,5.0,,"The 4-5 story high waterfall is incredible, as is the walk through the site. Please view the Global Warming movie which is a very sobering look at a huge problem in our world. You will feel the need to react to save our planet."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This is such an interesting place with a high waterfall that you can walk behind on the suspended walkways. It can be quite wet (take something to protect cameras) as they mist every few hours and there are misting areas on some of the plants as you go around. The suspended walkways are high although you do not have to go to the top if you don't fancy it. A vast selection of trees, plants and exotic flowers."
,,The Fall!!,4.0,,Man made created water fall more than 100 feet...chilling weather inside dome...fabulously built 7 floors...
,,Must see,5.0,,This is amazing and beautiful. Make sure to visit during a misting time where mist fills the dome to water the plants. It is breathtaking.
,,Not to be mist!,5.0,,I was overwhelmed and thrilled with my visit here---the quality and quantity and placement of the flowers flowering plants and other plants with colorful foliage was superb! The text panels throughout made the visit more interesting as well.
,,Make time in Singapore for the Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Featuring an 8 story rain forest mountainside and 6 story waterfall in an air conditioned environment, the Cloud Forest in Gardens By the Bay is a must see. The waterfall that greets you as you walk into the forest alone is worth the trip, but after the elevator ride to the top, the plants placed on each level as you walk down, coupled with breathtaking views of Singapore through the glass walls is well worth the time and entry fee. Here you will learn about the high mountain ecosystems and see plants you would never see at home. Know that there are many people who stop in the middle of the walkway to take photos of themselves. If you go, you will understand why."
,,nice thought,5.0,,"Singapore is a concrete jungle with no natural beauty, so this is a pleasant sight for the local people. In a city that is artificial & sanitized, this is a pleasant break even when you are on vacation."
,,A bad hair day!,5.0,,"It was really worth coming out with 'hair from hell ' to take time to explore this amazing man-made misty mountain of jungle, flowers, water and plants. What a very clever way of displaying nature in a very accessible way. Remarkable."
,,Call me misty!,5.0,,"Really gives you a sense of what the environment is like up really high without having to experience the negative effects of altitude. Lots of orchids and ferns and other intriguing plants and you always have the sound of the waterfall no matter where you are. With an elevator and the ramp, it is quite accessible for everyone, but not if heights give you a problem."
,,wow,5.0,,You completely forgot you were in a dome. It was just breathtaking. when you walk in and see that large waterfall it just is amazing. The information I learned in there was amazing and I would go again for sure. Just an amazing thing to see.
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,A sense of being in the rainforest with the scents and sounds all around you. Beauty on all levels as you experience all the different layers of the canopy.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Definite must see not only for those who love flowers / plants but for those who appreciate a beautiful well designed and executed attraction. Easy to get around however if heights aren't your thing the higher reaches might be a bit challenging!!
,,Nice design of the building,3.0,,"The garden bay is known as one of the best garden in south east Asia. Even though everything is carefully designed and well-arranged, it is not beautiful as others' gardens in China or Vietnam.

Nothing much to see here, this place is definitely not suitable for young active people. I would recommend this place for middle age travellers who want to relax and enjoy the natural atmosphere in Singapore."
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"This attraction, in one of the biodomes at the Gardens in the Bay, is a must visit. You ascend by lift to the top of the dome, and emerge onto a series of aerial walkways which take you around the near vertical rainforest exhibit. The plants are amazing, but the concept and architecture are the real stars."
,,Cloud Forest : an amazing place in Singapore.,5.0,,"When I was in skypark at the top of Marina Bay Sands, I was amazed by those two scallop shells in the gardens. And curious to see what they sheltered. One of those scallop shells shelters Cloud Forest. I could see first the highest indoor waterfall in the world. I could wander above the marvels on the aerial walkways and in the hill."
,,Feel of the high altitude mountains,3.0,,"What has been done is wondrous, but as an attraction to visit, I didn't find this as good as my expectation."
,,A great place to send a quiet couple of hours,5.0,,Kept at a cool 20 degrees C the cloud forest is a great place to explore away from the steaming heat of the city. The exibits are magnificent and the waterfall feature amazing. A must visit when in Singapore.
,,Awesome structure,5.0,,"A definite must see, an amazing structure with lots of foliage where one can walk all around and there's a huge waterfall."
,,A wonderful site to visit,5.0,,It was very beautiful and creatively done. We enjoyed walking through all the plantings and different levels immensely.
,,Unbelievable waterfall feature.,5.0,,"As you enter all you hear is the sound of falling water and gasps from the guests in awe of the feature ahead. Very well planned out and organised. Absolutely fantastic. Singapore has a lot to offer especially horticulturally but this is just off the scale.
The water vapour and lower temperature create a welcome relief from the intensity of the mid day heat of Singapore."
,,Awesome,5.0,,I normally do not rate things as excellent. This is a must see place in Singapore! It is convenient to get to and is certainly worth the time going. I was amazed of this and what a great job they have done at this place.
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,"The waterfall, and cloud walk will transport you to another world! If you're a plant lover you'll go crazy- need I say more?"
,,Unique and A must Go!!,5.0,,"The title says it all. It is worth the entry fees. I would advice that you purchase your tickets online. Upon entering the conservatory, you are greeted by a majestic view of the waterfall. Which is AMAZING!! I would recommend that you start from top-to-bottom. The view there was great! I would definitely go here again! Btw, bring your jacket or sweater along if you can't stand cold. It is cold inside the cloud forest. Enjoy!!"
,,wow ....... an amazing experience at night,5.0,,"You must see this cloud forest at night with lights and music, this is an amazing Free...... Yes Free show after dark. It will take your breath away, if you only do one thing in Singapore this is it."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,This was just an amazing experience. We could have spent all day just in this dome. The final 5 degrees experience was mind blowing and very informative. We all left thinking what more we should be doing to help our planet. This is a truly magnificent feat of architecture and bioscience. A really must see for the whole family.
,,A glorious light show,5.0,,"An visit to Singapore should include a visit to the Cloud Forest nightly light show. The cloud is certainly impressive during daylight but it is glorious at night with the lighting show that can either be viewed from ground level or from the gantry. This view is one not to be missed so if you are not a sufferer of vertigo it is a must to pay the $5 fee to travel up onto the gantry to watch this marvellous display. You combine the Cloud Forest light show and the back drop of the Marina Sands and the Gardens by the Bay at night, then you can imagine images that will take you breath away."
,,Fascinating place,5.0,,"It's a fascinating place and we loved the cloud forest, the moment we set foot in. Enter the Cloud Forest, a tall mountain covered in lush vegetation, shrouding the world’s tallest indoor waterfall, which showcases plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000 mts above sea level. You can ascend to the mountaintop in comfort by lift before descending via walkways for an aerial view of the mountainside below. The walkways are quite wide so you can stop at any time for photos without getting in anyone's way. This is a good place to learn about unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests and the environmental threats they face."
,,magical,5.0,,"this is breathtaking! A must see within the gardens. The heights can be a bit dizzying but the smell and the feeling inside it, was just amazing. I have nothing more to say about it, you just have to see it to believe it!"
,,Mesmerizing !,5.0,,The entire gardens by the bay is beautifully done but Cloud Forest takes the cake for being the best among the best. The waterfall and cloud walk will take you to a different world. Take your time and spend maximum time at this place.
,,Unique Conservatory,5.0,,"An unique construction of a Conservatory.. a wide range of lush vegetation, encasing the world's tallest indoor waterfall and 9 unique zones in this cool-moist Conservatory. Would visit again for a more detailed observation."
,,Do bring a jacket when making a trip there,5.0,,It was evening when we went there. Therefore it was rather hard to take pictures as the lightings were not very bright. There is a huge waterfall so it can be quite cold there. Remember to bring a jacket. Overall nice scenery.
,,An Hour Well Spent,4.0,,A Beautiful Natural Museum - reminds me of the Hemisphereic museum in Valencia Spain. Bring a light jacket or sweater as it is a little cool inside.
,,Mist Forest,4.0,,Very good. Once you have done the garden dome do the mountain dome. Cannot see anywhere else in the world. Forward thinking. After doing the mountain grab a bight to eat and wait to early dark and see the light spectacular with the trees. Must see this show and its free. Just majic.
,,Take your time and enjoy,5.0,,"There is an elevator to the top for handicap accessibility, some easy ramps and some height views that are a challenge for those that don't like heights."
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,"A lovely walk through water related plants, includes a waterfall. Watch out for the misting at certain times. Fun for the kids! This is better than the nearby Flower Dome."
,,indoor nature rain forest,5.0,,Singapore had amazing idea by built this indoor rain forest. i was amaze how they could build it. there is different plant from each level of terrain. from highland to lower. take your kids here and learn how they should keep the forest. also there is movie about global warming. excellent place.
,,Interesting and refreshing,3.0,,A biosphere type of structure where plants are showcased along with various sculptures at various levels. Was nice to walk around and look out at the view. Would not put it in top things to do but it was relaxing.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Unusual structure with an abundance of foliage. Go straight to the top and work your way down, less effort that way."
,,Wow!!!,4.0,,"Go up the Cloud Forest and you'd feel like you're soaring!!!! It might not be as high as the Marina Bay Sands, but you'd feel like its so high since you'd be walking on steel balcony-like bridges enclosed in sky-high glass domes...."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,It was just lovely to visit and the waterfalls were amazing. The skywalk was great and views were awesome.
,,A gardener's delight,5.0,,Welcome to the waterfall which cools you and sets the atmospheric od damp and slight chill that is perfect for bromeliads and phalenopsis orchids. The path twists and turns as you change height through the garden. A great use of space.
,,A Must see.,5.0,,Was Brilliant. A must see for any visitor to Singapore. Take your time and enjoy the many Orchids and there beutiful colours.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"This wonderful place is next to the Flower Dome, and definitely worth including on any itinerary. Waterfalls, crystal rock formations and many different plants and trees make this a fascinating place to visit also."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We had just an amazing time, so beautiful with lots of information about cloud forests and climate change. Would highly highly recommend."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We loved the cloud forest, from the moment we entered and saw the waterfall. The signs are clear and easy to follow. The views from the top are really good. The walkways are quite wide so you can stop at any time for photos without getting in anyone's way. Very well laid out"
,,Interesting,4.0,,Interesting but not outstanding despite the highest manmade waterfall. Inside the dome is quite damp and also “cold” so a good advice is to have something on your shoulders if you are sensitive to cold
,,Technology at work,4.0,,It's a fascinating site. A well planned and executed idea of bringing a wide variety of plants under one easily accessible roof. We saw some rare varieties of plants which were flourishing in the well maintained conditions.
,,Great Experince!,5.0,,"Really cool place. You start at the top (in the clouds) and walk your way down (through the different layers of the atmosphere (i.e. tree top rain forest, waterfall area, mid-forest and floor). Good for kids too."
,,Loved everything about it,4.0,,A man made marvel the waterfalls the plant life. It was a cool oasis I a hot and humid city. There was nothing to dislike about this place.
,,stunning orchards,4.0,,"loved the orchids and the way they managed to get all the plants up on the frames,, beautiful colours and not too crowded when we went"
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is simply beautifu - towering walkways, a stunning birds eye view of the surrounds, and serveral gorgeous waterfalls. Caution if you are scared of heights, definately don't look down! It is an archiectural wonder of flowers and forest, certainly worth the trip down! You will be sure to take some wonderful photos."
,,Very very good,5.0,,"As the name suggests, beautifully created cloud forest environment. There's a stunning waterfall, great views from the top and thoughful detailing of environment conservation. Worth a visit"
,,Unique forest - an interesting blend of nature and technology.,4.0,,"It's unique - an interesting blend of nature and technology. It has some interesting floras from all over the world. The carnivorous plants were interesting, not something you see everyday. It's an easy self-pace, and it's a little chilly, so maybe bring a light overthrown if you get chilly easily."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Indoor waterfalls, cloud forest plants. Upper walkway to walk through the clouds. I met many other tourist while there and everyone was so impressed."
,,"Great dome, really cold, a bit expensive",4.0,,"Price is a bit too high for non local, but the flowers and the fake mountain is impressive to see. Bring along a jacket it is really cold inside."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit the place is outstanding and the plants and displays are stunning,the place is spotless for the amount visitors it gets."
,,So much better than I thought it would be!,5.0,,"This is amazing! We were skeptical at first, but were blown away. Even our 11-month-old enjoyed it. Go for the misting!"
,,Cloud forest....Unbelievable,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is artificially created which replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions. Accessible by an elevator, and visitors are able to descend the mountain via a circular. Waterfall provides visitors with refreshing cool air."
,,Amazing Amazing Amazing,5.0,,"Go view, have a drink in the big tree, take the lift. Do it. end of. A amazing experiance you have to be there to understand this."
,,Sensational,5.0,,"Like all displays. our previous visit to Singapore the Gardens by the bay were just being constructed, so we returned to see completed gardens"
,,Magical,5.0,,When i heard the word cloud forest i did not imagine it would be something so beautiful and magical. Loved the way the dome has been done up making science more interesting. I wanted to click each and every corner but obviously nothing compares to the real thing!
,,Nice and cool,3.0,,I found this dome a little meh. The waterfall was nice and cooling but the rest a bit boring. The flower dome was much nicer.
,,Man made marvel,5.0,,"Awesome, wonderful and marvelous. This man made eco-friendly structure gives an insight to construct 'green cities' on earth which will be planet friendly in all aspects and helpful to mankind."
,,Wonderful biosphere,5.0,,"Loved the soft cloudy rainfall, its very cooling and gives you a sense of how wonderful nature can be when interposed with all the comforts of urban living. Which encapsulates the whole idea of a 'Garden City' within a tiny pod of sorts. Worth a visit!"
,,The modern hanging gardens of Babylon,4.0,,"From an engineering point of view, a marvel! A completely man made environment with a natural climatic feel, but the architecture/landscape forces you to ""not forget"" that the environment is artificial.

They claim that the environment is eco-friendly, despite the significant artificial efforts to maintain it, particularly the energy consumption.

I would call it a sort of case study for experiential learning, particularly in to more commercial than display aspects, such as vertical agriculture."
,,Not for the Faint Hearted!,3.0,,"The flower Dome is very well presented with an abundance of exotic plants and some brilliant sculptures (some apparently based on the jarrah trees of Western Australia). I did enjoy this attraction very much and well worth the admission price.

The Cloud Garden is an indoor garden setting, all built around a cascading waterfall, which drops several storeys. If you take a lift to the top level, there is a narrow steel walkway, which meanders all the way down to ground level and as you walk down this walkway, there is a fine mist of water that sprays on to you from the afore mentioned waterfall with a wonderful array of plants/flowers on view.

In honesty, I found the experience a tad daunting and to the best of my knowledge, do not have a problem with heights. To be fair, the walkway is a very gentle slope down but just the height and the fact that you can see through the walkway is a bit disconcerting, so would imagine anyone with even slight vertigo would be struggling to cope with this attraction. In honesty, not my favourite memory of Singapore and probably would not visit this attraction again,"
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,We spent a wonderful day exploring the amazing gardens and can only say 'wow'. The displays were just incredible and can highly recommend visiting.
,,Dont leave this off your list,5.0,,"Amazing development, very tastefully done & an unusual & special experience. Allow some time so you can linger as the view from up there is worth it."
,,Artificial landscape,4.0,,"There are 2 paid attractions in Gardens By the Bay. If you have to pick one, do the Flower Dome. The Cloud Forest is a decent indoor landscape garden with a waterfall as its center piece. 7 levels high, you can take the elevator all the way up and walk down all the way to the Secret Garden. Plants, long walkways in the air, and a nice cool enviornment.

There is a rather cheesy crystal display floor.

I think this can be done in an hour or so."
,,Worth it,5.0,,It's a very pleasant experience walking around at heights. They usually have some discounts on the tickets if people have travelled via Singapore Airlines.
,,Amazing!,4.0,,Truly amazing! Don't not visit because you think it's boring because it's not! Walk inside and check out the displays and be prepared to be mesmerised. You won't regret it.
,,Beautiful indoor waterfall,4.0,,"Be prepared to be amazed.
The indoor waterfall is really something special, must be seen. Come by during the day to really get a good view of all the plants especially if you want to capture some beautiful photos. Bring a cardigan as it does get cold!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Loved everything! It is such an amazing place! It's massive inside, so many different levels and so much to see! Best to go during the day."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Thewaterfall is amazing. The planting beautiful. You can walk right up to the top or take the lift. Stunning.
,,Artificial,3.0,,"Towards the end of the visit, they show you a little -excellent- movie on global warming. But look, what is the ecological imprints of these buildings, of Singapore in general, of Singaporean habits?
High entrance price, long queues. And nothing to compare with real rainforests. But so cute for a selfie of me in front of the great cascade..."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay, this section, and the Flower Dome, should be left to last, as they are truly the best. Wander up and around a waterfall highlighted interior garden spectacular featuring magnificent specimens of many plants."
,,Awesome,5.0,,What a great relaxing time and beautiful. Such a clever way to experience the mountains and the plants that prefer that kind at air. Waterfall was a great way to start adventure.
,,Fantastic place unique,5.0,,"During our visit to Singapore we went to Cloud Forest, incredible place unique in the world. between waterfall, flowers, minerals is beautiful. We had a great family day, a place to see if you visit Singapore, a must. take care.Claudio"
,,Refreshing,5.0,,"Its very cool,refreshing and amazing what they did there.try to go on day time..around 6 pm we arrived and was clouds working and really feel like in the heaven.worth the experiance"
,,Cloud on the earth,5.0,,Its a kind of place which you can never imagine. Awesome place to peoples who loves nature. Overall its a true copy of our nature which was same as 200 years back. Visit this place if you visit to Singapore.
,,Come earlier before night,5.0,,"Too bad we enter Cloud Forest too late, 7 PM. It's already night so we can't see the plants really well, it's just too dark to see each of them. But we must admit that the skybridge is one of a must! It gives stunning view yet excitement feeling when walking through the bridge. The weather is so cold inside, didn't get a chance to enter the +5 degree zone as we afraid we would get freezes."
,,Great day out!,5.0,,Cloud Forest is definitely worth visiting. Was amazing to see the different levels of the dome and feel the micro-climates that they have created. Loved the Secret Garden and the Climate exhibition. The fact the whole place is self-sustaining is really impressive and it will be interesting to see how the dome develops over time.
,,Mature Australian couple,5.0,,"Wow! Amazing. They have done such a good job! It was so interesting, refreshing and a delight to visit. The waterful was fantastic and the planting exceptional!"
,,Another must see in Singapore,5.0,,A must see if you go to Garden By The Bay. Well worth the small admission price. Waterfalls and vegetation with elevations and walkways.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Quite the experience being there! The architecture of the place, technology used, as well as the plants and flowers...everything was amazing."
,,Something different in Singapore,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome in the Gardens by the Bay are an interesting and exciting experience.

Upon entering, you are greeted by a waterfall flowing over a mountain. Within and around the mountain, at different altitudes are plants and trees that can be found at different altitudes.

This attraction is informative, interactive and fun."
,,Jannat Yahan,5.0,,"Man made wonder, no wonder. Take atleast 1.5 hours to cover this exceptional piece of technology and art. Man made close to nature."
,,Average visit,3.0,,"Guys if u r visiting Gardens by the bay you can buy the tickets of Cloud forest as well. its just 10 $ but not much worth visiting. Better to visit two domes of Gardens by the Bay spend some time in gardens and by evening move towards Marina Bay Sands Skywalk.

message me if anything more you would like to know."
,,"Though artificial, nice place to visit",4.0,,It is a man made giant waterfall with a staircase to go around the waterfall. As I have visited about 100 of natural waterfalls this was nothing for me. But I would like to appreciate this creation as a wonderful one. If you visit at gardens by the bay and flower dome never miss this as well.
,,Magical,5.0,,A great way to spend a couple of hours. A mountain and a waterfall - a huge one - inside a greenhouse. Lots to see lots to read. Excellent.
,,Singapore is going green,4.0,,"Some lungs for Singapore. give it a year and the planting should have matured fully. Some parts still look new, skeletal but overall it is a lovely place to stroll around, admire the plants and if you want to pay, enter the huge domes that contain impressive artificial environments to show rainforests or a Mediterranean environment. There are cafes and restaurants and it is all in easy reach of the Marina Sands complex and Metro station."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"We went there around 18.00 then machines started to make artificial fog it was amazing experience/view. Promenade at around 22-30 m above ground with big variety of different flowers/trees was unforgettable.

You can ask for a stamp and return to CF after some refreshment or when they light everything up..."
,,Nicely made,4.0,,"The Gardens by the bay in itself are very serene. The Cloud forest is a man made beauty . Nicely designed cooled conservatory was a very refreshing experience during the heat and humidity. It was a very unique experience , one of its kind ."
,,This has got to be one of the most wonderful things to see,5.0,,This and the flower dome plus the garden by the bay you need two days for your visit and yo will still miss parts of it. Its fantastic
,,Technological marvel,5.0,,"The cloud forest dome is another attraction in the Gardens by the bay. This also requires tickets, and is expensive. But it is impressive. They have managed to build a really high glass dome with airconditioning. There are lifts for going up, it is a long way to the top. The cool atmosphere really gives you the feel of going up a mountain forest. There is a big waterfall near the entrance which is a sight to watch. There is also a short filmshow inside to increase awareness about global warming and envirionment. After going to the top, you can walk down a long bridge , really a nice experience. Tickets for this also can be obtained from travel agents at a reduced rate than what they sell at the counter"
,,Exeptional place to relax and watch light show supported by music,5.0,,"We visited the place when it was turning dark and we were lucky because there is a light and music show! You can lay down in surroundings and just enjoy it! MUST SEE place, no words to describe excellent feelings! I would suggest to visit the place for everyone!!"
,,Avatar Set,5.0,,"An amazing, spectacular sight to behold. Waited around to go up into the trees ready for the light show, but it rained, so the lifts were shut down, very disappointing, but we still thoroughly enjoyed the show from the ground level.... awesome display."
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,A really nice place to visit and lovely and cool inside to escape the heat! Have an iced coffee in the restaurant. Probably not great if you don't like heights!!
,,School Photography Club Visit,4.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest to let the new Sec Ones try out their new cameras and show us skills learnt from all the lessons we've been giving them. The place is okay, not bad, but a bit chilly so might want a sweater. Its a bit crowded, even on weekdays so be prepared to stand for most of your visit as the benches and chairs provided will be occupied by either old ladies or foreign visitors."
,,Artificial + Nature,5.0,,"Amazing artificially enclosed Nature. One should visit to experience this place. Variety of plants, ponds, waterfalls...all inside a Jiant Dome. Architecture marvel ."
,,Spin out,5.0,,"My partner and I visited with little idea of what to expect. We were both blown away by the building, plants and waterfall. We visited early so crowds weren't too bad. Very peaceful."
,,Beautiful and fun.,5.0,,"Tremendously fun. Some may not like the height, but the winding path through tropical gardens is a wow -- both an architectural feat, and a botanical beauty. Totally entertaining, and like the flower dome, good for all ages."
,,oasis,5.0,,Concept very original. Loved the design and being able to walk freely around the cloud. In a city that bustles along this was very peaceful.
,,Beautiful Reprieve from Stifling Singapore Humidity,5.0,,What a lovely well-planned rainforest garden - complete with waterfall. It's a great way to spend a morning or afternoon with family and or friends. Thank you Singapore!
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,It was gorgeous inside. It was so nice to walk around and just enjoy the greenery and the views. It was slightly pricey for tourists however
,,Impressive and recommended,5.0,,"If you dislike the humid outdoor weather but want to be surrounded by lush greenery, then look no further. This dome is much more impressive than the flower dome. Beautiful, amazing and been 4 times already. Every visitor I've taken were godsmacked. Just go!"
,,Simply very well done,5.0,,"Even if you are not into plants, this well worth a visit. The artificial waterfall is nothing to write home about, but the variety of plants is magnificent. Can feel chilly though, and the Flower dome (combined ticket mandatory for non residents) is even colder. They have magnificent plants and trees there too (the Baobabs are fantastic) but lunar new year deco looked plain cheesy."
,,Breathtaking.,5.0,,"This is a must see attraction in Singapore. Visually staggering it assaults all your senses, the shear scale and imagination taken to construct the Sci-Fi trees, and the plants and flowers waterfalls springs is staggering."
,,"Worth visiting, unique concept",5.0,,Its an excellent concept with uniqueness. All in all a great experience. Very well planned and worth visiting for nature lovers.
,,amazing,5.0,,"If you are garden lover you must see. Large tall walls of greenery and orchids. Beautiful lit waterfall, a truelly amazing place. Cost a bit to get in , I think it was $28 singapore dollars each , but well worth it.They have elevators for those that have illness/injury or are elderly to get to each level. I also loved watching the video on screen about the weather patterns changing and global warming. Will go back here if we ever come to Singapore again. A MUST SEE ATTRACTION"
,,Cloud Forest Experience,5.0,,What a wonderful time I'm not a lover of plants but the waterfall experience you get once you walk in took my breath away
,,Well Worth the Time and Money,5.0,,"The entire conservatory is spectacular - the flowers are gorgeous, the indoor waterfall outstanding and the general sense of peace refreshing. this is a place you should see at a leisurely pace and bring your camera."
,,ok,3.0,,Worth a visit but not that great as the flower dome. It has a big waterfall which is man made and they have lots of plants growing around it. The best thing is it feels cool temperature wise so when visiting in the afternoon it feels good.
,,Felt really on Clouds,5.0,,This was briliant.. it has reentry option. They mark a stamp for reentry. Nice to see the waterfall. it was soothing...
,,Expensive but nice,4.0,,Beautiful Orchids. Clean and great views. We spent about 3-4hrs. Can visit once. Food is pricey. Well planned. Beautiful architecture.
,,beautiful,5.0,,waterfall is very amazing and beautiful. the place is very cold so be sure to bring a jacket.visit at night was nice to see the decoration lights
,,Love it!,5.0,,So worth the price! I went to see the flower some too and I loved that one too. Completely air conditioned and super comfortable and beautiful.
,,par excellence,5.0,,"If u are fond of flowers and plants , you could not be at a better place. Even if u are not , it still is an excellent place to be at . A comparatively new attraction in Singapore, It is built on 7 different levels. It shows plants and flowers from all over the world. Depending on the height at which the flowers are found in the world, they are placed on appropriate levels in this cloud forest. The top most level( lost world) is the best as it shows flowers and plant found at the highest altitudes and includes plants like carnivorous plants , pouch plants amongst others."
,,Wonderful variety of plants,5.0,,"Very cool and the skywalk was amazing. The walk around was misty, the waterfalls fantastic. There are so many plants to look at. You wonder how they can plant such huge trees."
,,Must go when in Singapore,5.0,,"The abundance of flowers is amazing and the truly high waterfall makes great impression. I did not see the clouds(Was early morning) but the visit in the cloud forest still made my day. Book your ticket with transfer from your hotel this is a real pleasure. Then, on the way back home, you can visit Sentosa, which is in neighbourhood, mall etc.

There is a large parking in the front of conservatiories. You can also buy some food and drinks and some souvenirs, which prices are lower than at the airport (but not that much lower ;))"
,,Excellent with waterfall,5.0,,"Really enjoyable waterfall and rare plants like Nepenthis,and easily walkable,lifts are there for senior citizens"
,,Its ok,3.0,,"Liked it more than the Flower dome, but still not very impressive. With limited time in Singapore, there are definitely better alternatives to the cloud forest. Not really worth paying for this"
,,Very nice,5.0,,"For indoor forest, this is amazing, the waterfalls, the plants, the trail. For a father that introducing his 6yo son the nature, I was very happy."
,,Thought I was in Costa Rico,5.0,,"Peaceful,Realistic combination of Technology and nature to present a unique nature experience. Combined with the Gardens by the Sea ,a great way to spend the day!"
,,It is a unique creation even beyond imagination.,4.0,,"It is just unbelievable, you will enjoy every moment while you are there. Dont have enough words to describe it. It is all created by engineers designers, and botanists. Maintenance is fool proof. healthy and strong can take stairs to go up, while weak and infirm can take lifts to go up."
,,"Ok, but nothing special",3.0,,"It was just Ok, nothing special compared to real rainforest. Some very long queues on elevators. Expected more, but when in Singapore its a must"
,,A Forest You Must Explore,5.0,,The decoration is very good. Interesting mist from the waterfall. The walkway to explore each floor is amazing. It's good that there are the lift for senior.
,,Boring..,2.0,,"Boring, nothing much to see, a poor version of Flower Dome. It was wet and damp from the waterfall. I thought it was a waste of money."
,,a sight to see,5.0,,"ranked highly for a reason.
Great to walk in to the cool from the heat outside.
You see the waterfall straight away - a sight to behold - amazing that it is indoors.
A slow walk upwards, with a marvelous selection of plants to look at, from tiny orchids to vary large bromeliads - massive array of colour.
We were considering a look at the botanic gardens, but didn't feel the need once we had visited here.
Definitely worth the money."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Loved everything in the cloud forest. Don't rush through the forest. There is plenty to look at and admire.
,,Sublime and Serene,4.0,,Being enveloped by misty rainforests was a beautiful relaxing experience. Beautifully crafted experiences. Cloud walk was the highlight.
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the most interesting attractions we have been to around the world. Imagine visiting an actual cloud forest in a high altitude jungle like setting planted with various exotic plants and orchids. An imposing waterfall greets the visitor upon entry. The temperature is controlled, actually very cool by Singapore standards so it was very pleasant. Recommended to bring a jacket or shawl. One must go all the way up to the 7th level and walk around a sort of canopy walkway to appreciate the surroundings. If one has a fear of heights though, this is not recommended to do. All in all, not to be missed attraction in Singapore. Can be visited together with the Flower Dome which is just situated across. Spent around 2-3 hours here."
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,"This has the Wow factor as soon as you walk through the entrance. The water fall is just amazing, together with the cool forest air it will take your breath away. The entrance is on the upper floor and the exit at ground level. I had a ticket for the flower garden too, and made the mistake of walking all around to get back inside! Just remember to go up the escalator. The walk down from the 7th storey is amazing and shouldn't induce too much vertigo. The planting is inspirational and the flowers burst with colour. Remember to look out side through the windows the view is amazing. A must see."
,,Day time visit- a beautiful escape from the scorching sun.,5.0,,"By the time we reached here- it was post noon and the sun was scorching. suddenly when you enter inside, the temperature would dip to 25 degrees! The waterfall is the first sight that you see and the fine spray in the air is so welcoming. There is such a beautiful set of flora here, that you are transformed into a different land. Kudos to the team who conceptualized and executed this marvellous attraction!"
,,Great view,4.0,,Nice to follow this after the flower dome. Once you are exhausted and you enter cloud forest it seems like heaven.
,,Plan to spend an hour or so in peaceful beauty,5.0,,"There aren't many clouds, but this is a great attraction nonetheless. It's well laid out and there are loads of beautiful plants etc. Great way to spend an hour!"
,,Just One word - Heavenly!,5.0,,Must visit place in Singapore. The place is so heavenly. Thank you Gardens by the Bay for this wonderful creation! Would love to visit again and again! Thank you:)
,,A beautiful indoor forest experience,5.0,,"Well worth the time to explore the Cloud Forest. The climb up to the top with the pool, the crystals, water falls and variety of plants are all amazing. Well worth the time."
,,A LITTLE PIECE OF PARADISE,4.0,,"This is the 2nd time I have been to visit, the 1st when it was just oped to the public a few Years ago.
When you walk in though the mist of the large water you are immediatley cooled from the sticky humid heat that is Singapore, you then wind your way up (or get the lift to the cloud walk with all the greenery and flowers.wend your way down via escalators or lift to the screening of how climate change can effect the planet if we do not change our ways, very interesting.then non the ground floor to see the various types of rocks, minerals and their various formations.
The huge waterfall flowers and plants make this a worthwhile experience."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"A very nice attraction. Lots of plants, trees and flowers and a real cloud forest inside an architectural beauty."
,,A fabulous sight during the evening,5.0,,This is a must see when visiting Singapore. It can take an hour to travel from top to bottom. The view is spectacular.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Wonderful concept - planned out and maintained very well. A must - see attraction especially for the children. The waterfalls, the rain forests , the entire theme is brilliant. Need sufficient time to really enjoy the place."
,,Good access,5.0,,Brilliant with good wheelchair access. Variety of plants - amazing. Friendly staff in shop and visit worth the money.
,,Quick browse around,4.0,,If you like flowers it is a nice short visit. Having said that the charges will seem like it is not value for money though.
,,Leave This One For The Night,4.0,,When visiting Gardens By The Bay in the morning buy your tickets for the Cloud Forest and The Flower Dome go and look through the Flower Dome but when you exit have your wrist stamped so as to let you return in the night. Have another look through the flower dome with all the lights on then go to the Cloud Forest it is much nicer at night. If you do not have the time to return twice it is still worth a look at any time.
,,"A fabulous , refreshing place to visit",5.0,,I loved the waterfall and the living wall in the Cloud forest. It is great that there is a lift so that those who are physically challenged can still enjoy the fabulous plants at all levels. The variety of plants is just amazing. It is definitely well worth the visit.
,,Cloud forest visit January 2015,5.0,,"Pretty remarkable place, interesting and impressive! The view from the top is beautiful, and made for a fun and refreshing (also nice and cool!) stop."
,,Cloud forest love,5.0,,"This place is so unique and special to Singapore. I loved walking through the different paths and levels of this forest. We took our little one in a stroller and it was very easy to manoeuvre around. Even when there were stairs, there were also lifts nearby. It was such a refreshing experience and I would highly recommend for all the family."
,,Good one,5.0,,Much better than flower dome. The waterfall in the middle is beautiful. Also multi-storeys and levels make it interesting.
,,Exciting,5.0,,"The first glimpse of water fall is a surprise. You go up by lift, and then walking down by sky walk is thrilling and beautiful. very nice flora and fauna."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Well done architecture and exhibits! A relaxing time in a cool and refreshing conservatory. Good variety of plants and nice a/c.
,,Quite remarkable,4.0,,"Cloud forest, especially on a hot Singapore day, is something special. It is a well done, very interesting and informative look at (the actual) place that most of us will never have a chance to visit. It is lovely and peaceful. Worth the admission fee."
,,A must see.,5.0,,"As an ex pat living here I often have friend sand family visit, and this is one of the sites I will always recommend or take them to visit.
Only in Singapore do you walk into an amazing engineering structure that houses a cloud forest. The cool waterfall is a fantastic greeting from the humidity outside and the flowers and plants throughout are just incredible.
Well worth a visit."
,,Wow!!,5.0,,What an amazing place! From the moment you enter the dome this place has you gasping in wonder. It is imaginative and educational as well as beautiful and a joy to visit!
,,Loved this,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay, this was our favourite dome with the huge waterfall and wonderful wall planting and high level walkway."
,,fantastic place,5.0,,The harmony of natuel and art!! Wonderful! My son is really enjoy the Cloud Forest. It's a best place in Gardens by the Bay.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was a must see. It was like being in another world. Highly recommend it. If you can only do one, deffinitely do this one, not the Flower dome next to it."
,,Pleasant afternoon,4.0,,Even my adult sons enjoyed the walk around Gardens By The Bay. Cool oasis from the heat and an interesting trip through the rainforest type exhibit. Impressed by the environmental messages.
,,Amazing falls,4.0,,The great water fall surprised me! The skywalk is awesome!! I lIke it so much. I would recommend friends to visit.
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,Well worth the admission price. The cloud walkway above the canopy is spectacular. The plants are beautiful and the waterfall looks amazing.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The cloud forest was really amazing, especially on a hot and muggy day. Never seen anything like it. Its a must see."
,,Most impressive attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest offers some respite from the heat of Singapore. Immediately upon entering the dome you get the full ""wow factor"" of a water fall and wall of green. Well stocked from a botanical perspective, the cloud forest (and sister flower dome) are also architectural wonders. Best visited mid-week to avoid the local crowds."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"When you first enter the dome, you are greeted by a refreshing spray of water from the enormous indoor waterfall that scales the height of the dome. There is a huge plantation of montane vegetation surrounding the ""mountain"" and waterfall and we found many of the plants to be quite exotic. The route begins from the base and then an elevator takes you straight to the ""Lost World"" at the top where you gradually spiral down the mountain face on escalators to the bottom. On each level, there is usually an elevated walkway with a clear floor that takes you outside of the mountain providing breathtaking views of the mountain. There are also interesting information stations that describe the forest environment inside the dome. At the bottom, there are presentations that warn of the impacts of climate change and other environmental issues. Overall, the Cloud Forest is provides a spectacular display of plant-life, but also double as an informative centre for environmental discovery and conservation advice. It may seem a bit pricey when you purchase the tickets, but combined with the Flower Dome, the fee is a little bit better for value. Just be careful not to get your camera wet!"
,,Sky Forest in the Mid Asia,5.0,,"Cloud forest, I'd rather call it sky forest ;) why? It was so cold!!! But cold in a good kind of way ;) the attractions from the entrance to the landscapes to the designs and structures, the whole concept of the cloud forest is phenomenal ;) even though it was cold, I advice don't bring a sweater or jacket or else you will not feel how's it like to be in a cloud garden. Good thing I'm not that scared with heights ;) I love the whole concept of the place and because of that I'll definitely visit the place on my next visit to Singapore! Thanks!"
,,Amazing Waterfall,5.0,,The waterfall was far beyond my expecation. You can stand almost below it and feel the water coming down.
,,Loved It,5.0,,"Make sure you visit this dome when at Gardens by the Bay. On entry you are greeted by a magnificent waterfall, the rest awaits you..."
,,Spetacular,4.0,,"I was expecting something good, but the whole experience was just way beyond my expectation! The scale of the fall and the massive plantation are simply spectacular. My daughter loved it so that she had to walk it through twice though her little feet were already tired. ^_^"
,,fantastic idea,5.0,,"The concept is so well done that any person that likes an Eden type project will be blown away with this, it is better on all counts. We were there over the forthcoming Christmas period & we were not expecting the excitement that was in the air."
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a stunningly beautiful place and a testament to the ingenuity of its designers and creators. The waterfall is amazing and we were awed by the beautiful ferns and orchids which grow so profusely. The views from the top of the mountain of the Marina Bay Area are also impressive. This is a cool and tranquil place to visit, especially after a day in the hot and busy city."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"We arrived in the early evening to watch the beautiful light show in the giant trees sculpture. Then walked down to the cloud forest to go inside. The staff were still selling tickets but fortunately when asked what flowers we would be able to see, advised that we would not be able to see the flowers very clearly as it was quite dark inside and by-the-way, you only have half an hour to go through. So we asked for our money back. What is the point of selling tickets to go through a display at nighttime if the visitors cannot see that display because it is too dark! We were going by the opening times on the information brochure. If we ever return to Singapore for a holiday, we would definitely go back to have a look during the day."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,It is truly amazing. A modern marvel that you have to see. The building and creativity of the designers is just amazing.
,,Beautiful,3.0,,"It was beautiful, unfortunately we were unable to go up on the walk as there had been sightings of lighting in the distance."
,,Do it if you have the time,4.0,,It's beautiful no doubt but I would say don't keep these garden s as priority both the cloud and flower dome . Luckily we had the time and you'll get done amazing photos and experience fake mist created to give the cloud effect . The gardens by the bay are also lovely but botanical garden s are no1 .
,,A must visit place,5.0,,Worth the cost and time. The structure including the waterfall is just mind blowing. The waterfall is amazing. Don't miss it.
,,"Waterfall, flowers and nice view",5.0,,"Interesting architecture, an indoor waterfall, lost world path. You can use elevator or walk. Incredible view of Marina Bay Sands and Gardens. Worth to visit and enjoy plants, orchids and the waterfall built."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,This was something unexpected and great. Worth seeing. We only went to this not the adjoining flower centre as we were going to the botanical gardens.
,,Walk among the clouds,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is set in one of the domes at Gardens by the Bay. The Dome provides an opportunity to see the plants of various rain forest environments from around the world. The Dome has a man made mountain in the middle and as you ascend on the walkways are able to experience plants from around the world. The waterfalls and streams add to the feel of being a world away. The arrays of orchids and other plants are clearly labelled and there are notes on the environments they have come from. The facility caters for all people with an emphasis on provision of lifts and paths to allow wheelchair access. The clear walkway allows the visitor to look down through the floor at the expanse of the dome and watch the water falling down the side and the plants, as well as gaining a view to the Marina Bay Sands, the tree forest and walkway as well as across the bay. Allow several hours to just take time and explore all the levels, read the information provided and spout the smaller yet amazing flowers on display."
,,"Cool place, too much propaganda",4.0,,"This was a cool space (literally cool too). There was a bit too much propaganda for global warming though (actually, it was everywhere)."
,,"Beautiful, unexpectedly breathtaking.",5.0,,The facility is very well maintained and organised. Toilets are not available on every floor but not too much of an inconvenience.
,,Interesting,5.0,,this is really impressive the building itself was very interesting and all the plants and the work they have done inside is really worth a look
,,worth it,4.0,,"Compared to the other dome, which we saw first, this one was really worth it! The design and concept was really interesting and there was a lot to see. Waterfall, stalagmites and stalactites...etc. We spent a lot more time at this dome and enjoyed it a lot more."
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"Nothing new if you have already visited the Orchid Garden and the Botanical garden except for the Anthuriums, but the way the things have been kept is mind blowing. A Visit here is a must."
,,cloud forest,5.0,,This is a fantastic place so well done easy to get around and see everything loved this a must see it is quite high at top so may not be good for people who do not like heights
,,Nothing much exciting,2.0,,This place is good for nature lovers. I did not find this place much interesting. There are plantations around with fog all around and all you have to do is climb till the 6th floor to watch out for different varieties of plants.
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,The simulation of a cloud Forrest is excellent in this beautiful building. The plants especially the orchids are worth the visit alone
,,Not to be missed.,5.0,,A must do on your list of attractions when visiting Singapore. A great way to spend a few hours in this fantastic garden.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"These large Pods are really distinctive and interesting. The gardens are superb, but the raised walkway is what most people want to experience. Go to the restaurant at the top of the largest pod, you can just have a drink or ideally book an evening meal. Well worth a visit day or night.
You have to pay to go up but worth it."
,,Take Time out for this place. You can't miss it!,5.0,,"Make sure you visit the Cloud Forest before you leave Singapore. When you enter Gardens by The Bay, make sure this is your first destination. As you enter you are welcome by an artificial waterfall against some beautiful flowers and flora of sorts growing on a vertical planter. It is actually a huge mountain that they have created and have planted plants, climbers and flowers vertically on that. There are 7 Levels and every level has a theme.

The best way to do it is to take the elevator and reach the topmost level and climb down via escalators. The concept is something unheard of. Very evident that Singapore is aware of nature and its importance and is not just hatching eggs with that knowledge. They are actually applying this knowledge and trying to make people aware. The entire garden works on the law of sustainable energy and this they have mentioned in their documentary at Level 3 (called +5 degrees) where they are portraying earth in 2060 - The way earth will become 5 degrees hotter. This sounds just 5 degrees but will bring about extinction of flora and mainly fauna. How islands will be flooded and how we will lose it all. It is a nice documentary which also shows you how things can be worked out. There are solutions. The way voice over goes with 'you can do it too LIKE US' sounds promising.

You can't miss it."
,,Real cloud forest,5.0,,"Its a feeling one is in the real rain forests of the amazon. They simulate clouds, there is a good waterfall. This place has the wow factor as this was the 1st place we visited in Singapore. Must visit place in Singapore."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Excellent and very good value at $35 for the two domes (Including Cloud Forest) and the Sky Walk. TIP visit late afternoon and do the domes in daylight, get your re-entry stamp on your arm at exit then visit at night after your evening skywalk. Toilets available - bit of an outdoor feel to them!"
,,The best place in Singapore,5.0,,Cloud Forest in the gardens by the bay is the best place to visit. I loved it. Its very very cool and special attraction to visit and probably spend more than an hour. The view is amazing as well.
,,Very Impressive,5.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect so was pleasantly surprised with this structure. The design is excellent, you feel like you are walking through a waterfall and then through a rain forest. So many different plants and shrubs - all very interesting. It was quite cool so worthwhile wearing long sleeves or bring a light jacket."
,,Cool Experience (literally!),4.0,,Definitely a must do if you're headed to Gardens by the Bay. Exotic plants in a futuristic structure makes you feel like you're walking around in a large scale terrarium!
,,"Do not miss it, otherwise Singapore visit is half...!",5.0,,"Cloud Forest is just 20 minutes drive from Lavender street and close by the Marina Sands Hotel. The best exterior view one can get is from Singapore Flyer. It is an amazing place to visit, a kinda dreamland."
,,Sufficiently happy.,4.0,,The concept is really good. The array of flora is great. A large variety of orchids and rhododendrons and a number of species I have seen before. Very reasonabley priced therefore I would recommend a vist.
,,Special place,5.0,,"Loved this place which is deceptively big. Well worth the 15$. It was also a nice respite from the heat as it's actually quite chilly inside. Just loved the waterfall and all the plants and flowers, even my boyfriend appreciated it and generally that's not his thing"
,,Amazing sight,5.0,,Seeing a huge man made waterfall inside a cooled building took our breaths away!! The care and imagination with which this place has been built and is maintained is an example for others to follow
,,Takes your breath away,5.0,,"I found the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome breath taking, the layout of plants in the flower dome were just beautiful and the towered structure inside the Cloud Forest was amazing. Both Domes are fairly cold so take a cardigan, and take you time to walk all over and enjoy the experience. Tickets are fairly expensive but worth it."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A great way to spend a day, if you like gardens this will delight you, every corner is just wonderful"
,,Very Cool,4.0,,"Worth seeing, if you have time. Make sure you stay for the light show in the gardens in the evening."
,,Amazing! A must do!,2.0,,"This experience is simply amazing. There are not enough words to describe the magnitude and beUty of both the domes. Money well spent. My only quibble - as is the case in lots of places in Singapore, the souvenirs are very expensive."
,,A Man Made Mountain,4.0,,"Cloud Forest is really a typical Singaporean. They don't have a mountain, then they make one. It looks so majestic, and knowing these are made by men but all of the plants are real. The room is really mild and comfortable, as if you're really in a mountain and hiking without actually hike :p (there's a lift and bridge for that) and at the end of your journey in Cloud Forest, they showed us a very moving documentary that would make you care about our own nature. definitely worth a visit."
,,A fantastic world apart in the city,5.0,,"It is very impressive when you first get into the dome to have this huge waterfall, as if it was real. The exotic, tropical plants are so luxurious."
,,An amazing waterfall structure,3.0,,"This structure houses a large waterfall, and you can climb up the structure and walk along canopy style walkways.

The plants established on the structure are quite amazing to view.

The structure itself is large, imposing and unfriendly. With the exception of the walkways, its no better than walking around a car park.

I was shocked and horrified to see displays of cave structures which have been taken from the wild. The destruction of natural caves for the purpose of this display is simply appalling. Its disappointing to see such disregard for the natural environment as evidenced by this cave display.

There is a climate change display in the basement which is overwhelming and claustrophobic. Its ironic to consider the environmental costs of constructing this venue in comparison with this display.

Overall, this venue is amazing and impressive, but the experience is largely artificial due to the imposing unfriendly nature of the structure. The tickets to enter are quite expensive. Show your recent SIA boarding pass to receive a discount."
,,Great imagination,5.0,,"Inside a huge dome, the man-made cloud forest was a nice surprise when we visiting the Gardens by the bay because it has rain-falls, falling plants, high passage-ways, ponds, etc, all design by man."
,,Very Creative great educational tool,4.0,,"This is a very intriguing creatively designed venue. I really enjoyed it. It has been very cleverly designed. It is also a great educational tool about mankind and our environment. Great options also for people with disability.

Tip - make sure you bring a good camera, selfie stick, extra camera battery, and take your time"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"A good place to visit after walking around outside. The place is cooling. Giant waterfall inside, interesting place just to walk around."
,,just gorgeous!,5.0,,"This gorgeous place brings joy to all visitors, me included. you can see it on every visitor's face. The beautiful design of the structure, the excellent selection of flora and fauna, the cool climate all make this a very worthwhile experience at a reasonable price."
,,It's a Rainforest...Inside of a Building!,5.0,,You're probably going to have the Gardens by the Bay on your list of things to do - including Cloud Forest is a must! It gets you out of the sun and heat for a bit and it is so cool! Quite impressive structure and ecosystem inside of a greenhouse-like structure.
,,Interesting concept,4.0,,Not as interesting if you have trekked in real rain forest environments. Some great plantings. Get in early to avoid bus loads.
,,A cool building with all kinds of plants,4.0,,"This is nice excursion on a hot and humid day in Singapore. The tall building has a spiral walkway that goes up through the different tempered zones. And along the way you can read and learn about all kinds of plants. Next door is an equally large building with focus on trees and flowers that is not as exciting but still worth a visit. One might wonder how much energy that is required to cool this two enormous buildings... Nevertheless, the experience as a visitor is great!"
,,not as great as expected,2.0,,"I expected more, but didn't find it that great. It's man made and maybe a bit too much for my taste. Some may like it, but I rather have something more real, wild and authentic, when I want to admire nature; not this man made garden that has metal and plastic everywhere behind it's parts of green."
,,Just wow!,5.0,,"After a bit of a disappointment experienced in the Flower Dome, this conservatory was just wow! Wonderfully designed green hill with many layers filled with walkways from inside, some really high up above, gorgeous waterfall and ponds and remarkable interactive presentation inside storeys. Great experience, lovely flowers and thought that has been put into this conservatory make it a unique and exciting experience."
,,Great place to be..,5.0,,"Great place to spend sometime and enjoy the walkways and the tropical forest. Of course, the mist is chilling and such a relief in the hot and humid climate of Singapore."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"Loved this place, fully air conditioned and well set out, spent about 2 hours here with a 13 and 15 year old, who enjoyed it as well."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"This place is truly amazing. I had read other reviews before we visited but it was so much better than I was expecting. The waterfall is spectacular, and the plants and water features are awesome. There are walkways in the clouds and opportunities to stand behind the waterfall. I went with my teenage children and we all really, really enjoyed it. It really is a must do experience."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"What an amazing construction/attraction. We could spend half a day in that calming, relaxed environment. Something for visitors of all ages. So well maintained & run!"
,,Head in the clouds with plants and waterfall,5.0,,"As close to the real thing with all the plant varieties in one place, easy walks and lifts available."
,,Manmade chilled climate.. !!,4.0,,Cloud forest is certainly a good attraction. It is beautiful example of manmade chilled climate.Singapore does not have Foggy/Chilled weather/Waterfalls. Cloud forest is the place where you can get it. Must see place at least once.
,,Amazing and Unique,5.0,,Clever and unique way to experience and learn about the secrets of the tropical forests. The waterfall and walkways are stunning.
,,Awe inspiring,5.0,,Much better then I expected from the description. We took the lift up and spent an amazing time walking down the mountain. The art and sculpture with the plantings were just amazing.
,,It was like a difficult maze,3.0,,"We went there with senior citizen parents and 7 year old son. The artificial waterfall at the entry is nice. There are various types of plants to see for those who are interested. The parents found the place a bit cold. So from 3rd floor we took a lift to the 6th floor and reached the 7th floor using stairs. We thought we would make parents wait at the 3rd floor while we would see the 4th, 5th, 6th floor by walking around. However, there was no way to return to the main area from 7th floor. It was like a very difficult maze to get return to the main area. In fact we failed to reach the main area from 5th and 3rd, 2nd and 1st floors. Eventually, we came out without really completing our visit. Of course, re-entry stamps are available at the exit and you can re-enter without repaying fees. However, we were physically and mentally exhausted from the efforts of trying to reach the main area. We were also glad that we did not separate from each other within the dome. it would be a nightmare to search for a person if you get separated. So a couple of advice: 1) Carry some warm clothes for elderly and kids. 2) Stay in a group together and don't plan to meet up later. It may not be possible to return the same point easily. 3) The place may not be suitable for those with breathing problems."
,,Awesome,5.0,,The cloud forest was great. Really glad we went and experienced it. Lots of high level walkways and mist.
,,Could get really cold in here,4.0,,"Having gone inside both conservatories, I would say I prefer Cloud Forest to Flower Dome. To me it was unique and has more sensory appeal.

Upon entrance to the conservatory we were immediately cold and wet, thanks to the mist (more like drizzle) of the falls. The Cloud Mountain, with its man-made waterfalls, dense foliage and suspended walkways, was a refreshing sight. We rode the elevator to the top level and explored the different zones until we reached the bottom once again.

The waterfall view deck on the 4th level is a good spot for a photo op without getting wet. Well, not as wet as when you pose on the bottom of the falls right by the entrance doors.

If you are easily chilled, do bring a light sweater as both conservatories are kept between 23C-25C, sometimes lower. Considering outdoor humidex was in the high 30s and we were dressed for summer, the cold and wet was a bit of a jolt."
,,Should cover if visiting Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Its a nice overview of how waterfalls, mountains get created , with very nice views of SG skyline from the top .
Just a word of caution : It can be really cold inside so do not hesistate carrying a light warm jacket if you find it hard tolerating cold weather for an hour or till the time you are inside."
,,amazing plants,5.0,,bring jacket or coat to go inside. there is a waterfall inside. water splashing and cool breeze. the rain forest plants is just amazing.
,,Worth paying for!,5.0,,I visited Gardens by the Bay and decided to pay for a ticket to the Cloud Forest. It was beautiful and a great way to escape the humid conditions outside. There were so many unusual plants and a man made waterfall! Different species were planted according to the altitude where they live. There is disabled access and at the visitor centre wheelchairs can be hired if you are unable to walk around the large enclosures.
,,A Walk in the Clouds,4.0,,"As part of the Sands amazing complex, this is a Pavilion that has challenged the designers to give visitors the feel of the tropical forest at all levels. It was beautifully designed, with lots of orchids and all kinds of other tropical flowers, it is lit at night and has an artificial yet imposing waterfall that welcomes you from the entrance. The air is very humid inside, to allow growth of the all the creeper vegetation. There is a nice view from the top and along the entire ""walk in the clouds."" This is a nice place for flower and nature lovers, educational for the kids."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This is what SIngapore is all about; modern, well designed, clean. This is a real treat, really interesting and a perfect respite from the heat of the day"
,,Very cool,5.0,,I really loved the cloud forest. I haven't ever seen anything like it. Plants are pretty and the views through the windows are fantastic.
,,CLOUD FOREST - A MUST SEE,5.0,,"It was a great experience whether you are a plant lover or not. If the weather is mild (it was December when we visited), have a light jacket ready as it can become rather chilly. Be prepared to be sprayed with a light mist of water from the stunning waterfall and the misting for the plants. I can imagine it will be very pleasant even on hot summer days.

We took the lift all the way to the 6th level and walked up to the top level. It was an outstanding experience with the variety of plants at their natural elevation habitats. My little son had a great time looking at the Venus Flytrap and my elder daughter had a good time photographing the plants and flowers.

We visited during the day light hours and was advised that there is a light show in the Gardens at 730 pm and 830 pm of the Supergrove Trees outside the Cloud Forest. You might want to time the visit to see the Flower Garden and Cloud Forest during daylight and catch the light show at night. There are lots of food choices at the area.

Very easy to reach by taxi as well and there is a shutle to take you to the nearest MRT station as well. Buy your tickets online so there will be no need to queue when you get to the venue."
,,Nice place to cool of and see flowers,4.0,,"This exhibitions was really nice distraction from walking in hot outdoors and all the shopping. Beautiful colorful flowers under huge glass dome, winding pathways and some cool, humid air. Very refreshing."
,,Wonderful!!!,5.0,,Must visit attraction while in Singapore!! Start the trip by an elevator to top floor and then decend through a walk way to lower floors!! The falls at the entrance is beautiful!!
,,Quite a feat of construction,4.0,,"Unique conservatory featuring a self creating rain forest environment with many plants and trees , visit the rain cloud in the roof and walk amongst the waterfalls"
,,Nature in Air Conditioned Environment,5.0,,"Many different varieties of plants grown around a ""mountain"" with a cascading waterfall. It was beautiful and very pleasant to walk in since it's air conditioned. There's a lift to different levels of the ""mountain"" for those who needs it.

We paid an entrance fee to include the Flower Garden as well which was next to this and it was beautiful there as well."
,,Nice climate,4.0,,If you like to walk around beautiful flowers and gardening you will find this worth a visit. We were surprised that it was cool compared to the heat outside. We almost didn't go in because we thought it would be too hot.
,,Nature everywhere,5.0,,"It was a great experience walking through this place. You can really feel n sense you are right in the middle of the mountainous highlands n jungle, more like a National Park. The air is so refreshing, sounds of the great waterfalls. Personally I think the best time to walk through this place is at sunset. The sights of lights outside the place and inside was fantastic. The climb n walk up the stairs to the top was adventurous, too. Nature n Ecology shows were just great, very informative. Learning to love n appreciate nature more. Feeling refreshed."
,,extraordinary,5.0,,"One word: amazing. I'm not a plant lover but here is something stunning. Everything looks like from the future. Those who are afraid of cold, take a jacket."
,,Go during day light only.,3.0,,"Visited twice once for an office charity event and once with family. The office trip was during day light hours and the cloud forest looked it's best. Its cool and lovely though do be prepared to get sprayed by a fine mist of water.
With family we spent more time at the flower dome and eating in the gardens and visited the cloud forest at 8pm only to find that it's barely lit up! It was dark and dreary and we couldn't see much. My son got quite upset navigating the slippery bridges in the dim light and we felt this was a huge waste of the entrance fee and a shame. This should either be closed at sunset or better lit.
Do look out for pitcher plants though.
The stalagmite / stalactite exhibit and trivia at the exit levels is interesting. As is the ceiling mirror for selfie on your way out.
All in all our 8pm visit was a waste and we will not go again."
,,So so,3.0,,"Loved the details provided about the ecological effects, botany and nature in the cloud forest. The lost world was lost on me. The ""pipe""/thingamajig where the waterfall began could have been covered with foliage for it to look more natural. Some of the vegetation/ foliage left me with a ""huh?"" With that said, they did an amazing job and it's a once in a lifetime visit. My grown children loved it."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Its like we were in the movie AVATAR! Amazing structure! We were not expecting to have jaw dropping experience in a ""forest"" but we were in for a big surprise! Well done Singapore!"
,,Magical greenery & eco message,5.0,,"Fantastic journey through micro climate of a cloud forest presented in a large climate controlled glass dome. The spectacular indoor waterfall is the starting point of this journey through the cloud forest. Wonderfully cool (air conditioned, climate controlled for the plants) you ascend through the different levels of the forest up to the secret garden at the apex. Many beautiful plants, from orchids to conifers and succulents. Also a very good crystal cave display. A great experience and welcome respite in warm weather! We loved it."
,,Pretty cool man-made structure,4.0,,"I would say go to the cloud forest instead of the flower dome! I find it more exciting and interesting. Its really cold in there too, which caught me by surprise. Probably 15 degrees or so. The structure is massive, with waterfalls and walking bridges. There's plenty to learn as you make your way up too - each level has a purpose/theme. Do it!"
,,Up in the clouds,2.0,,Dont be fooled by the name. You are not up in the clouds where the climate is much cooler or cold that you experience nature at a cooler climate and high attitude. What I love most was the man made high waterfall. That was the only picture perfect moment to take while getting sprayed with water.
,,Wow. Indoor waterfall.,5.0,,The different climates on a mountain are explained as you make your way to the top of this amazing man made and environmentally friendly structure. Making environmental education exciting and understandable.
,,Air condidioning at full blast!,5.0,,"This is a very ambitious project, creating a huge cold weather environment for high altitude plant life here near the equator. And it has worked.

Inside the Cloud Forest you will be met by a cold and misty atmosphere typical of low mountain environments, populated by alpine and exotic plants. In addition to the flora, there is a display of rocks, crystals and stalactites.

The place is organised in layers, representing different altitudes, and the best way to do this is to take the lift to the top, and walk down the elevated walkways and escalators.

If you are not good at heights, you may wish to bypass some of the walk ways. If you have children, you may wish to keep a close eye on them (although the walkways are safe, climbing onto the handrails is a BAD idea).

Not to be missed."
,,Cold and Damp,4.0,,"Visited this after going through the Flower Dome, where we were cooled to below comfortable. The Cloud Forest felt even colder and with the spray and mist that is an essential part of the experience, we sort of hurried our way through this exhibition. I'd suggest taking a jacket unless you are from a cold winter climate and can stand the damp, cold air."
,,A forest in the clouds,4.0,,"If you have fear of heights you should probably not enter this dome as the pathway you will walk on in the ""clouds"" are kind of see-through and it is a long way down. If you dare and try anyways it is a very nice experience, with the waterfall and the way the mini forest is build around the dome. The flower dome was a better visit and since there is not much of a difference in price between paying for one or for both, choose both."
,,A Must See,5.0,,Certainly gets you thinking about our finely balanced planet and how the smallest disruptions can have great long term consequences.
,,Unique place,4.0,,"Liked - variety of plants, flora Be warned that you might get wet from water falls Can be quite crowded particularly during the holidays We went on December 25"
,,Part of the experience when visiting the Gardens by the Bay at the same time,5.0,,"Great experience and very informative, never seen anything like it before you should go and see it for yourself, was happy to have taken our Mums there to experience it."
,,An excellent visit,5.0,,Brilliantly conceived & executed with great attention to detail. Such a varied amount of flora in a small place is a great credit to the designers and execution team of this project.
,,Bored within 5 minutes,3.0,,"My wife and I went to see this on our recent 4 night stay in Singapore. We decided to choose between Cloud Forest and the other dome with all the flowers. Chose Cloud Forest as we thought it would be more of an attraction and have more of a 'Wow' Factor about it.

Upon entering, it is very impressive. However there is not much else to see in there apart from going up on the platforms around the structure itself which was not our cup of tea. In hingsight the flower dome would have been the much better option as they had a whole christmas theme on show which would have been nice to see.

The temperature inside the Cloud Dome is also very cool and very damp which really affected my sinuses as when we left the attraction I quickly developed a cold for the next two days.

My advice would be to either see the Flower Dome instead or pay the price for seeing both attractions."
,,"Not so fantastic, just a big garden",3.0,,"I went to Cloud Forest after Flower Dome area, I found this bigger than Flower Dome. First, you would find the waterfall area, it was very beautiful but the wind and the weather was so cold.
Then you would go up and up to the next area, but there was nothing good maybe because it was night and everything was so dark.
I recommended you to bring jacket and go there in the afternoon because you can see beautiful flowers brightly. I was regret going there on 5.00 PM until night, nothing comes on my camera because it was so dark."
,,Amazing,5.0,,What an experience. Cloud forest was amazing. Got the best seats in the house for the christmas light shows and was not disappointed!
,,Nice different setting of garden,5.0,,"once you enter the garden, big waterfall welcome you and get ready for the water splash over there. Due to the climate control, the garden is fogging, this create a different excitement, but dont expect to take a picture here, since the picture will be blured. A whole new different interesting garden to see nature."
,,Tired from Christmas,3.0,,Great and fascinating site. Blooms were exhausted from Christmas and lacked attention. Flowers were not worth seeing clouds were great.
,,Average Botanical Garden in an Amazing Structure,3.0,,"We only had a bit of time to spend, so we decided to focus our time on the cloud forest as it seemed the most unusual of all the attractions at Gardens by the Bay. The entrance fee was around $18.00 which I guess seemed average, but for what you get it might be a tad overpriced.

The Cloud Forest is essentially a massive five story tower covered in waterfalls and plants which has a few exhibits at its center. You take an elevator to the top and work your way down, traversing some impressive pathways. One cool sight is to see workers repelling down the sides of the botanical mountain in order to work on the plants.

It's not that I think you should skip the Cloud Forest - its impressive for the wild structure and being inside it's massive dome and walking the elevated paths. But from a botanical garden standpoint it's incredibly below average with no unusual plants. Perhaps that's why the other dome exists next door. So if you have the time and are at Gardens by the Bay anyways, be sure to pop in."
,,Beautiful flowers in remarkable setting,5.0,,Spectacular colour and variation of flowers on display. Well worth the visit and take your camera to take some glorious close ups.
,,Fantastic attraction,5.0,,"Amazing experience. Have to pinch yourself to remind that you are still in tropical Singapore. Loved it, great exhibit, well laid out."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"I found it a bit odd that there would be a rain forest dome in a tropical country, but I was blown away by how well done and engaging this was, as well as a blessed cool release from the heat of Singapore.

This is a fantastic engineering achievement as well as a great Eco exhibit. Recommended for individuals and families alike."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"Mind-boggling is really the only way to describe the Cloud Forest. I have traveled quite a bit and can truly call this site unique. I could not stop taking pictures of all the incredible flowers that make up this mountain of beauty. Take your time so that you don't miss anything, and whatever you do in Singapore, don't miss this!!"
,,Breathtaking!,4.0,,"This is a must stop for all travelers in Singapore. We were initially on the fence about visiting, however after exploring the Flower Dome we simply could not leave without exploring the Cloud Forest Dome as well. A must stop for any families or nature enthusiasts."
,,"idyllic, invigorating, indomitable",4.0,,"As the name suggests, it is like walking into and upon a cloud... through mysterious mist, magnificent waterfall, lush greens - it's a sight for all the senses!
And if the forest inside seems like fantasy, this sheer endeavour to strive for ecological balance is definitely not : the Cloud Forest drives home the message to respect nature!
If the entry fee is a bit daunting at 28 bucks, well, there are few other experiences as ethereal as this one... standing atop the misty walkway, amid the most amazing flora and fauna, you have to be here to believe this!
Remember, for that price, you also get to stroll through the Flower Dome and look up at the SuperTrees:)

Tough to believe, man really made this forest."
,,very cool,5.0,,This is not your average rain-forest aboretum. It is done up on a huge scale. Very beautiful. Very impressive. Worth the admission fee.
,,Lived up to Expectations.,5.0,,"Once you pass through the doors of the Cloud Forest, you are greeted by a beautiful man-made waterfall and the bridge which circles around it. The flora that surrounds it is so lush and vibrant. The low temperature of the dome makes this attraction a must do if your in need of escaping Singapore's humid climate."
,,Something out of a fairytale,5.0,,"When in Singapore you have to visit this extraordinary place. As soon as you enter cloud forest you feel as though you have been transported to a place out of a fairy tale the architecture is incredible but still makes the place seem natural. You will enjoy a beautiful your starting from the top and weaving down through pathways and bridges moving at your own pace there are a lot of people but somehow it never seems crowded.

It really is so beautiful !"
,,gardens by the bay,5.0,,You don't have to be a garden lover to enjoy the experience - it is truly amazing what they have done here.
,,Must see!,5.0,,It took a while for us to get there. We weren't sure what to expect. But as we stepped in the waterfall took my breath away! I didn't want to leave. The way it was set up was just superb. I could star there all day!
,,Interesting and Exciting,5.0,,"The first issue is getting there. We walked through the passageway from the MRT station at the Marina Bay Sands which is air conditioned. After coming up to the street level, the Gardens by the Bay shuttle service is in sight. This is well worth the $2 fee and includes a ride back. You don't want to spend too much time walking in the heat.

The Cloud Forest is the more interesting half of the Gardens. It consists of a large artificial mountain and waterfall. The idea is to go to the top and work your way down. There are fantastic views and a little thrill when you look so far down. The exhibits are well marked and informative.

The exit is through an extensive and tasteful gift shop. I was sorry I had already done my souvenier shopping."
,,Far too cold,3.0,,"I didn't last long in here - it's freezing. The exhibits are okay, but I couldn't enjoy them as the climate was not very enjoyable at all, I couldn't wait to get out again."
,,Wonderful - see in the middle of the day,5.0,,"See the review for Gardens by the Bay as well. This is a terrific attraction just when the heat and humidity of outdoors Singapore seems too much to bear. Great visit! Also, the Christmas decorations added to the sight. Cool off, watch, enjoy the waterfalls."
,,Amazing and beautiful,5.0,,"Every traveller should visit the cloud forest, it is an amazing structure and beautiful to walk through, not to mention a lovely escape from the heat of Singapore. The pricing was reasonable, we visited during the day, but I would like to return for a night visit."
,,Unique place to visit,5.0,,"Take the MRT and get off at Bayfront station. From the station, walk through Marina Bay Sand shopping mall towards Garden by the Bay. Takes about 10 mins. Inside the enclosed glass dome is a man made mountain with giant water fall. You get to see a huge range of flora from different part of the world. Inside temperature is well maintained, very cool and comfortable. Take the lift to the top floor and walk down at your leisure, take photos as you go. Good place to spend a few hours and get some relief from the hot / humid Singaporean weather."
,,Ugly concrete tower,1.0,,"Like the Gardens by the Bay I didn't get the point of this place. It is an ugly concrete tower which tries to mimic the impression of jungle or something alike. The waterfall is a bad joke and the mix of plants doesn't make any sense. I went there in the evening and it was extremely cold inside.

If you ever went to a jungle-like forest in Southeast Asia, don't bother."
,,Lovely,4.0,,With the Christmas decorations the place looked lovely. So many species of trees in one place and that too indoor. It was a wonderful experience.
,,Absolutely a must see,4.0,,"As you enter the cloud dome you will be pleasantly surprised by a beautiful man-made waterfall.
It is very chilly in the dome, so be sure to pack in a jacket or extra clothing to keep you warm.

We decided to purchase tickets for the Cloud forest only and not the flower dome which was a very wise decision. The kids would of been bored having to look at flowers. The cloud forest was exciting for them because of the ramps that led us down to the ground.

There are spectacular photo opportunities of the city and this is really a must-see if you are in Singapore."
,,A fantastic few hours in the Clouds,5.0,,"Probably the best of all the attractions in the Botanical Garden a stunning Mountain with Waterfalls and Mist and easy to visit for Children, disabled and elderly. One needs to allow around 2 hours for this fantastic Cloud Forest visit"
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"I was actually surprised at how well presented and laid out the cloud forest is. As you enter you walk in to the base of an artificial mountain and waterfall, which is covered with flora and fauna. You travel to the top via elevators after which your experience really starts as you walk down around the man made mountain to see the flora and fauna up close.

It can get quite chilly in the cloud dome so I would take light jacket if you are not used to the cold."
,,"Green, very green",4.0,,"It is an interesting structure, shaped as a mountain covered by plants, and an artificial cascade pouring at one side. The interior is formed by floors, each one with a different ambiance. A walkway allows a ride out of the mountain, where you can enjoy the wide variety of plants that recovers it."
,,Interesting and different,4.0,,Quite a strange place but some interesting displays and fantastic views. Try to pick a dry sunny day.
,,"Very well designed, with great attention to detail.",5.0,,"Cloud forest is one of the best places to visit in Singapore.
It is inside Gardens by the bay.....in an enclosed glass dome. The cloud forest has a huge man made mountain with a high artificial waterfall....the mountain is covered with flora from different parts of the world. The temperature and humidity conditions inside the dome are maintained as there in the evergreen forests.
The mountain has a high ramp where one can take a walk and experience the flora up close.
Well designed, with a lot of attention to detail, very interactive displays.
Clean toilets. Must must visit."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This amazing work is definately worth a visit. Although i'm not an avid plant lover, the whole indoor dome and how they have managed to put in a waterfall and made an environment suitable for all types of plants is a pretty mean feat.
It can get chilly though so I was glad I had a jacket with me."
,,"What can i say, experience is better than words",5.0,,"Beautiful scenery. Cool place. Cold air. Rare plants. Giant waterfall. Been here for many times still love the place. Especially when it in rainy season, adds extra cool conditions."
,,Nice for kids,3.0,,It was very interesting for kids but not too much to do for adults. The artificial water fall was impressive
,,Lovely Experience for Nature Lovers,5.0,,This is part of the Marina Bay Gardens area and is an undercover rainforest with lots of flowers and plants.It's very informative about eco systems. It is a welcoming change to the heat of Singapore.
,,Nice for a rainy day,5.0,,"It's covered and air-conditioned and located near the Marina Bay Hotel in the park. We were there on the weekend so it was fairly busy.
When you walk in you'll see a giant water fall after that you'll go in an elevator and circle down to the bottom with spectacular view of the surroundings."
,,Sensational,5.0,,"Great place to visit as part of a trip to the gardens, wow factor as you enter the exhibit Loved it, it's a great vision executed really well. Go early in the morning to miss the crowds"
,,"Cool, literally, experience and site to see",5.0,,"Interesting and well designed indoor rain forest with tumbling waterfall, flowers and kinds of plant life. Nice to visit if at Gardens by the Bay and get out of the heat of Singapore!"
,,thrilling,5.0,,The wonder of the waterfall and the walk down through the eco-systems was awesome and damp and slightly scary all at the same time.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely loved this experience. A welcomed relief from the Singapore midday heat, definitely worth a visit. Did not expect it to be as magnificent as it was, impressively tall and a massive variety of plants. My partner and I are not usually plant lovers but loved this."
,,out of this world,4.0,,"After having seen a documentary about how the construction companies compiled the entire complex, had to pay a visit to this place.

The wonder starts the moment you enter the automatic doors. Instant climate change! serenity and a quiet peace..... Apart from the waterfall. The walks are not short, something you would expect since it is al built under a dome. You can spend hours here and see something new. Don't forget to get a stamp, so you can get back in again.
If you travel with children , also visit the garden for the children. It is great fun. Difficult to leave."
,,visit during Xmas week,5.0,,"Ensure you wear a jacket, some areas are challenging cold. The variety of plants and shrubs are good. Lots of learning of family. Good to go early during the day.. worth for nature lovers.."
,,Nice experience for Nature lovers,4.0,,very well planned and beautiful experience of a rainforest the falls at the entrance is nice you might get wet near the falls and its very cool inside which might make u feel cold though out the walk
,,Awesome,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the beautiful waterfall and different vegetation. it's very calming. however, I felt quite cold as I walked nearby waterfall and so did my 2 years old nephew. it might be a good idea to include in the brochure that children might need jacket"
,,Amazing...,5.0,,"I hadn't done much reading on the Gardens by the Bay and was not sure of what to expect. The ticket price was pretty high considering that at the end of the day this was just a botanical garden. The flower dome while nice, did not really make me feel that I had got value for money... all this changed the moment I walked in to the Cloud Forest dome... this just blew me away. The huge waterfall at the entrance, the walkways winding it's way down from the top was a very different experience and this was certainly not a run of the mill garden. Will certainly do this again if only to experience the Cloud Forest."
,,Excellent,4.0,,Enjoyed my time in the Cloud Forest. Cloud walk is not for anyone scared of heights. Interesting concept.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"Well worth the visit! We visited both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. The Cloud Forest was very well set out, makes it very easy to walk through and find yourself taking lots of photos. A little cool inside, glad I had a jacket."
,,"Cool experience, fairly small",4.0,,"We did this just before heading off to the airport to leave. We stretched it to abut an hour. Recommended experience, although I don't think I would go twice. I was more interested in the space and experience than the plants, which didn't really grab my attention - possibly because we were mindful of time.

Tip - consider bringing an extra top or scarf, it feels quite cold coming into the dome and we saw a lot of people wearing jackets and scarves and were jealous! You do acclimatise after a while though."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Oh this one was really good, it's almost like you were in a movie. The design was fantastic! The walkway was the best. Make sure you get to the top floor directly and go from there."
,,Bucket list must do,5.0,,"Absolutely blown away by not only the sheer beauty of this place and the gardens, but also the engineering marvel, both structurally and climate. Simply a must see!"
,,Futuristic amazement,5.0,,"This dome, is a manmade wonder. Some might dispute, because everything is artificially done etc. But if that doesnt bother you, and you are easily amazed, then you will just love this. The place feels unreal on the inside, it was like being in a video game universe set in future or something. Simply amazing, a must see."
,,A wonderful experience.,5.0,,"Truly a spectacular build. Visiting the Cloud Forest was definitely the highlight of our tour of Gardens by the Bay. It is a beautiful attraction in more ways than we could have even begun to imagine. Not only are the flora and fauna a pretty sight, they are flourishing. If we ever tour Singapore again, the Cloud Forest is one of the places we would be most likely to visit again."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is one of the most amazing gardens I have seen. From the waterfall to the mountain of flowers it is truly amazing. The walkway takes you high up and you stroll past so many beautiful orchids and plants on your descent. Don't miss it
,,fantastic place,5.0,,"This is one of the most unreal places I have been- a great combination of nature and technology, which really fits Singapore. It was lovely and refreshing"
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"This place is definately worth a visit.
This place is air conditioned and covered so this definately saves you from outside humidity and rains :)
The place has some great views with a walkway around the hill to come down.
There is a beautiful waterfall which definately mesmerized us.."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"It was a manmade wonder, the way the flora across species have been maintained and the man made waterfall is quite a sight to see, a particularly enjoyable phase is walking down like the skywalk.."
,,"Wow, what a unique experience",5.0,,"just something that you can't describe. An artificial rainforest essentially, where you can work your way down from the top, with a huge waterfall right in the middle that you can get inside of. Loved every minute of it."
,,Stunning tropical gardens,4.0,,A gushing waterfall is the main setting for this outstanding display of tropical trees and plants. There must be 100's of different orchids and following the winding walkway brings the visitor up close to the lovely plants and is a delight for the keen photographer. The Cloud Dome also provides spectacular views over Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay complex.
,,Lovely and Cool,4.0,,The Cloud Forrest is an amazing forest complex encased in a huge glass house. It is a wonderful cool relief from Singapore's humidity. We visited at night when the light is kept very low. If you are interested in looking at the plants then visit during the day when you have better light. The atmosphere at night is great and it was still a good time to visit.
,,Ultimate Place,4.0,,Viewing the place is opportunity to grab when you are in Singapore. Its a garden developed in a dome. really appreciable place made by Singapore people.
,,never miss this if you are in singapore,5.0,,"worth to visit, it will be a wonderful experience while you reach on top. Need to spend minimum 3 to 4 hours if you really want to enjoy."
,,Cool educational experience,4.0,,"A great eye opening experience that is educational, with a breath of fresh and cooling surroundings."
,,A great experience,4.0,,"The cloud forest located at The Gardens by the Bay is truly a must visit place for anyone. As you enter the place, one is astounded by the breathtaking sight of the magnificent man-made waterfall. The cool breeze is so soothing. As you reach the top of the waterfall, the experience is fab. Take a walk on the tree top walk and you will be mesmerised."
,,Chill Cloud n Forest,4.0,,Awesome place located at garden by the bay. Forest created in the cloud shape with chill n fog and waterfalls created inside. walk upside down and feel like on a hilly chill mountain sorrounded by million of natural flowers. Nice place to hang out n one of a kind..
,,Awesome Place to see,5.0,,I went there in the evening. Beautiful plants & trees to watch are there. Iliked that place very much.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,A must go for your trip in Singapore! The entrance fee is worth every cent. In the presence of such nature; one can forget he/she is still within a city.
,,Worth to Explore,4.0,,"One of the best attractions in singapore. It is inside Garden by the Bay. They had this big made up forest inside a dome. And there's a huge waterfall there. It's very cloud inside, about 5 degrees cold, i recommend you to bring jacket. I...More"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The giant waterfall was spectacular. Go to the top and walk down the path to experience the different species of flora. Take your time, there is lots to see."
,,It is complete artificially developed,3.0,,"Visit this place at the end of your singapore trip. The feel is good , Architecturally very good but its not outstanding. I dint find it interesting. Something which is very much artificial with high power Airconditioning to create cloud like effect and atmosphere!!"
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,awesome structures and amazing built. Lots of beautiful plants and trees. Wonderful Christmas decorations.
,,Impressive,4.0,,"They've built a really clever little simulation of a natural wonder here, and it's gotta be the easiest way to immerse yourself in the environment of a cloud forest, with all the plants, and (man-made) clouds. Pretty cool."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"This was by far my favorite thing in Singapore. Everything here was displayed beautifully and there was so much to see inside the building. Right after you walk into the building, you are awe struck by the indoor water fall and everything else was very...More"
,,A great garden experience,5.0,,"Beautiful constructed gardens. Amazing feel to the place. Plants , water features and areas are well kept and worth spending a few hours ."
,,Educational,5.0,,"The exhibit talks matter-of-factly about climate change. In the US, this would be considered controversial! Singapore has some great architectural wonders. This is one of them."
,,Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area,5.0,,Spectacular indoor garden with a wonderful selection of tropical plants & flowers & the hifghest indoor waterfall in thw world.
,,"Fabulous, cool moist mountain air when outside 35C and dry",5.0,,"As the prime minister of Singapore said the waterfall is 'awsome'. The cool moist air feels fantastic after walking in from the hot out side. The falls are I believe the highest indoor waterfall in the world and they are spectacular. Make sure you see them at night also the lighting is wonderful. Moving down from the top of the 'mountain' down across the suspened walk ways down to the secret garden is a calming and beautiful experience. Along the way you can gain knowledge by reading some of the many information boards.
I cannot review the Cloud Forest without writting about the planting. The mountain is clad in plants many many orchids and other moist cool air lovely plants. The trees are maturing and reaching the suspended walk ways. These have all been placed in a 'natural' setting to mimic how they should be seen in the wild. It can only get better and better. Always be curious as there are secret corners to delight.
It is also an ECO house as the cooling is carried out by recylcing plant debris gathered from the city and the super trees outside are infact the cooling towers for the whole system."
,,👍👍👍,5.0,,"Pretty cool considering its built on the ""little red dot"". Pretty proud of my country for building this. Have visited a few times and the vast flora and fauna and structures never fails to amaze me. Must visit!!!"
,,moving in clouds,4.0,,very well planned and it gives the a feeling of travelling in clouds in some forest. be creful while entering otherwise you are likely to get wet.
,,Simply WOW,5.0,,One the best attractions I have ever seen. I would advice that you take enough time to enjoy and appreciate the Cloud forest. there was nothing to dislike. The was a good food oultet and icecream parlour outside.
,,"Incredible, avatar-like experience.",4.0,,"The Cloud Forest was a great attraction to visit. It was very full on, and quite adventurous. I enjoyed climbing the railings and getting an incredible view of the city and the dome itself, but the complete lack of wildlife was a little underwhelming. All flora, no fauna! I just think it would have added to the experience."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Well maintained and like the experience of man made structures similar to nature.The falls were a sight so was the travel made comfortable for my mother who was tired of walking across the location.Even wheelchair is possible in cloud forest steel slopes.
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay ... well worth a visit,5.0,,"I have visited this attraction a number of times so obviously you don't absorb everything in a single visit. Secondly, it is simply a lovely and breathe taking place to spend a Sunday (or any other day) afternoon. As mentioned in other reviews the waterfall is simply amazing and because of the technology used you soon forget you are in Singapore but rather you are transported to depths of some rainforest.
It can get cool in the facility so you might want to carry a sweater or light jacket. Another attraction well worth a visit if you are in Singapore."
,,Two domes,4.0,,Of the 2 hedgehog domes the cloud is the most impressive and unless visitors have time a plenty just the Cloud Forest is recommended.
,,Exciting experience,4.0,,"The indoor waterfall is really amazing
Is really nice and cool when we get inside the cloud forest, and soon it become freezing. We haven't take any jacket so we leave within one hour because is too cold. Remember to bring a jacket when you visit cloud forest as the temperature drop quite a lot when compare with the weather outside.

It is well presented and you really feel like you went to a rain forest, however it is quite scary when we walk out the top walk."
,,Cool climate,5.0,,Just a spectacular building and a clever engineering feat. A must see part of the gardens by the bay. The waterfall is so cool and the range of plants and trees is staggering. We especially enjoyed the old olive trees.
,,Nice Place to Cool Off,4.0,,"Cloud Forest may underwhelm those who are plant-fanatics, I expected more of an arboretum experience; i.e., a great number of plant species. However most were begonia, fern and impatiens varieties. The exhibit includes good, educational interpretive displays. Otherwise the Cloud Forest offers nice outward views and is a nice place to cool off from the heat and humidity. This is a good attraction for families."
,,Stunning,5.0,,On a hot or rainy day this is a haven . A very well laid out and informative venue. Highly recommended
,,"Nice and cool, beautiful",5.0,,"I only had time for one of the exhibits in GBTB so did the Cloud forest. Loved it. Flowers, tropical plants, etc all in the cool mist environment which was a real treat to skip the heat outside. Towering waterfall is in the center and you're able to walk all the way up in the circle and down this mountain side replica. I really enjoyed the totem type statues throughout too, artwork."
,,Waterfall,4.0,,The indoor waterfall at night can get really amazing... the water sparkles and the colour is lovely!
,,after the flower dome,3.0,,Freezing cold in here but i did enjoy the mist in the air experience. flower dome was more scenic though.
,,never before!,5.0,,"This is amazing.... not only was it 'rescued' from the sea but the building's engineering alone is worth seeing, not to mention the planting and design... go down to the basement afterwards to see the threat posed by Global warming"
,,Beautiful - simply beautiful,5.0,,"Had no idea what to expect. The structure for this exhibit is unique. The plants are healthy, blooming, wonderful. The exhibits about the earth - educational are not to be missed. What our planet could look like in 100 years is well presented. I only wish you could purchase in the gift shop some of the videos used."
,,Must Visit Forest,4.0,,"As you enter, you'll be amazed by the world's tallest indoor waterfall and a 35-metre tall mountain covered in abundant vegetation. It shows plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000-metres above sea level.

There are different levels where you can appreciate the unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests. 

From top to bottom, you have the following attractions:

Secret Garden - if you start from the top, you will end your journey here at the foot of the mountain. It is a chasm that will bring you closer to plants that were once abundant on earth, but are increasingly rare today. 

+5 Degrees - This is where they show you a mini AVP about the effects of temperature increase in the planet. This virtual experience allows you to see the world from a different perspective.

Earth Check - This is a place of facts, figures and statistics of the state of the earth today and the threats that we will have to face due to climate change.

Tree Top Walk - the walk that will take you closer to the forest

Crystal Mountain - this part we just walk over and left not because it's not interesting but because the Philippines has a lot of this amazing caves in Sagada, Cagayan, Palawan and Bohol and I have seen the real stalactites and stalagmites up close so I'm kinda bias. But there's a lot to learn here about geology, continents formation, earth's age, and the importance of fossils in understanding our planet’s past.

Waterfall View - This is where you see the grand waterfall. Steep and a little slippery because of the water droppings so be careful. If you're like me who is slightly afraid of the heights then a minute would suffice.

The Cavern - Another walkway where you can learn life forms of cloud forests around the world.

Cloud Walk - Up close view of the other side of the mountain.

Lost World - This is the highest point of cloud forest. They say it replicates the cloud forest vegetation at around 2,000m above sea level. This is where you can also enjoy fantastic views of the Marina Bay waterfront. 

We enjoyed this a lot. I am slightly afraid of heights but it helped that the walkway bridge and suspension looked very safe and strong. I hope so. The cool-moist conservatory helped us enjoy the place more."
,,Cool and educational,5.0,,"Very nice conservatories - we totally underestimated the time we will spend there therefore didn't finish the sky walk. The varieties and beauties will make you linger in one place longer than expected. We both love plants and flowers so it's easily a place we can spend 4-5 hours. Again, short taxi ride from city center."
,,Nice and cooling,5.0,,"Singapore is hot all year round. The cloud forest (and flower dome) is a good place to step into to hide away from the heat, and still be able to enjoy the sunlight.

At certain times of the day, the cloud forest is covered in mists, so be sure to plan your visit in accordance to the mist timings."
,,Nice and cool place,4.0,,"The garden, Flyover and bay allin one location so easy to do these in one day....plenty of walking to do."
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,Maybe this will improve with time but I was disappointed that the servicing was clearly visible when looking up from ground level. Still plenty of great plants to see but not as good as I was expecting.
,,Awsome place,5.0,,The cloud forest is the second tomb in gardens by the bay the temperature is low in the tomb there is a arificial water fall due to which rainbow also occurs and then the main thing walk on cloud the feeling was veey good feels like we are in clouds with bit of water droplets. Amazing and chillish feeling fantanstic
,,Must do with Kids,5.0,,Places that can be covered around along with this in a single day. Merlion. Marina Bay Gardens & Supertrees. Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. once done take a cab or walk it out to the Singapore Flyer...
,,Forest in the Garden,4.0,,One lung of the Gardens by the bay. Ten year old addition to the Garden City. Visualised by Grant Associates. Made a reality by the revamping city of Singapore . The Fall flowing from the Lost World greets you to climb up the afforestation inside the doom on the seashore. Elevated walkways take you to the top with multi surprises on different floors. Something not to miss .
,,Creative Copy,5.0,,"You'll think that you've seen it all even after the Flower Dome, which is at the end of the trail. I won't give away to much so you can experience what I experience. The Clould forest Dome was the highlight for me. Absolutely breathtaking from the time you walk into sliding doors its a WOW factor. You are greeted by an indoor waterfall that comes from the very top spraying a light mist at your face. The exotic flora and fauna were unique and beautiful, everything was alive the air was fresh and crisp you could smell every fragrance. Follow the trail to the top cause it is mind boggling, you won't know which way to look. This dome is a photographers paradise even for the novice you'll want to take fotos. The arrangement and choices of flora and fauna was impeccable. Give yourself time to wander through this Rain Forest dome it is beautiful, I can still hear the waterfall. WOW must see."
,,Breathtaking experience,5.0,,What an amazing concept and architecture. It is very relaxing and fresh. It's a bit chilly so bring extra layer of clothing.
,,definitely a MUST...MUST... DO,5.0,,"everyone has said it all before but we six adult family thoroughly enjoyed this ..and yes it is.... a visual, contemplative and ""time out"" experience... including the domes... go on pay to see them...you will not regret it!!!"
,,Great Man Made Rainforest,5.0,,Lovely Rain forest inside the Gardens by the Bay The many floors to the top give you a terrific feel of the forest at all levels.
,,High Indoor Waterfall,4.0,,"It is amazing indoor waterfall. Feeling cool when get in. If you go not in hottest month, bring a light clothes. A walk on the bridge on the top, you will feel terrible when look down to floor. But it is safe. Dont worry!"
,,Relaxing,4.0,,Was quite impressed even though I am not a garden or plant lover. Went with my wife and kids and we all took pictures in front of the 30 meter waterfall and had a great time exploring through the caves etc. Entire walk through takes about an hour or two depending on your level of interest. Would recommend for sure...neat to see and not to expensive.
,,Cool day spent,4.0,,"It was a good journey to check this area out. I'd recommend coming, especially if you have children! Fun environment, well worth your time."
,,Impressive but should not be preachy,4.0,,"Gardens by the Bay try to recreate something Singapore does not have: highlands! Kudos for the ambitious, novel and creative idea.
The execution is quite good too, as fine mists are sprayed at certain times to simulate the misty environs of a highland. Quite fun.
The grille walkway is also a clever move, It created a sense of vertigo which substituted for the lack of actual height. It's almost like looking down a glass floor!
What is a turnoff is how the information on display tend to be preachy and holier-than-thou, about how other countries should be more responsible with their rainforests. We get it, but considering that Singapore does not have any nor is it actively working to preserve rainforests elsewhere, it seems a little preachy, condescending."
,,A must at Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,"This is one of the two enclosed domes we visited at Gardens by the Bay. A beautiful array of plants, ferns and trees!"
,,A quick getaway from the city,4.0,,"Best to go in the afternoon, for photography addicts a lot of subjects to take from. The waterfall will welcome you when you get in. The bridge was very pretty cool too."
,,well worth a look,4.0,,"a really good day out for the whole family, beautiful orchids and a water fall you can walk inside.overall good value."
,,A wonderful mix of nature and architecture,4.0,,As I entered the structure I felt like I was in a sci-fi movie featuring a man-made garden of Eden inside a futuristic dome. The glass and metal matrix was a very interesting balance to the huge forest formations.
,,See it,5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the Bay but you pay to go in and it really is worth it. I am sure it will be different again on our next visit.
,,My favourite tourist spot in Singapore,5.0,,"Spent a wonderful afternoon here enjoying the beauty, coolness and variety of plants. There are 2 domes. The cloud forest dome and another dome. The other dome had a beautiful Christmas scene and lovely festive music."
,,So cool!,5.0,,"We went twice, once during the day and once at night. They give you one free re-entry on the way out so it didn't cost anything extra.

The place was awesome. We really enjoyed the huge waterfall, all the flowers and the lazy walk around the place. We very much recommend it!"
,,An expereince worth having,5.0,,"I've been to Singapore so many times, but this was the first time I've been to the Gardens. What an amazing expereince. I won't go into an essay describing my visit, rather just say pay a visit yourself, I guarentee it will be like nothing you've done before."
,,Part of Bay View Gardens,4.0,,Good attraction with a walkway up into the ceiling of the dome. It is another level of the Bay View Gardens. Apparently meant to be good at night when it s lit up.
,,Atmospheric,4.0,,We visited in the evening and really enjoyed exploring the Cloud Forest. The waterfall is beautiful and the flora and fauna too.
,,Stunning and a wonderful experience,5.0,,"The whole set up for this cloud forest dome in the Marina Bay Gardens is unbelievable. Full climate control for the plants within allow cool climate mountain trees and shrubs to flourish at the top, while at the bottom, warmer climate plants and trees survive.

The elevators take you to the top of the dome and a series of ramps and walkways intermingled with downwards escalators deliver you to the bottom while you enjoy the 'natural' surroundings.

Informative and interesting.

Excelllent."
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,Only Singapore could design this amazing attraction. We really enjoyed our visit and the description of the plants was impressive.
,,Urban Forest,5.0,,"I like the experience of walking in an air-conditioned forest. I felt there is room for improvement in parts of the interior architectural design within the ""mountain""."
,,Escape the heat,4.0,,"This is one of my favourite 'new age' attractions in Singapore no just because you can escape the afternoon but when confronted by a huge waterfall near the entrance is really something! There is moist foliage everywhere it is an enjoyable 1 hour visit. Reminds of Cameron Highlands in the 80s.

There could be a queue for tickets so if you come on the weekend, try to be early or buy online if possible."
,,A Major Highlight,5.0,,"The fresh air, creativity, lush vegetation, all culminate into a wonderful visual experience!!!!! I wandered around in awe. It was quite a lot of walking that day. Remember to bring water with you, but it will be a day to remember."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Excellent design,feel like walking in a science fiction movie.We bought the ticket for 2 gardens,Gardens by the bay was average,not value for money."
,,extraordinary,5.0,,"Architecturally, botanically and historically interesting...be aware of what is outside the cloud forest dome and sense how it all relates withwhat is inside. Don't miss it."
,,Adjacent to Flower dome. Enjoyable atmosphere,4.0,,"I visited this only once during my stay in Singapore for over an year.
A remarkable effort in maintaining trees and plants that normally grow 000s of feet above sea level. So many hundreds of plants that include some unique ferns, plants like utricularia and so on. A huge waterfall (artificial) adds drama to the whole experience. Breezy atmosphere (much needed in SG weather). Lovely view of Marina bay sands from the top floor.
While it is a great attempt to maintain such a diversified eco system, it had to be pointed out that the ticket price is not so cheap. Well one could argue that it would cost a lot to maintain such a natural habitat but I personally feel they went wrong by displaying thos giant grasshoppers in the man made pond outside the domes which are too ordinary. Instead they could have brought in some more variety. Coupled with the flower dome, this place is a very good attraction and a lovely visit. But people who have hiked up mountains & have been to national parks in many of the asian countries might feel the set up too artificial."
,,The greatest thing I ve ever seen in my life!,5.0,,I had never seen or dreamed anyone could ever create a tropical forest in a dome! Simply BREATHTAKING
,,Love the nature!,5.0,,Love the walk around the cloud forest. Been here twice and the place is so cool and filled with greenery. The waterfall is awesome and the surrounding is peaceful.
,,A special experience in Singapore,5.0,,"While the entire concept of Gardens by the Bay is unique and a must visit, the Cloud Forest for me was something special because it felt like one was transported to another world. Went there with a friend who was visiting Singapore and must say it was a wonderful experience for all of us."
,,cool,4.0,,for nature lovers. a side-trip to one of these 2 domes will cool you down when you're walking along marina bay sands
,,Lovely,4.0,,"Lovely, but if you are sensitive to cold, you should bring a cardigan or a jumper, as the airconditioning is turned up to the max.
It is actually quite lovely to be able to walk down from the top, but the bridge didn't seem as sturdy as I would've liked it to be, and if you aren't fond of heights, it won't be for you. That doesn't mean you can still explore though."
,,Beautiful creation,4.0,,"The cloud walk was breath taking, the lost world at the top is serene, the waterfall is awesomely conceptualized. The best part of this place is the earth center and he AV that runs giving us some eye opening information about conservation of Earth."
,,Its Cool,4.0,,Its really Cool and cool. Beautiful tall water fall. walking near it at the end of the fall is a really nice feeling.
,,"ok, strictly",3.0,,its strictly ok. again having a steep ticket and highly commercial. this place is a man made forest with a variety of plants from different parts of the world. but if you have been an avid traveller you can better give it a miss.
,,Flowers in the clouds,5.0,,"This is one of the domes at the lavish Gardens by the sea complex
The flowers are stunning! The carnivorous plants like Pitcher plants, Venus fly traps etc are especially interesting
You need to be able to walk a few km but you go up by lift and the scenery is such that you don't notice the distance. If you have a serious problem with heights this may not be the outing for you.
Don't go without a camera and make sure that you have plenty of battery and disc space.
The cost for an adult was$S 14"
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,The Cloud Forest blows you away for both the engineering feat and the natural marvels in the dome. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Most enjoyable if you visit in evening,3.0,,The Cloud forest is really so beautiful. We visited at evening closing hours... So we were in an hurry
,,If You Can Only Choose One...,5.0,,"If time constraints force you to choose between the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome or the Botanic Garden's Orchid Garden, by all means, choose the Cloud Forest! Even if one is not interested in flowers and plants, the sheer structure and planning makes this worth a visit. We saw the same variety of beautiful orchids as we did at the Orchid Garden and were much more comfortable inside the cooled Cloud Forest than sweating in the sun at the Botanic Gardens. Even though the Flower Dome has the word ""flower"", when we visited there were no flowers to speak of, so the Cloud Forest made up for that. We would have been sorry to have missed the chance to visit the Cloud Forest."
,,Great place to experience high-mountain-like forest just in town,4.0,,"Incredible creation of mountain-like forest again by Singaporeans. Anyway, if you are the genuine mountain hiker, you might feel so-so for this one."
,,Great Visit,5.0,,"I'm not sure why this is separated from Gardens by the Bay, since it's really all 1 attraction. However, this is the best part of it. The entire area is air conditioned, so it's nice and cool and a great escape from the hot humidity outside. The waterfall is fairly impressive, and the ramps that extend beyond the main pillar in the middle are great to walk along, even for someone afraid of heights like myself. The ""hidden garden"" down the bottom is not so hidden, and as long as you don't exit early, the path from the top down will take you directly through it."
,,Fabulous dome,5.0,,My favourite dome with the man made waterfall with all the fauna and lush. Felt so therapeutic to walk the walkway and admiring the scenery. The plants and fauna were all well taken of. wonderful place to visit.
,,Great experience,5.0,,Awesome! One gets a real feeling of blending with nature. Only Singapore create this kind of experience.
,,Great Waterfall,5.0,,"outstanding! the Cloud Forest has 7 floor if i'm remember correctly, it was superbly design and construct. a little cool inside but its great to escape from outside heat, really a place to visit, worth it."
,,Cloud Forest must see,5.0,,"Its Eco it spectacular, talk about the hanging gardens of Babylon, this would be better, go see it, its worth the money and effort."
,,One Of A Kind!,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore, and are in the Gardens by The Bay, you must go and see the Cloud Forest!! Inside a giant glasshouse, they have built a mountain with a huge waterfall that keeps everything misty and damp, just like being on a mountain top in the jungle! Great viewing platforms all around the mountain, plenty of displays and a myriad of vegetation types that represent this climatic zone. We would put this in the top 5 things to see and do while visiting this wonderful city. It is in the GBTB complex, but you can access this attraction from the nearby street as well, so you don't have to walk all the way across the gardens to get there."
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,"A man made tropical mountain full of plants and waterfalls, this great attraction within the garden by the sea is well worth the visit.
Just past the man made waterfall a lift takes you up to the 6th floor then you walk up the last set of steps. If you have a disability you can get access up the last floor.
Walking down the ramps is easy and there are plenty of places to stop for photos, rests or to enjoy the views."
,,Very exotic exhibitions and offers ac and shield from the sun,5.0,,"The waterfall inside is astonishing, it has 4-5 floors of exhibitions and offers a very nice elevated view of the Marina Bay despite it being the lone paid admission inside the Gardens by the Bay. Do note that its distance from the main entrance is slightly far (~15-20 mins walk in the heat with no ac) so make sure u r hydrated and have uv protection before beginning the exploration."
,,Beyond Explanation,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is one part of the Gardens By Bay-Bay South.,Singapore.This is the latest addition to the tourist spots of Singapore.It is must see place in Singapore.Explaning the attraction is not that easy.One should spend atleast two hours to feel the joy.One must carry Camera to capture very good moments.Cloud forest inaddition to Flower gardens are the major attractions in Gardens by Bay.Visitors to Singaore must go there to get thrill."
,,So oool and moist - definitely is an escape from the hot city,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a man made forest with a 35 meter tall mountain densely covered with plants, orchids, fern .... Right at the main entrance, there is a very tall waterfall. You can actually feel the water splashing towards you. That made a very cool and moist weather like in the highland.
Just take a life to go up the mountain and walk down via the walkway. The cloud walk is very nice and comfortable. On top of the walkway, you can enjoying the greenery view of the mountain, and of course the aerial view of the surrounding area. Down the mountain exploring the lost world.

If you do not want to hide in the shopping complex from the heat of Singapore weather, clod forest is definitely a better choice."
,,OK but expensive,3.0,,"This is OK, very expensive. I would not go back, I would only walk in the gardens outside. It does not take long to visit the Cloud Forest."
,,Rainy day,5.0,,"Awesome, incredible, beautiful. An experience to walk up between the trees was closed for security reasons. It was a rainy morning, the walk has no roof, and the walk might have been slippery."
,,Very nice,5.0,,Lovely afternoon spent enjoying all the foliage and orchids. Hubby loves flowers and plants and could have spent the entire day ensconced in the dome. A must do.
,,not worth the money,2.0,,"at the dome,very boring few trees and flowers here and there,not much of singapore nature.bottle trees,olives trees etc.where are the original plants and flowers from Sgp."
,,Day of fun,5.0,,"This place is amazing, yes it is air-conditioned so good for those hot days but the arrangement of flowers and the way the structure has been made I would recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,A cooling experience in the heat,4.0,,We went to this attraction using our one day Singapore Day Pass. It was an interesting display but probably wouldn't pay full price.
,,Very nice indoor garden,5.0,,"This is an indoor garden that comes with waterfalls and walkway around high cliff that planted with unique plants from all over the world, nice ambient with artistic structure. It is a place good for couple, family or even visiting business associates."
,,Cloud 9,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is arguably one of the best attractions of the entire city. It is essentially a living forest enclosed in a bio-dome.

You know you made the right decision the moment you enter when a gush of cold, air-conditioned wind encapsulates your body. If there's any way of escaping the Singaporean heat, this is definitely it!

The forest is a complex and well-thought out project, illustrating to the fault, the biodiversity and mechanism of a rain forest. As you ascend up the rainforest, the attraction simulates the conditions of that of a real forest. The temperature changes, the flora changes. By that stage, you are literally walking at the same height of the clouds.

It truly is a unique experience even if you have a fear of heights. Definitely well worth the money!"
,,It was really cool,5.0,,"The waterfalls look like a real & lost world part it just like OCBC Skyway but I prefer this one. But the weather is cold, but its fine"
,,Different,4.0,,differenyt experience of a tropical rain forest in a closed environement... cloud walk is nice....visit during the day is better
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Cloud Forest exceeded my expectations, truly wonderful place to visit and so well thought out. I've been to The Eden Project in the UK but this place in my opinion is on another level. The most amazing plants and every kind of orchid you could think of. Many plants of which I have never seen before. The sky walkways really ensure that you see the plants up close and as there are lifts, people with disabilities would not have any problem with access issues. Really wonderful attraction, spent several hours here just admiring the beauty of it all."
,,Awesome at night!,5.0,,We loved this cool experience and the surrounding complex in Singapore. Was particularly fun at night to go thru! It's deceptively large inside.
,,And another must see hit in Singapore.,5.0,,After travelling around the world for so many years one becomes a bit blasé about what you see and it gets harder and harder to be impressed. But I was impressed with this exhibit. As soon as you step inside and see the towering waterfall in front of you it is impossible not to be impressed. And I didn’t talk yet about the walkway high up at tree top level! It doesn’t get any better than the Flower Dome and the Rainforest when it comes to conservatories. Singapore upped the ante again and proved this city is in a class of its own.
,,Singapore wins again,5.0,,"Another 1st class attraction in Singapore.Wonderful,just like the rain forest,and yes I have been to a couple.Very high winding walkway but no trouble for the older person,lifts will take you to the top and escalators wil bring you down.Do not miss it."
,,Amazing place - worth a visit,5.0,,"Its an extremely beautiful place, an amazing creation. Its a vertical garden, totally man-made, with waterfalls and beautiful landscaping. Worth a visit for sure."
,,Exquisite display of flora,4.0,,"This man-made attraction houses thousands of flora that makes you feel like you are in the rain forest. The huge waterfalls is incredible. What's make it more amazing is that you can go up to the top of the dome and take a selfie. If you're afraid of heights please don't look down. They have great walkways which is not a problem even if you're on a wheelchair. I went there early September and even if it's humid outside, you will feel cold here. Nice attraction and worth your while."
,,one of the best,5.0,,"What an astounding place. So many different flowers and especially orchids. Lovely and refreshing. My wife was scared of heights but still managed the walkways because the views were so good. Lovely waterfall on entry then a short walk and a lift to the top. There is no pressure to rush and you hardly see any staff.
Not to be missed as it is one of the best attractions around the world for flowers and artificial waterfalls."
,,Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,Fantastic experience well worth a visit .Visited both Domes . Cloud Forest amazing . All so well maintained . Christmas decorations beautiful .
,,Do Not Miss it,5.0,,"Cloud forest, located in the Gardens by the Bay is one of the top attractions of Singapore which one should not miss. As you enter, you feel in the rain forest and as you go on to the top you feel as if in clouds. You feel cool inside. There is a giant waterfall along with tropical plants and orchids arranged symmetrically. There is a huge display of naturally formed crystals.The Cloud Forest can be enjoyed by all. It is a must see place in Singapore."
,,"Clever presentation, stimulating experience",5.0,,"Singapore has constructed two massive glass domes, one for a Cloud Forest and another is the Flower Dome. Both are very handy to the train station or a delightful walk from Marina Bay Sands hotel.
Inside the forest dome they have reproduced tropical rainforest conditions, with a number of sections relating to different parts of the world and varying altitudes.
It gets colder as you wind towards the top, but it's barely noticeable as you are so engrossed in the information and superb presentation of plants, waterfalls and other features.
As always in this great city, it's clean, well sign-posted, and there is good access for people with special needs.
It takes a good hour or so to benefit from all the information, and one should not rush it anyway. It is a place of real peace and harmony with the Creation around us."
,,beautiful garden,5.0,,I came by night and it is so beautiful especially with the lamp all over the garden. Because i came at night so i cant see the garden clearly cause its too dark on there
,,Great place,5.0,,"A great place never seen so many species of trees, plants, flowers in one place. An amazing piece of engineering."
,,Part of the new Gardens by the bay project,3.0,,"The new Gardens by the bay is an amazing complex and so much to see including the Cloud forrest but for me the cloud forrest was not the experience expected but as part of the overall complex worth a visit. After being blown away by the gardens which were better than the UK Eden project, I expected a lot more from the cloud forrest and was a little dissapointed. It is a large man made ""mountain like"" structure with a metal walkway taking you around the edge overlooking trees etc but not sure why they call it a ""Cloud Forrest"" not really very interesting, there are some facts about Forrests etc but probably the best part was the coolness after a few hours of Singapore heat, I was ready for a cold beer!!. Anyway, as you have probably bought an all in ticket, give it a go!."
,,Must See,5.0,,"One of a kind biosphere and mechanical forest. Multiple levels, each with unique environment and views. Easy to get to by train or taxi with good food nearby."
,,I didn't see any clouds there,3.0,,"The directions were confusing, out of the 7 floors, one floor has videos playing, another floor has Stalactite formations kept. There is not much to see if you go on each of the floors, the plantation is only external."
,,A must see forest.,5.0,,"Cloud forest - A name so well chosen for one of the star attraction of Singapore.At bottom you feel in the forest and as you climb the circular path to the top you feel you r in clouds as well. Very well planned, executed and maintained. Children as well as elders can enjoy and feel comfortable in the well maintained temperature control inside d huge dome. While in Singapore and in Marina Bay a must see place along with d Singapore Flyer."
,,Wonderful!,4.0,,"This park (or forest?) is wonderful! I feel like stepping in the world of avatar. So cool and nice, perfect place to sit and think (if it not as crowded as this place). Again, maybe there are no place in Singapore that is not crowded.

But this place is a must-go in Singapore!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The prospect of a visit to the Gardens by the Bay, as requested by my wife, filled me with dread as I am not a 'plant hugger' but ten seconds in this air conditioned bio dome with the five plus storey high mountain and waterfall converted me. True, I could not spend a day in there, but combined with the partner bio dome of international gardens, also air conditioned, the view from the ""Magic trees"" near by, and the short walk to the marina barrage and an excellent eating area, it is a must location to visit for any one holidaying in Singapore."
,,Amazingly done,5.0,,What an astounding feat to make a rainforest complete with waterfalls inside a futuristic glass dome.
,,Nice a great piece of engineering,4.0,,"Worth going to especially on a hot day, which is every day in Singapore. Its beautiful, cool and something very different"
,,AWESOME,5.0,,"we had read many Tripadvisor reviews but nothing prepared us for the AWESOME DISPLAYS, great engineering feat and well planned get- arounds. MUST SEE. !! and it's cool- a nice relief from the Singapore heat."
,,Decent representation,4.0,,I would say it's a decent representation of a rainforest. Though it would be nice if the waterfall looked more natural instead of steel/metal funnels/pipes.
,,Amazing Setting,4.0,,Fantastic exhibition of some exotic plants and flowers on display here - worth the trip out there to see.
,,amazing,5.0,,"The cloud forest is located in the Gardens by the Bay, a superbly designed area located behind the amazing towers with the boat on top. You can easily get to here by the MRT. Once you're here you can see all the other sights plus walk back to down town via the Helix bridge . You can spend the whole day here. The Cloud forest and the Flower dome are environmentally controlled domes which are immense. You have to experience them There is a water fall and living forest inside."
,,Amazing Garden,4.0,,"The conservatory has the right amount of temperature, ie. not too cold. Loved the cascade of the waterfalls. Tropical plants, orchids & begonias were arranged with symmetry in mind. The treetop walk was a good idea for everyone to admire the garden itself."
,,Something different!,5.0,,"Worth the money to see this beauty! Unlike anything else seen in the world, this is a lovely site to see. It takes about one hour. This is a lot more entertaining than the flower dome! Interactive modules when leaving the attraction are very interesting and inform you about how gardens by the bay was designed and it's purposes! Very interesting"
,,Exceptional experience,5.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest Dome during a tropical storm with cascades of water within and without! There is a modest fee for entry, with multiple re-entry on the same day possible. The artificial mountain with vertical garden and water fall is impressive, with floating walkways. How this large space could be air conditioned so effectively is impressive. We spent an entire afternoon both here and in the flower dome.

Highly recommended."
,,Impressive,5.0,,A very well designed tropical forest that is both impressive and interesting. Also a great way to beat the Singapore heat for an hour or so whilst at Gardens By The Bay.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Green, lush, well-thought out, beautiful flowers, worth a visit while in Singapore, plus many more gardens to visit within the complex"
,,Rainforest,4.0,,"Im not into flowers and plants but I was surprised to see the cloudforest, the weather was very hot the day we went to SG but the cloudforest and the flower dome are airconditioned so we felt relaxed walking around. I suggest to buy ticket online for convenience. Good for picture taking. Nice place. ☺"
,,An amazing plant spectical,5.0,,The experience was incredible in terms of plants. However the dome is exceptionally cold so take a warm fleece with you and don't wear shorts even though the outside temperature is hot and humid. Worth visiting however.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I enjoyed my time at the Cloud Forest. The giant waterfall is very impressive and I took the lift to the top and then made my way down the walkway stopping to examine plantings as I went.

It was lovely and cool inside, but I didn't find it to be too cold. I was lucky because it wasn't very crowded on the day I went which was a Monday.

Hint: Exit the MRT and head straight down the path ahead leading to the shuttle bus. It only costs S$2 for the journey to and from the domes and it will really save your legs. It is a long way to walk."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Experience: 4.5/5. I'll give it 5/5 for the uniqueness.
must see for tourists in Singapore.i loved it.however the experience is amplified 10x if you are one of these
1.nature/forest lover
2.garden lover
They're both interchangeable to an extent but cloud forest fits the first category more.even people not belonging to either will like it.maybe not love it but the arrangements and amount of work put into the display surely shows.
Its also cool inside + mist sprays/humidifiers(don't know what they're called) are awesome.stay away from the top section if you are asthmatic/allergic as the mist/droplets may cause problems.the summit just happens to be the best part of cloud forest too with a superb walkway.go by the other reviews and pics.don't miss it."
,,Stick with the cloud forest theme,3.0,,"There are pros and cons with regards to this feature dome. It is based on the theme of a cloud forest and the exterior surface or ""skin"" of this magnificent 7 storey high mountain justifies a 5 star rating for visual impact, assortment of plant species , vertical gardening, architecture and cool waterfalls.

However, there is also a core within this mountain which must accomodate the lift shaft and then what do you do with the remaining floor spaces within this core? Simply fill it up with a few crystal displays, perhaps a floor showcasing stalactites and stalagmites, flashing monitors of graphs and geographical terrains haphazardly on one of the floors? In this aspect, not only does it fail to be congruent with the cloud forest theme but the displays themselves look artificial, unimpressive and out of place. To this, i can only eke out a poor 1 star rating. Hence its average 3 stars. ( Oh BTW whats with the choo choo train??? ) U mean we can find trains in the rain forest?

There is so much potential to this place but whats inside ( the core) must change to complement its skin.

After spending so much money on sourcing the variety of plants for the vertical gardening part, can't more money be spent to ( for example) make one of the floors with the stalactites look more like a real cave, replete with dim lighting, dripping water sound effects and cave features?

Just a thought. ( And do away with the toy train? please?)"
,,nice stroll,3.0,,"Beautiful flowers and landscaping. Nice waterfall. It was pretty. We went at night, maybe you can see the flowers better during the daytime."
,,On Cloud Forest 9,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is an excellent greenhouse experience within Gardens by the Bay. A giant waterfall, attractive water features, thousands of plants and an aerial walk-way that takes you around the central structure. Well worth the time and money"
,,improving attraction,3.0,,"I have seen this in 2013. It was much below my expectation at that time comperison with the price. The vegetation has improved a lot during this 12 months but it is still a bit below my expectation. In 2 years time the vegetation will be nice and cover the concrete below, but the inside attraction ""crystal mountain"" is very artificial. It is getting better but still a but disappointed to me as a nature lover. From an architectural point of view it is very impressive but inside it should improve to have a real nature experience."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"Didnt like to visit at first because I thought this place would look so artificial. But it was not like that. Amazed by the way it has been built. Even though it cannot be compared with a natural forest, still worth the visit because the experience is amazing."
,,"Okay, if you've got nothing else to do",3.0,,"It's near Marina Bay and we anyway wanted to have a walk through the Gardens at the Bay. So we bought the tickets for the Cloud Forest. When you enter you feel so good - because it's much cooler than outside.

We went up by elevator and had a slow walk down. Yes, it's quite nice, interesting - but nothing stunning."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"An excellent living museum, with great exhibits on nature and global warming. Not to be missed! All sorts of amazing plants in a tropical rain forest. Easy to navigate."
,,It's ok,3.0,,It's constant walking to see their man made Forrest. Not bad I'm just not in to that kind a thing.the waterfall is nice and the view is good.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Visted and had a wonderful time. A must see. Take you time to look at the flowers and the trees. Lots to learn.
,,Beautifully thought and executed,3.0,,"Beautiful , mystic , romantic place - can be best experienced in day light . Avoid visiting it at night unless you have a flight to catch !"
,,Like being up in the highlands (Almost),5.0,,"Before I go on, the Cloud Forest is a manmade attraction. The ground is concrete and there are blowers that blow out cool air. There are educational exhibits that seem a bit incongruous with the 'nature' theme (e.g. the Crystal Mountain).

This really isn't a hardcore nature lover's place. It's nature without the heat, the mosquitos, bugs and dirt. If you are ok with this, it's definitely worth a visit.

The entrance into the Cloud Forest is rather dramatic with the tall manmade waterfall and the cool air in your face.

Further along, are some pretty plants, mostly highland species (the kind you see on Mt Kinabalu). The variegated plants (begonias) which have been planted vertically are very pretty.

There is a little train set with with a miniature town on the left and further on, there's a lift to take to the 6th floor. Take the lift to the 6th floor and walk up the stairs to the 7th floor. After that, walk all the way down, passing pretty plants and a few educational exhibits like Earth Check and +5 degrees (educational video).

The last part of the Cloud Forest is a bit like an enchanted forest with whimsical sculptures like giant snails and doorways shaped like lion mouths.

Some tips:
Place is stroller-friendly.

Misting happens about every 2 hours. I think the timings are 10, 12, 2, 4, etc... Please check with the information desk. The whole place is misty and quite pretty during then.

The place is designed for one-way people traffic. It's challenging to walk against the flow of people and the entrance and exit are not the same.

The lift on the 6th floor to go to the 7th floor is meant for the elderly and those with wheelchairs and strollers. The lift will not be adequate during busy times so take the stairs instead of waiting for the lift if possible.

The exit opens out to the gift shop. Once you exit the shop, you will see the waterfront. Turn left and walk along the waterfront to reach MBS (Near the Art Science Museum). Walk right to reach Children's Garden, Satay By the Bay and Marina Barrage (In that order)"
,,Amazing and wonderful to see!,5.0,,"Just magnificent with the waterfall and the pockets of gardens and the suspended walkways - awesome!! Take your time to enjoy it in there, there is so much to see. A must see when you are in Singapore. Allow a couple of hours for this or more if you can. Visit the Flower Dome first, then the Cloud Forest, and then head over to the Supertrees - preferably get to the Supertrees at dusk to see them lit up and then the trees dance to music at 7.45pm and 8.45pm - a priceless experience!! A walk on the Skywalk at the Supertrees also essential. Loved it all!"
,,fun experience,5.0,,"Visit here before Flower Dome. It's quite humid in here so you can't just sit and relax, but you can do that in Flower dome! P.S. Beware of a big rat!"
,,"felt it as a natural place, but its not natural",4.0,,"this is a very good place for visitors. but this is not a natural place, everything is human created except plants. but they designed it for nature lovers."
,,"Cloud forest, Singapore",4.0,,Worth the visit. It is within the gardens by the bay. It is so cool in there with waterfalls and all the vegetation. It's an exciting display of vertical gardening.
,,Go at Night,4.0,,Very weird but worth the trip at night when the installations are lit up and eerily devoid of tourists with Marina Bay Sands giving a great backdrop. The cafe / restaurant is super expensive so maybe forget about it!
,,unique experience,5.0,,it is a very unique and interesting place. i visited at night and it took on a magical and surreal quality . coming into this cool misty place was also a relief after walking through the warm city throughout the day . aside from the plants the exhibits are also very interesting
,,Magical especially at night!,5.0,,"I went there late afternoon and it looked even better after sunset. It is a magical place with nice colours, plants, artificial waterfall... It seemed both natural and futuristic in a way. Beautiful and original creation! It seems to be the perfect place for a proposal! There is a lift to reach the lost world on top of the hill. I recommend it! Even more than the flower dome."
,,So cool on a hot day!,5.0,,"The scale and effort that has gone into Cloud Forest is quite amazing. It was pure relief to walk into here on a hot day, but then that joy was followed by even more at the beautiful set up of this place. Definitely worth a look!"
,,A different kind of dome - interesting,4.0,,"The concept was interesting - a large indoor mountain and water fall,
places to walk out on.

- You go up inside the large mountain and can work your way down
- The cool misty air provides a nice break from the outside
- There are a few exhibits as you make your way down that are interesting to see

I'm giving it a 4 out of the novelty but in some regards I still found it came up short.
Nevertheless it's still worth visiting"
,,Head In The Clouds,4.0,,"What a way to experience a garden. Not being used to the heat and humidity that is Singapore, what a nice relief it was to enter this giant glass dome (conservatory) to find a lovely regulated 20 something celsius temperature. Even if you are not into gardens, plants or horticulture, this is an amazing place to visit. The display gardens are magnificent, with the centrepiece waterfall providing an amazing spectacle in its own right. Take a lift to the top and then amble along the gently sloping ramp back to ground level, taking in the many different spices of plants along the way, not to mention the views of Singapore city on the outside. Cost was S$28.00 per person for this and the adjacent flower dome, we paid an extra S$2.00 each for the shuttle from the Marina Bay entrance of the gardens."
,,What a place,5.0,,What an oasis! And what a place to spend a time wandering in the garden all in air conditioned comfort!
,,Great way to relax,5.0,,"Walked around the gardens for a couple of hours with friends, great way to relax and unwind. The variety of plant-life is amazing."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Very unique. A must see. Give it at least half a day. As the place is beautiful at night, plan it such that you get to see it once in day light, and then again at night."
,,Wow this is not to be missed,5.0,,"It is hard to put into words the feeling you get going into this giant dome. The carefully controlled climate is perfect for the rainforest rare flowers, ferns etc. A giant waterfall flows from the top of the dome to the floor some 60 Meters. If I had more time in Singapore I would go again."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Do not miss this! A fabulous way to spend a couple of hours. Lovely plants and flowers presented in a unique way - you literally walk at treetop level on carefully thought out pathways( not at all worrying for height sufferers) Very educational too if you have time to ponder and read all the info given
,,Cool,5.0,,"This place is cool, in both senses. After walking through high heat and humidity, to walk into a dome with a huge waterfall with spray being directed at you is heaven.
Take the lift to the top and walk down, worth taking your time.
Go early in the morning before the crowds turn up. Having the whole place to yourself is even better."
,,beautiful attraction,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a nice place to walk, with bridges and views. Not the cheapest experience so we chose to only do the Cloud Forest and not the Flower Dome, but a good family experience that takes about two hours to go through."
,,Definitely should visit,4.0,,"Constructed under the dome with man made waterfall, tropical plants, footbridges extending into mid-air. This is a place must go."
,,Do it,5.0,,"Wonderful, thought it would be a tourist trap but was so much fun. Quite freaky with the heat and humidity listening to Christmas songs in the Flower Dome, magical decorations and very festive"
,,Amazing for anyone too see,5.0,,Doesnt matter if your not a plant or tree person...this is a must. It was simply an amazing experience.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"This state of the art ""garden"" provides a glimpse of what our gardens would look like in the future."
,,A Vision of the Future,5.0,,"THese constructions are superb, enormous and encyclopaedic. I think I glimpsed what the future of city life might hold."
,,Good place to visit even with kids,4.0,,We went there with the kids age 7 and 11 and they liked the place. Beautiful made and the waterfall is amazing
,,Highlight of a Business Trip,5.0,,"While in Singapore for two weeks on business, I had the chance to make it to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. This was one of the highlights of my trip.

The Cloud Forest was amazing! The vegetation and foliage was lush and beautiful. Make sure to bring your camera!

If I had to choose between the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, the Cloud Forest would win...hands down. Everyone in my party would agree too!"
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,For the people that have not had the opportunity to visit a rain forest this is the perfect overview in miniature.
,,lovely place!,5.0,,this is one of the man-made marvels! a really tall waterfall enclosed in an air conditioned dome and walkways at different levels. the availability of lifts to all these levels made the visit quite enjoyable!
,,Dome Management Incompetent,2.0,,"had overseas visitors wishing to visit the domes. I rang on the Sunday and was told the cloud dome would be closed on Monday for maintenance. Tuesday the flower dome would be closed.
So we decided to go on Wednesday, the last day of their visit to Singapore. We bought tickets but when we reached the entrance we were refused entry as there was a fire drill and it could take up to 3 hours. We returned to the kiosk and had to fight to get a refund. 10 minutes later it was announced that the domes would open. Bought tickets again.
20 minutes into the visit to the cloud dome the lifts were closed and patrons could not continue - fire drill. The fire door to the lifts was closed but patrons were still coming in the entrance.
Finally fire door to lifts were opened and a surge of people entered the lifts. At the top the fire door was closed for another ten minutes or more trapping a large crowd between the lifts and another fire door. In a real fire these people could have been burned alive.
Very incompetent achieving nothing and displaying a complete lack of understanding of fire procedures, training and management."
,,"Great place, quiet surprising !",4.0,,"The cloud forest is very well done and quiet surprising ! I really liked it !
Knowing that it takes place in Singapore, it adds a bit of crazyness. Also, it is very interesting and well done - congratulations !
Don;t forget your jumper ! And allow 2 hours."
,,Impressive?,2.0,,"Yes, it is the result of a huge investment project - the enormous artificial mountain covered with a sheer infinite amount of plants stuck to it. There are incredible bridges, elevators, escalators, artificial waterfalls, aircondition (bring a warm jacket!), visual shows, backdrop music etc...
But how far away from nature such a showcase has to go in order to present to us ""nature""?
Less would have been more."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Excellent, really had the atmosphere of mist in the forest. Waterfall was great and the sky walk is an amazing feature letting you see plants all the way up the waterfall."
,,fantastic place,5.0,,This is a great place with lots of plants and an indoor water fall... A lovely cool place on a hot day....admission price was very reasonable also
,,A Place to Cool Down,5.0,,"After walked around the Marina Bay, my family went to Gardens by the Bay to relax. It made us feel fresh and power up! The air inside this dome is very fresh. The plants are rare and beautiful. Worth to see."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The massive dome of the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome next door are impressive architectural achievements. The interior is creatively designed and features a variety of natural phenomena. The waterfall is impressive and the aerial walkways not only gives wonderful views of the features of the dome, but also the Singapore cityscape. Well worth a visit."
,,3x,5.0,,"I went there 3 times, but I do not feel bored... even watching the movie about +5 Celcius. I enjoy the scenery inside and outside the dome..."
,,Go here when you visit the Gardens,4.0,,"When visiting Gardens by the Bay, definitely go to the cloud forest. It's pricey, but definitely worth it. The 'forest' is very informative, and uniquely shaped, you won't see anything like this anywhere else. I'd pick this over the flower dome if I'd have to make a choice between the two."
,,Amazing,5.0,,My first visit awed me and both myself and my wife were amazed. When our friends visited singapore we never fail to take the chance to bring them to visit cloud forest. Simply amazing
,,Cooling down,4.0,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay during our stay and since it was raining we sought shelter in the Cloud Forest greenhouse. I thought the entry charge was a little expensive, but then again it must cost a lot to run. The attraction itself was very interesting and full of many tropical rainforest plants, especially orchids. The whole place is cooled, I am not sure whether artificially or through the evaporation of the water from the waterfall.
All in all, very interesting and worth doing especaily with children as an educational visit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I went there with my daughter. That place was so beautiful and lots of unknown beautiful plants made us very interested.
,,just OK,4.0,,"This was a good day trip for us.just be sure to wear good walking shoes if you plan on visiting If you like waterfalls ,you will enjoy this one ."
,,trip,5.0,,"a very good experience, spectacularly done, one could imagine being in the wilds of Borneo, not for the people not liking heights"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Absolutely a must, wonderful experience. Beautiful scenery and orchids and plants. The stalactites and mites were fantastic"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Its a brilliant place to go to... The pleasant scenery and the sheer vies of it is mesmerizing. The massive variety of plants and the walk itself through the place is very pleasant. You can but an audio guide outside itself for a nominal charge and it takes you through the entire place.
,,Fantastic!!!,5.0,,A must when visiting the city. The experience of walking on the ropes is very realistic as I done it so in the amazon forest.
,,Superb and cooling,5.0,,"The first thing we noticed was how cool it was after walking in the sun to the garden. Quite a striking sight, with lots of levels with beautiful orchids and a cave stalagmite/stalagtite exhibit."
,,A Day out exploring,4.0,,A really interesting place and well worth the visit. The waterfall is beautiful. The outside broadwalk looks great if you're not afraid of heights. Enjoyed my visit there.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Loved the biome, planting was impeccable and beautifully maintained and cool temperate climate welcome! Very educational"
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"Nice place to visit at the garden by the bay, A great place to enjoy your day.very wide varity of plants from all over the world to enkoy."
,,outstanding,5.0,,"out of the two gardens by the bay domes this is my favourite but no less spectacular. wonderful to walk around and great to see and enjoy the coolness inside as well as see all the amazing species of flowers and plants.

don't go on a sunday or public holiday, go off peak and take your time."
,,Interesting and educational for all!,4.0,,"Interesting visit to a man-made architectural structure, which replicates a rainforest atmosphere, in an artificially created environment!

Scary thought for some, but an educational tool for others. Highlights the need to protect our natural environment and take care of what we have.

There are lifts available, however people are encouraged to walk along allocated walkways to enjoy the full range of displays. Vegetation, flowers etc were lovely.

A great place to visit in the middle of the day to escape the heat. Combine tickets it with a trip to the other dome and the gardens. Check opening hours before visiting. It is closed for cleaning once a month."
,,"Worth a visit, the walk is amazing",4.0,,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to visit this attraction - I don't do heights so didn't think I would get much out of it, however they have made the viewing path in such a way that people who are not keen on heights - like me - can enjoys amazing views without panicking.
Ther is a waterfall that is like nothing else I have seen before, and although I do like my garden I am not a plant fanatic, but everything was so beautiful.
Luckily it wasn't busy to we could take our time, definitely worth a visit"
,,What an experience!,5.0,,After looking at the waterfalls take the elevator to the top level and then walk down the eirie pathways while watching the tropical plants exhibits.
,,Just amazing and not to be missed!,5.0,,It was a magical experience - never seen anything like it in my life! The imagination behind this attraction left me breathless.
,,The better of the two domes in Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"We bought a ticket for the skyway and both domes. The arial walkway was probably the best value, and this was the best of the two domes. Not sure, knowing what I know now, that I would have paid to go in the flower dome. The Botanic Gardens (free) and National Orchid Garden (5 Sing Dollar) far better."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Loved this attraction. Nothing bad to say at all. Great place to take the family or that romantic walk.
,,Unique but tad gimmicky,4.0,,"Multi-floor attraction with lifts but encouraged to use stairs and escalators unless necessary. Pricey. But as soon as you enter. The huge waterfall is so thrilling that you almost realise the worth immediately. For kids and educators of a certain age this will be mindblowing. My young kids were just happy with the spray from the waterfall and cloud walk. Hubby and I loved the views of the sky and the bay. The flowers and plants were pretty. The pool in lost land is Beautifully designed. They seem to Be gunning for environmental awareness but the mood we were in, we skimmed over those parts. I call it gimmicky as it is a completely artificial world talking about tHe power of nature and an urgent need to take care of the climate and environment."
,,Wow incredible,5.0,,Most amazing green house I have ever been in Words cannot describe it A must see for all who visit Singapore
,,Surprisingly good,4.0,,"Orchid garden and Gardens by the Bay get all the reviews but this is well worth the effort. Waterfall at entry confronting and a refreshing beginning. Elevated walkways a surprising highlight (for someone who doesn't like heights -but they offer close-ups that would not be available otherwise)...all in all, highly recommended. PS if with kids - look for the crocodiles in the waterways"
,,I always bring my foreign friends to view this man-made wonder!,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest in Gardens by the Bay is a must see!!! Standing at 35-metre tall this man made mountain is covered in lush vegetation shrouding the world’s tallest indoor waterfall showcases plant life from tropical highlands. I have taken many beautiful photos with my foreign friends when they visit Singapore for the first time. (PS: Be careful of your camera when you stand too close to the mist from the waterfall... I learnt that the hard way once..Hahah)

Don't miss out exploring the Black Box (GB Model) inside the Cloud Forest as it provides interesting information behind the Supertrees. (ie.capturing solar energy and serving as exhausts all while supporting a green living skin). As well as how Singapore’s parks and gardens provide discarded plant matter as fuel for a biomass furnace that provides energy to cool the air in both conservatories.

I think it opens from 9am to 9pm and tickets for tourists range from $15 for children to $28 for adult. Locals get discounted prices by producing their NRIC(ID).

Great for all ages!!!"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The atmosphere is great and nice and cool, the walkway down takes one through the different levels of a rain forest complete with waterfalls and incredible vertical plantings. A definite must as part of your visit to the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"This is superb architecture and very pleasent feeling. The Waterfall, the thunder showers and walk way really make us very happy."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"Exploring the cloud forest is a pretty unique experience. In one sense it is a little artificial with the glass roofing and metallic walkways. But there is some fantastic plant life to see and a unique atmosphere with the giant waterfall, vapour clouds and unusual exhibits.

Definitely worth a visit."
,,garden wonderland,5.0,,"excellent just for the experience lots of school kids on excursion, but very well behaved, just noisy"
,,CLIMB A MOUNTAIN WITH AN ELEVATOR,4.0,,"Hey man, Want to go mountain climbing but have a bad back, or afraid of walking too much? This mountain has an elevator in it so you can go mountain elevating. This is the world's tallest indoor waterfall at 35m. Cool fact, or not. Bye"
,,Manmade but natural feel,4.0,,I liked the cludy mist and different flora in cloud dome with educational video on global warming and different types of rocks kept in halls. The waterfall is stunning to watch from ground level than the ramp on higher floors.
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"We both really enjoyed the experience, my only comment was, that after dark, you could do with slightly more light"
,,Impressive - a must experience,5.0,,"On entering the Dome you'r confronted by a seven storey waterfall cascading down an articial dome covered with plants from the rain forests of South America...and you feel the mist and coolness of the forest... an impressive entrance...Take the elevator to the 7th floor and then wind your way back though the plants and trees of the rainforest areas, carnivurous varieties, vines, beautiful orchids and the like...the tour downwards spirals through overhead walk ways and exhibitions all designed to give you the experience of being in a rain forest and seeing from above as well as at eye level...At the end is an informative video on global warming that has a important message for us all....An impressive exhibition all round"
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,"I was amazed at this beautiful artifical mountain. Go to the top, enjoy the walk around and the ""clouds"" - my favourite of th cloud and flower domes."
,,good,5.0,,loved the mist. the scenery was nice. it was nice to spend some time there & take pics. must see attraction in Singapore.
,,"Amazing Mountain Flora, Close-Up!",4.0,,"Upon entering the attraction, you get a blast of cool mist from the awesome waterfall. A truly inspiring man-made vertical garden. The most comprehensive amassing of wild highland plants I've ever seen in one place, set in a bright but cool environment. We enjoyed every part of this forest and were also treated to a high altitude walk on the steel grated walkways which is scary for some. I felt cold as the sun hid itself in the clouds and the ""mountain air"" was nice and chilly. So be prepared if you're wearing shorts and a singlet. Worth visiting again."
,,Impressed,4.0,,"Visited when at gardens by the bay, was very nice attraction . A cool oasis in Csingapore. You will visit when at Gardens by the bay."
,,Simply amazing Dome!,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay. Have to pay an entry fee, but it's worth it. Take the lift to the 7th storey, then walk down in circular manner. In between, there are several exhibits, like rock crystals, slide shows in an amphi-theatre on global warming, etc."
,,Astounding light and sound show,5.0,,Initially this appeared quite out of place but Singapore is such a diverse city / country it seems as if they can do anything and make a success of it. An engineering feat and very entertaining.
,,WOW,5.0,,"That feeling when you enter a place then stop midstep, look up and the only thing you can say is ""wow!"". The Cloud Forest in Gardens by the Bay can give you that reaction. It's best for you to not know as much of the place (well, just know enough to bring a jacket and a full charged cam) so that you can really have that moment to appreciate what you are seeing."
,,Nice big waterfall in the cloud dome,5.0,,it is a spectacular sight of a man made HUGE waterfall in the dome. Amazing eco systems that keeps the plants & place alive.
,,Amazing must see,5.0,,"On entering the Dome you see a beautiful waterfall & mist & cool of the Forest. Am elevator gets you to the top & you wind your way down on the walkways reading & learning about the forest plants, taking photos. At the end a amazing video on global warming one should sit & see."
,,A clear message,5.0,,Amazing attraction and well worth the effort to visit. The Cloud forest is excellent on its own but the addition of the information supplied on the lower levels about our environment and what we can do as a nation to help is outstanding. I encourage young and old to soak up all the information and start taking positive steps towards looking after our children's future
,,Amazing biosphere,5.0,,"As you walk around, you will see zillions of different plants, colorful and exotic. This park is truly unique and well worth the visit."
,,Great,5.0,,Need to visit in daylight as there is a charge at it closes at dusk. Then go back in the night for the laser show which is free
,,Definately worth a visit,5.0,,"We visited this attraction having read good reviews and hotel staff recommending it! However although we expected it to be good it far exceeded our expectations. The skywalk gave fantastic views of the city and was very cheap. Usually I am not keen on heights and at first found the walkway a bit frightening. Especially as it is very narrow in places. The cloud and flower gardens are very unusual and well worth a visit. We also paid to go to the tree top bar,it costs 18 Singapore dollars to access which includes an alcoholic beverage. The views of the city were incredable and we went up there just before dusk so saw the city in the daylight and then all lit up as it went dark. We then watched the light display which is on twice nightly from the ground as we were advised that was the best place to see it. The display was amazing and certainly worth watching and was free. There are many areas of the park which can be accessed free but I would definitely also recommend the payable attractions to as wevthoughtvit was amazing and such good value for money"
,,Very well put together,5.0,,"Enjoyed our visit very much - very well done and great for all ages. Nice walks, interesting information and beautiful plants. Much better than the Flower Dome next door (which was a bit dull...)"
,,More stuff to see than I expected,4.0,,"Thoughtfully-designed, with lots of plants/trees, waterfalls, crystals, and a magical still pond that is still confusing me."
,,Fascinating To See,5.0,,"The Cloud Dome is one of two fee based attractions in the Garden's By The Bay, but I would recommend both. This is a unique building and I have been twice. The first time the temp and humidity was perfect and as you reached the top of the Cloud Mountain you were engulfed by mist - very unique and very interesting. The second time, it wasn't misty and not sure whether it was because of the time of day, but still a fascinating trip down the winding walkway."
,,Pretty impressive,3.0,,"We found ourselves walking around this after we went to have a look at the Marina Sands hotel, which you would naturally do if you arrive in Singapore because it looks cool. Go watch the free light show on the bay at night as it's not bad. The cloud forest looks alright and is worth a walk about as well."
,,Get you head in the clouds,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is part of the Gardens by the Bay and is one of the great domes that create the artificial climates in various parts of the dome/s
Misting, the humidity and the top of an artificial mountain all contribute to the head in the clouds effect as you walk around the mountain and out onto a walkway that takes you out over the forest
The plants, colors, and atmosphere are magical particularly when you acknowledge that much of what you see is 'vertical gardening', It certainly makes you want try your own little version when you get home."
,,Excellent day out,5.0,,"You will LOVE being there - excellent, great place. Fun & new at least this is from 2014 & beyond, we'll done."
,,Surprisingly Good,4.0,,"In comparison to Singapore's fantastic Botanic Garden, 'Garden's by the Bay' has a rather man-made feeling. However the Cloud Forest - one of the attractions based at Gardens by the Bay - is rather fun and worth a visit. Visitors journey to the top of a simulated mountain side, which is housed in what looks like an enormous greenhouse. The views from the top, looking down to the visitors below, are good - although a challenge to anyone with a fear of heights! Walkways then curve around and lead you down to floor level again - along with some help from the escalators. Steam is generated to create the 'clouds', which is effective. There is a rich mix of plant life to enjoy, as well as a small, yet lovely, model railway."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"This wasn't built when I was working in Singapore, so I wanted to visit during a stopover from London last April. A really interesting experience if you like plants and nature - and heights. Also, visit the temperate garden next door if you have the time"
,,Nice to see but not worth returning to,4.0,,"It's a nice, unique man-made structure that is nice to see once, but not worth returning to. Been there twice, only because I needed to tour friends, but after the first time, the next visit was anti-climactic."
,,A wonderful exhibit,5.0,,"When you enter The Cloud Forest dome, the first thing you see is the waterfall. The most beautiful indoor waterfall in the world. I think it's nearly 150 feet tall. You then take the elevator to the top and follow the walkways that wind through this man-made mountain. At times the views are from the backside of the waterfall, then again you enter a suspended walkway to see the frontside. The vegetation in and around this mountain is beautiful. At the lowest levels they have several large exhibits dealing with global warming and give "" dire warnings"" of what will happen in the next 50 years or the catastrophes if the warms up even 1 degree."
,,A must see for any visitor to Singapore,5.0,,A really special place and if you go no-where else in Singapore you must see the Cloud Forest and the Gardens around it. It was fairly expensive but once inside you understand why. The Cloud Forest is an amazing place and real experience. You can while away a few hours (if the weather is kind) Words can't describe it properly.
,,Excellent - a very pleasant surprise.,5.0,,"We didn't expect what we got here - inside the cloud forest dome it is even more impressive than the photos will have you believe. Spend an hour or so strolling around learning about the forest, environment and taking in the fresh air and numerous types of flower. Worth the walk from Marina Bay."
,,amazing!,5.0,,"although quite expensive, i would really recommend visiting here. its something really different and really amazing. such a beautiful waterfall!"
,,wonderful,4.0,,"This had to be our top experience in Singapore, its a must and you come out completely energised from all the wonderful trees and plants. You also watch an amazing video on global warming, if this place doesn't convince you to save our forests then nothing will."
,,Outstanding.,5.0,,"The best I have ever seen, see by night as well as by day. Stay for the excellent light & music display at certain times."
,,Spectacular Profusion of Exotic Plants,5.0,,"From the amazing waterfall to the world-class display of vegetation, this cloud forest dome is a must see in Singapore. Bring your best camera and plan on two hours in this dome."
,,one of a kind,5.0,,one of a kind experience. we visited during day and then at night again and experienced it differently both times
,,A pleasant garden,4.0,,The flowers and greenery. Take a stroll. Very pleasant especially on a hot afternoon. The crystal display was interesting.
,,Good if you are nature lovers,4.0,,"so much to see, in a small place.. if you go with children, be careful in some part/steps. interesting place for children"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Really fabulous place to spend a few hours in Singapore. Entrance to the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome is very reasonable and you could easily spend an hour in each. My recommendation is to wander the free parts of the Gardens By The Bay then visit the Cloud Forest when the heat gets to much! Also very handy if you are visiting the Gardens and Singapore delivers one of it's unpredictable rain showers.
,,A MUST SEE ATTRACTION IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"The outside view does not give you any idea as to what lies inside, the inside is mind blowing. When you first enter the Cloud Forest you are faced with a stunning waterfall as well as getting relief from the outside temperature & humidity. One can easily walk to to the top and enjoy the view of all of the plants from fantastic walkways. There are exhibits and also a video presentation. A must to see!!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,Impressive gardens and pleasant walk around. It is great to see so much emphasis on gardens and trees all over Singapore.
,,Up in the clouds,4.0,,Superb variation on botanical gardens with spectacular views and wonderful plants. The only thing that prevents it from being a five star attraction is the expense. For foreigners it is very expensive for two adults.
,,For the Nature Lovers,5.0,,Great place to hang out especially during the summer season - it is relatively chilly inside but it is a nice place to chill and admire the beauty of nature - a place i would recommend for the nature lovers.
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"This was an incredible sight to see - huge wow factor at the entrance and then a vertigo-inducing walk from the top. The views of the city are fantastic too, I imagine it looks amazing at night.

Be aware that there is an option to visit the cloud forest on its own, the ticket is $16 (you don't have to go round the flower dome too). For some reason they don't advertise this."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely not to be missed, this place will mesmerise you if you are a garden lover. A cool oasis in a steamy city."
,,Amazing place to visit...,5.0,,What an incredible place this is.. you enter and walk right in front of the Water Fall.. then you have the hill with all the flowers and plants and then you can climb up to the various walkways.. Defo a place to visit..
,,cool place,5.0,,This place is worth the visit even if you only intend to stay for the cool temperature and take a break from the regular hot and humid weather in Singapore. A scenic and refreshing spot in the city!
,,Head in the Clouds? Yes!!!!!!,5.0,,"Wonderful gardens, great technology, a wonderful unique place to visit. Don't miss the side trails. Fun for everyone!"
,,A must see......,5.0,,"This is an amazing phenomenon of architecture and excellence. The amount of thought that has go into this building and plant life etc is really a marvellous 'green' achievement in our day. Would highly recommend. Take a taxi, They are cheap here! There is a cover charge, however if you go into the flower dome (which is definitely worth seeing) it will cost $28.00."
,,An amazing man made structure with natural beauty,5.0,,"I'm not into plants and flowers but do admire the natural world and enjoy a walk in nature. This was an amazing structure to explore with an ambundance of plant life and a great waterfall. We spent 1.5 hrs walking through, taking photos and just being spellbound by this great structure. Great to be able to touch lots of plants and walk around the platforms strutting in and out of the waterfall, gradually going up. Not very demanding physically, there are even some lifts and escalators and it's is very cool inside. Well worth the visit"
,,wow,5.0,,"highly recommend the audio tour (headset) as it gives you a good overview of the entire 'ecosystem' as well as some of the engineering in place to make it work
allow about an hour & don't forget to check your memory card & battery (especially if its close tot he end of your trip....) as there are none available at the gift shop here"
,,Go at dusk,5.0,,I wasn't planning on going to the Cloud Forest but had some time to kill before the night garden was light up. It was well worth the visit. There was not crowds of people and school children after hours and it was a very different perspective seeing it all at dusk.
,,No words,5.0,,Another amazing place for you to be close to nature ! Kids will love it. Worth to spend one hour there!
,,Amazing structure.,5.0,,"Not for the height averse person, some catwalks are well over 100 ft tall. But is beautiful and should be tried also at night."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,"I commented on this in the Singapore waterfront gardens, But it worth a second comment. I really did not know what to expect and was certainly not disappointed. It is so clever how you can walk around on the skywalk through the trees. It is a peculiar feeling. Enjoy all the photographic opportunities. You can see all around the bay from the top, although it can be hazy at times. Worth the entrance fee."
,,"Fresh, quiet, green... worth spending 1 hour there",5.0,,"Visited it alone end October, really nice and refreshing visit.
Don't miss the 35m-high waterfall, the evening man-made 'fog' (production of 'clouds' inside the building, using hundreds of water pipes)...
Flowers are unique, including 'carnivore' ones.
Very educative 'how to protect the planet' exhibitions and visuals."
,,I love it,5.0,,"Wow! It's amazing.. when you enter the entrance and see the waterfall... just.. speechless... and the temperature, it's cold inside. You can see many plants there and guess it will be a good experience for kids."
,,Cool mountain trip,5.0,,"It's an amazing structure and so cool, a wonderful contrast to the outside heat and humidity. I can't imagine how the gardeners have managed to fix so many plants onto the nearly vertical mountain sides. The suspended walkways give stunning views but are not for those afraid of heights. We met several people who were having an unpleasant time traversing them. Well worth the entrance cost."
,,Huge waterfall,3.0,,"When you enter you will be greeted with the big waterfall at the entrance and thereafter you can proceed to slowly go up by the levels that comes with some displays at each floor. Relaxing and it has a great view of SG when you are at the top. However, I would prefer flower dome over cloud forest as the main attraction here is only the waterfall."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Its a Must Visit... You cannot leave this place without getting astonished. Looks amazing, very well maintained & has a rich flora & fauna. Amazing learning experience for kids"
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"We weren't sure what to expect, but wow, the first thing you see is this amazing waterfall. Also, the temperature takes you by surprise as it is much cooler than outside. It is an interesting place with amazing plants amongst other things. Well worth a visit"
,,Cloud forest is amazing,5.0,,"The title explains. Would not spoil your surprise. You will love it and if you have children, tag them along. They will learn to respect the nature."
,,Nice to see any time,4.0,,The structure inside is very impressive. Lots of nice details to find hidden between the flowers. The documentary downstair is interesting.
,,On cloud nine,5.0,,"A must see as part of a visit to Gardens by the Bay South. It seems strange to enter a massive greenhouse and the temperature to be lower than that outside. On entry you are greeted by a fantastic waterfall cascading from the top of the cloud forest. A lift whisks you to the top of the attraction from where you descend via a series of spectacular walkways that offer tremendous views of the plants and flowers and outside across the bay.

A joint ticket with the Flower Dome is good value."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay are not on general tour intinerary but is a must visit . The dome has a lovely waterfall and on the cloud walk you can see beautiful and different varietes of flowers ,The whole atmosphere is as if one is deep in a tropical jungle. The temperature is maintained at a comfortable level and one can spend hours just simply admiring the variety of plants and flowers One can see also the rare baobab trees
Do take the tour bus which takes you all over the vast gardens with explanations. Also the supertrees are a sight to behold and the views from the cloud walk are great"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Great experience, well worth a look, you'd expect to be humid inside but it's lovely and cool. Didn;t do the flower dome but assume it's also amazing."
,,Majestic,5.0,,This place is truly majestic! Visited this place with friends during night time and it was unbelievably awesome! The waterfalls was just perfect and the mood of the place is so relaxing.
,,Awesome man-made structure simulating a mountain with waterfall and flora and fauna,4.0,,"Personally I simply admired the Singaporean's ability to create a tourist attraction. It is however very obviously man-made, not a natural wonder."
,,Unique - well worth a visit,5.0,,"The cloud forest and the flower dome are definitely worth a visit. The surrounding gardens are also beautifully laid out and are free. you have to pay to go into the domes. I have never come across anything like them before. You probably have to have some interest in gardening, nature etc to get full benefit but we found it very interesting"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I was skeptical about artificial cloud forest in a dome, but I was wrong. They have made is so amazing, it hardly feels artificial. Its so natural. You will be greeted by a waterfall then you can go all the way up, looking at some amazing trees and flowers. The whole place is in a transparent dome so you can get a good view of the area as you go up."
,,Spectacular - a real highlight,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is brilliant - both the huge domes in the Gardens by the Bay are - but especially the Cloud Forest. If you only get to see one of the Domes, see the Cloud Forest. But it's likely you'll be going to both, as non-Singapore nationals have to buy a combined ticket to both Domes. See the Flower Dome first, because the Cloud Forest is the show-stopper!"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,The best part about this was it was air conditioned...and its pretty amazing - be prepared to walk for a while
,,Unbelievable..total enjoyment...can't wait to go back,5.0,,If you don't see it you are missing out on something great. You need to spend a day in the area....only the Singaporeans could produce something so wonderful
,,Awesome,5.0,,What a beautiful attraction to visit. I will be coming back to take more time to see this at a slower pace. We were a bit rushed as we wanted to get to see The Gardens by the Bay light show but what I did see was amazing and beautiful
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Loved everything about the Cloud Forest the waterfall was amazing, the displays incredible. I will be telling all my friends about it."
,,A refreshing and informative break from the heat!,5.0,,"Very interesting walk with some lovely trees and plants, informative as well. A nice break from the heat outside. Great for the kids."
,,WOW,5.0,,This place was AMAZING!! When you enter the building nothing prepares you for the wow that you see!! While I was a little disappointed there didn't appear to be any animal life in this man made structure I am sure there is a good reason why though. The first thing you see when you enter is a huge man made waterfall then you take lifts or stairs up to the top and walk the path up the top and around. This place just was WOW!!
,,Impressive and Beautiful,5.0,,"We visited the Flower Dome first - what an amazing collection of unusual & exotic & well known plants, trees, flowers and shrubs. Fantastic displays, beautifully displayed. After a relaxed walk round we eventually moved on to the Cloud Forest. Wow, its pretty impressive with an abundance of amazing plants to include orchids, pitcher plants, ferns etc. The 35metre man made mountain and waterfall is awesome, which you can climb through - recommended. Don't leave Singapore without doing this together with the rest of Gardens by the Bay."
,,A bubble of mountain forest,4.0,,"A mountain forest, in Singapore, is surely worth a visit, With beautiful flowers, emerald green moss and a fascinating waterfall, this ecosystem has all the right attributes. I also suggest on the way to the exit, to stop a moment and watch the +5 degrees documentary. It will remind you that if we don't stop the global warming, we'll end up seeing mountain forests, only in this dome."
,,Cool and picturesqe.,5.0,,Quite a spectacular garden and waterfall...well worth the visit and at least it is cool inside and lots of exotic plants.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Fascinating to see how Singapore values flora from all over the world and locally. Would have given the flower one a miss is possible but it's not so there. Can't understand how some people can truly believe this was a ""terrible"" experience. Rest of the gardens by the bay also lovely."
,,Excellent way to spend the morning,5.0,,My partner and I spent a wonderfully relaxed morning here walking around the exotic flora and we both thought it was one of the best things we experienced in Singapore. I would recommend going first thing in the morning when less people are there as this adds to the experience.
,,Don't go at night,3.0,,We went when it was getting dark and although ok you could not get the full experience. It would have been nice to be told when we purchased our ticket that its no good at night. Think if you went in the day it would be great to see but really miss out on the full effect once it gets dark. The waterfall was good especially as you walked up the different levels.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,Well worth seeing something you will never see the likes of again! So nice and cool after the outside heat. Wonderful!
,,"This place needs some ""Refreshing""",3.0,,"I have been here several times over the years. But since my first trip a few years ago, I did not notice any upgrading nor changes"
,,Excellent Experience,5.0,,"It's a great experience, learning so much interesting flora and fauna. Really an eye-opener to see almost the whole world flora and fauna."
,,Futuristic Gardens,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is a look into the future in what urban gardens and forests will look like as they already do in Singapore. It is very informative with lots to read, interact and view. It is a well designed facility and can result in a few hours of learning and relaxing."
,,Cloud Forest - Marina Sands Singapore,5.0,,Well worth a visit - it is truly amazing gardens from all over the world are housed in one of the two clouds amongs the gardens on the Bay.
,,Worth the Fee,5.0,,"A lovely, cool place to stroll through on a hot day. A really nice surprise that got a lot of wow's."
,,nice,4.0,,I liked this dome more than the flower dome. It is a nice place to relax a bit and to get away from trafic and the heat.
,,One of my favourite place,5.0,,"Absolutely Brilliant. Informative, well maintained and a must visit. I loved the waterfall. However, sometimes it gets little crowded."
,,A must see.,5.0,,Beautiful and breathtaking - food for thought about our planet. Singaporeans should be justly proud of this innovative garden.
,,Cool and refreshing,5.0,,Walking into the Cloud Forest Dome was like entering another world. Cascading waterfall right before your eyes while mist hangs in the air around a tower of plants. You can climb or lift up to the upper levels and walk around the platforms to get up close and personal with the waterfall.
,,Amazing space!,5.0,,"Great structure, with a cloud forest atmosphere recreation, complete with waterfall, plants and fine mist!!"
,,One of the best experiences I have had!,5.0,,"Walking into the Cloud Forest Dome on a hot day was magical and totally unexpected! It was cool and misty and inside the dome there were hundreds of thousands of rainforest plants, hanging gardens reaching up to the top of the dome which was 7 storeys high! A pathway wound its way up floor by floor but there is a lift for anyone requiring one, it was absolutely magical and definitely not to be missed on a trip to Singapore!"
,,fabulous place,5.0,,Just so many beautiful plants & flowers to see in one place and it is very well planned with ease to get around for everyone. Great photo opportunities.
,,amazing rain forest,4.0,,"well constructed, rain forest in the centre of the town"
,,exiting forest,5.0,,"very interesting forest in a such a small place , also something unusual and must see place, i will say nothing to don't like all was wonderful there."
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,This attraction is stunning ...world class. The city has produced a magnificent garden and educational experience. The scope of the project is monumental and a must visit site for those in Singapore. Only gripe is the higher fees for non-nationals.
,,A very nice place to visit,4.0,,"The cloud forest is quite nice and well planned out.Everything has been laid out very well. The flowers and plants are quite nice, but the ticket is quite expensive."
,,Excellent,5.0,,I really loved visiting this wonderful place. So much work done to make this garden. I would recommend any visitor to Singapore to visit this wonderful place. All fully air conditioned which enables wonderful plant life. There are lifts so the height is not a problem. It is really amazing.
,,Nice expirience,4.0,,"If you are planning on checking out Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest Dome should be on your must-see list. It is amazing expirience and nice example of human creativity + skills of creating such an amazing enviroment indoor. Also whole dome itself is amazing piece of architecture"
,,An unexpected delight!,5.0,,"The cloud forest dome is a magnificent array of greenery. The dome is cool, not at all hot and humid like you would think being a rain forest. Best feature is the waterfall that greets you on entry into the dome, also the elevated walk through is worth it. Well worth a visit."
,,Wow,5.0,,"This amazing dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. The other dome is the Flower Dome- also worth a visit so get a joint ticket as it's good value.

The Cloud Forest Dome is enormous and full of amazing plants. On entry you're greeted by a large cascading waterfall with some water spray ready to catch the unwary visitor. The you look up and up at mass planted bromeliads, orchids and the like. All beautifully done and quite breathtaking. Make sure you take a lift up to the top as there are fantastic views over the city. Then take the walkways down - don't if you're scared of heights as they do jut well out into space - to admire the gardens from a different angle.

The dome is very pleasant temperature wise and much more pleasant than outside.

Well worth a visit."
,,A must see in singapore,5.0,,We all might think that Singapore doesn't have much to to offer because it is too small for a country but that perception is wrong. This attraction shows how creative Singaporeans are. Too beautiful landscape and structure
,,Singapore attractions,5.0,,"We spent 4 hrs at Gardens by the bay , could have spent another 4 . no complaints at all its wonderful"
,,a must see place,5.0,,it was one of the most beautiful and amazing places i've ever seen. the plants the flowers the artificial waterfall it's something you will never forget. loved it it was like paradise.
,,Singapore and visitors be proud of the this world class attraction,5.0,,"An amazing and tranquil place. The structure that allows the different levels to display their best replication of the plants, flowers and trees. The rainforest effects, waterfalls, fine mist clouds all add to the soothing experience. Allow plenty of time to stop and enjoy each level, and the unexpected/surprising views around each corner. We will certainly be returning for a second visit next time."
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,This is a must see in Singapore. The concept and design are incredible. The Gardens by the Bay as a whole deserve at least half a day of your time. It is a very short taxi ride from the city centre and you find yourself in another world.
,,Expensive but worth the visit,4.0,,"This is an amazing achievement of both gardening and architecture. I was waiting for a pterodactyl to fly past, it wouldn't have seemed out of place at all. Well worth the price a visit."
,,Loved the experience,5.0,,Loved everything. Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy. A lot of people sped past the waterfall with out seeing some exquisite specimens. Something of interest at every turn. A must for any enthusiastic photographer or gardeners. Good views through the dome of Singapore skyline.
,,Worth ever penny...,5.0,,"This is amazing. It really does make you sit back in awe and just take it all it. The gardens are beautiful, the waterfall, the walk. The power of the waterfall really does make you realise the power of water in the rainforest. The beautiful message at the end makes you want to get home and become sustainable, as soon as possible! Great for all ages. :-)"
,,Real life Avatar!,5.0,,"Walking through the Cloud Forest was like walking into another world. The coolness also provides much needed respite from the heat and humidity of Singapore. I had a great time climbing up and up, and didn't really want to leave but also really wanted to watch the Garden Rhapsody sound and light show (also highly recommended). Look here for more details and photos: https://travellingomnomnivore.wordpress.com/2014/10/11/gardens-by-the-bay-singapore/"
,,Nice experience!,4.0,,"If you are a flora and fauna fan, then this is a trip you cant miss. Its a beautifully planned layout. The temperature inside is well maintained. Decent photo opportunities. They also have a floor dedicated to stalagmite and stalactite display. Everything is neatly labelled so its pretty informative too. There are elevators/ escalators available, but there is little bit of upside walking involved - But worth it!"
,,Unreal!!,5.0,,This is part of the gardens by the Bay - it costs to enter but well worth it. It is nice to feel the cool mist on your hot body from the waterfall - great views of Singapore from the top of the work-way on level three - many beautiful plants and flowers. You need to see it to believe it!!
,,Loved being greeted by the waterfall at entrance!,5.0,,"Visit to Cloud Forest Dome is one of the highlights of my short trip. I really love the waterfall, the cool-moist it produces, the beautiful plants surrounding it. Those without acrophobia or fear of heights would enjoy the cloud walk on level 7. I am not a flower person, so I really prefer Cloud Forest to Flower Dome. It's a beautiful place to be!"
,,Manicured!,3.0,,"It's beautiful, but i would not like to visit it again. just doesn't seem natural to see all that in an enclosed area."
,,1 Visit is enough,3.0,,"If you live in a tropical country might as well skip this one.
Upon entrance you'll see a man made falls (be careful you might slip and get wet because of the moist and water). After that you'll see wild and tropical plants and flower. You can take the elevator going up then escalator going down but take note that every floor has something to offer like the secret garden, walkway, the crystals etc. On your way out take some time to watch the show."
,,Just the best,5.0,,"If, you can only do one of the two Gardens in the Bay atractions do the Cloud Forest dome. Especially liked the model bavarian village"
,,Lovely dome,5.0,,I am not a lover of plants but this place caught my fancy. Very nice landscape and arrangement. Nice place for photo ops.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,This came recommend and really enjoyed it. The layout of the place and the different plants was brill. The waterfall is good and learning how the whole Gardens by The Bay works with the Solar Trees and Eco System. Cost was $16 SGD just for the Cloud but worth it with plenty of photo opportunities. A new additional is the model train with village.
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"We saw the dome in a documentary and were excited to see it. We probably had very high expectations as a result and whilst it was nice, it was a bit of a walk to get to it and it was extremely hot that day."
,,If you like plants worth a trip,3.0,,This is a neat thing to see. A huge rain forest in a hot humid city. Some beautiful flowers and plants but your in an out in not that long.
,,different experiance,3.0,,"This is a huge dome with an artificial hill with a water fall inside the dome.It was a different experience,as there is not much to see in Singapore so one can visit and have different experience of art ."
,,Awesome man made forest !,4.0,,"3rd visit to the Cloud Forest Dome on Sunday 12 Oct 2014 .
This is one of 2 Domes here , beside the Flower Dome.
Entrance fee was SGD 28 for both dome ,for foreigners ,Singaporean pay SGD 20.Family plan ticket and membership ticket are available.
Stunning man made waterfall, skywalk , pleasant, cool and humid environment.Has a lift to bring you up to the 7th floor , then descent to floors below.There's a stalagmite and stalagtite display on one of the floor and a theater.Spectacular view inside out ,in this sophisticated mand made climate controlled environment.Worth a visit !!"
,,Pretty good,4.0,,"Thought I would be bored in here, but the huge range of different plants and flowers certainly made it worthwhile"
,,AWESOME!!!,5.0,,"I had no idea this was part of Gardens by the Bay. An amazing array of plants, water features and sky high walking. Very educational as well and nice to take a break from the hot sun as this is indoors and has A/C. The crystal display was an added BONUS. Check it out."
,,Very Nice & Must visit once,4.0,,"Called Gardens by the Bay.
Nicely constructed and it is a beauty for nature lovers.
There is a fee for the entry but outside viewing is free.
OCBC Skywalk on the Super Trees is nice with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the background.
Light show is around 8 PM."
,,Stunning manmade creation,5.0,,Stunning manmade creation. Loved the waterfall and the spray effect. The stairs and elevators that lead to the top has spectacular views of the entire cloud forest.
,,Head in the Clouds - Feet on the Ground,5.0,,Great experience of a rain forest in a covered dome - unexpectedly cool for a glass house in Singapore! Visit the basement 'climate change' timeline - whether you accept the 'Global Warming' doomsday scenario or not - it is thought provoking. Well worth the money to visit and walk down from floor 7
,,Amazing and convenient,5.0,,"A giant greenhouse full of orchids, ferns, and cloud forest species displayed in a unique structure that includes walkways - nicely misted and airconditioned. Easy to get there via the subway - Bayfront stop. And after exiting the well-signed mirrored hallway where families are taking fotos of themselves and each other , there is an electric shuttle that takes you the ticket office at the entrance. The garden itself is free and has some strange giant metal flowers that fit with the strange buildings around the park."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is amazing, its a walk that leads you upwards, climbing to the top of the dome observing the orchid garden. On the way up you encounter spray jets releasing water mist which keeps the temperature cool inside the dome. It rained the day I went, I suggest taking a cardigan or shawl for protection. I was shivering in a t-shirt. I went through both domes and really enjoyed the experience. I have never seen anything like this and think its very unique."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We visited both the flower dome as well and really enjoyed it. It is very well done and lovely and cool inside. The plants and displays are beautiful especially the indoor waterfall. Well worth a visit
,,clouds,5.0,,brilliant definetly worth seeing. Very cooling after a very hot humid day. Easily accessible for people with strollers or wheelchairs.
,,Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,Cold place to visit. Walking in the Dome is a completely different experience. You need to experience it yourself.
,,More like it,4.0,,Take your time and stroll around this amazing structure. Places like this are the reason I keep coming back to Singapore. Always something new to see.
,,fantastic!,5.0,,creatively done. i learned quite a bit in this dome. took a lot of interesting pictures. inspiring and visually beautiful. nice way to cool off at the end of the day being outdoors all day.
,,One to put on your to-do list,5.0,,"From man-made waterfalls to manicured gardens and ponds, it was a beautiful experience. The sky-high 'lost world' walkway was amazing but frightening for someone like me who dislikes heights - but I did it and survived!! Beautiful flowering plants, love the garden walls. Nice, cool escape from the humidity outside."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,There is only one word for the wonderful Cloud Forest Dome and that is fantastic. I will certainly be going back next time we are in Singapore. Only the Singaporeans could build a dome of rainforest with all its beauty within the Botanical Gardens.
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"It is a fantastic concept that has been executed brilliantly. The first thing that you see is the artificial waterfall where you can go and get soaked if you wish (but since it is completely air-conditioned, not a very bright idea). There is a lift to reach to the top floor from where you get fantastic views of Singapore. And when you walk down the path, it almost feels like you are walking down through the mountain path. This is a fantastic attraction and well worth visiting when in Singapore."
,,Excellent forest,5.0,,"The waterfall is great. You can find a little bit of fog there. Lift is provided to reach at the top. As I walk down the path, it feels like I'm walking down through the mountain path."
,,Amazing and a must see,5.0,,"Mind blowing the imagination and dollars that went into this project is almost unbelievable.i visit gardens all over the wold ,I have just come from HRH the Prince of Wales Garden Highgrove in the UK but this Cloud Dome and Flower Dome are worth the trip to Singapore alone"
,,Indoor Waterfall + much more,5.0,,"Was really looking forward to this and it did not disappoint.

Firstly it is one of the few ""outdoor"" places in Singapore when you almost feel cold due to the waterfall and the mist.

Take the lifts to the various levels including waterfall view platform, marina bay view platform, the little model railway and the ponds and plants at the top. all along the walk way up there are plants, sculpture carvings and things of interest.

In the middle on level 4 is the stelignites and fossil display."
,,Man made forest,3.0,,"It is astonishing to see a man made rain forest in its natural condition. But myself being to lot of forest trips, it was not appealing to me. Will enjoy if you have not experienced the natural forests."
,,"Was not going to, but glad I did!",5.0,,Go there and just enjoy the walk! It will brighten your soul and make you smile! The waterfall is cooling and refreshing and the plants are just magnificent!
,,Not so exciting,2.0,,Not so exciting. Good for nature lovers. Good for taking photographs. But difficult to go by MRT. You need to take taxi always
,,Amazing,4.0,,A little dubious at first but was worth the entry fee to see this man made wonder - a nice cool hour spent wandering around
,,Priceless,5.0,,This was an amazing place to visit a must if in Singapore. Stunning floral displays water fall and walks are breath taking. It's nice and cool inside there so you can spend hours in this stunning place and keep cool.
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,An amazing resource for school excursions so avoid those times... but this is really worth seeing. So well done! Almost a little sad to think that maybe this will be the only living example of all this in years to come - hope not. The Flower Dome is great too plus the Super Trees. Make a day of it.
,,Amazing,4.0,,liked about beautifull flower and water fall. disliked about no directions to get into the garden by the bay
,,could not visit with a ticket...,1.0,,"They use tear-off ticket, i.e. one cloud forest dome ticket and one flower dome ticket is attached together.
i went to flower dome in the evening and wasn't reminded that i should go to the cloud forest dome at the same day...
ok....there was tiny reminder on the ticket..."
,,Singapore does attractions well,5.0,,"My husband visited in the early evening when crowds were easing off, and we consequently found it very easy to get around. Amazing displays, especially the waterfall and plants."
,,Well worth the money,5.0,,"An amazing structure which is home to a huge range of plant life. We spent over an hour wandering around, looking at some beautiful flowers and learning about their habitats. The dome is also lovely and cool - a real respite from the heat outside.

We thought $$28 was rather pricey at first (also includes the Flower Dome, which we found a little less impressive) - but after visiting, we felt was definitely worth the money."
,,Def recommend a visit,5.0,,"Cloud forest dome brilliant for all ages, we loved it. Very clever design of lots of different floors, really interesting. Be prepared for the waterfall as you enter!"
,,Excellent design,5.0,,Really enjoyable trip highlight of my Singapore visit. Very good shuttle from the MRT makes getting there easy.
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,"Beautiful and green. I loved walking through the cloud forest dome, exploring all the different flora and also learning a lot about natural alpine regions and the natural environment. Very beautiful and very educational if you stop to read all the signs"
,,Wow...must see...!!,5.0,,"What a morning we had exploring the Cloud Forest. It is so well done and such an interesting place to see, even my 2 teenagers were gobsmacked at how special it was."
,,Cloud Forest,5.0,,A fantastic experience. The variety of plants and whole walls just covered in orchids blew us away. We loved the variety of flowers and other plants was great. The peacock displays were spectacular.
,,Enjoyable attraction,5.0,,"Had a great time here. Visited late afternoon and took lots of photographs then went to the flower dome. If you get your hand stamped when you leave you can go back in when it's dark and experience it in a different atmosphere. When you enter there is a large waterfall. You take the lift up then walk round and down taking it all the plants as if you are in the canopy of the jungle. One word of warning, if you don't like heights this may not be for you , as one of our party suffers from vertigo and had to go back down in the life. A great attraction and well worth a visit."
,,Amazing garden and building!,5.0,,"We enjoyed a morning at the cloud forest and nearby park, The dome is quite a structure and the plants and walkways are great. Well worth a visit!"
,,Amazing attraction. Must see!,5.0,,"Amazing visual attraction that also contains a wealth of scientific information.

The Cloud Forest Dome showcases the environment found at the tops of mountains. It displays stunning endemic plant species from these areas and outlines why the areas are worth your attention/preservation. I saw more carnivorous plants inside the dome than I will likely ever see again. The adventure finishes with a look inside cave formations and a 10 minute video that hypothesizes the effect of global warming over the next 100 years. Combined with the cool 22 degrees inside the dome, it was a great escape from the hot sun outside. The dome also provides some neat picture angles of the Marina Bay Sands, Marina, and Gardens due to its height!

Tip: The Gardens by the Bay website and ticket counters do not advertise it, but you can purchase a single dome ticket for non-residents at $16 SGD."
,,Good,4.0,,Good enjoyed it. Its amazing. We went there in the evening after work and spent an hour inside. Overall its great and hard work by the team to maintain.
,,Great Experience!,5.0,,"The cloud forest is amazing, especially the waterfall. We had no idea what the Gardens by the Bay was all about. We just went to kill some time. It was really nice."
,,Beautifuk,4.0,,"My husband and I visited Gardens by the bay at night and did the Cloud Forest Dome. We took the elevator up to the top floor then made our way down (much easier!). The waterfall at the entrance is amazing, as is walking amongst the tree tops! The dome is a lovely 22 degrees so provides relief from the hot afternoon sun."
,,impressive,4.0,,"a nice mixt of a lot of natural specimen, well organized in a strict environnement.....Maybe lack of spontaneous....Maybe we have to wait the natural developpement of this new attraction. Easy when it's rainy weather"
,,Not for european,3.0,,"The dome recreates the climate of a mountain. For people coming from countries with mountains it doesn't make much sense. It's quite cold inside, in case you want to carry babies consider to bring an extra blanket!"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Beautiful scenery. Stunning flowers great walking along high walkways. Wonderful for flower and garden lovers reasonably priced. Educational and thought provoking for lovers of the environment. Teenagers would rather be in Hotel pool. So consider which children you take some will love it teenage boys will be a little bored and want to walk through quickly. For everyone else a must see.
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,Ok price to get in. Been there a couple of times. Spectacular concept ... waterfall is cool! So many orchids!
,,"Excellent, Superb. a Must see for everyone",5.0,,"A superbly maintained and beautiful facility. The sight of an indoor waterfall energizes you the moment you enter it. the long winding road tot he top is filled with various plant and flowers and other interesting things. This place had more orchids in bloom than the Orchid Garden, Tip:Take the elevator to the top floor and then walk down: easy on the legs."
,,Aussie Eileen,5.0,,"This attractions was outstanding. Well worth the money. We spent several hours there and loved it. I suggest you visit around 1500 hrs, so you can stay for the laser show at 1945 hrs. Walking around all of the gardens was great."
,,Vey relaxing,5.0,,Enjoy our time here very much. The atmosphere was so relaxing and amazing. Many kids come here but also adults. It is quite difficult to find a place like this in SGP. Just visit it if you have time!
,,Very Unique Attraction,5.0,,"An huge indoor waterfall, tropical cloud forest plants, and an interesting walk all indoors in air conditioning! We loved it."
,,A must visit,5.0,,Our second visit to the dome. It has been a while since we were here last and all the foliage has grown and changed the experiance.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,It's amazing what they have done with the Gardens by the Bay and the magnificent Domes. Kids and adults found this fun and intriguing

,,Would definitely recommend,5.0,,"brilliant, was not sure that it would be for me but tagged along with friends, well can only say do not miss it. Also the roof top bar is awsum."
,,good experience,4.0,,"One of the two domes in Garden by the bay, cloud forest dome is a seven storeyed dome which has elevators ,escalators and ramps ,one can cover all the seven floors by the mode most convinent to you. You are welcomed by a huge waterfall from the top floor the moment you enter the dome. each floor is unique in itself , seeing the flora and fauna is a good experience.leaving it to the pictures to describe the beauty of the place"
,,Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,I never get sick of seeing the Cloud Forest and I usually go at least every two to three months when my friends visit Singapore. Even the men are impressed with the Cloud as the architecture of the building is amazing not to mention the rain forest plants growing all over the mountain. If you come to Singapore this is a must on your list to see.
,,refreshing,5.0,,yes! after going around at gardens by the bay this is where u wud want to end ur day. inside is way cooler n refreshing. had been there probably 3 times n can go again any time :-)
,,Something you shouldn't miss!,4.0,,I liked everything about it except that we were there by 6pm and some of the areas were not so well lit. I would have loved to have more light around the cloud bridge or the sky bridge (was it?) the stalactites and stalagmites i think were out of the whole theme of sustainability and wildlife preservation...why are they there? I just didn't get it. Some areas that were wet because of the fountain were a bit slippery so be careful..bring a jacket or a sweater..it is a bit cold inside! :)
,,amazing place,5.0,,waterfall is stunning and it all transports you into a different world really. set aside one hour for each dome at least
,,Lovely park indeed!,5.0,,A very lovely park and a romantic place. I super like the waterfalls. This place is good for strolling. Structure is truly amazing!
,,A brilliant one of a kind attraction,5.0,,"The tall glass done, an internal structure which simulates a hill complete with water falls, controlled environment akin to elevated tropical rain forests and an outstanding range of rain-forest vegetation makes this garden a truly one of a kind attraction."
,,"A ""must see""",5.0,,"The only mistake I made was visiting the Cloud Forest Dome first and the Flower Dome second. CFD is a mind-blowing feat of engineering and I took dozens of photos as I went from the ground level to the very top. The most amazing plants and flowers, all looking as though they have grown naturally and have always existed in this wonderful environment."
,,Cloud Forest's Awesome Height,4.0,,I was holding on to the rails most of the time I think. It's both scary and exhilarating! Very cool!
,,Unique park,4.0,,"A very special park, nice atmosphere, the waterfall was very good I enjoyed walking along the trail of the waterfall so much."
,,Put this on your must-see list,5.0,,"Virtually every time I am in Singapore it is for business. But this trip had a built-in day off.

So I went to visit the Cloud Forest Dome, having read about it.

Aside from the fact that it is an amazing dome, located in the one of the most tropical cities on Earth, this structure is truly amazing.

As you meander up through the ""mountain"" mist you see hundreds of varieties of unusual plants, flowers and vines.

The experience is tranquil and invigorating at the same time.

To exit, you travel through a world warming command center that flashes statistics (number of active fires; 10,000 a day e.g.), rate of ice melt and so on.

While troubling, you cannot help but be impressed with the care taken to make this unique exhibit interesting and informative.

Clearly worth your time and conveniently located near the Marina district."
,,Welcome cool and something v different,5.0,,If you are in any way into nature you will love this place. Not only is it a respite from the heat but also the most amazing views on Singapore from a natural environmnt
,,nice and cool,4.0,,very nice botanical dome with nice flowers and it was very nice and cool in temperature. I liked the flowers and the fact that you could be so close to them. That you could take very nice pictures.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,This place is perfect and highly recommended for a family dayout. The picturesque surrounding is very nice for photography.
,,gardens up high,4.0,,"Upon entering this dome, you will be welcomed by a giant waterfall with very cold water flowing down. You'll get a little bit of the splashes but it's all nice considering the hot weather outside. From the ground floor, you'll ride the lift up to the top most part of the dome and work your way down, enjoying the view and different kinds of plants.It's a nice way to spend the noon hours. About an hour or two is enough to see and appreciate this place :) and the +5 degree show on the basement part is a good way to end the tour here. This short film viewing will definitely make you more conscious on why we should take care of our environment better."
,,Magic respite from heat and humidity,5.0,,"This is a super facility in gardens by the bay, with the worlds largest indoor water fall. You ascend up a walkway, then take a lift to the top of the world section and meander down, taking in the sights and delights of the indoor rainforest environment. The plants are spectacular and information panels explain some of the features, but if you want to learn about the plants, best to take the audio headset. Finish in a convenient gift shop of course!"
,,The seven story waterfall was amazing,5.0,,On each level there was something worth seeing including the most beautiful assortment of flowering plants. We had never seen anything like it.
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,"This is an incredible attraction, especially for plant lovers. So well done, and there is so much to do there. A must do in Singapore!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"A man made mountain with a giant waterfall and tropical garden, take the lift up and slowly walk down, a great experience particularly in the dark."
,,Beautiful setup,4.0,,"After a walk through the park, this is the perfect refreshment, its a pleasant change of temperature.

The dome has a structual core covered in beauty, there is a lot to see and learn from bottom till top and back.

Shouldnt be spoiling to much but its a good impression of a high forest envirionment with nice trees and plants."
,,Welcome relief from a humid day,5.0,,Upon entering you are hit with the wow factor of a huge waterfall and the cooling spray. Went with a 7 yr old who really enjoyed the atmosphere and the educational aspects which looks at the effect of temperature rise and how it may affect this planet.
,,The future now - both entertaining and educational,5.0,,Like everything in this glorious city it was perfect! Was walking and I just wished I had more time. The air conditioned environment was a welcome relief from the outside walk!
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning. Such a joy to visit. A lovely breeze greets you as you enter which is a joyous relief from the Singaporean humidity. The mountain is amazing and easily accessible for all types of people no matter what fitness level or mobility.
My children loved the educational aspect at the end if our walk. Highly recommend"
,,So refreshing,5.0,,"Amazing example of how man can change his environment, well worth a visit if only to get out of the humidity for a break ... Stunning structure that needs to be seen to be believed"
,,Enchanting!,4.0,,"The waterfall is amazing! Cold water, breeze, exotic plants Im afraid of heights, so climbing the stairs and walking the bridges really gives me goosebumps! Ill definitely gonna visit and try it again"
,,Nature Enclosed in A Dome,5.0,,"Cloud Forest is to be seen to believe how a Dome can depict Flora & Fauna at various altitudes so reallistically . There is a winding ramp taking you from caves /sea level to snow covered mountains with depictions of characteristics of those places . Plants are real & Fauna is shown by models. Explanations are very well done & one can understand & appreciate as if one is up in those places .Lifts are available for those not able to walk up on ramp.

Weather is controlled inside the Dome mainly by temperature & humidity control ."
,,Unique,5.0,,"I found it incredible.
It was so nice to actually see a cloud forest. They must spend a lot to create the external conditions in order the plants to grow. They told me that it's getting bigger and bigger by the month, so the later you go the more advanced it will be.
As you step in there is a big waterfall and a trail to follow around the ""greenhouse dome"". At every little there are signs telling a lot of informations about the forest and the habitats, the plants.
There is also a bit of video presentation that tells you about the raising of the temperature of the planet and the effects that it has, on a really big screen.
I definitely recommend it."
,,Unbelievable...must visit for all!,5.0,,"A tropical forest mountain covered with fog, mist, clouds, flowers & trees and all of that inside a dome! And that's not all. There is a 10+ storey high mesmerizing waterfall that welcomes you as you enter. There are 7 storeys on the mountain which are accessible via escalators/stairs/elevators with each storey hosting a different theme. As you near the exit of the dome, there is a very nice short film on effects of global warming which uses the wall and the floor as a medium for projection.

An amazing experience overall. Everyone visiting Singapore should certainly have this on their itinerary.

Photography tips: Carry your ultra-wide lenses. Tripod is needed if you plan to visit the dome after sunset since the lighting is kept low to create that forest-like feel."
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,"Brilliant, stunning plants, typically Singapore organisation and presentation. Loved it all. The walkways above the plants and trees was great for viewing from a different angle. Also cooler in here than outside!"
,,Beutiful,5.0,,I liked the design and the huge number of species. very nicely organized and unique. really beutifull.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This feature and the flower dome are ttruly amazing and so well thought out and displayed. My husband is disabled and we managed to negotiate all the areas with his wheelchair. We will definately visit again and would recommend it to anyone.
,,Unique experience,4.0,,Cloud forest is part of the gardens by the bay for which you need to buy separate ticket. The artificial water falls at the entrance is very nice and the tree top is walk is very fun.
,,Cooling Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Upon entering Cloud Forest you will enjoy cool breeze from The Falls. You will feel instantly comforting to have cold air around you despite having to walk in a humid weather in Singapore. A tons of varieties of plants and the tall landscape, different areas of explorations to explore."
,,Rainforest in a dome,5.0,,We visited this alongside the gardens by the bay. This is not to be missed! As experienced rainforest travellers we thought this representation was brilliant.
,,Green tranquility in an urban landscape,5.0,,"This place is wonderful. Even if you don't consider yourself a flower and fauna fan, you'll love the peaceful and beautiful surroundings. Don't worry about it being too hot in a humid climate; it's more temperate than the outside!"
,,Ctct8,3.0,,Five vicky gift is just tut cage city in Citigroup It it vicky it up cig up u it clydebank t t tying 7 it fit it It Ctct8 t it tech Uig I to it t g t t g t g u I I it it I g u ucug
,,New spot,5.0,,"The idea of the dome is good, just a bit expensive. As it is new, it is still worth to visit. We have spent nearly 4 hr to visit the domes and the park."
,,Breathtakingly refreshing,5.0,,"Walking through the cloud dome reminded me of the reichstag building dome in Berlin, at the same time in was taken back to the feeling of being at the Victoria falls in Zimbabwe. The backdrop of the the Singapore flyer reminded me of the London eye. I fled like I could sail away in the backdrop of the marina bay sands building. All in all it's amazing how one place can provoke such meomories."
,,what an experience,5.0,,The cloud domes a great experience. This was visited as part of a Singapore Airline stopover program and was time well spent.
,,Fantastic Place...,5.0,,"We went there at night, even though it was fabulous like you're dreaming! The walking on the bridges around that big trunk of plants was very nice. You have to visit this place."
,,Second trip,5.0,,"We love this place, the plants and flowers are just so spectacular it's a regular visit for us. We will be back for a third visit next year. Love it"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The Gardens By the Bay are well worth a visit. Be prepared to get damp passing the huge waterfall in the Cloud Forest Dome. Very clever exhibit. You feel as if you are above the clouds.
Flower Dome also worth a visit - orchids are amazing!"
,,Worth seeing if you have a couple hours spare in Sing,4.0,,Great concept and really interesting place. The information boards are great and really add to the experience. Mid week is a great time to visit when it's not too busy
,,Amazing forest,5.0,,"The forest dome was a lovely experience, once I reached the area at gardens by the bay it was pleasant with easy access and directions, the forest has indoor lighting for night visitors, and inside weather is controlled a bit cold, i would suggest to bring a long sleeve shirt along, I enjoyed the waterfall and hanging walking bridges up high."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,I really enjoyed walking around the Cloud Forest Dome which was a little oasis on a warm Singapore day.
,,A must see in Singapore,4.0,,It is really peaceful and relaxing and awesome flowers must see the price is 16 person lots to see Nd enjoy
,,amazing,5.0,,"This place was breath taking I would highly recommmend, go early its not very busy then. Really enjoyable"
,,Wonderful Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,Wonderful cool waterfall. Beautiful plants from all over the world. Kids really loved it. Definitely worth a visit
,,A wonderful relief from the heat,5.0,,"Great concept the water fall when you first walk in is amazing the flowers are wonderful, so many beautiful orchards and rare flowers. Very informative as well about the environment. The platform walks are lovely."
,,Wow,4.0,,"Amazing flower show never seen anything like it, a must see worth paying $24 to go for a look even the husband was impressed."
,,Out of this world forest,5.0,,This is located in Gardens by the Bay and is wonderful with the waterfall in the entrance. There is so much to see in this forest and it definitely drops in temperature. Note that it will probably take an hour or two to see all of the Cloud Forest. Would recommend to all as there are beautiful flowers and greenery.
,,"Awesome experience! The moment you walked in, you were pleasantly surprised with a welcome from the huge waterfall.",5.0,,"It seems that I am in another place, like rainforest. Despite the hot Singapore weather, it feels cool and misty. It's a nice walk about to escape the city."
,,Nice back to nature atmosphere,5.0,,The climate control of this facility makes this place even more enjoyable and interesting. It had quite an abundance of information about the various plants and its relationship with the environment. This attraction is not only entertaining but informative to everyone especially the young. It helps make them aware the importance of the ecology of nature in relation to humans.
,,Waterfall is impressive,4.0,,Ok experience and interesting but wouldn't rush to do it again. Indoor waterfall was impressive. Those who appreciate plants would find this a great attraction.
,,Something Different,4.0,,"It felt great to get out of the heat and enjoy a tropical paradise in the middle of the city. We took the head phone tour and if you are into plants or maybe not into plants, it was very informative and interesting. I would recommend the 1.5 hour tour (with headphones) and definitely bring your camera."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Singapore never fails to amaze me!.... creating a cloud forest in the middle of an international city. I actually visited this with my cousin who is an architect & she made me appreciate the place more as she made me understand the what it takes to build someting like that. We visited at night and caught the light show as well. Loved the areas of the walkway where it juts out & you feel like you are just walking on air... ...I enjoyed it which is surprising as I have a fear of heights..... :)
,,An oasis on a warm day.,4.0,,I was reluctant to pay to enter this attraction as I am not a fan of plants or gardens in general. We decided to go in to give our kids a break from the heat of the day. I was so impressed to enter and feel the cool spray from the enormous indoor waterfall. The whole place is amazing even if you don't enjoy gardens. The walkways amongst the plants give an amazing view of the gardens. Our kids loved exploring & we had no trouble getting around with a stroller. Definitely worth a look.
,,A different world,5.0,,Just a couple of minutes walk from the Marina Bay the cloud forest dome is a great piece of architecture as well as from inside as from the outside. Climbing to the top of the waterfall gives you beautiful views over the flowers inside and the city outside.
,,Cloud Dome Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Just loved the plants and watering systems. It would be exceptional at night before it closes at 9:00pm. From up high you would be able to see all the lights within the gardens, including the tree lamps and city lights"
,,Wow,4.0,,Loved this! Was very impressed! Loved the view from the walkways. If you don't like heights then you may not enjoy walking on the walkways
,,Unique and interesting,5.0,,"Between the 2 domes, this is my favorite.
It can get a little cool and wet at the entrance [bottom of falls]

The walk up and plants are interesting and it was a good enjoyable walk round the attraction.

Remember to spend some time outdoors too, as its a nice walk / stroll when the weather's not too hot."
,,Head in the Clouds,5.0,,"It's amazing what humans can achieve, creating a cloud forest in the middle of an international city. Spectacular horticulture and architecture. We visited at night and caught the light show as well. Knees were a little weak in some areas of the walkway...people with vertigo might not like it as much as we did."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We really liked the whole thing and spent 2 hours enjoying the flowers , and plants from around the world, the displays, the artworks scattered about"
,,So clever - a must see,5.0,,"This is unlike any other winter garden or summerhouse. This domed, man-made garden reaching high into the air with walk ways to look below is stunning. If you are in the Marina Bay Sands area make sure to set aside an hour or two, to walk around the garden area below the Trees."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"An interesting place to visit but as I expected, I didn't see much cloud. It was cold though and suggested to have something good to wear. The entrance fees :( - not really good to pay that much."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"The Cloud Dome was interesting as were the whole of Marina Bay Gardens, it was cheaper to buy a ticket to both of the Domes at the same time."
,,Eco magic spectacular.,5.0,,Allow at least half a day to enjoy the Gardens of the Bay if your time is limited. We didn't see everything but was there 4 hours and saw major attractions. Could see so much more in a day. The other areas are free so you can go back at any time. Totally recommend this. Flower Dome. The orchid displays are jaw dropping. The cacti areas so varied and the Australian garden makes you feel at home knowing the plants. The Cloud Dome is amazing. So much to see and the Eco message worthwhile. The Cloud dome & Flower Dome & skywalk is a fee.
,,Cool and exciting,5.0,,"the concept was very nice...it's like an indoor forest with urban touch. aqside from walking, around is very friendly since offers various modes of lifts also."
,,Love this place!,5.0,,Whoever thought of this idea should be given a medal. The dome is absolutely stunning - and all those plants are truly amazing. Love the waterfall!
,,A must visit,5.0,,I absolutely loved the Cloud Forest Dome at Gardens by the bay. It is a refreshing spot in contrast to the warm and humid Singapore climate. Great for people of all ages
,,Magical,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome is one of two domes at Gardens by the Bay. The other one was the Flower dome which has lots of different flowers from the Mediterranean, but as my husband has pollen allergies, we decided to go to the Cloud Forest Dome. There's a beautiful waterfall as you walk into the dome and the whole place is filled with amazing tropical flora, with a concentration on those from the South America region. I was especially amazed by all the different varieties of pitcher plants and orchids.

We had a great time and even though we knew nothing about botany or had any interest in plants, we were completely blown away by the beauty of the place. It was a little cold so I would recommend bringing a light jumper. It is a very easy walk and even our little 9 month old enjoyed gazing at all the different colours and plants.

For parents, there are lots of changing rooms and nursing rooms outside the dome and also inside the dome so there's no need to worry about dirty diapers :)

It's definitely worth the visit whether it's hot or rainy outside."
,,Wonderful place ! Loved it,5.0,,It was so beautiful. Never thought cloud dome would be so beautiful especially the water falls. Well maintained. Loved the place and my little one loved it too.
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"Unfortunately one dome was closed for works, otherwise it would have been better. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our visit tremendously."
,,Gardens By the Bay,4.0,,A nice place for the whole family to visit and explore plants and trees from around the world in a controlled atmosphere.
,,A fantastic tropical garden,5.0,,"What a brilliant place! I was totally taken away with this amazing tropical rainforest in an enormous dome. A truly amazing engineering feat. I would reckon you to see this on your trip to Singapore. And it's companion flower dome. Well worth the visit, especially for the plant lovers and gardeners."
,,Impressive,5.0,,I had never seen anything like it in Europe and it is definitely worth seeing just to get an idea of the scale things are built in SGP. An enjoyable evening.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,A very imaginative design! The skywalk is fantastic. Allow at least 2hrs for one dome if you love nature and plant.
,,Truly amazing,5.0,,"I wasnt sure what to expect from the cloud dome-but once we entered we were blown away. the architecture, the botanical installation the indoor waterfall -completely exceeded my expectaions... And the kids loved it tooo. Do not leave Singapore without a visit to the cloud dome!"
,,Interesting plant selections,3.0,,"Enjoyable pace, lots of photo opportunity, nice relaxing break to the other tours in the area. Requires ability to walk up gradual slope and it is wet, so good footwear as it was slippery in some areas"
,,The waterfall,5.0,,What an amazing place. You don't want to be scared of heights. beware when entering of the wet concrete floors. well worth it
,,Amazing environment,5.0,,The two domes are well worth a visit. If you are interested in plants you will get a lot of pleasure from seeing the different environments all fitted into either the forest dome or the flower dome. It is quite an adventure to walk around these domes at night.
,,Cloud dome,5.0,,Waterfall absolutely breath taking make sure you allow enough time a couple of hours in air-conditioning is easy to enjoy in singapore
,,Wow,5.0,,"Entering these domes feels like you are entering another planet. How well everything is set up, is amazing. I will definitely be taking my family there soon. Avatar like!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"So lovely to see all types of garden in one place. If you're a garden lover, must visit this place. This is in gardens by the bay. Both Cloud Forest Dome and Waterfall is a nice place to visit."
,,"Chilly, Futuristic and out of this world",4.0,,Great way to cool off when you are in Singapore. It gives you the sense that we have finally arrived into the long awaited future
,,coolness personified,5.0,,"The coolness hits you as you enter out of the heat.The waterfall as you enter is amazing, and the st up of vertical gardens are wonderful.And the range of plants beautiful"
,,Very artificial...,3.0,,"The visit to the Cloud Forest Dome was strange. The structure itself is very interesing and the Cloud Forest was very nice to look at.

However, it seems very artifical and I didn't understand the actual meaning of it.

So - to see an artificially installed Cloud Forest, it's a great experience."
,,Great experience.,4.0,,"Takes about an hour, very good wheel chair access, one of a kind walk through Cloud Forest. Very interesting for kids and adults."
,,A must to see,5.0,,"This place is a great place to visit. Tickets will set you back approx $ 26.00 each, however the displays of plants are fantastic. We were glad to see this. Inside the dome is cool, so it was good to cool down from being outside. Allow about an hour to see all the displays within the dome."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"It was hot outside and as soon as the door of the forest opened, I will never forget that moment, extreme gush of cold air brushed mu face. The tall waterfall installation in the cloud forest is amazing, and the lost world walk from the top to bottom makes to feel like a hero in a Jurassic Park movie."
,,"Cool, Pandora in Singapore?",5.0,,"Avatar's Pandora comes to mind in this place. Of the two domes in Gardens By The Bay, this is my favourite. It's much cooler, a respite from the sweltering heat, and the creators of the dome took the rainforest theme to the max. Go way up high and go around the massive waterfall, orchids everywhere, and well-designed exhibits of the unique flora that grows in our climate."
,,A cool place on a hot day.,3.0,,"This attraction was ok. If it's a hot or wet day it would be great because it was freezing inside. If you have some free time and you're in the area it's worth a visit. The best part of the Gardens are the actual gardens themselves, not the paid exhibitions."
,,Good visit,4.0,,Very nice visit as you can find a very different place in hot Singapore. It is a forest and waterfall. Very good experience.
,,Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,"Like the waterfall. And the bridge, its scary but love the view from the top. And at every floor there's always a showcase so its quite educational."
,,Over rated,2.0,,Having read brochures on this attraction I was disappointed when entering. It wasn't quite what I was expecting.
,,Different,4.0,,"The design of the dome is beautiful and interesting, but really just an indoor rain forest. There are lots of beautiful plants and scenery, and the layout is very creative. It was pretty expensive, and if you have kids or tweens they won't be very interested."
,,Dome Forest,5.0,,"First thoughts were ""it's going to be a hothouse in there"", couldn't have been further from the truth. First time I've experienced an air conditioned forest!!! Great access all the way to the top, waterfalls, educational areas, get back to nature in this wonderfully controlled environment."
,,WOW!,5.0,,"Utterly gobsmackingly brilliant. The best and most thrilling thing I have ever visited. Breath taking. innovative, bold and completely ecologically self sustaining."
,,a magical experience,5.0,,"whether you like plants and flowers or not, this is a truly amazing experience that is not to be missed."
,,Stunning,4.0,,"This dome houses a several storey high man-made waterfall and is designed to emulate cool mountain plants. Its a nice reprieve from the humidity outside, and has a walk that takes you around the top of the mountain to view the flora at the top. Not for the faint hearted."
,,I'm not a fan... too fake,3.0,,If you are a first time traveler to Singapore there are so many other more cultural things to see. I would only bother to go if you have time constraints if you are traveling with someone who has mobility issues or needs to be in air conditioning. It's all fake and man-made. There is nothing culturally interesting about this attraction.
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"The moment we enter the dome, it attracted us like anything. Waterfall, greenery, beautiful orchids and breathtaking view from top floor - everything looks so beautiful and close to nature."
,,Amazing misty world,5.0,,It's enchanting and wonderfully-made misty world. Love to go there anytime. Cloud forest flight transports you instantly into equatorial rain-forest.
,,Magical,5.0,,I was absolutely blown away by these gardens! I have never seen any gardens so extravagant. The prices were reasonable and we spent hours walking around and taking many photos! For anyone who appreciates gardens and tiger beauty this is not to be missed!!
,,Loved it,5.0,,It is worth the visit. Not very big probably you can d both dome in 1 or 2 hours. Nice place to get great pictures.
,,Turn the water down please,1.0,,"Yes rain forrest plants need lots of water, but the plants here looked tired and unhealthy in general. I think many are getting just a little too much water, or something else is wrong. In nature, rain forests look more healthy and lush. It needs some horticultural investigation as to why the plants are not at their best. The flower Dome was much better though, so still worth visiting the gardens."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I wasn't expecting the dome to be this good: you enter at the bottom by a man-made waterfall, go up to the top in a lift then gradually walk your way down (lift available for less able-bodied people). Amazing feature."
,,Wonderful experience.,5.0,,"This truly has to be one of the ""wonders"" of Singapore. Your eyes feast on hundreds of exotic plants while you climb around under an amazing dome. The vertical planting us so cleverly done you can't imagine it ever not being there. Fabulous orchids, exotic begonia, pitcher plants to name but a few. With waterfalls, trickling water and pools this has something to entertain the young and old. A wonderful day out."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"What can you say about this magnum opus that has not already been said? A concept both imaginative, brilliant and expensive! Congratulations to Singapore for this. Another challenge To my vertigo!"
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,I would like to spend more time to visit again because of all amazing flowers and plants! Feel so good to be surrounded by all kinds of flowers.
,,Definitely a must,5.0,,"Fabulous place to visit for all ages with areas to explore, plants to see, lovely temperatures on a hot day. It has it all, play areas for kids, flowers, little corners of interest. Great place to explore and really appreciated that they provided education on climate change and the impact on the planet."
,,Urban Greenery!,5.0,,"My mother loves taking photographs of plants. Therefore, this place was pretty much spot on. We were greeted with an artificial waterfall which was a spectacle along with breezy mixture of wind and water-drops. You would feel you were entering some Avatar world rather than being in busy Singapore. The waterfall came out of an artificial mountain like building, covered with exotic plants. It was splendid. We went to the upper level to walk through the floating-like pathways. For those who have fear of heights, you are forewarned. Nevertheless, the experience was lovely and would definitely go back there!"
,,Great concept,5.0,,I like the concept of this. You can enjoy a part of tropical jungle here. Event in the middle of modern city like Singapore :)
,,Nice Waterfall with Virtual Clouds in the Garden,4.0,,Waterfall is superb and damn beautiful.. Went thr in evening time and enjoy the location a lot. prefer to each traveller to visit this place if u r in singapore...not be missed
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"This was really lovely day. 2 large domes a cloud Forest which incorporates an amazing waterfall and then a 2nd zone which is all flowers and plants from around the world. The 2nd dome was not really my thing but it was really well laid out and there were some amazing flowers.

My favourite part was in the Cloud Dome where a video shows what the effects of the world's temperature increasing by 5%. Really eye opening and well worth watching."
,,"An Interesting Place, well worth a visit",5.0,,"It was an enjoyable morning spent at the Cloud Dome. We went by train and then by small tractor train through gardens to Dome, as it is a reasonable walk and very humid. Well presented and interesting. We also did the audio bus tour in the Dome which took us to each section and the information learned was excellent."
,,Amazing - and cool to boot!,5.0,,"Saw both the domes at Gardens By The Bay and even though the flower dome had a fantastic display of orchids, the size and structure of the Cloud Forest Dome was by far my favourite. A marvel of architectural design and great value."
,,No one should miss this.,5.0,,"This is a world class if not world leading exhibit. You don't need to be a flower or plant enthusiast - the setting and ""adventure"" within have something for everyone. The layers of vegetation by altitude, the scenery, the views out of the dome, the water features the pools and waterfalls and the technology behind it are exceptional. Cant say enough about it - just go see it. Best feature of its kind and its at the famed Gardens by the Bay so the adventure continues outside afterward."
,,Must Be Seen,5.0,,This and The Flower House just have to been seen to be believed. The whole Gardens by the Bay complex is wonderful. We found it all to be spectacular!
,,impressive,5.0,,"many information about envirementel,; wunderfull building, arcitecture as well (and a little bit adventure"
,,Tremendous diversity of plant life,5.0,,"Our favorite attraction at Gardens by the Bay. The giant waterfall at the entrance worked well artistically, and was a popular place for photos. We could see a foggy cloud at the top, but it had dissipated by the time we got there. What stood out to me was the tremendous diversity of plant life, reflecting the tremendous creativity of both the Creator and the curator. Plants were growing everywhere, even along the railings. I marveled at the length of the long woody vine along the second level railing, which appeared to be a single vine 100 meters long. I wish there were guided tours, but we only saw an audio tour available."
,,fantastic,5.0,,"The interior is excellent. Otherwise, a new idea of creating such an object type. From the inside you can see through the transparent walls of the other attractions in the area. I highly recommend viewing. Perhaps the ticket price is a little high."
,,WOW garden lovers delight!!!,5.0,,"magnificent! We arrived the last day of the festival Gardens by the Bay ,With 3 friends from the Camden garden Club.. like everything in Singapore well organised,just magnificent, did the sky walk down through the center of the Waterfall, . plants were a dream!!!!!

Singapore has long passed the days of a stopover only, we had 5 days,well done!"
,,A Real Treat,5.0,,What an amazing venue and a must to visit if you are staying in Singapore. The plants and features on view were incredible and the only negative is the global warming issue being pushed in a small area of the environment. Apart from that it is brilliant.
,,Loved the Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,"We visited this on day sightseeing from our Hop On Hop Off bus, it was lovely and also a lovely cool break from the heat outside. I would have loved more time as they had an orchid show on but we wanted to see so many things, but I sill loved it. Very petty."
,,Good experience for those who have not seen Monsoon and rain foests!,4.0,,Nice to see as they have created artificial rain forests and waterfalls. Gives feeling of being in Monsoon and in rain forests. Nice place to hang out with family.
,,worth to see,5.0,,a must see for tourist its definitely something new and worth seeing.Very high tech and something very different from the other tourist attractions
,,Pretty Refreshing Sight,4.0,,"The dome itself doesn't look that good from the outside especially if you're seeing it on an eye level but inside the dome is a bunch of pretty impressive arrangement of a plants and stuff! The city waterfall is an amazing sight and I can say that the creator of this place is very witty as he/she put all together all the good stuff that will really make you feel you're outside the city.

Going around the dome is quite a long walk so be sure to put on a good walking shoes."
,,Awesome modern landscape experience,5.0,,"Giant domes containing amazing plant life, an enormous waterfall, the cloud walk and beautiful landscaped gardens with incredible structures make this an attraction well worth visiting, if you like plants or enjoy marvelling at intricately engineered structures. It's hot though, so take lots of water!"
,,You don't see that everyday!,4.0,,"We went to Garden by the Bay because we were attending Singapore Garden Festival and they bundle the festival admission fee with the tickets to the cloud forest and the flower domes.

The first thing we encountered was the gigantic indoor waterfall flowing from the the top of vegetation covered tower. We were amazed and we were not the only ones. A lot of people stopped and took photos in front of the waterfall which actually caused congestion at the entrance.

As you walked inside you walked into mist and fog as if you walked into a forest high up in a mountain. At the tower and at the side planters you could see many kinds of trees, mosses and plants you would normally see at that kind of habitat like fern trees, wild botanical orchids, begonias, and Nepenthes tropical pitcher plants. You could get up to the top of the tower using a lift and the same lift is also the only way you could get out of the dome so in a busy day you might have to wait for the lift for sometimes

I preferred this dome to the flower dome because for me it's felt more natural than the flower dome and it is something that you don't encounter everyday!"
,,Who Knows,3.0,,Saw it from the outside as in their wisdom the powers to be decided to close it for the day for maintenance. Very disappointing as this was was the main reason we went to the gardens on such a hot day. I don't know it the closures are advertised so I suggest that you check
,,Amazing,5.0,,Even if you are not a garden lover I still would recommend a visit this is an amazing experience with a serious message about looking after our planet.
,,Artificial but amazing,4.0,,It is amazing to build and maintain such a cloud forest though this whole thing is human-built (artificial).
,,it's a must,5.0,,"they put a lot of stuff inside a dome. The stuff is very polite, helpfull and doing a very good job. It's worth visiting on a rainy day, because you need to really enjoy the place, if is sunny you want to stay outside to see the park."
,,better than it looks,5.0,,It doesn't look that much from the outside but it is so impressive and you can get a great view from the top.
,,Forest in the city,5.0,,"This is a must-go place as when you stepped in, you will be amazed by the gigantic city waterfall and the coolness inside the room. The video showing the effect of global warming and the introductory of the cloud forest was just amazing! Highly recommended!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Singapore's answer to future sustainability, an enormous mountain covered in all sorts of amazing plants with waterfalls. As you walk down the mountain, you get to see amazing views of the city as well as the mountain. I highly recommend getting the audio files, they are around £4 per person to hire and are definitely worth it. You hear about the history and importance of this amazing project as well as details about the plants. Our two boys aged 9 and 12 really enjoyed it too."
,,"Wow, how can you follow that!!",5.0,,Having visited the Eden project in Cornwall this complex exceeded all expectations. So many different habitats and ecosystems in a series of domes
,,"Very cool, bring a jumper",4.0,,"I really liked this place, it was like walking through a rainforest but the only issue i had was how freezing it was inside.
Make sure you have something to wear as soon as you get in, especially if you get wet, you will freeze.
Its in stark contrast to Singapores weather so most people are not prepared for how cold it is inside. Then once you are dressed comfortably, you can take your time walking through the dome.
In total i dont think you need more than 30min for this, i recommend you save your time for the Super Trees and the light show (check their website for session times), as thats the big highlight :)"
,,Artificial,3.0,,"This venue offers cool shelter in the heat but is nothing like as good as the Botanical Gardens. Metal walkways and steam do nothing to help the atmosphere. Modern, but disappointing."
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,I really like Gardens by the Bay and the cloud forest dome is well worth visiting. Although it is not as colorful as the flower dome having the opportunity to see plants from various altitudes is quite cool.
,,"Interesting place... lots of screeching ""bats"".....",4.0,,"I gave this place a VERY GOOD solely for the effort put in to create it. I mean it IS very well done up and worth taking a look.

The Cloud Forest was an interesting place to walk about, but like so many touristy places in Singapore, the place was crawling with over-excited screeching tourists. I now have even GREATER respect for my dear father. He is a tour guide specializing in Mandarin-speaking tours and those screeching ""bats"" are what he put up with every single day - rubbing Tiger Balm on my temple… the thought alone is headache-inducing…

Then again I have no time other than a weekend to go visit, so no choice… I'll be a tourist too (minus the screech) and squeeze on... Can get a bit chilly in there though. Do bring a shawl."
,,Awesome surprist,5.0,,"A must see when in Singapore. Catch lift to top and make your way down, you will ooh and aah and the way."
,,Man made marvel,5.0,,The Cloud Forest and Fower Domes are simply engineering marvels transforming you to another temperate zone. I would recommend to book online via the GbyB website to avoid the ticket queues and avoid the weekends when it must get really busy/busier.
,,inventive garden,5.0,,"Both domes are a wonderful invention that allows you to wander amongst lovely plants from around the world beautifully displayed in a way that amazes you and has that wow factor,"
,,Cloud forrest dome,5.0,,an awesome attraction to visit but make sure to stay into the evening and check out the light show of the trees and dinner at satay by the bay.
,,I loved it - stunning,5.0,,Now this actually amazed me. Such lush tropical flora and fauna and the beautiful waterfalls. It was so cool and relaxing to walk around and I mean around as you start at the bottom and ascend this huge spiral structure. The orchids are amazing. The condition of the specimens is excellent. Very informative audio about the work they do. I would highly recommend this.
,,amazing environment!,5.0,,"inside a futuristic structure made of glass and steel, there is this wonderful environment made of trees, bushes, flowers... really a nice experience!"
,,"Waterfall, flora, fauna",5.0,,Loved visiting the cloud forest dome. So much to see. It's amazing to see how a natural forest environment can be created by man. The vertical garden by the waterfall is something I can stare at for a long time. So many plants and the view of the city from inside the dome is interesting.
,,Beautiful and cool respite from the heat.,5.0,,"We went here to escape the oppressive heat -- nice and cool and by the end we had to go outside to warm up again! The dome is educational and informative.

Watch out for the queues: they can be quite long, but do move quickly. You can buy online if you don't want to wait."
,,Made to surprise!!!,5.0,,"Amazing place where botanic meets the future! Artificial trees coming to life at night, skywalking at more than 40 meters from the ground and two really astonishing garden houses! You enter the flower dome and you are captivated, you enter the cloud forrest dome and you are speechless!!! Vertical walls of plants, water falls... Discover the rest!"
,,Awsome,5.0,,"Loved everything about this place, would be great for children to adults, go early in day as it gets busy"
,,A beautiful sight,5.0,,This place is well worth a visit and worth the money. You enter at the bottom by a big waterfall and slowly wind your way up through a rainforest of orchids and tropical plants. The view from the top is wonderful and the plant varieties are interesting and varied. Just the building itself is amazing.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"I loved it. Cool and beautiful and had so many different kind of flora and fauna. Liked it better than the dome of flowers. It looked very lush and random and at the same time I was sure it wasn't random. If you only want to visit one dome in the Gardens By The Bay, choose this one."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,So beautiful and well presented. Lovely and cool to walk into after being out in the heat. The informative video presentation about climate change is so thought provoking. Highly recommend coming here.
,,Cloud brilliance,5.0,,"We expected to do a quick visit to the a Cloud Forest but were so enthralled we stayed on to admire the waterfall, plants, flowers and crystals. The audio visual presentation (+5 degrees) of the potential effects of global warming in this century was well done. A must do when visiting Singapore."
,,"even hot outside, but inside you feel the cold",5.0,,"I think, you do not run as fast as lightning, although you backpackers. why? because the real coolness is you can enjoy the scenery really real in front of you, I am a photographer and adventurous at the same time, so for the future I will be enjoying the situation in here than I have to move quickly. very well suited to vacationing with family, boyfriend, and friends.

warm regard's

,,super,4.0,,"really love this place, so nature and been amazed in almost their whole area,weather so contrast compare with outside the dome, fresh and cold"
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"A must to visit when in Singapore, give yourself plenty of time to see all. Walked here from Chinatown on my first day wish I has come back at night when it is all alight"
,,Sensational,5.0,,"Do it. Beautiful experience and a haven on a hot Singapore day. Great experience, kids would love it."
,,Lovely,4.0,,"Lovely water fall and wide array of plants and trees. Don't miss the +5 degrees and secret garden, nor the tree top bridge walk (though not suitable for those afraid of heights)."
,,Don't regret a missed opportunity.,5.0,,"From the moment you walk into a face full of mist, to the moment you leave, you will be in awe of the sights to behold. As with most Singapore attractions, go during the week and avoid a weekend visit....unless of course, you enjoy that ""sardine"" effect."
,,Great plants in a dramatic setting.,5.0,,In my opinion this is a must do for visitors to Singapore. The planting is very dramatic and the standard of maintenance is excellent. I found this an exciting and rewarding visit and highly recommend it.
,,Very cool,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome was very cool - a unique concept extremely well executed.

The architecture of the dome is great, the 'forest' is very neat to see and there are spectacular views out of the dome across the river and back to the Marina Bay Sands hotel.

You can wander through leisurely or just power through in half an hour. It was a nice distraction from downtown Singapore and is a very nice renewable/conservation type project."
,,Great,5.0,,"Okay it's man made but it is worth seeing and get there early and not on the weekend, the cords are huge. Worth seeing."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The Cloud dome is very beautiful and obviously a lot of thought has gone into it. If you love flowers and greenary and photography it is a lovely cool place to be out of the heat. I thought it was on the expensive side though.
,,Unique,5.0,,Singapore does like to do thing big and the cloud forest dome is amazing great to do on a rainy day as you are indoor and marvel at this amazing structure and the plants that are in it
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Its a amazing experience to visit this place. And its amazed how they made it. Once you enter you greeted with water fall and you go to till 7th floor. If you are having baby with Pram no issue as they have lifts for prams. From 7th floor you come all the way come down and as its a beautiful place so you even don't realize when you reached down.
,,Unique in my experience,4.0,,"A brilliant reverse example of the usual giant hot houses that countries maintain in order to grow tropicals... This cool mist house allows the temperate plants of home to flourish in this humid singapore heat.
A lovely display well designed and as said unique in my experience.
Not over priced at $28 per adult for both domes ... Although the flower dome is a bit of a disappointment after gawping at the cloud dome.
There is a handy little taxi rank just in the middle by the visitor centre which saved us the long hot walk back to the tourist bus stop my the flying boat!!"
,,Impressive but can get old after a while,5.0,,"Once you enter you will be greeted by a wonderful waterfall that gives you the chills. The inside of the Cloud Forest is air conditioned so the waterfall can make it slightly chilling which is perfect if you are heaty from walking around outside.

The entire dome is wonderfully decorated with different plants and flowers.
The whole concept of the dome is that there are different types of flowers and plants as you go higher and higher. (please read up on some information boards on the sides)

It is up to Level 7 and it can get a bit shaky on the suspension bridges, but kids will love it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This place has impact from the moment you enter and you see the giant waterfall cascading from a mountain of greenery. You take a lift up several stories, then walk down along suspended walkways. There are orchids, reflective pools and lots of forest plants. When they set off the ""mist"" you really feel part of the whole cloud forest experience. Highly recommended."
,,Outstanding way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"Great environment, reasonable price, great way to spend an afternoon with the kids. Don't waste your time on the lighting of the Garden at night... it could be so cool but is a total let down."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,I have never seen a place like this. I was fascinated by the features this place provides. An awesome tourist place and a marvel of architecture. Please Please Please do visit this man made artefact.
,,Breathtaking but a bit dark,4.0,,"Not cheap, but the the sheer scale of this place is amazing with the watferfall dominating everything and you being torn between looking out to the views of the city and looking at the plants inside.

Made the mistake of turning up at 19:30 after dark. It gives a great atmosphere but as the place is only dimly lit, so we felt that we missed out on getting a good look at the amazing array of plants they have squeezed under the dome.

If we ever go back to Singapore this will be on our must see (in the day time) list."
,,Worth the money,5.0,,"I have found in Singapore, when they decide to do something, they certainly do it properly. This is a amazing Dome, the structure is worth a visit alone but the contents will blow you away."
,,The surprise of our trip,5.0,,"How they have managed to create a cool environment within such a large dome is amazing... this was undoubtedly the stand out surprise of our 8 days in Singapore... it takes about an 90 minutes to see it properly but you won't want to rush.

So many different types of flora and so many different things to see. I will go back for sure."
,,Ideal for a rainy morning,4.0,,We found the Cloud Forest Dome a very interesting and informative attraction within Singapore. Very good value for money
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is brilliant. The waterfall is spectacular and you can follow the pathway to the top. Well worth a visit.
,,Wet and wonderful,5.0,,I loved this - the fact that's it cool and air conditioned is no small bonus. The whole space is fascinating - wonderful walkway in the middle of the waterfall. I thought the info points and audio-visual were great - very informative and thought provoking. The difference a 5 degree rise in temp will make to our planet is scary.
,,Cloud Forest Dome is cool,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome is cool for two reasons. It is really a cool place to visit and one in its kind, and otherwise the temperature is also very refreshing after a warm day in Singapore city.

We visited here in the evening and it started to get dark during our visit. Entering the dome faces you with a high waterfall, rising up to the top of the Dome, which is beautifully designed. The path takes you up to the top into the cloud and then you go down slowly along a path that winds around the centre of the Dome. You have breathtaking views on the harbor, Marina Bay Sands and the Bay Garden."
,,I was impressed,4.0,,"It is great to visit with all the different plants from different parts of the world, with a waterfall thrown in. It is also very informative and the presentations thought provoking."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Purchased the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome tickets. The scenery is just so different from any other attractions. As you enter the Cloud Forest it starts you off in front of the waterfalls and you make your way up to the upper levels. The pathway will take you around the dome for some amazing view and lots of photo opportunity. Great to visit during a hot day.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"What a great concept. The massive waterfall upon walking in was breathtaking. The many varieties of plants, simply stunning. We may need some of these in the future.."
,,Good visit,4.0,,"Nice place to cool down. Kids seemed to have fun. Worth a visit in Singapore, a good innovative complex, reflecting a forest mountainside, with wonderful and interesting high walkways with cascading water features."
,,Garden by the bay,5.0,,"The set up was great Viewing platform, views from walkway Man made waterfall Everything was awesome, no negatives about it."
,,Unique vertical gardens,5.0,,"With cylindrical walks. .. oh this is a beautiful place and we'll worth the admission. So brilliantly executed with endless blooming plants and hundreds (thousands? ) of species.
Be sure to go all the easy to the top and then slowly walk down....enjoying every step .... every vista. .... just beautiful.
This is a must do!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Cloud Forest Dome.....great photos....bit chilly, weren't prepared for the cool air! Definitely recommend a visit."
,,Very neat!,5.0,,"I had never been to this before, even though I had been to the marina area twice before. It is really quite a cool exhibit, easily spent two hours walking around, reading, exploring and enjoying this facility."
,,I walk in the sky,4.0,,"This place was in Gardens by the Bay area. I visit this place after look many plants and flowers in the conservatory area. You can see an amazing waterfall when you enter this area, and you can feel the water which fall from the sky. After that you can take an elevator to the upper level.

When you reach the top, you can feel the sensation walking down the bridge from the top-level and down. I have a little high-phobia, because the bridge was see-through bridge, which is you can see what is under your feet!

Then you can see a perfect-city view of Singapore from the top."
,,Just go ! :-),5.0,,"Its a really interesting and cool place to spend time in, cool in the mid day heat and interesting to read some of the exhibits that are dotted along the upper floors. The water fall is just cool to look at and walking down from the top is for the most part quite enjoyable as long as you are not scared of heights."
,,"Amazing, awesome",5.0,,"This should be very short: go and see it for yourself, you won't regret it! Impressive, amazing, awesome! Don't leave Singapore without seeing it unless you are really not into nature, flowers, trees, etc."
,,Great escape from the heat,4.0,,"We visited here after the Flower Dome. The views and photo opportunities were available at every turn. The paths took you up through the different levels and into the cloud area. There isn't a ""correct"" path to follow, so we ended up backtracking to make sure we'd seen everything. There weren't as many explanations as to what the plants were as I was expecting, but the layout was beautiful. I would recommend it to others."
,,Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,Just extraordinary. It makes the greenhouses at Kew Gardens look like my garden at home. One of our top picks in Singapore
,,Different,4.0,,"The cloud forrest dome is definitely something different. Overall very good, some good photo opportunities and just an amazement of the architecture involved. Worth the visit, would probably do about 4 hours overall at this location as a few areas to visit."
,,Great Attraction,4.0,,"I went to Gardens by the Bay specifically to visit the two conservatories. Upon entering you're greeted by the sight of a manmade waterfall and the light and refreshing spray. The entire structure that is built to resemble a mountain is festooned with so many varieties of plants from a myriad of orchids to begonias, rhododendrons and other species. After walking around the base of the structure you then take a lift up to the top and work your way down. The walk informs you of the flora and fauna that inhabit each level from the top to the bottom. There are also educational presentations informing people of the consequences of climate change and the effect it will have on the earth. Definitely a worthwhile experience. If you're afraid of heights - possibly not for you. Watch your footing on the grates as they are slippery with the constant moisture."
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,Do not go to Singapore without going here. It is AMAZING. The size of the exhibit is wonderful. We stayed for the night light show. It was a great day. Worth every cent. The restaurants there catered for all tastes. It is spotless the staff very welcoming and happy answer any questions. I will go back.
,,Refreshing and spectacular for an indoor attraction,5.0,,"Spectacular waterfall that one can walk along the path and/or escalator soaking in the foresty environment. Dew and mist everywhere though all these are manmade. Nice and cooling environment to escape from the tropical heat of Singapore. Many scenic spots for photography. A nice ""natural"" attraction in an air-conditioned dome and is a welcoming change from the brick and mortar attractions elsewhere. A 360 degree view from within the dome overlooking the Marina/city skyline."
,,Once again - amazing...,5.0,,"Breathtaking display... and an indoor waterfall !!!! The skywalk is incredible, the plants are so colourful..."
,,Skip it,3.0,,"If you're from a tropical country, this is not worth visiting. It's all man made. There are much better places you can visit."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,I spent about half an hour in the Cloud Forest Dome. The waterfall was amazing and the view from the top of the mountain was terrific.
,,Amazing forest experience in such a limited space,5.0,,"Singapore really knows how to attract their tourists and entertain their residents along the way. The effort to bring the tropical forest experience into the city is highly appreciated, as we walked inside this dome we'll see enchanted man-made forest with all the bloomed flowers, such a pest and clean environment controlled that made all the experience enjoyable. The dome is cool using AirCon but with sustainable energy.
Bring kids to have them learn about plants, environment and how we can save the earth. Come early in the morning so you could soak up the oxygen better."
,,Great place to cool off while enjoying the garden,5.0,,"The domes are a long-ish walk from the entrance. If you arrived by public transit, and you didn't take the cart ride in, you're probably perspiring on an average day in Singapore by the time you got here. Your choices for cooling off is either the gift shops (there are 3 that I found) or one of the two domes. I enjoyed this one much better than the Flower Dome. You take an elevator to the top and slowly make your way down with escalators between different level. If you only have time for one of the two domes, pick this one. Locals have the choice of only buying tickets for one of the two domes, but I'm not sure if that is available to non-residents.

Unlike the Flower Dome I don't recall seeing any restaurants in there. You exit into one of the gift shop, so you can leave the souvenir shopping to the end.

Best time for visiting this is in the mid afternoon. Visit the domes, have dinner (pack a picnic or eat at one of the many choices around here) then stay for the light show at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the Supertree Grove."
,,Superb Experience,5.0,,"This was amazing, we walked here from the hotel Pan Pacific, definitely worth a visit and would go back again"
,,Fantastic! What can one say!,5.0,,What a fabulous experience. Sensory overload. This is a real credit to those who started the idea and have watched it come to fruition. It's a lovely cool place to be on a hot day. Takes about an hour to two hours to really cover the whole story.
,,Company teambuilding,5.0,,"Our company had a awesome teambuilding session at this place. Although man-made, this place is well designed to bring the waterfall experience into Singapore. Airconditioned & spacious, worth every penny spent on admission. The only complain is the distance from this place to the nearest train station. Otherwise, highly recommended :)"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Really worth visiting Absolutely stunning place, amazing feat of engineering and design Very peaceful with lots of look at It can be a little slippery from the waterfall so be careful and keep those camera lenses dry! Accessible for wheelchairs and prams"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Like the Flower Dome, the vision and desire to create an indoor rainforest has to be seen to be believed. It is impressive both in concept and size. On entering the dome, the first thing that you encounter is the waterfall which sets the scene for your visit. After walking around the lower level, you take the elevator to the top levels for a sample of the plants at higher altitudes in the rainforest. The view from the top of the waterfall is equally stunning. You then make your way back down the walkways to conclude the visit. Hiring the audio guides for $4 is a good investment and it helps to explain many of the features inside the dome. A leisurely walk of about an hour or so should be sufficient. Visiting the Flower and Cloud Domes is an excellent way of escaping the summer heat for a couple of hours.
Thanks for your vote if you found the review helpful."
,,Like nothing you have seen before,5.0,,This has got to be one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life. Definitely the most amazing in an enclosed space. It is refreshing to walk into and there is so much to do.you must try it out
,,WOW,5.0,,"I don't know what I was expecting but it was not what I got, I was amazed by the ecodrome and cannot wait to return again to do the other one!"
,,A must-do in Singapore!,5.0,,Unbelievable construction and amazing plants. Go right to the top and walk down the skywalk to get fantastic views of the man-made waterfall inside and the gardens outside. Have your poncho ready when you enter!
,,There is so much to see in such a small area.,4.0,,"The Dome is within the Gardens by the Bay and next door to Marina Bay complex. There is a diverse range of flowers, shrub and trees to view, smell and touch. Give yourself more time than originally planned of time to stop and smell the roses!"
,,ON CLOUD NINE,5.0,,"You must visit Gardens by the Bay.We got there at 9am and had about an hour before it got too busy.We were able to take lots of photos.
The Cloud Dome is amazing.At one stage you are behind the waterfall .So many beautiful plants and foliage.
It was a wet day and unfortunately the Sky Walk was closed.
We did travel to the top of the largest tree to have a drink and see the extensive views.The walk around the lake was very pleasant.
Had nice coffee and cake near the Gift Shop as well.
I think you should receive a map upon buying a ticket.We had to search for one."
,,Who knew watching plants could be this awesome?,5.0,,"To be honest, I was not too keen on going watching plants but went as I found the building stunning.
So glad I did. The place is mesmerisingly beautiful, the architecture of the place is so unique, the plants are gorgeous...really kudos to whoever designed this place.
My husband was rather reluctant to go and even he was absolutely amazed at the place.
A must if you are in Singapore!"
,,"Cool, Colourful and Green",4.0,,"A lovely hour spent exploring the wonders of the Cloud. A very cool entrance with the waterfall. Great views of the gardens, local area, super trees. Wow, an enjoyable few hours spent here."
,,A must see,5.0,,Do visit this when you go to Gardens by the Bay. The plants in the conservatory are arranged in layers like that seen in actual cloud forests. There is also a short film on environmental conservation and how Gardens by the Bay was designed for it to be sustainable. Make sure to see the Flower Dome roo.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Brilliant - look forward to returning in 5 years when everything has grown even more. Well laid out and organised
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Great way to spend the day. Plenty of beautiful plants to see. Even if gardens aren't your bag this place is still wonderful. The Cloud Forest only makes up part of the Gardens by the Bay experience. Highly recommend taking your time and spending a day here.
,,mountain and waterfall in singapore,5.0,,Liked: cool temperature bridge waterfall plants flowers Lift Disliked: No clue to visitors that its best viewed by going to the top floor first and then coming down.
,,Fantastic Waterfall...,5.0,,"one thing great about this place is the waterfall, its actually not a natural waterfall but its amazed us from the first time we saw it, even my father and mother, they were amazed by this waterfall, because we could easily look at it so close.

besides the waterfall,on the inside there are some facts about earth and all the resources, and how this place not only as an entertaiment but also a place where we could learn, or gain education about earth and its resources, i would say this place is actually very interesting place for young children where they could learn about science and biology during their leisure time."

,,Magnificiant,5.0,,"Every thing inside is amazing and clean. First I feel this is the only Huge Indoor Garden, which include a big water fall and enormous plant life. If you are a plant or nature lover this is a must visit place. It is better to visit in Evening so that you may also enjoy in night out side Garden by the bay. There are also other things inside such as the salt deposits and also information regarding all these things."
,,Indoor Waterfall,4.0,,"Like it's counterpart, the Flower Dome, we appreciated the opportunity to see nature AND enjoy the air con!"
,,A special place,5.0,,This dome is really worth a visit. It is inspiring and a very peaceful place to visit. It is an escape from the bust city atmosphere. The views of the city are also great. Make sure you visit early in the day as I understand that afternoon crowds are not pleasant.

,,"Lovely sight, lots to see, do and learn!",5.0,,"Can't really explain this in a few words to do it justice, I'm sure you've looked at the photos, but not until you go in will you be amazed. Loved the whole place, well worth a visit. You do have to pay extra for this area though. Sign up to Groupon Singapore as that's how I got a voucher, otherwise pay when you arrive (apologies, I'm not sure how much it is)"
,,Worth a look,5.0,,"Completely air conditioned! Informative and interesting. An indoors waterfall, native plants and plenty of information"
,,Great experience - very relaxing and beautiful,4.0,,"The Cloud Dome was worthwhile visiting for a few hours, especially considering the affordability of this destination (~$14 pp). The dome was stunning and the view from the top was breathtaking. Very impressive architecture and plant life."
,,"Wow, the amazon has come to singapore!",5.0,,"Well worth a trip to this amazingly well made and maintained attraction. What I liked:- the waterfall, walking up high amongst the plants and trees. What I didn't like:- nada!"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,This is a truly amazing experience - loved every minute of it. The domes where the last stop on a tour that we did and we decided to stop and have a look around - we where so glad we did. We could have spent all day here - worth every penny.
,,Beautiful Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a must if you're visiting Singapore. Take the subway (which by the way is the cleanest subway I have ever seen) to the Gardens by the Bay and spend a couple of hours here at the Cloud Forest Dome. The Flower Dome is good too, but if you only have time for one, the Cloud Forest is the one to see."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"What can you say about this magnificent dome other than brilliant, another example of why people should visit Singapore."
,,Amazing,4.0,,Great place to visit if you like plants. Very interesting greenhouse kind of thing. Diverse collection of plants. Only thing to complain is the entrance fee is too steep for this kind of place.
,,Super,5.0,,"A must see when visiting Singapore! Climb to the top and work your way down. Take the cloud walk, its cool birds eye view"
,,Somewhat interesting,3.0,,Singapore has lots of plants and that is nice but not exciting unless that is your hobby We liked reservoir area better Go to rooftop for photos
,,"love to stay here...fresh air,fresh mind amazing place!!",5.0,,"i was amaze at the first step with huge giant waterfall it's really amazing they built the watelfall inside the building and love the air, i can fresh my mind, and have some inpirations. i definetly will come here when i come to this country next time..^^"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"nothing to dislike and everything to like,over all a beautiful place to relax and take in the surroundings"
,,Superb biodome,5.0,,"Hazy, murky, mysterious - and in fact downright wet! but well worth a visit, good fun and plenty to learn."
,,Oasis of urban land,4.0,,In highly urbanized Singapore it’s a nice place to spend few hours. The experience would bring you close to nature and the buildings architecture is totally different and the collections of crystals are amazing. I prefer going during sunset which i personally love.
,,A wonder by the Bay,5.0,,"Nothing to dislike about this place. Starting from the bottom, it just gets better as you get higher. Lovely way to spend the morning."
,,Cloud Forest Dome worth a look,5.0,,"This is a great way to get out of the heat and experience what it's like on a mountain top, temperature wise as well as the various plants. There's a couple of man made waterfalls, and lots of interesting plants to look at. Cost is $SIN 28 for tourists for both the Cloud Forest Dome and the Flower Dome - for the two of them that is, not each."
,,walking with Cloud,5.0,,"It’s a lovely place, we feel like walking with Cloud and the overall environment and effect is so nice and min-blowing... during evening we visited this place and it’s really beautiful and we like it. Don’t miss it."
,,"Awesome, magical, wow !!",5.0,,"Loved this, what a wonderful experience. So inspired to see more of Singapore's amazing infrastructure."
,,Wow!,5.0,,This place is amazing. I really wasn't sure what to expect but it is laid out so well and every pathway provides beauty and knowledge. you can go at your own pace but you will find yourself taking longer than you thought you would!
,,Just do it!,5.0,,As a family of 6 with our kids aged 15 - 24 years we went thinking it might be nice.. but WOW it was much more than than! This is just a great experience and well worth a visit. The Singaporeans really know how to create an experience.
,,A must visit when you are in Singapore,5.0,,This is my favourite place in Singapore.It is such an amazing place.I am so in love with the cascading waterfall and the beautiful greenery surrounding this place.The air inside was so cool and refreshing despite the huge crowd.I can sit here all day if I have the time..a great place to relax.
,,Forest in the City,4.0,,"The waterfall welcoming you when you enter the dome. I'm satisfy with my timing coming there, around 5pm until night. I still can enjoy when there is enough sunlight, and when it getting dark, the light is on, which make the place more beautiful. You can enjoy various kind of plant. It has a refreshing cool air also."
,,Escape the constant heat!,5.0,,"Singapore is hot, really hot. The heat can really get to a person, especially when you're from a much cooler temperate climate. Not only is this attracting cool and simply amazing, it's literally cold. This place is a nice way to explore Singapore while also allowing your pours to take a break from producing sweat all day (if you're like me)."
,,Cool morning retreat from outside heat,5.0,,"We travelled to the dome straight after breakfast and arrived as they opened for the day at 10am. As we entered the dome, a massive waterfall is above us and the water spray hangs in the air which is also cooled with some amazing air conditioning technology. There are 6 levels inside the dome which are all commented by suspended metal walkways that circle the central monolith covered in the most beautiful vertical garden we have ever seen. The morning light on all the plants and flowers was spectacular. Well worth a visit and get there early to avoid the crowds"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great variety of orchids and the setting which has been built in the green house is an amazing way to present them. The fake mountain and waterfall creates an amazing micro climate.
,,delightful,5.0,,Great concept. Good to be there.easily accessible. Must atke lots of pictures. ensure you have plenty of battery and storage space. took more than 1000 pics
,,"Some spectacular cloud forest views, and very educational",3.0,,"Just to talk about what I liked :
The place provided different levels of walking paths such as the ground path, the cloud forest walk and the canopy walk, which were quite entertaining and spiritually relaxing for us nature-lovers.
Inside the dome there were also film-playing and multimedia educational panels which taught visitors about global warming and the world, although the effectiveness seems not so great as many visitors just skipped them.

I say that the views are quite good yet I would have preferred a more ""natural"" experience. The environment seemed highly fabricated, lacking a sense of naturality. My visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens was much more fabulous, including my trot down the rainforest trail there.

In terms of sightseeing, this place is somehow worth seeing, but not a must-visit."
,,"Plant, waterfall and so what?",3.0,,"It is beautiful, wonderful and fantastic. It's really impressive that they can grow and take care of millions of plants there but that's it ,nothing more. If you don't want to take ""selfie"" with flowers or plant stuff, just go somewhere else."
,,Unique exhibit of plants,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Cloud Forest Dome at Gardens By The Bay. It is a beautiful and unique exhibit of various plants that thrive in this type of environment. The varieties changed as we ascended the artificial mountain and its representation of the various climatic zones.
,,"Wondeful, exciting, natural, relaxing.",5.0,,"Spectacular waterfall to start with, many orchids of all shapes and colors, amazing man made huge rock and all kinds of plants to watch really close. Sudden mist to make the scenery even more real and natural. Grab your camera. After visiting go to the colorful Gardens by the bay and listen to the music and enjoy the light show at night starting at 7PM plus and 8 PM plus."
,,A garden to educate about the environment,5.0,,"This is a self contained sustainable eco system, replicating the climate of the misty highlands. It has waterfalls and moist beauty and an incredible range of plants. All visitors exit via a passionate detailed account of what is happening to the world's climate and what needs to be done to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is a triumph of sustainable design."
,,They have done a great job here,5.0,,The Singapore people have done a great job on this place. Indoor mountain environment is of interest. Easy access well thought out.go as well to the flower dome.
,,Better than expected,5.0,,"Grandparents, parents & kids all had a great day here. The waterfall is amazing. Recommend taking change of clothes and towel for kids. As they will want to run through the water park zone afterwards."
,,Nice place to relax,5.0,,"Love the garden to chill and relax for Singapore's hot weather. But the foreigner only can purchase the two dome tickets together, only local people can purchase one separately."
,,Very nice but.....,2.0,,"The walk to the dome was very tiring. There were no benches or places where one could rest as the the walks were very long in the burning sun.
Shame on you Singapore. Not everybody, especially the older people can walk like youngsters, I saw old folks struggling to get to the dome and some people were sitting on the grass in the sun."
,,Educational is good!,4.0,,"The trip was to showcase this latest attraction. For people whom had seen nature reserve, this may not be exciting. However for educational visit, this is good. However, if the staff can talk to the guest, it will be better."
,,Heavenly,5.0,,If you're a lover of flora and fauna then you definitely want to spend some time here. Not only is it an air conditioned haven for escaping the heat..it is an exceptionally well maintained and beautifully arranged garden of heavenly delights. I will be going there every time I'm in Singapore. Loved it!
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"An amazing place with incredible construction. Watch out in the gift shop though, damage something and it is 'considered sold'"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Loved the different plants, going around the different levels. It is refreshing in the conservatory after the humidity outside. Amazing orchids and other flowers."
,,"Amazing, beautiful place",5.0,,"It's amazing how they can grow all these plants from different continents in one dome. The place is beautiful, and you can smell the fragrance of flowers as soon as you step in. Just a magnificent place."
,,no cloud,4.0,,You are greeted by a blast of cold and wet air. Be careful walking around as the floor does get slippery in some places as it is consistently wet. This shows you what plants grow in various altitudes.
,,Visit the Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,"Amazing structure with breath taking waterfall that is several stories tall. It was amazing to view and walk through on the different levels. It is a ""must visit"" especially during the summer since the temperature is cooler inside. A memorable experience and very affordable."
,,Magnificently made!,4.0,,A great place to cool of during a hot day in Singapore. The 'mountain' is a lot of fun to walk around as there are many types of plants to be seen.
,,A Great place must visit,5.0,,A great place to visit and enjoy a Man made true forest.The walk in the clouds was very good and a great experience. The water fall just keeps you mesmerized.
,,Majestic,5.0,,They have created an entire cloud forest inside this dome. Beautiful and Very informative at the same time. At the end they run a video which shows what will happen if earth's temperature rises above 5Deg. I wish they understand that its not going to help them until they stop eating meat.
,,Beautiful and Unique,4.0,,This was a fun way to spend the morning. The Cloud Dome allows you to walk through a beautiful structure - nature meets excellent infrastructure. I would highly suggest this on a visit to Singapore. It was beautiful.
,,Perfect place to cool off,4.0,,"Singapore can get a bit hot, so if you need an amazing place to cool off and relax try the cloud garden at Gardens by the Bay. You can get there from the helix bridge cross over (take some great photos of the bay) , then go underground via the mall (see if you can find the shop that sells alligator golf bags) to the gardens. You can walk around outside then grab a ticket from the kiosk in the shaded area between the glasshouses. There are places it sit outside and some excellent carving.
Then inside of a splash and an amazing view of orchids, carnivorous plants, crystals and stalagmites and stalactites from what would have been a spectacular cave. This experience is not to be missed (excuse the pun, water and mist billow everywhere). The lift goes up several floors and you can see different things on each floor. There is a minute town, and many traditional carvings."
,,Fascinating place to visit,4.0,,"Cool climate plants in a pleasing cool climate venue. Beautifully laid out - fascinating plants, and with a depressing but clear presentation at the end about climate change."
,,"If you go to Gardens by the Bay, don't miss this...",4.0,,"I went to Gardens by the Bay because when I was here previously, I just saw these bizarre giant mushroom/tree things being built and thought, ""I have to see what that's going to be on my next visit!"" Well, I went to the Gardens, which I'll review later, but paid for the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome.

The Cloud Forest was worth the price and it's basically focused around an environmental phenomena known as a, well, Cloud Forest. I had never heard of such a thing, but I learned a lot about them through this amazing exhibit.

You enter the Forest and are immediately confronted with a giant ""mountain"" with a beautiful, lighted man-made waterfall. There are plants all around, but you can see that you'll eventually being going up pathways through the mountain and behind and, eventually, on top of the waterfall.

This was a great experience with several learning centers along the way with mist, plants, and flowers all over. You swirl up through the mountain and pass under the waterfall and then eventually on top of it and can see down below where you were at.

I will say that I went very late and as it got darker, it definitely got harder to see. I would like to go during the day and I can only imagine, with it being a giant glass building, that it's much brighter.

Anyway, I would definitely recommend it, but I have a feeling if I went during the day, this review probably would have been a 5 instead of a 4."
,,Unique idea,5.0,,loved the foggy effect made inside to give the rainforest theme. pencil heels are better to avoided if you are going for a walk in cloud forest
,,excellent visit,5.0,,"We had been expecting it would be hot and steamy inside as it was very hot and sunny outside. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find it was quite cool. Very impressive dome and loved the quirky plant features and waterfall."
,,Just awesome,5.0,,"This is almost a not-negotiable place to visit in Singapore. It's just breathtaking - one of those 'Wow' experiences when you walk in. It's best experienced late in the afternoon (allow a couple of hours before sunset), so that the Supertrees can be seen at night."
,,Cloud forest in Gardens by the bay,5.0,,It is so awesome! one of a kind experience to walk on a very high platform while looking at the garden around and underneath you.
,,Amazing,5.0,,I still can get over how amazing this place is. The incredible way they have create an Ecosystem is just overwhelming.
,,Amazing concept,5.0,,Went there on a rainy sunday and loved the experience. Its amazing how they built the whole structure and the flowers inside are beautifull Definitely something to go visit at least once
,,Heights to Behold,5.0,,"Walk through a waterfall and you're on your way to discover a world of plants and heights. Take the lift to level 6 and walk down through the dome and its walkways, absolutely breathtaking and even a little bit scary ( if you don't like heights) but well worth it."
,,Must see,4.0,,"We chose the hottest most humid day to visit the Botanic Gardens and when I saw the domes I imagined it was going to get even hotter inside these glass structures. However, when we walked it a cool breeze hit us. Yay for airconditioned domes!

It was amazing to see such a structure, a huge waterfall, amazing orchids and plant life, a treetop walk, different levels to explore.

A must see while in Singapore. It cost approx. $23 each but worth it."
,,For those who love green,3.0,,"If you like green and interesting with the plant, this will be the best place. The place is cooling I like the design of the waterfall and the pond at the highest level, that is the 2 main attraction for me in this dome. The rest may be bored or not much special. It is just that if once is not familiar with the plant, it somehow looks like the plant that you will see normally even outside the dome."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Inside this enormous dome is a 35 metre man made mountain and waterfall depicting a cool moist tropical mountain region. It was covered in orchids, ferns, impatiens and various other plants. We took a lift to the 6th floor and then followed a spiral walk-way down enroute looking at the various plants and flowers which gave a collage of colour.

As a rule we prefer to see plants and flowers in their natural environment and we did in fact go to the Singapore Botanical gardens but we felt the Cloud Forest was very good and certainly well worth a visit."
,,"Awe-inspiring views, a nice respite from the heat outside",5.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest Dome and the Flower Dome on the same day a few weeks ago. Naturally these are both places to go to escape the heat and humidity of Singapore. However, each has unique offerings that make them worthwhile visits regardless of the temperature outside. You enter the Cloud Forest at the bottom of a rather imposing-looking wall of plants and a cascading waterfall. The wall continues all the way up to the ceiling, and you scale it via walkways (or interior elevators) that take you around through various rainforest-type plants and of course excellent exterior views through the glass dome where you can see Marina Bay Sands with almost unimpeded clarity. Kids enjoyed this dome more than the Flower Dome but each is worth a visit. We didn't need coats but some people did bring light jackets from what we saw...you could get a little wet if you get close to the waterfall(s) and of course some people are less-tolerant of air conditioning than others."
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore, do not forget to visit Garden By the Bay and especially Cloud Forest Dome. The entire experience inside the Dome is unique."
,,Artistic,4.0,,"I wonder how much vision would have gone on to make a forest built of Concrete and steel and yet completely mesmerizes as if you are walking in a forest .. Nice concept , Must visit in Singapore."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,I really enjoyed the sky walk and the water fall. very photogenic place . A must go place.though bit tiring but would suggest to have red bull and take a look around . It definitely worth a visit or many .
,,Great diverse gardens,5.0,,"Lovely to see a wide range of trees and shrubs in a lovely setting, well thought out and informative too."
,,MAGICAL,5.0,,A wonderful attraction in an amazing place. A glorious walk amongst some wonderful plants and flowers to the sound of the water fall - a stunning indoor garden and most certainly worth making the effort to see. Highly recommend.
,,A cool oasis,5.0,,"My favourite part of Gardens by the Bay and not just because it was refreshingly cool, in contrast to the extreme heat outside. The plants and the waterfalls were spectacular, and the ""clouds"" at the top of the mountain added to the effect. Tip: Begin by walking around the entrance level, then take the lift to the top level. From there you can work your way back down via ramps and escalators. Going the opposite way is just plain awkward."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"12 stories of dome enclosing an 11 story waterfall and rain-forest, thousands of exotic plants cover the artificial mountain structure complete with sky walks and orchids. One of the most stunning indoor gardens I have ever visited and totally worth a visit."
,,Well worthwhile,4.0,,"Really interesting stroll thru a controlled ""cloud forest"" environment. Quite relaxing during a stop-over in Singapore."
,,Really Feels Like One,5.0,,"This place is awesome, the entrance itself is so magical with the waterfall. We were mesmerized with this place. The overall experience in the middle of the city was great."
,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,"It was such a bliss spending some time at this place. The moment you enter the dome, you will be welcomed by beautiful cool air which is misty and fresh. You will be able to see a manmade tower which is covered by trees and moss and it is absolutely wonderful. You are able to climb the tower and do a cloud walk which is highly recommended although if you are scared of heights, you may have a little problem completing it so you might like to do it with someone else! The whole place just gives you this amazing nature feel and it really is refreshing to be there from the heat outside.

As a traveller, you require to purchase both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest tickets but you won't be dissapointed if you would like a nature experience as both places are fantastic. You can easily spend a couple of hours at each places enjoying the atmosphere. If you are staying in Singapore just for a few days, this is one place you definately don't want to miss."
,,Wow,5.0,,Absolutely amazing to walk around all these levels in a tropical jungle I was really impressed. It was quite expensive.
,,amazing experience for the whole family,5.0,,"bring your family (especially with the 6-yr above kids).. and see how their face look when experiencing this place... do not come here if you or your family member afraid of height and you can not control them... one of my kid afraid of height, but we take photos together on the top... it likes you are walking on top of world height, safely and cool air... also you can learn about some flora as well"
,,Bonus inclusion in our holiday,4.0,,"Our flight home was delayed by 3.5hrs and as the hotel was unable to accommodate us for longer in-house, we wandered across to the cloud forest and weren't disappointed. An absolutely stunning array of plants and a welcome relief from the heat outdoors. Easily spent an hour traversing the different levels and particularly enjoyed the waterfalls and little information cards/signs along the way. Well worth going to if time allows."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"This place is amazing - don't miss it! Good value for money and very interesting, great place to get out of the heat too."
,,WOW,5.0,,"Unbelievable, great walk up to the top and the waterfall was astounding. All of it has no air con but is cooled by an inventive way."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Got a discounted ticket for both the Bio-domes. Cloud forest was way better. Nice ans cool... Escape the heat. Reasonably priced lockers 1sSgd$.
,,Good experience,5.0,,I like the coolness inside of the doom for it was warm outside first of all. The beautiful arrangements of plants and flowers was pleasing to our eyes. When we were there several groups of kids were alternatively performing as well which added to the attractions.
,,One time walk !,1.0,,"Will prefer botanical gardens anyday. However, a good concept which is well executed. Went there with family 6 months back."
,,Interesting,5.0,,Great way to fill in an afternoon well worth the visit. Make sure you leave enough time to look around the Gardens by the Bay and stay for the nightly light show
,,Indoors. Air conditioned.,5.0,,"Who knew we'd stumble upon and indoor, air conditioned forest park in Singapore! Fortunately for us, we were wandering around inside during a heavy rainstorm so we stayed dry."
,,A must see,5.0,,"This is an amazing place. It's truly impossible to fully describe. It's beautiful, perfect for young and old and you are educated about nature while you are there!!"
,,great place,5.0,,"After watching it being built over the last few years, a trip to the cloud / flower domes was number one on my list after doing the other attractions on previous trips to Singapore, it did not disappoint me! A terrific days outing with a cool break from the heat as a bonus, the plant life is superb and from all over the world, there is plenty to do nearby with Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands right next door"
,,Great Idea of an Indoor Garden,5.0,,Great place to chill. It gives you a feeling as if you are roaming mountain side with waterfalls and thick foliage all around. Couds are simulated with the help of water vapours and they look so real. Its a huge dome covered with glass panels and have climate control. Must visit.
,,"If you can only do one dome, do this one!",5.0,,"A refreshingly cool and stunningly attractive place to go on a hot day. Wonderful waterfall, great use of the dome height with its several layers, fun walkways seemingly over nothing, gorgeous flowers, and luxuriant growth. Something to delight everyone. At the end is an audiovisual about earth warming which is all the more potent after appreciating the beauty that surrounds us. A rather underwhelming section of stalagmites and stalactites, but plenty else to enjoy. Go to the top as soon as you can and then walk down... If it's possible to only pay for one dome, do this one."
,,Cool,4.0,,We loved Singapore and Cloud Forest Dome is a must see site. It is a Tropical rain forest so it can little COOL inside the dome. There is a lot of moisture so if you chill easily be sure to bring your sweater. Since the domes are enclosed it is a good place to visit on one of Singapore's many rainy days. Make sure you have your camera. If you are not a Singapore resident It is a little overpriced.
,,Night time view,4.0,,Magical! you can take stunning pictures at night. We really enjoyed this experience even though we had little time. It closes at 9pm and we got there at 810pm. But managed to make our way to the top for the stunning views and to stop and admire the beautiful flowers and take pictures in front of the waterfalls.
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,Don't leave Singapore without visiting this area. It's unique and architecturally pleasing. Now this is what I call a green house.
,,"Pleasantly cool on a hot day, unadvertised reduction in price for just the one dome",4.0,,"A pleasant walk around a spiralled forest of orchids and a giant waterfall in a nice cool dome. Perfect for a hot day or rainyy weather. If you only want to do this dome and not both of the domes at the Gardens by the Bay, just tell the ticket desk. Locals get in cheaper than us tourists and have a wider range of advertised fees, but we paid the unadvertised cheaper fee of I believe around $18 for the one dome per person."
,,Its ok,4.0,,Its a good attraction but I personally won't like to spend so many dollars for these attraction. Still the water fall was good.
,,definitely worth a visit amazing experience also a nice respite from the heat very well laid out..,4.0,,"Liked all I saw at Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest Dome, an amazing piece of work, well worht a visit."
,,A must do!,5.0,,Had a brilliant day out here! A must do for all tourists. The flowers are amazing and the waterfall provides the perfect addition to a very pleasant atmosphere.
,,superb,5.0,,"really amazing, we opted for a night tour and this was included in that, it was a great experience. easily one can spend whole day inside."
,,Exceeded expectations,5.0,,"This is my third visit to the city and my first to these gardens. And it should have been my third. The thought and effort that have gone into creating a fully self sustainable environment is outstanding.
You will find this a trip for not only adults but interactive and interesting for the kids.
With the internal 65 meter water fall and educational stations as you wonder through the enclosure.
Defiantly worth the visits and not to be missed.
When you get a ticket it's best to get a joint ticket to the cloud Forrest and the flower dome.
You can also get pass outs at a the exit so if you plan on coming back for the super tree light show which is on at 7.45 and 8.45 you can re enter. However the enclosures close at 8 pm sharp."
,,Special!,5.0,,Day and night look & feel very different there. Another world out there. Cool place to relax. Bring a jacket just in case
,,Remarkable,5.0,,A very clever bit of design and construction and planting. Quite a different experience and one well worth doing. Be prepared for slopes and stairs
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay which I have already reviewed, this part of a visit should definitely be included in your visit"
,,temperate rainforest,5.0,,Beautifully arranged high altitude and high rain tropical environment for glorious plants and a pleasant break from the heat of the Marina Bay Gardens :).
,,A rare treat,4.0,,"Unusual to find a greenhouse that is cooler than the outside, but that is the case here. The dome contains an artificial mountain and waterfall that mimics the climate of the cloud forests, and does it very well. Great abundance of flowers and plants, and a great skywalk around the mountain!"
,,A serine beautifully designed exhibit at the Gardens by the Bay!,4.0,,"From bring greeted by a waterfall at the entrance to going up the dome to see the different floral exhibits along with all the information and the Marina Bay Sands in the backdrop, it's certainly worth a visit. This entire area is a relatively new attraction in Singapore. Was there with my family and the children had a lot to learn and see."
,,Very Pretty,4.0,,This was a very pretty experience. So many different kinds of flowers and plants. And the waterfall was stunning. The walk is interesting and imaginative. I would recommend this to anyone.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We loved the cloud forest, something you dont see everywhere, worth the visit! We loved the waterfall, and all the different plants"
,,A memorable experience,5.0,,"Within the space of a few minutes, one is moved to a cloud forest in a highly creatively designed environment. The huge number of species, waterfalls, imaginatively created walkways and environmental education imparted in a variety of ways make this conservatory a necessary place on one's itinerary in Singapore."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"Gardens by the bay has 2 conservatories - Flower dome & Cloud forest. One should'nt miss these places. The other major attraction are the ""SuperTrees"", there is also a childrens park (water & sand ) near by the conservatories.

It could take you 4hr to a day to visit the complete place. It depends from person to person. There are lighting show / events near the ""Supertree grooves"" at 7:45pm & 8:45pm, these r free shows. One could plan it accordingly.

The rest of the gardens are collection of plants/trees from all over the world and themed accordingly."
,,Like A Real Forest,5.0,,Loved everything about this dome. You even got a spray from the indoor waterfall on entry and the climate changed the higher you climbed. There were no negatives
,,Beautiful & awesome!,5.0,,"This man-made sustainable ""forest"" is living proof that mankind has a choice and the capability to either take care of or destroy Mother Nature.

We come from a neighboring country and this is our family's first visit to Cloud Forest. We are so thankful and glad that we spent a day walking around the two domes in Gardens by the Bay.

Beautiful, really!"
,,amazing!,4.0,,"I can spend half a day walking around this place. I'm in awe of the great collection of flora in this place. The whole design of the place is amazing. It's a good place to learn & explore. The place is temp controlled, cool for both the plants & for guest to enjoy the facility. Great place to take photos of the flowers & of people against the luscious garden. There are benches in some areas for resting and if I wasn't so excited to explore the whole place, it would have been great to just sit on a bench, draw, read or just talk & hang out. Be sure to go up & enjoy the Cloud Walk. Great views of the Singapore Flyer, the river & the surrounding outdoor from up there. Also a good place for photo ops if your not afraid of heights. There's also a small area at the very end of the tour that showcases crystals. I loved it!"
,,Simply beautiful!,5.0,,"Great sensory experience in a stunning architectural landmark. Also, the perfect place to be for a climate controlled break from the heat and humidity!"
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,I came from a country with lots of forest and easy access to nature but this place is really really amazing. I tend to gain more appreciation of the beauty of flowers and plants in this amazing man made dome - quite surprising.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"This is one of the coolest gardens I have visited. Huge waterfall as you walk in and you can feel the change in atmosphere.

The lift takes you up to the top and then you begin your descend through the gardens. It is like a big mountain of greenery and you walk among it. It is one of the best things I have done in Singapore. I would definitely go back during my next visit to Singapore."
,,Gets better and better as you progress through it,5.0,,"At first I was worried that due to the Singapore heat, the plants looked a bit worn out, with brownish or yellowing leaves and dry. But not to worry - there is plenty of lushness around the corner, and the experience is unique, with an admirable design concept. We were lucky to arrive here early in the day, a little before hoards of schoolchildren. And to be inside during a downpour. (It was actually chilly inside as there was no direct sun.) The contiguous Flower Dome is also worth your time."
,,Sweet relief from the Singapore heat,4.0,,"Absolutely loved the cloud dome - was sold as soon as we walked in both by the beauty of the rainforest and waterfall as well as the cool, cool air that was very welcome in the humid Singapore weather."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Interesting and good safe sky walk. Was good value for money. Also enjoyed the rest of the gardens by the bay.
,,A must for all who come to Singapore,5.0,,This is a unique place and a welcome break from the humid outdoor climate of Singapore. It really is stunning for both its planting and structure. Bring a light top to keep you warm indoors!
,,beautiful,5.0,,"felt like being in the middle of nowhere, cool and impressive, easy to walk around, great displays, not expensive,"
,,Magnificent,4.0,,"Still developing as plants take time to grow, but truly magnificent none the less. The atmosphere and way you are led round the dome without really realising it is very clever. The only one thing I didn't really like although it was interesting was the area with stalag titles and stalagmites where actual samples had been taken from there natural setting and moved to the dome, but a really fabulous experience dispute this minor imperfection."
,,Must see place,4.0,,Very interesting place and new concept. Attractive indoor park with lot to see.Outdoor park trees which is free of charge looks wonderful in the evening with lights on.
,,Rainforest and lots more,5.0,,Wow! It's hard to describe the rainforest plants and the setting in this dome. Kids and adults will love it. So much to see and do in here.. Go and see for yourself. A must do in singapore
,,Worth viewing,5.0,,It's a man made garden fully air conditioned and a kind of vertical garden with variety of flowers and plant and of course a water falls which gives a cool shower and a very fresh feel natural look Must must must see this
,,Beautiful and tranquil,5.0,,Very well made with a lot of thought gone into it. Great to escape the extreme heat of the afternoon. Beautiful place to relax in.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was such a surprising find! It was such a pleasant relief from the heat and really refreshed us to attack the Marina Bay Sands complex. Walking up so high on pathways through the mist was quite exhilarating. A must see in Singapore.
,,"Beautiful and well created, nice temperature",5.0,,"Fabulously built the dome was cove in a variety of beautiful orchids. The temperature was much cooler than I expected and don't forget to look at the views outside of the dome as you stand at the top levels!
Any flower or photographer enthusiasts will love this one! I spent almost 2 hours in here just slowly taking all the plants and flowers in. I saw there was an audio tour available that may have answered my questions about some of the plants. Many were labeled but even more were not so image many photos of unknown flowers.
You won't be disappointed."
,,ALOW PLENTY OF TIME,5.0,,This attraction was fantastic. The building itself is remarkable. But the waterfall and the plants are truly amazing. Allow at least 2 to 3 hours for this.
,,Spacious and beautiful!,5.0,,I enjoyed the visit to the dome and it housed some really alien looking plant species that were displayed quite nicely.
,,Amazing waterfalls,5.0,,We loved the Cloud Forest dome as you took a lift to the top and walked down through the different levels of vegetation. Well worth the money.
,,A Must See in Singapore,5.0,,"This conservatory is definitely a must see while in Singapore.

My husband and I were looking for a place to escape the blazing humidity and heat and the Cloud Forest was a great place to do that. We literally spent a few hours here just wandering through conservatory observing all the beautiful plants and admiring the architecture. Take a lift to the ""Lost World"" and walk through suspended sky walks that take you through the lush vegetation and see spectacular views of the world's tallest indoor waterfall! It's amazing and for some reason reminded me of Jurassic Park. So lush and beautiful. The sky walks are definitely not for those who are afraid of heights as you can even see through the walk ways to the bottom floor. Definitely a great place for photo ops though. We even saw a couple taking engagement photos!

Cloud Forest will give you a very educational experience. You'll learn a ton about cloud forests and the importance of conservation. A rude awakening to the needs of protecting the environment and the future of mother earth. Open from 9AM-9PM daily except for maintenance days so be sure to check the website because my husband and I wanted to go on a Monday and I think they were closed on that day. We paid $20 I believe per person but Singapore residents get a discounted rate.

Definitely a must see!!"
,,A real eye opener and a relief from the heat.,5.0,,You could easily spend many hours in here and not just because it's cool. There are just so many aspects of this slice of life under a dome. If you prefer to keep blinkers on then best avoid the theatre presentation on the way out. Then again you should watch it and we might possibly avoid the environmental disaster it depicts.
,,Singapore's Eden Project,2.0,,"If you like a waterfall surrounded by greenery and flowers, then this place is for you. They have suspended sky walks at different floors, but it's not for those afraid of heights. If you like Eden Project in the UK, then you might like this."
,,This place is amazing -it is a must do and make sure you have plenty of time.,5.0,,The amount of plants and the architecture of the dome is breath taking.makes you wonder with the age of some plants how some weren't lost during planting.
,,Must see when you are in Singapore,5.0,,A beautiful place to see and explore. Made my husband and I appreciate and value of the earth we have been blessed. Very informative. I hope this will be replicated in different countries. Hats off to the people who made this possible.
,,Loved loved,5.0,,We loved going to the forest the boys loved it too. Took lots of great photos it took us about 2 hours... Will be coming back
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Fantastic experience. In our view this was the better of the two domes on offer. Both were great. If you have limited time and money this is the preferred one.
,,Gardens from above high,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome offers a unique experience with its indoor waterfall and suspended walkways leading you around the different levels and displays. Well worth a visit, especially to escape the heat outside!"
,,Just the best!,5.0,,"Had been looking forward to seeing Gardens by the Bay for ages and just adored both the domes, but this one with its giant waterfall and wonderful selection of plants was my favourite. An absolute must see even for non gardeners like my husband!"
,,A great way to escape the heat,4.0,,"The first feeling inside the dome: cool (the temperature) and fresh (the air). This artificial rain forest gives one a flavor of a lush, green forest with a variety of plants without the mosquitoes. The entrance fee is quite costly but if you have an SQ boarding pass, you'll get 10% off."
,,Absolute breathtaking!!,5.0,,I love the entire Garden at the Bay. This cloud dome definitely the best part of all. Enjoy so much of walking in the cloud. Just a bit too cold inside. Remember to bring jacket or scarf
,,An iconic building,5.0,,"Fascinating to see all the orchids and exotic plants in a natural environment. Also nice and cool inside, a welcome break from the humidity"
,,cloud forest,4.0,,Beautiful and informative but rather dead! I expected to see and hear birds and monkeys in the trees as one would normally see in an amazonian forest.
,,Eye pops up and jaw dropping experience,4.0,,"this is one of the best experience in my life , i will love to see many times. grt information and collection ....super se bhi uper. worth spending time and money on this."
,,Shorft interlude,5.0,,The architectural treatment of the whole Gardens by Bay are awe inspiring - a cooling refuge from the humid and crowds of the city - comprehensive gift shop - food outlets could be a little more varied and less expensive
,,Cloud Forest without Cloud,4.0,,"This facility has superb architecture and theoritically very good for environment if can be adapted to daily lives. I doubt that the facility even can be managed by it's own without outside support for electricity and water supply. The people behind this project are doing great work, even if this is my 2nd visit, I still amazed by it and enjoy it very much."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Although I hate heights it was so worth visiting this unbelievable place. So cool and lush and the waterfall is amazing. Do not miss this!
,,Water Fall view with Awesome feeling,4.0,,You see a all together different world inside the cloud forest. You enter in front of water fall and go up to see the hidden treasure. You feel awesome as you see so many things and plants around you. many flowers and other things. Special plants with killing apps.
,,"""Artificial""",3.0,,"To be truthful, it is artificial, and does look the part too... I would say that the man-made water fall and the forest did created a sense of awe on my 4 year old son, but failed to impress me. My be because i have seen naturally created forests.

But at any rate, the entrance fee is not justifiable."
,,Man-made but wonderful insight into rain forests,5.0,,The facility is very obviously man-made but provides an interesting and different insight into rain forests. I would highly recommend visiting when you are in Singapore.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Not so good for those with vertigo but a great walk round, particularly on a very hot day. The fountain inside keeps everything cool and wonderful exotic flowers"
,,you must visit !!!,5.0,,"we went into the dome because it was raining....thank goodness it did rain as we would not have visited this attraction, it is a must if visiting Singapore!!!!"
,,"spectacular combination of botany, engineering & art not a place to miss if u're in singapore",5.0,,"At first, I thought it wouldn't be better than the Dubai Miracle garden but I was wrong .The beauty of a tropical rain forest is neatly encapsulated within a temperature-controlled glass dome. Located within the Marina Bay Sands area , there are many attractions within The Gardens, due to the hot season we avoid open areas but visited both of the domes .Fall is really cold and, Cloud Forest is chilled and amazing, One of the coolest place to have a walk in a perfect fine garden, sceenery and environment. The detail maintenance is near perfection, the signs are very neat and clear.a picture perfect place.We got a chance to see all kinds of flora from around the world in the two forest domes here. The super trees are also a treat by themselves too and a walk on the elevated walkways is good too!"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,This place was amazing. A true credit to the designers and engineers who built this landmark. Singpore sets a bench mark for the rest of the world to take note of. Their beautiful gardens are a pleasure to spend time in. Thank you
,,Exceptional,5.0,,"Wonderful creation of a rain forest in a dome, a nice meandering walkway that takes you through various different plant species. A lovely waterfall and even the mist when you get up to the top. A very nice experience and highly recommended."
,,"Very, very interesting!!",4.0,,"This is an educational and novelty treat if you are interested in science, botany and geology - and in the typical ASEAN environment. It is also a simply amazing building - and well done. It isn't a real nature getaway as there many reminders that this is man-made after all. But it is worth a visit and quite enchanting actually."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Well worth paying the entry fee. A Lovely experience. So easy to walk around. The canopy walkway accessed by lift up and walk down.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Brilliant and well worth a visit. There is a fee to enter these domes but it is well worth the cost and there is a fee to go to the top of the Supa tree but also this worth it to see an amazing view
,,Surpised!,5.0,,We were in for a surprise – great concept. So close to nature and loved the walk in the clouds. The evening light show was also very spectacular.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"We were walking along the bay when we came across the Cloud Forrest Dome, which initially didn't seem that interesting. However once inside I soon had a change of heart, a great way to pass an hour or so walking up the track and enjoying the view."
,,Amazing sight to see,5.0,,Really enjoyed our trip to the Dome. The sights when you are inside the dome walking the walkways are incredible. Plus the gardens outside are worth a visit. Inside it can be a little chilly so remember to take a thin jersey.
,,very good experience,4.0,,"At first, it seems like a cold hell as it is super cold, yet the way horticulturist in garden by the bay has done an extraordinary job placing and maintaining the clouded forest to exhibit the plants the best way they can. the cold weather is bad at first but i guarantee you will get use to it. we have to understand that they make it cold to let the plants growing there happy. the pictures you can take there is very diverse, lots of good views. kids might be bored very soon, but the view will let even the worst plants hater love it and filled with amazement and awe. but people will get bored soon as the exhibit is not too diverse.
the conservation efforts they try to tell about the forest is not strong enough and i do not understand if they want to conserve, why use so much electricity to power and cool the dome. especially the water fountain certainly take lots of power to make the huge amount of water flow down.
in the area, you will be amazed when you first see the water fountain, then the plants they grow. some you might have not seen. the plants is so exotic,rare and sensitive. then you go to the tallest peak of the fountain and the view is even better. unique architecture and plants grown is amazing. take a picture there, wonderful.
the next thing you do is go down to the ground floor by using the sky walk they create, again, amazing.
it can be a little scary for kids so for those who are scared of heights, sky walk is NOT advisable.
then you go underground and see more unique plants.
the price is too high for gardens but for those who love plants certainly should go there."
,,Impressive waterfall,4.0,,"We visited the dome as part of our excursion to Gardens by the Bay. The dome is very impressive - the waterfall especially is the central focal point of this attraction. A warning to those with vertigo the walkway can be somewhat intimidating. I certainly found it to be so. All in all, a great way to spend a morning out of the hot Singapore sun!"
,,"No more words, simply amazing",4.0,,It resembles a huge cloud forest with many stories. I loved the orchids and the waterfall here. It was quite scary to look down from the top but really worth trying.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Allow about 1 hour to enjoy the waterfall and surrounding rainforest. The temperature was cooler than outside which made it pleasant if you are not so used to Singapore heat. Great views from the top and beautiful flowers along the way. Glad we went.
,,Nice change during summer,5.0,,Very cold but inviting the sounds of the waterfall is very relaxing. It was great walking through it in the middle of summer.
,,Very cool,4.0,,The waterfall is a great introduction to this dome and is very refreshing. The only odd thing is that you have to take the lift to the very top of the 'mountain' to start walking down. I get vertigo so wanted to get the left to the first walkway and just walk down from there - I wasn't able to do that.
,,a step into another world!,4.0,,a beautiful and amazing glimpse into the rainforest world. Also gave me insight into a post-nuclear fall out survival world ;) Worth a visit!
,,Manmade... yet so natural,4.0,,"Cloud Forest Dome amazes you with its infrastructural brilliance. The waterfall, the cool-climey feel, the upward ascending set-up is actually very nice. Plus, it is very informative as well. Do not miss to read about Super Trees and the working of Cloud Forest."
,,Go after sunset,4.0,,"A magical experience altogether,but the exhibits were boring except for the Lost World.Hope they had proper info boards for all the plants."
,,A mountain in bloom....,5.0,,"If you're traveling to Singapore, would highly recommend a visit to the Gardens by the Bay and, in particular, the Cloud Forest Dome. It's a man-made"" mountain of lush greens, flowers and waterfalls. You can take an elevator to the top, then walk down on meandering walkways that take you inside, outside, and around the structure. One of the most stunningly beautiful things I've ever seen! p.s. If you're afraid of stationary heights, would recommend staying in the center of the walkways. The sides of the walkway are sturdy metal mesh. You're several stories above the base of the structure, but the views are spectacular!"
,,Does not live up to the title,3.0,,"For those who know what a cloud forest is really like, this is something of a letdown - and not a cheap one either. It's basically the same gag as the Supertrees outside the dome, i.e. a large central structure (in this case, a ""mountain"") with mounted epiphytic plants such as bromeliads, orchids, some ferns, and so on.

It still gets ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" from those from temperate climes, and I guess to their eyes it might look fairly exotic. To anyone born and bred in the tropics however, the selection of plants is disappointingly narrow, and very familiar. There is little rhyme or reason in the way they are laid out, either. They could have pushed the selection and presentation of plants much, much further, e.g. with an area for giant ferns, or perhaps organised it more around various bioclimes to show the diversity of cloud forests and how other species exist in harmony with the plants.

(To see what you're missing, just Google ""cloud forest plants""!)

Plus points: Some interesting AV shows for kids, and it's nice and cool inside after the heat of the day outside.

Conclusion: A spectacular structure (I took more photos of the dome than of the plants!) but curated with little flair or imagination. This could be so, so much better as an exhibit and I hope it will become that. The same comments apply to the Flower Dome (separate entrance fee): great building, shame about the content.

The Gardens By The Bay are definitely worth a visit, but personally I thought the other parts of the park (like the Supertrees) were better than the two enclosed conservatories.

Sometimes, the best things in life really are free!"
,,A unique escape,5.0,,The cloud Forrest dome is so impressive with the extent of plants that are on display and the waterfall is refreshing. It's a nice cool escape from the humidity especially if u have a wonder around the outside free gardens first. We were there around late morning midweek so it was not packed and we were able to take our time exploring all the levels while our daughter napped in the stroller. If you only have time to visit one dome definitely choose this one over the flower Dome.
,,stunning flora!,5.0,,"Wow! I have never seen this many flowers that well maintained and so beautiful! I must've taken a hundred pictures! the cloud forest is much better than the other dome there (forgot its name) which, although beautiful, was a disappointment by comparison!"
,,Imax is interesting,5.0,,"Cool way to spend a hot afternoon, since the Cloud Forest Dome is covered and air-conditioned. Expect about 1 hour to tour the dome."
,,Cool,5.0,,"Wonderful experience, similar to the Eden Project but surprisingly much cooler. Luscious plants, well worth the visit."
,,Could have spent all day here,5.0,,"Our neighbours told us of this place and they were it wrong. The whole thing was fantastic. I took numerous photographs of the orchids and bromiliads and could have spent longer if not for keeping my wife waiting.
Well worth the visit.
The Flower Dome, was fairly blasé after the Cloud Dome."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"It's amazing to see all those plants,flowers and rocks contained in one dome. Experience the rainforest environment when you walk around the bridge and don't miss the video presentation at the end."
,,MUST SEE!,5.0,,It's simply amazing! a must see location. Better to visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. They did an amazing job ther
,,Venus Fly Traps and OtherWorldy Orchids,5.0,,"The top of the Cloud Forest Dome is called ""The Lost World"" and I got lost in this world of orchids, bromeliads, venus fly traps, pitcher plants and more for over three hours. I also enjoyed all of the unique sculptures such as the old truck made up of mosses, asian totem poles, the full vertical wall of orchids, and the five story water falls. There are so many awesome nooks and crannies to this place that even non plant lovers will have an amazing time in this unique glass conservatory. Allow plenty of time for the Cloud Dome and study up on your orchids because this dome houses over 30 species of orchids alone."
,,View from the mist,5.0,,"It's amazing what they have done here, a very interactive and educational experience for all the family. A good reminder that we can all do our bit for the environment. Do check out the rest of the area as well."
,,Amazing cloud forest reconstruction (not for the acrophobic). Chillier than outside so bring a sweater!,5.0,,"This is an amazing reconstruction of an actual cloud forest environment - so it will feel chilly and damp inside compared to the heat and humidity of outside. You may want to bring a cardigan/sweater if you've been wandering around in t-shirts.

After initially walking round the base of the waterfall you take a lift to the top and then begin your descent. Ok, you know you are in an artificial dome but it looks absolutely amazing and the flora are truly fantastic. There are also some fabulous displays of quartz and other minerals.

I was also really impressed with the exhibition/film at the end of what a +5°C climate change world would be like. Worth saving a bit of time for that.

Practical hint - you enter the dome on the ground floor but before that you have to go up to the first floor to buy your ticket. If you're not a Singapore resident then you have to buy a combined ticket for the Cloud Forest and Flower Domes (was about 28 SGD, I think?). Anyway, both are great and worth seeing so wasn't an issue for us.

Finally, not a negative point but do be aware that the walkways are quite high and narrow. One of my friends is acrophobic and had to leave, so worth checking with your companions beforehand whether anyone has a problem with heights."
,,Vertical garden,5.0,,It is great from the engineering point and also the variety of plants especially the pitcher plants.
,,""" Just brilliant""",5.0,,"Get out of the heat of the day and be inspired,learn,and feel sad that all countries are not taking note from Singapores brilliant ideas.So well done."
,,What a treat!,5.0,,Who would have thought we could have experienced this? A fabulous place to enjoy amidst the city. Loved it!
,,Amazing,5.0,,WOW What an experience. Fantastic from beginning to end. The engineering behind this structure is fantastic and gives us a real feel of rainforest and waterfall. A must see for everyone.
,,A lesson in sustainability,4.0,,"We visited the cloud forest dome in gardens by the bay. When I entered the dome, I was wondering about all the energy needed for maintaining the domes climate. As you go to the top and start walking down floor by floor, you realise what a wonderful job has been done by using a bio mass heat generator and absorption refrigeration system to reduce dependency on the grid. The show on global warming is excellent and needs to be viewed by everyone. A must see for those who do not understand technology, too."
,,Great spot to take visitors,5.0,,Lovely spot to cool down and wander the gardens built on a mini mountain. Lovely waterfall too. Nice to include on a trip to Gardens by the Bay
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"By first look, I thought there is not manything to see cuz it quite not big. But I'm wrong. Smart design and architecture is amazing. Good educate about how to be friendly with environment. Suitable for everyone, they notice to design suitable for disable."
,,The Earth within earth!,5.0,,"I can say...when God'S created Human...they become Smart! Human invented Forest a man made earth with earth. The temperature very cooling, the plant are the endanger plants, now day almost you can't find it.but here at Cloud Forest. The design are very earthy and most of the orchid are very beautiful."
,,"Stunning, innovative, and delightful",5.0,,"This is an absolutely stunning feat of engineering: a jewel of a micro-world. Walking in from the hot, humid Singapore summer gave us a real treat. Your first view is of a crashing waterfall with cool spray, and every turn as you walk up and down reveals more wonders. I was particularly enthralled by the explanation (near the end) of some of the engineering details on which the structure was built, as well as its connection to the towering sky trees. Definitely worth seeing if you're in this city!"
,,Night Safari worth a visit,5.0,,"Good entertainment, get there early. Next time I would get there myself as our organised tour was nothing but a hassle and you need more time there than allowed. Be prepared for a crowd."
,,A superb experience,5.0,,Visiting both the domes and the adjoining gardens should be a must stop for all tourists to Singapore. A truly amazing place.
,,Lovely and refreshing,5.0,,"A wonderful sight to see, when the heat gets to you, and you want a breather. The domes at gardens by the bay provide respite from the heat, even if this one still has some humidity to spare. Kids love this one too, as it has a cool massive waterfall to enjoy."
,,Cool and Refreshing,5.0,,"We thought coming from Queensland that this would be like a terrarium and hot inside - what a refreshing change! Once we walked in, we were surprised by the waterfall and how cool it was. A great way to spend a couple of hours out of the heat. The plants on display were impressive."
,,Amazing piece of engineering,5.0,,Well worth the entry fee. Take the time to walk all the way to the top for amazing views. And stop to look closely at all the different kinds of plants.
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,I have two times came to this place. Never boring. Even it is virtual but very natural. Teach us to keep eco green. The dome is covered by so many tropical forest. Love this place and I will come back to this place when I am in Singapore again.
,,"Cool Experience, Literally & Figuratively",5.0,,"Upon entry into the Cloud Forest dome, one will not be able to help but get awestruck by the man-made waterfalls.This faux-mountain is just imposing, and the fact that it is covered by typical forest vegetation is indeed impressive.

Other than the plants, the stalactite/stalagmite exhibit was also nice. I love that the dome also has an arresting AV presentation just before you exit; it's a great way to impart knowledge to visitors about what the future might hold for the earth and us humans in the face of global warming.

This climate-controlled dome mimics the environs of cloud forests that can be found in mountains in the tropics, so bring a light jacket when you visit if you are the type who easily gets cold."
,,South Bay Gardens,5.0,,The two domed enclosures are well worth a visit if for no other reason than they are in a cool environment. They are a little expensive but well worth the visit. My wife and I spent a good 2 hours in the two plus a very nice cup of tea in the small coffee bar. The rest of the gardens are free and delightful to wonder around with a stunning view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
,,I didn't stay there more than 30min,3.0,,"I came out very fast, it wasn't really worth it. I felt I was paying way too much to see flowers artificially mounted on a water cascade! Maybe because I love real nature, hiking and seeing flowers as they are in nature, not only I was not moved and touched by this attraction but it also disgusted me.

If I can recommend what I felt was my biggest surprise in Singapore, that's the Chinese and Japanese garden. Free entrance, big park, nice pagodas, real river going through, Tiare flowers on trees. That's what I look for !"
,,GREAT PLACE TO VISIT,5.0,,"Very different, well worth going.. takes a while to get around as there are several floors to cover and each takes you to a different zone of the mountain."
,,Go There!!!,5.0,,"Floriade, well known by the Dutch, is beautifull, but this dome is so much better, impressive, huge, colorful, in short: A must see!!
I spoke with many locals and was flabergasted that they hadn't been there. These two dome's are really worth visiting. So pay the entrance fee to go inside and admit I was right."
,,Nice and Cool Inside,5.0,,"Must go here and may the $15.00 entry. great waterfalls and plants to see. well worth the visit. also see the flower dome as well, you will love it"
,,Awesome.....,5.0,,This is a must visit. It's something totally different. As you enter you are welcomed with a spray of mist from the waterfalls.The kids absolutely loved it. Its a walk all the way to the top or lift if you prefer. Along it lots of flowers and photo opportunity. There's also a crystal rock collection and a video show named +5 Degrees which is very interesting.
,,GVFM,5.0,,"Good value for money The flowers in the dome are beautiful, and the temperature a welcome break from the heat to enjoy strolling around enjoying them"
,,Quite a surprise.,3.0,,"Once you got through the entry and the waterfall it was quite awe inspiring. The concept was fascinating. And walking round the spire footpaths gave plenty of scope for great photo opportunities. The top pathways seemed to intimidate those with vertigo phobias but you could take a lift directly down if was a problem. There were lots of colourful displays and some large areas of ecological/climate presentations. Ideal for adults and children. Children seemed to love ""just happening to walk through the waterfall""!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"I am Not a fan of ""tourist attractions"" but this place is gorgeous . On top of all the beautiful things to see and photo, there are ECO lessons which I thought was really cool. I think small children would be bored here, but for friends, couples, or families with older children this would be great."
,,Cool,4.0,,"beautiful, the air, the view, the scene, the waterfall.. but i'm too tired for exploring each level. pass them by the lift.."
,,Wonderful experience every time,5.0,,When we moved to Singapore from UK I joined the Friends of the gardens and have enjoyed visiting regularly and most recently delighted to take friends there. The architecture and construction of the building and the views are just wonderful even without the beautiful flowers and plants and the ever changing atmosphere. A cooling breather from the heat of the city.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,My favourite of the two domes. A unique concept of aerial walkways around a planted waterfall. Great photo opportunities. Might be a challenge if you don't like heights.
,,Beautiful blooms abound!,5.0,,"I am not an avid floral lover but the Cloud Dome had me enthralled. The variety of plants were staggering as was the towering waterfall. The air conditioning can be a tad chilly so a light jacket wouldn't go astray. For lovers of orchids,as is my husband, this place is heaven. Amazing and worth the entry fee."
,,"Worth a visit, especially to get away from the heat",4.0,,"Beautifully manicured garden beds and gently sloping walkways to the top.
Variety of flower is staggering and the 360 degree views especially back to the city are worth the entry alone.
Not all that cheap ($28 Sing from memory) but its a good 1-2 hours in a cool atmosphere.
Look out for the bridal photo parties, they are everywhere."
,,Beautiful Waterfalls,4.0,,Never thought I'd climb a waterfall - this was absolutely amazing and refreshing! Ride to the top and walk all the way down and around the falls to the bottom - enjoy the flora and the views.
,,worth it,5.0,,"i wasnt sure what to expect, but the domes over by marina bay sands are interesting and cool (literally, they are airconditioned)"
,,Lovely cool atmosphere,4.0,,"It was lovely to go inside this dome and be greeted with the giant waterfall. There is plenty of opportunities for good photos with great backdrops. On a hot afternoon it is definately the place to be, The air conditioning is awesome. Definately worth a visit"
,,Relaxing stroll,5.0,,"I love the Gardens by the Bay and it's two domes of which Cloud Forest Dome is one.
The whole area is so spacious, green and well-designed. There is beautiful architecture (the domes and the super trees). Also the suspension bridge at sunset is really nice."
,,Futuristic garden,5.0,,"This was a very unique experience in Singapore. I thoroughly enjoyed this oasis among the heat and humidity outside. I felt as if I had entered the movie Avatar. The beautiful orchids hanging from the wall are not to be missed. As you begin to exit to the building there is informational entertainment about environmental issues, which is a great way for kids to learn. I definitely suggest a visit if in Gardens by the Bay."
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,"This showcasing the type of flora growing solely in high altitude mountain regions was spectacular. Upon entry into the dome the waterfall and the conditions of the 'forest' are stunning. The walkway to the amazing cloud forest was incredible with many gorgeous plants on show.

Once again a couple of hours spent here is a must to appreciate the miracles of this forest."
,,Cool Cloud Forest,5.0,,"This is a Singapore ""must see"", along with the Flower Dome nearby. You will need at least a couple of hours to see both depending on visitor numbers. We visited early morning to avoid crowds and outside heat and humidity. If you have a Singapore Airlines Boarding Pass stub you get a small discount on the entrance ticket. Inside the dome it is beautifully cool with slight mists from the stunning waterfall just inside the entrance. Exotic plants cover the structure of the waterfall right up to the roof. Go up in the lift to the top, then descend down again by walkway around the waterfall. Lovely photo opportunities from every level. There are gift shops in the complex. Worth exploring both as one of them had additional items of interest and also had a nice coffee shop tucked away beside it. If you don't have much time to spare taking public transport to this venue, taxis are plentiful and not expensive and will save you a lot of legwork."
,,Stunning location,5.0,,Wow!!! This Cloud Forest is a highlight. Crazy what man can build and cool how you can explore the whole dome. Even if there are many people in the Cloud Forest Dome you still have the feeling to be alone as there are different levels and ways to walk. Stay here for 2 hours plus.
,,Man made forest - beautiful,5.0,,Do visit this place for sure... The best time is day rather than night as you can explore & capture pics of the artificial made forest.... Must visit...!!
,,garden plus,5.0,,"Liked- parklands with light show, chilli crab, pandas at the zoo,public transport-cheap clean and on time.Changi war museum,friendly & efficient service when shopping, no hawkers constantly hassling you Dislike- humidity, cost of living not cheap anymore"
,,fantastic,5.0,,"gardens by the bay cloud dome so worth it. It is a marvellous piece of what man and nature can do, the structure, the plants,the high, the imagination all wonderful. Some stunning plants and an indoor waterfall"
,,Heavenly,5.0,,"This place is so beautiful! I would go back here in a heartbeat.. The place is just well designed and there are a variety of flowers and plants, The place was so cold! Yet amazing!"
,,Extraordinary dome,4.0,,Even though it was not as exciting as it appers in the pictures it was worth a visit. The tour is very structured and there are several levels which is a very extraordinary way to see green!
,,It is an incredible place,5.0,,"The first thing you see is the huge water fall, cascading down a wall of plants. I took the elevator to the top and came down by the winding walkway. Great photo opportunities."
,,Better than Eden,5.0,,"the Eden project, that is. Understandably this is much better than the similar build in Cornwall - they have better weather in Singapore for a start. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit - all interesting and exceptionally well done."
,,"Great exhibition, must visit",5.0,,"The forest is quite big, you'll need more then an hour to see everything. There is an elevator that takes you up to seventh floor. Tickets could be bought for 2 parks only - Cloud forest and Flower Dom, price - S$26 per adult. I really enjoyed the park and would recommend to visit it to the others."
,,Orchids!,5.0,,The bromeliads and orchids are magnificent. There is a mist system to keep the humidity high...like a cloud. The waterfall is wonderful. Can get crowded if you go on a weekend or public holiday.
,,Gardens,5.0,,This is worth a look at it is excellent and well done. Close to the city and if you get the correct hotel you can see then at night with all the lights on
,,Amazing,5.0,,I don't know his brain child this was but it is fascinating to go through. The whole Gardens in the Bay us full of surprises and it's educational and makes you think
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens By The Bay complex by Marina bay and close to the Singapore Eye. We spent an afternoon in the Gardens and the Cloud Forest Dome was the highlight. Firstly it is an amazing feat of engineering, the scale is much larger than I thought. The forest dome is several hundred feet tall, with waterfalls and walkways all over. You can walk, up, down sideways wherever you want. The star of the show is the fauna, it is nice to see what plants grow in such a warm and humid environment.
Not a cheap excursion by any means but still well worth it. The Gardens are free it is only the domes you pay for. There is a good souvenir shop there also."
,,Nice visit,4.0,,"During a visit to the gardens by the bay I visited the flower dome and cloud forest to, personally I found the flower dome not particularity spectacular but the cloud forest was nice.
It´s a lushes green indoor mountain with lots of beautiful (jungle) plants, waterfalls and a sky trail.
Was a nice visit would advise anyone in Singapore to go visit but myself would prefer ´real´ nature like the Mcritchie trail over it. Even more cheaper to visit to ;-)"
,,Walking in the Air,5.0,,"What a fantastic experience!! The cloud dome is an incredible piece of engineering with a display of plants that will take your breath away!! Greeted by the vision of a 200 foot waterfall as you enter the dome the sights to see just keep on getting better. To top it all, there is an AMAZING walkway down - or indeed up - that goes out into mid-air so that all the incredible plants can be admired from a distance. I would say: "" don't miss it!! """
,,it was nice to see,4.0,,"Worth seeing, a large variety of exhibits.Take your camera It is expensive re entrance fees to both domes. the gardens around the domes are free to see"
,,Spectacular gardens,5.0,,"Very easy to navigate, pram & wheel chair friendly, no rush. I scared of heights, but had no problem using the walkways."
,,Neat Experience and Pretty,3.0,,"We went to the Cloud Forest Dome one evening and had a very nice stroll about the property. It's quite pretty and was something unique to see. The views from the Dome of the city and the harbor were very pretty. Admission was somewhat price at 25 Singapore, but it was a cool thing to see. At night the dome is and cloud forest is lit up, which is really cool. The flowers were very pretty. Overall, we were glad we did the gardens and cloud forest, but I don't know if we would do it again."
,,Airconditioned forest - can watch once,4.0,,"We visited this place in Oct 2013. The feel of a forest in the city is a cool one. It is like a forest which is airconditioned, typically like some hollywood set. But the plants and the water fall are amazing."
,,Climate Controlled Awesomeness,5.0,,Escape the heat and hit the Cloud Dome. The waterfall and views of the Marina Bay are worth the time and effort.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit - really well done and not overly expensive an incredibly engineering feat.
,,The most impressive Green House I've seen,5.0,,The cloud dome is my favourite part of the Gardens by the bay Great atmosphere and story with a purpose.
,,Misty waterfall,4.0,,"Cool oasis in the heat of Singapore, take your time wandering around Beautiful flowers and trees Good value"
,,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,4.0,,Very well made and presented. The details are well written for visitors to read & become aware. Does not feel that you are in the midst of a city.
,,Gardens By the Bay - Clod dome,4.0,,"Great spot very beautiful and well designed. Located in the Gradens by the Bay, Well worth a visit alughth they do charge an entry fee"
,,Unique experience.,4.0,,Very enjoyable if you like plants. A one-of-a-kind place to visit. The high walk ways were a bit scary if you don't like heights. Lovely and cool on a stinking hot day.
,,Cloud Forest - One of the very good attractions at Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is part of the Gardens by the Bay experience at Marina Bay. Ticket price is SG$12 per adult or SG$18 w/ entrance to the Flower Dome. This is a very interesting place to visit for nature lovers or those interested in seeing an artificial mountain with flora in the middle of the sprawling city.

Here you can see a towering mountain and a 35 meter man-made waterfall producing a lot of mist as you begin your journey within this cool-moist climate. This dome features plant life from the tropical highlands environments, where cloud forests are commonly found.

At the Cloud forrest, you take the lift to the top of the mountain and then descend down a creatively designed footpath which transverses through and around the mountain. This affords you many different viewpoints and perspectives of the mountain itself. The mountain walls are actually planted walls and full of life so there are still lots to inspect here, and we liked the ferns, pitcher plants and wild orchids found.

We spent around 45 minutes in the Cloud Forest but could have easily been there longer. Note that photography can be a bit more tricky here due to the misty climate.

Overall, we very much enjoyed visiting the Cloud Forest when spending time at Gardens by the Bay and highly recommend buying the combination ticket so you can spend time in this attraction when there.

Hint: There are many other attractions you can see when at Gardens By the Bay. Some of the attractions are free to visit while others require tickets. Visit the website for details for various attractions.

Hint: For those planning to spend a day in Gardens by the Bay, we would suggest visiting the 2 conservatories during mid-day as they climate controlled and very cool inside. Then you can explore the other open areas in the earlier and/or later parts of the day. Stay til around 8pm for the light show in the Supertree Grove (1st one at 745pm, 2nd at 845pm).

Hint: There are plenty of dining options available at the Gardens by the Bay for those interested in making a longer visit here. Again, see the Gardens by the Bay website for available dining options."
,,Excellent,4.0,,Breathtaking is just about how I would explain the feeling we got in this attraction absolutely terrific
,,An enjoyable cool walk in the afternoon,4.0,,"Took my 9-yr old niece to visit this place and we had a good time looking and learning about the different types of plants that grow at different heights. Unlike the flower dome which has specialised exhibition from time to time, cloud forest dome displays are rather permanent. Nonetheless it's still worth a visit at least once."
,,Interesting and informative rain forest attraction,4.0,,"Interesting and informative rain forest attraction explaining facts about forests and wild life in the area. Recommend going at evening / night time where they have light shows on, thought that was beautiful."
,,Cool relief from tropical heat,5.0,,"The cloud forest is about 15 mins walk from the closest train station, at Bayfront. Expect to face tropical sun along the path as there is an open field to pass before arriving at the gardens.

Upon entering the dome, temperature drops 15ºC and humidity goes up as we were greeted by a foggy man-made hill and waterfall. The dome is quite educational and gives young and old exhibits to enjoy.

A good spot to bring your date in the evening too as the lights come on."
,,Marvel !!!!,5.0,,"It's a master piece of architecture , landscape and engineering. Must visit.
Plan to visit when it's not sunny for best experience. When visited on a sunny day or at noon you may loose the fun of experiencing clouds itself . Plan it on a cloudy day or in evenings just before sunset . It's fun and truly a marvel . Must visit for any one visiting Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,Very good experience! Very nice walk with a beautiful flora. It is a must see at the Gardens by the Bay!
,,Amazing landscape,5.0,,"Great landscape, Good ambience and very clean forest. All plants were amazing and the rainfall were amazing."
,,Another Nice place to visit in SG for the 1st timer,4.0,,"another nice place to visit in SG for the 1st timer, so far nothing changed since my 1st visit.
I kept revisit when frens fr overseas visit SG.

nice fountain, nice coolling place, nice view on the walking path @ the lost world.

its something different compared to visit botanic garden ;)

i like it very much but if no new things implemented ... it may not be that attractive anymore for revisit."
,,A walk in the clouds!,5.0,,"If you want to experience a full hill station experience with ferns, begonias, fuschias etc along with nippy, misty climes! MUST DO!"
,,Such attention to detail,5.0,,The best thing about this place are the gems that you must pay attention to spot amidst the myriad of foliage. Tiny orchids that peek out from weird and wonderful greenery! The bridge walk is breathtaking in terms of both height and the views you can enjoy as you leisurely stroll through. Always have an extra battery and storage devise on hand coz you will run out before you even finish exploring half the garden.
,,One of the 10 Must-Visit Places in Singapore,5.0,,"We visited the Cloud Forest Dome with no expectations and came out in awe! The engineering, concept, visuals, and collection of plants and flora is amazing. Opens your eyes to the wonders of Eco systems and concept is worth emulating. Visit this place and you won't regret it, miss it and you miss an integral part of Singapore. We went on a hop in- hop out bus and it's fantastic!"
,,Artificial but they made it look Natural,5.0,,Whoever visits Singapore surely need to visit Gardens by the Bay. Ask your agent to get the tickets for the cloud Forest which gives you an excellent forest kind of feel. great .
,,A must visit!,5.0,,Unlike anything I've seen. Visited in afternoon and enjoyed it so much I squeezed in another visit in the evening. Awesome experience!
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Its a very pretty green house park. Nice view, good for educational trip for children. I love the way they keep it clean n comfortable to walk around."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"What a brilliant concept to make an inside garden,accessible in all weather.The setup of this dome is quite breathtaking for any gardener and should be on every greenfingers bucket list.the flowers and ferns and waterfalls,too beautiful!!"
,,Outstanding attraction,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay is one attraction in Singapore that should not be missed. In our opinion the Cloud Forest Dome was the highlight. It is beautifully constructed and made us feel as though we were back in the Monteverde Cloud Forest in Costa Rica. Take the lift to the top and stroll down, admiring the tropical plants and flowers as you go. It is cool inside and a welcome respite from the tropical heat of Singapore."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"What a great place-a short cab ride from the CBD - note to all travellers in Singapore , it's safe an cheap to jump in a cab-thy won't rip you off.

Loads to see-think the Eden centre in Singapore and you're not far off but being singapore its air conditioned!

Food court on site is good-you have to try the satay stall"
,,Worth it,5.0,,Closest thing to the Lost World most of us will see. Amazing engineering. Beautiful plants. Loved it.
,,Best air-conditioned site in Singapore!,5.0,,Mind-blowing that they could create this in such a tropical envornment and yet make it appear so natural-plus a great place to escape the heat!!!
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Its beautiful. Beware, it can be pretty chilly inside especially when they mist the whole place up. Love the waterfall and the walk ways and how they planted the plants all along the waterfall structure."
,,Unexpectedly cool and lush,4.0,,This was a great way to kill a couple of hours whilst on business in Singapore. It was pleasantly cool inside and the whole mountain inside a dome was very pleasing.
,,Glad I went to the Dome,5.0,,"Really great fun, very well made. The whole structure is worth the effort. Rarely you can see this kind of nature dome so beautifully arranged and well kept. If you have a hot afternoon in Singapore spend a few hours here. Perfect for great photos and the whole family with children"
,,"A great venue to cool off while enjoying a spectacular ""mountain"" walk",5.0,,"This is essentially an artificial mountain, but it is nice and cool in the pavilion and the scenery is spectacular. I recommend as part of a visit to Gardens by the Bay. For just a few dollars more, you can also enjoy the Flower Garden Pavilion next door."
,,Refreshing !,4.0,,"We came to Gardens by the bay after Jurong Bird Park and were bit tired. The Cloud Forest dome with the mist from the waterfall was cool and refreshing. We were relieved to find elevators which took us to the top and the walk down hill was very nice - one also gets good view of the city attractions like Marina Bay Sands, Singapore flyer etc. The short video on the ground floor on the impact on our world of 5 degrees temperature increase had an inspiring message for all of us."
,,Best attraction in my book,5.0,,"Coming in to the dome right away you are met with a waterfall this just sets the pace. Part of the gardens by the bay this is the better one, if you do duel ticket go to flower dome first then cloud."
,,Fantastic value for money!,5.0,,Great place to spend the day! Amazing plants and amazing eco ethics. Huge educational value and wonderful to see all the plants from across the globe!
,,Good Experience !,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a part of Gardens by the Bay attraction in Singapore. We got a dual ticket for the Cloud Forest and Flower dome of SGD 25.00 per person.

The Cloud Forest is essentially a man made rainforest environment inside a huge dome. The cool atmosphere is a welcome respite from the humidity outside. One is greeted with a huge waterfall right at the entrance. There are walking platforms imitating something like a cloud walk to explore the whole place. The flora is good, but we saw better at the Orchid Garden and the Flower dome.

Overall, a nice cool place to spend 30-45 mins."
,,This place is very cool; bring families or walk around by yourself!,5.0,,"If you've been to the Eden Project in South England, this is similar and likely better! Definitely go here and plan to spend some time...great way to spend half a day!"
,,The Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Visiting the Cloud Forest did not disappoint. It was cool inside out of the tropical heat and the mist around the mountain was refreshing. The walkways are a little scary to those who are afraid of heights but the beautiful bromeliads, orchids and greenery soon take your mind off just how high you are. The view looking down on the ponds and flowers is beautiful. A lot of thought and planning has gone into design and there is a photograph at every angle. The Crystals display also well done."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Air conditioned peace of heaven. Unique and surprisingly big. a Must visit in singapore and in gardens by the bay
,,Good & Bad,3.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome was filled with little attractions like a miniature unmoving railway and statues. There was quite a poor variety of plants compared to other free attractions in Singapore like the Botanic Gardens. The biggest draw would be the indoor waterfall and cold that was a welcome change from the tropical heat of Singapore.
For that price, I would expect a lot more. Definitely won't be back again."
,,"Out of the world experience, very impressed by thoughfulness",5.0,,"The whole ecosystem of rainforests is recreated in a multistorey cloudwalk, complete with huge waterfall, artificial hills and the scent of a jungle all around.
Accessibility is so well thought through. My entire family loved the experience and I felt like a school student. My personal favorite, please don't return from Singapore without seeing this."
,,Unmissable,5.0,,An amazing experience. The walkways give a chance to see so much up close. Not to be missed. Jjust go!
,,WOW !!!!,5.0,,"I never knew a man made attraction would look so wonderful. The moment you enter the dome, a huge, very huge man made waterfall welcomes you. This was so wonderful with all its variety and displays, we didn't want to leave soon..."
,,Lovely,5.0,,It was amazing. Not just the array of plants/flowers but the science of how it is powered. We spent a few hours walking around both domes and this was my favourite. They offer earphones to hear commentary .be aware just like everything in Singapore it is expensive.
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"Wonderful plants, great to visit when its the middle of the day to cool off and wander around. Loved the walkways and the orchids were amazing. Beautifully put together."
,,Great waterfall,5.0,,We went early in the day and there were no lines. The waterfall was beautiful and the whole dome was cool and lovely on a warm day.
,,We where in awww so beautiful,4.0,,The gardens inside where so lovely there where piters plants we have never seen and lots of beautiful orchid so worth a look
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is a really amazing place and obviously a lot of planning has gone into the whole place. Worth going for the Baobab trees alone!
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"It is a nice walk around a forest, a little over rated from my point of view. The spectacular thing is how they mede this, the building is breathtaking, the atmosphere created is just as if you were in a mountain, with the temperature and the fog. But if you have the time go for it. Just being in gardens by the bay is spectacular."
,,Awesome place to see,5.0,,"Awesome place for anyone even though you are not that much into ""Green"". The ticket price is worth to the max. This is a must watch.. Don't forget to watch the +5 degree show at the ground after you watch the upper side of the dome."
,,It's okay to see the nature,3.0,,"There is a beautiful waterfall, but I like Flower Dome more. It's cold and a little bit damp. I like the souvenir shop."
,,"Dome, check, mountain, check, waterfall ...",5.0,,"Yes thats right its a 30meter high artificial mountain with a waterfall down the outside and its all inside an controlled air-cooled dome.

The selection of plants in this dome is mainly tropical and that adds to the splashes of extraordinary colour all over the dome and the ""mountain"" walls.

Inside the dome is an elevator that takes you to the top and then you work down and around on a series of ariel walkways.

This is NOT a thing for someone who has problems with heights but it is perfectly safe.

If you want to see plants in a cool atmosphere then this is the place to go."
,,Awesome and cool,4.0,,"A waterfall greets you as you enter and then you can climb up a 'hill', enjoying the view and the flora and fauna. Very impressive and do not go without your camera!"
,,Magnificent insight into rain forest,5.0,,A man made version of a rainforest within a huge dome structure. Great collection of rain forest plants and orchids that can be viewed on an intriguing walk.
,,As good if not better than the SG flyer,5.0,,"One of the top attractions in Singapore. Even better, you don't have to be a greenie, to enjoy this place.

It's a great mix of creativity, architecture and planting. The structure and plants seem to grow together as one. This is a place that has planned to be unplanned. Something bringing organic and concrete together.

Again a great attraction from Singapore, good when it's sunny or when it's raining."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Spent a number of hours at this spectacular facility and one is lost for words how to describe the adventure that you undertake as you make your way around the tree tops and valleys.
Truly magnificient.
We went also to the botanical flower pavilion which was excellent but would recommend this is visited first as its not as spectacular to us anyway as The Cloud pavilion.
A sight not to be missed on a trip to Singapore."
,,Human ingenuity shows nature at its best,5.0,,"Whilst the gardens are beautiful in their own right a visit to the Cloud Forest Dome is the icing on the cake. There is an entrance fee, but it is worth the cost. Centre-piece is a multi-storey man-made mountain with a waterfall tumbling from its summit. Each floor has a different display illustrating the evolution of our planet and the importance of conserving and preserving what we have. Thoughtful displays without being patronising or detracting from the enjoyment of the visit. Do go see."
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,Loved every minute of our visit to this dome. Just an incredible structure and so well laid out. Amazing plants and sights within the dome. Well worth a visit.
,,all perfect as usual for Singapore,4.0,,"so many plants, you should plan at leat 1 hour for this graden of heaven. the waterfall is artificial, but the idea of a giant colums of green is excellent"
,,an amazing indoor garden - recommended,5.0,,"the moment you walk in, you are flabbergasted, because the first thing you see is a green mountain and a waterfall a few stories high - indoor.
the temp. is cool, which is a relief after the all year 32 grad.celcius temp. in Singapore.
in the dome you can see all kinds of plants, especialy the national orchid flower.
it is structured this way that you can basically go round the ""mountain"", untill the very top & feel as if you were in a tropical rain forest - nothing we have ever seen before anywhere in the world.

in the end, there is an educational presentation, where we learn about the global warming effect, the melting of the icebergs, the shortage of water, the extinction of animals & the role the humans play in it...

recommenden to all - children & adults alike."
,,Not worth the entrance fee.,1.0,,"I'm sorry, I want to give this a good review. I really do, but I just can't.

Gardens By the Bay is beautiful! I love the Supertrees and walking around the outside gardens is fantastic. But when it comes to the ""Cloud Forest Dome"" I just don't get it… In fact, I more than ""don't get it"" I am super disappointed and somewhat embarrassed that they would charge people money to see what they've created; which is a man-made waterfall. That's it. That's all. A huge monstrous structure covered in moss, flowers, and various plants that spouts water. For the fee of S$12.00 (local resident) you get to walk up and around the structure. I'm sorry, but it's not worth it. I'd rather keep my money and go eat at one of the awesome food centers down by the Supertrees.

*You can pay a ""joint"" fee and get the ""Cloud Forest Dome"" and the ""Flower Dome"" together for S$20.00 (local) S$28.00 (visitor), But I still think it's a rip-off. Just pay for the ""Flower Dome"" if you're interested - at least that exhibit has actual plant-life worth seeing."
,,Loved it,5.0,,This place is an amazing oasis in the city. It has the most amazing cool air conditioned space with a beautiful waterfall
,,Experience,4.0,,Different experience !!! Great structure and well maintained to give lot of information to visitors. Good place to give young kids knowledge about environment and climate changes
,,Incredible !!!,5.0,,"Woow... man can do a lot of things....
its great to see the beauty of diff flowers, trees & plants under the Cloud Forest Dome....
Its beautiful and u can just stop admiring the time and efforts that must have been put up to create it...
a great place to visit"
,,How many OMG momenta can one have???,5.0,,"You HAVE to go here....this place is stunning....particularly if you like flowers or gardens! It was the first day do our 3 month holiday...and we basically filled the memory card in our camera! What more can we say? One more thing is that it was such a relief from the heat to walk into the beautiful misty, watery environments....."""
,,Nice but not impressive,3.0,,"It is a nice garden area to walk around in, offering a broad range of plants from around the globe. Nevertheless, the entrance fee too high. Furthermore it is not obvious for me how this area could be so expensive to be built. If you definitely want to go there, regard it as a nice walk. You would not need to go into the two domes paying entrance fee."
,,A must to see when in Singapore.,5.0,,"The two dome, Cloud Forest Dome and Flower Dome, in front of the Marina Bay Hotel is just fantastic. Very nice created."
,,Unusual,4.0,,"Good to see. Very interesting . Lots to see . You have to pay to get into some exhibits, but some are free. Nice way to fill in time. Would be spectacular at night."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Great oasis in busy city. Had lunch in Pollen which was good value for upscale restaurant. He dome did make me think of Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi though!
,,MUST SEE,4.0,,"My advice would be to see the Cloud Forest before the Waterfall. Because it's so hot in Singapore, the waterfall would be so refreshing after the hot walk around the gardens.. Great toilet facilities - very clean - well appointed."
,,Beyond gardens!,5.0,,"If anyone tells you to visit the Gardens By The Bay--and you answer--they are ""just gardens""--you need to go and be overwhelmed. These take the concept of green structures to a whole new level. What a wonderful place to explore in the Singapore heat! Definitely worth the visit."
,,"Ok, but very expensive for the money",3.0,,"It cost us $16 a ticket (Singapore dollars) to tour the cloud forest. The most impressive part about this is the building the cloud forest is in, very cool architecture. However, the actual forest was overrun with tourists and clearly orchestrated to be a tourist trap. I could see it being fun for little kids to wander through, but I enjoyed the Botanic Gardens much more than this."
,,Simply Amazing!,5.0,,"Went with my toddler with stroller in tow. Unique experience. It was easy to get around and feel the mist upon entry. Once you get to the top taking the lift, it was nice for my son to easily stroll down with me while enjoying the breathtaking view as we walk around our way down the waterfall. Would revisit again soon!"
,,Worth watching again & again,5.0,,Was overwhelmed on entering Cloud Forest. Waterfall is breathtaking with plants that one could see only in rain forest. Very well maintained & to see pitcher plant was icing on cake.
,,Nature with an eye,5.0,,A wonderful trip to feel Nature with human efforts. Its better if you go with family or friends .there is lot to enjoy.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"After recovering from the surprise of a very wet entrance, this was an amazing and fascinating building. The walkways took you ever higher until you were behind the waterfall which faced you as you entered the dome. Once again, beautiful plants and views"
,,magical place,5.0,,"SG was very hot and the walk from the train station to the domes was not pleasant.. it may very well discourage you from pushing through with ur plans but upon entering and feeling the cool breeze on your hot skin and the sound of the waterfall made the long walk (and the entrance fee) very worth it.. though i was not able to climb to the very top, i enjoyed my tour of the place especially their educational video on climate change.. i lve that it tries to send a message to its visitors, giving awareness to important matters that affect us all.. a definite must visit.."
,,Mountain of awesome!,5.0,,The journey from the top of the mountain to the bottom was well worth the ticket price. Refreshing waterfall and mist in the air to cool you down!
,,Wow,5.0,,"We loved this attraction and spent a lot of time whilst here. The information about our natural habitat and what us as humans are doing to our planet is very informative. The waterfall is impressive too and overall we would recommend this whether it be to escape the heat, or the rain."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Really nice and beautiful walk. Entrance ticket for 1 dome is around 15 SGD, 2Dome-28SGD .We visit both of domes, but Flower Dome wasn't so impressive. Its better to buy just 1 ticket to Cloud Forest Dome and visit some amazing gardens around Singapore for free"
,,Interesting and beautiful,5.0,,"We visited the 'cloud dome' on our trip to the gardens in March this year.
As soon as you enter this spectacular structure you are greeted by a big, manmade waterfall tumbling down from the lofty heights of the dome.
All around you there are beautiful orchards and exotic plants. As you make your way through the various levels of the dome an eerie mist is released creating a lovely effect.
There are statues and bridges, and high metal walkways; flowers cling to the sides of a large central structure which towers to the top of the dome. There is a large pond area surrounded by carnivorous plants.
Everywhere you look there is something new to see!"
,,"Indoors, so good to do when the day is hot",4.0,,"The park leading to the Cloud Forest Dome was very charming. Super easy to get to by subway. We went late in the day, and although there is some lighting within the dome, it was a bit too dark to really see. I would suggest you go when there is plenty of daylight. But the cool air was a blessed relief."
,,Spectacular jungle experience,5.0,,The cloud forest dome is a great walk where you shouldn't be afraid of heights. Great vertical gardens with a spectacular water fall. Great to watch the sun set outside from the tree bridge close by.
,,Interesting but not so natural,3.0,,"This garden building architecture really extraordinary, but inside not so natural, good place for photographer to take macro picture, before go here plan it and check all the attraction time and buy ticket outside, much cheaper."
,,OK,3.0,,Inexpensive and quite a pleasant way to spend some time walking about but not that exciting. Expected more of the night time lights show - it seemed to fizzle out without any finale.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Beautiful experience... Very pleasant and soothing. Nothing that I disliked.... It was like being in a tropical forest... Only man made.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"As in most things Singapore, this place is a delight. Go just for the wonder and joy. We came away feeling we had experienced something special"
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"A very interesting building, well laid out and easy to navigate. Some great photo opportunities. Definitely worth a visit."
,,"Gorgeous, like being in a gallery",5.0,,"I thought this would be overrated but was superb, especially early in the morning. Felt a little nervous on the suspended bridge in a good way."
,,Imaginative and very different,5.0,,"This was a highlight of the many joys in our recent visit to Singapore. The dome is one of three attractions requiring payment in the Gardens by the Bay. It is a comfortable environment including the cooling sense of a tall waterfall, which may make for a welcome relief from the outside heat. However it is primarily a fascinating illustration of imaginative use of technology to display a vast array of plants creating a vast mountain of beauty with surprises in colour and texture around every corner at every level. The views of the city looking outwards are impressive and also give opportunity for interesting photographs. It includes a display of stalactites, stalagmites and amethyst on one level and an educational video about the impact of rising temperatures on the environment.
The dome is well served with lifts, elevators and toilets.
I hope I might have the chance to return to see it again as the plants mature."
,,Must see,5.0,,I enjoyed this place very much as it made one feel close to nature. Make sure to have a lot of memory space in your digital camera :)
,,"Interesting concept, worth a visit",4.0,,"Unusual and have never seen anything like it before. We only had time to visit one of the domes, but it was a cool relief from the heat and very calming in a busy city."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It's beautiful, cleverly laid out gardens from different arrears of the world. Even small areas with hidden treasures, like miniature model animals or coloured crystals in the small cactus gardens."
,,Beautiful cool gardens,5.0,,"Lovely orchids, amazing waterfalls and a beautiful cool break to wander and relax, enjoying the view out of the heat!"
,,Love this place,5.0,,"I've been to the Cloud forest twice now and I love it. Its like being in another world, you can hardly imagine you're right in a bustling city. One of my favourite Singapore attractions."
,,A really cool experience!,4.0,,"As you enter the dome, the first thing that hits you is the spray of ice cold water coming down from the man-made waterfall. The walk up to the top is great and the link bridges are great for photo shoots."
,,Forest in the city,3.0,,"We decided to visit the cloud forest dome during the tulipmania. The admission for two conservatories are lower for locals.

It took us about 15 minutes to walk from the nearest Bayfront mrt station.

Once we entered, we were impressed by the world's tallest indoor waterfall. It was cool and refreshing. The planted walls made me feel like walking in a forest with lots of green round me. It was misty and the floors were wet at some areas, thus do be careful while you enjoy the garden.

We took the lift to the highest point and walked down the skyway admiring the amazing structure.

It is indeed an interesting forest in the city."
,,Very worth seeing.,4.0,,"I would suggest the best time for the Dome and Gardens by the Bay would be before dusk so you can experience the gardens in daylight, the Dome in the dark, and the gardens again in the dark (understand that needs full daylight for the Flower Dome). This is also better in terms of being cooler. Cloud Dome is really worth seeing. If you flew Singapore Airlines, present your Boarding Pass and I believe you'll get a discount on the entry fee. Gardens themselves are free entry.
If you wish to, you can finish up b at the nearby 'Satay on the Bay', but food quality is only average and it was very very busy the night we went (Saturday night)."
,,Just wonderful,5.0,,A must-see. A huge variety of plants in a spectacular setting. It is hard to comprehend that a feature of this magnitude could be created.
,,A misty garden!,4.0,,A great experience with some amazing plants and trees. Plenty to see and also a few places to sit down. The gardens are a great visitor centre and the nighttime music and lights is brilliant.
,,Attractive...,4.0,,"A part of the Gardens by bay.. Very different from the flower dome.. flower dome gives you opportunity of experiencing different colours and variety in flowers.
Here you get to see greenery………. Walls with creepers and different kinds of plants. Waterfall inside the dome is something different.
Overall a pleasant experience."
,,Impressive inside waterfall,4.0,,"Impressive inside waterfall and display of plants. Not as interesting as the Flower dome, but nonetheless a decent attraction"
,,Good,4.0,,Well Maintained rain forest and foliage.. The tree or plant labeling could be a a little better so that we know what we are looking at.
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"Out of the two domes, this was probably my favourite. Not because it was more interesting but it was more enjoyable and tranquil.
Another pleasing aspect was it was more systematic.....you start around the bottom and take the lift to the top and walk down where as the other dome is more like a rat maze and you find yourself going double back to see everything.
You also get the privilage of seeing idiots trying to get their photos/selfies taken at the base of the water fall then squel and squim like little piglets when they get wet - here is a hint for those, look up and have a small guess whats about to happen :)"
,,Eden on Earth!,5.0,,Very well done and wonderful gardens. Beautiful flowers and plants. Eden on Earth! We enjoyed our visit.
,,Knowledge about the world,5.0,,The part I like the most is the presentation room about global warming and statistic of world temperature. It is warning to people to beware more if we still make more pollution.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Like the Eden Project but surprisingly, much cooler. Amazing variety of plants, flowers, carnivorous plants, creepers and such rich colours."
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,Certainly one of the most impressive attractions in Garden by the Bay. The overall structure is already incredible and the environment they have recreated inside is clearly beyond expectations. Very good one!
,,Fabulous gardens and great indoor waterfall.,5.0,,Love Gardens by the Bay. A must see when you're in Singapore. The flower dome is really lovely as well!
,,Pleasant Visit,4.0,,A pleasant walk indoor. Nice and cool. Not too sure how much we learned about the forest but it was a pleasant walk with the family!
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Along with the Flower Dome make up an amazing display of plants, shrubs,trees etc and part of Gardens by the Bay. It is definitely an attraction not to be missed in Singapore. Hours can be spent wandering through both domes and around the gardens, enjoy a meal at on of the restaurants. Then wander over to Marina Bay, a whole day can be spent between these to attractions and its well worth it."
,,Very interesting visit,4.0,,"For me, this was worth a visit. Informative and spectaçular. I expected it to be over humid but it was comfortable. You shouldnot be afraid of heights, though! Brings home the climate change message."
,,Best part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"I think the Cloud Forest Dome is unquestionably the best part of Gardens by the Bay. It is an amazing architectural marvel, but more than that it has a very cold temperature, which can be a nice respite from the Singapore heat and humidity. I enjoyed walking around the Cloud Forest Dome, which has Marina Bay Sands in the background, and there are nice little statues and water features in with the foliage of the dome. You could spend hours walking around here and spot something new every time you walk past. Kids will love it, and if you can afford only one of the domes here at Gardens by the Bay, then I would recommend skipping the flower dome altogether and coming here to the Cloud Forest Dome instead."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,This is the most amazing garden prepared by mankind. Gardens and trees and shrubs all the way up to 7th Floor.
,,l like forest feel,5.0,,fantastic building with forest feel. to avoid disappointment visit cloud forest ( will be closed for maintenance ) better check with their website http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/
,,Impressive,5.0,,My favourite of the two conservatories. A beautiful waterfall whose misty coolness was a welcome respite from Singapore's heat and humidity. An excellent representation of a rainforest with stunning flowers.
,,Good place to spend a couple of hours in the midday heat,3.0,,"Enjoyed the experience, although believe it could be better presented. The information in the dark room (forget the name of it unfortunately) has no logical flow, in fact it's a bombardment of information and you don't know where to look! Enjoyed the climate but believe they could make it more interactive and educational - even for some well-informed adults. Also would be nice if you could walk the entire way up/ down instead of having to take a lift or escalator (we had a young baby so had to use that option)"
,,unmissable,5.0,,"unexpected and fantastic, if only because it is cool there :) loved it, for the plants, the views, the project"
,,Like travelling to a mountain top,5.0,,This amazing structure has a waterfall and lots of levels that feature vegetation from different mountain habitats. The suspended walkways allow a new view of the structure. Great to see global warming implications being made clear in their basement presentation.
,,Cool indoor preserve,5.0,,The indoor waterfall is really refreshing. The walk itself through the treetops is quite nice. The final presentation on global warming is a bit extreme (from a professional scientist who keeps up with the news on global warming). The 5 deg C increase by 2100 described in the presentation is generally not accepted in the community (more like 2 deg C).
,,Best gardens I have been too,5.0,,"Amazing architecture, gardens are indoor which means air con. Was a highlight while staying in Singapore."
,,Clouds and fog,5.0,,Worth a visit. Best thing is once you enter you are right in front of this massive waterfall. Best indoor demonstration of a rainforest I have seen!.
,,Nice place,4.0,,"The indoor waterfall is definitely the highlight of this place. After the waterfall, there are still some other areas of interest like some film shows, slides and exhibits."
,,interesting change in elevations and fake cloud,5.0,,"There is a beautiful waterfall at the entrance and then you get to climb inside the mountain. There are environmental and scientific exhibits inside which is fun for kids. You then arrive at the top of the mountain and walk on these walkways at 2 different levels that go away from the mountain so you are literally walking in the clouds. If you suffer from vertigo, you might not enjoy it, in which case you can go down the elevator. Otherwise intermittently there is mist sprayed around the mountain to simulate a cloud. There are great views from the walkways both inside the Dome and outside to the rest of Singapore. This is not a natural setting, in fact, there were workers changing out some of the dying plants (they are potted individually like in a living wall) but it was an interesting experience and in my opinion better value than the Flower Dome."
,,Good,5.0,,easy to go this dome and has a great city view. Please check opening time- sometimes they may close for filming.
,,Cooling dome,4.0,,"Good place to visit. Feeling cool while looking at the flowers, fountain is definitely a good way to enjoy."
,,In the clouds!,5.0,,"What an amazing dome of wonderful plants. An ABC of plants here! On a hot day come here and enjoy the lovely temp. inside the dome. Singapore has excelled at the Gardens By the Bay, a must see for sure!"
,,A superb experience,5.0,,"For anyone with the slightest interest in gardens, this place will blow you away. Having visited a number of famous gardens around the world, I can only say that this is unique and in itself worth the airfare. Majestic waterfalls, exquisite flowers and generated clouds make this an absolute must"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"An amazing adventure at different levels, accessible by lift if you cannot climb. Walkways behind waterfalls and outside the structure allow you to see the magnificent orchids and flowers that cover the mountain"
,,Nice and Scary,4.0,,We went during the evening. It is really pretty and very well maintained but was a bit scary at night as there was no other visitor apart from 3 of us.
,,Unique Structure!,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome was an interesting structure and nice change from the heat as it was climate controlled.It is set in park lands with lots of green space. There are a few other structures (Flower Dome), as well to tour. Both have an entrance fee. Worth the visit!"
,,Fantastic,4.0,,Set against a back drop of the largest indoor waterfall are hundreds of plants and fauna found in forests
,,One of man made wonders of floral/fauna displays,5.0,,"if you visit Spore, Gardens by the Bay is a must see. Do come in mid afternoon, make sure you bought your tickets online to avoid the long queues. Do visit both domes, give yourslef 45 mins per Dome (or more). in evening, the lights come out on the Supertrees and you will be in for a treat."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"First of all, it offers a cool site to escape the Singapore heat. The place is just amazing. The way they built the ""mountain"" was genius, as it hides the escalators and elevator. Everyone takes an elevator to the top and then walks down a gentle sloping path to the bottom. There are several escalators as well. Anyone can see this place and enjoy it. The flowers are so beautiful. The waterfall makes for quite the entry site. My husband was hesitant at first, but really enjoyed it. We would recommend seeing this."
,,Wow - this was a surprising place.,5.0,,"Had been told that this conservatory was worth visiting, but hearing about it doesn't do it justice. The first view of the tall waterfall is amazing, and the walkways throughout the dome at the different levels are great. The video explaining the effects of global warming is quite alarming, but presents an important message well. The planning behind this dome and the architecture is terrific."
,,What a place!,5.0,,This place certainly has the wow factor when you enter the door! Just loved walking around looking at the plants.
,,Excellent Attraction,5.0,,The dome is not big but you'll definitely enjoy the waterfall there! Remember to buy your ticket from local travel agency. It saves a lot!
,,Very cool,4.0,,Very nice. Went at night so did not see many plants but unreal building. Great waterfall. Part of a lovely gardens area so well worth it for the day. Part if the sia stopover package so great value
,,Amazing structure and plants,5.0,,"This structure is amazing a you enter you see a huge man made waterfall. You then take a lift to the top of the waterfall and wind your way down through the clouds. There are many varied plants at different levels. It is accessible for all as there are ramps and lifts. Anyone afraid of heights may not enjoy the experience walking down but it is worth giving it a try.
You can stay as long as you like and before you leave there is a movie to watch about what could happy to our environment if the temperature is raised by only 5 degrees."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"just relaxing, well priced away from the hustle of Singapore. Would visit again on return. Enjoyed by all the family"
,,Gigantic hothouse,5.0,,A cloud forest in a city! We've been to a real cloud forest and this emulated the real thing without the mud and the oppressive heat. A great way to get the feeling of being somewhere exotic.
,,for the botany lovers,4.0,,"this place is surely a place for those who have great interests to learn about the thousands of varieties of plants, flowers & their origins. Patrons can chose to rent audio equipment which helps them learn in detail about each variety at the seven levels of the cloud forest. For those who miss great waterfalls in this island, this has one to relish."
,,Amazing Place!,4.0,,One of the highlights was the views of the Singapore CBD. Just a beautiful spot. Highly recommended.
,,The ecosystem at the top of mountain with waterfalls,5.0,,This is an excellent attraction. It involves an artificially built mountain top with waterfalls and the plants use this ecosystem including the water mist. Its important that one goes by elevator to the top and then walks down as its very steep and high. the walk down is beautiful and staggering to look down through the grills.must see!
,,Awesome Place in Singapore!,5.0,,"Its awesome!! Wondered how they could manage to build and maintain this place. Really amaze with this dome and the sky walk. If you visit Gardens by The Bay, you should enter this dome."
,,Enjoyed the gardens.,5.0,,"We came to the gardens, expected to stay and hour, we stayed for five. We even came back for dinner in the super tree. Excellent food, the equivalent of some of the best Asian influenced food restaurants I have been to. The squid was th best I have ever had."
,,Interesting and cool!,5.0,,"Beautifully done, kids not thrilled by the prospect of looking at plants but once inside really loved it, especially the cloud forest. Easy to get to and from by taxi."
,,A must do in Singapore.,5.0,,"Like most things in Singapore, this is really well done and is a must see. Recommend doing both domes as they are very different. Take a jacket as they are very cold inside."
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"Easy to get around, beautiful flowers, waterfall and designs. Worth staying out of the singapore sun and being inside this place !"
,,Awesome Garden,5.0,,Amazing.Wondered how they could manage to build & maintain those two domes.Cloud forest & Flower dome inside that wonderful area called Gardens of the bay.Must visit.
,,Eerie after dark,4.0,,"We visited the dome at dusk and then it turned dark a little too fast which gave the whole experience kind of an eerie feel. There are many lights but together with the constant mist and the rush of the purple waterfall we felt as if we were in another, somewhat futuristic world. There are many levels to explore. There are ponds, statues, crystals, hanging gardens, and it is generally wet all over, so be careful not to slip."
,,"Awesome, incredible, definitely worth it!",5.0,,The cloud dome is simply amazing. I would recommend it to any visitors to Singapore. It poops all over the flower dome next door ;)
,,nice,4.0,,the waterfall was a great idea and the suspended bridge as well. I didn't like that they sell tickets even after dark and there is not much to see when it's not natural light..
,,excellent,4.0,,very peaceful and quite place for lover of nature. it is in glass enclosure. they created an atmoshphere like u r near cloud with water droplets falling on ur body. plants and water falls is a sight to watch.visit atleast once.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,If you are planning to go to the Gardens By the Bay then you should definitely go to both domes - the cloud forest one is really interesting with a high walkway that winds down five or six storeys from the canopy to the floor beneath. Great views of Singapore from the top.
,,Visiting another world,5.0,,The domes were the best attraction at Gardens by the Bay. Relief from the humid weather aside. There were beautiful orchids and other plants I have never seen.
,,Cool place to visit located on a hot city,5.0,,"By just looking at the Cloud Forest Dome outside, the architecture is already spectacular but when you go inside, it will leave you breathless. The atmosphere inside was really cool. Apart from the centralized air-conditioning, the waterfalls was amazing as well and it added to the cooler atmosphere.

Taking the elevator at the top and going down one floor at a time is the right way to go in the Cloud Forest Dome. The flora was amazing, you can see how rich in color the plants are. At the top, there is a long pathway which guides you to the different parts of the area. This place may not be for those afraid of heights as the pathway has a net-like flooring so you would see the bottom, though this structure looks very much stable. There is also a man-made fog at the top while you walk the trail which is a nice addition to this place.

I'm not really a plant-person but I would advise those visiting Singapore to include this attraction during their trip. Not to be missed."
,,Marvelous man made rainforest!,5.0,,"We went in from the lowest floor and greeted with the spectacular man made waterfall. It is simply an amazing sight.

Then we made a stroll and took an elevator to the highest floor and slowly walk on the canopy walk. From the top, you can enjoy the beautiful scenes of Singapore.

Highly recommended!"
,,Best of Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,"Loved, LOVED the cloud forest experience! From the moment you enter, it's another world. Amazing technology but the most beautiful plants and flowers. I recommend getting the audio commentary - although they give you the third degree as far as not attempting to steal it! It was a great experience going up to the top of e waterfall and weaving your way down through the forest environment! Also a wonderful break from the horrendous heat and humidity that assaults the senses outside. Wonderful!"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"This is an amazing, impressive flora display. Every turn offers a new view of the plant mountain that is at the centre of this experience. Water is used to great effect to add sounds and atmosphere. Really impressive...unlike anything else I've seen."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"A great place to cool down & enjoy the stunning plants. Even the kids were impressed by it. Amazing views from the top. We visited on a weekend and it was busy, would recommend coming midweek if you can."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Probably the highlight of our Singapore trip. You can see why this won worldwide architecture and tourism awards. It is beautiful, informative and just thoroughly amazing. The best two hours you could hope for. Suitable and fun for all ages."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Cloud Forest Dome is an amazing place and I'm glad we visited. It's nice and cool as well in case you want to escape the burning sun outside. The waterfall is nice and the whole place is very educational. A visit is definitely recommended. We went on a Monday just after lunch and it was nice and quiet, so I guess as it looks popular, a week day visit might be best if you want to avoid big crowds."
,,Cool place to visit,5.0,,The plants and waterfall are amazing. Really is a cool place to escape the Singapore heat. Informative and educational. My tip: Take the elevator to the top and walk your way down.
,,Beauty of nature,5.0,,"If you really love flowers, this is a beautiful place for you to visit! I get to learn a lot of new plants and flowers over here, so you should try to visit too!"
,,Rain forest at its best,5.0,,"This is definitely worth a visit. Your truly feel you are in a rain forest amid all the amazing floral, trees and waterfall. Great views at the top."
,,Amazing man made wonder,5.0,,The mega indoor waterfall and the surounding trees of the cloud forest was great . A wonderfull example of blending nature into modern architecture.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"This is probably everyone's favourite at the Gardens. Enjoy interesting fauna and flora at a nice, cool atmosphere"
,,An amazing man made rain forest,5.0,,There is certainly lots to take in and see at the cloud dome and this is only one of the many things to see at Marina Bay Gardens. There are lots of levels to explore with beautiful plants and flowers if you stay long enough the higher you go you will really think you are in the clouds !! Really worth a visit especially if you appreciate nature.
,,"Cloud Forest wonderful climate, floral, exhibits and water",4.0,,"A must to see. Amazing landscape of floral, trees and waterfall. Cooling climate, plenty of rest and photo locations. The waterfall was great and going to the top is easy. Suspended walk ways give the feeling of walking on air. All glass interior also allowed views of Singapore. To not miss this."
,,Good cool place,5.0,,"If you want to escape from SIN sun , head to this place as it will instantaneously cool you down:). Its amazing how they have replicated this forest with being so close to a real one....good place"
,,Walking in the mist,5.0,,Striking architecture including a very big waterfall. Take the lift to the top before working your way down and ignore those people who insist on doing it the other way round! The views from the top are amazing. Considering this has only been open for less than two years it has a very settled feel.
,,Breathtaking display of high altitude habitat,5.0,,"The glass dome is an architectural feat of great beauty; inside is a carefully structured display of the plant life that you find at high altitude; nestled in between the luscious orchid and bromeliads are some awesome carvings and totems form East Timor and West Papua, which gives sense of Shangri-La. There is also and excellent educational video on the disastrous effects of climate change. If you only do one thing in Singapore, visit Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest Dome. I have been three times!"
,,Educational!,5.0,,"it's not only educational, the spot itself is quite an architectural treat! You learn a lot about the eco-system in various altitudes, regional distribution of certain plants in varieties of terrains. It's definitely is one of the most worth visit places in Singapore."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We were amazed at the concept and construction. This is an amazing garden with so many different plants. It is also a cool place to visit on a hot day. We spent over an hour inside looking at all the wonderful exhibits. A great place for visitors of all ages.
,,Avatar,4.0,,"I went to this awesome man made marvel for the first time during the day... There is a huge diversity and its so nice and refreshing. However the best walk through these avatar like world is at night. The play of lights is just incredible and gives this magnificent world a new life at night. If there is a short breeze, its awesome to be out there"
,,Forest in Town,5.0,,"It is very impressive when you first get into the dome to have this huge waterfall, as if it was real. The exotic, tropical plants are so luxurious. A fantastic world apart in the city"
,,Just Beautiful,5.0,,"I love the whole concept. The sound of the waterfall, the rock displays, the flora with the many tropical plants and the walkways. I really wish they had a walkway to walk all the way to the top instead of it being broken up where we have to take the elevators."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Even my 11yr old son declared it was awesome. It's like setting foot on another planet. Incredibly well done and the high walkways add excitement. Definitely would recommend it.
,,Nice View!,5.0,,Nice to walk around and enjoy the view. There is lots of unique plants and flower that I had never seen before and it is very cooling inside. Interesting trip with my friends and the price is quite reasonable. I will recommend to my friends to this place. And I will go again.
,,Cloud in the forest,5.0,,"The moment I step in, I was so astound by the water fall & the mist. I felt like I was in a cooling forest. There's lot of plant for different level of atmosphere. One of the must visit place."
,,Learn about the forests above the clouds,5.0,,This exhibit walks you above the clouds and shows you how forests live and grow at such altitudes. And how clouds and rain and trees sustain one another. The dome is air-conditioned!
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Fun for kids particularly. The concept is very good and the walkway is really fun. It is very green inside and liked the tropical plants on the ground floor in the midst of all the mist.
,,Another amazing area of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,excellent value for money. A paid area but well worth the money. Wonderful waterfall and tropical gardens. A must when visiting the Gardens by the Bay
,,Cool and amazing,5.0,,Great escape from the heat . Wonderful displays and information. Take your time and read everything .
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"1st thing to hit you here is the cool mist from the tropical waterfall.There are gorgeous orchids everywhere and as you wind around the walkway you come across a different garden,"
,,"wow, a waterfall in a Dome",5.0,,"How can you describe this to someone, We overheard this being said as we entered the dome to be greeted by a waterfall cascading down from the roof. Well its hard, think of misty humid rain forests, think of a riot of colourful flowers and now think of it all presented vertically behind a giant waterfall. I'm not even close to what we saw. You have to go yourselves and see it. The mountain was being misted as we were there so you are looking through fine droplets of water, its on three floors accessed by a lift up and escalators down. There is a skywalk which takes you out over the side of the forest and after you've finished you exit through a basement level garden which again is beautifully done. We found the climate change exhibition moving and worrying. Don't miss any of it."
,,welcome to the amazon!!!,5.0,,"Beautifully made...almost same as a real life forest.. The fog, the drizzles, the waterfall, the 3 floors of crazy forest..the bridges that givens you view from the top gives you an amazing experience.. Ad this as a must see on your itinerary!!"
,,"Refreshing mist, worth a visit",4.0,,"Great view of the Waterfall when you first enter. The cool mist is refreshing compared to Singapore humidity. Some nice views from the top. Went with a group of 3 young kids, my two aged 4 & 6 enjoyed it. We did this dome and the other (which was disappointing). If you are only doing 1 definitely do this 1. Cost is 28 Singaporean dollars for non resident adults, 16 for kids for both domes. Adult price for just this dome is 20. Lift access for kids buggies/ wheelchairs."
,,Misty and vertical plannting,4.0,,Vertical plannting and vertical cultivation may be our future way of food production. The waterfall inside is spectacular. Don't expect a natural rainforest inside.
,,cloud,5.0,,how could one forget the natural scenic visit. it appears God has given us very much in form of natural beauty.
,,only in Singapore,4.0,,"After walking through the Gardens by the Bay we entered the Dome with the cool mist greeting us. You will marvel at the orchids, green jungle plants and waterfalls as you work your way up a series of ramps high above the lower gardens. Worth the entrance fee"
,,It's cool and cold in here...,5.0,,"The water falls is amazing! Though it is artificial but it looks so natural. You have to bring jacket inside or you will get wet. Take time to explore the place. Though we were so tired when we visited the place, but we were refresh upon entering each and every section of the dome! Great value for money.. though it may be pricy when we will convert it to Philippine Peso."
,,A must see in SIngapore!! And great for kids.,5.0,,Absolutely a must see! Our three sons loved the garden domes and all the stunning plants within. It is truly a man made marvel.
,,Epcot done poorly and overpriced.,2.0,,"Extremely expensive and not very well done. In general, the facility appeared to be poorly maintained and lots of infrastructure was visible. The signage was terrible. Would definitely not do this again."
,,Cool!,5.0,,A place you never think it is in Singapore. Breathe fresh air from the trees and plants. Fantastic place.
,,amazing display,5.0,,Thousands of plants put together in an inspiring presentation. The dome is a welcome relief from the Singapore sun in the gardens. It allows views of the city and the plants from many angles with walkways and viewing platforms as well as interesting displays and videos on nature science . a well spent $16.
,,"Great ,Cool but dry",5.0,,This is my preferred option of the Gardens in the Bay area. An inverted dome with all sorts of orchids and other rain forest plants growing inside a glass dome. It is striking and very pleasant in Singapores climate. Enjoy the cool but stay dry and see some beautiful flowers and vegetation at the same time.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We loved this. Even my 14 yer old son was impressed. I am afraid of heights so struggled slightly with the high walkways. However, an impressive wow moment more than once."
,,a pleasure from start to finish,5.0,,"This is an unbelievable experience at gardens on the bay and well worth visit even though you are not mad about gardens,the variety and display of each flower and plant has been so carefully thought out and the views from the top are wonderful"
,,Wow and more wow,5.0,,"Worth the high charge - the waterfall is truly amazing and the walk down from the top on the outside scary and exciting.
Plan to spend a couple of hours as its really interesting.
Go next door to the flower dome as well worth another hour at least."
,,Beautiful place,3.0,,"Beautiful yet nothing much you can see in there , the waterfall area is cooling as well as the top touring the place can be fast as there isnt much of my interest there"
,,Amazing sensory experience!,4.0,,"One of the greatest cloud domes I have ever seen! Not only interesting and well designed, but well incorporated into the Gardens in the Sky!"
,,What a beautiful creation,5.0,,It is amazing. They have created an environment just like a natural forest. Very................ beautiful . Nice climate too although it is not natural. A must see attraction in Singapore. It is very easy to reach here by MRT - Bay Front.
,,Such and amazing pLace,5.0,,We loved the water fall and the freshness as you enter this exhibit. The vertical gardens were stunning. So many orchid and tropical plants that were spectacular. It was an easy walk but for elderly there was a lift available too. The village with the train was great as well it's a model but the children loved it. Several pieces of art sculpture were amongst the plants too which added to the ambience. Highly recommend.
,,Cloud Dome,5.0,,Fantastic. Not to be missed by anybody visiting Singapore. What a great experience this was. The highlight of our visit.
,,Amazing & beautiful!,5.0,,This is one place which shows how Singaporeans are dealing with limited space and increasing pollution. A beautiful vertical garden with waterfall. Very refreshing experience. Tickets are bit expensive but then it is Singapore :-)
,,Great vertical garden,4.0,,"The place is also a dome like the ""Flower Dome"" but there is a very big vertical garden like a mountain with a big waterfall. You can see several types of flowers and plants species in this small ecosystem. You can go up and down inside the forest to find expositions and animal life explanation boards. As in the flower dome, this place is cold due to the air conditioning system. Buy a combo ticket to see the flower dome because it is kind of expensive."
,,Great part of Bayside Gardens,4.0,,"Along with the Flowe Dome, the Cloud Forest Dome is a very impressive part of the Bayside Gardens. The garden is beautiful - with many orchids and other lush plants together with a waterfall and suspended walkways. Worth viewing."
,,Worth the price of admission,4.0,,"Both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome are worth a visit, the quality, quantity and variety of the exhibits is very impressive. Go there if you enjoy nature; you'll forget it's all a bit artificial very quickly."
,,Bizarre but awesome biodome,5.0,,"I felt like I was in a retro future walking through this place. But it was pretty awesome. Imagine yourself in the most serene sci fi nature simulation built in beautiful architecture and that's what you get!

It's a nice moment in cooler air from the heat.

I loved the flower done the most. Like being in a museum of art, but of flowers of course. The succulents were mind blowing."
,,A lovely cool oasis,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome is a definite must for sight-seers in Singapore. It is hot and humid outside, but inside is cool and tropical and just lovely. There are beautiful flowers and plants everywhere. Lots of cool photo opportunities. The dome is located in the area of the Gardens by the Bay so there is a lot to do. Between this and the Supertree Grove, we had a pretty entertaining half day of sightseeing. Definitely recommend it."
,,Amazing waterfall,5.0,,"The waterfall is amazing, i hate height but this one is cool. It was raining outside when i went there, so the air is so cold, and feels like in the forest with mist and clouds around"
,,Imressive space,5.0,,"I never seen such a hytechnology botanic theme doom. I was so surpised. Especially, waterfall on the entrance was impressive. Temperature is ideal to walk around. So there is good place to see for older people and chirdren."
,,You must visit!,5.0,,"As I stated under the Gardens on the Bay review this was a highlight in our visit. We loved this dome, so well thought out and great views from everywhere. Not good though if you hate heights,"
,,Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,Excellent features and well worth the time to visit. It is easily accessed but may be a problem if you do not like heights.
,,See it the light and at night.,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay, one of the Bio-domes. Make sure you see it both in daylight and in the dark.

Ensure you do all the walkways, including right up the top. You not only get the feeling of being up a tropical mountain, you can also see the fantastic views. Where else in the world would you ever see so many ships at once?"
,,Not what I expected,5.0,,On a hot and sticky day I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere inside the dome. It was wet and humid and I loved it. Take the lift to the top of the falls and meander down the walkway to the very bottom. Semi scary on the descent and you have to be careful you don't slip but very enjoyable
,,Float above the ground in the Clouds,4.0,,Visited this while at Gardens by the Bay. Really worth the visit. Walkway high above the ground let you seen things from a different perspective. Flowers are beautiful. Loved the Train and the Car with the moss growing on it. don't miss this while in singapore
,,Our visit,5.0,,You need a good day to enjoy the marvellous domes and surrounding gardens if visiting Singapore you must add to your must sees
,,Inspiring,5.0,,I love the statues from East Timor that are all over and the waterfall at the entrance. Even my baby loves the waterfall!
,,Indoor rainforest,5.0,,"Where can you see a Waterfall, Fog, Mist and Cloud all under one roof? This is definitely a place to amaze even the most no-so-nature-loving dude."
,,Now this was a revelation,5.0,,"Known more for its uneasy relationship with democracy, for making lots of people lots of money and for being a nation with famously harsh laws Singapore isn't really known for its nature (outside of the zoo). This wonderful attraction - along with its neighbour the Flower Dome and the surrounding Gardens by the Bay seems part of an attempt to soften the image of the place.

And what a way to do it. This dome is dedicated to high altitude plants - as such it is kept very cool. Which is reason enough to pay the entry fee given the usual temperatures in Singapore! The care and attention is great, the walkways very even in their upwards progression, the lifts efficient and the place has enough of a sense of space to help you relax. You'll never forget you are in a dome as it stares you in the face but even that adds to the wonder of how humans can create their own slice of reality. The plants are luscious and presented in great variety and there are some good photo opportunities.

Children of all ages should really enjoy this place especially when combined with the Flower Dome.

Energetic types may wish to walk farther on to Satay by the Bay for some cheap food and thence onto the Marina Barrage."
,,"Beautiful, nothing like it!",5.0,,"How often do you get to experience a waterfall indoors, and to walk between tree tops? This place offers exactly that. You get to see all those beautiful flowers that grow at different places and that look quite unusual, you get to be amazed from big chunks of amethyst and stalagmites/stalactites. Consider it a casual walk with beautiful views inside and outside the conservatory.
There are different sections to the exhibition both knowledge and awareness oriented and just to admire the beauty of nature."
,,wow,5.0,,visually stunning. definitely worth seeing.the canopy is a bit scary if you don't like heights but the view is spectacular. waterfalls & vertical gardens were wonderful.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Really one of the best botanical gardens you can go to. Its an artificially created environment inside plus its huge and a visual treat!
,,Refreshing and enjoyable!! A must see...,4.0,,"Similar to the gardens by the bay, go early and enjoy the place, stroll around at your own pace. And learn all about ecology and conservation. A must watch is the short film titled, ""5'degrees'"
,,absolutely amazing,5.0,,Not what i expected but definitely worth the visit after a walk in the park. Also visit the other dome too.
,,Prepare to get wet!,4.0,,This is part of Gardens by The Bay. Great fun if you go with a partner or group. There is a 35 metre man made waterfall which looks amazing and there is the Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk to experience.
,,Human made wonder,5.0,,Just amazing.. What we can do with our creativity and imagination is visible here? Great atmosphere outside clubbed up with controlled environment inside makes for a wonderful time
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"I am not a big gardener but this place is impressive. Not sure how they are able to do it. Allow plenty of time to walk around the inside, and outside, gardens. Wear warm clothes for inside part. Good value day out. Food and coffee is pretty bad though."
,,Nice,4.0,,Nice place to walk in and take the sceenery walk in the air where you can see the marina bay up close.
,,This is a must see,5.0,,"This Cloud Forest Dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex, which is terrific, but in my opinion this Dome is the best part. This is a must-see display."
,,Fabulous must see,5.0,,An indoor botanic garden with a 5 story waterfall. Really unique and quite breathtaking. The flowers are wonderful. This was our first day in Singapore and it's a must do for visitors who are only there for a short time.
,,"Unique, scenic, and moving",5.0,,This place is great. It would be great if one could avoid school groups and tourist groups who don't really appreciate the beauty of the place...
,,One of a kind,4.0,,This is something you don't see every day. An indoor tropical mountain. Worth a visit and the money spent. Don't come too late as it's best viewed at natural light.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Covered above - a must visit - buy tickets in advance or at the airport - they offer some discount on the package
,,Must see.,5.0,,Please see my previous review of this and the Flower Garden. A really attractive place set in beautiful gardens and disabled access to all areas.
,,Waterfall and a bit more..,4.0,,"It's worth to see once just to check it.As usual all creative mind of construction and fantasy singaporean engineers put into this place.It's a artificial green mountain with a big waterfall which has 7 levels inside:gardens,exhibitions of minerals etc."
,,Human made wonder,5.0,,Just amazing.. What we can do with our creativity and imagination is visible here? Great atmosphere outside clubbed up with controlled environment inside makes for a wonderful time

,,Interesting,3.0,,"It is more of a fun experience than a garden. There are two domes. In this one there is a big waterfall and you go to the top and start to walk down through bridges. At the bottom there is some educative videos. It is quite interesting how they educate you to try to save the planet and apparently they are banned from import more sand from some countries because of environmental reasons...Nothing special if you have visited the Eden Project in UK.
I think this one can be more fun with children than the flower dome."
,,Wonderful vertical garden,5.0,,"I would highly recommend this place for families with children. It's not only a lovely indoor airconditioned vertical garden with waterfalls, but it also serves as a great education on global warming. Don't miss it."
,,Amzing,5.0,,This is just an amazing exhibition of plants. You are greeted by a massive waterfall and it just gets better from that. It gives 'vertical gardens' a whole new meaning.
,,Glorious blend of engineering and natural beauty,5.0,,"The vast park at this end of Singapore is truly impressive. What foresight by Singaporeans and their local officials to have set aside this land. Something green and exotic will catch your eye at every turn. The structure is magnificent, the atmosphere cool and inviting, and the constant churning waterfall is so appealing."
,,A walk in the clouds,5.0,,"Amazing rainforest like gardens, stunning flowers & plants. Top of the waterfall felt like you were amongst the clouds."
,,Cloud Forest Dome,3.0,,"Pretty average attraction when compared to the Flower Dome. If you have time constraints, go to the Flower Dome instead of the Cloud Forest."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Indiana Jones meets rainforest. I was really impressed by the Cloud Forest. One of the best attractions in Singapore. Although the Flower Dome next door was quite nice as well...the Cloud Forest was surprisely interesting. I liked how they had an exhibit after a walk through the clouds and trees about global warming and deforestation. That made it more than just a regular conservatory but almost a quasi adventure exhibit. Best time to go is in the afternoon when it's super hot outside. You will be cooled down inside this place.
,,A must,5.0,,"Make sure you pre-book your tickets for this and the flower dome as it will mean you will have more time to take this all in.

This is an awesome experience and you would be a fool not to visit. There is a great mix of plants, sculptures, waterfalls and you'll be happy snapping away all day.

The whole place is really impressive."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Together with the Flower Dome, the joint entry is $28.00. There is a lift for those that can't manage the stairs etc but it was well worth a visit. Not just plants but sculptures and caves and streams etc."
,,It's the 'coolest' place in Singapore......,5.0,,"Located within the new Gardens by the Bay attraction. Well worth a visit. Avoid weekends or hoidays as its very new and quite rightly,most folks living in Singapore want to see it too!"
,,intriging,4.0,,"This Dome was worthwhile going inside to visit. We enjoyed the plants and enjoyed the concept that the dome was so big and entertaining. The gardens were maintained with minimal impact to the tourist, carefully weeding and trimming with only a small bucket for the excess plants. A very cool place to be on a very hot day!"
,,Otherworldly,5.0,,This is an amazing place to visit. Take the elevator to the top and walk down the spiral walkway. It is better to visit after dark.
,,Mystical place to enjoy and learn about the environment...,5.0,,"You may get a little damp, but it is worth the adventure. I hear that at night it is really cool with the lighting effects and mist."
,,Not to be missed.,5.0,,If you have the time after visiting the hotel 'skypark' then this has to be the next on the list ! It is amazing and worth the $28SD that you pay for the two domes. The 'clouds' are so real at the higher levels and the waterfall is seriously impressive.
,,out of this world,5.0,,"I loved it , the flowers and the wateralls, the stone works of art, simply spectacular views and east to walk around. lots of places for great photos. I loved the orchids and the little ponds and all the little statues scattered around. Well worth seeing"
,,Excellent,1.0,,"Loved it. A great experience, very unusual and the tree walk is excellent offering great views of the city."
,,Chuffin Ace!,5.0,,"Words can't encapsulate this superb place - the architecture, the flora - it's all just awesome. We did both domes (Flower and Cloud) and whilst both are ace, the latter is the most breathtaking. Highly recommended!"
,,"Nice try, will rate average to good",3.0,,"Artifical attraction, good attempt to make it worth. Will rate from Average to good, nothing much to see actually once you pass waterfall. Kids will still love it, good to frop by when you are visiting Gardens by the Bay"
,,Feels like fairyland,5.0,,"I love the waterfall feature, it's tall and looked very real! The plants and flowers are all of rare and exotic kind! Love the experience of walking in a 'real' forest!"
,,Cloud dome delight,5.0,,This whole area is a credit to Singapore and the Cloud Dome is no exception such a lot going on in a small place just like being in the rain forest waterfall and all.
,,Really bad...,3.0,,The first thought when you enter the dome is 'WOW'. But the moment you get past the initial waterfall that is when reality hits you in the face and one feels cheated for the SGD 16 one has to shell out for entering the Dome. There is absolutely nothing of substance beyond the ground level. An absolute waste of your precious dollars.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Absolute must to visit. Probably the best attraction in Singapore. Fantastic would not miss it. Visit in late afternoon and stay for evening light show
,,Awesome sight,5.0,,"Wow, what a great thing to see. I could have spent more time there as it is such an inspiring place to visit. Singapore rocks!"
,,serene and beautiful!,4.0,,its absolutely beautiful..man made.yet looks completely natural!walking in the heat outside..when you enter here...its feels very cool and pleasant!
,,amazing waterfall,3.0,,amazing waterfall but i prefer the original one in my home country hehehe.. tired to walk around but it is cool not too hot in the dome compare to outside garden area
,,Something different,5.0,,"This is a tall dome in the Gardens by the Bay, it has a waterfall that you walk behind and and sky walks. A bit worthy in places but still fun. You should get a discount is you show your SA boarding pass."
,,Beautiful flora,4.0,,The dome is well worth a visit but it was a little over priced and not recommended for people who suffer from vertigo.
,,Very good value,4.0,,Visited the cloud Forrest dome and was surprised how much we enjoyed it - very cool atmosphere inside with fascinating plants from all around the world - well worth the entrance fee.
,,"Worth a visit, but leave time for the gardens next door",4.0,,"We liked the display and the very tall waterfall. Youngsters will be especially impressed. We had first visited the gardens of wonder next door, and for those interested in exotic plants, that one is better."
,,Worth every cent!,5.0,,"Singapore never fails to amaze me with their feats of engineering and the Cloud Forest dome is one of my favourites.

It's lovely and cool inside as you enter to see an indoor waterfall. You then wander to a lift to the top floor and meander down the multiple levels of the forest before reaching the lowest level again.

We were here for at least 90 minutes and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you fly Singapore airlines bring your boarding pass for ten percent discount. Do consider a light cardigan as it's cool, but also a welcome relief in Singapore!

Ladies, bring wet wipes to wipe the toilets as they are not always pristine..."
,,So enjoyable,5.0,,"This is such a brilliant concept, it is difficult to describe in every day language. Make sure you try every one of the seven floors"
,,Must visit,4.0,,One of the best places to visit while in Singapore. Amazing and beautiful. The entrance is the highlight!!!
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This place is cold so I recommend bringing a jacket along. The place is full of amazing and beautiful plants and the occasional butterfly which is great and a wonderful place to spend a too-hot day in Singapore.
,,Perfectly done,5.0,,"Do the tram. The cloud forest is the better! but the tropical garden is great! too. I'm supposed to write more, so it's a tad pricy, but very comfortable in the heat."
,,really great experience,5.0,,Its architecture and the theme is beyond imagination.We all really had great time there.Water falls and flowers add to the joy of enjoying artificially created mist and clouds.The huge bridge to go around is amazing.
,,A different way to view plants.,4.0,,"I find plants and flowers a bit boring, but this was so different I really enjoyed it. The many different levels and the view outside, wonderful."
,,Don't miss - Garden's By The bay,5.0,,Part of the Garden's on the Bay this dome will blow your mind. It has a 35 meter man made mountain and waterfall inside. Combine with Flower Dome and the Super Trees and there is an afternoon of entertainment here. Worth the money to have a look.
,,Very Impressive,5.0,,Very impressive conservatory with 25 meter indoor waterfall and platforms that overlook the beautiful area.
,,Very pretty gardens,4.0,,"Very pretty gardens, and a giant waterfall. Bit pricey though for what it is. Be warned, have your camera lens cap on when you walk in or you will get water all over the lens"
,,Excellent if you like gardening well worth a look,5.0,,What an excellent piece of work. well thought out and maintained. It was cooler in the gardens than outside:)
,,Nice Forest,3.0,,"I thought the price was just a little expensive given the fact there are several things all together and you must pay seperate entry fees for, but once inside it is quite pretty and the forest feel is there. Some beautiful flora and trees around, and it's good to go from one level to the next until you get to the top to see what grows well at different heights. It's a little bit muggy in some parts just like a tropical rainforest, but it is one of the must see locations when visiting Singapore."
,,"Part of ""gardens by the Bay""",5.0,,"From the bottom of the rain forest to the top, the best rain forest exhibit we have seen. Connected to Flower Dome and together they make Gardens by the Bay amazing."
,,definitely worth the entrance fee,5.0,,"the waterfall ... the cloud walk ... the flowers ... the vast array of plants ... words cannot do the work to put this together justice. You will just have to come and see for yourself, you wont be sorry (unless you get vertigo, in that case, try the Flower Dome)"
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Superb architecture, engineering and plant growing experience with terrific waterfalls. An attraction for all ages."
,,Nice floral and fauna........,4.0,,"I love the variety of plants and flowers, specially the orchids.... they're just so beautiful........ even the moss plants on the vintage cars, oh, i couldn't imagine how they were able to show it so attractive...... i didn't quite like the falls, though, because of the tubings and the very obvious waterway...... it really looked like a false falls......"
,,Must do,5.0,,Cant believe we did not do this on our first trip to Singapore as it is so totally worth it. Dont miss it for sure!
,,a wow place,4.0,,you are greeted and amazed by a huge man made waterfall.. a very nice place to visit. its quite crowded though.. and make sure you have ordered a ticket before your visit as the queues are very long!!
,,Stunning place to visit,5.0,,The vertical gardens will take you breath away...be sure to really look at just how much plant material is on the vertical garden.
,,Stunning,5.0,,What an interesting man made structure. It was so beautiful with the waterfall and all the plants. Worth seeing.
,,Fun place for a weekend activity,5.0,,Went here with my hubby and a friend. The views were absolutely amazing. This place is a must see if you are in Singapore. K
,,A cool forest dome,5.0,,"Cloud forest is a facility that is unique to Singapore. They have made a virtual forest out of man-made things. When you enter the area, you will be enthralled by the the waterfall, a breath taking view from the bottom. The whole forest is in shape of a hill. You have to climb (walk/escalator) up to reach new places and view new scenes that this place has to offer. The best thing about the place is that the climate inside is cool and pleasant."
,,Wow!,5.0,,I did not expect something like that! we see flowering plants that we will normally see at high altitude. beautifully done. Cannot wait to bring my parents to see it!!!
,,Avatar,5.0,,"Throughout our tour in Cloud Forest, I had the feeling that it was straight out from the movie Avatar. This structure is huge and beautiful."
,,Wow!,5.0,,As you enter the dome! Cold and wet and a real huge waterfall against the entrance! It`s breathtaking
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,It's inside Gardens By The Bay. Buy a package of two tickets to save your money. Be careful when entrancing because of the water fall.
,,Amazing place don't miss it,5.0,,"This is a great combination of nature, design and technology. It combines a large waterfall, a 'mountain' which is also a route up down and around the forest, and an exhibition. A fascinating place for both kids and grown-ups."
,,A cloud not to be missed.,5.0,,"I had heard quite a lot about this dome but it was even more magical when one entered it. Great experience and the children were especially delighted with the ""big"" waterfall. Marvellous views of Singapore from the top .We never thought so many plants could be put in such a space. The old trtuck display was outstanding."
,,Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls...,5.0,,...But you have to see this one. A lovely sight to see in hot Singapore and the re-creation of a rainforest cluster within a giant glass dome is simply impressive to say the very least. Worth a visit.
,,wonderfull,5.0,,"A wonderfull place. The dom is amazing, walking around on the high bridges is very impressive. If you want to visit only one dom - choose this one."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This is very well constructed. the array of plants, ponds, waterfalls, sculptures etc is just lovely."
,,Excellent excellent excellent tourist attraction,5.0,,There is nothing to dislike about this dome....amazing attraction. Singapore has much to be proud of as world class tourist destination.
,,Nice waterfall and overall stunning place,5.0,,"Situated in Gardens by the Bay area and right next to Flower Dome, so remember to buy tickets for both of those. Once you get in, you see lovely waterfall and when you take lift upstairs, you walk back down and enjoy beautiful views, flowers and plants etc.(check my pics)"
,,Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,The water fall is the center piece to this. You go up level by level. This was very relaxing and fun at the same time.
,,lots of mist on the day we visited,5.0,,"We enjoyed walking through the mist in the conservatory. It was very wet, but fun. We had gone in the summer, but it seemed to be wetter this time, but not so wet that your clothes were damp after the visit."
,,Nice but not important,3.0,,"As a visitor, I did not find it that much appealing, except the waterfall. There is a vast area which most probably horticulturist will be liking very much."
,,Worth paying for once,4.0,,Interesting place to visit once a bit pricey but very well done. Traffic flow inside works well. Typical Singapore every little detail is considered
,,Beautiful Spectacle for the Eyes!,5.0,,We really loved the variety of the plants and the waterfall. It was a real treat to get out of the heat and enjoy a rain forest in the middle of downtown Singapore! A leisurely stroll through amazing beauty!
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This is a lovely Dome with flowers and waterfalls. Flowers from all over the world. A must for all visitors to Singapore.
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,Really loved this attraction. . It is so cleverly done. The eye is drawn upwards as soon as you walk in. The planting is brilliant. . This was one of my favourite spots. Does frizz the hair though!!
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I have to say I find it odd the reviews that have criticised this for being fake. Of course it's fake, but it is supposed to be an accessible version of something that otherwise a lot of us would never get to see, no different than a zoo or museum exhibit.

I found it beautiful and enjoyable. I was surprised how many people didn't take the opportunity to go out and walk on the exposed catwalks, I found that really enjoyable. We took the time to stop and read the information boards so we understood what we were looking at and what they were trying to show us.

An added bonus, being indoors and climate controlled we weren't constantly getting bitten by bugs! Sure, takes away from the ""realism"" but meant I took the time to appreciate the vegetation a lot more than I otherwise would."
,,Impressive piece of work,5.0,,"The dome gives a good impression of the vegetation on a mountain slope. A walkpath around and through the mountain shows various flowers and plants. On the top a cloud is simulated. All this is completed with a waterfall.
Although not described on their website, you can buy a ticket for 1 dome as a foreigner (16 SGD)."
,,Hmmm.,1.0,,"As I write this, the most recent review is entitled: “A View of the Rainforest in the middle of a cosmopolitan city!”

That may be 100% true. But Singapore's approach to this is world-class off-the-rails terrible.

When did I first experience this concept? Was it at Kew Gardens almost 50 years ago? And Kew Gardens' Palm House dates from the 1840s. *That* facility is world-class excellent.

Of course, Singapore should not need to create a tropical rainforest in a conservatory - as that's the ambient climate of this locale (if a forest can be maintained). The Botanic Gardens has a small segment of rainforest ""au naturale"" within its property. Small slivers of mangrove exist in more than one park location in the city-state. The Cloud Forest Dome attempts to recreate a cooler forest than could be maintained au naturale in Singapore. However, making this a commercial enterprise in the Gardens by the Bay complex, rather than locating it at the Botanic Gardens or in one of Singapore's Parks and making it financially sustainable but not so *uber commercial*, highlights the commercial (rather than any other possible) aspect of this facility. That is a sad thing to do, and germinated all sorts of rumours about a possible commercialisation of the Botanic Gardens. Hopefully, the Gardens by the Bay will evolve for the better, rather than the Botanic Gardens evolving for the worse."
,,Must Do,5.0,,"A Tropical Forest ambience with a Waterwall, bang in the middle of Singapore. The Dome has about 5 levels. At each level there is great educational information about how clouds are formed and how rainfall occurs in the Tropical climate."
,,"Buy the tickets to watch artificial waterfall, pieces of stalactites and stalagmites",2.0,,"When we entered this dome, we saw a 7 storeys artificial waterfall. Then we took the lift up to 7th floor. There were some attractions inside the dome.
Then we went down by elevator level by level. On the 4 or 5th level (if I'm not mistaken), we saw some pieces of stalactites and stalagmites. I thought that those pieces of stalactites and stalagmites had been taken from anywhere abroad. To be honest, we were concerned about this one.
Sure, we won't come back."
,,A View of the Rainforest in the middle of a cosmopolitan city!,4.0,,Well designed to give the atmosphere of a rainforest and dotted with information that gives the visit food for thought about how humans are changing the biodiversity of this wonderful world that we live in. It does have an artificial feel but the waterfall with its spray chilling you on a hot day is lovely. We left the place with a sense of appreciation for biodiversity and the cleverness of those who designed this lovely green space inside one of the busy metropolises of Asia.
,,Excellent concept and very educational,5.0,,Excellent - where else could you find a towering waterfall and misty and cloudy forest in a dome in the heart of Singapore? Thoroughly enjoyed our time here!
,,Amazing Cliud Forest,5.0,,Located in the Gardens By the Bay area this would probably be the only indoor cloud forest and its to be seen to be believed.
,,"Beautiful, part of the Gardens by the bay experience",5.0,,"Great experience, cloud dome is a part of the Gardens by the bay, which is located just behind the Marina by the Sands.. Altogether with flower dome..it creates a great natural experience. You can spot all the biotops and climb into the heigh of a rain forest and observe the beauty of the nature."
,,Experience a forest inside a dome!,4.0,,"Very neatly created and maintained, it is a nice walk down a rainforest (includes a full-size man-made waterfall!) with a wide variety of flora. Good educational tour for kids."
,,Beyond Your Imagination!,5.0,,"Very beyond expectations that could find a place as green and this cold in the middle of Singapore. Artificial forest, but very nice and beautiful. The new tourist attractions in Singapore. There are some areas paid, while the surrounding gardens is free (of course well-maintained and clean)."
,,Fantastic`,5.0,,Paid the extra money to visit the two domes at Gardens by the Bay and this dome was excellent as was the Flower Dome too. The gardens are highly recommended.
,,"Stunning, beautiful, integral part of GBTB",5.0,,"This is one of the two domes in Gardens by the Bay - the version with the waterfall at the entrance. Firstly, it's a cool relief from the scorching Singapore heat that engulfs you walking outside among the gardens. In Cloud Forrest, you first see a beautiful water fall which forces you to look upward to get a sneak peak of the dome's contents. you then basically walk around the waterfall, enjoying along the way various plants and exhibits. For some reason, there's a train display at the second level, but if you have kids, it's perfectly timed because they may get a bit bored at this stage. then you eventually reach the top amidst a foggy style trek along the rafters. Like everything at Gardens, first class. there are a couple displays in here about sediments or something like that - ok, I guess we need a little education but no one seemed to care about that. this is truly a wonder, inside and out. Highly recommended."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Cool - both the atmosphere and the idea of this place! The structure of the dome itself is beautiful, but the misty, flower covered Forest inside is something out of this world. You go up in a lift and then wander down around the mini mountain getting views of all the different plants and the waterfalls. Was relaxing, beautiful and inspiring. If we lived in Singapore we would want to come here every week!"
,,surprisingly good,5.0,,"I was not sure what to expect from this attraction. It seemed like we would just walk around, look at some plants and then leave. But I was surprised how interesting they managed to make it. There is an entire walking circuit, starting from the top floor of the dome down to the basement. They have put a lot of work into making this an interesting experience --landscaping the different areas and designing the path so that you get different views sometimes from within the tower, sometimes from a catwalk with views down at the floor of the dome, beside the waterfall, etc. It was a great way to spend an afternoon."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"The variety of greenery and the secrets of Mother Nature at her best. The more you explore inside the dome, the more you recover in plant species and more. A must visit!"
,,Plant life at altitude,5.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay experience - a separate dome/building - extra entrance fee required. But it is worth it because once inside, the clever architectural layout means you get to experience the life of plants that grow at altitude. On entering you see (and get a little wet from) the highest indoor waterfall in the world. Then take the lift up to the top floor and meander down the walkways through many layers of a very different plant world. For those with vertigo take the lift down floor by floor rather than walk on the walkways."
,,Like nothing I have ever seen,5.0,,"Wow , as soon as you walk in, you are greeted by the most spectacular waterfall. It was cool inside the dome, a welcome relief from the heat and humidity outside.What a fabulous attraction, we learned many things and got some great ideas for our own garden at home. We spent a few hours in the dome wandering through all the different levels, from the walk through the canopy to the secret garden near end or the trail. Gorgeous water feature areas and lush tropical gardens.Even the 15 year old son was captivated not bored ! Would go again."
,,Nice gem.,4.0,,Nvr expected it to be so educational. Really nicely planned and maintained. Didnt expect to see such forest trees being planted for educational purposes. Great job to the creator and the team!!
,,Facinating visit,5.0,,It's worth paying extra to visit the Domes- bit like Eden Project- but on a tropical grander scale. A huge vertical structure within the dome has access by walkways and platforms to show a vast array of flora and fauna. Bit of an architectural masterpiece.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Singapore proves with Gardens by the Bay that they are really out there on the edge in design and engineering. The Cloud Forest Dome is simply spectacular. Go to the park in the late afternoon and stay until dark. You will not be disappointed.
,,Interesting way to spend an hour,4.0,,As soon as you enter this man made dome you are first struck by the cool temperature (even a little chilly) then second by the waterfall in front of you. A man made mountain covered in flora and fauna skirted by walkways at different heights. Be warned that this may not be suitable for people who don't like heights. A great way to spend an hour with nature in the middle of the skyscrapers
,,Closest thing to being in the Amazon!,4.0,,"Cloud Forest was an educational experience. We loved seeing the different plant life that you would find if you were in the jungles of the Amazon. The bridge walk was great too, although, if you don't do heights well, maybe don't walk on there."
,,Loved the dome!,5.0,,This was my favourite of the Gardens of the Bay complex. I loved the falls and the plants. Great experience walking all the way down from the top to the bottom.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Walking around here was great, I loved it all. The waterfalls, the steam for the clouds and the plants. It was good to see so many from our own garden doing so well here, especially the fuchsias."
,,Interesting and visually stimulating,4.0,,Killed and hour here and I thought it was time well spent. Plant and arbor species from all over the planet.
,,Loved this a lot!!,5.0,,"Caution: for people who have height sickness might not like this.
I loved everything in there. The waterfall is really pretty and cool, walking around the walkway at the top, is really great. It's very high but the feel of the clouds are great. It's very chilly inside. I didn't took out my phone at all during the whole explore around this building. It's a bit wet but great experience."
,,"Please go during the day, not night.",5.0,,"Stayed here for the afternoon and went back after dinner. You will enjoy it a lot better at day time, although the lights lit around the bridge are spectacular."
,,Awsome!,5.0,,One cant express about the cloud forest dome in mere words. One has to actually visit the place to understand and enjoy this amazing architectural wonder. Its just amazing.. Great place to visit with kids. Highly recommended.
,,Great relief from the heat....great attraction!!,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest Dome within Gardens By The Bay are a wonderful indoor (and air conditioned) exhibit of a rain forest similar to those in Central Africa. At times I half expexted a gorilla to jump out of the foliage such was the reality of this place. Loved the big waterfalls, the mist and clouds that surrounded this indoor mountain. Well worth a visit!!"
,,Better during day time,4.0,,"Better to see during day time so you get all the different colours, rather than the green artificial lighting provided at night."
,,Another Great Attraction,5.0,,"It is part of Gardens by the Bay.
Excellent man made mountain covered in plants.
Impressive cascading waterfall.
Lovely and cool inside the dome away from the Singapore heat.
Take your camera and comfortable walking shoes.
Your SQxxx boarding pass is worth a discount on the entry fee."
,,What an experience,5.0,,Wow is all I can say. This is a great experince. words cannot describe what is there. 2-3 hrs will fly by. Spend time on top of the cloud if you are not afraid of heights.
,,Cloudy and rainy!,4.0,,"Loved this experience of a cloud forest in the heart of urban Singapore. I love the outdoors and it's inspiring me to travel to a real cloud forest in Borneo! Highly recommended to come here, best the heat, and immerse yourself in waterfalls and nature!"
,,brilliant experience attached to MBS hotel,5.0,,"This is truly a great thing to do for people of all ages while in Singapore. The architecture of the building structures is incredible, and its no surprise that the buildings won an architectural award for best building in 2012. Well deserved. There are 2 covered areas, and i prefered the cloud forest dome: more interesting and dramatic."
,,A must,5.0,,We done this on the last day when we had a few hours before our flight and glad we didn't miss it as it was beautiful inside. The largest indoor waterfall in asia with a big mountain like structure with plants and flowers all over.
,,A great experience,4.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Cloud Dome. There is so much to see, some of which is amazing when you consider the whole place is man-made."
,,Love the waterfall,5.0,,"The cascading man-made waterfall is a delight to all as milling viewers feast on its magnificence. The place is cooling, which is a great retreat from the sweltering heat in Singapore. The place is beautiful as well! Just follow the route and finish it up!"
,,Like going to an adult Disneyland,5.0,,"The whole of Gardens on the Bay are absolutely amazing, the walk thru the waterfall area was very beautiful, well worth half a day. Tranquil and a nice change from shopping!"
,,Unbelievable,4.0,,"Blew my mind when I first came in. It is a man made marvel. Attractions / exhibits inside are generally enough, but the view is breathtaking."
,,Incredible First Impression and then Ho Hum,3.0,,"The Cloud Forest is one of two indoor domes at the Gardens by the Bay. The dome contains an impressive looking tower that is covered with plants. There are also walkways that jut out from the tower. Once over the awe of the tower, the dome is not all that interesting. There are a few interesting plants and natural crystal formations. The dome does provide real escape from the heat of the city."
,,Christmas break,5.0,,Real wow factor with this one. Well worth a visit. Architecturally is very impressive. Easy to access via the various public transport systems.
,,Breathtaking.....,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay and probably, in my opinion, one of the most impressive attractions in Singapore. Entrance to both the Cloud forest dome and the flower dome is SGD 28 ( I don't think it's possible to buy a ticket for one dome unless you're a local resident). Complete with a 35 metre high man made mountain and waterfall, this dome is an absolute must if you visit Gardens by the Bay. The variety of plants including many orchids,ferns and pitcher plants is very impressive and the dome does seem to be able to cope with a high number of visitors without appearing overcrowded. Make sure that your camera battery is fully charged because it will be difficult to stop taking photographs!
Combined with the Flower dome and the rest of Gardens by the Bay, you could easily spend a whole day here. We can't wait to visit again. Worth noting that tickets can be bought online thus saving having to queue."
,,Man made marvel,3.0,,"It feels good inside. The sudden cool climate is a fresh change. Apart from that, there is nothing great for the price of the ticket!"
,,Loved this place,5.0,,Loved the Cloud forest dome. The waterfall is beautiful and walking the ramp back down the mountain provides an excellent view.
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,"I loved this. It's annoying that you can't buy individual tickets as the flower dome wasn't that great (in my opinion) but the cloud dome made up for it. It's really quite cold in there though so maybe take an extra layer, but it is such an original concept and you do feel like you're up a mountain when you're at the top!"
,,impressive,5.0,,"Impressive !! This artificial mountain is really impressive. The temperature, plant and other factors varies depending on the altitude this is a must do in Singapore!"
,,Amazing attraction,5.0,,"Air conditioned, along with the adjacent Flower Dome. Giant refreshing cool waterfall. Walk high up in a man-made ""forest"". Great during mid-day heat or rainy day. Must-see if you love plants."
,,Wow...,5.0,,"This was worth the entry fee , the plants ,trees and flowers in the cloud forest were really wonderful. Singapore really know how to do man made look alike natural landscapes so well. The seafood restaurant here was great too !!"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,You must go to this amazing garden and domes. Fascinating plants from around the world and Eco systems in the domes including a cloud/ waterfall system.
,,Excellent vision and concept of vertical plantation,4.0,,"This is just amazing! To be able to come up with such artistic vision to create a vertical plantation and have a created effect of walking around walkway that seems to be floating in the clouds is just great. This is almost a perfect rating for me but I just got bored on the way out... but that is just me... If you like nature and art, you have to visit this one!"
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,"We went to both of the domes. Unfortunately we went to the Cloud Forest first and ended with the Flower dome which is far less interesting comparatively with the Cloud Forest Dome which is amazingly beautiful and well laid out. I enjoyed all the information about the different plants/flowers/altitudes for the 'cloud forest' aspect. Added a bit of interesting educational stuff to the experience. The other things, including the ""+5 degrees"" video was also great!"
,,"Fantastic, loved it!",5.0,,The whole Gardens by the Bay are amazing but this conservatory is really something else....as close as it gets to being up a mountain in a rainforest type environment and a really unusual idea for a glasshouse. Loved it.
,,Now You Can Visit the Rainforest in SIngapore,5.0,,This place is amazing with lots of interesting plants even a waterfall. You need to take your time exploring this dome. There are also loads of informative information boards to help us learn about the importance of rainforests.
,,Excellent and beautifully built,5.0,,"My favourite dome in Gardens by the Bay. I love the huge waterfall and the walk around the ""hill"", everything is so beautifully done. I would appreciate if more flowers had their names next to them."
,,Interesting and beautiful,5.0,,"I didn't realize what a cloud forest was until I entered the space to find a huge waterfall and indoor rainforest. There are lots of elements to this space, and you can wind in and out of the center ""mountain"" making for some great views and photos. There's a conservation education piece attached to the attraction which is quite interesting as well. Easily spent 1-2 hours here."
,,Fantastic: technology & nature,5.0,,"I love this place, as in all the gardens by the bay, technology produces an artificial nature or a natural artifice which captures the attention. Many beautiful pictures, colored flowers in several settings and a very interesting final room with the projection of the self sustainability concepts applied in the gardens, energy saving, recycling, water reuse, ... I think that after watching this presentation everybody can better appreciate the whole gardens by the bay."
,,Fantastic thoroughly recommend,5.0,,"This is an absolute must see in Singapore. The dome is constructed out of steel and metal and it's worth seeing purely for the architecture. The waterfall, walk ways in the clouds and plants are wonderful. The video presentation +5 degrees really struck a cord with me."
,,"Beautiful, refreshing and educational all at once",5.0,,I wanted to linger on every floor but we came late in the afternoon and it was getting dark. Make sure you have time for the short film and the exhibit on the Garden's sustainable energy system near the end.
,,Beautiful glass dome conservatory,5.0,,"Cloud Forest Dome is located within Gardens by the Bay, which is a garden on reclaimed land just off Marina Sands covering over 100 Hectares.
The Dome itself is 58 meters high and made of a metal frame with 2577 glass panels. Inside the Dome is moist and cooled to replicate a tropical mountain atmosphere between 1000 to 3000 meters above sea level. Within the dome is a man made mountain like structure about 35 meters tall covered in plants. On one side is a waterfall cascading from the top.
You enter the dome in front of the waterfall, walk around to the other side of the Cloud Mountain and take a lift to the 6th floor. A flight of stairs takes you to the top, known as The Lost World. You then descend along the stairway to the Cloud Walk, a walkway around the upper part of the mountain, then down to the Cavern and Crystal Mountain (with stalactites and stalagmites from caves in China). You then go to the Treetop Walk, a walkway around the lower part and down to the Secret Garden home to plants from the ravines of New Zealand.
Before you exit the dome there are two small auditoriums showing videos about global warming etc.
The Cloud Mountain has 6000 square meters of planted space.
There is one more such conservatory next to it called the Flower Dome. They also have restaurants and a gift shop within the garden complex,
Getting there is reasonably convenient. They have an MRT station called Bayfront Station just outside the garden. There is also a taxi stand within. Timings are from 9 am to 9 pm. I got there by 9.15 in the morning and I'm glad I went early because as I was leaving the place bus loads of tourists were arriving."
,,"I prefer this Dome, of the two.",5.0,,"What more can you ask for than a 3 storey waterfall?

What a magnificent sight! Kids will not only enjoy the wonder of seeing a man-made waterfall, but imagine all the great photo-ops available at this place which mixes the beautiful colours of flowers & blends it well with the other elements."
,,totally random,5.0,,"omg I love this place, it is amaze balls. it's so beautiful and even educational. it's a well rounded attraction and if you are lucky like me you might even have some Chinese students approach you to ask if you can be in a photo with them. totally random!!!

it's also very cool inside. allow 2 hrs for the visit here"
,,A cool moist walk describing the nine unique forest zones on Earth,5.0,,"The Cloud Forest is a part of Gardens by the Bay. Artificial clouds are created by mist all across the dome. The concept is entirely different from the Flower Dome. A 35-metre tall mountain covered in lush vegetation shrouding the world’s tallest indoor waterfall showcases plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000-metres above sea level.

Walk up to the highest point of the mountain, called The Lost World, which replicates the cloud forest vegetation at around 2,000m above sea level. This is where you can also enjoy fantastic views of the Marina Bay waterfront. Look out for carnivorous plants such as pitcher plants and the Venus Fly-catcher, against a carpet of delicate ferns and moss. On the way down via Cloud Walk see different plants on the walls. Have good view of Water Falls. Further down there are crystal rocks of different shapes and sizes found on Earth. At ‘+5 Degree’ you will virtually experience the effect of temperature increase around the planet. It is very nice walk describing the nine unique forest zones on Earth in this cool-moist Conservatory."
,,Magnificent rain forest recreation- part of the Gardens by the Bay experience,5.0,,"This is one of the two indoor gardens at Gardens by the Bay- the other is the Flower Done.

When you visit the Gardens by the Bay, entry is free to the outdoor gardens, but you have to pay to go into either or both of the indoor gardens ( you can buy tickets for entry to either or both).

What you do is a matter of time and interest.

The entry price is reasonable value.

The Cloud Forest Dome is a large artificial rain forest. You go up 7 storeys, then walk down to ground level, experiencing aspects of the rain forest as you go. If you're interested in this kind of thing, it's a magnificent spectacle.

On the other hand, I suspect the adjacent Flower Dome would have broader appeal if you're short of time.

And remember: the main Botanical Garden is excellent, and offers free entry (it's accessible by MRT and has its own MRT station).

Nonetheless, this is another high quality Singapore attraction, and in particular another drawcards for the recently developed Marina Bay Area."
,,A cool-moist experience,5.0,,"In hot Singapore, it is good to enjoy this cool and moist environment in the Gardens By The Bay. Open to the public from 9am to 9pm on every Wednesday to Sunday at S$20 (local residents) or S$28 (tourists), which includes the ticket to the Flower Dome attraction next door. Tourists are expected to buy the S$28 package, The park management did not advertise the price for separate entry tickets (without entry to the Flower Dome).
This Cloud forest attraction comprise 10 highlights which include:
1) The fall - Just after the entrance you are greeted by a high man-made waterfall of 58m. Because the water is so strong, it gets all over the place, beware of getting drenched here, take quick pictures and move on.
2) Lost World - when you move up the pathway at the fall, all the way to the end, you will see 6 lifts to bring you up to level 7 - the Lost World. This place is the highest point at the attraction. You will see plants that are 2,000 metres above sea level such as pitcher plants and Venus-fly catcher, ferns and moss.
3) Cloud Walk - You don't take the lift back down - you walk this cloud walk for a closed-up view of the of epiphytes plant species that clad the side of the structure.
4) The Cavern - below the Lost World is The Cavern, same type of plants here as you would see from the Cloud Walk.
5) Waterfall View - One level down through the escalators is the Waterfall View - enjoy the view of Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Skyline from here. Plants here are very similar to that at the Cavern.
6) Crystal Mountain - One level down through the escalators is the Crystal Mountain - Mountain Cave structures of real stalactites and stalagmites on display here. Displays showing they are formed are plentiful.
7) Treetop Walk - See more of tropical rainforest shrubs and flowers here.
8) Earth Check - At the end of Treetop Walk is a small museum named the Earth Check - see how human activities are destroying the earth, an education programme for everyone - to reflect on our attitudes towards the earth, use less electricity, recycle and reuse our goods.
9) +5 Degrees - Down a level is +5 Degrees, a small hall showing a video of how +5 degrees can impact the earth and our lives. Similar theme as the Earth Check. See a Model display of the Gardens By The Bay here.
10) Secret Garden - Also a 'Misty' Garden, you’ll see ferns, begonias, peperomias, pileas, fittonia and other moisture-loving plants covering the ground with their fascinating foliage."
,,Cool,4.0,,"We brought along our three school going children on a hot day. This place is just perfect. It's cooling, colorful, fresh oxygen from the plants, splashes from the 'waterfall'. Admit that all these are artificial, yet, where else can you explore a rainforest, with such altitude without fuss.
We spent almost 2 hours in there and get to learn something.
I don't mind going again."
,,An artificial repro of 'Cloud forest ',3.0,,"Not expensive by Singapore standards but I guess it is for fellow tourist from asia. Hence is not worth the price if u really want to enjoy nature! You shd go for the Botanic Gardens instead which is much more natural. If you are tight for time and not able to spare 2-3 hours walking down the bridges avoid this place. Im a Singaporean and does not think highly of this highly man made 'garden ' and oh, very surprised by the above average reviews here!!"
,,Indoor Hilltop,5.0,,"Great indoor hilltop. Start with the highest level by using lift and then walk down slowly to the ground. The giant waterfall in front can make you get wet. Tons of humid, not good for those who are not healthy or who got some cold. And beware to slip due to the wet floor."
,,Dome waterfall,4.0,,"Located in the Gardens by the Bay, for me this is the better of the two domes, starting at the top and working your way down it is a very well thought out and well worth a visit."
,,Experience waterfall,5.0,,"At opening of doors, see and experience the man-made waterfall. Man-made but still awesome. Then go from top level down and walk through the canopy, like a bird. Very enjoyable views."
,,Man Made Water Fall,3.0,,"Its a man made water fall with controlled chilling temperature inside. A nice place to visit on a sunny day :). Kids will love this place for sure. If you have ever seen a Natural waterfalls, this will be a different experience."
,,Needs work,3.0,,"Good idea and a refreshingly chilly dome but there's more concrete than plants. Not well organised or signposted, construction is continuing and they keep talking about all the animals that live in high altitude forests - none of which are there of course. Still, it's the same ticket as for the Flower Dome, which is better, so you may as well go."
,,Amazing... a must do with kids...,5.0,,"This experience was incredible with our 7&8 year old kids... they loved it... playing in the clouds, searching for flowers, learning about the environment and water. Many thought provoking moments for them... and very pretty too."
,,Not sure it's worth it for the price you pay...,3.0,,"Don't think it's value for money. If you are a resident it' a little bit cheaper but and the end of the day its a tower with a man made waterfall with different plants surrounding it. Nothing really amazing. The walkpath going from upstairs to downstairs has a nice view of the bay but its not really comfortable when you visit it with a baby and a pram as rather than having a path surrounding the tower has escalators so you have to get in and out of the lifts.

Sound on the room showing the gardens by the bay project video is terrible and not very loud, so you cannot hear it when other people is in the room talking. The sound on the downstairs video, talking about he temperature changing problem was better but there are only a few seats so you will probably have to stand up or sit on the floor if you want to watch the video.

Missed some guides maybe talking about the plants or a little bit more information showing around. Also at the mineral site, you don't really know what are you seeing??? No signs around the purple stones"
,,Must see,5.0,,We loved walking along the walkways there - must do after the flower dome. It is an artificial garden in the air conditioned dome with its own atmosphere. Kids were playing in the clouds at the top of the dome.
,,Simply breathtaking,5.0,,"I kind of already had commented on the cloud forest while commenting the the whole gardens by the bay.
I think a separate review is required here, as the cloud forest dome is simply breathtaking.

I have no clue how they managed to recreate this forest and amazing installation in there. Imagine a mix between a tropical cloud forest, having the impression to come back in time when no Man was there. You go up by the elevators to start on the top of the forest, you have a forest walk that slowly takes you down through the layers of the forest, and you end up downstairs at the feet of the waterfall.

You won't regret visiting this :-) One of my top visit during my holidays here for sure!"
,,Cool and Cloudy !!,5.0,,"Its a different experience all together once you step into this place ! Beautiful place - pleasant and amazing. On one side it makes a great attraction - on the other - it is an education for all of us to protect our nature.The waterfall, the trees and plants, the cloud walk, the crystal zone - all were just amazing. Makes you feel that you are really standing in the cloud forests. Frankly - I did not know anything about what cloud forests are till i stepped into this place. A Must visit place. Highly recommended.If you are local singaporean including people on EP,DP can purchase local resident tickets. For one conservatory the ticket cost is $12 , for both ( cloud and flower) it is $20.
Worth every penny !!"
,,It was a truly an experience,5.0,,"There are 2 domes flower dome and cloud forest dome. We bought tickets for both the domes.
It was interesting to watch flora and fauna at flower dome. But after visiting we felt we could skip flower dome and can opt only for cloud forest dome.

Its a misty forest experience. You will see lot of flora and fauna here with misty effect, as soon as you enter you will experience the waterfall and chilly breeze on your face. Then when you move around the dome, you will truly love the experience.

If you have less time or you want to save some money you surely can skip flower and go for cloud forest dome."
,,Splendid and mesmerizing!,5.0,,"Very beautiful, the atmosphere, the variety of the plants, the grand waterfall, the orchids, the stalactite, everything! Worth every penny. Don't miss it when you are in Singapore."
,,Surprising,5.0,,Just amazing and a must do while in Singapore Gardens and waterfall take your breath away and the climb and cloud and balloons are awesome. This is just another place in Singapore that is done so well
,,Unique experience,4.0,,The cloud dome's main attractions comprise a man-made waterfall and a 7-storey high walk among exotic plants which include a variety of pitcher plants. Certain parts of the walk require care especially when the floor is wet and also may not be conducive for parents with baby strollers. Can be a challenge to take photographs when there are many people along the path of the walk way.
,,Unique...and worth seeing....,4.0,,"The Cloud Forest is the second of the two domes in Singapore's 'Gardens by the Bay'. In my opinion, it is the better of the two so I would recommend doing it after you do the 'Flower Dome'. Basically, it is an example of a misty mountain....like what I think you would expect if you were in Uganda. You take the elevator up to the top and walk down. There is a huge waterfall. Very nice views. The closest MRT is the 'Bayfront' station. Well worth it as it's very unique. The is a great 5 (or so) minute video at the end which is not to be missed. It visually shows you what would happen if the earth's temperature rose by a mere 5 degrees. Very educational and informative (and scary)....it's not to be missed."
