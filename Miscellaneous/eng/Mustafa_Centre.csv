,,Terrible customer service,1.0,,Everyone say Mustafa is a good place to shopping because of cheap rates. But it is NOT. And also the customer service is horrible. The cashiers are treating to customers like beggers. And also of you carefully compare the prices you will understand there is no anything for cheap. Specially luggages. If there is something for cheap double check the quality of the item.
,,Amazing Shopping Center opens 24 hrs,5.0,,"An amazing shopping mall that contains all type of goods at unbeatable prices. Shopping at this complex is an experience to buy many things at cheap prices, and it’s open 24 hours. We bought many brands perfumes at very good prices. Also, we enjoyed buying many household goods with unbeatable prices."
,,From A - Z,4.0,,"It is an hypermart where u can buy A-Z of what u need. Great thing is u get most of the items u need from gold to grocery. But what i feel is costly. When u compare prices in India, Mustafa is costlier."
,,everything you find is here,4.0,,"there are many goods, if you pay more than 100 dollar SG you can refund tax here. i bought the perfume it very cheap."
,,Nice India style shopping center,4.0,,Very crowded shopping center where you can find almost anything. Always open but very crowded during daytime so visit late nights or late evening for the best shopping experience.
,,If you want to feel like being in India,4.0,,"Anyone in India who's had relatives or friends in Singapore in the 90's and early 2000's has surely heard of this place. Frankly it's nothing more than a massive supermarket, without enough space to navigate. But if you always wanted to know what the hype was about, just drop in. You can exit any time empty handed."
,,Boxes with missing chocolates,1.0,,We bought a box 12 pcs Boom Bastic chocolate box and after opening it there were only 6 pieces it is saddening to know that such famous and popular market is not able to give proper service
,,Shopping mall,5.0,,It is opened 24 hours. This mall has many shops those providing varieties of items. Even budget shop is available
,,Overrated,1.0,,The market is dated and overcrowded. Inventories are jam-packed. Staff is always on the lookout for shop-lifters. I would not recommend this place at all. Maybe for locals on the hunt for a bargain during grocery shopping.....
,,Open all hours,4.0,,"We wandered in here after eating locally and it transported me back to memories of shopping with my parents when we visited India.
Floor after floor of clothes, shoes, electricals, health products, toys etc
Worth a visit for the atmosphere
My wife and daughter loved browsing the saree section
Money changers here offer very competitive rates and are legitimate"
,,Huge and Exclusive 24/7 shopping,4.0,,"This is the identity of the little India are now. Lot of things you can buy (especially Indian stuff). You can buy things such as souvenirs, dry fruits and chocolates."
,,Sherin Nafie,4.0,,"It is a center located in Little India & open 24/7. U can buy lots of things like toys, confectionery, perfumes, toiletries, groceries, electronics, household items, clothes, .... all under one roof at v. reasonable prices. It is v busy & congested with visitors."
,,Zero star if possible,1.0,,"The only place I absolutely hated in my trip to Singapore. The management thinks every visitor is a thief so horrible security measures. But what they don't understand is that it's the policy of the management to leave things scattered all over the place that makes it prone to theft and not the people. There may be thieves but that doesn't mean every one is a thief. Also the staff is super impolite except for a few. Direction signs are also very bad and many aren't visible easily. I got fed up with in a few minutes and exited the place.
If you want a good atmosphere to shop or if you want hassle free shopping never ever go there."
,,Bargain Hunting,3.0,,This is one of the most famous shopping centres in Singapore famous for its cheap prices. You can find almost anything under one roof but the place feels very congested and it's not fun going with kids at all. If your looking for cheap stuff definitely check it out.
,,Beetle dried apricot fruit,1.0,,"Last week (21/6/2019) i brought dried apricot fruit. Yesterday (26/6/2019) i like to open the package, suddenly i was shocked!!! Inside the package beetle... The package still not yet opened. I have the item purchased bill..... How come the dried food beetle...??!!!"
,,Over hyped,2.0,,Its nothing more than a super market. Quality not so good. Better options are available elsewhere. Disappointed
,,A huge supermarket,5.0,,Mustafa center is nothing more than a huge supermarket which caters to all your needs of shopping from clothes to household stuff to perfumes to medicines and what not. The prices are decent and there are so many payment centers to take care of the rush. Place is surrounded by several Indian restaurants to cater to the food need. Overall a good place to but your stuff.
,,Cheaters,1.0,,Kindly double check your take away food.After waiting for more then half an hour..I haven’t cross checked my parcel and at home found half items were missing.
,,Good and cheap buys,4.0,,Great location for shopping and looking around. Different floors with different items at affordable rates. Staff needs more training apart from that the mall was good.
,,Can't sleep? Come here!,5.0,,"Open 24 hours. Massive, find anything you need... cheap. Excellent place to get food, snacks and trinkets."
,,Don’t Bother,2.0,,"Not worth the walk. Poor quality cloths,very hard to find anything. Unfriendly staff when you find one. Money exchange good rate not worth the walk."
,,Good staff but proper training needed,3.0,,To start of with items are not well maintained. Particularly service staff do not know the layout of the mall which led to misleading for items and we ended purchasing an item for over priced while we could have bought it for a cheaper price at the other floors. And oh boy should you require a refund it shall be a nightmare for you to go around to the basement and meet a staff to get your receipt signed and back to counter and then exchange for another item without any refund.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing place with so many choices!! would totally come back! and its open 24 hours! what else can you ask for!
,,Do not visit,1.0,,Though you get things cheap- I would advise not to visit Mustafa center- the people here do not have any experience on customer service and behave rudely.
,,Big shopping Mall,5.0,,"One in all, mean visit one place to buy anything that you need. It's number one shopping mall ever in Singapore. You can ask what goods are not available here. Mustafa is a largest mall where medicine, cloths, foods, money exchanges, watch, gold, perfume and many more items are available."
,,Extremely crowded but fun to shop,4.0,,"This shopping mall is legendary in Singapore. It is huge, sells pretty much everything, it is horribly crowded with so many aisles blocked by other visitors or by staff putting stuff on shelves so that you cannot push your shopping trolley through half of the aisles which are often blocked by cartons of goods, and it looks cheap and is very packed, but people like to come here because it sells everything, is in Little India, surrounded by some great Indian restaurants and because it is open 24 hours a day.

You can find all kinds of things here, electronics, jewellery, electronics, music DVD's, hardware, kitchenware, stationary, toys, gardening stuff, clothing, watches, camera gear, shoes, belts, wallets, hats, and pretty much anything else that you would want to find in Singapore. The supermarket is really huge and sells every variety of Indian spices you can imagine as well as a huge area selling candies, chocolates, crisps and everything in between in large bags so it is perfect for shopping to bring things home.

I am not sure if the prices are much cheaper than in other places, but it's nice because it is a one stop shopping experience. We bought all kinds of things, lots and lots of food, an electronic scale to weight baggage, books, stationary, toys, beauty products, jewellery for kids and so much more.

Just outside the store on the roadside there are plenty of taxis and easy to call a Grab car. There is also the Mustafa Cafe right outside entrance door 2 which has some good (and some less good) food."
,,Dated,2.0,,"Mustafa a few decades ago used to be the chic Singapore mall. Run and staffed by Indians, tourists from India had a particular affinity to it. I remember going to Singapore in 2000 and my Dad selected a hotel bang opposite Mustafa in Little India because that was where the action lied. 20 years on, sadly Mustafa seems caught in time warp. It has failed to update itself with the times.

Tight aisles, overflowing shelves, disinterested staff is what catches your attention everywhere. Its only USP right now is that it operates 24 hours. So at 11 in the night when we felt we could still explore around a bit we landed at Mustafa. By 11.30 we were out, exhausted by sensory overload of just too much stuff and very little attention to orderliness. Mustafa can work for you if you know what to grab, not a place to browse in peace. The deals on perfumes were good and the money changer inside and around Mustafa give a good rate."
,,Good variety but negative for customer experience,3.0,,"It’s actually ironical that in a city that prides itself on wowing customers, Mustafa with its excellent variety of consumer goods, actually fails to deliver a great customer experience. In all the years i have visited, the place has not changed, in fact i feel they have become more congested after they expanded. Aisles are crowded, sales staff are not customer focused and boxes of shelf items block the already congested rows. Sales staff look almost indifferent and will not pro actively assist you. There is hardly place for people to cross each other but if someone is wheeling a trolley, you better wish you were a skinny dude if you want to pass !. However, the variety of items from clothes to jewellery to consumer electronics, all of them at reasonable prices, overrides the other negatives. It’s a pity that Mustafa does not give priority to service and better shop floor arrangements which will make it a more exciting experience."
,,24 hours shopping centre,5.0,,"It's like a old style shopping centre, not much staff around, they can only be found at cashiers. Love to browse and shop here because they have everything!! Was kinda disappointed that 1 part of their building has to be closed down. But its still very huge. It's also crowded so you might lose your way for the first time. Its crowded because they have everything in huge quantities. Isles are just wide enough for 2 body size. They provide shopping trolleys but just be careful not to knock anyone down."
,,"Very bad service of Mustafa Sultan money exchange, Alkhuwair, Muscat",1.0,,"I had very very bad experience with Mustafa Sultan exchange, Al Khuwair. They are providing instant money transfer to India in SBI account but everytime it takes a full day for remittance in local account. One time it took two days and other day, I have to call and visit them to make the transaction again to remit my money. Everytime, they say it's due to system problem. I decided I never use their service anymore for money transfer or exchange."
,,Terrific place to spend the night,5.0,,Wow. What an amazing Shopping paradise at Singapore. You name it.. It has all. The 24x7 Shopping option just makes your days and nights in Singapore a truly memorable experience
,,"Very big, and full of items",3.0,,the mall is very big but the layout is very confusing and I got lost inside the mall awhile before finding my way out.
,,Discount shopping,4.0,,"I liked it. If you are a bargain shopper this is a must. They sell all types of goods: cosmetics, candies, electronics, blu ray / dvds, souvenirs (way cheaper than duty free), clothing, household appliances you name it and it is 24 hours! Maybe 50-100 meters from Farrer Park MRT, you can easily get lost in this discount shopping plaza. The prices are cheap, though I question how much of the goods are knock offs. Yes the items are jam packed and the crowds can make it claustrophobic. i went around 11 PM and it was still fairly busy. When most of the Singaporean stores are closed and you need something last minute late night, this is the place to be!"
,,So busy. Kind of rubbish but fab as well.,4.0,,"Heard about Mustafa’s and as we were stopping in Little India felt we had to visit. So busy, almost manically, but interesting to wander around. Didn’t buy anything but just walked around. To some it might have been pointless waste of time but fun in a weird way. To check the ‘sell everything’ view, we looked for Beetroot Tea, they don’t sell it."
,,Keep out!,1.0,,They sell everything from groceries to gold and open for business 24 hours. We went around midnight and still it was packed. Worst place to visit in Singapore unless you have sleepless nights and tempted to shop. Felt like a street market inside a congested building. Nice restaurants around for good food.
,,Not worth a visit,1.0,,Completely Indian style shop. Used each and every milimeter of space for display without considering customer convenient. Management main target is to make money somehow and anyhow. Actually govt of Singapore should close this shop.
,,Good bargain place to shop in little india,3.0,,"Okay place to visit if you looking for bargains and have time very hugh department stores were you can find any items not found in Singapore. Really bargain stores busy place especially weekends would not recommended to visit on weekends as local migrant workers comes shopping and very crowded and mostly man and one can not move just while place in the shopping centre and outside is back to back so was experience in a way

Taxi not easy to find on weekends so please keep in mind as they could refuse to pick up if it’s short trip but if you offer double the fares then surly they will pick you up as we had no choice after two rejection ,remember you need to offer as illegal for taxis to ask

Must also mention all taxis are safe is can only be driven by Singapore citizens as told and friendly"
,,Good place for grocery and home appliance shopping,3.0,,"Big place for whole day shopping. Best for groceries, stationeries, home appliances. Only problem is too congested. Best time for shopping is late evening on weekdays."
,,Very Hot inside 3rd and 4th floor and Basement,1.0,,i visited to buy some stationary items hardware items and t shirts but i run away because inside like microwave. worse experience in my life.
,,24 Hours,4.0,,"This place is busy. We went around midnight and it was packed. There are several floors and areas to explore including a currency exchange. They sell everything here from gifts, to food, clothes, books. I didn't expect it to be so busy at this time but it was really heaving. I'd recommend for a visit especially during a sleepless nights."
,,one stop shopping,4.0,,"it was the first time for me going there & i think i will be there again when in Singapore :D
when you saw it at first, it was just an ordinary supermarket (and i thought so), but once you came inside, wow.. there were many things you could find for your needs.. for souvenirs or daily needs, from foods, snacks to clothes, parfumes, etc.. and the favorite thing was the price is lower than other shops (i wanna know how could it be, anyone can explain..?) :D
also you could ask for tax refund for tourists.."
,,A good shopping destination,4.0,,"The mall offers a great variety and range of products. Also, they are running discounts always. A good stop to shop."
,,Worse and Very hot inside,1.0,,No Aircon inside very hot like staying in Africa.. 1st and 2nd lvl is ok but all the others feels like no Aircon available very terrible...
,,Cheaper locals shopping,4.0,,"After all the high end shops in orchard road you start to wonder where the locals shop - then you come here and the place is absolutely packed with people and pretty much sells everything!!!! EVERYTHING!!
My daughter bought some denim overalls and loads of people were buying all sorts of food !
Very very busy and chaotic"
,,"The place maybe messy, but its open 24-7 with many hidden treasures.",4.0,,"This is the place we always come to our mind whenever we wanted to go out in the middle of the night. Mustafa may not be a high end shop, but they do have a wide variety of products. There are so many hidden gems in the shop, as they import from around the world."
,,Selling Stale Jeera Khari - Mr. PUFF brand from Gujarat India,1.0,,"My friend was coming from Singapore. I have asked him to bring 2 packs of Mr. Puff - Jeera Khari from Mustufa Store Singapore. He bought, we open and found KHARI is STALE - bed smell and bed taste as well as no more Crispy. Really Mustufa is changed and selling more and more stale products of lousy brands such as Mr. Puff."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,It is called Mustufa market .It remains open for all 24 hrs.u get all kinds of daily necessary items fro house hold items to electronics to chocolates to drinks all in one place .There r Indiian restarants also for Vegetarians.
,,Good and Bad!,4.0,,"It is a maze - Spread across many floors the first timers would constantly get lost as we did and many would keep asking for directions. You dont even know where you enter and where you exit.

Good stuff
- You can find almost anything you want to buy in this shop - this is huge
- Some of the stuff are unique and if you have time, you can shop for good stuff
- Products from across the world and you get excellent bargain on some items
- Multiple billing counters so, very less waiting for billing

Bad stuff
- Disaster waiting to happen - No space for an emergency evacuation
- Too huge - you get lost many times
- Not very organized - similar items were found in different places confusing us (especially food)
- Very stuffy - not sure if the air con works very well

Advice: Go at a time when it is empty (ex. Noon) that would give some breathing space to shop. Overall - recommended for shopping in singapore

What to buy
- Food, diary, water
- Souvenirs
- Perfumes and body spray

Note that some of the things are cheaper just outside Mustafa and Chinatown is recommended for souvenirs and gifts"
,,Mr Micheal Ward,4.0,,"Interesting shopping centre to visit I'm sure you could find something to purchase. The floor of gold jewelry was a sight to behold, especially for the avid gold hunters."
,,Arrgghh,1.0,,"Horrible. Agree on the fire trap comment I saw previous, an accident waiting to happen. Bags taped before we were even allowed in store."
,,Good prices but deadly fire trap,2.0,,"I have visited the store in late March 2019 to buy a luggage case. Although the value was good but I will never step foot into the store again unless and until the management and the local authority improves the clamped environment and the lack of consideration of fire security. The shelves are very tightly positioned and I am not sure if it meets the requirement for emergency evacuation. It is a far cry from the other retail stores even lesser known ones. It is difficult to find elevators and when one is found there are nearly a dozen customers with trolleys queuing to get in. The parking in the basement is dimly lit. Generally it is an accident waiting to happen. If you value a cheap bargain more than your own security, then there is no debate."
,,You can find about everything you need.,5.0,,"Having read great reviews i visited three times this multistory shopping center. Bought a lot of electrical items at fantastic prices. Clothing/shoes also very cheap. Open 24 hours a day 7 days a week, 365 days a year!!!!. Always packed, mostly in the food section. I understand people fly/by train from MALAYSIA to shop here. Not enough staff to service the mass of customers. Excellent discounts on a vast variety of items. Filled two suit cases, 40kg from this shop. Customer service also very bad/slow, but prices make up for this if you know what you want."
,,Wide variety of consumer goods,5.0,,"1. Was amazed by the brnaded watches sold there... from CItizen to Seiko to Tag Haguer as only keen in these 3 brands. have other brands too.

2. Snacks department was another surprise.. targetted 30 min to be in the shopping but stayed on for 45min..

3, souveniors - located near the main entrance of watches depaerment but limited on the 1st floor... 2nd floor near the escalator and more choices."
,,Large and crowded department store,2.0,,This department store was large and crowded. Not sure it is worth a visit. You can find shops with lower prices nearby.
,,24hours with many things,5.0,,I am suprised to see such a mall operating for 24hours with all the items anyone could ask for. Although the customer service was bad but the range of items were good. Will visit the mall once again.
,,I didn’t know I needed that,4.0,,This shopping Centre is huge with so much stock. You just about need a whole day to walk through it all! I bought a backpack which I didn’t think I needed til I saw it! Worth a look.
,,Not a mall!,2.0,,"Actually a department type store, set along two city blocks and 4-5 storeys tall, crowded with mostly Indian locals and tourists, hot and largely cheap stuff."
,,A must visit Shopping Complex,5.0,,All branded items available at cheap prices. 24x7 counters opened. All you want is available under single roof. Definitely visit if you have lot of relatives to shop. Must visit for entrepreneurs who retail items once go back. Better to visit around 11pm at night and do night shopping to avoid the crowd.
,,Worst experience in Singapore!!!!!!,1.0,,"Admittedly we went at the wrong time - Sunday 6pm. But I have never ever seen so many people in one place ever! It was wall to wall people. Hard to walk around, lots of pushing and shoving. Was told by a local that is the worst possible time to go. I am not willing to give it a second shot. I will pay full price!!"
,,Be careful on your purchases,1.0,,"You can find anything under the sun at mustafa and the general notion is that prices are cheap. Prices are cheap yes, for a selected few products. We recently brought fererro chocolates from them which was at a grate bargain of about s$6/- to our dismay, we found out only later that they expire within a few weeks of the purchase. Will not be buying from them again. In general I have noticed that perfumes and deos are ultra cheap there. Just take a good look at the date of expiry before purchasing their products."
,,UNCOMFORTABLE DEPARTMENT STORE,3.0,,This a very large store full of all kinds of merchandise . I was looking for anice Indian dress but they didnt have anything worthwhile.
,,24 hour shopping complex,5.0,,This place offers 24 hours shopping experience. We can varieties of designer clothes at a reasonable price.
,,Twenty Four hour open busy affordable Mall in Singapore,5.0,,The Mall is very busy and crowded. Its stocked well with everything. Prices are less than anywhere. Location is near Little India and on main road. Recommended to stock things when you land in Singapore and before flying back. Chocolates lot of varieties and cheaper than the airport.
,,Mother of all shopping malls,4.0,,"Mustafa center is a one stop shopping destination for all you need.
Did not get the chance to see all sections, but by going by the size and the variety of products seen in the few sections I visited. This place must have all that we need.
A good place.to buy souvenirs for tourist.
However finding what you need may be tiring."
,,Amazing Visit,5.0,,"Unbeliveable store, massive too, had everything one could think of, from fresh produce, to apparel, to electronics, one can get totally lost here and go crazy shopping, prices too were very good compared to other stores i have seen with same or similiar items. a definate must visit shopping mecca in Singapore."
,,Twenty four hours,3.0,,"Mustafa centre operates 24 hours and if you are staying nearby, a good place to spend some time shopping. Not really a great mall but they do have everything under one roof!"
,,Exciting shopping but poorly organised,2.0,,"This large departmental store has a lot of stock and good products for sale. But!! They suffer from a Poor system of organising their goods. We were looking for specific health soaps and electrical items, and were shunted from one end of their store to another. Totally exhausted after running around with no success, we gave up and decided to leave the store: Good selection of products and well priced though - what a shame!"
,,Everything under one roof,5.0,,"I struggled to find for diapers for my son during my vacation. I visited more than 20 shops in different area, finally found in Mustafa Centre. To be honest, dont waste your time checking many shops, just go this place, you have everything needed."
,,The crowd tires one out!!,3.0,,Over the years the absolute glut of stuff and crowds have made me lose my interest in Mustafa. Styling is grossly lacking. For the masses only
,,I loved this place,5.0,,"This shopping center was fantastic. Maybe because it was something I have never seen before. I especially loved all the cooking products and food areas. We spent ages looking at all the spices and foods from all over the world.
The bakery has some really tasty pies and if you get there about 9.30 they will have just come out of the oven.
We bought cheap drinks, fruit and snacks to take back to our hotel. Also some spices to bring home.
I wasn't really interested in the clothes or electronics departments but hubby enjoyed those.
Staying in Little India we went there a few times during our stay. It is also open 24 hours."
,,Reminds you of a government supermarket in India,3.0,,"At one time this was the Indian shopping centre for every Indian visiting Singapore.
We used to spend hours on end to shop here. In fact Indians never knew of any other shop.
This time my visit was disappointing. It has now become a huge supermarket of substandard products . It's crazy to find what you want. It's like a huge maze. Things are littered every where. How to find quality products in this huge godown beats me. Some of the staff are not very helpful if you ask them for directions.
People say things are very cheap here. But who goes to Singapore, one of the costliest city in the world, to look for cheap Chinese products.
We were looking for some branded cosmetics and we did not find. The store was full of cheap products.
The price of electronics was very competitive. But I was not sure about the international warranty.
But Indians still throng this place."
,,Love this place!,5.0,,"Yes, it's crowded! Yes, it's junky! Yes, it's chaotic! That's what makes it such a great place to visit! My favourite departments: Ladies' Wear - great cotton tops from India at low prices. Souvenirs: a huge section for London, England souvenirs (??!!) and tacky Singapore souvenirs (although some are decent) Luggage: every possible size and brand. Check out the enormous selection of cotton batik fabric from Indonesia on the lower floor (see photo) gorgeous colours at amazing prices. Huge food department. Pleasant rooftop buffet restaurant with lots of vegetarian options. I ALWAYS visit the Mustafa Centre when I'm in Singapore."
,,Good mall,4.0,,"It is one of the famous places in singaphore.It Open 24 hours, the Mustafa Centre offers a unique market style shopping experience. Designer products are in abundance at low prices with everything from textiles to watches and electronics on sale. The mall is actually two department stores joined together with goods sold under the Mustafa name ."
,,OMG 😲,4.0,,"So thought we check this out while in Singapore, surely the reviews were correct.

It’s massive and honestly you could spend all day in there, I can’t think of anything to compare it too, it must sell everything

Each floor notes what to expect but there is just so much stuff it’s hard to describe until you get there,

Worth a look."
,,You can't believe the food section!,5.0,,"This store is two city blocks long. We spent time only on the floor that has luggage and food. Luggage is less exciting than food so we'll go there first. They have pretty much every brand of luggage that you can buy anywhere and so much of it.
But now to the foods and seasonings. You are planning to make something Indian for dinner? Shop here! We bought over 20 boxes of Indian spices to make Masala this and Madala that. A bit of everything. Also some kind of paste that you mix with some of the masala spices. They have a cereal from the USA that is half the price that it costs in the USA. The quantity of each type of item is enormous. Rows and rows of cookies and cakes from everywhere. Fresh produce, meats everything that you could find in a grocery store at home multiplied by 100.....its mind blowing. We went up to the top floor for lunch and had a perfectly delicious Indian lunch. This place is worth a visit. Plan on a few hours, and that's without seeing clothing, makeup, pharmacy, tools...you name it!"
,,Good store,4.0,,"At Mustafa Center, you can find chocolate at a lower price than elsewhere. They also sell a lot of things like electronics, body care, food."
,,Affordable Souvenirs ✌,4.0,,"Mustafa is the place to be if you want late night shopping (since it is open 24hours) where you will find cheap but worth-it, and memorable souvenirs like imported perfumes, shoes (especially rubber shoes), bags, watches, apparel, and chocolates among others that are being sold in bulk, buy one take one, etc.

Located at 145 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore, it is just a block away from where we checked-in (Tai Hoe hotel), so we visited the said place numerous times.

We bought all our souvenirs here except bookmarks, and books since you cannot find any here, or it is not just my type.

Happy shopping ✌❤"
,,One Place nothing less than offline Amazon,3.0,,"So this place offers you the smallest to largest entity that you will need in your life, it is in the heart of the City, if you are looking for anything this is a place if you an Indian/SriLankan/Malaysian so on and so forth this should be the goto place. You may find yourself cluster-phobic if you visit this on a weekend or in the day time, spare some time from your busy schedule and visit after 10 PM for a peaceful journey yes by journey i meant you have to travel from 1 block to another it could be tiering though. I have personally bought some perfumes which were half of the rate from shops in mainstream shops from complex or other malls. Do visit if you are in Singapore"
,,Crazy place,3.0,,My family didnt enjoy our visit here. Was far too crowded (we went after 11pm on week night) and no room to move around and look at anything. It is like a market inside a building and walk ways way too narrow. Has loads of stuff but is crammed into small space making it really hard to find anything. Had people going through with baby buggies and would stop and you couldn't get past.
,,Great place for budget shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"This is a 24X7 center selling anything to everything. You have wide choice and is not very expensive. However the place is slightly crowded and has narrow walking space. overall Ok for budget shopping,"
,,everything in 1 place,4.0,,"+ you can really find anything in here + wide choice + not too expensive products - too crowded, very small aisles - very bad quality products"
,,Worse 24 hour shopping center with TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,1.0,,"This is the worst place to go to BUY anything. Packed, cramped, dirty, rude staff all complement this ''horrible package''. If you have nothing to do after midnight, just take a walk in this gigantic 24 hour ''mall'' and you will get it. Crowds, baby prams, huge shopping carts jam up the tiny weeny little space that you get, and people with shopping baskets bang into your hands and legs everytime and they DONT BOTHER TO SAY SORRY at all. The only positive thing to say about here is they really sell everything and anything in the roof that you can think of. Go at your own risk, you have been warned."
,,Shopping nightmare with filthy toilets!,1.0,,"I've never seen so much JUNK under one roof. There are floors and floors of ""stuff"". If you intend to go here, be specific with what you want otherwise you'll get exhausted looking for nothing.

The staff were unhelpful and knew nothing about the products. Oh and the toilets were FILTHY! You had to buy your own toilet paper. There was water, urine and faeces all over the toilets from people washing themselves.

If you are looking for Indian branded kitchenware then this place has it all. Also, on a side note, leave your husband and children at the hotel as they will be exhausted and exhasperated after 30 mins."
,,Singapore 2019,5.0,,"We visited this centre twice while we were in Singapore. It has everything! Clothes, shoes, electronics, jewellery, toiletries, perfume, electrical goods, luggage, kitchenware, chocolate and lots of it, all at competitive prices. Just be aware they will zip-tie your plastic carry bag (and part of your backpack) when you enter and seal your purchases the same way too. Really enjoyed our visits just looking around and buying a few things to take home."
,,Interestingly crowded!,3.0,,"I assume it’s a typical Indian mall since it’s located in little India. It’s actually kinda interesting to me to visit a “mall” with a different concept —- no fancy display windows or decoration but tons of goods (from electronic appliances to daily groceries) on shelves and racks from wall to wall and from floor to ceiling. They use every inch of the space to store as many products as possible.

I wasn’t bothered by the very narrow aisles that much. It is kinda fun and new to me. If you happen to be in little India, it’s not a bad idea to check it out. But I wouldn’t say it’s a must!"
,,Tons of cheap items,3.0,,"Mustafa Centre is in the middle of Little India, and it is mostly Indians who shop here. In almost every basket I saw toiletries, like Dove body wash. Some items, especially personal care, are of name brands. The clothing was often of inferior quality. There were some name brands, but at name brand prices and I did not see them flying off of the shelves. I think for the most part, the Indian shopper has little spending money and must search for bargains and can find them here. Mustafa Centre resides on both sides if the street, and offers everything from food to gold jewelry within two multi story buildings. Electric kitchen appliances, phones, accessories, bicycles, sandals....this place has it all. The grocery has some very narrow aisles, impossible tor two carts to pass each other. The floor here was far from clean, and I would hesitate to buy my food here. I felt that I had a third world experience shopping here, but I'm not knocking it. It's just that I had a very different opinion of Singapore from my first visit than I do now. My hotel was across the street from City Square Mall, a typical mall experience with American fast food offered as well as more Singaporean food upstairs at the food court. And yet, Mustafa Centre was just a couple of blocks in the opposite direction. I had good access to all the area had to offer, and Mustafa Centre was an experience I'm glad I got to share."
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,"All item from grocery, clothes, jewellery etc totally super cheap!! Easy to get all types of transportation... We all prefer grab cause only in Singapore we can get expensive car for our ride..🤣🤣🤣"
,,EVERYTHING IS HERE!,4.0,,"I thought they were kidding when they told me that everything is here and that they are open 24/7. All of them were true. I was amazed with how many their selections are. It is rows and rows and rows of food, chocolates, kitchenware, drinks, toiletries - name it they have it. I would probably get lost here if I was alone. They could probably improve on the walking space though as it tends to be a bit crampy and we were bumping into other people."
,,Really Big store,3.0,,Price wise it is almost similar to Indian prices .quailty wise items not that good.its really big store with 5 levels and length wise almost 800 meters.some products are are worth buying
,,Not very impressed,3.0,,"This is a massive shopping Centre which does as it says, sell just about everything. It goes across a number of buildings and takes some navigation. The staff are helpful but it can be difficult to find what you want and prices are comparable to elsewhere. Recommend you don’t, as we did try to take a child’s buggy as the whole place is cluttered and busy and not conducive to buggy’s or wheelchairs.
Going round it is something of an experience so if you have a spare afternoon and the weather is bad it’s wirth a visit."
,,Open 24 hours - shopping,5.0,,"A great place to go.. Great bargains. Anytime, any day. Opens 24 hours. You can buy almost anything under the sun 👍"
,,24/7 shopping mall where you can buy anything. Almos,3.0,,"Located in Little India, this is a place where you want to go if you don'want to go through many places to searxh for something. This place will probably have it. 3 floors, me and my friend walked through druh store only and it was enough. The place doesn't hold everything so I needed to go to Sasa, as I wanted to buy Neogen products."
,,An experience to be had - once,3.0,,"This is an overwhelmingly massive shopping center with an odd juxtaposition of all the things -- cut through the men's clothing and you'll find... a gold shop. It's worth checking out for the sheer mass of it and if you happen to need to buy something -- like Tiger Balm products to take home as souvenir gifts -- you'll find the biggest selection and likely the best prices around town. And if you're in the market for Indian spices and other specialties, you'll find it all. But if you have nothing to buy, it can be overwhelming. In that case, step in to enjoy the respite from the heat for a bit and then be on your way."
,,OMG - an Indian department store in Singapore,2.0,,"The owners have managed to transfer the sub-continent's atmosphere into a warren of stuff for sale in Singapore. Over several floors there are a lot of things for your everyday needs. The myth that prices here are any different from all the other 'normal' shops is just that, a myth. Simply good PR.The choice of electronics is rather limited and caution is advised regarding warranty and 'low prices'."
,,One stop Shop.,4.0,,"If you want cheap branded goods, inexpensive clothing and tech then go to Mustafa. This is a great mall and you can eat, shop and go for a massage all in one place. Only negative way too many touts."

,,Vast,4.0,,"It's a big big bit shopping centre, one can get anything we want , prices are reasonable , most tourists visit this place for shopping for souvenirs , chocolates etc , workers are helpful but again they lack basic smile ( Singaporeans are like this only ? ) it's open 24 hrs , so one can go anytime one wants,"
,,Amazing store,4.0,,You may have problems finding a camel here but I am sure you can find most things. The food sections are fantastic and very crowded but they carry foods from the whole world. The upstairs restaurant was one of the better meals that we had in Singapore. The outside cafe on the street was passable if you ordered things like aloo gobr.
,,Spellbound,5.0,,Every thing on earth is available here. An excellent and exclusive place for Indian shopping. Very crowded almost all the time. There are several floors but most of them are congested. Still it is a very good place for a happy shopping. I particularly liked the gold shop here.
,,One stop Mall,4.0,,"Located towards the end of Orchard Street , this centre offers everything in the multi layer set up. From electronics to food everything is here. Prices are competitive as there is a diversity of items for sale.
Each layer has its own treat. One the top layer there are restaurants and my favourite been the Indian Restaurant with amazing Chicken Tika Masala. A must do when in Singapore"
,,A lot of people,4.0,,"DO NOT come here on a Sunday!! Packed with people and you have to queue to get in.Generally avoid coming on weekends. They sell all sorts of stuff here.Whatever u need,they are sure to have it."
,,India in Singapore,4.0,,"For a tiny island like Singapore, Mustafa Centre is humongous by its standards.

You can buy almost anything here. Many come here to shop as they are attracted by the prices. Buyer needs to be beware though, especially for electronic equipment, where prices are attractive as they do not provide international warranty.

This place certainly gives you the vibe of being in a mall in India. In fact, a local friend of mine joked that you can find spices here that you can't even find in India."
,,Shopping place,5.0,,"You can find everything in this place, food, clothes, medicines, jewelry, etc. Very easy to go there ( MRT / Bus)"
,,Love mustafas,5.0,,"Cannot ever check it all out.
Love the souvenirs and candy at reasonable prices .
It's only the amount of people in small aisles that are an issue....
Good quality merchandise if a little scattered in direction......
I always find a bargain and enjoy it for the feel of the place asmu h as for the shopping."
,,"Destination, 24/7 Shopping at Singapore",4.0,,"When you want Value for money, budget friendly , no frills shopping experience at Singapore, you head straight to Mustafa .

This place has 4 entrances and are connected internally. It offers whatever Indian items you can think of and more. The place is open 24/7 and that is one of it's biggest USPs . It also houses Foreign Exchange Currency counter , a small cafe for a quick bite.

You need atleast 3/4 hours if you are looking to buys grocery, and other household items."
,,Huge 24/7/365 shopping Center.,3.0,,"Located at the suburb of Little India, this five floors malls offres mostly bargains, but in the basement floor the luxurious indian gold jewelry is for sale!"
,,super multi product store,4.0,,"This three floor shopping complex is a mega place. It covers one full street. To buy any thing you want, this is the best place to choose from wide range at reasonable price. Electronics, and electric items, Jewelry, foot wear, Luggage. apparels, watches, shoes, home décor, crockery, utensils, grocery, fruits, vegetables, meat and fish, canned food, dairy products etc. The list is indicative. Even visa, passport and money changing services are given very efficiently by them. They are open 24 hours and at any point of time, it is full with customers. They also run a canteen serving tasty fast food. A must visit place, if not to buy, to do window shopping."
,,one stop shop,5.0,,"great affordable shopping options. massive centre, but really crowded, no matter what time you visit."
,,Excellent place to shop for every thing!,5.0,,Shop till you drop! Excellent places to do all your shopping literally everything! Go at late hours such as 3am for a better walk way as its mostly crowded during day time till late. We enjoyed!
,,My favourite place in Singapore!,5.0,,This place is the best! It has a lot of varieties of items and it's SO AFFORDABLE! It's also very easy to get to! I love it! It's so convenient and it's just brilliant!
,,Anything and Everything that one can shop under one roof at very reasonable price !!!,4.0,,"Mustafa shopping centre has about 6 entrances and it runs from one end of the road to the other, almost for a kilometer, its that big. The place is about 5-6 stories including 2-3 in the basement. One can shop for anything and everything under one roof. Best thing is that they are open 24 hours and this really helps tourists like us to optimally use our time. During the day we did sight seeing and other shopping at high end malls, at night did shopping at Mustafa !!!

They offer probably the highest variety of original perfumes at the best possible price. The variety of electronics and chocolates was also superb. One can go on and on....... Please remember to have place for carrying all the shopping bags home !!!

They also have a huge jewelry section. One can get the GST refund process also done here if the total billing is above Rs.100 in one day across maximum 3 bills. Please remember to carry your passport for the same. They also have money changing operations and the rate is very competitive."
,,shopping spree in Mustafa,4.0,,I found that the Mustafa centre was open 24 hours and I went for my shopping at Mustafa which caters to everyone. You can find Pin to Plane at the Mustafa and so budgeted for shopping including lots of gifts to your family and friends. My shopping was memorable at Mustafa
,,One stop destination for almost everything,4.0,,"So every visit, this is the first place we visit on our fist day to get all the basics for our stay. Weekends and evening is a lot of rush so I prefer the afternoon or mornings. The varieties of things available for every item is an advantage as one gets a choice to choose. They stock a wide range of excellent quality spices and dry fruits and nuts. The toy section is another kid’s heaven for my young children ."
,,Everything you can think of under one roof,3.0,,"We decided to follow our taxi driver's advice and go to Mustafa's as he described it as a unique place to visit.
Apart from live animals, they really sell everything you can think of but it's quite messy.
The place is huge and the system of stairs and lift is a tad difficult to understand.
There are toilets on site but they were not for the faint hearted!
It wasn't really a must see for us but I can see with so many people go."
,,It’s an experience,3.0,,The Mustafa Centre was ... overwhelming. Multiple levels and buildings with stock just packed here there and everywhere. If you are happy to dig and get knocked around a little by other shoppers or randomly places objects to find that one cool item then this is the place for you. They have everything from sporting goods the chemist needs. I got some cool shoes at a third of the price and was very happy but it was full on and a little smelly. Would defiantly recommend for the experience but don’t be shocked if you don’t actually find anything you want to buy.
,,Bargains of varying quality,3.0,,"If you have an appetite for shopping for bargins (that might or might not be counterfeit) in an atmosphere of crowded, eccentric chaos, then the Mustafa Centre is for you! A fun experience none-the-less."
,,Shopping! Shipping!! Shoppoing!!!,5.0,,Title says it all. For tourists fond of shopping; this is one of the must visit places in Dubai. Open for 24 hours & u get things right from niddle to------------
,,The place to buy Gold Jewellery in Mustaffa Shopping center,5.0,,This is the best place to buy gold jewellery in little India. Trust me guys this is the cheapest place among all Goldsmiths in Little india period. Weight and Workmanship Price stated clearly in the Tag. The workmanship the cheapest no need to bargain. Most Braclets got no workmanship. If you are foreigners you can get Gst refund instantly.
,,Visit to Mustafa is a MUST in Singapore,4.0,,"Your visit to Singapore will be considered incomplete if you haven't visited Mustafa. Its a Shopping world in itself. Spread across multiple building and several floors including basements, it offers every item that you can think of from shopping perspective. One can spend here complete day. If you are travelling outside Singapore after your shopping, dont forget to collect your GST Invoice and collect GST Refund at the Airport."
,,An authentic experience!,5.0,,"Whoever tells you this place is dirty and noisy- don’t listen! I had a wonderful time exploring all Mustafa has to offer. The stationary section on level 4 was about half the price of uniball, pilot etc that we see in Australia. Food stuffs on level 3 was interesting and I loved the beautiful Sari garments and traditional Muslim attire on the lower levels. Perfume prices on par with Australia so I didn’t purchase however a good selection."
,,"must visual shopping , change from normal singapore style ..",4.0,,"must visit if you go singapore ..
it’s situated in a road called little india in singapore.. many products are cheaper then normal .: and this is a one stop for all your shopping needs .. they sell everything under the sun .. and it’s 24 hours open .. have restaurants also .. so you can’t go wrong going here"
,,Steer clear of this place,1.0,,"Really, I mean it!! I did not understand what the hype about this place is for!! Its in the dirtiest street in Singapore. The store itself is nothing great.
The quality of stuff is Bad, the branded ones are very few and very expensive.
I went to their ladies handbag section, a total of 7-8 rows, cheapie bags hung everywhere - the kind you would get here in Street Shopping In India (Fashion street bombay, Janpath/Palika in Delhi and Commercial Street in Bangalore) There are 2 rows of Guess bags - very limited selection and the prices are much more than what you would pay in US and for that matter even in India (if you shop online).
Corelle section - much expensive than India and very limited seclection
Shoes - BAD
Clothes - Saw a reebok T shirt while passing buy and just thought of checking the price - 60SGD and I was like What??
Limited perfumes - some are cheaper than India- so if you have to buy loads of them, maybe you should go then..I still wouldnt recommend.
And if you have to visit their bathrooms - YUCK. Dirty and stinky.
I met a lone non-asian foreigner there and blurted out that these are the dirtiest bathrooms I have seen in Singapore and she was like - ""our taxi driver told us you should visit Mustafa, its brialliant. Its dirty and an experience""
Steer clear, you have been warned :)"
,,Shopping at mustafa,4.0,,Varieties of choices can be chosen with fair prices.Even get dizzy in the middle of goods from the whole centre.But toilets should be cleaner and should be with toilet papers and water.
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"If you haven’t been at this place, you hve not seen singapore. This place have everything, whatever you think, they have it, that too in abundance. From shoes to medicines everything is available at very good prices. Genuine things are sold by them at cheaper rates due to the bulk lots they have."
,,"They have nearly everything (electronics, gadgets, foods, clothes etc). Lots of stuff at cheaper price.",4.0,,"They have nearly everything with cheaper price. For example, I believe the perfume section carries cheapest authentic perfume you can find in Singapore. But you will have to know what you are looking for since the display/shop arrangement is more like supermarket than the 'proper' shop display. For shopaholic, you can spend 3-4 hours here and still have something to buy."
,,Lost for words,4.0,,"I had heard of Mustafa before but nothing could have prepared me for what it actually is. Despite its massive size, the staff were well educated on where each product is placed, and there are millions of products available (not kidding about that)! Every Indian, Chinese, Arab, Thai, Afghani, etc item imaginable can be found there. AND they stock the cheapest chocolates one can find in Singapore (problem of gifts solved ). Take out atleast a full day to visit this remarkable place, and the food stalls around it are quite amazing too"
,,Mustafa Center,5.0,,"Wow this is like the military hangar filled with goodies.prices,are affordable and easy to find and if hungry food is available. As a financial counselor I look for pricing and accessibility for my clients as this place will fit into their budget due to affordability.😁"
,,Like shopping in a sweaty sardine can,3.0,,Ok.. sure its open 24x7 and they have a huge range of items… but could do without the 1000’s of other sweaty shoppers and stock pilled up in the walkways… which makes for a frustrating slow and difficult shopping experience.
,,Money Change,5.0,,Needed to get local currency and was recommended by the concierge to visit Mustafa Centre as there were many to choose from. As recommended attended and they were competitive with excellent exchange rates for my conversion from AUD $
,,Lots of Choices but beware,3.0,,"What I Like
Choices of goods which I cannot get anywhere else in Singapore.Prices are generally value for money but not necessarily the cheapest. Every type of rice you can imagine.

What I dislike about the place

Dirty filthy toilets. Not enough room for trolleys between the aisle.Geneally goods are dumped rather than displayed. Not stroller friendly not wheelchair friendly. No prayer room for Muslims which is Really strange. Even when we broke fast at the restaurant on 7th floor, we had to pray in an open area near the kitchen. APALLING!
In short, really interesting atmosphere if you are not claustrophobic and an ocd."
,,All is one shopping paradise with horrible staffs!,4.0,,"This is probably the only shopping mall in Singapore that operates 24/7 all around the clock. It offered money changer at excellent rates, watches, luggage, Toys, medicines, supermarket, gold shop, shoes, hardware, perfumes and items all over the world. The pricing is very reasonable but the place is rather disorganized and it takes time to find. The only issue I have are their ignorant & extremely unhelpful staff who knew nothing about the products. So, it is pretty much self-service! If you really need to get electronics like handphone or even need to get currency exchanged, I would suggest you visit Taqwa Foreign Exchange @ 128 Syed Alwi Rd, Singapore 207692 instead for better deals and service."
,,"Huge range of products with an equally large ""non-performing"", indifferent staff radiating "" Idon't care"" attitude",1.0,,"Visiting Little India, I decided to visit this large shop, better described as an open view warehouse. Anything you can think of, you can probably find it, I suspect. But if you need any information, the persons, often males sitting around display desks appear to know very little, and offer little information of worth. I am sure this open display warehouse is profitable. If the old, non-performing staff did their jobs, the place would be ore helpful.
I did buy some chocolates from Switzerland and Italy, and the prices are acceptable.
Still, it is a place worth visiting for the UNIQUE experience. If you are short of time, you do not have to worry about the clock -- it is open 24 hours or 24 x7 a week."
,,Just about anything you can think of,4.0,,Mustafa covers several city blocks in assorted stores. Looking items from yester-year or hot items of today? You will probably find it at Mustafa. Also good souvenir shopping. If you have free time and wondering what to do... give it a go. It is located in little India and worth the trip.
,,Not a comfortable place to shop,3.0,,"They are located in the heart of the city and they have almost every you need. But as for us it’s a bad shopping experience. The place is so cramped that you can’t go about without rubbing against you and stepping over your feet.
Their prices are normal. But the serve is very very bad. The staff is ignorant and arrogant at the same time. I don’t think management has taken any effort to train them in customer service. As for us it’s a nightmare to shop there as a family. For the first timers in Singapore maybe good. But definitely I don’t recommend."
,,If you want it - they got it,5.0,,An amazing shop which spans forever. They see to sell everything. It is 3 or 4 floors in 2 buildings and open 24 hours. Whatever you want this is the place to get it. If you don’t want anything this is the place to go see. I have see many large shops but. I thing like this one before. As it’s 24 hours make it one of your last stops for the day.
,,No Reason Not to Visit Mustafa Centre,5.0,,A must visit place in Singapore. You’ll find everything and almost anything you want in this world in Mustafa. I’m absolutely DITTO with all 4 & 5 stars reviews made.
,,shopping & dining,5.0,,"where you can find almost everything and anything under one Roof! great dining on the roof top & fast food along the alley, convenience place with train station and public transport to anywhere in Singapore.. Shopping Paradise!"
,,Great Shopping Mall,5.0,,"My friend and I visited Singapore in December 2018 and we decided to have a visit to this place. One thing I can say that this place is absolutely a good place to shop if you are looking for things like perfume, cosmetic products and other things. It is open 24 hours and if you don't like the hassle, do go to this mall at midnight or wee hours in the morning. One more thing is that there are lots of Halal restaurants surrounding the mall and if you are out of case, fret not as there are ample money changers there.
Happy shopping folks."
,,All in one roof,4.0,,"Great place, shop all under one roof. From fresh food and Jewelry, you can't go wrong, fixed price, haggle free, you know exactly what your are getting, no messing about.
Restaurant: nice food, open 24 hours. Be aware for fruits, weigh up in separate queue before going to the cashier"
,,"Food, shampoo, souvenirs the lot",4.0,,"The Mustafa centre is, from the outside, just another store with a few floors of goods. When you go inside it is 5 floors of shopping. From clothes, to toiletries, food, souvenirs, chocolate, sweets, dried goods, electronics etc it had everything. It is very big, about the size of a football pitch, crammed with everything you need to take home as gifts. prices were very good and they take cash and card. It is so big it took 3 attempts to find the escalators down to go out but it was a great experience."
,,Great shopping centre.,4.0,,"There is really lots here. From cosmetic to toys to sports, shoes, CDs, electric equipment. All for good prices. Quite busy on weekends."
,,All you need is here - Budget shopping shop,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a favorite place of many tourists and local residents located in little India.

Located at 145 Syed Alwi Road – the heart of Little India, near Serangoon Plaza and City Square Mall. You can use Buses: 21, 125 and 130 (Walk 4 mins from bus stop B07231) or Nearest MRT station: Farrer Park MRT (NE8) (Walk 3 mins from Exit G)

This shopping centre opens 24 hours per day and offers all kinds of products. Literally all you need to find is here huge selection of goods, including jewellery, gold and silver, consumer electronics, fashions, shoes, watches, cosmetics, perfumes, toiletries, medicinal products, household items, stationery, furniture, hardware, books, CDs, DVDs, groceries, confectioneries souvenirs and many other types of products the quality is various there some just China product flooding but there some good quality’s you need to be detailed in looking what you need.

If you bring bag of shopping before enter this shops it need to secured-by security guard so better not bring anything other than your bag pack /purse. The minus of this shopping is quite jam pack full of people in weekend and they use lot of plastic bag for any purchases in any level"
,,mustafa at 2am,4.0,,"we usually go to mustafa during midnight to dawn when there aren't much peoole. because of that, we're freer to roam the avenues and halls and choose to our hearts content. dinged one star off because while essentially complete, some brands were not the latest."
,,Excellent Experience with Mustafa centre....,4.0,,Im from India My personal experience with mustafa was really grt ... all perfumes are original and cheaper from Indian market... i hv purchased branded watches like titan on 40 % discount absoulty perfect... Headphone also very cheap in price ... but i am recommend not to buy heavy electronic stuffs like mobile camera and Lcd otherwise its ok to buy anything even toys also ....
,,"Nice, but a little disorganised",4.0,,"Mustafa Center is in the heart of Little India - an all-in-one store where you get souvenirs and items of many different varieties.

It is very big as well - we were at times lost inside it and had to ask for help from the staff. We bought all our souvenirs from Mustafa Center. They were rightly priced. I generally prefer buying from fixed price shops, the souvenirs so it served my purpose well. Moreover, as a result of Diwali festival, they had sweets ""air-flown"" from India - a thing I liked.

However, it is in dire need of improvement. One thing among others that I'd like to point out is that it is a bit disorganised, with poor labelling that leads to confusion. May a site map be provided to navigate one's way or at least, a good system of signage must develop.

Otherwise, the attitude of the staff needs to change - in a sophisticated city, the staff needs to reach that standard. Moreover, the place is a bit cramped - may think of an extension?

But these things shouldn't dissuade others to visit Mustafa Center - it is actually quite nice to buy watches, cosmetics, shampoos, other items of daily necessities, and for tourists, of course, souvenirs!

Recommended."
,,Shopping,4.0,,This place is crazy so many things the place just keeps going. The isles are tight you are always running into someone but bargains are to be had!
,,Simply an experience,5.0,,"I dont go to shopping centers, they annoy every bone in my body! Mustafa Centre is no different, but here you get more, this is not just consumerism, this is a show! Of how people get lured into buying plads of theonas they dont need! In such a small place they manage to cramp in EVERYTHING! But be prepared to walk sideways"
,,value for money,4.0,,"A typical Indian store with a widest range available at economical rates, it also houses an Indian restaurant at the top floor of one of the stores but it's certainly not a premium place."
,,mustafa centre - 24 hours shopping arcade,5.0,,24 hours accessible shopping arcade with all amenities deemed essential. excellent place find everything required under one roof.
,,"It is shopping mall. Must say, like Big Bazaar, shoppers stop & electricity mart together",3.0,,"It is not a tourist destination, but a 24 hrs shopping arcade. You can get some good deals on Chocolate or Singapore famous Tiger Balm to take & gift to your family & friends."
,,Very glad shopping experience in mustafa,5.0,,I just gone for a View in watch section in mustafa. But all of a sudden i purchased a watch. Thanks for a beautiful watch adventure with the sales person Mr.Nawaz sharriff. I'm so delighted by his customer centric approach.
,,A must visit for cheap shopping,4.0,,"This place is a must visit for Indians and Asians for it's cheap shopping options. The electronics, chocolates, bags and perfume section is a must visit. We got a skybag luggage for half of what it's sold for in India and same goes for Guess bag for women. The styles are old but the price is gold! As for perfumes, many testers are spent, so it will be better to know your fragrance before you reach here. They seem pretty authentic to me and all kinds of luxury perfumes are available for men and women!"
,,Shopping time!!,5.0,,"OMG, this is so great.. shopping center that provides a lot of your daily needs, we got so many cheap compare in my country.. happy shopping guys"
,,It never sleeps!,4.0,,"It’s such a gigantic mall to shop and it has so many things to offer. However, it takes a lot of efforts to find the right thing and quality of the majority of the products are in question; albeit cheap so it attracts a large community especially who live nearby. It’s a walking distance from little India. In my business trip, I had to pick some stuff for home and Mustafa center came really handy. The best part about this market is that the shops are open 24/7; so it never rests really and it has that crowd all night long. Great experience indeed"
,,Shoppers heaven,5.0,,Its a shop till you drop location... prices are good... slightly crowded on weekends Open 24hrs Good indian Halal food outlets around the location also open 24/7
,,Bargain shopping,4.0,,Good Value for money outlet that sells everything you could want. It is very crowded on the weekends. So plan in advance before going.
,,Good departmental store at best,3.0,,"This place is over-hyped. This is a good departmental store at best and nothing remotely a shopping mall per se. There are daily goods which can be available at cheap price, but thats it. There are a lot of good shopping center at Singapore, so if you are looking for a shopping mall, dont come here."
,,If you want it they will have it,3.0,,"This place is Amazing and Hugh! It is packed with people and hard to navigate and find what you are looking for, but it will be somewhere in the store."
,,Love to come here,4.0,,"I have been coming here for decades when I am in town. It is crowded but a good place to shop if you are looking for good value. Their bag section is good but watch out some designer stuff is not legit.

All in all a good place to go."
,,Overrated for tourist,3.0,,"It’s a great place for the locals for cheap shopping ; if you are from overseas, I don’t think you find anything different than stuff from eBay ; in fact eBay stuff a bit cheaper and don’t have to walk in that crowded shop"
,,Everytime go Mustafa when we stay in Singapore.,5.0,,"Such a good place to shop and Good price compared to another places. No worry about open and close time there, quite 24h. If you are looking for shopping centre this is another list to add on."
,,Poor service very BAD!,1.0,,Extremely poor service by the staff here. Not willing to help at all! Worst they don't even know what are the items being sold in the mall. Bought a car seat cushion for $52 per price only to know they have those $3 seat cushion Whoch I enquired earlier to the cashier. She mentioned there is no such thing sold. Wanted a refund immediately but had to go and visit the supervisor and manager at basment for signature on the receipt only to find out no refund only exchange of items for same price available. Really bad!
,,Sprawling Complex,4.0,,"When in Little India you will undoubtedly visit this store. Over the years we have seen it grow in area and spread to adjacent blocks. On this visit we entered near the cafe as the entire frontage was barricaded and seemingly undergoing major adjustment, no doubt we will marvel at the changes on our next visit. Open 24/7, it stocks just about every type of merchandise; an Aladdin's trove of products of varying quality and style displayed over 37,000m2 in the main store and three wings .It's all here, clothing, household items, foodstuffs, electrical goods, electronics, luggage, jewelry, cosmetics and more. So easy to lose your way in the packed aisles and you can easily be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of goods on offer. In many respects the store is old fashioned; simple checkouts, plastic bags secured by cable ties, not many labour saving facilities in evidence. The lot is protected by the eagle eyed staff and security on patrol at the exits. Woe betide you if a cable tie is missing from a bag when you exit. You really have to ask staff for assistance, I cannot recall ever being approached by a staff member to offer assistance. They are a dour lot with none of the exuberance displayed elsewhere in the neighborhood."
,,"All ur need, under one roof",5.0,,"If u r in tight schedule and can not manage time for shopping, u can go to Mustafa Center. It’s 24 /7 open. Also u can find all shopping stuffs under one roof. Please do not forget to ask the sales person about ur desired products or else u will be lost finding the desired one. Price is not cheap. Stuffs are very good behaved. Must visit in SG."
,,Very full on!,4.0,,"This place is massive - it covers a city block and is several stories high. It sells pretty much everything you could ever want, although some of the products are very junky. Don’t take a backpack or handbag unless you’re prepared to check it in - you can’t take them inside. Range of women’s clothing was a bit disappointing. Luggage and bags section is great and very well priced."
,,A good place to spend a few hours,4.0,,"I always like to enter and exit through the same door so that I can find my way back to Farrer Park MRT Station. But this place is huge. It's like a maze, and quite easy to lose your bearings inside. (I wouldn't fancy my chances if there was ever a fire in there). Before you go in, if you're carrying a haversack, a member of staff will seal your bag with a plastic cable tie. You can ask them to take it off once you come out. I've been a few times and found that the best time to visit is before midday. After that it is packed, and quite hard to navigate the narrow isles. This place seems to stock anything and everything. I would have given it a five star rating if it wasn't for the staff. In all my global travels I have never come across such miserable people. Service with a smile? FORGET IT. It must be company policy to look as stern and unfriendly as possible"
,,Easily spend 3 to 4 hours wandering through this huge department store.,5.0,,"Located in Singapore's Little India. Used MRT to arrive at Little India Station but after a long walk trying to locate it we found Farrer MRT the closest to leave. This Centre is 24/7 and it caters for everything. I'm sure they even sold kitchen sinks!!! Makeup, clothing, linen, electrical. It's all here."
,,You can get anything in Mustafa!,5.0,,The place is in the middle of Little India in Singapore and almost defines little India. This place has an interesting history behind it and do know the story before paying a visit. You can anything and everything here. Even Indian items which you cannot find in India can be found here. Do watch out for cheap offers on beauty products and perfumes. You can sometimes cheaper than duty free shops in Changi Airport. Do note that this center is open for 24 hours. You can also claim GST refund if you buy from here. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here.
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"The 24 hours mall is simply gigantic. It has several floors and spreads across an entire block. And a lot of great deals can be found here for tourists. A lot of locals also shop here. Gifts, groceries, perfumes, luggage, chocolates, food, cosmetics everything you need is available at Mustafa 24x7."
,,Unprofessional Staff! Very bad experience!,1.0,,"I never thought our Singapore experience would have something bad to remember.

I was looking forward to my Mustafa Mall experience since a lot of people are mentioning about it and the things you can buy in it.

But I think, I will never set foot here again even if I go back in Singapore next time. My boyfriend and I decided to leave our bags on counter #6 where shoppers leave their bags before they shop. We went inside the mall to look for souvenirs that we can buy. However, after looking around, we did not seem to find the things we were looking for, just like the things we can find at Chinatown.

Because of that, we decided to go out of the Mall, to look for other stalls. Then, we ate lunch outside... When we found out that there is another Mustafa Mall building, we quickly went inside again, hoping to find souvenir items we can buy. But still, we did not find something we want to buy.

When we came back at counter 6, it was already a different person assigned there. This time, a lady. She shouted at us angrily like she is the owner of the mall, why we left our bags and we were not able to buy anything.

Really?! It is policy in the first place to leave large bags before entering a mall also for the mall's security reasons. 2nd, we really did go there to buy something, but turns out, we did not find the items.

Also, we may not be able to buy anything this time, but still, we can go back in the future and even tell our friends about the mall.

But turns out, I'll tell every person I know NOT TO GO HERE."
,,"24/7 shopping, they sell everything!",4.0,,You can find anything and everything here! The place is huge and always crowded with locals and tourists. They are open 24 hours so go during the odd hours to avoid the crowd. Supermarket on the top floor sells traditional indian snacks. Half of the basement is dedicated to gold which was an eye opener. Cheap perfumes on Level 1 (better than duty free)!
,,All in one store,5.0,,"Being here to buy souvenirs. They have almost everything from electronic, shirts, bag, souvenirs, cosmetics, until food and beverage. Just be careful about your budget since the items are very tempting and low cost but it will takes your wallet away when you pay it. And don't forget to request the GST refund."
,,Room for improvement: Customer service,2.0,,"Went there because it had been offered as a must see. They sell e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g; known as the last minute shopping centre. If they do not have it here, then you will not find it. Seems to be cheap in comparison with the rest of Singapore but not sure.
The cashiers and random employers working and walking around are not really helpful. E.g. was looking for an SD card which were available behind a counter and this lady jerk saw we were struggling matching pricing and GB since it was kind of tough reading the prices. She just randomly stared at us and when i called her over the only thing she did was saying ""you need to choose"". Well, you could help us choosing?
Not sure either if this shop has ever heard of the oceans plastic soup? Literally everything you buy will be packed in...a plastic bag; so make sure to go either very late in the evening or early morning. Collect a basket, drop everything in it you wish to buy and try have it put in 1 plastic bag. And trust me, they do not sell everything but its for sure an adventure just randomly walking around"
,,Souvenir shopping central,5.0,,"This place must be experienced. Either come here day 1 or the last day of your holiday. Buy everything you forgot to bring, from toiletries to power adaptors, or pay a better price for every souvenir of Singapore you could need. They zip lock any bag you're carrying when you enter and zip lock any bags of items when you pay for them. It's their means of theft control. Floors and floors of narrow, overcrowded merchandise. Like a high end $2 store."
,,That is why Indians love this place,5.0,,This is a awesome place to spend time and get bargains. Indians go there for the gold and electronics primarily. Spans across a street and at several levels.
,,All-around awesomeness!,4.0,,"Get lost in this place's multifaceted offers! Almost everything you look for, come here, and they've got it for you! A wonderful place to shop."
,,One-stop shop,5.0,,"It was about 3am when we visited the Mustafa Shopping Center and I was surprised to see that the place is actually open. It sure was big, with sections for tech, cookware, bath and body, stationery, and everything in between. Nice place to shop."
,,An experience!,4.0,,"Wow - how do you describe this place! Busy, overcrowded and in the heart of Little India. A place you have to experience and a million miles away from the serenity and posh shops in Ion Orchard. If you want to visit a shop with thousands of items this is the place for you from wireless speakers to shower gel! It's an experience that will leave you a little perplexed but in a good way."
,,Little india - mustafa centre,4.0,,"So been to mustafa today. Best part - got a good exchange rate. Basically i am comparing it to a money changer in orchard ion mall.
Mustafa centre is a major shopping centre in Little India and its got everything u name it.
Food, clothes,jewellery, toys.gadgets.
Its a great as its a one stop for shopping. Loads of tourists seen there."
,,Lost in the crowd now,3.0,,"Mustafa Centre was the go-to place for reasonably priced items and bargains. No more. Prices are now more in line with what you'd pay at other places, and the sheer size of it means you can't find anything in a hurry. Staff are fairly helpful when you can find them. Best place to get things like cheap chocolates, costume jewellery, some toys and electronics. Very crowded on weekends so best to go on a weekday morning."
,,All in One Shop,5.0,,Good Super market and very reasonable rate to the consumers and good infra structured and choice is left to consumers
,,visit,5.0,,it is foresure worth a visit its open 24 hours and you find anything clothing to groceries will foresure visit again but foresure not during peak hours
,,counterfeit?,1.0,,"i bought the saem 99% jeju fresh aloe soothing gel on mustafa,only 4.90$, but it is different from the original one that i bought from the saem official store indonesia (which is around 10.9$ approximately quite same with the korea price and the official store i believe is original because they won’t dare to sell counterfeit product). the real one has more bubbles on the product, slight color difference on the front jar, but the big difference is the back jar, the location of the bar code and the text box on the bottom is very different. wonder is their product a counterfeit? if yes, how come they really dare to sell counterfeit product on singapore big dept store?the 1st-3rd pictures are from mustafa, the others from the official store. same batch exp on 2021."
,,Visited for the restaurant on the roof.,4.0,,"Have been to Mustafa centre many times and told myself would never visit again because of the general absolute chaos - but I was persuaded to visit again because I heard great things about the curry restaurant on the top floor. Although getting there was ridiculous. Zero signposting, fairly slack attitude of staff giving directions from the shop floor and a lack of working elevators - it was definitely worth it once we got there. The food was the best I’ve had in a long time, it was value for money and the setting was lovely. Plenty of vegetarian options as you’d expect and lovely service.
Getting out of the building was the same hell as getting in, but I’d do it again for the food. Don’t give up, persevere and you’ll be rewarded !"
,,best place for shopping in Singapore !!,5.0,,"everything to buy is available under one roof
prices are very reasonable
watches, clothes, CD,s of the latest Hollywood blockbusters
are available, you name it they have it
you can change your money at the Mustafa Money Exchange
next door giving the best exchange rates
i never miss this shopping center whenever i am in Singapore
there is a food court downstairs where you can grab a bite
highly recommended"
,,Quality goods under one roof.,5.0,,"Awesome place to buy variety of quality goods under one roof. there are plenty of stores from cloth pin to foods, garments, cosmetics, fancy items, hardware, electronics, IT accessories, household items, fashion and many more.
good place, convenient and you can get your tax refunds for the goods which you bring back to your country."
,,One Stop Shopping,4.0,,"It's my coming for the n-th time because I'm too lazy to search for gifts to be brought home. You can find almost anything, from branded out-of-season items to some out-of-nowhere cosmetic brand. It's cheap for the branded item, but for common souvenirs, you can find cheaper price elsewhere."
,,interesting and busy,5.0,,"you can find your favorite indian products here! from top floor to basement... from clothing, textile.. to medicine to food.. you name it!. beneficial also for foreigners because they have a tax rebate booth at their basement. just make sure to wear comfortable clothing as the mall is a bit tight and busy."
,,Convenient and loaded with merchandise!,5.0,,"Open 24 hours, Mustafa centre has long been an iconic site in the Little India neighbourhood of Singapore.
The ground store had a range of products interesting among them being Casio and other watches, various costume jewellery and accessories including crystal bead bracelets, going further up the escalator, you find a floor full of goodies - cookies, chocolates, cocktail mixture, sweets, etc. On the ladies floor - there are saris galore. You could get lost amid all the racks of saris. In addition you find a range of underwear, socks, blouses, skirts, slacks and other garments.
The toy section which I did not access, however I hear had rubber versions of creepy crawlies that kids, especially little boys would like to have. For table and bed linen, spices, medicines, lotions, potions, cosmetics or hardware, you only have to name it to a staff member and you are directed to the relevant place.

If you want to grab a piece of hand luggage to throw in the extra luggage you have accumulated during your shopping sprees, here's the ideal place to choose from. I got a carry all this time, and on a different occasion bought a hand luggage with wheels on them.
Definitely a must see."
,,Value shopping,4.0,,Very good place for shopping in Singapore. It has a huge collection of products and cheap comparing other place of Singapore.
,,Very cheap! Open 24 hours. Practically sells everything! Definitely recommend.,4.0,,"It's very near to Farrer Park MTR rather than Little India. Or a long walk from Little India. We got off at Little India, explored the area then walked to the M Centre and got back on the MTR at Farrer Park. Ask anyone if you can't find it. Everyone will know! Very busy with multiple floors and super cheap selling anything and everything from the kitchen sink! Guess it is imported from India."
,,24 hour shopping plus food,4.0,,"The place is huge. It is crowded and chaotic but gives you everything that you are looking for under one roof. We shopped for some clothes, chocolates, cookies and few souvenirs from here. The best thing is - everyone knows where Mustafa center is, so it is very easy to reach. Plus there are food outlets across the street with some offering 24*7 food as well. So that was a big plus for us esp. since we are strict vegetarians."
,,24 hours shopping,4.0,,"its 24 hours open, and you can shop til you drop, a lot of food shops around and food are quite nice and affordable"
,,Crazy place for shopping,5.0,,"This is one crazy, crowded, chaotic place, but it has all things under one roof. You can buy perfumes, souvenirs, chocolates, luggage groceries, knick knacks and what not at Mustafa and its all properly sorted and labelled. Don't miss gold shopping, if prices are high in your country. The best, part its all GST free for tourists."
,,Pathetic customer service,1.0,,I have not seen customer service worse than that at Mustafa. The salesmen are more interested in chatting to each other rather than serve the customer.
,,everything is there,4.0,,"nice place, everything you need is there from souvenir, to toiletries, souvenirs, clothes, perfume and electronics, the place got a lot of nice indian food, and the best part is it is 24 hours in operation!"
,,Not like what i thought,3.0,,"Mostly people need to come here for shopping specially a perfume
but for me a price is not that cheap like i thought and to be honest
a grade of perfume not sure is europe grade or not
but have so many kind of things here if you wanna shopping
and for me all the price is normal that you can buy from any other place too."
,,Shopping mall,4.0,,"Mustafa center is a big shopping mall in little india area.Has everything inside (electronics,clothes,shoes,chocolates,etc)in good prices.Worth a visit if you want to shop some gifts."
,,The usual bustling store,5.0,,"As an Asian this place as a spectacular Ambience , and 24 hours shopping department store for one stop for any items make it best place for short time transitors Variety of brands and items you could spend hours in here and not realize"
,,Good Indian Food in Mustafa Centre,4.0,,Had the food at curry times located in mustafa centre a few times. Both veg and non vegetarian food are great. Expect to wait awhile for the food due to crowd but is well worth the wait!
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"If you want to shop then look no further then Mustafa. It's open 24/7 and stocks anything and everything that you may want to buy. Rates are cheaper than duty free, online sites as well as other stores. We mostly bought perfumes and chocolates - and found rates to be cheaper by at least 20-30% and if you caught a good offer than you could even save up to 50% like we did on Ferrari perfumes. But be prepared to spend a lot of time searching for the best deals as Mustafa is absolutely massive."
,,All u need in a roof,3.0,,"In the middle of town. If u drive yr own car, better be early cause parking is very limited & very crowded most of the time. Cheap designer perfumes, but not too much souvenirs. It opens 24hrs."
,,Plenty of Shops,3.0,,"Great to ""shop around"", to look at the various cheap deals.Plenty of eateries, from vegetarian to other Asean Cuisine."
,,Bad services,1.0,,"Bad experience with mustaffa watches staff.

Staff got kind of errant,he took down his watch and throw it on the table to show that scratches on watches is very common.

Deliberately tell you that service centre do polishing for watch case,when service centre do not provide any warranty servicing for the external.

Service here was treating you as a passing by customers only.
Do one time business enough,
don't need to come again.

Show less"
,,Open all hours,4.0,,"The clothing here is expensive and not really suitable for Westerners. However, the toiletries and perfumery was cheap. I brought a power pack and sd card which was inexpensive to Melbourne Australian prices. I exchanged money in the store which was handy. There are lots of taxis outside which makes traveling easier."
,,Just ok,2.0,,its just another big departmental store. not that well organized and price wise it doesn't have that much advantage. yet it's a place you need to visit atleast once.
,,Wide and unending selection,5.0,,"It has everything grocery,perfumes,toys,cloths,chocolate,gym equipment, electronics u just name it u ll get everything at cheap rate..its open 24×7..its situated at heart of singapore little india..staff is helpful..for the tourist if u keep invoice u can claim refund of tax from airport..try to avoid on weekend as too many local public come for shopping"
,,Shopping,3.0,,"This is a very large store which sells lots of things including souvieniers on the second floor, we didnt think the items were very cheap and found better value over the road in the small shops or in Chinatown."
,,Cheap supermarket,5.0,,24 hour big supermarket in singapore...a big must place to visit in singapore...very very cheap price compared to indonesian mall...
,,for people from dubai this is a let down,3.0,,"in dubai we have the best of shopping malls - and so mustapha is a definite NO NO for us- Mustapha is operated by ex-indian muslims from tamilnadu - who are now naturalised singaporeans- the shopping centre is buzzing - with goods from all over the world but the ambience is so middle-class- budget-type- a similar type of outlet-chain is in dubai called LULU also run by indian muslim NRis from south india - but the lulu chain is far superior in all matters- LULU is more clean, more hygienic, more sophisticated ..."
,,"Great Place, Open 24 Hours",4.0,,"If you’ve been in Singapore awhile you will have heard of Mustafa’s. This is the 24-hour shopping complex in Little India.
If you are into a bit of a treasure hunt, or just looking for any of them types of different mango’s, they’ve got ‘em.
It may seem a bit cluttered, but I like the vibe of the store. Great if you want to go shopping late at night (or early in the morning)"
,,Know what to expect,3.0,,"I came here thinking that I would be able to find a huge store full of Indian products (spices, handicrafts, etc). They do carry things from India, but not any more than the grocery stores in the area. The Mustafa Center is just a discount department store and grocery store. It is more for locals than for tourists."
,,Chocolates,4.0,,"Since we stayed in farrer park area, Mustafa Centre was one of the place that we must visited since we always bought chocolates there. The kids just loved to do the shopping and picked their favorite chocolates that weren't existed in our country.We went there on weekend so the cashier line was a bit long and the space for queue was too narrow."
,,Claims to have the best rates in singapore,1.0,,"They flat out lie and can't even meet to a simple request of changing for smaller notes. Claims to be the best rate in singapore. My incident happened when i changed 800 SGD To TBH
Rate On-line was 24.24 but i got only 24 as they claimed it was best in the country.

Passing another money changer in jurong point. The rate was 24.11

Don't go there. Dont get tricked by experienced conman."
,,all you need is there,4.0,,You can find all your needs in one place. It is huge so it takes a long time to find your needs. Just before entrance i had to get my backpack cable tied. Most of time it is crowded there so prevent weekends.
,,Short change twice on two occasions,1.0,,"I have visited here on two occasions, and on both occasions by Bill total was both exceeding $150, however an additional $50had been added on to one of the products..... I don't believe this to be a coincidence. I am an expat. Expats beware. Do not trust the people in Mustafa, always be on your guard at night."
,,It was an ok experience,3.0,,"1. The only 24 hours shopping mall in Singapore.
2. Always crowded in the daytime but it is safe to shop early in the mornings 12am-ish.
3. Easy to get a taxi outside the building.
4. The area is filled with indian food
5. Toilets in mustafa centre is terrible and dirty! Please refrain from going to the toilets.
6. The items there is cheaper than most places.
7. They sell almost the same item in different sections just to make the place look full and fully stocked. That makes it quite difficult to move around and especially with a stroller!"
,,A to Z store in my opinion,5.0,,Mustafa Centre has each and every thing any one can think. House hold Grocery Electronic Sports equipments Stationary Clothing Moreover they have best currency exchanger with best rate with in Singapore. 24 hrs facility. All type of restaurants are in front of it.
,,Lots to choose from,3.0,,Plenty of floors and lots of merchandise. And open 24 hours. Best things for us was the Indian spices and foods available.
,,Fire Trap,2.0,,"Mustafa's has an enormous range of products, particularly food products from the sub-continent. Prices generally cheaper than supermarkets in Singapore. However, the huge problem is the very restricted space, narrow aisles crammed with shopping trolleys, and worse, big trolleys being pushed around by staff to stock the shelves. Definitely do not go with small children they may suffer injuries or get lost in the maze. Bathrooms are poorly maintained, lifts often break down. Although they get pulled up occasionally by the authorities the building remains a fire trap."
,,Everything you didnt know you needed,4.0,,"From chocolates to toiletries, this is the place to stock up on value deals. Watch our for brand name goods, check before you buy. Found great deals for sweets, medical needs, supplements, souvenirs and sports goods."
,,Best place where you can find anything you need,5.0,,a very good place. It is huge and has high to low quality products . Staff are very friendly. Overall good place. Reasonable price
,,Worst Place in SIngapore,1.0,,"Mustafa Centre is one of the worst places i have visited in Singapore. It is a huge shopping mall which has everything that you will need, however the worst quality and prices dont match the quality. The facilities cannot be used as it was so dirty. Yes the place is said to be open all night however the staff is very less. Please do not go to this place."
,,Everything you want under 1 roof,2.0,,"They have a huge variety but mostly low to mid quality stuff and the prices are not the cheapest. Even for the Chinese knick knacks, a store in a more upmarket mall near my hotel had better things at cheaper prices. The place is not kept very clean and some items appear repackaged without some essential parts like the curlers that were missing the lotion. Finally a heating pad I brought home does not work. The time and money I would spend returning it is simply not worth it.

Upside is that it is open 24 hours; the money changer offers very good rates with the lowest spreads I have seen."
,,Huge,4.0,,"It has everything yes, but its also just one big store. it's great for the locals but its narrow and a bit of a nightmare to navigate."
,,Mustafa Mall,5.0,,"it is perfect shopping destination for all of you, you get all you want at the best price. by far it is the biggest departmental store i have ever seen."
,,Everything under one roof,5.0,,"If you can think of buying it, you will most likely find it here. It has everything you want and never knew you wanted. Its pretty cheap. I read on here the staff were rude but that wasn't the case for me, they were helpful. I would say watch out for trolleys from other shoppers and staff replenishing stock! It is open 24hrs but go early to beat the crowds"
,,Great prices and variety,5.0,,"They have huge collections of everything.
Either you want currency exchange, or watches, electronics or daily grocery they have everything.
They are quite popular both with travellers and locals. Prices are much lower than other parts of Singapore.

Best part is they are open 24x7.

They have good take away food outlet also which serves quick bites and quite popular for late night dining.

On roof top there is a fine dining restaurant too."
,,A curiosity to see,4.0,,"A huge department store mixed with a bazaar, giving a result somehow unique.
Be patient, don’t be afraid of the crowd and rubbing shoulders with everyone to walk through, and take the time to explore the different levels.
You should find there anything and everything you need.
Soap, perfume, food (the quantity of spices available is amazing!), tools, kitchen utensils, clothing, sports good, watch, medicine etc
I would not go shopping there everyday but for sure for some specific products it is The place."
,,"Generally low prices, keep expectations low",4.0,,"They are known for low prices on anything one may want - soap to TV, groceries to electronics, gold to snacks, tourist trinkets to household stuff. Spread over at least two buildings and multiple floors, it's easy to wander if not familiar with layout. But expect disorganized shelves, sketchy labeling, and indifferent customer service."
,,Great shopping experience,5.0,,"A huge mall selleing almost everything, from home furniture and accessories to spices, jewels and cloths. Open 24h. Better to shop overnight since it is very crowded during the day"
,,Close to Little India,4.0,,Mustafa center is very close to little india. outside the shopping center indian restaurants are widely available. wonderful place to hand around. products are not that cheap.
,,Found the watch that i wanted in this shop,5.0,,"My first travel to this place in March was disappointing because I was looking to just shop any reasonable items in Singapore. This shop has everything which you may be looking all over the world or imagine and racks and racks of anything. But on our first visit we came back disappointed after 4 hour.

This time when I visited again in June but I wanted a particular watch, I just went to the watch section and there I found choice in the watch that I wanted which I did not find in my hometown Vadodara. I was out in half an hour but happy at my acquisition.

So go to Mustafa with your target buy in mind and you will be more than happy with the variety."
,,Fun cultural experience in Little India,5.0,,"I went here, not because I needed to buy something, but because I had heard people raving about this place. And it didn't disappoint. They carry just about anything you might need from groceries to toiletries, clothes, electronics, and even gold! The place was bustling on a Saturday afternoon. Another reason to go inside is to use the bathrooms and enjoy some AC after walking around in Little India/Singapore heat."
,,Mustafa Centre Shopping,5.0,,All kinds of products available. Product prices fixed. Available in different floors. Quality ensured.
,,One stop shop for almost everything you need,4.0,,"Visited Mustafa Centre after listening and reading quite a few good things about the shop and wasn't disappointed. The store is indeed huge with a lot of stuff, almost anything you can think of. However, the prices aren't exactly lower than you'd find elsewhere. Also, its popularity means you're more often than not stuck in a huge queue at billing counter, so be ready for that."
,,Not worth it,1.0,,"We visited Mustafa Centre with a lot of expectations after reading reviews and hearing about it from people who have visited Singapore in the past, however I was disappointed after entering as the prices are pretty much the same as Walmart and Metro in India or other countries. It’s just a huge supermarket with groceries, toiletries, crockery, electronics medical supplies, luggage etc. Nothing extraordinary or special about it, it used to be the only such about 15 or more years ago, but in current times, with so many options, it’s quite outdated. The staff is also quite disinterested and extremely rude, at gate no 5 and gate no 2, we politely enquired with the staff as to what was there inside each gate so we could choose where to do, since there was no information written outside. But neither of them were interested to offer any assistance! We had the best 4 days in Singapore, Singaporean nationals are friendly and sweet people who were always happy to answer our questions and we had some very interesting conversations with the locals and also made good friends. But it is really sad that Indians living here are so rude, inhospitable and behave as if they are doing us a favour by talking to us. The last four days have been extremely memorable except for this below average experience at Mustafa."
,,One stop shopping for almost everything,5.0,,"24 hour shopping where you can almost find anything you need. Ranging from electrical, to groceries, videos, electronics, sports equipment. I bought my punching bag here too."
,,Convenient and worth the price,4.0,,"Good shopping place as you can get A-Z things here, price is reasonable. Spend more than 2 hours here, huge shopping place, from branded stuff to grocery all had it here."
,,An amazing experience - the Macy’s of Singapore,5.0,,"This shopping center with the well named title has everything you need. Situated in Little India Singapore, it is like Macy’s in Manhattan whereby it takes up a couple of street blocks and is at least 7 storeys. It has every item you could ever wish for in a western dept store and price wise it isn’t too bad. Had an absolute ball shopping and you definitely need a few hours at the very least. I recommend you visit this centre when in town and be prepared to be surprised by the stock levels and variety. The staff were excellent and knowledgeable and very friendly. Not to be missed."
,,Love shopping? This is the place!,5.0,,"Oh I spent almost 200S$ just for the chocolates and other stuff. Hahaha. They have the lowest price I've even seen. I hoard lots of chocolates. LOL. If you have a sweet, definitely DO NOT miss this place. Hahaha. Other gadgets are also available here. We've bought PS4 with 3 games just for 459S$. Don't forget to get your gst refund. ;)"
,,24 hrs Seamless Shopping in Singapore,5.0,,"You can walk into Mustafa Shopping Centre any time of the day for what ever needs u have but do avoid the Saturday & Sunday crowds.
The best time to be there is in the wee hours of the night...9.30 pm to 10 am
You can opt to dine on level four at the restaurant there.The dishes are good and will not hurt your pocket.

Do check it out"
,,"Busy, busy, busy",1.0,,"24 hour shopping place in Little India, selling everything under the sun. Biscuits and sweets being the big sellers as far as I can tell.

Very crowded during the day. If you are concerned about your personal space, do not come here. I couldn’t wait to get out of there once I got in. If you come with a bag you will need to check it in prior to entering. Just stay away from here would be my recommendation."
,,Nice Place,4.0,,Very nice place for visit. You will find variety and reasonable price. Quality for products. Nice staff.
,,Check this place before you buy somewhere else,5.0,,"Everytime I came to Singapore, I always come to Mustafe, usually to buy lots of confectioneries. Each time they have discount and promos, not all of them but several products. But please check the expiration date before you buy them. Since Mustafa is open 24 hours, so it's the place for last minute shopping. They have everything, I literally mean everything and so huge! You can get lost in here, like me"
,,Not to my standard,2.0,,May be it's good shopping mall for others but for me it's not to my standard. The place is very messy and conjucted. If you ask for staff to help they just simply walk away. I will never ever go there again.
,,What a place!,4.0,,"Not sure where to start! Massive. Quite chaotic. Messy. No one quite knows where things are. You name it, they have it. Very reasonably priced. How on earth do they manage a precise inventory and a clear record of all the products available and sold, is anyone’s guess!"
,,What a place.... Fulfill are your shipping needs.,5.0,,In Singapore and want to shop everything under one roof..... Mustafa is theee place. Nothing more to say. Don't miss the rooftop cafe for some tasty Indian food after trying shopping. Enjoy.
,,Plastic Nightmare,2.0,,"Yes, it was full of everything you might need on a trip and much more! And it's apparently open round the clock.

But the security staff were a bit too aggressive. The second time I went there I was refused entry on the grounds of my having a small back pack on my shoulder, though this in fact was my shopping bag and contained my wallet. I was directed to a ""desk"" outside where I could see someone else having their backpack ""secured"" with ties before they were allowed entry. Rather then being subjected to the same, I left my companion outside with my bag. (I did try to tell the security guard about presumption of innocence.)

In addition, the worst thing was the MASSIVE use of thick white plastic bags by the cashiers for encasing customers' purchases. These were used in abundance, often being only partially filled before another one was started. Each was tied with a plastic tie as well. There seemed to be absolutely no awareness of the environmental impact and sheer wastefulness of this."
,,Full of product,3.0,,I don’t think they could fit much more in the store! Narrow aisles and everything you can think of. However pricing doesn’t seem any cheaper. Personally don’t think the trip would be worth it if you were just coming to the area for shopping.
,,Everytime you need Everything is here,4.0,,"it sell everything
open 24 hours
very huge and complete
you can here everytime you want when you need buy souvenir or gift
when i visit singapore, i usually here at midnight because I will visit other place or market during the day and I'll give up my bedtime to come here, it also not too crowded at midnight."
,,something for everyone,4.0,,"“if you can’t find it in mustafa, you can’t find it anywhere else” always something to buy whenever I visit. security is pretty tight as they make sure your bags are fastened before you enter."
,,Stop 82 singapore,4.0,,I have visited mustafa center for some shopping and accidently came across this shop called stop 82 singapore. I should say at first i thought maybe some normal shop selling basic stuffs but when i went inside i was surprise to find a lot of good quality clothing and at very reasonable price.was a good experience surely will visit again.i bought a pair of jeans and a leather shoe i am using regularly quality is very good.
,,Open 24 hours,4.0,,"This shopping centre is huge and they sell everything. I mean E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G. Clothing-wise, don't expect fashion show style, but more like the cheaper styles with the cheap prices. Open 24 hours."
,,Shopping !!!,5.0,,Every time come Singapore i also shopping here . This place very big . Can find anything good at here .Hope come again soon 😊😊😊
,,24 hour shopping at Mustafa Singapore,4.0,,"A really amazing experience... it’s amazing how there are so many choices just for a single item...things are not too neatly organized... prices are reasonable and for those who love to browse around, they can easily spend hours there without feeling bored. However, some staff are not overly friendly and helpful. Payment can be a nightmare depending on the time of day.

Surrounding area is vibrant n lively. Many places to eat ... there is a small mall nearby .."
,,You can find everything you can think of!,4.0,,You can get everything here with a good price. Stuff from here is quite cheaper than another place I went there at midnight but still had a lot of people buying stuff This place was quite packed and some part was a bit dirty too
,,Shopping,4.0,,"A series of interconnected shops host the centre. You get to see the varieties of Indian foods and Spices, green groceries, household goods and appliances."
,,Its a Big Mall with 1000's of people!,3.0,,"I read about this place as being one of the places to go to if in Singapore. I dont really know why. Its a big mall with everything and anything for sale. It is very busy, we did not go till after 10pm (it is open 24hrs), and there were 1000's of people everywhere. It is difficult to walk through the narrow aisles.
I suppose its worth a visit, but in my opinion, its nothing special."
,,Everything Under One Roof,4.0,,This is one place where I love to go because you can get almost everything that you need here. The prices are reasonable and it is very easily accessible by public transport too. This place can be crowded over the weekends and you can see loads of foreign workers doing their shopping here. You will not be disappointed.
,,Mustafa,4.0,,Everything under one roof went there looking for a very big bag to put a box of a massage chair back and was not disappointed. I found the bag after I had gone to a lot of malls in Singapore. Most of the parts in the store are a bit dusty though
,,One Stop Shop,4.0,,"Shop is a misnomer..Mustafa Centre in Little India is an one stop Shopping Mall...for all items...I bought Vegetables, Fruits, Groceries regularly..it is open 24X7...Very crowded in the evenings & on weekends..I used to go early morning for my Shopping...Value for Money & a must visit Shopping Mall."
,,Mustafa- A must Go,4.0,,Mustafa centre in Singapore is surely a place to be visited to pick some economical gifts to be given back at home after visit to Singapore. The staff are friendly & good choices available. Only issue is that its too crowded at evening times.
,,First Place to visit at Singapore,4.0,,"After reaching Singapore this should be the first place to visit to purchase all essentials which you may require during stay. Water which is very expensive at almost every destination is available here at cheapest rates. Even at the currency conversion counter, you will get the best deal."
,,Nice shopping mall,4.0,,Went to mustafa centre but felt the prices of clothes a bit on higher side as compared to the outlets in little india. However the advantage is that one can get everything from medicines to grocery and fashion accessories under one roof that too with no closing time.
,,Mustafa Centre!!,2.0,,"Yes, in this multi level place you can look for anything and everything. Staff not very helpful. Our hotel was a short distance from this place, so could see it wad quiet crowded during the evening, ok during day time. Cramped up place, prices are no less, in fact felt that places like China town or Bugis street were better in terms of pricing."
,,Default stop for souvenirs,4.0,,"I know there are other places where you can get your souvenirs for a much cheaper price but this place carry almost everything you dont have to move to find what you're looking for. From chocolates, shirts, condiments, jewleries, dry goods and whatnot. It is really crowded all the time,i havent been here without the place filled to the brim so bringing a kid might be uncomfortable. Just make sure to know what you want beforehand so you dont waste your time looking around"
,,A huge shopping mall,4.0,,"A visit to Singapore is incomplete without visiting the super famous Mustafa center.
Open 24 hours, its a must visit place for all the shoppers out there. From daily household items to unique products, they have it all. Good food down the street after shopping here is a must to do.
Though crowded most of the times, but it's a good experience if you have ample free time when in Singapore."
,,Crowded but worth it!!!,4.0,,"The best time to visit Mustafa is late at night when it’s less crowded giving one time to shop at leisure. We made 2 visits to Mustafa but it was only the second visit late at night which resulted in shopping to our hearts content. Good bargains, quality products, but be prepared to spend time in searching for the good deals."
,,Mustafa Centre - Singapore,3.0,,"As we were residing in the Park Royal Hotel, Mustafa Centre was just behind the hotel and not even a two minutes.

You name a tiniest thing or wanna change currency,Mustafa Centre has everything & is open 24hours.

From household grocery to cosmetics, perfumes to clothes or cafe to eletronics, anything & everything is available under 1 roof......even Gold Jewellery

Perfumes here are cheaper than the airport duty free.

Personally I did not like this place !"
,,I love the Mustafa Centre,5.0,,"I have just read some bad reviews, but I think those people had different expectations. Mustafa's is HUGE, and mostly crowded but there are some excellent buys to be had. And it really is a bit of an experience - to there, but don't expect an up market mall or you will be sadly disappointed. They sell just SO MUCH STUFF, it's fun just browsing around."
,,Anything and everything under one roof,4.0,,"Mustafa is huge, at times overwhelming, and is well known for being the 24-hour everything-in-one place with really bad parking space.

Granted, if you know what you need, don't need the counter help, and just need to get the items, your trip to Mustafa will be fairly fast. The staff there can point you to where your items are, but not all the details of the item unless they work behind the counter. Some things here are cheaper than usual, but not everything.

That being said, Mustafa is my go-to for some daily necessities and random items I need in a pinch. Being in Little India, the assortment of teas is great for me and I get my fix of spice tea there often."
,,A true one stop shopping place !,4.0,,"I have been to multiple locations and visited malls , but I assure you this mall will get one anything ever you thought or dream to buy or you would need to live on this earth.

Specifically for Indians , this is a place you will get all kind of spices and Indian stuff you get in India . Can make you family feel like India in little India."
,,Super super shop,4.0,,"Everything is available in this shop! Whatever is in your wish list, you will find here. Prices are also in the lower side. When it comes about quality, I found it is good considering the ~10 items I bought except for the perfume. I am skeptical about the quality/authenticity of the perfume. I was there on a weekday around 11 AM and the place was less crowded. Happy shopping!"
,,Very disappointing,2.0,,"Large and air conditioned however, found staff rude and not knowledgeable about their products. Pricing was not cheap apart from some electronics and pharmacy supplies. Would not recommend."
,,A shopping center with almost everything!,4.0,,"The shopping complex is huge, good value for money and offers a host of items that you'll be getting under one roof."
,,Little India,5.0,,"Decided we would check this place out, some things were quite reasonable but you need to know prices as not everything is cheap. Good for a gander!"
,,A multilevel shopping centre,4.0,,On my trip to Singapore I visited Mustafa Centre which is a multilevel shopping center and had a wonderful experience of shopping. If your going to Singapore go to this shopping center which I find reasonable in price and has everything that you think of buying.
,,Mustafa Shopping Center,5.0,,"Mustafa Shopping Mall is very Bis spread in 6 Floors.Eveey this from Cloth to Home Appliances, Grocery, Electronics, Electrical , Vegetables etc are available at reasonable prices. Most amazing is Jewellery section. No of deigns of all the jewellery items are available. All the items are available in good quantity. Indian grocery items are available in good varieties."
,,Cheap souvenirs,5.0,,"You can buy many souvenirs at cheap price in there. There are many stores also provide snacks here, local food and snack provided also"
,,Did not appeal,3.0,,"We visited here on a whim after an aborted attempt at the Land Transport Gallery (see my other review). The only real stuff of interest to us was the Electronics/Technology/Electrical section in the basement. Wasn't really in the market for anything but even if I were, price comparisons to retail in Australia didn't really seem to make anything a bargain, and you've also got the added issue of warranty claims if needed. For everything else like peripherals and USB gadgetry, unless you specifically needed something in Singapore I would wait until I got home and order it off Ebay (with a very good chance it'll probably get posted to you from here anyway!)"
,,average,3.0,,"if you know what you want then its a good place. but prices are not cheap. now prices at par with other shopping centers, its very crowed."
,,Low Prices!,4.0,,The prices are low for groceries! We bought toothpaste and tea bags there. The center is large and busy. Mustafa offers wholesale prices. Our backpack was allowed into Mustafa but they locked our zipper. They cut the plastic zipper on the way out.
,,Not what I expected...,3.0,,"I had heard about the Mustafa centre, and convinced husband to go by telling him it was like a big 'reject shop' (Australian's will understand).
Well I was wrong. It is a tightly packed shop of everything imaginable. Look we didn't get through all of it. We bought a few things, nothing very cheap but quality seems ok.
For souvenirs at cheap prices I would go to the small shops in little india, although I didn't have a good look at the prices here.
We got the best rate on foreign currency exchange here (opposite)."
,,Big but cramped. too many items not arranged in a systematic way.,3.0,,I am not impressed. only good point is location Little India is easily accessible. May be individual preference vary.
,,All in one store,4.0,,"If you have forgotten to carry something from your home - do not worry this is the place to get all those stuffs. A massive massive departmental store open 24*7 and all types of things available to eat, wear, carry."
,,Everything-you-can-imagine shop,4.0,,"If MacGyver transforms into a shop, this could be it. Selling things from shaver to meat and also football jersey, you can always get what you want here. The aisle, however, is small. Expect bumping into others as you wander this place.

Best place to find some luggage. Price so good, even you still can redeem GST if it’s more than 100SGD."
,,24hour shopping,4.0,,Anytime you could visit the place. Bought perfume and it is a good bargain. 2 inyercomnect buildings with lots of selection. If you can not sleep on the middle of the night then this olace is for you to spend time.
,,Gillette blades do not shave,2.0,,"On a recent trip to Singapore, we went to Mustafa as usual and did some shopping. I picked up 2 packets 8 each of Gillette Mach Turbo blades and they do not work on the first shave. What a waste of money about SGD 40. I did not expect this at Mustafa."
,,People's super market,5.0,,It's a super huge market with all the things in the world. It's cheap as well considering Singapore culture and lifestyle It's a must go place. Only thing which needs improvement is the proper labeling of where to find products and lacks of human help
,,Mustafaar is the bazaar of Singapaar,4.0,,"An unique shopping experience in Singapore: sprawling several blocks and floors, this 24-7, never-closed store sells everything: food (including fresh produce), non-food household products, electronics, jewellery (lots of 24K gold and even diamonds), clothing, pharmaceuticals and toiletries; multiple brands from unknown to famous (you will not find Rimowa but you may find Reemova); etc. It may look chaotic, but this is not a wet market - you cannot bargain! Don’t neglect the rooftop restaurant, simply named “Kebabs n Curries, Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian”; if you don’t mind the plebeian décor, it serves one of the most varied and succulent South Asian food in Singapore - even Chinese dishes prepared with Indian spices (called Indo-Chinese here, but it ain’t Vietnamese, Khmer or Lao)."
,,"Good place for pasalubong,",5.0,,"just 7 mins walk from my hostel. very wide variety of display ... was able to hoard lots of perfume, sprays, chocolate, creams... good luck to my baggage...i will surely be back here."
,,Good place for shopping,4.0,,"This is in Little India, a minute away from Farrer Park MRT station. You get lot of variety here, everything from clothes, souveniours to even electronics. Worth visiting here.
Closest competition to this is Chinatown, which I felt gave things at an even cheaper rate (as you can't bargain here)"
,,One room evening,4.0,,"Best for shopping. Very reasonable prices, 24 hours open lots of variety. But avoid in weekend its over crowded especially old section."
,,Iconic Departmental Store including a Travel Service,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre on Little India Street is a huge Departmental store with many entrances. They deal in almost all items from electronics, jewellery, white goods, pharma products to groceries that a household needs and their prices are competitive. In first visit the place looks like a maze or labyrinth because of of inter-twinned and inter- connected network of passages with narrow aisles jam packed with all types of products. You might need to visit a couple of times to explore the whole shop as there is just so much to browse through and buy! There is a travel section where one can apply for visa to countries like Malaysia and China."
,,Don't bother,2.0,,"Was very disappointed to make the effort to visit here but found the mall full of too much stuff. Couldn't be bothered trying to sift though the hoards of items, as most prices didn't seem any cheaper than a well presented store."
,,Shopping day,4.0,,"I brought my Brother in law from US there We end up spending 4 hours there shopping. You can buy almost anything there. Huge store. We nearly got lost.

Price is cheaper for most things and you can even find things that you normally do not see...I got a fan/light/radio in one really cool"
,,busy market,4.0,,"it look like supermarket , with ac for it convenience. there is 2 building , in front of them , a lot of restaurant selling vegetarian food . you can find almost everything you need here"
,,Find just about anything here,4.0,,Well worth a visit if you're looking for items at a reasonable price but make sure to look around. Enormous department store type shopping complex. bit over crowded on weekends but not a problem.
,,Highly overrated,3.0,,"One of the things that people tell you is that you must shop at Mustafa when you go to Singapore. After doing that this time, I would highly recommend that you do not do this. It is just a large general store that has pretty much everything but at prices maybe 5% cheaper than other places. The experience leaves a lot and you do not want to enter that place. Best to avoid unless you plan to shop a huge amount and looking for cheap nick knacks."
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"If you want something, need something, or can’t find something, then this is the place to go! Huge shopping centre over lots of floors......you could get lost in here! There is the odd bargain to be found if you dig deep. Well worth a visit even if you just window shop!
Open 24 hours.....early morning half the staff are asleep but you will still find someone to serve you!"
,,Huge market with practically everything under the sun,4.0,,"Mustafa is a humongous market that I suspect would take at least a week to cover from top to bottom. Here you can find practically anything imported from all corners of the world. It is easy to get lost inside, and there are not a lot of signs to point you in the right direction, so you would have to ask. The array of merchandise here is stunning, as are the number of shoppers. It seems like half of Singapore is shopping there at the same time!"
,,What do you wish to buy?,4.0,,"This mega shopping centre right in the middle of Little India has everything a shopper requires right from groceries, electronics, apparel , luggage ware, footwear, money changers, cafe, visa and travel etc. Prices are reasonable if not slightly cheaper than elsewhere.
This place is perennially crowded; especially on weekends and holidays. It is a popular hangout spot for the hundreds of foreign workers in Singapore."
,,So many things under one roof,4.0,,"This centre is massive and there are various things under one roof ,a foreign exchange too,great if looking for pretty much everything"
,,Good items are located,4.0,,"On our first day in Singapore, this is the first area / centre we went. Aside from good money changers here, this mall is good enough to buy items for daily living. Items are affordable and quality wise. As i have seen, all sellers are Indians and they are nice. You can even have a discount on selected items and sellers. From clothing, household items, gadgets and others."
,,full of variety!,5.0,,"On weekends , it is jampacked , but you will find from every little thing to large electronic goods , various brands of cosmetics , fashionable dresses from cheap rates to expensive , must visit place if you are staying near serangoon road , and if you step out you will find street market ."
,,Find everything here!,4.0,,"I know if we needed to find something, this would be the best place to find it. Good place to your souvenir. A lot of candies, cookies, chocolate etc."
,,Great Shopping Experience,4.0,,"This is a must-visit place if you are in Singapore and you are a big fan of chocolates, sweets and everything nice. The chocolates are sold at dirt-cheap prices and there is a large variety to choose from. I found some of my childhood favorites that were no longer available in Malaysia so I was really excited. However, do take note that it opens 24 hours and there is always a large crowd so its not really advisable to bring along your young children."
,,Extremely Rude Staff worst customer service,1.0,,"As a group of four we were recommended to visit the Mustafa Centre by our hotel, and on arrival we were totally shocked at the rudeness of not just one staff member but all staff members. From the moment we walked in we were made to feel like we were western scum and they were not one bit interested to help when we asked for assistance. This was the worst customer service experience we have ever experienced and I would not at all recommend to visit this disgusting place at all. Thank goodness we have do not have this disrespect to tourists in Australia"
,,Everything is There,4.0,,"A 24-hour shopping center available for you. If you’re looking for watches, electronics, perfumes, toiletries, over-the-counter meds and sweets/candies, this place offers those with very convenient pricing."
,,Obsessed!,5.0,,"From the moment I stepped into the Mustafa Centre for the first time last Saturday, I was hooked!

It is a shopping mecca for locals and travelers alike. It’s huge and exciting!

I was lucky enough to have someone recommend I visit Mustafa before I traveled to Singapore - they know I love to shop! I made a beeline for the megastore on Day 1 of my trip. My husband and kids left me to it because they knew I’d be in there for a long while.

Is there nothing this place doesn’t sell? They even stocked Vegemite! Fresh food, pharmaceuticals, beauty products, jewellery, electrical, handbags and EVERYTHING in between! All prices are the best in Singapore.

I made sure to get back to Mustafa one more time on the last day of our 5-day Singapore holiday.

Now I’m home, I miss Mustafa and dream of getting back there one day."
,,Wonderful Shopping,5.0,,Everything you need under one roof available here right from a sewing needle to Bicycles. Simply enjoyable shopping and you always come back with more than what you have decided to shop.
,,Fully loaded shopping centre,3.0,,"Fully loaded shopping center, clothes to Gold..electronics to Groceries..but when you go first time u will be fully confused where I entered and where I am exiting. Searching for something is a big task. Will be good if they maintain a bit sorted order of goods and sign boards meaningfully for convenience of buyers."
,,everything under one roof,4.0,,"choose your timing of visit wisely, i usually come in the morning before 11am or at night after 10pm to avoid crowds. it can get quite squeezy during the day \and weekends. but having said that, this is the place to rely on when u need to get stuff that you cant find at a nearby supermarket."
,,Electronics,5.0,,"We were looking for some wellpriced electronics and were qurious if we could find some here. We were suprised how well orginazed this mall although it was so big. All the floors were stuffed with all kinds of things, but well organized and good signs. We found what we wanted and paid less than we would have in another store."
,,Quirky Aladdin's Cave,4.0,,"In some regards a visit to this incredible emporium could be said to be required on any tourist's Singapore itinerary. High end to low end, it's all here. Our first experience - at 9.30 pm on Easter Saturday - was perhaps ill-advised as it was heaving. My rucksack was cable-tied shut just before entering and the tie was cut on exiting. We bought a couple of things including two very smart and sturdy suitcases for 65 DS or just over £35 at prevailing exchange rates. We also looked at very impressively-priced clothing. We went back at 10.00 am the following morning and found a much more sedate shop-floor and being able to breathe was a welcome change. I bought more clothing but was very put off when I tried to purchase a telephoto lens for my Sony camera which I saw with a 298 dollar price-tag the previous evening. I hadn't seen the ""PWP"" letters on the price tag which means Price with Purchase. The price without purchase was 599 dollars. I took myself off to Chinatown where I got that lens, plus a wide-angle and macro lens and filter, for less money (540 dollars). That aside, if you want a unique experience and fancy a bargain, make some time to visit Mustafa!"
,,"Anything, anytime",4.0,,"You can buy whatever you want from here. Most of the things that came to yourind, will most probably be available. Ranging from sports to electronic, to food and etc. Places is most of the time crowded. So, i wil suggest to go after 11pm. It's be easier to walk around and choose your stuff. Definitely will recommend of you wish to buy souvenirs."
,,ONE STOP FOR SHOPPING and DAILY NEEDS !!!!!,5.0,,"Located in Little India, a single stop point for all the Shoppers paradise and daily needs. Spread over 2 basement, ground and 4 floors with 8 entry and exit points, it makes this mall a single largest retail for shopping from pin to all electronics and food items.

A highly recommended place for all tourist for their shopping needs and a must visit in Singapore."
,,Best Supermarket at Little India,5.0,,"One of my favorite go to places to run my errands. You can virtually shop til you drop there, provided you know where to find what you want. There are lots of vegan food options and it's one of the cheapest in town as well. Another thing that I would visit is the currency exchange counter - I would normally get my currency exchanged there before I travel, as the rates are good!"
,,One stop shopping,3.0,,Is a nice place to shop where you can get almost everything you need. Only thing the place is cramp and crowded. Not all things are cheaper than other shops. Is a 24 hrs shopping centre and that is one benefit.
,,Everything Under One Roof,4.0,,"This is the place to go if you need to do some last-minute shopping. It is opened 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

They have everything from groceries to electronics to clothes to footwear. They even have a post office and cafeteria inside the premises!"
,,one stop shopping for everything. too cluttered inside. Was not too impressed too much,3.0,,"After lunch, we headed back towards our hotel but not before stopping by the iconic department store Mustafa Centre. I had heard a lot about this department store from anyone who has ever visited Singapore but frankly was a little underwhelmed. I mean yes it is very big and sells everything imaginable under the same roof (from groceries to souvenirs, apparel, electronics, gold, currency exchange and many more). However, I felt the store to be too cluttered with very narrow aisles. We ended up buying some souvenir chocolates for gifts back home."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Nice atmosphere for shopping. This is a round the clock shopping center. So, you dont need to worry about closing times. This is a rush place 24/7. you will not be able to tell whether its a day or night if you once enter the mall. Also, a lot of south indian and Bangladeshi restaurants are there to enjoy."
,,Best supermarket in Singapore with reasonable price,4.0,,"I've shopped across various malls and supermarkets in Singapore, I concluded that Mustafa is the best of all in terms of varieties, and pricing, best of all it's open all night, and multiple counters, no much waiting."
,,You have to see it to believe it,4.0,,"Quick tip, best time to go there is weekdays and as early as possible.
For the mother of god, don't go there on a Sunday at 6pm like yours truly.....
This place is fun, we didn't go there to shop, we went to see it but ended up leaving with 8 bags.
You can buy literally anything from toothpaste to gold.
I was amazed how much gold they had for sale there, it wasn't of high quality and it was made out of soft 22k gold, but it cheap!!!
You can look like Mr. T for not more than $5k, I'm not kidding!

Many locals go there to buy food (but not on weekends).

Prices, I don't know really, everything appeared to be cheap but there were quite a few items of questionable authenticity. Don't expect to find high end brands here.
Again, if you want to have some fun and perhaps pick up something like a souvenir, this can be a cool place.
Electronics, you can buy the latest MacBook Pro and 10m away you can find remnants of 20th century tech. Amazing

Give it a go.

Cheers"
,,Everything you will need,5.0,,Whatever you need they have it. The other bonus is they are open 24/7 it’s soooo convenient that you can shop anytime when you are free ! They have all items under one roof. The prices are competitive so do compare outside.
,,Mustafa Centre,4.0,,"I first visited Mustafa Centre in 2005, and there and than I decided and made up my mind that I will never visit this vicinity again. So much cleaninness in Singapore and so much dirt in the vicinity of Mustafa Centre.

But now in 2018, somehow I planned a visit to Mustafa Centre, and here I am, really happy to see the area. Too crowded but I surely witnessed, the famous Singaporian discipline. Food over here is considerably cheap. Street food restaurant were great. And last not least visit to Mustafa Centre was great, a great place for shopping. Pricing is competitive.

Here, do eat lots of paratha, Chai, Channa Chaat, mithai and drink lot of Coconut."
,,Visit to Mustafa,2.0,,"All under one roof. 24 hour shopping. Staff are not friendly. We spoke to a few it looks like they r angry with the management and taking it out on customers.

Did good shopping butvwhen we returned to SL foundnout some stuff were of substandard. Samsung earphones for J7, phillips battety for camera. Very sad..very very poor quality earphones.

Dont get cheated. Vety unprofessional staff"
,,24 hour local grocery mall,4.0,,"I went in to buy international multiple charger. They are are world of household items. Be it grocery , vegetables , cosmetics , bakery. You name it and they have it. That too at very reasonable rates. They have a Indian Restaurant by the side of it. Nice food , reasonable rates but delayed preparation. Keep 30 mins for order to be served. Worth waiting."
,,Don’t miss Mustafa's a must see,5.0,,"We always come to Mustafa's when we come to Singapore, it is one of the joys to come to. If you can’t find it at Mustafa's it’s not worth having, there is everything here from tag watches to gold jewellery to cheap clothes, food to electronics from the cheap to the expensive all crammed into 5 levels of shopping chaos. It will be crowed especially on Sunday’s. Just bring a strong will and an open mind 5 min walk from the station go in the morning then have lunch out the door in the hart of Little India or walk down Seangoon rd (which is an experience)for 20 min to the Tekka food centre for lunch.
So forget Orchard rd come to Mustafa’s"

This is a rush place 24/7. you will not be able to tell whether its a day or night if you once enter the mall. Also, a lot of south indian and Bangladeshi restaurants are there to enjoy."
,,Best supermarket in Singapore with reasonable price,4.0,,"I've shopped across various malls and supermarkets in Singapore, I concluded that Mustafa is the best of all in terms of varieties, and pricing, best of all it's open all night, and multiple counters, no much waiting."
,,You have to see it to believe it,4.0,,"Quick tip, best time to go there is weekdays and as early as possible.
For the mother of god, don't go there on a Sunday at 6pm like yours truly.....
This place is fun, we didn't go there to shop, we went to see it but ended up leaving with 8 bags.
You can buy literally anything from toothpaste to gold.
I was amazed how much gold they had for sale there, it wasn't of high quality and it was made out of soft 22k gold, but it cheap!!!
You can look like Mr. T for not more than $5k, I'm not kidding!

Many locals go there to buy food (but not on weekends).

Prices, I don't know really, everything appeared to be cheap but there were quite a few items of questionable authenticity. Don't expect to find high end brands here.
Again, if you want to have some fun and perhaps pick up something like a souvenir, this can be a cool place.
Electronics, you can buy the latest MacBook Pro and 10m away you can find remnants of 20th century tech. Amazing

Give it a go.

Cheers"
,,Everything you will need,5.0,,Whatever you need they have it. The other bonus is they are open 24/7 it’s soooo convenient that you can shop anytime when you are free ! They have all items under one roof. The prices are competitive so do compare outside.
,,Mustafa Centre,4.0,,"I first visited Mustafa Centre in 2005, and there and than I decided and made up my mind that I will never visit this vicinity again. So much cleaninness in Singapore and so much dirt in the vicinity of Mustafa Centre.

But now in 2018, somehow I planned a visit to Mustafa Centre, and here I am, really happy to see the area. Too crowded but I surely witnessed, the famous Singaporian discipline. Food over here is considerably cheap. Street food restaurant were great. And last not least visit to Mustafa Centre was great, a great place for shopping. Pricing is competitive.

Here, do eat lots of paratha, Chai, Channa Chaat, mithai and drink lot of Coconut."
,,Visit to Mustafa,2.0,,"All under one roof. 24 hour shopping. Staff are not friendly. We spoke to a few it looks like they r angry with the management and taking it out on customers.

Did good shopping butvwhen we returned to SL foundnout some stuff were of substandard. Samsung earphones for J7, phillips battety for camera. Very sad..very very poor quality earphones.

Dont get cheated. Vety unprofessional staff"
,,24 hour local grocery mall,4.0,,"I went in to buy international multiple charger. They are are world of household items. Be it grocery , vegetables , cosmetics , bakery. You name it and they have it. That too at very reasonable rates. They have a Indian Restaurant by the side of it. Nice food , reasonable rates but delayed preparation. Keep 30 mins for order to be served. Worth waiting."
,,Don’t miss Mustafa's a must see,5.0,,"We always come to Mustafa's when we come to Singapore, it is one of the joys to come to. If you can’t find it at Mustafa's it’s not worth having, there is everything here from tag watches to gold jewellery to cheap clothes, food to electronics from the cheap to the expensive all crammed into 5 levels of shopping chaos. It will be crowed especially on Sunday’s. Just bring a strong will and an open mind 5 min walk from the station go in the morning then have lunch out the door in the hart of Little India or walk down Seangoon rd (which is an experience)for 20 min to the Tekka food centre for lunch.
So forget Orchard rd come to Mustafa’s"
,,Big super market in Singapore,4.0,,Mustafa is good super market in the Singapore we may purchase every thing in this mall on cheapest rate that is open 24 hrs and vary houge mall you may purchase Singapore local chocolate and other items for house hold on cheapest rate from this market.
,,Round the clock shopping centre offering great deals and discounts,4.0,,"Located in Little India with multiple entrances and exits from Serangoon road to Syed Alwi road, it is one of the best places to shop. Also it has foreign exchange counter to change currencies and the rates offered are very competitive. My regular purchases from this place are perfumes, which are available at great discount (you have to buy 2 to get deals), compared to what is offered in the duty free shop at airport. Even though they charge VAT, there is a desk available in basement 2 (-L2), where you can go and get a certificate for spends above $100, and you get a 5% off at the airport as refund.
The crowds milling around all the time could be a deterrent and the place is crammed with too many things, which could be quite a task to locate what you want, but once you get used to it, it could be a good place to shop."
,,Go with a list.,3.0,,"As an 'all under one roof' emporium, I'm sure this place is exceptional for those looking to buy specific goods. However, as a tourist spot, it's really too busy and chaotic to be worth dedicating time to."
,,Not good for tourist,2.0,,"It is good for day to day items, not much for tourists.There was too much rush. Shopping at Bugis street is much cheaper and comfortable."
,,Full of Enjoyment of Shooping,5.0,,If you are with your friends and family must go to mustafa center where you will get everything you need.
,,a good shop,4.0,,i was shopping with my wife for formal trousers and shoes through illness i have lost a lot of weigh and it took 4 goes to get the correct size the staff were very patient with me and in the end i had the correct wast and leg size . we then moved to the shoe department where we found the service to be just as good as the other department i soon had the correct size and style thank you mustafa the only problem was that we came out of a different door and became a littel lost for which my wife was not about to let me forget until i found a landmark i recognised and i was let off
,,Everything under one roof,3.0,,"It’s the only 24 hours shopping mall in Singapore. The question is what is not available in Mustafa! Almost nothing!!
Best place to get Indian stuffs. Cheaper to buy many stuffs. Have a huge collection of almost everything. Only problem I have found is too packed with stuffs that it’s too difficult to walk around easily. Just like you got into a market in India."
,,Massive store!,4.0,,"Everytime I come to sg I always buy my chocolates/goodies for the love ones back home here! It opens 24 hours! Have big selection of everything, they have a lot of fresh goods, candies, chocolates, drinks, biscuits, clothes, electronics, skin care, makeups, etc literally everything that u can think of this store have it!

Fun experience Once I visited mustafa late at night about 11/12pm I thought its gonna be no one inside and I can do my shopping easily(its good to avoid the crowds coz its gonna be so cramped inside) but heck nooo there were SO MANY PEOPLE INSIDE AND AROUND THE BUILDING, im so shook probably everyone have the same thought as me LOL (I assume we went on some festival time thing thats why so many people scattered around the streets and inside the building)

Nonetheless its still a great destinaton if u want to buy ur ‘goodies’ to bring back home in one stop! If u’re hungry they have a small restaurant at the side of the building and have quite a few benches, the food is quite good and reasonably price (fish n chips, curry, etc)"
,,Giant shop,5.0,,This turned out to be a kind sight seeing point for me. Never ending shop and cutting across streets. Must go once if you are around Little India area.
,,All in one place,4.0,,"Well, you could really do with a place with an all in one... Almost everything u need can be found here,... Almost. hmmm. Prices can be either cheap or slightly exp depends on the items. But mostly the prices are cheaper than other places. And they do have these hourly promo and it could be like 50% off for watches/clothings. great bargain. And if u love indian food, you got to try kebabs n curries at their rooftop. Amazing place and worth every cent."
,,What is this place ????? WooW,5.0,,This is a super Market .. i hope i can call that .. A giant one ... Heavily Crowded ... and you can buy anything and everything here .. prices are reasonable ... runs i think 24 by 7 .. so you wanna do some reasonable shopping under one big roof this is the place to be .. just be there to have a feel if you don't like shopping
,,Aladin’s cave has nothing on this place.,4.0,,"This place sells everything from razors to food to clothing to luggage, jewellery and watches. Even if you buy nothing just go for a look around. Cheap prices too."
,,Good variety,3.0,,"I stumbled upon this place by accident. Lots of variety, some junk and some worthwhile items. It’s fairly difficult to navigate so read the map beforehand. The staff weren’t overly friendly in some areas and did the bare minimum. No WiFi in the place."
,,A lot of stuff on sale here,4.0,,"This centre have a lot of stuff on sale. From money changer, fake brand watches, souvenirs and even snacks and other things. You can find a lot of cheap stuff in here. Anyway is quite interesting to see this Mustafa Centre."
,,Shopping before heading to the airport!,4.0,,"It was recommended by a friend to check the products they are selling, looks temporary store outside and inside is full of products from simple souvenirs to expensive ones. We went to the chocolate and perfume section and we nearly could not carry all what we bought. It has a lot of tourist who is there just to shop for present. I would probably go back here if i go back to Singapore."
,,Low crowds. Over priced,3.0,,"Mustafa shopping centre has been known historically for its low priced great deals approach. In the past whenever I have been there, I have been privy to crowds and great bargains. However, as I had mentioned in my last feedback and even now again, its no more cheap. Prices are at par with city stores and even duty free airport stores.
The huge drop in crowds was also very obvious even though being an evening. The staff looks extremely frustrated and disoriented and is one of the most unfriendly staff I have ever seen in any shopping centre. Rude and rough in their language. Only the lady at the gst counter was nice and soft spoken.
Overall did not shop much, except for toys, since prices were not to die for."
,,Huge shopping centre,5.0,,Huge shopping Centre with two buildings. You can find almost anything here and at reasonable prices. Be patient to move around the centre and you surely find what you looking for. Enjoy!
,,All your shopping needs,3.0,,You can shop for anything here. Electricals to supermarket to saris to luggage. If you are on a shopping trip in Singapore then start by buying a new suitcase and then work your way round the other floors to fill it. I believe this store is open round the clock. For the rest of us this shop is really full of all that stuff you do not need and do you really want to carry through various airports. I'd rather spend the time seeing something of this fabulous city.
,,Huge shopping centre,5.0,,We were overwhelmed with this shopping centre Something like 5/6 floors of goods to be purchased Very busy. Anything you were looking for was in the shop Including a roof top restaurant which we had a fantastic Indian meal
,,Great shop and experience,4.0,,We visited here after looking for place to buy cheap perfume in Singapore. We bought a few bottles and prices were good. Also picked up a few other things. Shop was extremely busy but had no problem moving around. Easy to pay when we were ready to leave and they also have a convenient place to leave shopping whilst exploring Little India
,,Where shopping never ends,5.0,,"A delight for the ladies and a sucide place for men. Will it's a shopping mall which never shuts down. You can get anything from brand watches to camera sunglasses perfumes chocolates grocery etc etc etc. You name it you will get it. If you shop for more than 100 dollar than you can get a refund of 7 percent GST.

Perfumes and chocolates are a must buy and watches too . Amazing collection ."
,,24 Hours shopping,5.0,,Mustafa Centre is open 24 hours. It was located just next to our hotel. During the day time Mustafa was crowded. As it was next to our hotel we went during the night. we went quite a few times there and had something to buy each and every time. You can find almost anything inside Mustafa. Recommended for shopping.
,,An Average shopping centre,3.0,,"I went to Mustafa Centre for shopping, as everyone including my father back in India has highly recommend it because they loved.
I was very hopeful and had planned to do all of my shopping here, so I don't have to waste my time on shopping from elsewhere. But Mustafa Centre is like just another supermarket. There is nothing special about it. I didn't understand how people rated it as a cheap destination for shopping. It's totally overrated. Apart from pricing, they don't have the range and quality, which you can find in other malls of Singapore.
I think Indians like this place, as you can get all sort of Indian food items, spices etc and staffs here understand a bit of hindi."
,,Everything under 1 roof,4.0,,If you looking for almost everything and anything at best prices - this is the place for you. Especially Indian food.
,,A shopping experience in the heart of Little India,4.0,,"It is a huge bazar where you can find almost anything and everything, from medicine to food, from clothing to toys, from shoes to perfumes, etc. Generally speaking, prices are cheaper than in most other stores in Singapore. However, prepare to spend some time in there to find what you are looking for as there are several buildings and many floors witihin each building. It is an activity worth doing for half a day if you love bargain hunting. Close by, you have a MRT station and a decent shopping mall with restaurants and a movie theatre.
Moreover, it is open 24 hours a day. Everytime I went, though, it was very busy."
,,Everything cheaper than market,5.0,,Everything was cheaper than the brand store itself. You name it and they have it. A humongous place and variety. Same thing can be in 2 different places. If you like shopping or if you have to shop go there and have plenty of time and energy for it. Staff helps you when you ask.
,,loved it,5.0,,everything you could possibly think of all under the one roof. buzzy local type vibe. Very friendly atmosphere. Good prices.
,,One stop shop............,4.0,,"Since my childhood I am used to hearing the name MUSTAFA whenever one of my near and dear ones visits Singapore, now that's the name, this brand has earned....surprising.
Recently I visited Singapore and after having my lunch at little India we proceeded to our next star attraction (Mustafa).
Well honestly for Indians living in Singapore it's a boon, but for people like us staying in metro cities have choices like SPENCER...WALLMART..ALPHA in Mumbai.
My point is nothing exceptional as a tourist but huge case study for management students that how one can handle such a giant store so smoothly.....kudos to there owners."
,,24/7 shopping centre,5.0,,This shopping centre is open 24 hours throughout the week and everything is available here. There’s a lot of things for sale so it can take awhile to look around but it’s possible even at 2am. There’s also cafe and money changer at the premises as well.
,,For loadful of shopping..,3.0,,"Multi level huge shoping mall, hugely stocked, difficult to make choice. You get everything from groceries to readymade garments, gold, medicine, sports, shoes, electronics name it, should be there. But you should exactly know what you want, else will be very difficult to make a choice. Difficult also to distonguish between original and fake. Situated in little India, you can see lot of Indianness around big choice for Indian restaurants and other things..."
,,Everything you need and more,5.0,,"You will find here everything you need, except for fornature. The have all sorts of electronic goods, huge pharmacy where you will find vitamins, supplements even chlorella and co, big supermarket with fresh fruits and vegetables and so on."
,,Enjoy your shopping,4.0,,Variety of shops and plethora of collections. You can get both grey and genuine electronics here. There are numerous options for your accessories which comes at a much affordable price than the regular eBay sellers. It takes some time to go through all of the mall but it was worth investing if you had particular list of items in mind
,,Everything under the sun,5.0,,"You name it and Mustafa Centre will have it! This is a one stop shopping centre for everything from toothbrushes to TV screens or gold bars to GoPros! There are 5 levels spread over 2 buildings. Take note of which entrance you walk into as they have a few entrances. All products may not be suited to your taste but it's still quite an interesting place to browse through. We found it a bit difficult to find sales assistants who could assist. Most staff were for cashiers. There was a counter to do GST refunds on the spot for purchases over $100 which is quite handy. We bought a few things we didn't really need but it s a fun experience browsing and discovering them. Oh and to make it more interesting, this store is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!"
,,Standard money exchange,5.0,,The rates they offer for money exchange are quite favourable and falls on the higher end always. The only downside is they do not allow to bargain. We see the rates on TV and ask for trade the required currency.
,,Shopping,4.0,,"This 24*07 shopping mall is situated in the heart of little India Serangoone Singapore, housed in connected two buildings each with 02 basements & 3 stories and a rooftop restaurant serving Indian & some Asian cousin.
This mall consists of gold, silver jewellery, watches, cosmetics,toiletries, electronics, grocery, ladies & gents clothing, garments, footwear and all you would need including groceries to name few.
This mall is always fully packed with shoppers and for me the best time for shopping was after 1Am and between 6 to 9 Am with less or little rush.
You get washrooms at the far end of each story.
Prices are somewhat reasonable compared to most of the other malls.
Chocolates, cosmetics & some other items are competitive with regular offers.
Try to avoid weekends and holidays as much as possible as moving around would be the challenge of your life time.
Help Will be given only on request.
Conversion in English would be the advantage."
,,shopping,4.0,,Go into a never ending array of stuff and shop till you drop dead. quality and pricing is an individual choice but the place was full and throbbing. its open 24 hrs. Happy shopping
,,Cheapest...!!!,4.0,,You will find so many things under one roof at Mustafa Center. Even the currency exchanges there will give you a good rate. I think it is a must visit place. But not a classy high end place. This is a place for the common man to shop!!! Remember to get the reclaim bills of GST
,,Crowded,3.0,,"We used to go to this place to buy souvenirs. Their one dollar chocolate was a cheap and easy pick. But last visit, their price is not very cheap anymore. Also the place was crowded with visitor and very uncomfortable for shopping."
,,Big mall in little india Singapore,5.0,,"The beggest shopping mall in little India in Singapore. Lot of shops in all brands in 1 place and money changers and all sports , clothing, electronics items available in reasonable rates . Mustafa centre is a heart in little India area in Singapore."
,,Overrated,2.0,,Normal prices as anywhere else Arrogant salespeople Unnecessarily crowded Location is in the middle of a chaos
,,Nice Collection!!,3.0,,"Great place!
This Mall was open at mid night. A huge varieties of electronics were there. We bought philips home theater from this mall. Great staff with experience. The clothes and other shops were also there. ""It was a main shopping center in Singpore."" Must visit!!"
,,Service needs to improve,3.0,,"This mall in Little India has multiple entry and exit points and employs loads of Indian tamilians. The service from shop employees is mediocre with most choosing to gossip in tamil instead of assisting buyers. Spread over multiple buildings and storeys, Indian tourists need to produce their passports if the bill exceeds 100 SGD so that they can avail GST tax refund from Changi airport on the way home. I purchased chocolates, cookies, sunglasses, perfumes, talc, shirts and bags from here."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"You can basically found anything to shop for here, especially for gifts. From local to international brands are available but with the cheaper price, especially like parfumes, chocolate, body treatment, clothes, foods, souvenirs, luggage, electronics, etc are more affordable if you buy here and also you can claim the GST. The building is very big and divided into a lot of section based the type of products, so be patient and enjoy shopping. There are some money changers if you run out money, available 24 hours."
,,Anything you are looking for,5.0,,"This store is HUGE. Whatever you could possibly need, you can find here. We typically visit this store once per visit to Singapore. We buy the Singaporean snacks to bring back to the US. We haven't really shopped for anything other than food and medications but I know if we needed to find something, this would be the best place to find it."
,,Large selection but poor infrastructure and terrible service,1.0,,"Undoubtedly great place to shop if you are looking for one stop shop BUT be aware this place doesn’t even have basic infra like functioning toilets, aisle space to navigate your cart, etc. The staff WILL not help and if you come in their way whiilst they are moving the merchandise within the store on trloleys, they will ride over your feet, even a child is not spared! The lifts are never available."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Low budget heaven. You can buy there lot of things a very cheap. Good place to your souvenir. You can spent there for hours. Diy stuff, food, household appliances. A lot of candies, cookies, chocolate etc."
,,Extremely Busy Large Store,3.0,,"It was our fourth time to Mustafa Center. This time it was on a Wednesday, around 12pm, December 27th.

Perhaps due to the holiday season, we found the store rather crowded. When it is crowded, it is next to impossible to gain access to the staff for any form of inquiry. As a result, expect to just help yourself and only interact with the staff for the purpose of making a payment.

Then we decided to go in the morning on the 28th of December, around 8am, and found that the store was almost empty of customers. As a result, we were able to shop in a more peaceful environment. We found that we could actually speak to the sales assistants and ask directions.

As usual, the store is very cluttered with goods and finding an item can take quite a while.
As for the items on sale… what can I say?
They have such a vast variety of goods for sale. However, we found their vast selection of perfumes and after-shaves, were expensive, compared to what is available in Melbourne Australia. Perhaps this is due to their import duties and sales tax?

Also, the prices for technology items, such as USB cables, head-phones, SD cards, portable hard-drives and general computer accessories is not very cheap. You will find better bargains in proper IT malls, such as Sim Lim Square, or in Hong Kong, or right at home on eBay. Often the gear they carry is at least a generation or two behind. As an example, they had many network switches which were only 10/100 Mbps, not gigabit. So, know your prices and know what you are looking for, before buying.

We purchased some curry powders from their vast selection of products; things you just cannot buy in Melbourne, and which were reasonably priced.

In addition, we found many of their shoes and clothing items to be very low quality and not worth buying (even if you could find your size)."
,,not my cup of tea,2.0,,"It's HUGE yes, it has everything yes, but its also just one big store. it's great for the locals but its narrow and a bit of a nightmare to navigate. Not a tourist hotspot in my opinion"
,,"Mustafa Center - A ''must see"" in Singapore but ONCE",2.0,,"Visited Mustafa Center with my wife and daughter for some shopping. This is an amazing place, both for its gigantic size and the variety of products it carries. It seems it has every thing that a South Asian shopper might ever want.
Unfortunately, despite the above, the shopping experience is miserable to say the least. The shop seems cluttered with very little space to maneuver the shopping cart. It also appears very crowded. No thought has been given to any aesthetics in the ambiance. It gives one the feeling of shopping in some slum shopping mall.
Despite the size, no consideration has been given to the shoppers conveniencce. There is no place for one to sit for a while to recoup ones energy. One has to keep on moving.
If you happen to visit the rest room, it is guaranteed you will never want to return to this place again. They are not only miserably dirty, but devoid of any basic requirements, and that at places includes water!!!!!!
Overall a shame that with so much revenue generated from shoppers, ,so little consideration is accorded to the shopper's convenience. I am amazed the government of Singapore does not insist on some basic standards to be maintained.
Definitely not seeing me there again!!!!"
,,Best in Singapore,5.0,,"Best place (No.1) in Singapore for Shopping, u will get all in Cheap Rate, Per day if u perchase 100 Doller, then u will get Vat Refund also.., Shopping good in DUBAI, Bcz there Don’t have Tax. In Singapore best here..."
,,A shopping center and attraction at the same time,4.0,,The shopping center is huge stretching over 2 streets in munlty level. You find almost anything you can imagine. Located at little India. I was there once at Sunday with family. Very crowded in sundays. The next time at around 12 midnight very calm. If you skip Sunday then very fine or choose Sunday to see the Indianl community shopping and meeting at the shop
,,Pretty horrible,2.0,,"I seem to have been back to Mustafa a few times this year, usually to accompany others. Each time I'm never that inspired. It's pretty chaotic inside and if you get the timing wrong the queues can be significant. Just a dirty and pretty horrible place. Better to go elsewhere if you can. It gets particularly crowded in the evening and on Sundays."
,,Crowded,5.0,,This place always crowded of people's. So many things they sell inside one huge building. Easy to get lost.
,,Mall that has everything. Literally.,4.0,,"This might be the biggest mall I might have visited during my trip. It has everything. Literally everything. You won't know things existed until you visit this place. And that too for a cheap price. Really great mall. Has a great variety. Even if you don't want to buy anything, do visit atleast once. But it is a little dirty."
,,Legendary 24 hour mall,5.0,,Mustafa is a legendary 24-hour mall in Little India. You can practically buy anything from any country as they import from a large number of countries. Assign at least half a day for this.
,,Everything,5.0,,"Anything you could possibly need, right there, under one roof! Mustafa Centre is more than a shop - it’s an experience! A highlight of Singapore!"
,,Get your feet ready for some serious shopping,3.0,,"This place has multiple levels, has everything you can think of, and best of all, it is open 24 hours DAILY! I had a blast burning some money (and calories) here."
,,Good deals!,4.0,,Good deals specially on perfumes.. must visit if you’re looking to buy some perfumes at practically half the price. Lots of other stuff here too.. it’s basically got everything under one roof. Also it’s open 24x7
,,If you want it they got it,5.0,,While it’s a little difficult to navigate they have everything you could possibly want or need. Great place to go shopping
,,Mustafa Centre,4.0,,"It's my 2nd time visiting Mustafa Centre. It's a huge 24 hours shopping mall located in Little India, with 4 storeys, and sells a huge array of stuff from groceries to comestics to gold jewelries! You can literally spend a few hours shopping here, and it's pretty interesting to browse the myriad of stuff that you don't see in other parts of Singapore even if you are not buying anything. Prices are not exactly cheaper than elsewhere but there are good deals for some items."
,,General,5.0,,"The mustafa shoping mall where we Can get almost all things from vegetable to gold diamond ornaments at reasonable rates especially for indians se het almost all items of daily use, it is one of best shoping complex for visitorz"
,,Shopping Time,4.0,,Located in the Little India this place has all things which if you are from India you would need plus lots more. Its huge you can spend hours here. Must visit when in Singapore for shopping.
,,24/7 shopping mall in Singapore,4.0,,"This Shopping Mall is located near to Farrer Park MRT. Car park is available inside the mall but quite small. Street parking is available. You could say one stop shopping mall since it's available all the products. But some branded items are not available there. I would give 5stars if the staff is kind & friendly to talk. For eg. this is not good to say to customers who are buying exp items like ""This is the last piece. If u like it, take it. If not, leave it."" Nobody will buy even how They like it. Apart of staff behaviors, everything is perfect.."
,,Shopping in a maze,5.0,,"Mustafa is not justa shopping mall, its a maze! Its great way to spend time going in from one entrance and after an hr going up and down ending at another exit. Wide variety of products I guess they habe it all."
,,You name it; it's for sale here.,4.0,,"Huge, rambling building with many floors selling everything!. We bought toiletries, travel bags and shoes.Crowded and noisy, but good prices and everything laid out well over 3 ? older style buildings joined with enclosed walkways. AND..... it's air conditoned!!!!!"
,,Organized Chaos,4.0,,"You must go to the Mustafa Centre when in Singapore. Luggage lost? No problems they are open 24hours. If you looked hard enough you could probably buy a car, they have nearly everything!!!! Great for menswear, cosmetics, fantastic pashminas (for very little money), electronics, luggage, not so great for womens clothes, but you can win them all! The joint is jumping with people and stock.....across all three buildings!!!!"
,,Shopping galore,4.0,,"Yes it is a different place for shopping. Yes it is off the beat. It is worth all the hassle. Textile at the basement is fab. It comes in 6meters pieces. Because it is for a sari . Prices varies 15-60sing dollar for 6m. Remember to buy lining too. The old Indian men are so sweet and very helpful. Schampo, beauty products are almost for free. Luggage and related products are very inexpensive. Taxfree in the basement. Go go go, because your worth it. Give it 2-3h."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"With the varierty of options to shop from, this place is amazing. 24 hours shopping experience under the roof."
,,Did anyone say gold?,4.0,,"After reading about the Mustafa Centre, I decided to have a look for myself. In terms of general retail shopping, I wouldn't say that it was especially cheap or fantastic in terms of variety. However, the jewelry section that covers most of a entire floor is another thing altogether. The amount and diversity of the gold jewelry on offer is astonishing. Note though that it is not inexpensive. Necklaces, bracelets, rings and so on are 22ct (I asked the assistant) and priced by weight (that is by gram of gold). Designs tend to be rather in traditional in nature with some items clearly aimed for special occasion wear such as weddings; other items might be worn more often. Silver and gemstone jewelry is also offered and this seemed quite reasonable in cost. Tax on purchases over $100 are refundable for tourists and the centre will complete the paperwork for you. You have to present this at the airport to receive the refund."
,,Not cheapest shopping mall but 24hours ready,3.0,,"I have visited this shopping mall because they ready 24hours open for shopping, but if u want get cheapest souvenirs not here, because i saw the same item in bugis street more cheaper than here"
,,Good Shopping,4.0,,"A place where you can get absolutely anything. There were some very good offers and the prices were quite reasonable and the quality good.
In all of Singapore, Mustafa Centre had the best exchange rates and exchanged almost every currency.
Definitely worth a visit for all the shoppers."
,,Mega Shopping at Mega Shopping Mall,5.0,,"Mustafa centre is most famous, well-known & crowded mega shop in Singapore open for 24 hrs.The centre is situated near Kitchener Road very near to Little India. Better option is take MRT to Farerr park station (200m from Mustafa centre). It is convenient to visit in late night for avoiding huge crowd. Each floor has different items like toys, clothing, grocery, stationery, gold, luggage, footwear, beauty, wellness etc. Since it's a old retail outlet the layout is not modern. The escalators are not easy to find. Billing is quick and queue is well-maintained, Several billing counters are available in each level. There are so many floors studded with different types of products. Jewellery section seems very organized & a good choice to purchase jewellery items. It's spread over a vast area and they have almost all the items one can even think of. Things are spread over a vast area so that one has chance to be confused to find his appropriate things from huge collection. The staffs are helpful to guide. Card payments are accepted and one will be given a refund of the gst tax if is shopping considerable amount within a day. Mustafa Center is also very good choice money changing."
,,24 hour shopping,4.0,,Stayed for a couple of nights in Singapore and this is the best place to get anything under one room. Price are not really cheap compared to last time probably because now it has gotten really popular..
,,Reasonable perfumes,4.0,,24 hour store which has everything you need. They have good collection of perfumes at reasonable prices. We wanted to buy baby clothes and toys but they had very less collection. good variety of chocolates.
,,Depends on what you are looking for,3.0,,Not sure what I thought this would be but it is a 5 level discount department store. So if you are looking for some inexpensive items then you should be fine.
,,Good place for 24 hours mall,4.0,,Urgently needed stuff? Here's a real great place to go to but in terms of pricing Mustafa it's slightly more expensive than what you're going to pay outside.
,,24-hour shopping option in SG,4.0,,"We discovered Mustafa very late in our stay back in February. My husband and I would often go to Bugis for any souvenir shopping. But we were really surprised that Mustafa offered a huge variety for all kinds of shoppers. We came around 11pm, and the place was brimming with people! Admittedly there are some items that you can probably get cheaper at other places, so you have to be smart and don't rush in to buying it immediately. But for those who needs to do last minute shopping at odd hours, Mustafa is the place to be."
,,Always love it,5.0,,Not sure how they can offer cheap price for the products but its really cheap! Will always come back here. So far the things that i’ve bought are authentic so i will continue buying the products here.
,,Great for early morning shopping,4.0,,If your up early due to time change issues head here it’s open 24 hrs and just a 2 block walk from the Ferrer Park MRT (take exit A out). Head to the second floor for souvenirs; and lots of local food items to take home (we watched what the locals were buying like Basmati Rice and other spices and we decided to get some of those things to take home. Did not think the prices on watches; sunglasses; jewelry were anything special. Place is Huge. Grab a basket; shop throughout and pay at any cashier (it’s not different merchants as it might appear - just one big place).
,,DO NOT BUY COSTLY ITEMS FROM MUSTAFA THEY ARE CHEATING,2.0,,"I bought a costly suitcase and found later the same is overpriced later. Mustafa small items like rice , vegetables may be at normal Price , But any electronics etc and other costly items do not even go near Mustafa . There are much better shops at orchard road and various other locations"
,,Just a megamall,4.0,,Only place in Singapore which is open 24 hours for shopping. Claims to be the cheapest but perhaps Chinatown takes that spot.
,,Diwali visit,3.0,,"too crowded in the evenings & weekends. You will get all services here, but not very clean surroundings, hence very average"
,,Mid night shopping..good experience,4.0,,I visited this place for the 1st time.. best part is it's open till mid night..full day you can roam around in Singapore and late night can be utilized for shopping if you are shopaholic..from electronics to chocolates to clothes..to different mobile accessories.. you get to see everything..it's an Air conditioned mall and overall neat and clean ..
,,Mustafa Centre,4.0,,This shopping center has almost everything that you will need from clothes to groceries under one roof. Great prices too.
,,Good place to visit,5.0,,"This place is like a mini india . A good place for shopping at Singapore though . This place has many sections like for groceries, bakery, food,gold, health, kids , electronic, kitchen, cloths, accessories etc.Its a huge place and u will really not cover the entire place in a day. Bcz they r 3-4 building. Few across the road. Do check everything twice before buying for material quality. This place also offers a good eating section in the same complex."
,,Focus on volumes rather than customers,3.0,,"The variety is far too much and the spread is awesome. However, display is poor and also moving about is quite a pain. Also stuff is not all that cheap. Directions are close to being called missing.
The amount of stocks that they seem to have suggests that this is a volume game.
For sure would go again only because you get all under one roof."
,,"Too much stuff with poor display, assistance and understanding",3.0,,"You get an awesome place- stuff it with all kinds of things and then get them bitterly strewn all over the place- as if it has no value or attraction - That's Mustafa !

You can get excellent offers at this place for perfumes, cosmetics, branded sports wear- but the entire presentability is so shabby that you would feel robbed paying up for them.
They are definitely understaffed for the type of enterprise that they are undertaking. You won't get anyone to explain anything to you or to fetch the right size for you. Its just you and the deluge of stuff around you. They should do better!"
,,Amazing Shopping Centre,5.0,,"This place is mad....busy, lots of things to buy, almost you can buy anything you want in this centre. You must be prepared to spend a couple of hours here just to browse through all the levels."
,,Mustaffa Centre- ony 24hrs is the gd point,3.0,,"Its 24hrs. Some may find its cheap. BUT pls consider looking around first. Not all things are cheap. Also, if you go to their electronics section or cloths section you may find that items of more than 2 yeras ago are still selling at the same price as 02 years back without any reduction as in market. Also, no customer service. You approach one only to be told look for another fellow down there as he or her is not in charge. Down there is like down where as later you will just walk off. If you want cheaper things then suggest that you walk along the same lane at Serangoon road where you may good deals as I find that the gold sold in the outside shops are still of better value and condition than Mustaffas."
,,"SST - Sundar Sasta Tikau - Beautiful, Reasonable and Long-lasting",4.0,,"A mecca for people who want to shop branded stuff for throwaway prices. Pick up 2 bottles of CK or Davidoff at 60% of the MRP. Or pick up cosmetics and 50% of the rated MRP in India. Or even better pick up half a kg of good quality chocolates at about SGD 10. There are shelves and shelves of various types of chocolates and believe me beyond a point it gets a bit confusing to pick what.
The aisles at Mustafa are quite narrow and thus make it a point not to go in a large group to shop. Or if you do, then split up and purchase separately. There is too much of rush of people to buy things. Alternatively, perhaps you can go in the late evening and shop till late night, that is if you have a transport back home. The shop is open 24x7.
Also a good place to convert your USD's to SGD's. Though we carried SGD along with us.
All in all a good place to shop your while away."
,,24hr Great Shopping Experience,5.0,,"This is a huge shopping mall. Almost everything are here. We got lost in here with lots of choices. Everything cheaper than anywhere else. Well organized mall. Electronic items in one floor, shoes and cloths in another. Groceries, chocolates, shoes.... Wonderful shopping experience."
,,Good for groceries and provisions,3.0,,One place where you can find a lot of food provisions which are used for Indian cooking...wide variety and organised which makes searching for a particular things easy
,,Place to buy Chocolates,4.0,,"I spent an entire night few weeks back at Mustafa Centre. I like to call, it is a place for Chocolate lovers. The prices were very reasonable. There is a money changer in the premises and it is very convenient. The place is not modern looking. But OK . It is a departmental store where you could shop most of the things you want under one roof"
,,24hr mall but lost it’s charm,3.0,,This is huge mall but selling groceries to all items here. We purchased toy from this mall. No much charm now - we heard a lot but we got frustrated feeling entering this building. Ok to time pass.
,,24 hr round the clock open,5.0,,"Chocolates can be purchased here. 24 hrs open. you will all sorts of electronic items, groceries, watches , shoes , utensils, appliances ,etc. You name it they have it."
,,Huge and cheap mall..,4.0,,The place is located in Little India and sells anything under the sun.. from soaps to laptops.. it is crowded and open 24 hours.. they have a money changer offering the best rate in Singapore
,,"Wide area, cable ties and more than 1 entrance door",3.0,,"Just make sure, you have much time to go round in this dept store. Many foreigners come to search all souvenirs in this place. All item u can found in here.
For chocolates candy, I suggest just buy some wellknown brand only. Too much choices, but sometimes the taste not too good.
Some unique activity all ur belongings in plastic bag or ur bag will be tied up with cable ties during ur shopping in here."
,,Big Shopping at Reasonable Prices ...,5.0,,This is one king size shopping market .. You find anything and everything just under one roof and at the most reasonable prices you can ever see .. we did a lot of shopping to take back home ... You find products from the cheap variety to the costlier ones and they all will be much cheaper as compared to the other markets ...
,,Awesome Shopping,4.0,,This place is just about 10 to 15 minutes on foot from the train stop. I had an amazing shopping experience here co everything was sold cheaper than the other shops. I will surely be back to do more shopping.
,,A Shopping Experience to be Reckoned with,4.0,,"wonderfully chaotic and overwhelming, brimming with goods from China, South Asia and ASEAN. Competitive pricing. If the staff were more pleasant, the Mustafa mystique moght be lost.
This is not every man's shopping however I always hit this mall qhen I visit the city state
Bring your passport for GST reimbursement on your purchases and notify the cashier prior to checking out that you want the GST refunded.
A plethora of good clean rearaurants fill the charming row houses in the surrounding streets."
,,Shoppers paradise; but now expensive,4.0,,"Mustafa is a shoppers paradise. Everything under one roof. Bought lots of chocoloates. Though surpisingly the perfumes and other accessories and toileteries are more expensive than other places including duty free (typically should not be more than 7% gst variation).
Never had this experience before at mustafa in the past.
However if u r a crazy shopper you can literally Shop here 24x7.
Don't forget to go and collect you gst refund process in the basement. So make sure your billing is above $100 and ask them for gst refund counter"
,,Huge market,4.0,,"For my India friends this place is like Big Bazaar with much larger space and lot of products, you will find everything inside."
,,One Stop Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"A perfect Shopping mall with all sort of stuff needed, right from clothes, Cosmetics, Kids, Electronics, Watches, Fashion, Shoes, Fresh Vegetables, fruits, Sea foods, Meat etc etc,,,, Cheaper and reliable, Been there many many times and still not explored complete stores as it is huge."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"Really worth a trip to little India to see a vast array of goods, many that reminded me of Singapore of yesteryear."
,,"Mustafa Center, Singapore",2.0,,This is one huge departmental store. Seriously overloaded. I suppose it works for the locals as they can do all their shopping under one roof. The prices are quite good. Definitely will not go back there.
,,Mad Man's Shopping,4.0,,"Shop until you are satisfied. You will get everything from Electronics, Watches, Bags & Suitcase, Perfumes, Foods, Souvenirs, Jewelery, Chocolates, Medicines & Departmental items. One can get anything here. But be noted that some staffs are rude & they don't help you out in finding what you want. You will get a great bargain with many choices to buy. Some time they give combo offers for better price, specially Perfume department. Two buildings are there which are interconnected to one another, you can easily access the other building from First floor.( Help full when you want to bill in a single shot after buying all you need). For foreigners they have 3-4 Money exchangers, One inside the 1st Block & 3-4 outside Mustafa Centre(Check Surrounding areas), they will get your money exchanged for better prices immediately. You have many Indian restaurants outside Mustafa for Breakfast /Lunch /Dinner.
Mustafa centre is open 24 Hours, Gold section will close at 1 am. After all the purchases keep the entire original bills to avail GST while departure in the airport. Gold can be purchased by showing passport for foreigners. After buying Gold you must update details within 4 hours of purchase at Mustafa GST counter in basement floor. After all purchases done, you must get all your bills consolidated into single bill in Mustafa GST counter before you leave to airport. Note that bills must be more than 100$ in a single day to claim consolidated bill at Mustafa. At airport you must first head on to GST counter & get your GST refund approved before checking the baggage, after this you can drop your bag for check in. Later after the immigration inside the airport, you can get your GST refund at GST refund counters, after this head on to Money changer to get currency changed.
You can stay in Park Royal or The Park Hotel, both are near to Mustafa, in Little India, also near to Farrer Park Metro Station. One can access Mustafa every now & then if you stay in these hotel."
,,"Crowded, congested, big",3.0,,"U can get anything here.
Foods (dry/wet)
electronics(price is pretty good,compared to other retail outlets)
Clothing(kids,men,women,sportswear)
Accessories, gold, watch, perfume(price is good too), medications, health products, makeup, toiletries.

I say everything u need u can get here.
BUT, expect crowds.

Not stroller friendly. Pls its best not to bring your child. Ur kid runs & thats it its gonna be a maze.

Its 24 hours too!

Shop anytime u need something."
,,Souvenirs Heaven,5.0,,"Took my siblings for their first visit and they were indeed impressed with the things available there. Great souvenirs to get for your loved ones are definitely the miniature perfumes! Great bargain and so many choices! Also, toys and make up items are reasonably priced. Definitely worth the shopping spree. Ohhh, chocolates!!! Chocolates are a must buy too!! It is a one stop center for all everything under one roof!"
,,Eclectic World Shopping Bazaar,4.0,,"Mustafa’s is the place to go to buy and save money on a new TV, Fridge, Dishwasher, Washing Machine it any other home/ kitchen appliance after you’ve been to Harvey Norman and Best Denki to identify the make, model and price.

Samsonite suitcases are less than the prices on the Samsonite website.

Gold bars are sold without GST.

You will find Chocolates, candy foodstuffs, and condiments from all over the world.

They have a whole floor, several city blocks long, full of every type of personal grooming items and vitamins you can imagine and even some that you can’t.

Seriously, you could walk for hours in this place and not see everything they have to sell. The store keeps expanding and will probably stretch all the way to Jalan Besar in the future.

If you get hungry while shopping there are many, many good Indian restaurants on the surrounding streets and there is an especially good open air restaurant on the roof.

Best of all It’s open 24/7 - great for those who have insomnia!"
,,One stop mall,3.0,,It catered to many shoppers. It is a one stop shop for many different needs. Good indian food shops also nearby. The only problem is getting a taxi afterwards to carry your stuff back home😀
,,Watched are very cheap price,4.0,,Me and my family visited this place mustafa and feels like little India very busy place..Some goods are cheap price as watches and Indian pots After all it's worth to visit once
,,Crowded shopping center,3.0,,"Shopping center is always busy, cramped, but you are bound to find anything in there. Prices are reasonable, but grocery items were cheaper at a supermarket."
,,"Oh Mustafa, Oh Mustafa!",5.0,,"This is the quintessentially old Oriental marketplace reinvented as a mall. No Indian who comes to this part of the world can leave without visiting this bazaar. I last visited it in 1986 when it already had an iconic status among Indian visitors to Singapore. It seems bigger now and busier, yet it remains the same. And the Mustafa Foreign Exchange counter probably offers the best deal in Singapore."
,,Overcrowded Department Store,3.0,,"Located in Little India, it is a Huge department store. Its hot and crowded. Its like a Target, Myers and food store all rolled in one. Before you enter you must present your bag or back pack to the security guards who will put a cable tie on the opening, I presume to stop shop lifting. Its so crowded it was hard to look at things. I would presume its very convenient if you lived in the area but we couldn't wait to get out. The isles were small and would be hard it you had a stroller. The lines at the cash registers were long and slow. It has everything you would need but unless you knew where to look you could wander up and down the floors aimlessly. Glad we saw it but didn't buy anything."
,,Quite expensive,3.0,,"For an indian , mustafa centre may be described as an extended big bazar with almost all things under one roof. But if you feel like purchasing souveniers for your relatives and friends back home, It is very expensive."
,,Do some targetted shopping - make a list!,4.0,,"Mustafa centre is a one stop shop and is huge, and well mostly crowded. The place is open 24hrs, so you can easily go there later in the night. But make sure if you have limited time, you make a list and go, as there is nothing much to explore. Lugagge section is great with some very reasonable options. You can pick chocolates and snackes here at good price. Watch store is also amazing with many options and again good pricing.

Its a place to buy some good gifts for the family, certainly!

How to get there - either take MRT to little India and walk approx 1 km to the Mustafa centre if you want to see the India market and a Indian temple (not an exciting option at all), or the other and bettet option is take MRT to Farerr park station (200m from Mustafa centre)"
,,One stop shop,5.0,,Mustapha centre is a one stop shop. You'll get anything your heart desires. Great and friendly atmosphere.
,,One stop store for all your needs,5.0,,"The front store facing the serangoon road has been razed and construction for a new building is on. The syed alwi road side the buildings are intact and it has 2 basements and 3 levels. Each floor has a different depts like toys, clothing, grocery, stationery, gold, luggage, footwear, beauty, wellness etc. Since it's a old retail outlet the layout is not modern. The escalators are not easy to find. All the stuff is discounted and less than duty free. It's a predominantly Indian oriented and caters upto middle class Singaporeans. We bought small umbrellas, raincoats, Tsa locks, laptop trolley, axe oil and tiger balm, Hershey's, toblerones, bvulgari perfume, cosmetics, Casio watch, laptop trolley (less than India and options are more), cycle headlight, remote toys etc. Billing is quick and there are no queues, because of several billing counters in each level. Outside opposite to this centre in syed Alvi road you have all tamil hotel chains like ponnusamy, anjappar etc. Finding a cab outside takes time but they keep coming in plenty, some cabs cheat you by charging extra. People say Murtabak dish here is very famous but we haven't tried though. It's a Kheema stuffed parotta."
,,Musthafa centre... The world of shopping.,5.0,,"Musthafa centre is located in little india singapore, a wonderful shopping place which is working 24 hours a day except for the jewellery which will close ay 12 am. It's spread over a vast area and they have almost all the items one can even think of. Things are spread over a vast area so that we will even get confused, which one to fake out of the huge selection they provide. Whatever we feel like we have to ask the staff there who will guide you, because it may be at an entirely different building. Card payments are accepted and you will be given a refund of the gst tax if you are shopping for more than 100 SGD within a day. Don't miss to visit the place."
,,Open 24 hour!,5.0,,"This is a place if looking for everything under the sun! From electronics to pharmacies to toiletries to chili oils. And the great things was that its open 24hr.

I always visit this place every time I went to Singapore. And you can find keychains and fridge magnets are cheaper than anywhere in Singapore.

To go there, just hop into Ferrer Park MRT, and there will be directions to Mustafa Center; around 7 minute walk.

Happy shopping!"
,,"Madhouse of Shopping, actually let's say madhouse of purchasing",3.0,,"A. Mustafa is the best place for money changing. Predictably must better rates than Airports.

B. You can find almost every item of daily use and/or specific purpose here. It's like a very disorganised Carrefour. Except it also retails gold and jewellery, watches, luxury pens etc and a fair collection at that. There a very specific mechanical pencil that I was looking for and they had it.

C. Severely chaotic, this place needs a directory or maybe even GPS within itself"
,,cheap deal,4.0,,"good place to buy anything you can think of from Mustafa which is 24 hours, and best rate they have, including foreign exchange, the only drawback is big rush, things are stocked too much and certainly not wheelchair accessible and even not recommend to take kids along. Please do not visit from Friday to Sunday, its a mad rush, and you may hear even lousy comments from local outside in streets, big issue with getting taxi on these days."
,,Anytime Shopping,4.0,,"Convenient budget shopping mall for tourists.After hectic sightseeing just stroll into the mall anytime,buy gift items.Try traveling goods which are reasonably priced.check the jewellery section."
,,Very Compact,4.0,,"Its a very compact hypermarket where you can find almost everything under one roof. If you wanna buy some Indian stuff, you can find everything here."
,,Must-visit Hypermarket in Singapore,5.0,,"Located near Little India, not so near, but next to it, Mustafa Centre is a multi-storey hypermarket. It sells many things that one would ever need, including if you are into Indian-imported goods. The goods are of good quality and the place is always teeming with people buying lots of stuff thanks to the economical prices. Mustafa Centre is located strategically near MRT station and there are a number of restaurants too to stop by and to find something to eat if one is hungry after their shopping trip."
,,Um...fire code?,2.0,,"Dude, I like a great deal like the next guy but this place is one spark away from being a towering inferno with a few exits. I got my Tiger Balm and escaped."
,,A Renowned Shopping Centre,4.0,,"I have been visiting Singapore for almost thirty two years now and right now seems to be one of the most costly places as everything has become very expensive as I have seen a gradual fall of the Indian rupee to the US dollar as once in 1982 one US dollar was equivalent to seven Indian rupees !! And what a fall my countrymen since then !! Mustafa shopping centre is this huge shopping complex now that was once a small place about 32 years ago and it has improved considerably as everything is available under one roof right from electronics, house hold items, food stuffs and various other items that are available in a supermarket and has 4 floors and has extended considerably down the years.The prices here are comparatively lesser than other places and that's why this place is very popular and seems to be everyone's favourite place for shopping. Try avoid going there on weekends as it is very crowded and sometimes there is no place even to stand !!
Dr. Javed Rasheed"
,,Cheap hyper market,2.0,,"One of the largest hyper market in Singapore, having cheap stuff . You get good deals on large packs & cheaper . Can buy stuff over here in expensive Singapore"
,,Economical Shopping Experience!!,4.0,,"Heard a lot about it before visiting to Singapore as a tourist and found it equally good.

Good in terms of the prices of stuff like cosmetics, perfumes, electronics, toys, etc. which are very reasonable. Specially if you are travelling from India or Middle East where these items are quite expensive you will find definitely love this place.

A bit congested to move around but the price at which you will get the things will make you forget about the discomfort :)))"
,,Cheap Hypermarket in Singapore,5.0,,"If want to find anything cheap in Singapore and want to get gst tax refund you can just buy it all your souvenir etc here. They sold everything from watch, electronic, medicine, chocolate, luggage and bags, sport equipment, shoes, daily needs, and many more. They open 24 hours. One of place should come when you go to Singapore."
,,Average,3.0,,"Mustafa CENTRE is a most popular shopping center in Singapore . So many times I visited Mustafa center in Singapore. Product quality of Mustafa center is average. Nothing special in Mustafa center. Singapore is a most expensive country right now but Mustafa center products are very ordinary. If you want to buy world most popular brand and expensive products in Singapore you have need to visit Orchard road, Marina bay in Singapore."
,,mustafa singapore,4.0,,superb centre for shopping and worth the money spent. All branded perfumes avaliable and much lesser than duty free . so go for it.
,,Everything you can find here.,4.0,,"24 hours giant covenience store. If you love busy place, this is right for you. Chocolate,snacks and wide range of products. Duty free counter is available inside."
,,24 hour dahl bhat power,4.0,,"Really feels like travelling when you rock up to old Moosy after a late night little Little Indian Indian.

It is an I treating joint, but not really for the shopping - and I wouldn't point a white guy, definitely not a single white girl, here for shopping. For different reasons. White guys: there is nothing here for you (and what are you doing hanging around malls anyway?). White girls: you may not feel so comfortable (though that is probably based on some deep unfounded fear created by the media... and the men staring at you).

But hey, if you are in the neighborhood get your bag checked by security and enjoy the mirrored everything."
,,cheap price and very affordable,4.0,,great place to shopping since its 24 hours shopping complex. the item sell quite cheap compare to orchard road especially perfume. recommend if you stay here go shopping during midnight since its very crowded during the day.
,,Everything under one roof,5.0,,"We spent 3 full days roaming around this huge shopping mall which consists 4 or 5 floors of 1 km length , no exaggeration . It has everything for every one . Most of the items are imported from China and not the best quality, but convenience of buying everything you want at one place at any time ( open 24 hours) is the plus. Prices are not very high but not cheep also. The place is very crowded on Sundays and evenings . Best time to visit is early morning or late night. For us it was a sopping paradise and enjoyed a lot as our main purpose of the tour to Singapore was for relaxation and shopping. Good place to spend the time after site seen tours , if you are a tourist. However place may not be that appealing to Europeans as you get similar Malls in those countries. Shopping is safe in there and they have a public address system , if you miss your partner/ kids while roaming around."
,,24 Hour open time is the only advantage,2.0,,"The place is not special and not something you haven't seen anywhere else. The prices were not that cheap as people would post here. The staff is very inattentive as they were chatting with each other in all the places wondering why there were there in the first place. The toy section is with such a poor collection, even most of the shops in Colombo Sri Lanka will carry much bigger range!

Visit this place if you like to shop in crowded mall with staff who are not helpful."
,,Everything under 1 roof,3.0,,Great place for shopping as everything under 1 roof. It's open 24/7 and great value. The only downside is the staff. Went there on 2 occasions and both times staff were rude and unhelpful. I was looking for a style of t-shirt for a present and couldn't find the size. The lady staff made no effort to help or look for it. Don't go on weekends as it gets very busy with long queues. Restrooms not so clean so avoid if you can.
,,24-Hour Shopping on a Budget,5.0,,"Mustafa Center is a great shopping haven. You will find everything under one roof. From perfumes to chocolates and luggage, name it and you'll find it.

The City Tour in Singapore is highly recommended. It is very educational. You will learn a lot about Singapore then and now."
,,Taste of Indian Shopping,3.0,,"If you like to experience the hustle and bustle of India, you are in the right place. Practically everything sold under one roof and open 24 hours.You have to squeeze into tight spaces. With such a wide variety of products, one needs patience to explore. Prices seem cheaper than other parts of town. If you have done your home work well bargains are possible. It's important to seek the attention of the sales staff who at time are chatting between themselves or on their mobiles.Best time to visit before lunch time there after it gets very crowded. At times queues for paying can be chaotic and daunting. Keep your wallets/bags secure."
,,Open 24/7,3.0,,"You can shop for everything and anything from Mustafa Centre at a very good price. Huge collection of branded perfumes at a very low price. Very good collection of gold, silver, pearl and precious stone jewellery. Genuine stuff, very low making charges and amazing variety. For foreign nationals can also enjoy GST rebate on products bought. Friendly staff."
,,A ocean for shopping,4.0,,Hell you get almost all the products the product in Mustafa. It's a massive shopping complex. I personally recommend people to shop there on weekdays or at night to have a peaceful shopping experience. Customer service is just average
,,Must visit places for Electronics,4.0,,"Open 24 hrs - Best place for genuine Electronics / Mobile phones / Cameras / Wrist Watches / & etc. The said items are slightly expensive than shops nearby to Mustafa but I feel it’s safe to buy from Mustafa.

Usually crowded over the week-ends

They do refund GST for tourists. GST Refunds are given for bill value S$100 and above within 3 days of purchase. Go to basement 2 GST refund counter and furnish the bill along with your passport. They will add to the system and give you a slip. Once you go to airport you can collect it by cash or add to your credit card."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Located in the little India area , it is a huge shopping centre spread over several buildings. A wide array of groceries, household items, garments , fruits from India can be found. Money changers are also located there. Avoid going there in weekends as many migrant workers gather there and it's gets very crowded. It opens 24 hours a day and those unable to sleep may find their way there!"
,,"Crowded, as expected, with jaded customer service staff.",4.0,,"The lady at the stationery counter looked pretty much done with everything and everyone in life. An item I had picked up didn't have the price on it. So I had to walk down to the place from where I had picked it up (about 10 isles from the billing counter), so that she could use the price sticker on a similar product. That been said about customer service, the products of course didn't disappoint, as usual. We got some great stuff in the home decor section."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Workers should be more helpful. Some of them are very helpful.. everything is available... price are average
,,Not worth the visit outside of groceries and snacks,4.0,,"I had heard a lot about the 24 hour Indian Shopping complex. It is definitely massive, but outside of the food and groceries I would not recommend it as a shopping destination. Chinatown is much better."
,,A must see when in Singspore,5.0,,"This shop is a nightmare of noise, crowds, too little space and too much stock but it is a delight and continues to be absolutely a must see. The store is situated in Little India and is as chaotic as the area itself and very reminiscent of India itself.
I rarely buy anything but just marvel at the quantity of goods and the stack em high principles of the owners."
,,Get A To Z here,5.0,,"Its best place to get all your shopping done under one roof. Its open 24 X 7 and price are good too. There is also Money changer here to change your currency. If you have particular things to shop, Just study the layout before proceed as you will be lost inside. The roof top restaurant is also a must visit, with good quality Indian food as an option."

Thankyouu For Nice Lesson To Me ( Today"
,,overrated,2.0,,people talk about this place but this place sucks. it is more of a departmental store. the shoes were fake. the staff was extremely rude maybe because they didn't understand English.
,,Crazy place but super fun.,4.0,,I visited the Mustafa Centre with my three kids and they all found many things to keep them occupied. We only visited two floors but it is a lot of fun. Items range from swiss watches to kitchy cheap ornamental jewellery.
,,Bargains but not for all items,4.0,,"Most of the items are cheaper than anywhere else, but some are not. Buy in bulk if you want them really cheap."
,,Another disappointing visit,3.0,,"The build up is so high about Mustafa that the expectations are, generally, high. The place though does not meet the expectations with its slightly outdated models, not so economical prices and most importantly cramped isles. Not worth a visit. Preferred Bugis Junction where I could find lot more variety in both branded and unbranded products."
,,One stop shop and eatery,4.0,,"Wow Wow Wow.... for the shop-a-olics this is the place to be. We had more time to explore and wonder around, arrived at around 3pm left way after 10pm after grabbing a bite to eat on the top floor."
,,One Stop for all shopping,5.0,,One stop shopping spot.. You will get anything and everything there.. its a huge super market which is connected through underground
,,Everything you need 24/7,4.0,,"The Mustafa centre is a massive complex with everything, from clothes, jewellery , electronics, medicines, groceries etc and there are money changers and restaurants opposite the centre. Variety of Chinese restauarants as well, so not just Indian. Prices are reasonable dependant on what you want. There is a baggage counter on entrance on most doors for a minimal fee as you cannot take large bags or backpacks in. The centre is walking distance from Little India MRT. Or you can exit at Farrer Park station as well."
,,24 hours of everything,5.0,,"This place is like nothing I've seen before. It has everything - clothes, food, electronics... Everything, really. It's unique, really being one big store. It's also open 24 hours. Problem is that it's overcrowded and (most of) the staff are far from helpful."
,,Everything under one roof,5.0,,"Mustafa center is a 24/ 7 open big indoor and air-conditioned super market in the heart of Singapore. Yes it is open 24/7 and one can find almost everything here at good prices and deals. Plus there is gst in Singapore but in Mustafa center if you purchase more than 100 dollars worth stuff you go and present it at gst counter in basement and you will get refund receipt of gst amount . This rule is applicable to tourists and one has to show his passport and total of maximum 3 bills of same date total should be 100 or more .
Other than this the prices and variety of stuff from toys to vegetable to medicines to watches to clothes to Jwellery to electronics everything is available here at relatively good prices. It is especially very popular with local Indians and tourists. Also many Indian food resturants and souvenirs and gift shops opp the center. Very good place to shop"
,,A very busy Market,4.0,,"- Mustafa Centre is an indoor market opens 24 hours.
- You will find everything here from textiles to watches and electronics.
- Whatever you need, you will most probably find it in Mustafa
- I exchanged foreign currency at a good rate in Mustafa Centre.
- Once you get outside of Mustafa you will find lots of options of dining.
- Personally I don't like this place it is overcrowded and congested too.

How to reach:
The Mustafa Centre is situated right in the heart of Singapore’s Little India. Taken the North East Line on the MRT and depart at Farrer Park Station, the mall is within easy walking distance

Address: 145 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207704"
,,Nice area!,4.0,,"Went to visit Mustafa Centre, and there was so much choice of goods. They literally have almost anything, all at decent prices, and it was handy to have money exchange services nearby for shopping. I would really recommend exploring the place to see if there is something for you - they sell everything from flip-flops to protein powder, so there's something for everyone!"
,,get anything 24*7,4.0,,Very helpful place to shop for travellers to buy anything.... actually anything ....n yes anytime. I meant for travellers because sometimes we forget to pack an important thing ....but u will find it here anytime via its open 24 hrs. Very huge shopping place ...sure to loose ur group while shopping do take care of children as it's a lil confusing huge place. Very good service s. N do keep a check on time as u might get late searching and finding things....
,,Shopping Paradise,3.0,,You need more than a day shop here. Open 24x7. Not so great ambience. you get everything here. Prices are not so cheap except where they have discounts. you get Original products. Good staff. Good place for buying original electronics. A very famous place in entire Singapore.
,,Cheapest & Complete Place in Singapore,5.0,,"Don't but souvenir in duty free, but always at Mustafa Centre in Singapore.
This is the best & cheapest place in town.
For comparison, if you buy parfume you can get 3 against 1.
I always visit this place when I visit Singapore.
They open for 24hr.
Many Indian food offer in surounding area with reasonable price"
,,Mustafa,4.0,,"24 hours.
Fixed prices.
All credit cards accepted.
Genuine products.

Cafe with limited snacks.

Almost everything can be found here. Depends..

Bad toilets.. Dissapointed.

Very difficult to get a taxi
From 8pm to midnight. And weekends.

So go after midnight. Less
crowded. And easier to get a taxi after midnight."
,,The shop with everything.,5.0,,"Mustafa Centre is my one stop shop when in Singapore, when I say they sell everything, they literally do! From fresh vegetables, Indian spices, puri presses, sev sancha makers, rolling pins, pressure cookers, wheel chairs, blood pressure monitors, Tiger balm. Clothing, electronics, cameras, watches, jewellery, The list is endless, their prices very reasonable, and open 24 hrs. They accept credit cards and cash."
,,One Stop Shop,5.0,,"You can buy anything that u can imagine. Be it groceries, vegetables, meats, fish, confectioneries, medicines, perfumes, cosmetics, footwear, basic clothes name it and you will find it. I love shopping in Mustafa."
,,Crowded shopping centre,4.0,,It's a very busy place to shop.. they got almost everything but it's a halal shopping mall with no alcohol and tobacco that's the USP of that mall.. clothe quality is low but they are best in grocery and other house hold and they got good restaurants on roof top ...
,,Giant Shopping Mall,3.0,,"A really big shopping center, with 2 or 3 buildings that connect each other on the specific floor. You can find wide range of goods here, from clothes to toys and snack. I buy lots of chocolate, nuts, and drugs here, because they are cheaper than other places. And love the variety they provide too.

However, when it comes to food, if you are not into Indian food, then you have to go to other places to get your lunch/dinner. We headed to Chinatown because we can't find anything except Indian food here. Well, it's in the Little Indian area so it's to expect."
,,BIg shopping centre,4.0,,"Its a very popular place for shopping in Little India district of Singapore. It was very near to our hotel so we walked to it. Do carry your passport to redeem the tax while transiting out of Singapore at airport. It was supposed to offer everything at huge discounts, but i fealt that only the perfumes were discounted,rest of the items were of usual prices. however,it offers all kinds of products, you'll find anything n everything here."
,,Only for locals,1.0,,Its not worth it if you don't know what you're looking for. There are a lot of stuffs in there that became impossible only to go for a tour or something. just go if you have in mind what to buy. the parfurms prices are so incredible cheap that we assume it weren't original but we are in doubt.
,,Giant,3.0,,"It is a giant shop.whatever you want will find it here.electronic,super market,clothes,shoes,everything but... Be carefull,check the prices in your country before you go there. I wanted to buy mobile phone and other gadgets and i realized that in greece we have better prices. It is expensive. If you find cheap branded things you must know that are fake.but you can find cheap shoes. You must buy local snacks.so big variety.amazing"
,,Worth going even if you buy nothing,4.0,,"A 24 hr department store spread across 5 floors. Worth going just to experience the chaos! There's sports, toys, food, clothes, electrical, jewelery, haberdashery, homeward, and the list goes on. Tourists be aware that you can claim a GST rebate but you must have your passport with you to do this."
,,Shop any hour,5.0,,This place has everything and anything you want at any hour of the day. This place never p Sleeps. Yes there maybe crowds but that means its popular
,,Wow!,4.0,,"This place is enormous. Floor after floor of everything imaginable, clothing, hardware, electrical, electronics, household goods etc etc. Best place to buy luggage in Singapore. Good quality suitcases at good prices.The building is so big it covers the length of two blocks with the basement levels traveling under a road. Plenty of lifts and helpful sales people. A taxi driver recommended to go late at night when it was less crowded. We went early evening and it was quite tolerable."
,,Huge shopping mall,5.0,,This is the place that never sleeps. That s why I like it. Huge range of products. Must see when you are at Sg
,,Time wasting,1.0,,"People recommended this place and it's not worth going to. There is a big crowd there and you can barely walk in the shop due to the large amount of people. If you have been to Saudi Arabia, this shop is like Bin Dawood supermarket. The groceries are also quite expensive here. The restaurant called copper chimney opposite on the street was terrible and gave us disgraceful food and service. If you have nothing else to do then I guess you could go here but its not great and probably not worth visiting."
,,"24 hour open, good and cheap shopping",4.0,,"Mustafa mall maybe one of the the cheapest shopping malls and centers in Singapore. It's so big and almost everything is there for best prices. Cosmetics, Medicine, Vegetables, Fruits, Confectioneries, Toys, Stationery, Electronics you name it. There are great deals and offers for some products. But I found clothes here are not so trendy and lack of choices. I don't recommend this for buy clothing. Also some consumer electronic products are also have higher values as in usual electronic shops. But overall best place to do some heavy shopping in Singapore."
,,24 hours open...Marvelous!!!,4.0,,"The mall is open 24 hours a day. Visited the place at 6am, we found everything we needed, and more. Great discounts on selected items. Happy shopper here."
,,Cheap and good finds!,5.0,,You can insert this shopping center to your itinerary being open 24/7! Shop here for souvenirs and great finds. I was able to snag some branded bags that are discounted. Be prepared to stay long here though!
,,Complete shop,5.0,,"Visit this shopping complex everytime visit Singapore. Usually we go by taxi and now decide to use MRT and stop at Farrer Park exit C. Do a little walk to the left and straight ahead to Mustafa complex.

Entering this complex you must deposit your stuff such as backpack and strollers. It's quite reasonable because it's lay out is narrow due to lots lots and lots of shelves. We usually buy souvenir items like keychains, fridge magnets, shirts, chocolates, and so on. You can also buy suitcases, backpacks, and so on. Don't expect warm welcome from the staff (in some events they handed me plastic bag and I have to put my shopping item by myself before she ties it)

But still visiting this location, I always have new things to see."
,,A busy place,2.0,,Very crowded.. Not clean.. very rush.. no space to walk inside the shopping centre.. it's all a mess there..
,,Comfortable shopping...definitely NO,1.0,,"Everyone recommended this place.
What a waste of time!
Pathetic indifferent rude service. Paucity of staff a grave issue.
Rest rooms have no water. Tissues have to be bought.
No place for elders to sit. Crowded.
Except for some mundane grocery, not cheap either.
Never buy jewellery...such poor designs..India far better
Chocolates are the only worth buy
Mustafa Tiffin is cheap.
But shopping not recommended"
,,Staff is too irresponsible,4.0,,No doubt its huge mall u can find everything in one stop but its really hard to find what u need as its too many things there .if u ask staff to help you they just tell u go to the end then find right side but actually they also dont know .even there own section they just set and play with phone and ignore the customers alot time i visit there there is only few member which willing to help dear Mustafa centre u should train u r staff well .
,,Disappointed. Overestimated,2.0,,"During our Singapore trip I made sure to include this place in our itinerary due to good reviews but when we got to the place I was really disappointed. The staffs are not accommodating, you could buy typical things and nothing special plus the price are still higher compared to stores outside so I really won't recommend this place to anyone."
,,One stop shop,4.0,,"I've been here several times already. I could find almost everything I want here. Some things are slightly cheaper than other places and others are just a fraction more expensive. I like that there's a wide variety of Indian spices and rice to choose from.

One thing I think needs improving though is assisting customers with the layout of the store. Even though there are signs, I find myself going back and forth between the floors and getting confused. By the train me I'm done my feet ache from all the walking in this huge place.

What's nice also is that you can keep your purchased goods at the security counters outside. If you need to go back into the store to buy more things your hands are free.

At times it's quite crowded depending on what part of the store you are at. All in all, it's worth visiting at least once."
,,"If you like your space, you won't like it here",2.0,,"So many people squeeze through the tight aisles here that you can't stand in one spot for more than 30 seconds before someone else comes around the corner. After browsing through the cheap and poorly made goods, couldn't find anything nice. Everything I purchased here either broke, or for clothing, shrunk, within a few months."
,,Used mustafa travel for onward trip.,5.0,,Use mustafa travel at centre for bus trip to mersing from Singapore. Ticket queuing a little confusing but staff seem to be very professional and have knowledge about visa requirements etc. Got bus tickets for mersing Malaysia everything went smoothly. Also used there money exchange and gave excellent rates. Recommended for travellers.
,,Big Cheap Marketplace!,2.0,,Won't recommend! Doesn't feel like Singapore city. Overhyped. Please avoid! Its just a big cheap marketplace.
,,It probably has what you want- if you can find it,3.0,,"Without a doubt this place is huge and more than likely has what you are looking for but the problem is actually finding that thing you are looking for. There is a balance I think between walking into a shop that is well laid out, where service is available if needed and finding what you need is not such a chore. Mustafa to me is none of these things. It is just an endless array of goods. Unless you are just content browsing around or you know exactly where what you want is, for me I just can't be bothered with it. I would rather pay 10 cents more for something and shop somewhere that is more enjoyable. I'm not saying don't go to Mustafa. It is open 24 hours a day so that is very convenient and to be honest in my travels throughout Asia I haven't seen anything quite as expansive, but for me in the final analysis it didn't press my buttons."
,,An amazing array of goods here,4.0,,"This is one huge 'department' store but so different to the stores on Orchard Road or other malls. It is full of everything you could ever imagine. Very narrow isles, very popular, very crowded but a lot of fun to wander around and see what is available. Not that easy to navigate in the store, signs could be better however you won't get lost and there are many entrances and exits to the store. If you feel like a change from what is available in the higher end stores, this is the place to go."
,,Overrated!!,3.0,,"The place is kind of a godown (warehouse) which has everything imaginable to shop under one roof. There is no other benefit in sight as the discounts are not more than what you get in the normal markets or online shopping.

Worth visiting if you want to see a place where you can get everything."
,,Good place to buy gift items for cheap price,4.0,,"It has two separate buildings. You can buy everything ranging from electronics, gift items, food, costumes, watches and many more. We spent a half day here buying some good items. I recommend this place for everyone."
,,See it to believe it,4.0,,We heard about this shopping centre in Little India and popped in one Sunday after a tour of the area. For the size I'd say it's more crowded than Mumbai! All entrances were closed except for one to control entry. You can get absolutely anything there and it has masses jostling and queuing for cashiers to pay for purchases. Worth a visit even if you're not going there to shop; if the crowds are too much for you choose another day rather than Sunday.
,,Overrated cramped,2.0,,"It may be heavan for cheap products, but it's cramped, poorly managed. Some of the staff are least interested in helping. They don't even know how to smile. Overall I feel its just overrated. Visit only for cheap stuff"
,,Enormous,5.0,,Spread over several storeys and two blocks this is far from a traditional 'modern' store with its own character. You can find anything here from headbands to brandname watches to generic/brandname clothes and footwear to foodstuffs to perfume and soooo much more: and there is a large range in every category. It was fascinating to just walk around and interact with other shoppers and staff. It truly was a destination in its own right.
,,Shop for perfume,5.0,,"This is a regular place my hubby goes for perfume shopping, I think the price is one of the cheapest in Singapore, it's 24 hours and you can buy practically anything here."
,,Cheap and affordable. Exchange rates not bad,4.0,,Was recommended to go there by my friend to exchange money. Ended up changing in Chinatown near our hotel. Had slightly better rates. Great variety at the Centre: western/Asian/middle eastern all available. Big brands and little brands. Worth a visit.
,,Prices are very reasonable and fixed price May 2017,5.0,,"Multistorey building and 24hrs opened for the convenience tourists and local people around the centre. Everything is available from vegetables to electronic items. Sales staff are not much friendly and helpful and sometimes not polite. Lots of stuff to see and buy. If you are visting the country as a tourist, you can get your GST reimbursed to your credit card. Its on Serangoon road and located in a very convenient spot and very close to Little India and Broadway Hotel and Hindu temple. There are plenty of vegetarian restaurents around."
,,All in one store,4.0,,This is the Little India & all possible things from pin to piano are available. They have grown from strength to strength. The foreign exchange rates are the best here.
,,Massive super market,5.0,,"It's a small town in itself, we visited the mall about 4 times during our last visit in 2008 and never got bored. It has lots and lots of things from shoes to garments to watches etc
Had yummy dossas and Thali from Komala's after shopping."
,,"Little India can be crowed, especially on Weekends",3.0,,"First time visiting Mustafa Centre you can feel a bit overwhelmed by the place as it gets confusing walking around the entire place. On top of that, the weekends it is full of people and you can barely walk through the narrow paths. Overall, it has plenty of shopping places and many things to find that other places may not have."
,,Best shopping place,4.0,,We have visited Mustafa market during my stay in Singapore. You will get all kinds of food items and dresses in very cheap rate . Specially the chocolates...
,,"Perfume buyers beware - Overpriced by world standard, cheap by Singapore standards",2.0,,"This place is open 24 x 7 and is a bit of a rabbit warren of shops and traders. I had read that they had a good range of older style fragrances here, so as I was staying with my daughter who lives a block away, I thought I would pay a visit.
So first things first, there are several little enclaves between both buildings that have a range of toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances. Some are pretty basic, brands that are unheard of in the developed world, and some have your standard department store range. It's very crowded and beloved of the Indian population here, so you have to push your way through entire families doing their shopping here.
If you're looking for ""celebrity"" scents...you know, the cheap stuff with Paris Hilton or Jessica Simpson in the name, then you will probably find it cheaper than department stores here. If you're looking for classics, then the range is limited, and there are no bargains here if you're a savvy on line shopper.

I'll give you an example. My younger daughter loves Extatic by Balmain. On Fragrancenet it's US$35, at Mustafa, the same fragrance is SG$77, and at Sephora on Orchard Road, the same bottle is SG$166.
So my advice, go for a wander, buy something you're unlikely to find anywhere else, and do your fragrance shopping out of the US or Europe."
,,Everything under one roof,4.0,,This place isn't as cheap as it used to be however just as useful. This centre has literally everything including many of the known imports. Also has a decent money exchange for good rates.
,,Supply chain Management at its best..,5.0,,One of the few places in the world which has everything and can cater everyone.. The amount of investment done on the supply chain management and details of the goods is really awesome.. A great place to Shop.. Keep spending.. Keep shopping..
,,Large shopping mall,4.0,,This is a very large shopping mall with everything you could need it has many foors with so much stuff of everything you would need from clothes to food prices are ok but you can get very lossed as it all looks same
,,All in one super market,3.0,,"If you are travelling from any other region in Singapore, you will find this place really crowded. This is good for anyone who has to do some budget shopping.
The advantage is that this place is open for 24 hrs. You can find many cheap electronic items to take home. You have most of the Indian restaurants adjoining this shopping plaza. So it's worth a visit.."
,,Minibus Maxi Cab Singapore,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a 24hours Shopping Paradise! If you're in group and need big taxi to travel over, you can call +6593364142 from Minibus Maxi Cab Singapore."
,,MUSTAFA CENTRE,4.0,,"Visited many times between 14 May and 21 May 2017
Very big shopping centre with many levels and open 24 hours.
Can be very crowded with tourists.
Can grab good bargains but no bargaining.
Near little India for eating if you fancy Indian cuisine.
Very accessible and plenty of taxis.
Personally we just like to browse around and will certainly go there again."
,,Prices are not attractive so unsure why people go here,2.0,,"OK it is a huge store with lots of products, but the prices are high and service poor. Place is claustrophobic and not pleasing to the eye in any way. I think that this ""attraction"" can be safely skipped if you are touring Singapore."
,,MUCH ADVERTIZED BUT NOT WORTH,3.0,,"We spent some three hours in this shopping mall on May,19,2017 but could not find what we were looking for and when we did find it, they had only one piece against our requirement of three pieces. Then even for the single piece they had no packing case. They referred us to OG Albert on Bugis area where we could finf all we needed. Again we were looking for Dilmah rea leaves or bags/sachets but could not find it."
,,a very busy mall,4.0,,"Lots and lots of items can be found here. You can do your shopping and grocery at the same time. Offers a lot of products and variety, not the cheapest, but being a 24 hours mall, this is very convenient. Good rate for money changer."
,,24 Hr Shopping Mall,4.0,,"It's a good mall where they sell anything under the Sun. Open 24 hours and hence don't need to reserve time during day. Had its own good eatery outside which runs round the clock as well. Certainly not the cheapest, certain shops in China Town are cheaper but their choices aren't as big. Don't expect lot from Customer Service."
,,Everything under One Roof,5.0,,"Whatever you need, you will most probably find it in Mustafa. Be it medicine, chocolates, sports items, apparel it is there in Mustafa.

As for the cheap items, I found chocolates to be quite cheap. And with the seasonal promotions and all it is very cheap than other places. Even the Little India shops can't beat the price of Mustafa.

Other than that cosmetics were quite cheap.

Mustafa is of walking distance from ferry park MRT station I guess. It is open 24*7. If you are a foreigner and if you purchase over 100 SGD, go to the basement and collect the GST refund forms so that you can claim it at the airport.

Mustafa can be quite crowded in the evenings and weekends."
,,"If Mustafa doesn't have it, it probably doesn't exist",5.0,,"The Mustafa Centre is an adventure in itself open 24x7, always busy and a buzz of activity. You will feel like you need a tour guideIf to navigate the 2 multi story buildings spread either side of Verdun Rd. If you want clothes, shoes, groceries, toothpaste, perfumes, colognes, spices, vitamins, fans, TVs, gold etc, etc then look no further. If you think you are going to duck in to buy one product then good luck. You will become distracted by what really is an overwhelming variety of goods. The supermarket has everything you could ever want whether you are a local or visitor and being in the heart of Little India, has a full range of Indian snacks, spices, breads and sauces. This place is almost its own tourist destination and well worth a visit of exploration."
,,shopping in little india,5.0,,"big shopping center plenty of goods at good prices,all kinds of good available from clothes shoes watches medicines foreign exchange"
,,Grocery & house hold item store,4.0,,"Unbelievable timings of the store, i.e. 24X7 Variety of options in any items. At even 1100 pm, good crowd in the store. Very big store. Located near Little India area and close to Hotel Park Royal, Kitchener Road."
,,Typical supermarket,3.0,,"a 24 hour supermarket in Little India. You get everything here. I changed money here, rate was good. Convenient."
,,Every Indian Thing at one place in Singapore,3.0,,80 percent Material available is from India and almost every customer there is Indian. You can get every thing at cheap prices in singapore compared to other places
,,Terrible Experience in Jewellery section,2.0,,"Though you get everything under one roof, the jewellery section is terrible and overall POOR SERVICE. Attendees just stand and chit chat without attending the customers. I had to wait for so long for an attendee to attend and more than 25 minutes to get my bill and pay. I visited on a Thursday and NOT on Akshaya Tritya."
,,Everything you need,4.0,,Nice expirience to visit Mustafacenter. It has everything for shopping. Just go there and have a look at yourself. It is amazing
,,Every thing under one roof,5.0,,"A wonderful must visit place, Avoid going on Saturday and Sunday, as its too big and too rushy. Best part is that its 24X7 , You will get every thing accept Liquor."
,,one place for all your shopping list,5.0,,"A huge mall having different floors dedicated to different sections. from cloths to electronics to food items to whatever u can think of. fixed rates and reasonable pricing. its open 24x7 so if you want to utilize your time of night, you can visit this place. staff is not very friendly. Currency exchange counter is also available on ground floor entrance itself, providing good exchange rate.

local souvenirs I found to be cheap at Bugis market than Mustafa Centre"
,,Mrs,3.0,,I visited Mustapha centre on a Friday evening. Place was crowded. I bought perfumes from there. Is it real or fake. ? Enjoyed the experience at the centre.
,,Huge,4.0,,"A huge shopping mall located in Little Italy, it has stuff for everyone. It is open 24 hours and offers a lot of branded and non branded items at very reasonable price. It is overcrowded during the day time, it becomes a little calmer during the night. Tourist can claim a GST Tax refund for their purchases above S$100. The only problem with this mall is that the salesperson do not have time because of this crowd."
,,Shopping Center,4.0,,"A 24 hours shopping center with lots of brands and non brands with a reasonable price. Money exchange, foods and gift shops are nearby, good quality products are available."
,,A Shopping Mall with Everything under the Roof,4.0,,"This is Singapore only 24 hours Shopping Mall - MUSTAFA CENTRE @ Little India.
This shopping mall is located at Little India and lots of tourists will visit before they leave Singapore. Best time for them to visit is late late at night, better still after Midnight as tourists tend to be very busy in the mornings and afternoons visiting the Attractions. Whatever you want to find, you can get it at this Mall. Clothes, Jerseys,, Shorts, Jeans, Belts, Watches, Gold Chains, and even Computers, Electrical appliances etc, etc..... You named it, they will have it. They have an Indian restaurant at the highest level for your fine dining. So Tourists to Singapore, don missed this Shopping Mall before leaving for the Airport."
,,"There are some good items on bargain,poor customer service",3.0,,I have been to this place sometimes ago and noticed place is very crowded.Further sales persons are not corporative and rude.Not a place you find everything is quality and cheap.You can't bargain over here.
,,Everything in all shapes ans sizes,5.0,,You will find everything you need in all different shapes and sizes. This store is open 24 hours. So shop anytime and anything.
,,Huge shopping mall,3.0,,"Very big area in a busy location selling everything you need. Household item to luxuries and electronics to jewellery- everything is available. However, staff are very reluctant & unfriendly. They have no interest whether you buy something or not."
,,Everything you need in one place,5.0,,"I visited this place a few times during my stay in Little India in Singapore. It was an excellent place. I could get anything and everything I wanted. Whats more is that you get the tax slip too, which I got cashed out in the airport. The plce is friendly and close to the MRT station."
,,"It's ok, but don't expect any service",2.0,,"The number of goods on display are huge. The aisles are increadebly tight (wonder what would happen in a fire). There are hundreds of staff members. Not one staff member has any training in customer service, and the cashiers are the worst."
,,grocery paradise,5.0,,Going to Mustafa Centre with my 3 y.o daughter. She's so happy and we bought lost of candies and chocolates. This place is amazing..I can find many things from candies to undies that imported from US to UEA in one place with a good price!! Definitely the right place to buy some gift or souvenir while you're in SG
,,Lot to Explore,5.0,,"Great shopping in Singapore. Mustafa is located in Little India. Almost all things are available here at moderate price. You can get drinking water here for a few cents, compared to price of SGD 2-3 outside. Plan well before what you want to buy and, or you may get tired walking around."
,,Ok ok place,2.0,,It offers the great variety of shopping materials but the ambience & the management is not at all good. Only visit the place if you are desperately looking for some shopping items which you could find anywhere else.
,,Great place to shop,3.0,,"Whatever you wish to buy from digital device, food, apparel, toys, house appliances even gold! Mustafa is a 1stop place!

Place is extremely crowded after evening. Recommend to go during lunch time afternoon as mall is peacefully quiet and easier to shop for your needs.

Location wise, is not near MRT as
There is a MRT away from mustafa""Little India"" approximately (15 to 20mins walk).

Overall still a great place."
,,Amazing Midnight Experience,5.0,,i love being in here. this place is always full of people... even if it's midnight! and after shopping is done you can buy snack or other full meal foods in the restaurant near Mustafa. You can find everything in here.
,,Great Shopping Experiance,4.0,,Never have I been in a shop so big to carry so much tat It's a great experience it's a must to visit
,,Everything You Need in One Place,4.0,,"Perfect place to get everything everybody needs all at once. Food, beverages, fashion, sport equipment, electronic, meds, music, body treatment, cosmetics, souvenirs and more. Prices are relatively lower than normal set price. Opens for 24 hours is very convenient to come at anytime we want or need to. Having multiple entrances facing different part of streets and many cashier counters make it easy for visitors to start and pay their shopping from anywhere. While you cannot expect smiley friendly staffs, they are always quick, efficient and helpful. Most restaurants surrounded it are serving middle east food but you should be able to find one or two restaurants or diners serving other Asian food."
,,Organized Chaos!,3.0,,"This is purely a shopping centre for those looking for things all in the one place. There's nothing too special about it. I think it's just the novelty that you can buy perfume, clothes, food and watches all in one go at the one location.
It was interesting to walk around and have a look but it isn't going to blow your mind."
,,one place has it all,5.0,,"i must say that this place almost has it all that we looking for, the store is so hugh, the fact, i once get lost inside the store haha, open 24 hours so you don't need to worry if you haven't bought souvenir for back home. easy to reach, but crowded over the holiday"
,,Love this place,5.0,,Always a stop in Singapore and always spent up big. Remember to take receipts to tax desk to get coupon to claim back tax at airport!!
,,Run Down,3.0,,"Quite disappointing. Not the same as it was a few years back. The building looks washed out and run down. There are a variety of goods. Some are good and some are not so good - quality wise.

Didn't have the same experience had a few years back. It is in a dilapidated state."
,,Cheap authentic perfume,5.0,,"Just had to go there to buy perfume, its authentic and cheap. It is accessible by mrt, just go down to Farrer stop and just a few steps from it you will be there :)

They also have other things that is cheap like branded watches Tissot, Victorinox etc"
,,Waste of time,2.0,,"Waste of time. A lot of rubbish, very over crowded. All cheap items that are over priced. You can not walk around know space. Try another shopping area."
,,Shopping mall with relatively low rates,5.0,,"The best place to by buy souvenir for family n friends. It's a huge mall with variety of things from food, clothes, electronic, watches, cosmetics n what not. The GST (tax) u pay after purchasing above 100$ is refundable to tourist at airport. U need to get ur bill proceeds inside the mall after u make the payment n get a receipt for refund."
,,Absolute Carnage!,5.0,,"Take a department store in one hand, a grocery store in the other, have a whole heap of drinks and smash your hands together. The result is the Mustafa Centre.

Basically it is good for a laugh and nothing more.

The staff are rude and unhelpful. The products are cheap, nasty and often mislabeled. The customers wander around lost like Zombies in a crap movie. The store layout makes about as much sense as going Vegan.

Put all that together and it is a heap of fun to see. I was laughing the whole time.

Not sure I would go back again."
,,"This place has it all, but nothing special",4.0,,"Everything you are looking for can be bought on this place. It is absolutely amazing just to go and visit there. Very unique, but don't expect to find anything cheap or special.
If you have time, just go there for an hour or so and maybe you will find something for yourselves"
,,Normal shopping market,3.0,,This is just like a normal shopping market. Not worth it to visit. Its similar to some shopping market in any metro of India. Don't waste your time if you are in Singapore for a limited time.
,,Just to go see!,3.0,,"This place is worth going to see, as everything under the sun is sold there. However, we found prices compared to Canada quite expensive. If you've forgotten something at home, well worth the visit!"
,,All under one roof,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a huge shopping centre in Singapore where you get all your needs right from groceries to electronic goods under one roof. All the sections like chocolates ,perfumes, watches, electronic are all well organized ."
,,The go to place for everything under the sun,4.0,,"Mustafa is popular amongst locals, especially Indians for affordable shopping and groceries. It also attracts tourists who want to be economical gifts and souvenirs."
,,24/7,4.0,,"It's a good place to buy chocolate or snacks but for souvenir stuff like keychain you better buy in bugis street because it's kinda pricey. The best part of this supermarket is it's opened 24 hours but i do NOT recommend you to go there in Friday night, soooo many people."
,,Get almost everything,4.0,,This place has most of the items available from clothes to groceries. Chocolates to traditional beauty care items.
,,Everything in the World is available but not cheap,4.0,,"Yes, it is true that Mustafa Centre is 24 hrs open. Also, that you get everything from sports jerseys to perfumes to chocolates to god knows what all. But the one fact you should consider is that nothing is cheap or at a lower cost. Yes , they have original stuff so original stuff costs a lot of money. The smart thing to do would be is to identify what you want , go in and buy it or look for cheaper options in the same thing.

It is definitely the place to go if you want to buy virtually anything in this world."
,,"If it's made, they have it",5.0,,"I heard from so many people that Mustafa was the place to go if looking for something special at a decent price, for food or anything else. I went there with friends and was really amazed. The selection is amazing.
Make sure you have plenty of time to walk around. The place is huge."
,,Fun place to visit and buy cheap stuff,4.0,,We usually go there for every day items such as socks tourist stuff....or if nothing else is open and we wanted to fill in some time as it is open 24 hours a day. It is worth a visit just to have a look.
,,If you need your late night shopping on,4.0,,"Was there after 10 pm with a local friend and it was bustling. It's a lot to take in but as long as you have some idea of what you're looking for, you'll be fine. If you thought you didn't need a basket, there's plenty of those scattered around if you changed your mind. Because it's so vast you can just pay for your items on whichever floor you end up on, even if they're from other floors.

I was there about 2 hours tops, but I'm definitely coming back again the next time I'm in Singapore if I have the time.

The electronics here are sold with no international (just local) warranty.

It may be between two MRT stations, but the walk from Farrer Park is shorter than from Little India station."
,,Cheap finds,5.0,,You can find lots of things to buy in this place name it and they have it here plus they are open 24 hours so you can visit this place anytime of the day.
,,A Crazy Place where you can buy anything!,4.0,,"I really don't know how they manage to cram so much in to this shop! It is huge. If you have forgotten to pack something from home don't worry they will have it. .. from tweezers and hair dye, to computers and hoovers...jewelry, gifts..... tyne list goes on. Your rucksack may be sealed before entering to stop shoplifting. They take visa, and seem to always be open."
,,Aladdin's Cave,4.0,,Staggering amount and variety of stock across two buildings. More fun and cheaper than Orchard Road. Little India next door as well.
,,"Inefficient, unfriendly, overall awful experience",1.0,,"The store had mislabelled a discount, which I happened to notice after paying and checking my receipt. As the cashier that I had paid with left immediately after my transaction, I sought out another to help me get refunded the difference, or to just cancel the item completely.

Long (40+ minutes) story short, after a lot of being told go here, go there, ""No we can't help you because you need to go back to the original floor"" kind of rubbish (in the end my refund was processed elsewhere anyway), I decided that this was singularly the worst shopping experience I've had in Asia. No proper apologies were offered (in fact, the lady in charge of labelling the discounts was rude enough to suggest that my understanding of the sign was incorrect, despite my point being proven correct by her colleague), nor did the staff try much to help. Inefficient, rude and overall highly unpleasant. I'd avoid if I were you."
,,Shopping overload - very Crowded,4.0,,"If you do no fear really crowded places and are not a stickler for organized store especially what you see in around in Singapore, then you can venture out. There is a method to the madness and once you have been there once you will start to understand. Do not expect the crowd to be very kind and polite. But Mustafa is a one stop shop for everything you want to buy from electronics to household (chocolates, fruit, seasoning, medicine, merchandise, perfume, beauty product to luggage; almost everything). Their prices are better than many and they also do larger packing. The variety is far greater than what I have seen in other stores. Best it is a 24 hr store so go late night or early morning to beat the crowd."
,,A MUST VISIT MALL IN SINGAPORE,4.0,,It was really a very good super market where all the things are available 24 hrs with multi storied.
,,Crowded and unhelpful,2.0,,"People pushing around. Aisle too small. Careful for the price. Some places have it cheaper.

Staffs are unhelpful. Asked when will next stock arrive, one will say the following week. I came again the week after, a different staff said the same thing. Pushing the responsibilty to another shift worker.

Staffs non chalant if the products have different price as labelled. So beware. Make sure you pay the correct price."
,,One stop shopping,4.0,,"I like Mustafa since I could buy almost everything I need in just 1 place. From chocolate, fruit, seasoning, medicine, merchandise, perfume, beauty product to luggage; almost everything.
It also opens for 24 hours, so you could choose any time you available to visit. I suggest not to visit it on Saturday or Sunday or Public holiday it will be very crowded; you would not enjoy your shopping."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Located in China town. A 15 min taxi ride from Orchard road. Not worth the journey there.

Mostly tightly packed poor quality goods. Lots of toiletry brands at cheaper prices than other stores including perfumes and watches. Not sure if watches are imitation/ fakes. I was expecting to find branded clothing. None"
,,Relatively cheap stuff but..,1.0,,"Overly crowded somewhat rude jostling and pushing around.
Watch and be alert with prices they tried to rip us off with wrong price tag and when challenged they didn't simply care.
Good to buy kaya jams or whatnot for gifts for your friends on your return but other than that I won't be back."
,,Good place to shop in late night.,2.0,,"We've been shopping at Mustafa for a long time, every time come back to S'pore. While living here, we never stepped in. Everyday living, place was too far from where we lived. But ever since we live overseas, it is a great place to shop in bulk & bring back to Australia . Some items are not that cheap but 90% of them are reasonable. You can find almost, almost everything under on roof and they open 24/7."
,,Congested,3.0,,"Open 24 hours. Has everything and anything you can think of. Very congested, aisles are narrow things are all over the place, store situated on different buildings so some times you have to go to and fro to get shopping done. Fruits are very good. Very competitive money exchange facilities offering good rates. Staff helpful. Very cheap but good cafe. Restaurant on roof. And plenty around the area."
,,Offline Amazon Store,4.0,,Just about everything Indian is found here! Amazing breadth of variety. Seems like a Mumbai local if you go during the weekends. Alfredo chocolates are good!
,,Everything in one roof,5.0,,"Best supermarket of Singapore. Open 24 hours , in one roof you will get every thing Prices are reasonable compare to other mall of singapore. Clothers variety need to add more n avoid weekends evening its over crowded."
,,Good for shopping for any purpose,5.0,,"Nice and large departmental store open 24 hours, 365 days. Stocking huge variety of clothes, baggage, gift items, electronics, groceries, medicines, toys, souvenir items, any and everything under one roof with facility for temporary storage of purchased items for next round without carrying bulk for single payment. Reasonable prices, large variety and nicely displayed. Must for all medium class families looking for shopping. Listed for GST e- refund processing on return at the airport, great help of 6% savings."
,,Absolutely loved it,5.0,,"Mustafa centre was fabulous
Open 24 hours 7 days a week. We went twice and the first time we didn't even realise that we had only looked at the ground level!
The second time we went we explored more floors and found heaps of absolute bargains. The streets near by also have shops with great souvenir shopping and Indian restaurants. Well worth a couple of hours of your holiday time"
,,"Crazy place, has everything you could possibly need and its open 24 hours a day!",4.0,,"Whilst it might seem overwhelming to begin with, turns into an experience!
Everything is very hectic but everything is fairly well segmented and easy enough to get to.
Prices are great too!
I would recommend a visit, not anytime around a Hindu festival though as it will be incredibly crowded"
,,"Unique, Interesting shopping complex",4.0,,"Very Interesting place You can literally buy anything you want - food, electronics, clothing, hardware, cosmetics and too many more to list. Prices range from dirt cheap to more high end. The food up on the roof was also very good."
,,Impressive shoping center,4.0,,It is worthwhile to visit this shop even when you do not need to buy something. The prices of the offered items are very reasonable for Singapore and the variety of the goods overwhelming.
,,Great in the Walmart sense but not not like the Beijing Silk Market,4.0,,"This is the closest you get to the Silk Market in Beijing in terms of being able to buy just about everything at low prices, except that there is absolutely no bargaining (everything is barcoded and checkout occurs at tills on the first floor) and so you cannot approach the dirt cheap prices you can get in these types of places in China. Ie if you forgot something at home, this is a great place to buy it at a price no higher than you'd pay on Amazon or at Walmart. But don't plan on bringing home a bunch of bargains in your suitcase. PS actually I bought a nice cheap Chinese suitcase here, something I can't easily do back home, although I noticed the American Tourister suitcases were literally the same price as Amazon."
,,Great Bang for the Buck Shopping,4.0,,The prices for items here are a cheaper compared to a high end malls. Some items here are original and some are fake. It's a great place to shop if you want to find items at the lowest prices in Singapore.
,,Not that great!,3.0,,"This was my 2nd visit to Mustafa centre and I find the place as crowded as ever and full of cheap goods, place ideal for Indian subcontinent since you get stuff they use daily. close to farrer park MRT and little India.
Many Indian restaurants close by"
,,Hectic,3.0,,We visited Mustafa and it was very busy and chaotic. There were people everywhere as we visited on Sunday afternoon. It had a large variety of everything from jewellery to electrical goods to groceries. I bought my souvenirs from here as the prices were quite good.
,,Shopping Centre of Singapore,5.0,,"Mustafa Centre is one of the biggest and famous shopping centre of Singapore. It has variety of products which are required in daily needs. Its like best price or big bazaar. But the price of the products when compared to prices in India, I didn't much of difference."
,,Shopping Center,5.0,,The first I don't know how can I go there but good luck that we have the excellent transportation in Singapore.
,,Shopping,5.0,,Must see. Must buy. It's a different type of shopping... if you are not into the expensive brand shopping- mustafa is the place to buy some cheap beands
,,More a shop than a mall,2.0,,Difficult to navigate - we were trying to find the jewelry - got there eventually but to be honest prices are not that competitive.
,,Great mega mall,5.0,,"In mustafa center almost everything can be found. From groceries, kitchen ware, clothing etc. in cheap prices. The place is big, so for people who like shoping, it can take a lot of time to see everything, but it worth it."
,,The place to rave about,5.0,,"If you have foreigner friends, you must bring them here, whether Asians or westerners.
Mine who visited Mustafa could never forget this ant hill hypermarket. They bought Indian spices and like many others, brought home other things they discovered or never knew before.
For us it's the same, as we would come here now and then to explore.
The textiles at B1 are a good find. So are some fresh vegetables or fruits from India. However, not all foodstuff is that cheap, so a bit of caution.
You can even shop here after midnight, to avoid the crowd. Happy shopping !"
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"A shoppingmall that is open 7/7 and 24/24 and it has everything. From food, clothes, electronica, jewelry, souvenirs, perfumes, shoes, pharmacy,... name it and you have it here. It keeps growing and has 3 big parts already, you can get lost here in fact. Theres also a exchange office and even a travelagency. Prices are good when you compare to other malls. Also the neighbourhood is great to have a walk and watch the cheap shops. Be aware of Friday evening and weekends...locals know this place too and do their groceries then..can be very crowdy. If you, as a tourist, forgot something just go here...you find it."
,,Like KMart on steroids,4.0,,Make sure you have plenty of time to browse when you visit. Huge range of just about anything and everything - from shampoo to stethoscopes... and you can eat outside. Easy access from the train
,,Can buy everything you want.,5.0,,Its a giant mall in good location. You can buy everything there whatever you want. Price also not much high. Very crowded all the time. Surrounded with plenty small shops and can have taxi anytime for your destination. Parking area also huge in lower base.
,,Mustafa shopping centre,1.0,,"Yes, the sales person inside the mustafa shopping centre is poorly trained and simply gape at visitors, when we ask some query about any product....we felt that they treated customers like beggars as if they are giving us things free of cost.

Next time ...think twice before stepping into MUSTAFA!!!"
,,A big departmental store from needle to gold,3.0,,it is basically a big departmental store from where you can get anything just name it . You can find any item from any country . I bought perfumes from here at very good cost . it opens 24 * 7 . so go for it if you want to looking for a specific thing.
,,24 hours of shopping,5.0,,This place is very interesting. Price are very reasonable compared to other malls. A great shopping experience. It's open 24 hours and you can visit whenever you have time.
,,can be visited,4.0,,"heard lot about it, so finally visited it. Was bit dejected. it was more of a big departmental store with lot of Indian stuff. Things are reasonable if you want to bye. I brought Axe pain killer oil. which was very good. and lotion. Dry fruits were at very good rate. But then bye as we will have to carry. Has become more of a local mkt."
,,All Indian Items available,4.0,,"Its near little india and has a wide variety of indian snacks, also there are lots of indian food restaurants neaby its good for food items and also has electronic and gold shops unfortunately, its not as clean as rest of singapore"
,,Best ever 24 hour 7 day a week one stop shop !,5.0,,"My husband and I were staying at the One Farrer Hotel and Spa, which was a 5 min walk away from the Mustafa centre .

Honestly we'd never seen anything like it, anything and everything you could ever imagine is sold here, from food, to groceries , warm pizza, cakes, watches, souvenirs , make up , electronics, luggage etc you name it and Mustafa centre is surely going to have it.

We said we'd only go in for a few things but would walk out with more items and honestly one can easily spend a few hours here purely exploring the different floors and section . I would most definitely recommend coming here, I've not seen anything like it . If you feel you need to get away from the outside humidity or cannot sleep , go to mustafa centre for a stroll . The atmosphere is lively and I guarantee you'll come out with a purchase of some kind ."
,,Got everything you want,4.0,,"It's a very nicely planned shopping center. There are proper sections for each and every category and I think you can find almost anything in here. And by anything I do mean it. While not a must see place, but it is still one of the places you should visit if you're considering to buy something as this is a one stop solution."
,,Best food supermarket ever!,5.0,,"We come here every time we visit Singapore. We occasionally look at the clothes and toiletries departments (the latter being good for local Asian perfumes like jasmine, frangipani etc). But our favourite area is the supermarket!
It is packed full of foods from nearly everywhere in the world, and obviously with a high Asian focus. All very good value too. I could spend all day there, and and always end up taking home great ingredients for future meals."
,,crazy,5.0,,"Being a South Asian (Bangladesh), we have a nature of buying house hold things; And if you are in the same category, Mustafa Center is the place for you, not IKEA; I tried bot the outlet of IKEA in Singapore, they are extremely good at their category. But Mustafa Center has the taste of local finding that you used to get in your home land, in a better price, in a wide range & as well as quality. I repeat, this shop depends on your taste of shopping.
Everything is here, all you need to know the location, otherwise you will lose both time & energy. The sales guys/ladies are helpful except one or two.
My wife does not like it very much mostly because of its crowed, so she used to visit & shop in late night, basically whole night!
I personally feed crazy in Mustafa Center during shopping & buy a lot of thing that sometimes really don’t even needed for me, don’t know why."
,,Everything you need,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is open 24 hours, and contains several floors of clothes, foods, souvenirs, you name it. Prices there TEND to be lower, and the selection of goods are more diverse. Queues can be frighteningly long, so do be aware of when you make your purchases. The place can be cramped as well if its crowded."
,,Dirty and stinky,2.0,,"The bad : The whole place from basement to top floor smells really really really bad. The combo of incense with stale food from the fresh section of the supermart is just pure disgusting.
Nothing looks like it has been wiped . None of their staff know where any of their products are to the point that one might point you to the top floor , while the other , even with the product right under their nose ,will direct you to the next building , 2 floors away . True story btw.

Also , there are plenty of knock offs being sold as real stuff .

The good : open 24 hours"
,,Souvenir shops,5.0,,-A place you can buy cheap souvenirs. -24 hours open even in CNY -Easy access - Lots of chocolates to choose from
,,Lots of things but Disappointed,3.0,,"I had read great things about Mustafa but came away underwhelmed. Yes, there are floors and floors of anything and everything but it is all crammed in and I didn't think the prices were that cheap. I would hate to get stuck inside in an emergency because you would never get out. One good thing no one harassed us to buy anything."
,,Everything Under One Roof for 24hrs,4.0,,"You can get almost everything you need at this place. Might not be be cheapest for the same item or the exact brand but you can find the cheapest of a different brand or model there. You need to be familiar to find the things you need and they are getting better organised. Definitely the place to come in term of urgent needs, like medications."
,,A 'different' retail experience to your typical Singapore shopping centre,3.0,,"Located on Serangoon Road in Little India, a few minutes walk from the Farrer Park MRT station. The Mustafa Centre is more than just a typical shopping mall, it's more of a multi-storey department store, which stocks about everything under the sun. The shelves are overcrowded with products, which sometimes makes it hard to find exactly what you're after. The products aren't particularly high end but there is a lot on offer. The prices are reflect the standard of goods. Open 24hrs but particularly busy between 5-9pm. When I found something I liked it wasn't in the right size or if I found the right size I didn't like the style. It was also hard to find a cashier. I'm a bit undecided on this one. It's a shopping institution in Singapore and definitely a different retail experience than most of the other retail outlets in the city but I don't know if I'd make a special trip just to visit - probably only worth going if you are planning to be in Little India anyway."
,,Amazing 'Department Store' !,4.0,,"This place is huge and I know about big departement stores ! It might seem a bit cheap or cheesy at first but get inside, there is everything you need and more ! Forget about all the Singapore malls that offer the same stores than pretty much everywhere else in the world, and immerge in there for a hour ! Besides finding what you need, you'll get a feel of what (real) Singaporians shop for ! Also get some good local food in the small - not very fancy - canteens around the building."
,,Biggest market place under one roof,5.0,,"Singapore visitors must visit this market during there stay at Singapore. It is located quite near from little India. You will find almost everything right from small pin to anything big that you need except weapons.... Lot of options available for every purchase you think of. So must visit and enjoy shopping..... One more thing, this is the best place to exchange your currency at the best rates. You get the highest exchange benefits than anywhere in Singapore... So you can save much more on exchanging currency. Enjoy........"
,,no more a shopping place for indians,3.0,,Mustafa Centre for Indians is not the same as it used to be in the 1990s. The variety has gone down and prices are comparatively high than prices in the Indian market. It is a waste of time. Mustafa Centre is now for the locals what BIG BAZAR is for indians. In fact now Singapore is a destination for Tourism exclusively. Indians should spend more time in exploring the tourist destinations rather than looking for shopping. same brands and products are much cheaper in India now.
,,"Sells What I Need, at Cheap Price too!",4.0,,"There is always something I would want to buy from this huge center (mall) which sells everything from: bags, suitcases, watches, clocks, clothes, souvenirs, food stuff and so on.

Inside it is always full of people, packed and the paths are narrow that sometimes you bump into other shoppers that you have to squeeze yourself to get to where you want to go.

Finding stuff you want to buy is not easy. Otherwise it is a long long way perhaps at the end of the mall whick takes up two blocks.

Once I picked the stuff, I had trouble finding the cashier, when I did, only to find out that it was closed so I had to find the other ones but with a long queue.

Otherwise I was happy with what I bought: lots of chocolates, sweets, Indian snacks, Indian curry powder or mix, all those mix that you need when cooking Indian dishes - all at very affordable price. To bring home.

I heard that this place is open 24 hours? I went there late in 5he evening, well after 9pm, shopped for 1-2 hours; took a cab to go back to the hotel.

Oh by the way, although Mustafa Center is in Little lndia, the closest MRT station is Farrer Park."
,,Family trip,4.0,,Best market in Singapore here you can get from needles to all valuable items of mostly famous brands of any country and Mustafa was cheap from other markets and quality was superb and main thing was it opened for 24 hours
,,Ordinary things,4.0,,"They have everything you can think of. Open 24/7 and just a quistion about you having the time to find it. The bad thing is, it does not seem to be a red linie in the way they have there produkts so count on seach time
Enjoy"
,,Amazing supermarket! (24/7),5.0,,This is a great supermarket to visit. Very helpful staff and be amazed how big it is. It's of course the place to buy Indian spices and other Indian stuff. The got really everything over here!
,,Indian value shopping,4.0,,If your out looking for a great bargain especially on watches then this is the place to be . Open 24 hours.
,,Value for money,4.0,,"We love the good old Mustafa market place
We visit everytime we are in Singapore
Great place to find great bargains and discounts
We usually go in there for local balms, oils, shoes, knick knacks and everything else

It has turned very crowded and congested over the years.. But still worth a visit"
,,Huge shopping market,4.0,,"The Mustafa Center is located right in Little India and was surprisingly an interesting place to see as a supermarket. If you once go in, you will hardly find out the same way because it is spread over many buildings, sections and floors. If you search for something from soap over shoes to food or electronics, cosmetics and more you will probably find it here at a reasonable/ cheap price (if you can find it). Not comparable to any shops in Europe and just an interesting experience."
,,HUGE!!,4.0,,"I am not a big fan of shopping but this place is an experience and not to be missed. Has absolutely everything and great prices too. It is so big you can easily get lost though, which I did for a short while. Worth it for the experience alone, even if you aren't buying anything."
,,Shoppers Paradise!,5.0,,"Literally all you ever needed or wanted or sought after is in this centre ... medicines and even medical equipment - each staff in each department is knowledgeable about their products but don't ask them about another department. Its mind-blowing how many levels, entrances, escalators, aisles, shop attendants, promoters, cashiers and toilets too are here!
Its all very chaotic and busy despite being open 24/7 so ensure you have plenty of time and patience to cope with the crowds. I would note recommend it for the elderly or children - it can get quite claustrophobic. The jewellery department emphasizes on gold rather than white gold, platinum and silver.
Despite not buying anything, it was certainly a rather over-whelming experience and worth a visit!"
,,KIND OF A CRAZY PLACE,3.0,,"I have been to Singapore 3x and heard about this place but never had a chance to go. It is a 24 hour big, old shopping center. They have almost everything. There are goods section after section on each floor. Its not like separate stores. Its all in one.

I went there 7AM and walked through almost the whole place until 3PM.

They have car parts, toys, electronics, jewelry, groceries, Indian ethnic clothes, shoes, sports gear, you name it.

According to Singapore prices this place maybe considered inexpensive. However, according to US retail prices (Walmart, Costco, KMart, Ross, TJ, Home Goods and similar retail outlets) it is not inexpensive.

You may find a few items more so ethnic or souvenir type that maybe OK prices but some of the brand name items (Im not even sure if they were real or faux) were more expensive than one can find in the States especially in Outlet Malls or deep discounts after the Holiday season.

Majority of the staff are from India. They are not very friendly or customer service oriented. When you ask something they just answer but no smile, no help offering, nothing like that.

If one lives in Singapore, maybe then it's a good place to do some grocery shopping or toys for kids maybe some kitchen gadgets, pots and pans but nothing quality.

Im not sure of their return policies or warranties for electronics, appliances or watches. I personally will not feel comfortable to buy any of those in there even if I live in Singapore.

If you are a 1st time tourist in Singapore w/limited few days, i would not recommend to waste your valuable time in Mustafa Center unless you combine it w/the Little India area tour and some Indian food.

Also buy one of those Indian music CD's that you can do Bollywood dances at home.

If you have extra days or it is your 2nd or 3rd trip to Singapore, sure go spend a few hours walking in Mustafa Center. It will help your daily 10k steps!!!!"
,,Shopping at Mustafa,5.0,,Great place to find absolutely everything!! Mustafa is walking distance from the Little Indian train stations as well
,,Cheap stuffs that you will find nowhere in Singapore,4.0,,"Went inside Mustafa Centre because it started to rain. It was crowded and it was a bit hard to move on the groundfloor especially near the entrance but otherwise, it was a fun shopping experience! Managed to buy some Singapore keychains and chocolates as souvenirs for a bargain."
,,Great place - Dont go with children,4.0,,"This is worth visiting at midnight if you have time on your hands. It has everything....a bit like a multi storey costco but with smaller ceilings and several saftey concerns (ie, railing on step is short on height and can be a saftey hazard, and children can get lost in this maze of a place). We had to ask how to get to the resturant as the signage is not clear and it was other customers who were helpful. Its astonishing at the range they have and the adventure to get it. Some items i would prefer to get elseware as its easier....but overall worth shopping for all the things you need at midnight. Not sure about buying big brands from there as electronics seem similar in cost to Australia. But overall, loved the experience of it."
,,One of the craziest place,5.0,,"This is the one of the craziest place i have ever seen in life.

I don't think so in this shopping centre we will not able to find anything. Over crowded with people and over loaded with goods.

24/7. Very economical. Even brands are also cheap.

This is a one of the famous place in Singapore. People specially came here to see this shopping centre. Its not like other Orchard street malls. But i believe buyers came here more than those malls.

This shopping centre has a restaurant on roof top. I live that restaurant. Indian cosine. 100% Halal."
,,All u can shop is here. 24/7,4.0,,"This is the only plaza, mall, dept store, supermarket, shops, whatever u can name it..open for 24 hours a day in 7 days.

With 6 exit doors extending around 500m and 5-6 floors offering A-Z, I just can't name it one by one. All are fixed price and avoid weekends.
Many prices are discounted or promotion items.MRT DT BLUE LINE exit @ DT 13 Rochor st or DT 12 Little India.

Many Indian & Asian resto foods and retail shops around the area. U could find a good curry & prata resto here."
,,World's largest corner shop,5.0,,"This place must be visited to be believed.
It's huge. Shelves filled with goods with no attempt at aesthetic enhancement or marketing of the goods. People were shopping in masses. It was presented value for money and compared favourably with the glitzy shiny stores in other neighbourhoods of Singapore. It was an excellent show of enterprise and trade that operates 24/7.
Pay it a visit!"
,,It's a shopping experience,4.0,,"Everything conceivable under one roof in little India. Very busy. Good prices. Jewelry, electronics, groceries, sports equipment, spices, clothing etc etc. open 24/7 for 365 days. Worth a visit whilst in Singapore but be patient. You will need it"
,,Amazing range of products,3.0,,Everyone who visits Singapore should come to Mustafa Centre. They have the most extensive range of products. You have to come see it to believe it.
,,Awful Place,1.0,,Terrible place with no customer service. Staff have no desire to help and lack product knowledge. Buyer's beware as the store does not have a return policy should the item you purchase be defective.
,,Mind boggling emporium... the brick and mortar equivalent of amazon.com,4.0,,"I have travelled to many places around the world, this store is mind boggling - you simply have to see Mustafa Centre to believe it!

We stumbled into Mustafa Centre after having dinner in Little India. The sheer variety of its merchandise and the amount of stocks they carry of each genre is just unbelievable. The scale of the store is equally amazing - I gather that they have expanded over time to sprawl over a few buildings and even have a roof top restaurant! The store also has in-house travel agency, barber shop, florist, laundry, pharmacy, etc. The list just goes on and on...

We did not do any shopping, the experience browsing in Mustafa Centre alone was mind boggling. The store is virtually a brick and mortar equivalent of amazon.com and a grand bazaar or old Arabian shoek or SEA central market all rolled into one. The store's customers are equally universal. Besides Indians (naturally), the local Chinese and Malay community also go to Mustafa Centre to shop for anything from staples to the more exotic. And, to top it off, there are many different exotic faces of Singapore's migrant workers and visiting tourists to complete the mix.

I was told the prices here are close to wholesale prices. And, the store is open 24/7.

Would visit again!"
,,24-hour convenience store,5.0,,"All the items needed are on sale here, and is open 24 hours. To be able to here via the MRT down at Farrer Park station and take walk less than 5 minutes. If I usually visit here to buy souvenirs, perfume and electronic goods. But I always buy that is the perfume. Perfume here have to be smart to look who is the promo price. Because there are some perfumes that cost is not much difference price Compared in Jakarta - Indonesia."
,,For Indian travelers - It's a maze of offers,4.0,,"If you like the crowd and best budget shopping then you cannot ignore Mustafa market. You will find all under the same roof - shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, perfumes, food article...you name it and it's there at the best price.

Best place for buying new design jewelry. According to my wife, the designs are new and refreshing so she bought few items...but even without a reason ladies will buy from this place so make sure you carry enough money/plastic.

Foreign travelers should apply for GST refund immediately after buying the article. At the airport you can get the GST refund in cash by showing the goods."
,,Curiosity,3.0,,"If you want a shopping trip with a difference then the Mustangs Centre certainly doesn't disappoint. Floor after floor of everything and anything you could imagine!
Be prepared for strict security when entering, they like to check and seal bags... but don't let it put you off... if anything allow yourself a couple of hours for your visit - you'll need them ;)"
,,Is this store for real??!!,4.0,,"I have travelled to over 40 countries and seen many huge stores like Carrefour, Macy's, Harrod's, Marks and Spencers, Eaton's, Walmarts etc, but this store has to be seen to be believed! Its not because of the size but because of the sheer variety and the amount of stocks they carry! In most stores they will have a few pcs of large items or maybe a few doz of the smaller items on the shelves and floors, but here they will have huge stacks of everything right there and then on display. Its amazing and unbelievable. I have been a supplier of foods and other goods to large supermarkets and stores, but never experienced anything like this!!!!

In fact, their gold jewellery deptt is so heavily stocked with atleast a 100 pcs of each necklace, bracelet, bangles, rings, earrings... etc that its like they have maybe a tons of gold on display! The chains etc are hung on a high wall, its like the entire wall is made of gold 6"" thick.. Suitcases, each model and size you will find 2 doz, watches of each model 2 doz right there, pure ghee - 10 doz of each brand and size on the shelves. You require miles of shelves and millions in money to keep and maintain stocks like these.

And yes, this store stocks from a needle to an elephant literally. Plus they have the shop-in-shop concept taken to a new high! Travel agency, hardware, barber shop, florist, laundry, gardening supplies, restaurant, snack bar, prepared foods... phew, the list goes on. I have been visiting them since the early 2000`s, over the years they have expanded even more dramatically with a new building and roof top restt.

I did not do any shopping there, was only browsing, but what I came to know from diehard locals was you cannot beat the prices here. Even the Chinese, Malays and others come to shop here for staple items. The qtys this store buys are phenomenal so they buy at fabulous wholesale prices.

I can believe many who commented on the poor and lacklustre service, the sales counter staff are swamped with crowds and besides that is typical of Indian attitudes, pricing trumps all else! So do not go expecting a 5 star service or ease of shopping with wide aisles and luxury ambience. This is almost like a wholesale cash & carry, take it and run.

Would love to visit here again!"
,,Round the clock-24/7 shopping destination,4.0,,Centrally located in Little India which is well connected with MRT and bus/taxis. Shoppers'paradise who are really looking for stuffs in a middle range.
,,24/7 shopping!!,5.0,,"Sells all sort of stuffs - electronics, IT, household, clothes, jewellery, toys, games, food, etc. In 2 big buildings with total of 6 levels (including 2 basement levels). It's a shopping paradise!"
,,24 hours shopping of anything,4.0,,"You can find anything you could imagine.
7 floors of products, service and food in a very simple arrangement. Crowd of products and people, on busy days/hours difficult to move around...
Prices in general much cheaper than in any other shopping. You can buy bananas, gold or computers, really unique ..."
,,Where you will find everything!,5.0,,"Mustafa Center is a huge shopping experience. You will find everything you need. Unlimited options with wide range of quality and prices. Grocery, meat, seafood, clothing, electronics, electrical, shoes, Gold, money exchange, travel agent, resturant, herbs, medicine. Be prepared for a big crowd nighttime and weekends. Better if you can go without kids."
,,Not great value,3.0,,"The experience of 24/7 shopping is always fun, and it is hectic. But the pricing has really increased, about 4 years ago it seemed like a bargain paradise, now it is the same price I can get in Australia for many items I wanted. I guess wHat and the internet have liwered prices across the playing field."
,,This place sells everything !!,5.0,,This is a go to place when you need to buy something urgently or have insomnia and want a place to go. Mustaffa also have practically have everything and anything under the sun. It can be quite a crowded place in the weekend and parking can be a nightmare.
,,So much stuff everywhere!,4.0,,"STUFF EVERYWHERE. Opened 24 hours. 8 floors that span for blocks. It’s a superstore that sells anything and everything. From electronics to beauty supplies and household items, jewelry, and even a supermarket! Everything was very discounted too, but that comes with a caveat - a lot of their items are nearing the end of their shelf life, so I would stick to the non perishables here.

It can get a little overwhelming to shop here, and SO easy to get lost, but it is quite the experience!"
,,Too Crowded but filled with varieties.,3.0,,"We visited this mall just out of curiosity, it was too crowded and packed and we ended up buying nothing. It's more or less a supermarket, but has almost everything that's available across all supermarkets in any city in India, a huge variety of things to buy."
,,Too crowded,2.0,,"Crowds have never bothered me. This crowd was too much! I went in the evening, and the outside, street crowds were extraordinarily busy. I could barely walk 3 feet in one direction.

Trying to get into the shopping center was comical. The line was long the inspection was long and once inside I was met by terrible crowds keeping me from walking down aisles in a straight line. Once I bought an item I waited 25 minutes at the cash register. It simply was not worth my time. I would recommend you go at a very odd time in order to enjoy the center. Going at peak shopping hours is ridiculous."
,,Things to do at night,5.0,,"I would suggest that you leave this on the list for something to do at night.
The things there a slighter cheaper then the normal supermarket and you find products that you don't see outside too.
Go on weekdays it's not as pack.
Also bring some tissue paper with you where ever you go. :D"
,,A bit of souvenir hunting,5.0,,We came here as Chinatown was closed. Great for some cheap but good quality souviners and chocolate for the flight home!
,,Adventures in Shopping,4.0,,Mustafa Centre is like a department store in an Indiana Jones movie. Merchandise is packed from floor to ceiling and covers every imaginable subject! Spanish chocolate bars? Yes. Indian Tiffin boxes? Yep. Queen Elizabeth Jubilee Mugs? Of course. I spent hours marveling at the variety.
,,Good to buy chocolates,3.0,,Its not very easily accessible. We took the bus 143 to Serangoon road and then walked it up. Cab ride from Mustafa to hotel chancellor at orchard costed us 16 SGD. You can get wide variety of chocolates and everything else under the sun. Mostly famous for electronics and chocolates. We even exchanged some currency here and got a good rate. The guy at the exchange counter was rude since we spoke in Hindi by mistake. He screamed and said talk in English.
,,Wow what an adventure,4.0,,This store has the most variety of very kind of merchandise. We were there at 10pm and it was busy. All check outs were busy and had long line up. It was an interesting experience in the CENTER of little India. Not sure I would go back except to bring someone there for the experience. Need some shoes fixed or clothing tailored and you will find lots of mini shops that do that. It really felt like you were in India.
,,Bad service,1.0,,"The sales person was very rude, i ask about shoes number he tell me to wait, after 30 minute waiting and he walk away to going home , the price not that cheep for same t shirt as china town sell for s$10 / pc in china town you can get 5 tshirt for the price"
,,Sell defective poducts,1.0,,"I went to Mustafa centre, bought a tennis racket and found it broken.
Unfortunately, I hadn't kept the receipt and they didn’t want to change it with a proper product.
My point is to inform people to beware of the quality of the products sold at Mustafa Centre. Maybe they try to sell defective products expecting to find people in my situation so they can get rid of defective products and don't make losses."
,,I just looked around.....,4.0,,"Located near my hotel, I stopped by this attraction on my way to visit Little India. There are many things to buy! I just looked around and did not buy anything.

Near this attraction is a neighborhood called, Little India where I visited 2 beautiful FREE Hindu temples, shops selling gold, beauty shops, restaurants, etc."
,,Best place for perfumes,3.0,,"This is a huge store, floor upon floor of departments from groceries to electronics to shoes. It's open 24 hours and is operated mostly by Tamils and is in Little India. Go with a nice bag to carry back your stuff. Affordable items for travellers; if you are Indian however, buy select items that you cannot find in India otherwise it is about the same price or more expensive than the same products in big cities in India.

Best things to buy
Perfumes on discount
Seaweed and herbal supplements
Branded products
Creams lotions and shampoos
Shoes"
,,Love.... Hate..,4.0,,"Love the product range, the variety of brands, the smells, the chaotic agreement of product (at times the same product is two or three locations). Love the idea of buying shoes, gold and a kettle in the location.....

But hate the poor service, the grumpy Indian staff and at times the poor hygiene.

But I love it more than not."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Does not look appealing but worth the visit if only to see the place. I have never seen so many items and so much stock! Not just or two of things but 20 of everything.
Yes the place is always busy and crowded. Yes it can be confusing. Yes you do need to know your prices before you go. Yes they do sell everything, we saw one lady buy a wheelchair.
We found most prices to be very good.
It is a good place to see the culture of the local area."
,,Supermarket for all needs,4.0,,"It's Supermarket for all needs (For outsider do carry u r passport in case want to avail GST refund)

1. currency exchange
2. Gold
3. Electronics and perfume
4. Apparel
5. Grocery
6. medicine

In all it's supermarket with all your need. They have 4 story building along with 2 basement which accommodate all product. I wonder how come they stock so many Skus !!!!!.

,,"Day or Night eating, sitting and shopping",4.0,,"The most busy place in the Singapore.There are many peoples come this place over the 24 hours, for his every necessary shopping, meeting place and in the ""Mostafa Cafe"" for verious testy Items."
,,Do NOT go!!! Waste of time!,1.0,,"Very, very bad! Unpleasant experience! Huge waste of time! Dirty, slippery street, bad smells everywhere! The mall is not a mall but indoor market- smelly and overcrowded (lot of screaming children and impolite adults who will bump into you without excuse) . Restaurants (if you can call those places restaurants) do not meet basic hygienic standards and do not have wi-fi. And, when you want to escape you have to stand in a queue for taxi."
,,I'm glad I went there,3.0,,I have to admit I hate shopping. I absolutely loathe shopping. But we decided to go to Mustafa Centre nevertheless. The place is huge and I can imagine a small child easily getting lost in there. The store sells everything from watches to medical equipment to hair clasps to chocolate and appears to also have a supermarket in the middle. I found the amount of goods and shoppers overwhelming. I think you really have to know your prices before you go in there because I don't think that the big brands are necessarily that cheap. I'm glad I visited the Mustafa Centre because I had heard a lot about it but I was happy to go to another shopping complex a couple of blocks away which was more organised and less chaotic.
,,Huge and crowded,4.0,,"The place is huge.. sells everything that you can think of. Its easy to get lost in the Mustafa shopping complex. I saw a dress one day and thought will buy it next day when I come back with my husband; but we spent 45 min only finding the place where I went earlier.. We found luggage priced very reasonably compared to India; and many varieties too. Since we were staying right next to it at Parkroyal, we took juices/ snacks from Mustafa every once in a while."
,,Good place to explore,4.0,,This is the only place in Singapore open 24 hours so anytime one can go and explore and find many items on reasonable price. The only thing which I didn't like was the space in between various sections and crowd to accommodate within it so it becomes very difficult to shop
,,Massive...,4.0,,"You can easily get lost inside. It is a giant retail labyrinth, which stocks practically everything under the sun except alcohol.

Situated right in the heart of Little India, this place should not be given a miss. Great place for deal hunting. Just be sure you know exactly were to go. Else, you are going to have a pair of really sour feet by the end of it."
,,Biggest Shopping Mall in Singapore,5.0,,"This mall is biggest in Singapore. you can get everything here at good cost. This mall open 24 hours for the service, so you can shopping here at any time at your convenient time."
,,excellent place,5.0,,"shopping was awesome! I have my last minute shopping here, 24 hours shopping area with everything, as in everything from electronics to souvenir to food and chocolates! very near to my hotel parc sovereign"
,,Big but congested Mall,4.0,,This mall or shopping center is very big with floors one above the other. But it is very congested. It has all the things you want.
,,Big Shopping Centre,3.0,,24hours open that a good thing here. You can find anything here but So many people here. super crowded.
,,One of. A kind,5.0,,"This shopping factory(or paradise)is one of a kind.All your needs in one place""everything including the kitchen sink"".You need not go further for all your shopping needs while in Sigapore"
,,Average mall,3.0,,"visited to exploer shopping, did not find much exciting, more similar to indian malls like big bazaar or D mart, it's open 24 X 7"
,,Best shopping centre,5.0,,"Mustafa Centre Is best shopping centre in Singapore. 24hours open, then what else you want. Prices are also very reasonable. Everything under one Roof!! Best location. Love to visit everytime when in Singapore"
,,Giant shopping centre,4.0,,"Its a giant shopping centre with 5 huge buildings. Its hard to explain how products are displayed there feels like they have been thrown and not staged properly. It needs atleast one whole day to have a look around in this place and later you can finalise what to buy. Cosmetics, clothes, toys, food, electronics, watches and almost everything is available in this centre. Not all products are original there but are copy like Gucci purses etc. Most amazing part is everyone was anonymously using perfumes and going forward and no one was buying them."
,,Selying duplicate items,1.0,,"I was an ex Permanent resident of Singapore, while I am leaving a Tissot watch from Musthafa center in 2015, last month it was having some problems and I went to the service center in my state and they told it is not an original Tissot watch. The money I spent to buy it was in vain now. So please not you can buy anything from there except branded products,"
,,Massive Shopping Mall,2.0,,"Don't get me wrong this place has a lot of stuff at decent prices, But there is a huge downside - the customer service, or should I say lack there of. I asked one lady if she could find my shoe size for a pair that I really wanted, she proceeded to angrily point at some boxes which I presume may have had my size and walked off. I saw her later pretending to stake shoes, it's like wow you have really checked out. But she wasn't alone the next 3 customer to retailer interaction were just as unpleasant. My advise for tourist who come here 'your on your own'."
,,Amazing shopping,4.0,,Mustafa is one of the places where you can find just about anything. It is big. Shelves are packed with stuff. A must see for tourist short of time as it is a one stop place to shop. All sorts of provisions / electronic stuff / cosmetics / herbal vitamins etc. Prices are reasonable to cheap.
,,One of the best place to shop in Singapore,4.0,,"Mustafa has been my favourite shopping area ever since i started working 10 years ago.

It has almost anything that you'd need - though not the best quality of things, but the wide selection makes it easy to shop for anything that you fancy.

Money changer is excellent as well - with one of the best rates in town.

The ideal place for last minute shopping, money changing and even India visa application!

Tip: Come here for its perfume deals!"
,,Gigantic,5.0,,"They have virtually everything. From cars to groceries, jewellery and shoes, electronics and everything in between. Most of it is open really late in case you have an emergency, like we did in forgetting an electronic device at home. All air conditioned. Multiple levels, and absolutely huge, approx 10 football fields worth of jam packed shelves. It is a mind blowing shop.

It was too busy for us to spend an extended period of time there. But because of the efficient layout we were able to find what we wanted very quickly, pay for it quickly, and get out of there quickly too.

You have to see this place to believe it"
,,A shoppers paradise,5.0,,Open 24 hours and head to local shopping if you are in short transit Too many brands and goods stocked for shopping pleasure Experience shopping at midnight and rewind the weekend
,,VERY GOOD SHOPPING MALL,4.0,,"Very Much Nice SHOPPING MALL Which is opened 24/7 & U can get all items you want such branded watches,clothes & Indian items you can little bit high price.."
,,Pocket Friendly,5.0,,Mustafa Centre is popular with tourists and locals to buy stuff. It is located near little india and has everything you could buy at a nominal rate. It also has currency exchange counters located outside the mall which provides good rate.
,,24/7 shopping mall in Singapore,4.0,,"This Shopping Mall is located near to Farrer Park MRT. Car park is available inside the mall but quite small. Street parking is available. You could say one stop shopping mall since it's available all the products. But some branded items are not available there. I would give 5stars if the staff is kind & friendly to talk. For eg. this is not good to say to customers who are buying exp items like ""This is the last piece. If u like it, take it. If not, leave it."" Nobody will buy even how They like it. Apart of staff behaviors, everything is perfect."
,,An amazing place to shop,4.0,,"This place is packed full of stuff, could possible have everything under the one roof over several floors. Try not to think of the environmental impact of so much junk. This time we were looking for indian clothes to dress up for a party, not a lot of staff to assist but managed to find what we were looking for at very reasonable prices."
,,One stop shopping haven,5.0,,"It's a 24-hr shopping complex with a lot of choices of everything under the sun. It's a 2-building complex that's connected together, but don't expect the place to be posh or fancy. Like a typical store, each floor has a different category, but the thing about Mustafa is it seems like they don't have a storage area so everything is just out there for you to browse. They're organized into categories yes, but because everything is just out there and it's a huge place, it's difficult to go back to something you wanted to go back to. So if you saw something you're interested in, just grab it and drop it later if you decide not to take it. Asking the staff won't do you any good. Even them don't know where things are.

Everything is cheap and there are a lot of things that are difficult to find. So many to choose from. It gets crowded so I suggest do your shopping at night like 10 or 11 PM types. They have a huge collection of good quality jewelries which I didn't expect as the area is kinda sketchy.

If you like doing groceries or browsing through a lot of goods, don't miss this on your SG trip."
,,Amazing. Everything under the sun.,5.0,,"Is there anything you can't get here? It has everything under the sun. A little haphazard at some parts, but therein lies the fun of the browsing."
,,Everything under one roof,5.0,,"If your main agenda in Singapore is shopping, do not miss place. You name it and they have it here: gold jewelry , watches, electronics, electrical, souvenirs, grocery, vegetables, clothes, luggage, shoes, currency exchange, chocolates, perfume, cosmetics, medicines....you name and they have it. Prices are lower than elsewhere as they stock everything in bulk. Goods are closely stacked and so it can get crowded, chaotic and claustrophobic. Salesmen are indifferent and arrogant but you up with it due to the lower prices."
,,Huge shopping complex,4.0,,"If you are looking for some gifts for family and friends you can find wide variety of stuff like electronic goods, watches, bags, candies, chocolates, cosmetics, perfumes and much more if you have time and stamina to browse all sections of the store. It's near Little India and opens 24x7. It's quite popular with both locals and tourist. Money ex-changer is in house."
,,If you're in the neighborhood......,2.0,,"I headed to the Mustafa Centre expecting to get my hands on some clothing and footwear bargains. While 'bargains' were pretty much non-existent (packet of sports socks x 3 = SGD $12.00) it's worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood, otherwise I wouldn't bother."
,,Unbelievable but not necessary!,3.0,,"We went just to see it for ourselves. Also my wife was looking for fabric. I would agree with others, don't go on weekend. We went Monday night and it was crowded enough. There are no bargains however if it is made and sold this place has it. It is in little India section of town. Also found the employees unhelpful. Didn't seem to care if you bought anything or not. Spend your time elsewhere."
,,"Utterly chaotic, Super sized.",3.0,,"If you need an item if pretty much any description you will probably find it in this place. Busy in the extreme and laid out with seeking little logic. No premium products here buy I got a couple of well made shirts in suitably large westerner sizes (up to 6XL on the label, I bought 3XL that fit well when ask of my Aussie shirts are 2XL) No brands like Chanel etc, but some of the mid range brands of cosmetics are here are good prices. Not what I would call a pleasant shopping experience."
,,Sells Everything,4.0,,"Went to Mustafa's in late October 2016. Yes, it gets very crowded and it seems everyone from locals to tourists shop there! From watches to biscuits you will find it here. I didn't buy a lot here but what I purchased was very good. For instance I had been looking for a certain type of table runner for over 12 months at home and finally found it at Mustafa's! It is beautiful heavy fabric with thick gold tassels and is two meters long. In Australia I would have paid around $200 IF I ever found anything like it. So at $26.90 Sg I was very happy. I think that if they had chairs for people to rest for a while people would stay longer. Not one chair! However the cashier kindly put a chair there for me from behind her desk. I wish I had purchased a couple of those runners now!!!"
,,Chaotic shop,4.0,,"The Mustafa centre has a broad range of quality products for sale at good prices.
However it is very busy and has narrow isles leading to a very chaotic feel, my kids couldn't handle it so we had to leave after 30 minutes.
We went on a week night and have been told to avoid it at all costs on sundays."
,,Shopping Expedition,3.0,,"Massive shopping centre with 3 levels and 2 basement levels.
Everything available from medicine to hi fi needs and souvenir key rings.
Example of pricing Adidas sneakers were about $70 while Nikes were about $120 with a 20% discount for Nikes.
Some great buys for clothing and sneakers but limited to smaller sizes.
Watches were a decent price as well but double check as some had no warranties while some had the 2 year international warranties covering them.
You are also able to claim back your tourist refund to claim at airport so make sure take your passport if you plan on doing a fair bit of shopping."
,,There are no words.....,5.0,,"I don't even know where to begin reviewing the Mustafa Centre; it's unique, crazy and the sort of place where you pop in to have a look and end up spending 4 hours! To start with it sells everything and I mean everything. Watches, groceries, hugely expensive gold jewellery, clothes, electronics, shoes, bags, perfume, rugs, household goods - the list is endless. If you want it you can find it here. It's arranged over umpteen floors and just when you think you've seen everything you find the new extension which houses more of the stuff you've just looked at! It's immense and awesome and a fantastic place to kill a few hours that you weren't intending on killing. If you get hungry the Curries and Kebabs restaurant on the roof of the extension is excellent and fairly cheap. A buffet lunch with a bottle of water cost about £13. A must do for any visitor who likes shopping and anyone who likes looking at food will love the vast supermarket floor. I've never seen so many types of rice in my life!"
,,Weird place,4.0,,"Its so huge, trust me, i've never seen anythng like that, It seems like it takes forever to walk thru everything and after a while you head stars to hurt, because there are so many thing from so many coutries. We were joking that it seems like purgatory with no end and i think its kinda true. There are cheap orginal perfumes and cosmetics. Everything is slighty cheaper than in normal shop."
,,top indian market in singapore,5.0,,its a three big store seems a three mall.you can get all very resonable price food cloth electronics gold or any thing you thing of it can get here.open 24 hours too.
,,Huge,2.0,,This place is massive. Filled with cheap junk. Worth one look. Not sure I'd go back. Plenty of souvenirs.
,,"Hectic, Bizarre & Interesting!",4.0,,"Shopping: One building that contains floors of absolutely everything. Expect close proximities of people scrambling around shopping for all sorts of random products! Good place to buy food souvenirs!

Location: Inbetween Little India & Farrer Park MRT station. Recommend getting off at Little India then walking along the famous Serangoon Road (the high street of Little India).

Key Takeaway: Highly recommend if you are in Little India! True taste of local Indians in their life in Singapore!"
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,This place has everything under one roof... You can shop till you drop The area around is little India with awesome food.
,,Busy Place,5.0,,"this area is very busy within 24 hours.

,,Just mind boggling!,5.0,,"You name it , you get it here. Perfumes are quite cheap. Luggage bags are cheaper. Electronics. If you are tourists, you can cal GST refund while leaving Singapore at the airport."
,,Its a shopper paradise or a nightmare,4.0,,"There is so much stuff crammed into this shopping complex. Do not expect much order or logic, but if you are looking for it, it will be somewhere there. for example, there are racks and racks of men's shirts, and the same goes for whatever you are seeking, quality, I do not know, I recognized a number of brands but other brands were just unknown.

To drop into Mustafa Centre is quite easy as its midway between Little India and Farrer Park MRT stations, and the walk in between takes in a lot of Little India."
,,"Unique, bizarre and great!",4.0,,"Can't recommend for eating, but could spend hours shopping. Mustafas appears to be a Singapore institution, open 24 hours a day. If you want something, Mustafas will probably have it - souvenirs, food, sweets, electricals - you name it...! We'll be back!"
,,This place is huge!!,4.0,,"Yep, they have just about everything. I don't think I've ever seen so many different types of rice, bread, spices...the list goes on! Interestingly they put a zip tie on the inside sleeve of my backpack so I guess I couldn't do free shopping! They put it on pretty tight so I had to get them to cut it off after we had finished shopping. There are also security guards on the doors that will direct you to the zip tie ladies. Had a great time browsing and shopping but the isles are narrow and there are lots of shoppers so you'll need a bit of patience."
,,A to Z shop of Singapore. Lot of crowd,4.0,,A to Z shop of Singapore. Lot of crowd even in the mid night. 24 hours shop. Avoid sundays. you will have lot of indian restaruant near this mall. worth the visit.
,,Open 24 hour,4.0,,"If you don't know where to go in the middle of the night go to Mustafa center and you will find things that you are not thinking to be here
All electronics , cosmotic and complete hypermarket with 3 buildings and 6 floor
Enjoy but you should avoid in Sunday"
,,Everything in one place,5.0,,This is a place which is most related to indian touch. You can buy almost everything in this place for a cheap price. Chocolates are very cheap in this place. And the gold also.
,,Poor Service,3.0,,"This is a large shopping mall with a vast array of products, probably one of the largest Chemists I have come across. We spent some time wandering around here and looked at a few items that we might have purchased if we were able to get service from disinterested service people, perhaps we were aussie's and not indian, I don't know."
,,Great Place to buy anything which exists in this world,5.0,,"This place is great for locals and expatriates as it has everything under one roof. Don't expect great service or any help from staff, however rest assured you can find anything you are looking for at a good price. Try the roof top restaurant at night, which is a must if you visit Mustafa centre. This place is open 24 hours, so you can shop till you drop."
,,Very crowded on weekends,2.0,,"Its a popular mall in Little india, mainly catering to Indian tourists. The place is very crowded on weekends and we found it tough to maneuver through the streets in between the people. The shop is like a large supermarket, don't expect it like a glitzy mall. The aisles are narrow and stuff they sell can't be said very cheap. We went had a look and hurried outside."
,,Anything you need is in here,5.0,,"Definitely best choice for one who on low budget,anything you need,they're all have,the path between shelves is quite narrow but it's not a problem."
,,Shop round the clock,5.0,,This is a 24/7 round the year shopping centre. You get the great products at a cheap and affordable price in Singapore.
,,"Need something, anything - it is here...",5.0,,"The little secret of Singapore…Mustafa Centre. We’ve been here a few times and always come away with more than we intend to buy, that’s because there is soooooo very much to buy, for all ages. Last time was a suitcase, clothes and perfume. If you want something or need to buy something cheaper than retail this is where you’ll find it…."
,,"Food, medical supplies, electronics...all in 1 place",5.0,,"Loved this mall. It's very big and has almost everything (no gel polish though) haha.

The grocery store was amazing. Stocked up on yummy spices, black bean sauce (who knew some other parts of Asia don't have this sauce), and chai tea! Good prices for the most part. Some things are cheaper to buy in China town like tiger balm."
,,Affordable Shopping Place,5.0,,"I love buying perfumes here as they are cheap compared to other shops and they have a wide range of selections. Plus, they always have promotions. If you're a tourist, don't forget to ask for a tax refund. They have a counter to cater for that"
,,Shopping,4.0,,"A very iconic giant Indian shopping mall where all manner of goods may be found, from fresh produce to gold jewellery!
Money changing is available. It is open 24 hours a day, hence you can go anytime. However avoid weekends when thousands of shoppers will crowd the streets around the mall. In the daytime the surrounds are interesting as well with many Indian shops selling flowers, spices and fruits. You could easily spend half a day wandering and soaking in the atmosphere of Little India in Singapore."
,,Explore the chaos !!,5.0,,"Mustafa is a fascinating place where you can find almost anything!!! I was up to my friend's challenge of 'ask me to find something'. I said 'shower head'. Lo and behold, there were shower heads, although not the brand or type I was looking for.

I mainly go there to look for value priced electronic goods. My popular buys are mobiles and watches. More recently, I stumbled into the fabrics section, which had some pretty nice non-sari selections. I have also of late explored their jewellery. I had bought a pair of earrings in a hurry and to my horror when I tried them on at home, found that the studs were too thick for me. They were really nice to allow me to exchange, with receipt proof that I bought them a few days earlier. The sales person educated me 'you must buy earrings for non Indian ears'. Ah! I learnt my lesson that the Indian community do tend to have bigger ear lobe piercings, given their bigger, ornate and beautiful jewellery earrings. After some recommendations, I was happy to find a replacement pair that could fit me.

In the first instance, one may find that the service may leave much to be desired but I have discovered that once we overcome the first encounter, the staff are really friendly and helpful. Also, the place may sometimes be messy but that is the fun of discovery at Mustafa's!!! Love it!"
,,Not cheap,3.0,,"Ts a 24x7 mall.. Dats d main advantage. Vaast amount to select from, dats d second.. But don't let dese two trick u, d place s not a cheap street market. For tourists, Singapore s expensive compared to Malaysia n Thailand, n mustafa keeps up wit singapore.. D products r quite expensive. But u Ve a large array to choose from, dats a plus.. Chocolates, I felt r reasonably priced. Clothes on d other, r high priced, even d mediocre ones. D regular stuffs lik school stuffs etc r also reasonable.. D souvenirs however r definitely over d top.. U can see d same merlion statues n Keychains being sold @ really low prices in d shops across mustafa. Another downside s d attitude of d salespeople.

Verdict : vast selection, especially for household items; not cheap;anytime shopping."
,,Crowded but you can get most everything there,4.0,,Great place for cheap shopping from clothes to electronics to food..everything under 1 roof. Go late after 10pm for less crowds and never go on Sat and Sun during the day...its a mad house too too crowded.
,,Pharmacy 24x7,5.0,,The best thing I would like to mention about this place is having Pharmacy section in the mall. You can get all kinds of medicine by 24x7. The pharmacist was kind and given exact tablets for diarrhea.
,,"Crazy, well priced, reputable",4.0,,"If you can handle the frenetic energy of Little India, the walk to this centre is worthwhile for staples and money exchange."
,,Maze of Amazement,5.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a maze for first time visitors. A range of consumer goods & FMCG's at stellar prices is their USP. Their service staff looks disinterested but its the sheer variety of brands & goods that you want to visit this 24x7 gem for. Not exactly a tourist attraction, but a great place for a midnight grocery run. This place is full of energy & surprises. It's huggge so don't lose your way or your patience."
,,Huge shopping mall in Little India,4.0,,"They have everything you need and don't need. Bring some time as this mall is HUGE and absolutely confusing. If you live in Singapore it is definitely worth a visit for cheap cosmetics, shampoos, medication, electronics, household items, etc. Gets very crowded though. Open 24 hours. Just across the street from the City Square Mall and an easy walk from MRT station Farrer Park (NE7)."
,,Open 24 hours shopping centre,3.0,,"Big shopping centre but unlike upscale shopping malls. Narrow alleys, crowded and mostly attractive to Indian and Chinese people looking for bargains. If your luck is shining, you can find good bargains."
,,Not worth it.,1.0,,"When it comes to buying pasalubong items, this place is expensive. if you want to buy chocolates or food items its better to buy in groceries. if you want key chains better you buy in Chinatown."
,,big shopping mall,5.0,,we visit singapore last year with my friends we visit mustafa the is very big mall and economy price the is mall open 24 hours
,,Overpriced and Unfriendly,3.0,,"This huge complex, although open all hours is not friendly. Lots of goods for sale, but overpriced. The Centre staff are disinterested and not helpful, there are many shopping options in Singapore, this is not my favourite."
,,expectations were higher,3.0,,"its the third time that we have been in singapore
i went to mustafa on 1st time that i went to singapore but didnt have time to review this
you could find anything and everything in mustafa shopping mall
but don't expect it to be cheaper
because its not
you could find some perfumes and other things for cheap but other than that everything is average price"
,,A crowded place,3.0,,"This is a 24 hr open shopping mall, where u can get anything from items for cooking, to electronics to gold! All under one roof. I felt it's bit cramped for space and gets crowded too. It's so big that lack of place to sit for few minutes, hurts. If u need anything anytime and cheaply, Mustafa Center is the place. Cannot comment on the quality though."
,,Must visit in night,4.0,,"Mustard center is so big----------- you can find Bread to electronics to gold--------- & lots o things Can say everything, but best part is timing that is 24 hours. Chocolate, dry fruits,& juices, very good choice with Comfortable prices. Find may brand products."
,,Shopping at night,4.0,,"Wanna buy a computer at 4am in the morning?
You can.
Mustafa is Singapore's 24hr shopping centre.
Nightbirds love this place cos it's quieter at night.
Just for the fun of it, and to see hownsafe it is in Singapore, walk in to Mustafa for a look-see.
Quiet a shopper paradise. Or just window shopping is fine. No pushy staff here."
,,"Gadget, cheap accessories",4.0,,"A must go to place if you love your gadgets, electronic stuff, computers etc. Loads of cheap stuff if you know how to bargain."
,,Not a must visit mall!,3.0,,"It has got everything and anything if you are looking for quality products at reasonable price, unfortunately this is not the place!"
,,Best place for shopping at Singapore,5.0,,It's big so you will get everything you need. Electronics products prices are very high in Singapore but still you will find some useful products there. Budget at least 2 hours to explore every section.
,,Got everything you need or want,4.0,,"This shopping centre has everything you could think of, and a lot of it.yes I agree the prices are not as cheap as some other countries , depending on what your buying. I managed to save $6 bucks on some crocs shoes example $28 compared to $34 at home on special. So still a saving. Other sports shoes and electronic gear more not. So have to pick your bargain and compare. Well worth a visit though. Start bottom and end to end to top."
,,Open 24 hours,4.0,,"The nice thing in Mustafa are open for 24 hours. So if you wanna less crowded come late nite or early morning, They sell a lot of stuff and pretty huge supermarket. The price are almost the same and you can have a tax free."
,,What to buy,4.0,,"Visited this grand shopping centre in first week of September. The first section closes by 2245, others are open 24/7.
Bought many perfumes, a gold chain, chocolates and some luggage items. Perfumes are dirt cheap. For eg burberry classic for men 2x100ml bottles at 90SGD. Generally prices are 2x30ml>30-40SGD, 2x50ml>50-60SGD, 2x100ml>90-100SGD. Simple gold jewellery don't have making charges, others have making charges. Worth to buy chocolates for gifting. Nothing else is cheap. U pay 7% tax which comprises 5.5%GST and 1.5% service tax. 5.5% GST is refunded for the items that u are taking back with you. GST refund process is very simple. There are different sections and each section has got its own display of clothes, grocery, electronics, perfumes, toys etc."
,,Everything is here,4.0,,It's the biggest supermarket I have ever seen with endless choices. Sad to say I was looking for low calorie salad dressing and they only had one choice. The mind boggles at the other choices. Very crowded. Much more then just the huge supermarket which is included in the building. Anything you want. They have it.
,,They really have a lot!!,4.0,,Mustafa Centre is a nice experience to stroll endlessly through a building with almost everything. You can get the feeling you are lost. They have so many different products in many small 'stalls' within a large building. It is just an experience without buying anything.
,,Not that cheap,3.0,,"We were there to looking for some souvenir for family and we ended up with some chocolate boxes, and other available in reasonable price such as perfume the place itself is huge and a lot of stuff however there is no place to sit after shopping."
,,Expectations were high,2.0,,You have to see it if you have too much time in Singapore but if not than leave it. Been there but can't what is all the fuss about.
,,Almost everything is here,3.0,,"Good place to get your currency exchanged and buy souvenirs. The place is a huge supermarket. If you want to buy chocolates as souvenirs, you could buy a lot here for a good price. Other than that, it's more of a supermarket for locals. There are electronics and gadgets there if you want to buy. There's a food place outside Mustafa if you're hungry."
,,Large supermarket,3.0,,"It is just like a large local supermarket. Looks like you can find anything at this place.
But imho, if your target to find electronics and gadgets then you'll find so many choices at this place, but if fashion stuffs, then don't bother to come to this place."
,,Didn't live up to the hype,3.0,,"This place was a ""must-visit"" destination on our trip....unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations. There just seemed to be a lot of junk brands...mixed in with some name brands and all at prices that could not be considered bargains.
It wasn't a great experience.....there are many better ways to spend your time (and money) in Singapore."
,,An adventure,5.0,,A relly nice place for shopping in Singapore. Prices are not very cheap however. But nevertheless it is a shopper's paradise
,,A Real Adventure,5.0,,"Went to mustafa's in july it is my 3rd visit, and I just love it .I have read reviews about it being crowded but if you go early on a sunday you nearly have the place to yourself .Mustafas is open 24 hrs so there are times it can be very crowded ,like on a saturday I went in then and you could not move with people it is a awesome place to shop and quite an adventure just pick the right time on Mustafas website they have a gragh which tells you the busies and the slows times off day to shop."
,,For the locals,3.0,,"This is not a place i would recommend for young couples, it is mainly shopping for the locals and stocks food, toiletries, kitchen ware etc; but if you are after something for your short stay which is likely extortionately priced to buy from the Ion then this is the place to come."
,,Good place for selection; bad place for customer experience,1.0,,"They just don't know how to treat customers inside the store. The selection is great without doubt, but the treatment meted out to customer is pathetic to poor. There are literally no chairs to sit in the entire store which makes it difficult to shop for long hours especially elderly people.
Salespeople treat have no clue what they are selling and they cross all limits to mistreat you especially if you happen to be an Indian. Avoid it like a plague if you are an Indian. Don't let these dolts treat you like badly and take you for a ride"
,,Grand Shopping Experience,4.0,,You can find almost everywhere. It is one of the biggest shopping hub of Singapore. Do pay visit for great discounts and variety.
,,Huuuuge mall!,4.0,,"You can find everything here!
Jet Lagged? U can go here as they are open 24hours! They offer everything, From batteries to pasalubong at lower price than malls.
I went here to search for costume for my daughter. They have those too. Went on a sunday so loooong lines at the check out counter.
I will go back here again and do some major cosmetic shopping. I regret not buying the kerastase oleo relax serum. Super cheap!!
They also offer big discounts on perfumes.

Best to leave the kids at the hotel if ur going here. Also do not carry big bags. If you have a wallet on chain or a cross body bag, please opt to use that!
worth the trip. I hope though that there would be a lot of taxi coz flagging one down is very very hard. There is a near taxi bay, though i wouldn't recommend walking there if u will be visiting 10pm onwards :)"
,,A huge Mall,3.0,,"Mustafa centre is in little India and if huge with almost everything inside; from designer bags to groceries.

Although it maybe a good place for the locals but as a tourist it was okayish for us. We heard about it a lot from the Taxi drivers so went there to see.

It is 24 hours so better to visit late at night as it was quite packed even at 10 pm and we've heard that on weekends it's super busy.

There are small shops opposite it who have cheap souvenirs and this street has a lot of Halal options."
,,What on earth makes them perfect place to shop,5.0,,"If you are looking for Indian products with reasonable cost, then this is the ideal place for you to shop. 24 hours open to customers, what else you can expect. Everything under one roof and shop till your feet asks you to rest. Avoid shopping on weekends, as it is packed and you may not be able to shop properly. I have been visiting this place for the last 09 years and every year it grows leaps and bounds."
,,Excellent,5.0,,You can buy anything you want from here ! Just anything ! Shopping centre is huge ! Jewellery Superb ! They offer Gst refund too for tourists ! !
,,here you can find everything,4.0,,"one of my two favorite malls in singapore.
not fancy and you might need some time to find what you want but it is worth a visit.
huge variety of goods.
try to avoid evening time because then it might become very crowded.
open 24 hours!"
,,Highly hyped,3.0,,"Everyone recommends a stop here and talks about great shopping experience. I had a very contrary experience. Their prices are not really lowest. If you visit USA frequently, do not bother to shop here. The food was not great too. I did not find staff very co-operative.
I must admit though that you may find everything you are looking for under one roof."
,,Amazing stuff,5.0,,"guys its like good place to buy, good stuff is there. not much expensive. whatever you want, trust me it's there. no need to go anywhere else."
,,Mustafa Centre - A Little India bazaar,4.0,,"I done a lots of shopping here for friends as i am first time here in singapore. U will find all things like electronics, cutlary, bags, jwellery, food, rocessary, jwellery under single roof which is opened 24*7 hr and you can enjoy indian foods outside. There is a temple and Mosque nearby and Currency exchange - U will get best price for Dollar conversion here. This is connected with MRT and you can come here any time."
,,Ok but prices are similar to the uk,3.0,,"We visited this place over 15 years ago and decided to return again. It's a huge shop and we'll known in Singapore. It sells about everything for a household. However this time we found the price of most items to be similar to the UK, if not more, so really no point in buying anything. The Resturant was also overpriced for tea and drinks. Nice to see but doubt I will come again."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"If you are in the shopping mood, this is a great place to try. not expensive and they have everything. Love it Thanks Moshe"
,,Mustafa Centre @ Singapore,4.0,,Mustafa Centre is like a supermarket - very large and covers most stuff that people would want to purchase right from electronics to food to accessories. Good place for both locals and tourists to shop.
,,Best Hypermarket I have ever seen,5.0,,"Mustaffa means everything what you need in Sin gapore.
This multi storey hypermarket is one of the best buying place in Singapore. Be it grocessary, jwellery, food, medicines,electronics, cutlary, bags, eatary, restaurant and many more.
Mustaffa offers almost everything you need.
Located near Serangoon road on Syed Alwi road this place is also must visit place either for tourists or for locals.
But one thing this is not the cheapest one Singapore although you will get everything under one roof.
Kababs and curries restaurant on 7th floor is not that good."
,,Shop here irrespective of time.,5.0,,Mustaffa is a single store in singapore where u can get all itemsrting from pen to perfume.... A to z and u find offers on selected items and the best part is 24/7 working.... More convenient to ladies wiyh kids.. Put them to sleep leave them with anyone at home and njoy shopping.....
,,So much to buy,4.0,,"Looking for anything? You can buy anything and everything at Mustafa - a HUGE selection of watches, cameras, clothes...the list goes on. The Centre runs over at least 3 large blocks, which you don't realise once you are inside the building.
Upstairs the grocery supermarket is enormous with a very good selection. Prices are comparable to other places, so don't expect things to be much cheaper, but certainly worth a visit."
,,Great selection 24/7 and good prices,5.0,,"What else can one say about Mustafa!! I've been here for 20 years and seen it grew and grew, for the better, not the best prices but reasonable prices if you compare around town. The selection however is amazing and gives everyone a run for your money. I find they have more type of dates/figs dried fruits than anyone in Singapore. They even have good cheeses and chocolates etc. They make the little India area comes alive for me. Most of the restaurants around survives because of Mustafa. My visits are almost always after my work hours for supper and some quick purchases."
,,Super Duper under one roof,5.0,,"Everything in these huge building just prepare yr $$$, shopping till drop 24 hours and all are Original guarantee product and warranty try avoid Sunday so crowded"
,,Over the top,5.0,,"Mustafa center is a little of the beaten track, and you might not think to go in. But DO! This is the most extreme and hilarious example of consumerism I have ever encountered. The sell EVERYTHING, the different stories sell different things, and the shelves are literally booming, not a thing could be added.... There is almost no room for the shoppers. But it is amazing and fun.... I always return."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,Chocolates and Perfume cheaper compared to Singapore DFS. Only sad part is GsT refund applicable only if purchase above 100 SGD. Exchange rate at Mustafa is very competitive.
,,An attraction or a shop?,5.0,,"Mustaphas must be seen to be believed. This shop is endless, good value, well stocked and probably breaks all the rules of western retailing - thankfully!
An amazing Aladdins cave of everything and open 24 hours. I always visit when in Singapore simply to soak up the manic atmosphere."
,,24 hr shopping center,4.0,,This shopping center located not far enough to farrer Park mrt station. Any kind of Singapore souvenir can we buy in here.
,,A mad shop with everything in it,3.0,,"This shop goes on and on...taking up one whole side of the road with at least 5 levels of shopping.
Prices are pretty good and they have souvenirs on top of everything else. But, stuff is badly mixed together. For example, I saw souvenir fridge magnets on three different (but not adjacent) aisles.
The aisles are pretty narrow and loads of people just stop and chat wherever so it can be awkward to navigate.
If that doesn't put you off, they have loads of just about everything. There must have been at least 6 aisles of backpacks and their watch section is immense."
,,Great Departmental store,4.0,,Great store in little India and we bought some gifts.. Whole lot of goods ..You can find anything from a needle to car -all under one roof..
,,Great Shopping 24 x 7 in Little India,5.0,,"I visited Singapore on business in June 2016. My wife, son and daughter joined me. The Mustafa Center in Little India is open 24 by 7. It has fantastic shopping. I bought some USB storage devices for a very good price. Try not to go here on Sunday when it is jammed-packed with local Singaporean Indians on their day off. You can easily spend a couple of hours here looking around. You can get out at the Little India MRT stop and walk 15 minutes or so on Serangoon Road to get here."
,,Very Reasonably Priced...Best to shop at night - open 24hrs,4.0,,A supermarket in the mittle of little India...extremely well priced...bought original branded perdumes like mont blanc and dkny for about 50% lesser than the singapore duty free...when i saw the prices at duty free i felt bad for not purchasing more perfumes....place is open 24 hours...best to shop at night as there is less crowd...the isles are very small...if you are a tourist do not forget the GST return...once you are done shopping pay at the cashier and inform that you want to claim GST..they would ask you to go to the basement counter to get a slip which u could show at the airport and get a % of tax back...valid only for purchases of 100 dollars and only for products which have gst added such as perfumes
,,Shopping mania,4.0,,"Me and my wife went there for shopping time. The veriety of stuf to buy is huge. You can find there everything and anything. The prices are ok, not too high. However, it is not always organized well."
,,One stop shopping,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a one stop shop for all your shopping needs, Basement floors for Indian saris and salwar chemises. I thought it would be a shopping centre with a variety of shops, but actually it was one large shop on many floors. Gold shop on ground floor one side has excellent variety but not service not as good as the smaller shops along the street. Nice cheap outdoor eating at ground level too , $1.50 masala tea delicious. If you spend over $100 in 1 day, take your receipts to the tax refund counter with your passport and get receipts stamped so you can claim tourist tax refund at the airport. One stop shopping!"
,,Must visit 24 hours mall,5.0,,"This mall now considered as Singapore one of must visit attraction. You can reach this mall easily from Farrer Park MRT. You cannot a name an item which you cannot find in Mustafa. Almost everything from household to electronic items you can find in Mustafa.. Please avoid Mustafa on weekends from 4pm to 10pm as it may be very crowded. Ideal time for shopping is after 11pm weekends(Friday, Saturday or Sunday) and anytime on weekdays. There won't be much crowd you can roam around this 4 storey mall."
,,Why in this modern world you require people to leave their bags at outside,1.0,,"Last time I checked, Singapore is a modern city/country. So I was shocked when I was told we all need to leave our bags outside before we get in.

Seriously? To be honest, the whole place is not even worth visiting. There're somewhere much better for your time and money, for foods, souvenirs and services."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,A shop that sells everything. Mainly cheap but some stuff can be found cheaper elsewhere. The shop is a labyrinth of goods and people. You could easily get lost in this store. A fine experience.
,,Big department store which has everything,3.0,,This place was like 1 big department store which sold everything. The chocolate section was a big hit since it has a lot of variety of chocolate with affordable price.
,,Good shopping place to visit in Singapore,3.0,,"Enjoyed going to the shopping trip whilst in Singapore. This is worth visiting.

The centre sells almost anything one would require for your daily requirements. Choice is wide and prices are competitive.

One would need a good few hours to spend in the centre as it is large and in multiple buildings.

After shopping go to Little India nearby."
,,Stocks everything,4.0,,"This is a 5-6 building shopping centre which stocks everything for high end goods of any nature to local and fresh produce.
The annoying thing is that you have to checkout her bags in outside and if you enter through one building, you may Coe out of another!!
Aside from that, it's a great 24 hour mall that has absolutely everything."
,,Products are expensive,2.0,,"You get everything you need, but are very expensive when compared with other shops. Do not buy from Mustafa, you can visit for price verification."
,,Cheap shopping galore,2.0,,"This was my 3rd visit to this place. Frankly speaking this time I didn't enjoy it much. With advent of so many shopping complexes in India you can get better deals in India. As far as Singapore is concerned for perfumes and electronics china street is cheaper if you bargain hard.

please ensure you carry original copy of passport if you plan to shop there."
,,Mixed review,3.0,,"Let me start out by saying that my husband and I were really looking forward to going here. We left the kids behind to really dedicate and focus ourselves on Mustafa. Maybe we were tired out from a day of sightseeing, maybe we went too late. Butt his place was beyond overwhelming. At one point we were actually lost-in the store. It was crazy. We walked past stuff that we swore we'd already seen but in a different spot. We saw chocolates 3-4 times, in different places.
Don't get me wrong, it was amazing. I wish I had taken the time to buy a beautiful dress. But it was just too much. If they had a map or guide, I wish I'd seen it.
We couldn't find the food court, one person told us it was closed, another said it was in the basement. Maybe it was poor planning.
I guess it would go again, but maybe get up early and go at 5am."
,,All in one shopping centre,3.0,,"Mustafa is the place is you are looking for some shopping in Singapore, be it groceries, food, apparels, gold and jewellery, boots and shoes, pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, stationeries etc, you say it and they have it. But in my experience, I must say they do not have good stuff with respect to apparels. P.s: it is open 24x7."
,,Shoppers' Paradise,5.0,,"Ranging from electronic to food items, from perfumes to vegetables, from cosmetics to clothes, everything comes under one roof to enable a marvelous shopping experience. This shopping center is massive and is widely spread out, with a lot of entry and exit points.
Personally speaking, for a shopper like me, this place demands at least half a day. For the others too, there are so many products and hard to miss deals.
This place knows how to confuse shoppers with intense variety and spoil them with choices."
,,Mustard Centre,4.0,,"Whenever I go to Singapore, Mustafa Centre is always one of the places I must visit either day or night, it is amazing to see the amount of products that is piled into the shop, a real Aladdin's cave.

The lay out and ranges of goods in the three adjacent buildings is a bit confusing. The prices are reasonable and at least gives a good benchmark if you want to try your luck and adventure into barge in with retailers elsewhere.

Please be aware that say some items like watches have international warranties and similar (but cheaper) models found elsewhere in the centre only have local warranties - albeit this is clearly indicated.

Worth visiting or to spend a rainy afternoon."
,,Not Worthwhile and Not for Tourists,2.0,,"The Mustafa Center is not worthwhile and the shopping isn't for tourists. It's a large venue selling various goods (cheap electronics), hideous furniture, and a large grocery store at the bottom. Walked in here accidentally, but don't bother coming here. Even a stroll through this mall is a bore."
,,Vast store,4.0,,"So big and good price..plenty of stuff..from bakery supplies to high end gadget. I wasn't familiar with their store layout and had to ask the staff several times but I found their staff helpful.

Their price tend to be better than other store.

Downside: confusing store layout, they should provide store directory/map"
,,Not interesting bargains for tourists,2.0,,Heard a lot about this Shopping mall and especially that it is open 24/7. Unfortunately was disappointed since it is very specific and really not a place for tourists.
,,Mustafa Center 24hour Shopping Mall,5.0,,If you need a last minute shopping at late night & need to get medicine and more. We can bring you there. Hotline +6593364142
,,Interesting place with cheap goods,4.0,,Cheap and affordable good sold here. Open 24 hours through maybe do not go over the weekends as it can be overwhelning
,,Complete market,4.0,,Mustafa is a place full of Indian. At one point of time one thinks that he ia in southern part of India. Crowd is honest and supportive
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,Had read that Mustafa centre was a must see was a little disappointed didn't find it that great a lot of men hang around that centre which I couldn't understand why felt a bit uncomfortable being there but didn't really find any bargains very hard to get a taxi also
,,fun place,4.0,,"i love to walk around this place looking at stuffs and if there is some thing interest me then i might buy one or two items.i always go there at mid night.. its not that busy durring midnight.. i think this place is good for impulsive buy, if you really want to buy serious buy maybe better not to shop here because looking the way how the stack the goods, im not so sure about their handling management..but over all i will come back again.. its fun.."
,,Huge...,3.0,,"It's a huge mall. They claim to have everything. True, they have alot, spread overe several floors and buildings. I was a bit disappointed not to find gopro redfilter for diving - even though they got gopros and other acessoires for it..."
,,A maze,4.0,,"Mustafa is a maze. Most residents know the best time to come here. As a tourist this is also useful to know. Avoid weekends when whole families land up to shop for groceries. Early mornings and weekdays are best. It's never empty though. Make a list if you plan to shop. There are many floors and narrow aisles to navigate. The food section is the most interesting because of the variety on offer. Beats all local supermarkets. Know your prices. Most times products are cheaper. But be prepared to hunt. Staff are more helpful now than they were in the past. You can check out anywhere so a cashier in an another area/floor may be less busy though most are really quick. Taxis from there during a rush period could be a problem. Many Indian restaurants around and a mall nearby for other options, decent washroom etc."
,,One stop for everything you need,5.0,,"This used to be a small store long back in Singapore whereas it is a shopping complex now where you get everything from food, souvenirs, cosmetics, electronics, jewellery etc. The best part is that the stuff is cheap from rest of the Singapore and there is no compromise in quality."
,,One of the most popular superstore in Singapore,3.0,,"Very big superstore with wide range of products from souvenirs to electronics, Provides money exchange services, Visas services. Crowded with tourists (mostly Asian tourists) during weekends. Fixed price (no need to bargain)."
,,Can find EVERYTHING there. Always!,4.0,,"Yes, this place is open 24hours, 365 days. All the time anytime you can go shopping there. And they do pretty much have everything (well up to a certain level of quality, don't go there to buy luxury goods). For day to day stuff, great choice and massive variety of goods on offer."
,,"reasonable prices, huge variety, less crowds on weekdays",5.0,,"A fabulous place to shop for anything under the sun. if you want the place a little less crowded, go on early mornings or on weekdays since its open 24 hours. Quality of items is fairly good though be careful of suitcases. I have bought many items from here on my yearly trips to Singapore and have been fairly happy with everyuthing. Sportswear, shoes, sandals, fabric, curios, etc. Once only I bought a suitcase which broke on my very first trip as I was flying back to California.
Lots of cafes and restaurants outside. you will love the experience though it tends to get hectic on weekends."
,,You just think you will get,5.0,,Seems they store everything we need. Just go and enjoy your shopping. Must try if you are near Little India.
,,One stop shopping?,4.0,,"There are so many things you can find here. This place has more than 1 building, but for travellers many food and snacks can be found at building centre 1.
My friend and I found a 1.90 dollar Ovomaltine in here, most of them have 1 week expiry date but we were able to find ones with 8 months expiry date - the ones were hidden at the back shelves seperated from the other soon expired stocks.
Chocolate such as mars bars, snickers, tobleron, kit kat, etc."
,,I don't know way I go!!!,1.0,,"It's located in the Indian area , really this market not suitable for the tourists . The store contain four floor and mix between clothes, cosmetics, supermarket and a lot of this but with bad display, rushed and bad quality.

I'm not suggest to visit this market in weekend because after you finish it's very very difficult to find taxi there with bad and not respect people there to stand in the queue"
,,Ahopping,4.0,,This place is huge and has everything that u need though not really expensive! I like it as it makes the area very busy and it's even open 24 hours for 365 days of the year!
,,Good for homesick Indians!,3.0,,"This huge mall has everything under one roof,from accessories to gadgets to clothes.Old hindi songs playng on the jukebox,its home away from home for Indians.Located conviniently in Little India.MRT station nearby."
,,They have got everything...in spades!,4.0,,"This shopping complex stretches a complete 2 blocks! Much like Printemps in Paris. They have got everything - watches, foods, supplements, household stuff, you name it. And for each item, the range they stock is incredible. And if you are into buying gold, this is IT. This place may have more gold than Fox Knox. (OK, I'm exaggerating, but they do have tons of the stuff, really).
Price is good and they give you a receipt for GST rebates."
,,Not For a Good Buy.,3.0,,"There are so many items that you can purchase,but selling price is higher as i understood. Good place for comparing."
,,A must if visiting Singapore,4.0,,"One of the largest department stores we have been to, which seems to sell EVERYTHING! Prices look to be keen, and there is a really good indian restaurant on the roof"
,,"So many things, so little time..... and money",4.0,,"The title just about sums up this review. Hahaha. This shopping mall is open 24 hours everyday and there's so much to see from luggages, groceries, sports apparels and accessories, sandals, rubber shoes.. and i haven't walk through all levels yet."
,,One stop shop,3.0,,"Mustafa has grown HUGE compared to when I saw it first in 1979. You can get everything here, just a matter of squeezing through very crowded aisles. The sales staff need some training in customer service, but otherwise if you are in a rush and want as much as possible in one place, and if you know where to find it, this is the place to visit."
,,Variety,4.0,,"A wide range of products available.. things can b bought ... nothing extraordinary.. may b skipped..electronic items, watches, perfumes are available.."
,,Huge shopping mall,3.0,,"Visited Mustafa with family for shopping. Mall is huge and flooded with stuff. Prices are moderate and not cheap.

Good points: huge, moderate price, varieties, 24 hrs open

Bad points: not nit and messed up, service is average, always crowded

But you must visit when you are in singapore."
,,Good prices on just about anything for you or your home,4.0,,"From shampoo and soap to jewelry, watches, luggage and clothing, Mustafa Center has a great selection of all this and much more and usually at the best prices in Singapore. It's a must see IMO."
,,So much stuff,3.0,,"This place seems to have everything. A bit overwhelming there is so much stuff. The only thing missing is customer service. Tried to get a battery for my watch, if you go in you will see they are seriously into watches, but when finally got acknowledged was just told ""NO""."
,,Lots of things but you have to be careful to not get ripped off,1.0,,"I'm not sure if this place is actually cheap but at least they have almost everything... Although you will spend plenty of time looking for it. My main problem with it is the dodgy ""price tags"". Eg: I was looking for an adaptor from my Mac to hdmi, I found 2 products with 3 different prices. Product 1: mini display port basic Hdmi adaptor cable S$19.90 - product 2: mini display adaptor for hdmi and others S$39.90.... Product 1 again but with the price of product 2... I though, oh, a mistake, but then found a whole row or the basic cable with the expensive price tag.
This is the second time that this happens to me (first time with some vacuum packing bags)
I really hope is a ""mistake"" but keep an eye to not be victim of it"
,,Shopping stop for all your needs,4.0,,"During our visit to Singapore, we got to know about the 24 hours operation of Mustafa Centre from one of our taxi drivers and visited the same at midnight and man, have to say,it's a place alive, right through the night, unexpectedly saw many families with young kids and toddlers, needless to say about the staff, lots of them to assist and arranging stuffs all over the store; except some of the sections like jewelry, all were open... you can find almost anything for your day to day needs, all shelves topped up... we found all the items needed... though had to browse through the store, better if we would have a google map of the store, as the store is spread across two buildings connected by a bridge over a street... had to do lots of walking, through the alleys :) but was happy to find so many items from all over the world... a must visit when one is in Little India..."
,,FROM BRANDED STUFF TO JUNK & THRASH UNDER ONE ROOF,3.0,,"Visited Mustafa centre on our visit to Singapore. Apart from endless stock in every part of the shop, it requires patience and percevierance to see all the endless products on offer. Don't bother asking any of the staff because i don't think any of them are trained or taught to smile or be helpful.
Even before we entered the store some rude man wanted to seal our bag incase we were shoplifters which is fine as security is important. A polite request would have sufficed.
If you are looking for variety and bargains all under one roof then it is a worthwhile visit."
,,WALKING INSIDE THE COMPLEX CAN BE TIRESOME '''''''',3.0,,do we have horizontal mobile walkaways movement inside the Cmplx 4 old and young?for tireless walk and see everything
,,Best Place To Shop In Singapore,5.0,,"Mustafa Center is huge Departmental store almost size of small Mall. They are famous for best price, best selections and best varieties for most of the items. In other words it's one stop shop. We went to get some cough drops end up buying lot of stuff because of the great deals."
,,One Stop Shop,5.0,,Its so huge and has almost everything. u can find all the products u can think of at this store. there are so many csh counters that u wil never have to wait for making the payment
,,An Aladdin's Cave for Shopping,4.0,,"Huge variety of items in this equally massive 24 hour shopping centre. The centre has even extended to include the building across the road. This place has your everyday items like toiletries, over the counter medicines, nutritional supplements, cameras, phones clothing, sports equipment, toys, groceries and dry goods amonst other things. It is also very crowded so be prepared to wait to pay and share the space. You can also get jewellery here. It has an atmodpere of its own, plus the fact it is in Little India. A must stop for tourists."
,,An absolute must for shopping in Singapore,5.0,,"I was thrilled to bits to find this centre which is open 24 hours, with reasonable prices and massive qualities of everything from jewellery, pharmacy items, perfumes, electronics.
You name it - it's there.
I purchased a new Rado watch. It was less than half the price of other Rado stores in Singapore.
We also bought a Sony camera and a Pierre Cardin carry on suitcase. There were so many to choose from with very fair prices.
My favourite shopping centre in Singapore without a doubt."
,,For the Desi Touch,4.0,,"Want to reminiscence about Desiim....head here.
Floors upon floors of everything you would want from groceries to decoration items to suitcases to apparels....you name it and they have it.
A must visit especially as its open 24 hours...go later in the night for a peaceful experience.
avoid on Sundays as its super crowded."
,,A bit of a let down....,3.0,,"This place is very crowded, not just with people, but with goods! You would struggle to shop comfortably with a few bags in tow or a trolley. A lot of the ""stuff"" is outdated and all jumbled together. The bargains are not really that great, and not worth the effort of having to hunt around for what you are looking for. You can get better quality goods and better discounts in the shops in the Malls. Don't waste your time."
,,Good place to shop for gifts but a bit too crowded,3.0,,"This shopping center is huge and stocked in a way that everything is found there. The variety is amazing. I went there to look for gifts for my staff. I found many choices. almost everything under the sun. And they are in lower price too compared to the upscale malls' things. When planning to go there, make sure you have ample time and energy as it takes a lot of time to roam around and one can easily get tired as the place is not like a big flat area with linear aisles but rather with many turns and corners and floors to cover. So sometimes it is hard to navigate as it is a bit crowded. I just wish they have a food court that serves food other than Indian cuisine; there is one on the top floor but it only serve Indian food, and it is a bit challenging for foreigners with kids."
,,Holy grail of shopping,5.0,,"This is the no.1 attraction in Singapore for most south Asian. You cant leave Singapore without a visit to Mustafa center. Its a 24 hour shopping mall with everything you need, I mean everything. This is also most reasonably priced mall in Singapore.Be sure to know that you will always end up buying more than what you planned for..it will elude you to do that!!"
,,good place to find daily nessecary stuff,4.0,,"if you want to find your daily needs and medical goods , its the best place , they offer a variety of clothes, non descripted medication and nutrition in one place but several floors, and the face its open 24/7 is so important in case of emergency . its fun to see it."
,,Best Halal Indian Cusine,4.0,,if you are looking for Halal indian and Pakistani food then this place is best. all kind of spice you can find over there.
,,One Stop Shop,4.0,,"This is a place where you can find practically everything under one roof. It can be a labyrinth to negotiate so let me put down broadly a layout to help you plan your foray based on your requirements. The advantage of the place is that it is open 24 hours x 365 days a year. It has car parking but it gets extremely busy on weekends. Sometimes, it is a good idea to come in at 7 am to browse at leisure. The nearest MRT is Farrer Park station.The floor layout broadly in the main building is as follows:

They also have their own bakery that sells snacks such as puffs, croissants, cakes, pizza slices, samosas etc.

This leads to the new building with a ramp that has pickles, sweets, dry fruits, sauces, juice, milk, butter, fish, poultry, mutton, beef, a whole choice of vegetables, fruits, spices, cold drinks etc. If you need cleaning fluids, disinfectants, air fresheners,sprays, wet tissue, toilet rolls, laundry detergents, diapers,brooms, mops, clothesline, pet foods,proceed to the end and take the escalator or lift one level up.

Approach the older sales staff who can direct you with the exact aisle and row of your requirement."
,,Don't go,1.0,,"Went there with my family, kids 11 and 13. The staff ignored us if we asked a question at a counter, or walked away when we approached. When spoken to they were just rude.
If we asked about an item, we were told it was not in stock, no matter what it was.
We left pretty quick as they were bordering on hostile, and we felt most unwelcome
We were pretty much the only non Indian people in the place."
,,Store of wide range of products!,4.0,,"Located very near to transportation, it means you do not need to drive or walk to far to reach.

This multi-storey department store has a wide array of goods to cater to all sorts of tastes. Sporting goods to foods, watches to stationery. You will be spoilt for choice.
Take your time to browse through as you never know what can be found.
Every trip has been fruitful for me.

After your shopping, there are numerous eateries in the vicinity to stave off the hunger pangs!

Got to come!"
,,Exhausting,5.0,,"This place is very big. Our hostel is conveniently near this shopping centre so we went here twice. It is complete and I'm sure anything you need, they'll have it. Because it is huge, we almost got lost but you can ask the staff the directions of course. They were very nice to us, maybe because we have a toddler."
,,"was great, good now !",3.0,,"kind of pilgrimage for all dime conscious tourists and certainly must go to place for locals...

huge place virtually every thing under the roof, the locals flood the grocery section...
Plannograming needs and upgrade but I guess shoppers like the chaos and hustle...some sections over crowded and over stocked...some emply throughout...

luxury segment available but one kinda doubts over its cohabitation with mass brands..

over all and experience worth having if visiting that side of the town..."
,,Crowded,3.0,,Just a big shopping center with budget / low prices. Did not want to buy anything so got in and got out quickly. But looking at the size of it and its popularity i expect it to be a big thing amongst Singaporeans.
,,Horrible hygiene!!!!,1.0,,So horrible and disgusting toilets! I was literally gagging nearly vomiting. The worst hygiene I have experienced. Went to find toilet paper not one toilet has paper! Shocked and people have a staring problem and making me feel uncomfortable. Do not recommend.
,,Shopping Crazy !,4.0,,Its got everything to shop for that you can imagine. Atleast a visit is a must. The qualitative aspect is to each his own but the quantitate aspect of the things available here is quite good.
,,"Huge, One stop-shop, Crowded",4.0,,"Mustafa centre located near Ferrer Park mrt at Syed Alwi Rd is a huge shopping complex. It has multiple entrance and exits. You need to know what you want to buy and then where it is placed in Mustafa else, you could be roaming randomly spending a lot of time finding products.

The complex/ mall sells everything that you could think of. It has huge Jewellery section, branded and non-branded. Golden, silver, diamond etc. There is also a section which sell ornaments with zero making charges, must visit.

There are electronic sections, sports equipment, gifting, clothes, watches, medicines, footwear, bags, cosmetics, perfumes etc. Then there is a floor on one side it has all the grocery items on the other side it has vegetables, fruits, etc. This is our particularly must-go, everytime-go kind of section. Everything is imported so quality is good. One section has all sorts of toys. There is also baby care, household stuff, utensils section. I am sure I am missing many more sections to list down. It is really a one stop-shop. The range of products it offers and within that the variety of brands, is commendable.

Though we do not prefer buying clothes from here, our shopping cart is generally full with grocery, Indian spices, fruits and fresh green veggies. We try to go at odd hours to avoid crowd. On weekends it is heavily crowded. It is open 24hrs. Some of aisles are very narrow and carrying trolley along with baby-pram could be challenging. It is definitely and exhaustive task to shop from Mustafa. Finding taxi is a bit challenging task after shopping as the demand is high!

It also has travel desk and money exchange counters. We normally exchange currency from Mustafa and find rates always better than elsewhere. They process visa for some of the countries.

There are plenty of eating options too. On the roof top is Kebab’s n curry and on and around Syed Alwi road are many more restaurants.

For tourists, a must go place just to see how a single shop could be and the variety it offers. Though I would not suggest to go there just to buy chocolates/ perfumes, etc. You can buy that from elsewhere also, go for the experience!"
,,Enormous shopping centre in Little India,4.0,,"This department store looks like the size of several pitches and is over many floors"". It sells practically everything from toothpaste and food to personal computers and microwaves. The amount of stock on the shelves is enormous. Each shelf is full of tacky hand written sale signs that disappeared from UK shops in the 1960's.

There's a very good Indian restaurant on the top floor were we enjoyed authentic Indian curries with delicious mango lassi.

Even if you don't buy anything it's worth looking around the store at the sheer scale of it."
,,They have it all in 1 roof,5.0,,4 floors. About 300 yards long each floor. Dept store to grocery. Mostly china made items. Branded name items. Crazy on weekends all cashier full. Weekdays not so busy. Some items are a bargin. While some you can find normal prices. I ended going here 3 days ina row and kept buying things. Gst refund for tourist. 100sg minmum can combine 3 reciepts to 100. For 90-10-10 you can do. But cant do 10-10-50-30. Max 3 to add up to 100. You get back 5sg in airport.
,,Items not available elsewhere,3.0,,"The range of items is mind boggling. If you have the time & bother, compare prices before buying. Not everything is cheaper here.

All the bad review about non-service is true, but when you do ask, you get the help. This isn't such a bad thing as opposed to sales staff following you around.

And it's true about long queues at the cashier point and very crowded. So go only if you have time to kill, without bored, fidgety children in tow, as you will most likely spend a long time there, unless you know exactly what you want and zoom in.

You need to look out for yourself when selecting the items, some are very old stock. When buying food items, be sure to check the expiry date (should do this whenever you purchase food items).

The draw, for me, is the range of Indian stuffs that you cannot find elsewhere: cosmetics, toiletries, incense sticks, medicinal products, vegetables, spices and especially foodstuffs. In fact, I go to Mustaffa just for this purpose only and am very pleased that I have this option.

I live in Singapore and I go there regularly to replenish the items I require."
,,Huge shopping centre that sells everything and more!!,4.0,,"This shopping centre is
ENORMOUS! It caters for literally anything you could possibly want. Prices are mixed, some cheap and some more expensive than standard. Don't go on a weekend during the day if you can avoid it as it is massively busy! But it open 24hrs so a trip there could be planned for the evening too. It also has a food court which I haven't tried, but seems reasonably priced. Well worth a visit if only to be amazed by the size of it, but be careful not to get lost."
,,UNIQUE,5.0,,Must go - 4 floors + 1 basement full of anything you could possibly imagine and offers also variety of prices
,,Unnecessarily Hyped !! Not worth at all.,2.0,,"We too like many had heard about Mustafa centre being one of the great places to shop so we too went there on day 3 of our 5 day trip of Singapore. It's a huge market and you get anything and everything under the same roof and it's 24 hours open!!
We bought a certain things from Mustafa market like selfie stick, multi pin sockets, clothes and shoes. I specially bought a chappal for 17$ from Mustafa as the one I had got was biting me and was uncomfortable. So I started wearing the newly bought chappal and to my shock it ditched me in just 2 days the sole got separated!! It was so embarrassing for me as this happened in the afternoon at our Gardens by the bay tour and we were to reach our hotel not until night 10pm so I had to actually walk barefoot till then !
We even realised that majority of the stuff you see in Mustafa is cheap quality but still overpriced and you can find all of those stuff at other street markets at much cheaper costs!
I won't recommend this place! Waste of time/money and energy."
,,worth a visit !!,4.0,,"When in Singapore,you just can't skip visit to Mustafa...Every single thing u need or u think u might need is available there..But But But , prices of watches were highly escalated and so it will be safe to infer that all electronic products would be rather expensive here..

while locals buy the routine house hold stuff, tourists may go n shop for basic things, food,chocolates,small gifts ,souvenirs ...We had lunch at roof top Kebab factory but food was pretty average so can easily skip that..

# Do visit two ""any 3 for 10 SG $ "" shops write opposite to Entry 1 of Mustafa.."
,,Great bargains,5.0,,At mustafa centre. I like all the item sold especially the perfume. The price is reasonable and the quality is good. Lots of imported item could be purchased here. Totally worth the time spent. Definitely will be back.
,,Singapore trip is incomplete without visiting Mustafa,5.0,,You want branded things at a reasonable or cheap price. No problem head to mustafa. This place offers almost everything and that too authentic and branded at a very cheap price. I would especially recommend picking up perfumes from here as many as you can
,,Shopping visit,4.0,,It is a very big general store with everything of daily requirement available .Located in little India is reasonably priced.Lot of Indian restaurants located around.Nothing special to miss if you don't visit.
,,Mustafa in Singapore,4.0,,"Very famous mall. You get everything under one roof. Best brands in the world are available . Right from electronic gadgets to consumer items, perfumes,jewellery watches so many items at competitive prices."
,,"If it ain't here, it ain't anywhere...in Singapore",3.0,,"Mustafa centre is a huge shopping centre, wherein one can find everything one can think of. The rates are competitive, with good amount of stocks of each item. Open 24x7.

Mustafa centre is jam-packed due to the arrangement of different products, causing a ""human traffic jam"" every now and then.To avoid this, try shopping during late-night hours."
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,You can get everything here. Its 24 hr running. Avoid sunday evening because of crowd. Walking place is small here. Hard to get taxi. Nice place for shopping.
,,Everything you want! Open 24 hours! Must visit! Requires patience.,3.0,,"Mustafa Shopping Centre is a huge One Stop Shop! Open 24 hours! Good prices!

There are many floors full of anything you could possibly want; from gold jewellery, clothes, shoes, electronics, gadgets, money exchange, food/ drink and a very accommodating (A/C) restaurant on the 7th Floor! We also noticed they stocked Australian specialist products like; Paul's Goat Milk (1 litre - $12 SGD).

If you have the time and patients, you will definitely be able to find everything you want! But I definitely recommend that if you wish you buy things from Mustafa’s, MAKE A SHOPPING LIST FIRST, otherwise you will get confused and lost with the endless amounts of products displayed.

There is no clear sign boards to view all the locations of all departments - so be prepared to ask the Staff what you want, and where to find it (multiple times)

Generally speaking, staff are helpful, but I imagine due to the amount of foot traffic the store receives, staff do not elaborate when giving instructions.
For example;
Me: Where is the restaurant?
Staff: Take lift to 2nd floor and go straight.
Me: (Once on 2nd floor and gone straight) Where is the restaurant?
Staff: Walk till end of vegetable section.
Me: (Once at end of vegetable section) Where is the restaurant?
Staff: Take lift to 7th floor.
Me: Reached 7th floor - where the restaurant was! (after about 10 minutes of walking) :)"
,,Buy everything you can possibly imagine,5.0,,"This place is gigantic, probably only place in whole of Singapore to remain open for 24 hrs & still be crowded at almost any point of time.Don't waste time in looking at the products on display, just go out there with a list & buy them - as much as you can.Prices are very competitive, you also get a GST claim form on shopping over 100 SG$....Shop till you drop."
,,India Town attraction,4.0,,"When you walk around this area, you will feel that you are in India only. Mustafa offers everything from pin to plane. Thousands of products to choose from at a good price. Lot of Indian food options in the surrounding area."
,,Great Shopping!,4.0,,"This is the place every tourist want to come and shop! Amazing experience, can get almost everything we want. I bought some perfumes and good discounted prices!"
,,Amazing shopping !!,4.0,,"It was quite an experience shopping at the Mustafa Centre. I believe you could find almost anything there and I certainly found my electronic spare parts (batteries, cables, etc) that I was looking for. All other sorts of products available: food, clothing, pharmaceuticals, etc.,etc. More an Aladdin Cave than a Centre !!"
,,the one and only,5.0,,"The one and only , legendary Mustafa Centre - a place in Singapore where you can buy more or less anything - food, clothes, shoes, toiletries, electronics, toys, perfumes, confectionary, sports goods, medicines, shoes and literally anything else you care to mention. it is very good for perfumes (extremely cheap - 2 x Davidoff cool water 100ml for 55 SGD and I can assure you it is genuine) and confectionary and toiletries (example : Neutrogena rainbath shower gel is 2 for 15 SGD and it's usually one for almost that price elsewhere). also good for changing money but it is worth having a browse around - the toiletries section across the road from main building is excellent and has really amazing beauty products at rock bottom pricing . be warned though the centre can get very busy on in evenings and weekends"
,,Great place for shopping,4.0,,The Mustafa centre is open for 24 hours and is a great place for shopping in the Little India area of Singapore. There are many money exchange available there and so it becomes a great place for converting your currency.
,,Serenity Now,5.0,,"The place is a madhouse. You need to go in repeating ""Serenity now"" over and over. It's because it's almost always overcrowded and there is so much stuff that you just don't know how to find things and make decisions. I give it 5 stars because it's the best place to find everything you need and at a decent price. I can't say that prices are better. But they are better for some items and worth the visit. I don't think this is anything special for a tourist. It's like a Kmart that is huge and ethnic. But this place has been great for me to buy nuts, American chili spice, basil, oregano, black beans, tahini, and other items at a better price than grocery stores. So if you're local, check it out.

As you arrive at Mustafa, there are many rows of tables and chairs for those who want to eat their own food, and also a luggage area. Both of these facilities are well thought of and adds to the comfort of shopping here.
The ground floor houses personal toiletries, perfumes and also cosmetics.

For those who are keen on modern and Indian ethnic wear- head for the basement. First floor is a snacks area and also retails many imported Indian food stuff. There is also loads of baby and kid stuff here. Essentially, Mustafa is a melting pot of everything you would want from Asia and Europe.

The special highlights are their imported Indian goods, i.e. Indian cuisine sauces, etc and also its "" gold souk alley"", at the basement.

There's a nice level of energy here, and you can see many shoppers carting away trolley full of goods. One of its jewel in the crown is the Indian restaurant at the rooftop. They serve a delectable range of authentic southern Indian cuisine.

Be ready to walk and comb each floor.

Wear flats and bring along a large shopping bag.

Many locals, Indian expatriates and tourists are seen as well."

I know people may things is the sasta shopping for not so good quality stuff but I disagree. It has the best prices for everything including perfumes. I thought I would shop few perfumes at duty free since they are supposed to be cheap but I regretted it. Mustafa Center is connected to Serangoon Plaza.

The sheer variety of anything one wishes to buy, and the cost effectiveness of items available under one roof is mind boggling! Electronics to computers and accessories, to TVs to Cameras, they have it all, as well as a good selection of kids toys and luggage accessories etc.

But down side is it is always massively crowded (Shop open 24/7, 365 days a year), too much is stuffed in too less space, no body to guide or show generally, signages inside confusing, long waits for billing."
,,Appaling Service,1.0,,"I visited Mustafa Centre at about 8am on a Wednesday morning. I had been told it was 24 hours. I was in need of new sandals as the ones I was wearing were hurting me. I was also with my 9 year old son who wanted to buy toys. I picked up a pair of sandals and my son picked up several boxes of toys. Trying to find a cashier willing to take our money was a nightmare. From the lower basement level I was sent from pillar to post, then to the next level, not a cashier open. Every member of staff sent me on my way. Got to level 1 (ground level) and again walked the full length till we came to the main entrance where there was an Indian woman serving a group of Indian tourists. She told me she would be shutting up afterwards and told me to find another cashier. I asked ""where?"" I have done the full length of 3 floors already and mobody wanted my money. She did not respond so I stayed where I was. When she finished serving the others she tried to send me away saying she was closed. Well by this time I was in pain and fed up. SO I got a little vocal. In the end she did serve me. Now I do not think I am usually a problem. I was trying hard to pay a $200 bill and nobody wanted to take my money. Considering they claim to eb open 24/7 I would suggest they need to have some staff working those hours too. I could not even be bothered to go back to claim the GST as they were so inefficient."

,,Selected cheaper options,4.0,,"A lot of people recommended me to visit this shopping center for its cheap prices when I was in Singapore. The stores are pretty overwhelming. You can get some electronic stuffs and chocolate on the 1st floor; foods, groceries, more chocolate, souvenirs, shoes, etc on the 2nd; bags, clothes, tees, etc on the 3rd. If I'm not mistaken they also have basement floor for children's toys. Some of the stuffs like perfume, bags, shoes, chocolate are cheaper than other stores. Their money changer also have a better rate than those are nearby hotels. However, I also found some others who are even more expensive in Mustafa. For instance, I could get 3 key chains for S$5 in Chinatown, and Mustafa sold the same key chain for each S$3. I suggest you also explore Chinatown and Bugis street for cheaper souvenirs. But if you have limited time, Mustafa is a perfect one stop shopping center."
,,"open 24 hrs daily, 365 days of the year",4.0,,"Best part about this place is that its open 24 hrs daily, 365 days of the year. Go here for all indian groceries and a multitude of other stuff which is available in every dept store. don't expect any service as its huge and staff when available around is not that interested in what you are looking for and most of the times unaware of where to find it , unless you happen to ask the person directly involved in that dept"

,,It's an antropological experience but not a place for turism,2.0,,A caotic array of rooms filed with almost everything you can imagine to buy with absolutely no service or knowledge of product. Cheap but rather go somewhere else.
,,Get cheap things here!,4.0,,"Heard of Mustafa Center in Singapore? It’s a 24 hours shopping center located on Syed Alwi Road in Little India. I call it “Toko Serba Ada” in Bahasa Indonesia, means everything you want to find is there! Ya not exactly everything lah but I can say that everything that’s inside a supermarket is also here! Plus, they also sell books, DVDs, watches, electronic goods, footwear, clothing, and also jewelry and household appliances. Around the area you can also easily find money changers and some places to eat.

It has 6 floors and two buildings. You can find a lot of entry and exit doors. You might need few hours to explore this place if you are really a shopaholic. Not to mention that things here are cheap! (I mean it’s cheap for Singaporeans :p) but I found that some things are also cheaper than Indonesia! I bought Pepero before which cost S$1 only when in Indonesia I need to pay for Rp.15.000 (S$1.5) haha.. So yeah, this is one of the place that you need to go when you come to Singapore. I suggest you to come early in the morning or maybe around late night cos’ maybe it won’t be so crowded. Maybe.

So, there are some points on why I like this place:

Perfect place to buy whatever things you want, especially your daily needs.
Open 24 hours.
Things are cheap.
Why I don’t like this place:

Sometimes it’s too crowded that you don’t even have enough space to walk.
I don’t suggest you to buy mobile phones here. Maybe they sell for low price but we cannot guarantee. I have read some bad reviews about buying mobile phones here so I don’t recommend.
How to get here : Stop at Farrer Park MRT station (North East Line) and follow the signboard to reach Mustafa Center. It’s so easy to find."

,,Just a huge shopping mall!,3.0,,"Its just a huge shopping mall kind of super market, useful for one who is living in Singapore.
But I don't think its a great visit for travellers.
I personally dint like the place much, definitely there are lot if things in one place but its more of bazar kind of shopping mall."
,,"Very big shopping mall.. but products display poor, price average.",4.0,,"You can find a lot of stuffs there, but products are very close to each other. Nothing cheap there, some items may be expensive but most of them are of average price."
,,A to Z of shopping,4.0,,"It's only an understatement that everything is available at this Singapore outlet. Yes maybe, you can't shop aeroplanes here, but then who wants to shop aeroplanes.
Mustafa center is a behemoth of shopping centre which hoardes, stacks, sells, delivers everything what you want to buy. It's fairly priced, and trust me, quite elaborate when you walk into the mall. There are also money changers available near the entry, who can give you a good exchange rate. If you are looking to buy a flat TV and take it along to your country, they even ship the TV to Changi Airport as per your convenient flight timings, for a nominal charge, so that you are saved the hassles of transporting it to the airport yourself. Staff is at best, mediocre, you can pretty much navigate and find info yourself. Great for daily needs as well, if you are staying in Singapore long enough."
,,Well worth a visit and open 24 hours daily,3.0,,"We were in the neighbourhood and dropped in for an hour. They have almost everything you could possibly need, from cosmetics to toiletries and perfumes, from shaving kits to electrical appiances, from t shirts to shoes, and from cooking sauces to suitcases.

And their prices are generally cheaper than elsewhere. For instance, I bought a Brut deodorant from Far East in Scotts a couple of days ago for S$3.80 and they were selling the similar item here for a dollar less.

The place is across two major buildings and several floors and can get very crowded, especially on weekends. The nearest metro stop is Farrer Park, and it is also well served by taxis and bus services along Jalan Besar and Serangoon roads. If you have a haversack, make sure to visit the security booths at each entrance so they can seal your bag with computer ties (a shoplifting preventive measure).

Do also check out the Indian restaurants nearby, especially the vegetarian options."
,,"Plenty of choice, packed out with people, hard to navigate",4.0,,"If you like shopping this place is for you. Its got good prices and a variety of things within it, I mean there's a whole shopping centre on the second floor.

The downside to this place is its not exactly located centrally so can be a bit of a pain to get to unless you taxi it. Its crammed with people, both tourists and locals, and whilst has novelty holiday items, it also has day to day things at good prices, so could be worth stocking up if your running low on supplies.

It doesnt in my view offer great tech options, although there were tech stalls within it. The frantic nature of the store in terms of stalls being next to one another and loads of people made it hard to navigate in my mind. Also its open 24 hours so id imagine its quieter during the day, I went about 10pm when the streets were buzzing. The stores outside here are also worth a visit to compare before you head in and try your lucky in the store itself."
,,Great Shopping store with all kind of stuffs,5.0,,"A lot of stuffs here with good price. It is not too expensive and I can find so many stuffs such as cloths, shoes, cream, house stuffs, chlidren, men or women. I took a lot time to walk and see everything in each floors."

Went back to hotel a happy customer"
,,For shopping fanatics,4.0,,"This is an excellent shopping place for both tourists and residents. The products are cheap and good. If you are travelling back home, you can buy home something from here."
,,A big 'ol store with lots of cheap stuff (great if looking for food-items),3.0,,"This place is fun because it's open 24 hours - but, unless you're looking for something specific - it can be a little overwhelming. There's people everywhere and all kinds of merchandise all packed into tiny spaces.

Jewelry, DVDs, cheap souvenirs, and general grocery store items (haircare, foods, kitchen items)... we wanted to just check it out, and ended up buying some spices - which also make great gift items. There's all kinds of indian / malay / chinese seasonings and spices.

Prices are cheap, and cashier lines were surprisingly short and plentiful. Overall, this was fun for about half an hour. Afterwards, I was ready to get out."
,,The best 24 hour shopping centre,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is located in Little India. It provides from all snacks, perfumes medicines, personal cares until gadget accesories.

They sometimes also having a great deal for some item. This centre is always crowded, so be careful if you bring kids.

The bad things are they dont provide boxing service your gifts. So you need to get the box at the back of the store, which is make me a like a little beggar."
,,Biggest Departmental Stores,3.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a 24 hours open shopping mall situated on Syed Alwi Road Singapore.

Mustafa Centre is located at Little India, where many Indian Shops and restaurants are located. But there is no Parking place and vehicles have to be parked on the road side. Mustafa Centre can be approached by Local Transport system and by private Taxis. Taxi fares are very reasonable.

We were staying in Rangoon Road, during our visit to Singapore, which was very nearer to Little India and Mustafa Centre. We visited this shopping Mall on 1th February 2016. The Departmental stores is spread over in 6 Floors and has Lifts and Escalators from flooelbla watches etc are available here. It is said that there are about 300,000 items available in this stores.

All the items kept here are more or less available else where and particularly in India too. Its only crazy to make a shopping here. However, there is one Jewellery wing where a number of items are available (some of which, we may not find in India). These Jewellery items are attractive and we get back the GST collected by the stores, provided we register and submit the claim showing our Pass Port etc.

Other services provided by the Mustafa Centre are Foreign Exchange and travel arrangements. A restaurant is also available in the centre. Thousands of tourists visit this stores and make fancy purchases."

,,Good place for shopping freaks,4.0,,Mustafa Centre has all that you want to shop under one umbrella. You can finish your days visits and reach this place late evening to complete some shopping and there are some good places nearby for dinner as well.
,,Not impressed,3.0,,"Alighting Farrer Park MRT station, we took the exit for Rangoon Road, where we turned right until arriving at Serangoon Road, where we turned right again, until Syed Alwi, where we turned left. Mustafa Center was a sprawling agglomeration of shops at the corner of Serangoon and Syed Alwi, and along Syed Alwi. About a 5 minute stroll from Farrer Park MRT to Mustafa. Many shops, mostly cheaper consumer goods, heavy on electronic items, but pretty much anything you could ever think of buying. Not the cleanest or mall, and rather chaotic.

Much better than the duty free stores at airport"

,,Quite An Overwhelming Experience,3.0,,"I was visiting Singapore on business and when I asked some friends my ""must visits"", they recommended Mustafa Centre in Little India. I was very excited because my 14 year old son and I, love Indian crafts - from shawls, beads, gems, sweets, snacks and spices. I was so excited on experiencing Mustafa Centre that when my friends asked me where I wanted to go on the last day of my trip, I chose this place.

We went around 9pm on a Saturday and oh my goodness! The place was packed! We had to park all the way to the hotel closest to it. The street traffic was so horrible, people were yelling at each other! It was quite alarming.

I love the story behind this centre as my friend proudly shared with me. Truly, Mr. Mustafa's vision is commendable and I have all the respect for him and for the lives and businesses that have been transformed as a result of his vision.

They had buildings upon buildings of stuff! If you can imagine it, they probably have it! We went through floors and floors, browsing through their merchandise. My favorite place is the wool shawl place. Oh my goodness... I love shawls! This department will always be memorable for me because my dear friend Elizabeth, saw this beautiful pink shawl and asked me what I thought. I said, ""It's stunning and will definitely look great on her!"" She went to the cashier, paid for it and as soon as it was packaged, she turned around and said to me, ""This is for you... my gift to you!"" It was such a beautiful story I really just want to share, because this helped me not focus on the fact that some of the ladies working in the shawl, t-shirts, lungi and dhoti section weren't very helpful.

As for the price, I guess because many things in Singapore are rather pricey, people go to Mustafa Centre for their reasonably priced merchandise which compared to some of the places in the US, is still about the same price. I am a very attentive shopper and I can tell that US shoppers are not really getting a great deal if they go there to buy apparel, shoes, etc. Perhaps they have great deals in jewelry and gold as I saw quite a crowd there.

I think one needs to be intentional when going to Mustafa Centre. It's great to experience at least once if you're already in Singapore but perhaps try to time it when it's not so busy. I heard it's open 24 hours, 7 days a week which in itself is remarkable!

I like giving my reviews a 5 but for this one, I'll have to give it a 3 because if I didn't go with my friends, I would have probably been lost. I have traveled many countries and been to many mega malls and centers , including some in New Delhi, but never quite felt overwhelmed and lost. They could also improve on customer service and have their sales ladies smile a bit more and show more interest in helping their customers."
,,HUGE shop - has EVERTHING,4.0,,"Truly enormous shop, packed to the brim everywhere. Prices are reasonable. It really does seem to have everything, food, clothes, electronics, tools, crockery, stationery . . .

. . . and it's very easy to get distracted and / or lost so make sure you have a plan for meeting up if you get separated.

Do try out the Indian food at the rooftop restaurant. It's very good and also a reasonable price."
,,Singaporean Walmart!,5.0,,"A cultural icon in Singapore and a compulsory destination. You get everything include gold, silver, chocolate spices,groceries, music,clothes, shoes, pharmaceuticals, personal care, sporting gear, musical instruments, electronics, white goods..... You name it!

If you like the crowds, this is for you!...if not then get here at 7am!

It's open 24/7."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The gold department of this amazing centre is huge. Like a supermarket of gold. They have everything packed in this Mustafa Centre. Worth a visit
,,3 am,3.0,,I would like to thank Miss Sri Devi of IC No F***2921 for her honesty to return my wallet to the security officer on the 19 Mar. Her honesty is to be commended. I feel great gratitude toward her. My wallet is Prada Black leather. Miss Sri Devi should recognise the description. I hope she gets to read this and finds out that the wallet is with me and it is greatly appreciated that she took the time to turn it in. To the Security Officer Mr Dhanapal Subranmanian of IC No S***7864J thank you for taking the trouble to hand the wallet at Rochor Police Station.
,,Chocolates and skin care items,3.0,,"Place is so huge and it takes at least half a day to cover all the floors. We bought chocolates and skin care items like soaps, moisturizers and perfumes for a very good price. Toys bit expensive. Floors are allocated separately for grocery, clothing, medicine, electronics, hardware, jewellery, toys and gifts.

And the most important thing, there are plenty of Indian restaurants outside from where you can fill you tummy for a very cheap price."
,,One Stop for almost everything,5.0,,"I have never failed to visit this establishment whenever I am in Singapore.
My recent visit was after five years and I was amazed to see the vast improvements created here. I do not think there is another facility like this anywhere else.
I did all my shopping in one visit which allowed me to do my sightseeing in peace.
This is a ""must visit"" place for all visiting Singapore."
,,"Untrained, rude, unfriendly staff",1.0,,"If you are looking for cheap stuffs you can go here, but be careful with the staff, they won't help to give a proper services and they also have rude manner towards the customers.

Dear Mustafa Centre owner, before open the store, better to train your staff first how to treat the customers well. These staff think they do not need the customers, they think the customers will always come there, but remember, things not always be the same... if these people know another same place with better services, or they feel too upset to your staff, they will never come back to your shop again..."
,,This place sells everything 😀,4.0,,"This shop sells everything and is a great experience even if you don't buy anything. Worth going to the supermarket area just to check it out. For lunch we went to the top floor to eat, they have amazing curries."
,,Great shopping center,5.0,,"Mustafa center is synonymous with little india.
24 hr shopping center where you can purchase literally anything..
From great rates on foreign exchange jewelleries electronic items clothes pharmacy food grocery etc..
Always crowded and more especially on weekends. When locals do the shopping..

When you are entering they seal the bag using cable ties..
Lots of Indian food options nearby.

Difficult to get taxi from there as lots of people will be waiting.."
,,Haven for Low to Middle Incomers,3.0,,It offers quite wide range of prices. From cheap to expensive. Then again it is too stuffy. I wonder if it was because the building cant accomodate the supplies. I guess you almost can find anything for daily needs. One thing I like the most is not about the Place itself but the multiethnics people that swarm the place. You can find any people from many different backgrounds and it sure near many places to eat foods from many different cultures.
,,24 hour Aladdins Cave,5.0,,"I went to Mustafa Centre in search for some saris to use for interior decorating.They had a magnificent collection of saris in a wide price range beautifully decorated and very beautiful.
I wanted to use them as curtains and couldnt find exactly what I wanted until one of the staff showed me material lengths of saris on a roll.Temptation was given into and I purchased 9 sari lengths, very bright and beautiful.They will be used to frame a moroccan outdoor area.
I also purchased several other items from this fantastic shop, there is so much to see...you tend to loose time in the shop.
If you love shopping this is a must visit store."
,,Jungle of shopping,4.0,,"You can get there either by taxi or MRT Farrer Park NE8, well this huge place two arcades connected to each other full of what you need or not.. its 24 hours open late night shopping is much convenient and less of rush.. if you are into herbs and mas-alas they have the best quality and in different packing, male branded shirts on very reasonable price range from S$10-30 abandon but your luck if you find your shirt .. shop of S$100 or more and you can claim the VIT .. spare two hours at least to see some of this mammoth store.. must visit."
,,Stuffed with stuff,4.0,,"This is a 6 level shopping mall (or maze) that is stuffed to the rafters with anything you can imagine. We found it a good place for shopping for gifts and some items that would be bit unusual for us. Having arrived pretty early in the morning, the place was not very busy but it quickly got busier in the 2 hours we spent there. I can imagine it being also stuffed with people later in the day. The prices were not what Canadians would consider great bargains, but it was a very interesting place to visit."
,,Incredible.,5.0,,Huge mall in Little India with everything. Open 24 hours. You will find anything you need there. The staff is helpful if you don't find what you are looking for.
,,Not sure what the fuss is about,2.0,,"We were recommended to shop here. I didn't find anything of outstanding value, most things were more expensive than back home in Australia. The shop is like an old emporium with a huge array of stuff. Check it out if you must, but I wouldn't go out of my way"
,,Good For Night Shopping,5.0,,"This is 24 hours shopping paradise in singapore..we can buy anything at this shopping center. Must try their vegi.samasa. Many good stuff, cloth, luggage and food can get from there."
,,Exciting 24/7 Shopping,5.0,,"In the heart of Singapore's Little India is this grand gem of an institution thst believes in shopping till ones drops at any given time of the day or the week or the month.

No matter what you are looking for,it is available at Mustafa Centre. And I am not exaggerating when I say you can buy anything and everything you are looking for.

My family and I mostly shop electronics, gifts, jewelry and sarees. I love this place mostly because of some of the name brand Indian Jewellry they sell. Just before my wedding, I bought a beautiful Tanishque set. I also live this place because of the beautiful sarees and cloths they sell. I make sarees out of these cloths all the time. They have a beautiful collection of French chiffones, Charmourse, crepes, laces and satins. And they have them in all hues, prints etc. A huge portion of my wedding shopping was done from this store.

And sometimes, when your flight comes in at a really odd hour and your hotel wont let you check in till 11 am and you are full if energy and have dropped off your luggage at the hotel and have a lot of time to kill, this is the most ideal place to shop and to kill time. If you are hungry, there are wonderful restaurants and eateries where one can get really authentic and yummy Indian food and snacks.

You must visit this store at least once. It is a fun and happening place and the best part about it is that it is open every day and 24/7! There is no other store like this in Singapore. So a must visit!"

,,Everything under one roof,3.0,,"Brought some friends there last night, its not really a shopping mall, more of a outlet, the things they sell change all the time, but its a very good place to buy gifts, clothes and food. Some food that are difficult to find elsewhere can be found here such as foreign brand candy specially chocolate, and soft drinks such as Dr Pepper, the frozen section also very good with a lot of variety. Same with dairy, the sell cheese in large packages.
One night here is a must for everyone visiting Singapore."

,,Lots of junk under one roof...Nothing great...but how he has become so big.....!!!!!,3.0,,"This is such a huge place selling all sort of things....every time I visit I drop in to this place...just to see what people buy here.....

How this guys has grown so big over these years.. I remember visiting this place way back in 1992...it was a decent place to shop and was in Indian Hub....but today this place has become 100 folds bigger than what it was way back.

I feel a lot of cheap stuff is available in this place, i would not shop here..."
,,Quite huge!,5.0,,"Good place to shop for locals. For travelers, not of much use, except some snack bars n perfumes. But defn cheap compared to other shopping malls in singapore"
,,Shopper's Paradise,5.0,,"Mustafa Centre is the best place in Singapore to buy gifts for self and for gifting family and friends back home. It has everything for a shopper from Electronics to perfumes, body lotion to home furniture to chocolates. Its a one stop place for any shopper with great deals."
,,Shop till u drop,4.0,,"Shopping Heaven having good bargains. We were their after 11 PM hence not much rush, but even at this time activity is to be seen to be believed. Cannot cover the entire shop in one trip. Got good bargains on perfumes miniature purchased for souvenirs. One advise the counter staff are not very friendly and need to be motivated. This is because they get tired Standing for 12 hour shift."
,,Dissappointing,1.0,,Don t waste your time and money at this centre its not cheap saw a really really cheap looking guess bag for 79 singapore dollars - the goods are very cheap looking
,,Bargains galore,4.0,,Not for the faint hearted - narrow aisles and crowded access points - but terrific for bargain hunters. No up-market boutique shopping here; just plenty of good stuff for daily needs.
,,Truly massive shopping centre with an insane variety of products from jewelry on down to basic foodstuffs!,4.0,,"Truly massive shopping centre with an insane variety of products from jewelry on down to basic foodstuffs!

I was floored by how many products you can find in this place ... we ended up getting almost all of the souvenirs for the entire trip in Singapore in this one place."
,,Interesting shop when you cannot sleep,4.0,,"This place is open 24hours and is a short walk from the MRT. It is in little India so do not expect an American style nicely presented throughout experience. It is jammed packed full of electronics, fabric,hair/beauty stuff, spices,food, kitchen bathroom department upstairs. My fav bit is the huge jewellery wing. Massive selection of items, different floors for gold etc, all done by weight for cost, not workmanship. So you only pay for gold. Take passport and they refund tax for travellers there and then. Lowest grade of gold is 18ct. If your after gold or jewels......try here. No bargaining set prices."
,,Everything there,4.0,,you can buy everything there... but not much cheaper...need much time and money to spend...good collection of each and evry item.. you have
,,Almost Everything under one roof,5.0,,"This is a must and standard shop to visit for anyone coming to Singapore. You get anything & everything from Electric plug to costly Gold, designer stuff and more so it's open 24 hours. Queue may be bigger during duty changeover times, be watchful"
,,Great Shopping experience,4.0,,"Go late at night when there are not so many people - then it is easy to navigate! I stayed quite nearby so it was easy to pop down for a shop. You can get some real bargains (depending on your currency), we found travel accessories and travel adapters were very cheap and useful. But are also items with fairly comparable prices to home."
,,if your short on time or in need of a mall 24hrs a day,2.0,,"As we weren't far away we visited this mall as i had read it was open 24hrs a day. Its a weird mixed up place. Don't get me wrong it literally has anything and everything you could think of, from designer watches to your favourite brand of shampoo. Pick up snacks and chocolate to souvenir trinkets. But not the place for me."
,,Shops till you drop??,4.0,,"Take MRT, stop at little India station
The center is huge and full of stuffs. Electronic, souvenirs, fake germ, watch, vitamins and many more.

Mustafa center known as a budget stores, but today I found its not much different from other places. Electronic some event more expensive than our country. Priceless Vitamins most are nearly validation. Check carefully because they have no return policy. As for household the price is considered cheaper.

Shop wisely"
,,For Budget shopping,4.0,,"Mustafa is the one shop stop for most of the residents. Tourists might find this mall curious and confusing. Curious because of the a-z availability here. Confusion because of its design. The building has 6 exits and entrances. There are two buildings on either side of the road connected at level 2. Being a regular grocery buyer I get lost most of the time. If you are visiting with family, make sure you all have phones. Otherwise always be together.

Gold section here is very good with a lot of options. Gold rate is the best and with good quality

Buy anything here without worrying about the price. It's best price guaranteed except for Haagen-Das ice cream which was a bit cheaper at FairPrice!"
,,24 hours shopping,4.0,,"It's 24 hour open, so in case you need something urgent to get, you can buy it here. It was late and I really need simcard for my phone, I got it here. Went well with me. But apart from that, I never shop here. They have everything there. They sells everything but we were too tired to explore. Maybe next time."
,,must do shopping here,5.0,,this place is awesome you can get any item in this place at an affordable rate compared to other places
,,Absolute Tack,1.0,,"Went here after reading the great reviews.What a disapointment,a load of cheap rubbish piled high,I can honestly say do not waste your time whilst in Singapore going there,there are far better affordable shopping malls."
,,A one stop shop for all your needs,3.0,,"The much typed Mustafa, it was another place on my list. Previously it was a place to pick up great deals on virtually everything. But now due to exchange fluctuations its not that competitive. Some sections like toys are lacking options."
,,Massive!,4.0,,This place is huge. It's almost like you can buy anything here. The prices could be tricky. Careful with the toilet...
,,Everything is here!,4.0,,"They sells everything, literally everything hehe. You can buy souvenirs and chocolates. Bugis Street is cheaper than Mustafa because they sell it in a package. But if you want to buy just one piece, you can buy in Mustafa. Mustafa sell some chocolates per piece."
,,24 hrs shopping centre,4.0,,"The one and only 24 hrs shopping centre in singapore. Located in little india, this shopping centre sells everything from groceries to luxury products. Good money changers there too. Give good rate"
,,You find it all in here,4.0,,"It's nice they have opened all the time. I had a lot to look at, unfortunately time was not on my side. As a European, it's kind of funny to see all the brands in such a place, which is rather... Simple. But that's ok, you get a lot to choose from."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Open 24 hours a day, it is an interesting place for shopping. You can find anything you want. The place is huge. Price are not that cheap but if you look correctly you'll find very good deal. Avoid to go on Sunday as it is terribly crowded, most of foreign workers are day off and meet in the street.
Don't forget to claim your GST refund on the ground floor 2"
,,Always a blast to go here,5.0,,"Giant shopping complex in Little India, fun to walk through and the prices for jewelry are the best in Singapore, also open on holidays (such as Chinese New Year) always crowded so bring plenty of patience"
,,Good place good price,4.0,,You can find many kind thing in this place. The price cheap and any kind of option. You also can shop for singapore souvenir in this place.
,,"Average Place , too hyped",3.0,,"I did not find the prices competetive as hyped in most websites and portals about this place. Was a mess and commotion inside. Although the good thing is you get a lot of stuff under the same roof if you are short of time and need to shop before leaving Singapore. I had shop for gifts for my nephews and was running out of time, I got a decent selection of toys to chose from.The sales team was not very helpful and was least interested to sell. The cashier was pretty helpful though to ensure a smooth transaction. I would say the Singapore airport has a better selection of brands and stores to shop ( Duty Free ) ."
,,Cool place!!,3.0,,Cool place to shop.. it also has few indian restaurants where you can have nice food.. you can try it if you have time..
,,Place to shop,4.0,,"(+) Have a wide varieties of stuffs on sale from electronics to snacks, books to clothes - on a cheap price if they're on sale, but average when they're not (some are overpriced, so be smart when you shop)
(+) Open 24 hours! although the latest I've been there was 11 pm and there's still a lot going on there.
(-) Old building and the sanitary wasn't good"
,,Good place for shopping,5.0,,"It is very supprice when entrance to the Mustafa shopping centre because there are a lot of thing to buy. You can find from the vegetable to the luxury good such as high standard perfume.
The price is very cheap if compare with the other shopping centres in Singapore."
,,Not a Fan,2.0,,I personally dnt like shopping in Mustafa as the price are not really low. I think this place is mostly for tourists who are not familiar with bargain places in SG. The shopping center is just too congested.
,,store that has everything,4.0,,"This 24x7 store has everything you need with reasonable price. Walked around the food's section is very crowded, especially at the chocolate's section. Came here in the afternoon and I can't feel the aircon. Farrer Park is nearest MRT station."
,,Wow! A 'must visit' store.,5.0,,"High volume, reasonable prices, reliable quality goods. This store has everything. It looks like it takes a no frills approach and offers value for money. You name it this store will have it. A good example of the value is, we were after some perfume for our daughter. Dolce and Gabbana, Light Blue. It was SGD $135 at Changi airport duty free. We got two bottles for SGD $140 on a special promotion. When not on promotion it was SGD $95 per 100ml bottle. Even the taxi driver commented on the quality of goods and the value. I walked into the Gold / jewelry section and was gobsmacked. 22 carat gold chains, lockets etc. Because of their reputation for being reliable (no fakes) and offering quality at reasonable prices, I purchased a gold chain and locket for my wife."
,,Still a must-go-to place for essentials,4.0,,"Although the ringgit has fallen against the Sing dollar i still make it a point to visit to pick up essentials and items not available in malaysia. A must-have is the 4711 cologne. Their tech accessories floor has a fantastic selection of items and also their household floor.
Still worth a visit."
,,Take breadcrumbs to find your way out,3.0,,"This is the second time I have been to the Mustafa Centre and the second time I have found it difficult to navigate around the place. My sense of direction isn't the best at the best of times but when it comes to shopping I am an expert. Took me 30 minutes to locate what I was looking for and again when I went to the new roof top restaurant the lifts that you had to use were not clearly marked. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place as it has everything you could imagine. The food sections are unbelievable with all cuisines catered for and at a reasonable price. Sometimes getting from one floor to the next is difficult as the lifts are relatively small and with trolleys and other shoppers it can be a bit of a squeeze. Personally I think everyone should visit at least once, just for the experience. Just remember which door you came in and hopefully you can find the same one to get out of.... Good luck"
,,Unkept place & not worthy at all !,2.0,,"Well I had heard a lot about the Mustafa centre in Little India but little did I know that it would turn out to be a horrible experience at this place . I went to this place on the last day of my Singapore trip and I'm glad I came out very soon .
Firstly, this place has totally unkept and unhygienic washrooms . The Singapore Health & Sanitation department had even notified outside on the walls of this place that ""Mustafa Centre has not been able to match up to the standards of hygiene ."" There were no toilet papers , handwash soap and paper napkins .
Secondly , the products kept there were damn expensive , coz the exact same stuff I had bought from the Bugis street market a day ago and on comparing the prices , the same commodity was hell expensive .
I would recommend tourists not to visits this place and spoil their mood.
Things could have been better only if they could hav maintained this place ."
,,"You hate it, but you will visit the place",5.0,,"This is where the close to a million indian community shop for their needs. The place is huge and they have tens of thousands goods in the never ending shelves. You want some spice which you can only find in one small corner of india - you can find it here. I dont think i can even share the list because you can literally find almost anything.

BUT here is the catch. You got to find yourself most of the times, and don't expect the store people will attempt to help you. The service almost doesnt exist except some rare kind souls trying. You'll find rude, careless, lost people walking across the aisles.

Sometimes the visitors fall in the same category and end up quite crowded and noise but recent days the store is trying to manage it.

On top of the regular super mart stuff, you can find Jewelry store, Travel Desk and Forex/Currenty converters.

Finally, this store is 24x7. So there is no way one can find such a huge store operating 24x7 and meet almost all the needs."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"This place gives you a fell of home away from home. It has all the Indian food items, plus this is quite famous among the local community as well. The foos on the roof top is quite good. The buffet is a must try here."
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,Multi story and a very big shopping center. It's remains open 24 hrs. And probably all the items/stuffs are available at this center.
,,great.,5.0,,wow.. great place for shopping. we can by everything we want in this place..it is on of a luxury shopping center i singapore...
,,Love this Mall!,5.0,,"I went to Little India with my family specifically on Mustafa Centre, When I first walked in I noticed Wow! what a big mall and so much to choose from, very nice items and for me it was affordable. the staffs are very nice, accommodating and speaks very good english, I was particularly looking for a red and gold bag I was looking all over those other places in singapore I did not find any which i only have found here! I was so happy to drop by this centre and I would want to go back."
,,Great Shopping mall for all Indians due to very competitive Price,5.0,,"This place is highly popular not only for Indians but also for people of other countries and locals due to its very large collections and very competitive price. During weekend one can not imagine the volume of crowd and it is so big that you may literally lost. The stock is so rich that one can find any favourite brands and the price is very reasonable. Electronics, Gold, cloths, perfume, TV, fridge micro oven and all household items are available under one roof. The staffs are very professionals and willing to help you in every possible way. For foreigners there is facility of GST refunds which is very attractive to get refund when you return back. For GST refund the minimum purchase in a day is 100 SDG and one has to submit the cash memo to GST counter at B2 level and they will prepare the refund voucher. do not forget to carry your passport and while you visited GST refund at the shopping mall. The another attraction of Mustafa Centre is the money changing shop and they will change all currency with a very attractive rate"
,,Not for Tourists - unless you need spices to stuff your luggage with,5.0,,"Costco eat your heart out. Oh my, if your in need of groceries in Singapore, there is only one place to shop. It took me about 20 minutes trying to find the grocery store, and even once you find it, your going to be doing a lot of walking weaving and bobbing. The spices and sauces were priced cheaper then you would find anywhere in the world. 32 Oz jugs of Crystal hot sauce. If only I lived here, I would have just visited heaven"
,,All your shopping needs under 1 roof,4.0,,"if you can look past the inefficient salespeople, they you are in for a treat. possibly a 1 stop destination for all your needs.."
,,Worse shopping centre ever,1.0,,"Was here to accompany a traveling friend looking for some gifts to bring home. We were looking for a particular perfume and struggling to find a hep from the staff. Even after several attempts, the uniformed staffs we were asked would not admit that they were the staffs and busy on their own things. I even got shouted because I spoke to her in English just because I looked like a local. It was extremely disappointing and unpleasant experience. I make sure that I don't want to come back and not even recommend it to my traveller friends. Cheap price is indeed does not come with a good service."
,,24/7 Wide Range of Brands!,5.0,,"I have always LOVED going to Mustafa Centre whenever I had the chance to do so!!

Located near Little India Mrt station, this mall is situated in the heartland which is usually crowded by the Indian Race along with the multiracial locals.

The 4 level Mall with basement access is totally filled with wide range of items! From daily basic to advance needs, travelling items, all age clothings, supermarts, medical equipments, supplements, cookware, curtains, bedsheets, tools, pet foods, make ups, sportswear, snacks, chocolate & bakery shop, Souvenirs, jewelries, watches, kitchen appliances etcs almost everything you can find it here! Prices range is affordable and the rooftop, they have a restaurant operates every night.. Along the Mall, there are multiple indian cuisines which are extremely delicious!

***TIPS TO TAKE NOTE***

- ENJOYY!!!! :)"
,,The Joyous Chaos of Mustafa's !,5.0,,"A leisurely stroll up the Serangoon Road from Little India station , ending up in the crowded chaos of the dear old Mustafa Centre is an absolutely essential part of every visit I make to Singapore . And , for old time's sake , that $9 lunchtime vegetarian thali in the unpretentious Delhi Restaurant ( on the left , half way along the way ) completes my feelings of total contentment . There are many fascinating little shops to investigate en route , but Mustafa's is my ultimate objective in Little India .

The elderly Mustafa Centre is extensive in area , spread over several floors in two adjoining interconnected buildings . It seems to have been there forever . It is crowded , constricted , cramped , confusing and crazily chaotic . I usually get lost within its maze.... but it truly appears to stock every item one can possibly imagine , plus many more one can't . I most often buy some bargain clothing (ask for directions to the main clothing floor upstairs), but I've also purchased perfumes , toys , or things electronic , all at ''good'' prices . Impulse buying is a real hazard also . If you plan to obtain VAT reimbursements when leaving Singapore , ensure you retain any necessary receipts . And , should you feel the urge , Mustafa's is open 24/7 apparently . A truly unique shopping experience !"
,,Interesting Food Section,3.0,,"The hidden gem in Mustafa is the food section.
Collection of Indian products from all over the world, chocolate brands from various countries, variety of spices, Middle Eastern and some Mediterranean products.
Messy, Avoid Weekends, Open 24 hours/365 days.
Some of the worst toilets in Singapore."
,,One stop shopping 24/7! Yeay!,3.0,,Everything under one roof. Massive place open 24 hours. Many Halal and Vegetarian food outlets around. Get some Es Kacang (shaved ice with syrup) to cool off after a hot afternoon of serious Mustafa shopping!
,,Crowded but worth it,4.0,,"I went there on Saturday night. It was crowded. Spend few hours to shop there. So many good stuff, food, luggage, and anything you need. And most of the stuff can be tax refund. Not suitable to bring baby stroller here. The place is quite narrow."
,,Everything under one roof,4.0,,"Its really a nice place and you will get what you want under almost one roof.
Only issue is it is always crowded. Considering it as plus point as normally good places are crowded.
I ve been to this place many times now and feel shopping is great.
My experience states if possible go to this centre after midnight as you will get more breathing space for ur selection. Even a currency exchange at entrance makes it very convenient for tourist.
Overall a great place."
,,Many Choices But Suffocating,3.0,,"This place is huge, and full of merchandises - food, clothings, souvenirs, electrical and electronics, medicine, books etc. Seems like it has almost everything. But it feels suffocating, probably due to how the items are arranged. Conveniently located near MRT station and opens 247."
,,Emporium of delights!,4.0,,"I visited Mustafa's about 5 years ago & it has kept its crazy, crowded charm. Merchandise is all rather crowded together - but there are some great bargains on good local brands, especially in men's clothing. The range of toiletries is also mind boggling & surprisingly cheap.
I particularly love the supermarket on 2nd floor which is massive. With its range of goodies from all over Asia it puts down the best American ones in the shade! I could happily spend a whole day there - especially if I had a spare suitcase to bring home tasty morsels.
Definitely worth a visit. I love the Glam Malls around town, but they do tend the look the same after you've seen two. This is a much more memorable experience."
,,Always amazing!,5.0,,"I had been a bit disappointed to read recent reviews. I had visited some years ago - about 10 - and so was not sure what to expect.
Contrary to other comments I found the staff helpful and the toilet clean! It is much more 'organised' than it used to be though still overwheming in its stock!
Well worth a visit for a specific purchase. I went for a carry on bag. Great choice and prices!"
,,Mustafa Fabric Store - Worst Customer Service Ever,1.0,,"The staffs are extremely rude, he yelled and chased us out of the display section since we take so long (probably 10mins?!!) to view the fabric. We could have called for manager if he not old enough to get our sympathy.
Although they do have good fabric, I am not courageous enough to back there again."
,,Everything under one roof.,4.0,,Amazing store. Level upon level jam packed full of every possible item to buy. Have visited here a couple of times but still manage to find areas I've never been to. Love coming here very late at night when all other shops are closed.
,,Singapore's Saravana Stores,4.0,,"A 24 Hrs Shopping Centre, has allllllllllllllllllll the things you neeed... 10 cents to 10000$... all u need is money and time... Its takes minimum of a day to go through all sections... GODFATHER of Shopping centres... You cannot sit anywhere inside thats the one i hated...!!"
,,On of its kind experience. Sickening actually,4.0,,"Crouded. Dirty toilets. Underpaid staff. Felt crammed. Children got sick n tired. No place to relax. Heaps and heaps of item with no end in sight. But still better than so call super stores we get in India. Prices are not really cheap. I'll be happy to pay bit more elsewhere where I can get good customer service, even though I am a bargain hunter."
,,Looooovvvee it,4.0,,"They have everything you need and the stuffs are cheaper compared to other shop on singapore. Location very strategic. Near to Angulia mosque and a Hindu temple, so we can do a very interesting walk."
,,Tiring Mall,3.0,,"This place is huge. Its a huge stretch. Everythin you need is available. Make sure to pick up what you need the moment you like it,it can get tiring to revisit floors. Not a mall to go with friends.Good indian food around the mall."
,,Every thing you need is here,4.0,,"Always making my time to go to here everytime I'm in SG. Just a place to fulfill your needs! From chocolates to perfume and clothes and souvenirs. And mainly products from India in reasonable prices.
Tip: buy bangles and earrings from India for your souvenirs! It is cheap. Love it."
,,Good fun even at 2am,4.0,,"So I visited here the morning as my jet lag and insomnia were kicking in. I have to say I think Mustafa centre at 2am is blissful.

Much more quiet than in the day and quiet a few people. I went in there with a shopping list and walked a way a happy woman.

People have mentioned about the customer service which I always have found good.

I love this shop it's like a well know internet shopping website all in one place!

Worth a visit at any time of day"
,,encyclopedia of shopping,4.0,,you can find anything and everything here in mustafa centre except customer service. but well who needs customer service when everything is under one room.
,,Terrible staff,2.0,,"I visited this store yesterday. While there is a huge variety of goods available, I have to say that the conduct of staff is absolutely appalling. I went to the gold jewellery section and selected a pair of gold earrings. I requested the gentleman behind the counter to assist me with finding a matching ring, and he flat out said there wasn't one. And..surprise surorise, when I looked myself I found one! It was the same with every section of the store...staff will see you struggling and needing help but will never offer it. And when you do ask for help, they act like they are being bothered, despite the fact that they are being paid to help! They are only good for running the cashier and that's it. I think the store owner needs to step up a bit and hire people who know what they are doing."
,,mustafa is the best,5.0,,"24 hours! i love this place, for shopholic like me this is the place to go, shop until you can, everything is just here, the perfume has the best price, chocolates and souvenirs are also available for your last minute shopping! lovable place in singapore"
,,Centre of Attraction in Little India,5.0,,"One can find anything and everything at this place. It doesn't matter if a person is on budget, because one could find a great range of products and price in this market. The most important thing is this supermarket is open 24 hours (and I mean it 24 hours!). Also one could find the many of the product prices cheaper than their home countries (I had a chat with couple of people there who were from Australia and Sri Lanka). I visited every day at night during my 7 day stay as my hotel was very close to this place. All in all I would definitely like to say that no one will be disappointed here. A must visit place."
,,Mustafa cafe - surprisingly good!,5.0,,"Sorry I'm going to review mustafa cafe here cos they don't have one for only mustafa cafe. I was there with my friend during week day for India visa, we wouldn't know what to eat and rushing off. We saw this mustafa cafe, and decided to give it a try!

Surprisingly it was good for a quick serving cafe! We ordered a chicken briyani dum, fish and chips, and onion rings. Briyani has prepared earlier and they will hear it up for you, it was still fresh and yummy with two big pieces of chicken, salad and curry.

Fish and chips are standard, onion rings are tasty, big portion and crispy. Other than the food, I ordered coffee..... They gave me Nescafé I think, and very diluted. So remember to avoid this when you eat there!"
,,"cheap price to buy lugage,bag,watch, parfume, ec.....",5.0,,I love to go to this place because this place open 24 hours and they sell everything you want with the competitive price
,,An incredible must visit place that won't disappoint.,5.0,,"We read all the reviews and decided it was a must do for us whilst in Singapore. It is very easy to find. We travelled on the MRT and then walked the rest of the way. It is chaotic and huge and so much fun. It is incredible to see $200 a pair shoes out of boxes and just piled on shelves one onto of the other and Parker pens costing over $150 each out of boxes stacked up in a glass cabinet. It is shopping like I have never experienced before. It is hard to comprehend how many items there must be in the shop. Every availabe space is used. There are some odd little things that make you laugh. We bought a suitcase ( excellent value - large plastic lightweight only $50) and this was on the first floor so we queued to pay for it on the first floor next to where the suitcases were on display. When we made it to the front of the queue we were told we could only pay for a suitcase on the ground floor. Quite amusing, You do see staff asleep .
I think if it's not stocked at the Mustafa centre you don't need it. Prices are reasonable but not all great bargains. The pens I looked at were only a few dollars cheaper and there is little by way of service to try the pens and it is unclear whether it would actually come in a box. The Manchester United shirts were $10 cheaper than Australia.Definitely worth a visit for the experience it is unique and fun."
,,Organised Chaos!,2.0,,You'll find anything and everything here! I found it to be a little claustrophobic. But if you can handle the mountains of items from watches to chocolate biscuits and baby shoes (i could go on) this place is worth a visit.
,,Super Supermarket,4.0,,"I was shocked when I was here. People said that this supermarket opens for 24 hours. WHAT???!!!! And it is true!

You can find almost everything in this super supermarket: electronics, foods, textiles, and etc. Incredibly, this supermarket is always crowded even the time is almost midnight."
,,Absolutely unbelievable range,5.0,,"This store is unbelievably large and is very easy to get lost in.

Sprawled across various buildings and many levels, this store has a humongous range of items on sale. Prices are reasonable and opening hours are convenient. Part of this store is open 24 hours also.

This is a one stop shop selling anything and everything from groceries and fresh food, to electronics, household appliances, and air travel."
,,This place is a replacement for Buckley's,5.0,,"As the old saying goes ""Buckley's or none""... Well Buckley's closed decades ago, and Mustafa Centre is the reincarnation. There is a floor of watches, a floor of gold, a floor of almost everything. It covers (at least) 2 buildings, with about 5 levels each. And it is all one store. You can shop the entire place and check out your entire shop anywhere. And the prices are great. Many brand name products (not knock off copies) and less than retail. And they are open 24 hours a day, so no need to schedule in a visit. Just go after dinner one evening. It is a short walk from Farrer Park MRT station. Just remember, trains stop running before midnight, so time your return well. Or a taxi to the city will cost around $9."
,,Shopping shopping .....and shopping,5.0,,"This place has got amazing stuff ..I guess they have anything and everything that you want to shop for.
You need to have ample time to cover this space. The center is open throughtout the day and is a 24 hr shopping center.
Certainly worth a visit."
,,"If it is not sold in Mustafa, it does not exist!",5.0,,This place is good to get lost. You literally find everything you might eventually have wanted at some point in your life.
,,Most visited place,5.0,,If u wanted to buy electronics this is d best place..also go thr govt.excise norms while buying as u have to pay duty first n then u have to collect @ airport so take bill..also this is d best place for money changer.u ll get lowest rates ever in entired Singapore..also if ur hotel is @ little India then Dnt take foreign exchange from india/singapore airport
,,Really good place,4.0,,Recently visited and purchased some gold rings.really they r different frm Indian gold. To surprise mywife I purchased gold ring . Really I suggest everyone to visit and enjoy little india market.
,,Good place to buy everything :),4.0,,Good day out with a short taxi ride from Orchard Rd - $8.00 Staff lazy and not very helpful. I bought some electronics and mostly elderly sales men with no idea. Got fairly good deal though.
,,shoppers haven,5.0,,"almost everything and anything under one roof. quiet cheap when compared to other places around the world and great selection too. from chocolates to cosmetics, groceries to clothing and endless electrical products too. bring out the plastic and swipe swipe swipe...they also process your GST refunds on site."
,,an real shopping paradise,5.0,,"best of the best in my review , but needs a lot of time to shop here as its a huge shop to choose from the displays done a lot of shopping from here , prices are quiet reasonable."
,,Everything under one roof,4.0,,"Great place to shop if looking for everything under one roof. Footwear collection is too good in terms of variety, quality and price. Huge range of everything right from cosmetics, electronics, jewellery etc. to choose from. If you are buying expensive electronic items, make sure you compare the rates else where as well. We got around 20 dollars lesser rate quote for a pair of binoculars from another shop. One should definitely make sure to visit here atleast once when coming to Singapore. It also has a money exchange counter which offers the best rates."
,,Not bad,3.0,,"The point of mustafa centre is that you can find everything you want there, just in one place. It is known that it is one of the cheapest places in Singapore, but I don't see it cheap, I just see it normal, just like the rest. Also, it is disorganised place, I don't the reason but it is very crowded and I don't feel I'm in a mall, actually it is not a mall. The only advantage I see there is that everything is at one place."
,,"I have loved shopping here, but they have stupid new rules..",4.0,,"I last shopped here in 2013 and bought a number of general and electrical goods. Coming back this year to buy more electrical goods, we were surprised that NOTHING could be taken out of the box so NOTHING can be tried before you buy. e,g, I bought a new camera and you cannot try it or see it's functionality until you have paid for it. I heard one lady going off about it near me and she walked away - good on her, if more of us did this they would be forced to change this stupid rule. They have a lot of cameras on show, yet you cannot try BEFORE you buy. I didn't walk away as I had already done some research and knew what I was looking for. The guy I bought the camera from on L1 was very helpful.
We also bought some Bluetooth headsets for the TV and again wouldn't let you take them out of the box to even feel the fit on your head. Actually the guy in B2 where we bought these and his lady assistant were very very rude.
So all in all we didn't enjoy our shopping experience at Mustafa this time around, rude service and stupid new rules - plenty of other places to go in Singers, only difference is this is 24x7 and they have a lot under one roof."
,,"As usual, whatever you can find!",5.0,,"As usual, this place will suit everyone as it has almost anything that you want or need. For example, fake CCTV, 5 in 1 fan cum light cum radio device and universal air con and TV controller. Little known to all, here have vinyl section too which is worth a visit.

Perhaps, this place is a nice place to buy men shoes. From safety boots to timberland!"
,,Not worth it,2.0,,This is a massive centre with everything under one roof. It is very busy but do not be fooled. You can get the same stuff elsewhere for less
,,3.28 am shopping,5.0,,"Shop 24 hours in this awesome shopping mall. From food, drinks, cosmetic, dvd, dc, jewellery, clothes, toys, books, stationery, pharmacy. U name it, they have it !"
,,Intimidating,2.0,,"It this is the only place in SG we felt this way... I went there one night with my mum and we could not wait to get out of there again.
The place is huge/maze like and it feels very unorganised, the sheer number of products are overwhelming so much so that they cant seem to stay on top of removing items that are way past their expiry dates.
You should also do your homework prior to going there, as they all claim to offer the cheapest prices for everything and this is not always the case."

,,Huge varieties in 1 place but expensive,2.0,,"You can find almost anything here but remember to check the expiry date as the staff here are quite lazy and do not remove expired items. Do remember to check the prices elsewhere before coming here as most prices are more expensive than outside. You will see many Indians buying trolley load of mostly foodstuff since you can find most indian cooking needs here. It can be classified as a One Stop Centre. Finding things may not be as easy task as the items are not properly arranged. Avoid coming here on weekends as the place will be extremely crowded and you have to walk Entrance 5 before you are allowed to enter. When its crowd exceeds 400 pax, Entrance 1 to 4 is only meant for customers exiting. Please do shop smartly as some products are of poor quality. Staff are not helpful. You can see them chatting or using their handphones. Avoid the wet market area as its smelly there and the fishes are clearly not fresh."
,,"Everything in one roof, specializes in Indian items",5.0,,"In this store, everything is available under one roof. Very large store. We had problem finding a taxi after shopping due to very slow moving traffic across the road. Best way to access this store is through Farrer Park MRT station."
,,Everything in one store,5.0,,"Mustafa Centre is open 24 hours a day, except for the jewelery section. Great value on branded perfumes, colognes and body care. Their chocolate and food section is a great find with many choices of Swiss, Italian, Belgian, etc. There's a chemist section if you need to buy medicines. Early morning shopping is best to avoid the crowd inside the store during daytime and evenings."
,,Many levels of shopping,4.0,,"Great variety of shopping from electronics, clothes, footwear & more. Several levels that join up under ground very easy to get yourself lost. Prices are reasonable for Singapore."
,,Lost glory... Avoid,3.0,,"Gone are the days when Mustafa was ""the"" shopping mall... i visited after 6 years and this mall is over !!! selling a gamut of unattractive, unbranded and cheap looking products which are not priced cheap. Please avoid and there are plenty of options available in Singapore."
,,Great Place to Get Anything at Reasonable Prices,4.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore and would like to purchase things to bring back home, this is the place to pay a visit.

Located at the edge of Little India, it is a sprawling complex, where everything is available - electronics goods, toys, chocolates, clothes, groceries, cookies, household items, gifts and so on. Everything is reasonably priced, and you can also get fantastic deals, if you are lucky! The staff is eager to show you stuff. It is also open for long hours.

They even have currency exchange counters.

The only negative aspect is that it is usually crowded and packed with goods, with very little room to move around. The place is haphazard and grimy at places.The check-out counters are also crowded often.

The fact the locals also shop here, means the items shopping here is likely to be cost-effective.

Do not visit this place if you want a 'luxury' experience. Be ready for a 'bazaar' experience."
,,Good,3.0,,Once upon a Time Mustafa was the best but now is not bad as one can do most of the shopping under one roof and also is open 24 Hours. But do remember that it is not the cheapest as it use to be - specially if buying expensive items.
,,Sorry,1.0,,"Not for me, or my partner sorry, just felt wrong , a large array of products , but in a haphazard manner , felt grimy , did not enjoy and left , quickly"
,,"Big, and good for food shopping only.",3.0,,"was in this 'supermarket' in October 2015, and found it to be the most confusing shop I have ever been in. trying to get to different floors is a nightmare, and the old layout is not shopper friendly at all, and neither are most of the staff, who seem to be hostile towards tourists. However, it looks good for cheap food shopping."
,,"Interesting for foreigners, but not for Turkish people",3.0,,"Because we, Turkish people, are used to seeing this kind of shopping malls in old Istanbul towns, this is nothing new for us. It can be interesting for foreigners, though. I still can't believe everything is original there. Many of them look fake. Wouldn't buy anything from there but water"
,,Cheap shopping 24/7!,4.0,,"During our 5-day stay in Singapore last November 2015, we visit Mustafa every night to buy chocolates and perfumes! The chocolates were surprisingly cheap even if it's branded (Cadbury, Ferrero, KitKat, Hersheys). They're much cheaper than the ones in airport duty-free. What really made me love this place is the price of perfumes. They have this buy one take one promo for some perfumes for only 50 SGD. I also bought a couple of VS mists which only costs 12 SGD each. This is a must visit place especially when you are into chocolates and souvenirs!"
,,Very large department store in the Little India area of Singapore,4.0,,"Mustafas seems to be an institution in the Little India area of Singapore It is very large over several adjoining buildings and often types of items sold in each building can be replicated at the other buildings
Almost anything imaginable is sold there at very reasonable prices
Items such as watches are a little more expensive than the street stalls and markets but the quality seems a little better and Mustafas offer a guarantee on all items purchased The Indian staff are very helpful and were I buying an expensive item of jewellery electrical item or the like to me the little extra paid at Mustafas would be well worthwhile knowing the quality would be more likely to be better than if bought at a street stall or market The buildings are air conditioned so the store is a haven to escape Singapores humidity"
,,Bigger than you think.,4.0,,"This place goes up, goes down and quite a bit horizontally. Just when you think you've come to the end, there's another opening to even more aisles of goods. The store is.as others have said, crowded and cluttered. There are groceries, clothing, electronics and darn near anything else. Locals seem to shop there while tourists like me can find a number of souvenirs."
,,Retire women,4.0,,Cheap sruff good for get some souvenir. I got the same things as I found at Orchard but they was 3 times cheaper.
,,you can find almost everything here!,4.0,,"i think you can find almost everything here. clothes, toiletries, electrical appliances, souvenirs, groceries and money changer."
,,Bargain Shopping,3.0,,"Just wandering around Mustafa's is an experience in itself. This shop is a real emporium. But don't expect anything fancy. You are met at the door by security who will seal up with cable ties any bags that you might be carrying. The multi story complex is jam packed with stock from, watches, electrical, clothes, souvenirs, bags, groceries and much more. The aisles are tight and a map would come in handy. An astonishing array of products."
,,Literally has EVERYTHING!,5.0,,"This really is a one stop shop, but be prepared to spend a whole day there. Anything you need or never even thought you needed is here! There is so much to see, and the floor entirely dedicated to gold sales is unbelievable. Would highly recommend this for anyone wishing to escape the heat and get lost in the retail world"
,,If looking for cheap stuff,4.0,,"If you are hunting for cheap but non guaranteed stuff, this is the place to be. Also, the area around is famous for good Indian food in Singapore."
,,Get everything under a single roof,5.0,,"24 hour shopping, Get everything under one roof. The exchange centre perhaps gives you the best forex rates in Singapore. The shopping centre offers everything you wish to buy and you are assured of the best prices."
,,Cheap shopping hilariously souvenirs from Singapore,3.0,,"To arrive at the Mustafa Center can use the MRT and alight at Little India station, just walk up on the Mall Mustafa. Always filled with tourists, because the stuff here is pretty cheap compared to other places in Singapore. Such as clothing, watches, shoes, perfume and various souvenirs available. In front of the Mustafa Center is also a quite cheap hotel, Fortuna Hotel (stayed at this hotel in 2011) but it is also close to the mosque (for the Muslims do not have to worry to find a place of prayer, there is a mosque Angullia near Mustafa Center). Hungry...a lot of places to eat, stay looking to taste and halal."
,,A shopping experience for days,5.0,,"Previous descriptions I had read about Mustafa Center never prepared me for what I'd experience. lt's as if you combined Walmart, Best buy, along with an Indian supermarket multiply by 10! It's not for the faint of heart or the weak of knees but it can be a great adventure particularly for the foodie looking for just about any spice imaginable or for cheap souvenirs. The amount of stuff does make the aisles crowded if not cramped. And when you think, you've reached the end, around the corner will be even more store. This place is 24 hours because it would take you a week to make sure everyone is out. You'll need sunglasses for the beaming light of the gold jewelry section. There are cashiers throughout the building and you can make purchases at any time. They will place a quick tie on the bag to mark that you've paid.

i'm told don't go on Sunday evenings but 2am on just about any other day is a pretty good time to go. Bring great walking shoes and anticipate spending way more time then you planned as you 1) you can't see the sun and 2) you're find yourself entranced by the variety of items for sale."
,,Bargain shopping at its' best and worst.,3.0,,"Just wandering around Mustafa's is an experience in itself. This shop is a real emporium. But don't expect anything fancy. You are met at the door by security who will seal up with cable ties any bags that you might be carrying. The multi story complex is jam packed with stock from, watches, electrical, clothes, souvenirs, bags, groceries and much more. The aisles are tight and a map would come in handy. An astonishing array of products."
,,Heart of Little India,4.0,,"Google and Tripadvisor will recommend (correctly) that the best exchange rates for currency are available at Mustafa Centre. The rates are at least a couple of decimal points higher (or lower, depending on your transaction) as compared to other city exchange centres and much better than at Airport. Use the money exchangers inside the centre, where the crowd is much less as opposed to the exchange counters at ground level. The centre itself is an excellent mall. Electronic items are available at highly discounted prices. Caveat Emptor is my word of advice to buyers."
,,The Biggest Indian Supermarket,3.0,,"Mustafa centre is the biggest super market located in Little india area of Singapore. It is massive by combining several buildinds and blocks accross roads as well. It is not an upscale mall but selling every thing at bargain price. It is very crowdy on holidays. Consider it as indian brand (hyperstar or carefore). Being a tourist i didn't needed supermarket stuff as most of stuff was crap but their huge luggage section attracted my attention. I also bought food stuff of india not avaiable in my country.
The best part is that its a 24/7 so when the singapore's hussle bustle ends go for Mustafa centre to shop."
,,Shop for no reason,4.0,,"Recently I visited this place with my family. You can find almost everything here from daily necessities to branded watches. This is not the luxurious shopping place, but for bargain hunters.
We picked up some kitchen items and bath products which were cheaper than other places in the town.

You can easily spend hours if you like shopping, but be ready to walk around crowds."
,,Shoppers paradise for Indian tourists,5.0,,It is the Crown of Little India. I have visited it again after 10 years and was not amazed to see it as crowded as was earlier. A wonderful place. Good for shoppers from Indian sub continent.
,,Busy and dirty,3.0,,"This is a very large shopping centre with many bargains but I would not say it is an enjoyable shopping centre. There are better quality goods elsewhere, however, if you looking the catch a bargain and don't mind the hustle and bustle, then this may be the place for you. If you are looking for a good music store as I was, visit the peninsula hotel basement shopping centre. Here you will find dave's music store which has everything along with a lot of other music stores in the basement, also music tee shirts - great rock n roll gear."
,,A crowded store,2.0,,"Located in a crowded Little India district in Singapore, it is a shopping center that sells virtually everything and opens 24 hours. It is a favorite haunt for tourists and blue collar workers from Indian subcontinents. Many local Singaporeans avoid this place and many have never come close this place since it can be very crowded especially on weekends and public holidays but if you are an adventurous type who don't mind crowded markets, you may like this shopping center. However if you prefer a cozy, serene, classy shopping experience, avoid this place at all cost."
,,One stop shopping,5.0,,"If you are looking for bargains in Singapore, this is the place to go. More than one Million different articles under one roof at budget prices. Whatever you are looking for, you can porbably get at the Mustafa Centre. But be ware, it can be very crowded and walking space is limited. Easy to avoid shopping rush hours, the center is open 24 Hrs a day 7 Days a week.Love to go there even to just to look around and buy many things you can not find anywhere else, exotic spices, western food, garments for almost any culture in the world, cosmetics, apparel, you name it they got it.If you are looking for flashy fancy shops, this is not the place to go but with the same budget you will end up with far more excess luggage then elsewhere. Love the place, it is buzzing 24 Hrs a day."
,,A lot of isles,3.0,,"Was looking for perfume and asked a local would you recommend she advised yes, I asked her would you buy electrical from here she says no. I found sporting goods Brand names Adidas,Nike etc quite expensive if you look in the department stores on Orchard Road they have a few sales on."
,,The biggest shopping centre,4.0,,"This store is the biggest store in singapore. One can find everything in this store. This is the best store for indian, chinese, singapore and thai goods at cheap rates. The store is open 24 hours and is located in the heart of singapore."
,,Retail therapy,4.0,,"Being a chap who soon gets bored doing retail therapy,this suited me down to the ground never seen nothing like this ever before they sell nearly everything but you really have to look for it so it makes it even more interesting don't be confused on entry you think you have to leave any bags you have at the door but they put tie wraps on them to make sure you can't put anything in them when you buy anything they do the same with the bag they put it in enjoy you retail therapists!!!!!"
,,Disappointing Shopping Experience,2.0,,"I remember having visited Mustafa in 2006 when it was a much happening place, but now it is no more a bargain shopping place. The prices are on the higher side and the product quality is suspect. You can get more counterfeit items in Mustafa than any where else in Singapore. The sales persons are badly trained and do not show much interest in showing the products and are poor communicators. The chocolates bought from Mustafa was of horrible quality an had to throw them away. The items are cluttered and haphazardly placed. It must be one of the most unclean place in Singapore. The store needs a thorough re haul of the management or else it will soon become a relic of the past"
,,Fabric shopping,3.0,,"We visited with a female friend from Australia who wanted quilting fabric. Huge selection of Indonesian batik on 3rd floor from S$4 a metre. Also silks, sari fabric, cotton, etc, floor to ceiling.
Lots of cheap clothing, but be careful, ""large"" sizing was quite small compared to chain-store sizing."
,,Souvenir,4.0,,"Good place to look for souvenir, open 24h, always crowded. For tourist don't forget to get gst refund on basement 2nd. Happy shopping"
,,Don't expect it to be a serene experience,4.0,,"This is a ""one stop shop"" for anything you can think of buying. It is a tightly packed 5-6 stories of shelves from groceries to 65"" TVs to underwear. Get ready to bump into fellow shoppers. The price is quite reasonable and there is a huge selection. We got a Samsonite hard-case 69"" for 449SGD and outside at Samsonite Singapore and other stores it was around 700. We bought some kids shoes too which were a little more expensive in a nice mall compared to Mustafa Centre. Even though the product was original the sales person was not as genuine as he lied to us saying that this price is only for today, but we took the chance and bought it for the same price the next :-). Also some of the stuff like bags etc. are ripoffs, be very careful when buying such stuff. They also have good assortment of confectionaries quite reasonably priced. Electronics also can be of varied quality, they cater to the entire price spectrum so you can find the best as well as the cheapest lying side by side. It is not a serene experience but you can get everything in one place and if you need that therapeutic shopping experience go to a nice mall, which we too did."
,,Never ending shopping experiance....,5.0,,"This is truly the largest shopping facility we have ever seen, 7 floors of just about anything you can think of. If you are needing shoes be prepared to hike through a full floor with rows and rows of all sorts of shoes, which is the same for all the other products on sale, from food items to toiletries, to clothing, to souvenirs, to spices ALL TYPES, and best of all is the reasonable prices. After hours of shopping, tired legs and toes, take a tip to the top floor, for a good Indian meal at affordable prices. Definitely one of the places to put at the top of your list of shopping venues. Accessible by MRT, Bus or taxi."
,,Not My Cup of Tea,1.0,,"I heard so much about this Centre, sorry to say this is not a place to go if you want quality stuff. Give me Primark anytime. I felt suffocated especially in the women dept. Market in uk sells better quality clothes."
,,Awesome Global Shopping Center,4.0,,- Huge Shopping Center - Whole day to Spend - from Chocolates to Grocery - Electronics to perfumes - Great place to shop - Prices are Cheap !!!!
,,1 place for all your needs,5.0,,first place to visit in Singapore ... has everything you want ... perfect place ... brought toys for my son but i think could have brought much more ... next time perhaps ... very good ....
,,Yikes!,2.0,,"We heard it was THE place to go for cheap shopping in Singapore, so we were curious enough to make the trip (closest MRT stop: Farrar Place). If you like low quality stuff in a dingy shopping mall all stuffed into shelves, then this might be for you. We felt completely put off by it. Much prefer the atmosphere at Bugis over this shopping mall."
,,One stop shopping - for rush shoppers,4.0,,"This store contains everything you can think of. But you have to be careful about picking quality items..prices are reasonable ( nothing really cheap ). Check your item carefully for quality, size etc before paying at counter..I purchased two shorts but after returned to Hotel, found both were not to standard sizes and one was damaged. Went back for exchange..glad sales associate did it..but not guaranteed for other items..shop at your risk."
,,A true shopper's stop,5.0,,This sprawling store in Singapore stretched over streets and storeys simply serves the needs of any customer. The best store for Indians to get any Indian product (more specifically food related) to bring glory to Little India. The range of Indian food items available here are hardly seen in any store in India.
,,Mad Mix of Anything You Could Ever Imagine,3.0,,"This place is massive and, for a while, we were ""trapped"" in the food section. Even this was fun, looking to see the various local food stuffs that they had for sale. In the end, we found our way back into the main store and bought a range of things: body cream because i had run out, a small reading lamp to clip to my books, 14 metal cups because my husband likes them and 4 small, wide necked flasks for my thick smoothies back home. Something for everyone."
,,Hype for nothing!,2.0,,"Now your experience at Mustafa depends on who you are: a person based in S'pore or a traveler.

If you're the former, then ofcourse its a one stop shop for daily needs.

If however, you're the latter, the visit will leave you wondering what's wrong with all the people who advised a visit. Real Estate is extremely dear in Spore and may be that's why more and more has been stocked in less and lesser. There are tall stacks, put close together, full of stuff. At best it gives you a feel of being in a godown and worst it can make you feel claustrophobic.

You're travelling to Spore for a holiday. For sure there are a thousand better things to explore than to spend even an hour here. Also, if you feel you can get a good deal on those little take-homes for your entire family - beware - even the chocs are disappointing. Its tempting to pick up those SGD 2 bars but they turn out real bad. The bags and purses also reek of poor quality. Watches could be given a try, if at all.

Overall, it was worse than our Big Bazaar. No exaggeration. Not recommended.

China Bazaar is recommended instead."
,,Five floors of whatever you could wish to buy!,2.0,,"This place is well known in singapore as a department store with everything... How they manage stock levels who knows...

Could do your head in if you are looking for space to view things...

And watch out apparently you get no warranty on stuff from here according to our local friendly taxi driver"
,,Good place to shopping with 24 hour,4.0,,It good place too shopping anytime you want and a lot of products with India seller. But place not it not so really clean and messy I recommend for who looking to buy products with reasonable price and cheap.
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Mustafa centre has been a blessing for Indian seafarers. Singapore being Asian country I get all the stuff I get in Mumbai.
,,24 hours shopping hub for all,5.0,,This place is really a paradise for the shoppers. This hub is open 24 hours. One can buy mostly everything. The some other facilities are also available here like foreign currency changer and travel services. This mall is located in Little India in Singapore. There are many restaurants around this attraction. The large number of varieties as a choice for every product are available in this mall. You will find many fruits and vegetable varieties from across the world along with other edible products. You can also buy jewelry from Mustafa centre.
,,"One stop Shop, Amazing Variety",4.0,,"One stop Supermarket for everything. Indian groceries, food,meat, veggies, clothes, jewellary, elcctronics and many many more spanning across several floors.

You need half a day to explore all, a landmark in Singapore located in little india. Many good restaurants opposite the building so very good shopping destination.
Must visit while in Singapore."
,,Must visit shopping paradise of Singapore,4.0,,This is must visit spot for all ages ! Starting from the shoes it has all available for all types of people ! It is multi storage building situated in the famous area named Little India in Singapore
,,Everything - Every-time Shopping,4.0,,"What's about to say here... Just amazing you can get nearly everything in this overcrowed, overstuffed shopping mall. The prices are very competitive compared to other shopping malls in SG. Just worth a try, I was heading there for some consumer electronics and was surprised about the offers. Hit this mall when you walk through little india."
,,Nice visit and really good restaurant at the top,4.0,,We ate there during lunch and liked it a lot. The shopping opportunities at mustafa are special. Enjoyed it a lot.
,,"Jet lagged , 24 hours open..",4.0,,"I went with my son to Singapore, at first...my son used to sleep on the day and wake up on the night.. so my only escape was this place.
Cheap and nice gifts. you should go to this place and buy the gifts and get it over with ..then go and have fun for your self ."
,,One Place to get every Item you can imagin,3.0,,"Its a Multi Storied Huge store where all items that you can imagin is available here. It is not so crowded that you can not move around inside. All shops on all stories are open for 24 hours and no walls between each counter. Prices were very high compared to india. For example I just purchased a 32 GB pendrive from amazon.in in india at 610/- before leaving india, but the same item was available at Rs 1100/-. VIP banian available in india at Rs 100 appx was sold at Rs 300/- there. Chocolates were also costly. I then went to China Town market where things were cheap as per singapore standard. 1 Singapore Dollar is equivalent to Rs 47 Appx which is also one of the reason why indian find everything costly there. One must visit Mustafa Centre but buying must be done at China Town or Little India road."
,,"Disappointing prices, more $$ than Perth",1.0,,We visited because we had read online blogs and reviews that we could buy cheaper iPhones here. Nope they were more expensive (and were grey items with no international warranty) than buying outright from an Australian Apple Store. Waste of a trip :( Everything else was just a large version of The Reject Shop or priced as high as Australia.
,,A Good Shopping Mall,4.0,,"This is most famous and economic Mall in Singapore. Here you can get every thing including clothes, provosion et round the clock i.e. 24 hours. Our luggage was not received and left at bombay airport due to poor management of Malasian Airlines, we purchased clothes for one day at arrival dy at midnight. Recommended to visit as it is a cheaper mall."
,,Interesting shopping mall.,3.0,,This mall has everything crammed into it. I was told that cameras may be cheaper here but found this not to be the case. Lower end electronics seemed to cheaper here though.
,,Pin to Bed - Every thing at one place,4.0,,"Their policy toward their staffs really impressed me ( attached )
this was the first place I visited in Singapore and you would get literally every item you would expected to buy as a tourist and also as a local. Different varieties from low cost, mid range and luxury items. Forex and availability of restaurants nearby is a great advantage and it is in hear of little India.

Staffs can talk tamil, Malayalam, hindi and english"
,,Average,3.0,,It has most of items which is required for household. Average service and average maintaneance. Since we get all in one roof happy to go
,,"A junk emporium, loved it.",3.0,,"The Mustafa Centre is a must see if you have a spare couple of hours. It's full of stuff you never knew you needed, I defy anybody, yes anybody, to visit here and leave without buying something. We went and I bought a new belt, a pair of insoles for my trainers and a pair of flip flops. My wife bought a pair of shoes with owls pattern and an 8 GB card for her camera ( we already have 6 ).
Great place, loved it, but not that much."
,,Shopping centre at the heart of little india,3.0,,The main shopping centre in little india in Singapore. Its annoying that you have to leve your bag outside. You are also warned of shoplifters in this area. Prices didn't seem that attractive.
,,Not for Tourists,3.0,,"Its a Big Store with virtually everything you will need, but I fail to understand why Tourists need to visit this store, unless you forgot something to carry with with you there is no reason to visit this Shop."
,,Gigantic Mall,4.0,,"My parents having visited Mustafas in the early 90's couldn't believe how gigantic it has got over the years. We went there almost every day while we were in Singapore simply because our hotel was just across the street.

We found that shoes and cosmetic items were rather cheap and also the food items. Others were not that cheap and I found that the clothes were looking cheap and out of fashion.

You will definitely get lost in this huge mall. ;)"
,,Get your elbows out,4.0,,"How do you describe Mustafa's, the gigantic everything store in the Little India district of Singapore. Maybe by contrast; Singapore, the spiritual home of the antiseptic shopping center has somehow given birth to the anti-shopping center, Mustafa's. Yes, the brand names are there, but crammed together onto shelves and into bins, just as if real estate were actually expensive in Singapore. And so much more. An entire wall of flashlights. A little enclave for saris. And my wife's personal favorite, rack after rack of beautiful sarongs, all for under $10.00.

Yes, it's crowded at any normal hour, but hey, it's open 24 hours, and from my personal experience, I can tell you the crowds ain't so bad at 3:00 am. Yes, the lines at the checkout counter are only made bearable by the variety of people standing in them. Yes, the help comes from the Harvard Square School of Service, as sullen as they are incomprehensible. But this is Mustafa's. If you don't like one building full of goods, well then, go to another."
,,Huge is a small word,4.0,,"Literally, Mustafa Centre is gigantic!
Think about 95% of the things that Anyone would want ever. .you got it!
You need a lot of time, a lot of energy and stamina, even if you are a shopaholic!
Out of 2 hours that I could manage there, I was at the chocolates section only for 45 minutes- it is so huge and gives you mind boggling choices to make.
I went in at just before 12 am and it was still decently crowded. Came out around 2 am and found cabs lined up literally outside. Fun place to be in. Also, the prices are way cheaper than the airport or a regular shop ( a bag of mixed miniatures -snickers ,mars,bounty etc cost me a little below $8 and the same was available at the airport for $16). Also I believe that the perfumes are ever so slightly cheaper at Mustafa.
You have a line of restaurants outside it and won't have any trouble finding a place to eat at. Right now the main road is beautifully decorated owing to the upcoming Hindu festival of Diwali."
,,need to choose specific items only,3.0,,"Bargain is worth for certain items only, cheese cheap, kellogs cheap, perfumes cheaper, clothes, toys, electronic items etc expensive and not worth it buying there and carrying all the way home when you can buy them lot less cheaper in sri lanka,even in singapore there are other places you can shop cheaper but will have to tavel more.overall, for asians wont be a good bargain as rated here."
,,"Can't find it here, won't find it elsewhere in Singapore",4.0,,"It's a saying in Singapore, but truly you can find almost anything you'd think of in the vast Mustafa shopping mall. Everything is sharply priced and you won't find any fakes here. We definitely had a good time shopping here. Try the cosmetics sections, you can find some amazing deals."
,,24*7 and huge,5.0,,If you want a 24*7 shopping and a place where you can shop literally for anything this is the place to be. It has 5 floors with virtually everything you wanna buy. a must visit if you wanna shop
,,Mustafa Centre: One stop place for shopping,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre, Singapore, is a great place to do your shopping- from groceries, medical needs, souvenirs, electronic items and gadgets, jewellery, clothes, etc.
It is not a swanky place like other top shopping malls in Singapore, but the prices are really reasonable if you do a comparison. The best thing is everything you need to buy is under one roof. The only downside is you really have to look around carefully to get the best buy since the place is HUGE. Keep your impulses in check. You really need to spend some time at Mustafa. By the way, the money changers at Mustafa offer one of the best foreign exchange rates here. It is also open 24/7."
,,"24x7 shopping, Reasonable, Everything",5.0,,"This is a shoppers paradise in the true sense. And the reason is because it does not show-off in its outlook and does not scare possibly the normal middle-class shopper. There is something for everyone in this EVERYONE mall.
- It is open 24x7 so that makes shopping so much more fun and trust me at 12 AM, it will be crowded like anything.
- There is cheap food, money changers offering Forex at the best rates and even a terrace restaurant
- The best buys here in order are - The Luggage Section (Awesome variety at all budgets), The Watches, Electronics (primarily Cameras) and the Fragrances (there is no one hounding you to try an expensive perfume like in malls and they have testers for everything) and then finally the groceries. The Electronics section would sell a lot of local or cheap Chinese goods. Try and avoid that.
- Public Transport is available and you can get down at the Farrer Park MRT (not Little India).
- However after 11 PM, you would ofcourse only need to depend on Local Taxis. There is a surcharge no that, so be mindful of the same

The only con is that there is so much of stuff on display, there is little space to move around and that has been the case for years. You better search for a trolley first because they are difficult to find and the washrooms are at the fag end of a floor.

Do remember if you are buying big here, carry your passport with you. You can apply for GST refund here. They have a dedicated counter in the LGF.

Happy Shopping."
,,Mixed feelings,3.0,,"A huge variety of interesting stuff - a huge variety of junk.
I would avoid all the cheap electronics of Chinese origin - the failure rate seems very high
The gold section is amazing - huge variety & styles
Dont go on a Sunday - the store gets overcrowded

There are better , cheaper , more reliable places to shop in Singapore"
,,Try out for 24x7 shopping,4.0,,"The things are not price competitive. For buying gifts, tourist can depend on shops near to Sri Veeraswamy temple. Everyone will recommend only Mustafa centre, but the shops near to Sri Veeraswamy are price competent."
,,All in one place for everything Indian,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a huge market, at multiple levels, packed to the core and the cheapest source everything Indian - groceries, vegetables, snacks, spices - and a whole lot of other products. Practically anything, clothes, electronics, hardware, toiletries, shoes, jewelry, foreign exchange - you name it and it is there. All Indian tourist flock to the Market and the shops lined across the street for their shopping. The souvenir shops are packed with a wide range of products and have a great bargains. And the street id packed with a lot of good Indian restaurants. A must visit place for all tourists."
,,whole world at one place at reasonable price.,5.0,,a must place for shopping when in singapore. u can shop for @ days to see the whole variety of offerings they have. total of three mall buildings. u can get anything u need for urself.
,,"Expensive Shopping, not worth the visit!",3.0,,"We found Mustafa to be very expensive than other stores around Singapore. Go to fairprice in chinatown for your daily needs, chocolates, coffee, etc. The only convinience at Mustafa is you find everything at one place and open 24 hrs, which helps when you are pressed of time. The money exchanger at Mustafa offers one of the best deals."
,,Everything You can Imagine,4.0,,"From Needles to Noodles, you can find anything here, there is a lot of variety, it can be over crowded, its open for 24 hours, People from all over Singapore come here to buy things for their homes. There is a lot of Variety."
,,Shopping and shopping for cheap,3.0,,"Guys, nice place to go if you are looking for cheap stuff. And by cheap, I mean dirt cheap in terms of quality. Nothing much to see, enormous place. Found the the cashiers are extremely rude to tourists. I have personally witnessed two tourists being totally ignored and yelled at when they tried to ask a simple question for a price check. Not worthed to see."
,,Indian and Arabian Area,4.0,,"We just look around, not shopping here because I choose shop at Bugis street. But I love to get food here. I love the culinairy."
,,Everything under the sun you can imagine is here!,4.0,,"Money changer, winter clothing, adaptors for travel, pharmaceuticals, travel agent for even small airline in Indonesia months in advance, clothes, shoes, goggles, in other words, one sprawling place has anything you need at low prices near the Farrer Park NE Line MRT station, 10 minutes walk from the Little India station. Amazing place!
Drawback--narrow aisles and little English spoken. Bring a sample or write down what you need."
,,Not an attraction but a different shopping experience,3.0,,"I would not recommend this place as an attraction, however, its a great location for shopping as you will find everything under one roof (if you have time and patience to browse ). Also it has a good collection of souvenirs for the last minute shopping.

The variety of goods and equally wide variety of brands you can find in one place is amazing, and this is the only shopping centre in Singapore which is open 24 hours.

However, it is super crowded during weekends and the shopping space is congested."
,,Huge variety but not extraordinary prices,3.0,,"Equal to its reputation where huge variety of products can be found. However, no big deals on prices - no deals at all would say except on some specific articles"
,,Market style shopping,3.0,,"Mustafa Center offers market style shopping in an enclosed building, with a large variety of souvenirs, clothes (medium quality but very low prices), food, and electronics.
If you're looking for any of the above it's a great place to avoid the weather, but for high quality goods or a good shopping atmosphere, try elsewhere."
,,Full of clutter ....bad products bad experience,1.0,,"i visited Mustafa centre last week during my visit to Singapore (bcoz of so much hype around).... it was too crowded and racks were cluttered with products with no one to help....
I still managed to buy some chocolate slabs but when i opened the packs after coming back to India, all were full of insects and webs inside. :(
i was left with no other option then to throw them away.... total waste of money, time and efforts..... i regret my decision of choosing Mustafa over dutyfree shops...."
,,The less glitzy side of Singapore - must see,5.0,,"We loved Mustafa Centre! It has everything you could possibly want and need... and more. The selection is incredible. Sure we wouldn't buy expensive items here, but it's perfect for gifts to bring back home. It does take a very long time to find what you're looking for though. There's even a 24-hour foreign exchange counter (very handy for travellers).

The other reviewers found the surrounding area (Little India) and the centre itself shady and unclean, but we think this is the other side of Singapore, without the glitz and glamour of Orchard Rd. We enjoyed strolling in the neighbourhood and the centre and seeing how the less wealthy Singaporeans lived. Never did we feel unsafe. We didn't find the cashiers or store assists rude either. Although the aisles are fairly close together, the centre is by no means unkempt and dirty. Everything is neatly organized and cleanly packaged. It's a must see in Singapore!"
,,"Huge market for Everything, but pricey",3.0,,"This place has everything under the sun except maybe firearms. You can get electronics, clothes, medications, housewares and so forth and it is huge. You could get lost inside. The only problem is there didn't seem to be any great deals. Everything was priced pretty much MSRP. Maybe it was good prices for Singapore though. We didn't do too much shopping anywhere else."
,,place where you can find anything!,4.0,,"a big market having anything you might need! gold, clothes chocolates, perfumes... anything.. you name it, it will be there! but the only thing is that you might get lost during the search.
perfumes and chocolates are in abundance, tourist can also have the gst refund from there itself."
,,A very large department store on edge of Little India.,4.0,,"If you are visiting Little India and feel like browsing around a shop which seems to sell everything, this is the place to visit. Children would soon get bored so I would advise you not to drag them along with you! Security is very tight to deter shoplifters, so don't take it personally."
,,extremely repressive,1.0,,"I don’t understand why Mustafa centre is nominated has a must to visit in Singapore, this place It’s like a typical warehouse with a million items neglected in a disorderly fashion. Of course there are cheap items available here...but not worth the money that you pay. The place around is extremely repressive. It’s would be probably the only unclean place in Singapore! This place should be avoid, Buyer beware! The environment is not good, people are rude, and they won’t even look at you when you talk to them, just wasted of time, really not recommended for shopping. There are better malls elsewhere. Avoid the place at all cost."
,,One stop shop,3.0,,Buy everything under single floor. try to visit at night as it remains open round the clock. not extra ordinary but work a visit.
,,A rabbits warren of cheap articles,2.0,,"As the title states this multi-storey building is jam packed with cheap articles from clothes to pharmacy to electronics. The aisles are barely negotiable between times for sale with a strong musty smell one feels that you get what you will be asked to pay for. An inferior item.
Would not return"
,,"Different experience,Scary people",1.0,,"Get real , this place is a full discount store and everything is either placed here because it cannot sold elsewhere or because some shady deal has been done.
Why does the Honest Singapore Government have this kind of shop?This place is a fire hazard with people who cannot speak a basic level of English.Most of the Employees are from outside Singapore.Most of the items can be bought cheaper elsewhere.
Only a few things are worth.Most of all four of us who went together, two of us lost contact with each other.Ofcourse we were helped by the Supermarket Security service but the height of the counter racks was the primary cause. Many people loose their family members too by what we heard on the supermarket announcement.Other reviews talk of the maze.Also do note there are huge crowds.Only for people who want to see another country and civilization need to enter this shopping maze."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This place sells everything and I believe it is open 24/7. I found trousers here I couldn't find anywhere else.
,,The place to shop,5.0,,Ok comparatively cheap prices And you have cheap to high end stuff But the wait on getting staff to show you the stuff esp electronics is a bit of a drag
,,the only mall 24 hours in singapore,5.0,,"what u want,everthing can get here beside beer and cigarete because this is halal mall,clothes,gold,money changer,food court,a lot more u can shopping here,if for me one day is not enaf to finish shopping at this mall"
,,The best supermarket,5.0,,"it's a 24 hours supermarket, located near little India district. I've visited many supermarkets in SG, but this one have the most variety of items, with tax-refund (reach at least SG 50$)."
,,"Huuuuuuge store, with almost everything you may want",3.0,,"The place is huge. Really really huge. Larger than most hypermarkets I've ever been. But it has very narrow corridors, and signs are a little confusing. Some items are really cheaper than in other places, but most of the comparable items are just the same price that you would find in small economic markets."
,,Shopping for insomniacs and hard-core shoppers,3.0,,"To survive the happy, mayhem-inducing chaos that is Mustafa (wait they have 4 malls now), have a clear idea of what specific products and prices of items you are looking for, specially tech specs and voltage for electronics. Shopping in here is best for hardened shoppers not afraid of pushy crowds and abusive sales personnel. Said sales staff are sick of answering endless questions of idiot buyers who know nothing about what they are trying to purchase. Be knowledgeable and stick to your list. Come back only if you have done your product research.

Jewellery display locks down by midnight. Makes sense.

But the mall gets much less crowded in the wee hours and you can take your time sifting thru the endless variety of stuff in case you do have the time and luggage allowance for loot. And the insomniacs sales staff do have helpful gems who remember they are there to be helpful in order to assist parting you from your money.

If bringing menfolk, leave them be to hunt their stuff and leave shortly. Better yet go shopping without the menfolk so you can take all the time you want. 24-hour restaurants across the street have nice food to revitalise yourself in between shopping."
,,Amazing Place Cheapest Shopping,5.0,,This has got to be the cheapest shopping in Singapore. Opened 24/7 from Jewelry to technology they have it all. Just make sure you know what you want and I doubt you will find it cheaper elsewhere
,,Above average price and poor service,1.0,,"I came to Mustafa center thinking it has everything in one play for great prices. The first thing you'll notice is the center is made up of a number of separate buildings with various entrances. Don't worry, they all interconnect through the basement or upper levels.

Once you get to the door, you will be greeted by security. If you're not carrying a bag, great, come right through. Now if you are a tourist, like me, with a bag, then they'll have to search your bag. I was curious and inquired about the reason of the search. Finally the 3rd guard said it's to prevent theft. Which, to me does not make sense. For a center that supposedly sells everything, how does searching customer's bags prior to entry prevent theft? Anyhow, after finding my haft empty water bottle, camera, snacks, maps, guide books, and a number of souvenir items I bought earlier that day, they were satisfied that theft will have been prevented. So in I went.

The first area I happened upon appeared to be selling pharmaceuticals, balms, vitamins etc. Just upstairs is the bakery (don't buy the samosas). Then it's chocolates, cookies and various other sweets. Prices generally are more expensive than elsewhere by 10-15%. For those Singapore souvenirs you are so anxious to get your hands on, save your money. Head over to China Town. More selection there and much cheaper.

Then I went down to the sporting goods department (basement by the toys). Here there is various selections for a good number of athletic activities. However, here as in elsewhere in Mustafa Center, quality is lacking to say the least. I picked up a couple of things for the kids to occupy themselves during time off from exploring. Added up to $20.90. I gave the cashier a $50 and $1 coin. She yanked the $50 from me and refused to take the $1. No explanation. Proceeded to give me change of $29.10, applied the notorious pull-ties to the plastic bag and throws in down the other end of the counter. I was confused, was it something I bought? I shrugged it off and told myself that I'm sacrifice service for a bargain.

I next visited the cell phone department. Mind you it is a feat in and of itself to navigate the maze-like halls of Mustafa Center. Don't bother with the signs, I find they lead always the wrong way. I guess it makes sense as the longer you're in there the more likely you'll buy stuff. Cell phone. We had initially planned on taking only 2 cell phones to minimize packing for the long trip. One for the wife and I and one for the kids. But my wife wanted to take advantage of the Starhub Tourist sim card so I went to buy another phone for her. There were about 6-7 men working the counter. You'll spot them by their light blue shirts. I tried to get attention of a couple of them, but was waved off. I tried to ask a couple other guys who were just standing by themselves staring across the room. Same response; pointed to a guy helping a customer with a couple more waiting. Okay, I guess everyone is on their break. Finally once my turn came I asked to see a phone. The rep took out the phone and tossed it on the counter. I tried to ask about its functions etc., but the only thing he can, or was willing to, tell me was to look at the price tag for more info. So I decided on a Samsung S Duos for $250. He wrote sales slip and told me to go to cashier to pay. (By the way, if after reading this you still decide to buy there make sure you tell them you want to claim GST refund). After payment I came back to pick up my phone. He took the receipt stamps as goods received and gave me a horribly dented box. I am not a picky buyer, but I don't think there is a side that was not dented. Considering I'm buying a relatively sensitive piece of electronic, I asked him for another unit. He said, ""don't have."" I pointed out the entire stack of 25-30 of the same model. I even told him black/white is fine. He said, ""no cannot."" Then I told him I don't want the phone. Reluctantly, he got me another unit. He proceeded to open the unit and showed me the phone is there and working. This is all and well except there's no exchange/refund unless the item is still sealed.

Feeling I have had enough tourist abuse for the day, I decided to call it a day. It took a while to work my way out through the maze and crowd of window shoppers. Surprisingly, the fastest experience is exiting the building. I had expected another inspection for the guards, but no one asked or searched. That begs the question, what's the point of the theft-prevention search?

On top of this, I later in the week discovered the sports items i discovered I could have gotten from Plaza Singapura for under $20.

Overall, Mustafa Center has good variety of things you need (or don't). Prices consistently have been above average. Quality leaves much to be desired. Considering price is above average (must more than China Town), I don't think it is worth your time to put to put up with hostile, indifferent and unfair treatment of customers. Save your time, and money, folks and go somewhere else. If not for the price then for the experience.

If you still keen on visiting Mustafa Center, because you're on different timezone, then go, but leave the wallet at home."
,,Shopaholic with insomnia? this is for you,4.0,,"Crazy place, like a market only indoors, lots of people and stuff, lots of stuff. Don't go here if you have been in other malls or plazas, you will be disappointed in the layout and demeanour of sellers etc. This is the place for nearly everything you could want and opened 24 hours, so if your a shopaholic insomniac this will possibly be your Nirvana."
,,Great fun,4.0,,"We didn't manage to look around half this place even though we visited twice. I have never seen so many suitcases in my life and there is even an aisle for umbrellas.
Even if you don't like shopping this is one of those must see places."
,,24 Hours Shopping!!!,4.0,,"Everything u need under 1 roof & the best part it's open 24/7! U can find everything from poultry to perfumes..even money changer!! The only best time to go between 1am to 8am where it's less crowded..other than that, expect overcrowding & chaos!! Also, the staff need to learn to smile..."
,,Wastage of time,1.0,,It's a uselessly hyped place to see.... we were very disappointed to see over crowded and unfriendly mall...... it looks like they have only cheap and rejected stuff.... it's wastage of time
,,mustaffa the best place in singapore!,5.0,,"mustaffa center was so good, 24 hours open for your last minute shopping! and all is available from perfume to electronics to chocolates to souvenir, everything u need is there! food was awesome! i feel like im in my own country walkin in this area, i love it"
,,Go if you have the time,3.0,,"If this is your first time in Singapore and you are hard pressed for time, give this place a skip. Its always crowded and manoeuvring a trolley is almost impossible. But, if you have time this is a nice place to visit and shop for souvenirs, chocolates, etc."
,,Its a trade off between choice and sheer inconvenience and unfriendliness,3.0,,"Mustafa today is not the famed place that people loved to go. I was surprised that my Indonesian colleagues also loved going there for the prices

We visited this on a Tuesday and I didn't like it as much as what I had seen over the years, and my colleagues who went there later in the evening also suffered.

The good points are the absolutely crazy as in super-fabulously huge range of items, especially if you are Indian/ south Asian. No other place in south East Asia can promise you this sheer range of food and groceries. Plus the big bonus plus point of it being open 24 hours!!

But its in the crowded bylanes and Mustafa has not bothered making a taxi stand and incentivizing taxis to come and collect passengers in an organized manner. So its terrible, especially if you have purchased a lot of stuff. the MRT and other options need a lot of walking to, and with those heavy bags and in the heat its sheer misery. Even worse if it rains. There is a bus stand, and the best thing to do is walk to it, and climb ANY bus and get out of there to a safer place where you can get a cab.

Also now that I have been to a few places in Indonesia, the sheer facilities that Indonesian shops that sell Oleh Oleh (souveniers and food items) is something that makes Mustafa look like a medieval primitive shopping centre.

Mustafa's staff are the un-friendliest therefore. In Indonesia when you visit a souvenir shop or foods shop, there is a dedicated counter to help you 'package or bag or even sometimes shrink wrap this in suitable cartons, that can be easily carried to your cab and in your plane. Places like Krishna in Bali help you even take these bags to your cab.

Mustafa has a lot to offer, but for folks like me its not worth the trouble."
,,Must-visit,4.0,,"Your travelling experience in Singapore wouldn't be legit without a visit to here. A 24/7 shopping mall that caters to all your needs. Its quite affordable. You can get your souvenirs here. The wide&ranging tidbits section are the most amazing (in my opinion).

You can shop for local and indian-imported snacks as well as those frizen-dinner and finger foods."
,,Best shopping experience in Singapore!,4.0,,"One of the most affordable, and complete shopping experience in Singapore. Got amazing option for everyone so you can go with your family for shopping and got exchange counter... gold and everything just buy everything at one place!"
,,mustafa centre,5.0,,For currency exchange and any travel related booking you can visit mustafa exchange. mustafa centre got everything for your shopping .
,,Rude Salesmen,1.0,,Salesmen are very rude and not helping at all. We went to buy Tissot watch and the salesman was extremely rude. Obviously decided not to buy then although had just made up our mind to buy one of 3-4 short listed watches. Would prefer not to shop at Mustafa
,,Be transported to ...,2.0,,"First off, if gold is the tall order then be there during mall hours. Our mistake was going there at around 11pm since it is open 24/7. Not!!! We ended up buying a wall plug adaptor. SG and MY has this odd three-pronged plug as standard."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Aladdin's cave for everything you could possibly want. Avoid week end as it can be a tight squeeze trying to shop. I have spent hours in here looking at all the goods, amazing. If you love fabrics, this is a place to go. Sari fabrics are beautiful. There is a small range of patchwork fabrics and dress fabrics. An amazing array of batik fabrics. Well worth a look, take your time."
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,Just go and walk through Mustafa Center there is no need to purchase as it is just the most fabulous Aladdins cave of everything. Not sure I would recommend buying anything her although I did get a linen tablecloth here which even though it was for a 10 to 12 seat table just fits my 8 seater. Gold is not cheap and you might as well buy you Electronics at home. Some great vegetarian restaurants on the side road cheap and great food
,,Interesting,4.0,,Well just like any shopping stop but it does have some pretty good bargains. You will definitely enjoy looking through the different items from make-up to coffee sachets.
,,"If they don't have it here, it doesn't exist",4.0,,"First time there, it's OVERWHELMING!!!! They have all sorts of stuff, stacked in narrow aisles from floor to ceiling. Open 24/7."
,,Not overly cheap,3.0,,"I went here during the day on Saturday to see if I could find a bargain, it was difficult to maneuver even with a basket due to the number of people.

There is alot to see all in one place. The costume jewelry can get pricey, I did better in the 3 for $10 shop across the road. Also fridge magnets are cheaper across the road too.

Tip: don't expect toilet paper if you manage to find the loo."
,,The one stop shop,5.0,,"This is the place to go to find almost anything you want. It contained clothing for people of all ages including traditional Indian garments and the usual things you would buy as gifts, like tee shirts etc. A large variety of inexpensive gifts with a particularly Singapore flavour were available: miniature merlions, Singapore flyers, purses and other items using the Singapore airline sarong kabaya materials. My husband selected three men's aftershave colognes which came to less than $100 so he is all set for the rest of his life! I could have bought jewellery, watches, cosmetics and every kind of household item if I'd had the time and luggage space. They also have a supermarket where I bought Dilmah teabags and a packet of digestive biscuits. Honestly. Whatever you want is likely to be here with the possible exception of car parts and building materials."
,,Shopping Paradise in Mustafa,5.0,,"Excellent place to buy anything and everything, as long as you are not in a rush! Difficult to find our way around but if time is plentiful then just go with the flo, Mo!"
,,This used to be a great place,2.0,,The first time I went here about 8 years ago the place was heaving with people and products so cheap all the good brands cheap as. But now its like a cheap 2 dollar shop stinking of cheap plastic goods. What a shame
,,Heaven,5.0,,"I always love being here. Cheaper from the other place. U can buy the same brand ex.cheeker green tea choc.in kuala lumpur, but more cheaper in here. Love to buy perfumes, body lotion, chocolate, and everything here."
,,"""Heaven"" chocolate",4.0,,"if you chocolate lovers, this is the place to find a wide range of chocolate with cheap price, but it whenever you want to shop is not a problem, because this place is open 24 hours nonstop and located not far from the MRT station raffles"
,,Large collection with 24/7 access to the store,5.0,,"Located in Little India, this shop is open 24/7..one of the largest mall in Singapore-- you get literally everything here under the sky..."
,,A must see,5.0,,"A must see place if you like to shop local & unexpensive. It's not a fancy place but it's very interesting and a bit mad kind of place, worth seeing at least once"
,,Shopping open for 24-hrs,5.0,,"Just imagine anything, you will find it at Mustafa Centre. Very near to SMRT Farrer Park in Little India, it has all the tourist related logistics available on reasonable price. Happy to learn that owner is from Jaunpur, UP, INDIA."
,,Modern market,4.0,,"If you want some things you can take back to your home for merchandise from Singapore, mustafa center is a right place especially if you doesn't like traditional market. Once again it's your choice"
,,average,3.0,,"You can find almost most of the things here. At the first it looks like very cheap. My friend bought few things as a souvenir. However we realized we can get at cheaper price for the same stuffs at Bugis Street.
So based on my experience I would say Mustafa Centre is not the most cheapest place to buy stuffs. You can survey at other areas like Bugis Street if you are not rushing or restricted by time. However, I am not sure if you are able to find certain stuffs like perfumes from Mustafa Centre at other places."
,,All under one enormous roof,5.0,,"If there is place the tourists and taxi drivers know in Singapore - it is Mustafa . This enormous departmental store of several floors and several,blockes offers the best of the products - jewellery , latest in electronics white goods , groceries , fresh produce, health foods at the most competive rates . The mind blowing operation of this store is all the more remarkable because the customer service is of high order ,consumer friendly , products offered top quality .- no disigners labels here . A must visit place if you love shopping . The foreign exchange counters are located in Mustafa if you wish to have money exchange . The best place to shop in Singapore ."
,,place to find everything you need,4.0,,Large collection of anything and everything you need! you may get better deals for some products than India. I normally prefer to buy some perfumes to gift. Good Indian food options nearby.
,,glimpse of A Long Long Processing issue with Mustafa Travel; Email By a Harassed passenger whom used the services of Mu,1.0,,"Dear Mr Rajiv,
Thank you for your email. However I was fully expecting a phone call from a Manager of Mr Ajmal, instead of a impersonal email that you have sent.

I absolutely do not think that you fully understand the issues & inconvenience that i am facing
1. The refund has been delayed for quite some time now.
2. I was not contacted when the refund was delayed and now upon chasing I am being told that it will be further delayed.
3. This is terrible service
4. I have been waiting for about close to 4 months to settle this issue.
5. I understand that Mustafa Travel is not responsible for the flight cancellation, however I do not understand why I am being placed through so much of inconvenience.
5. I was emailed a wrong amount, I understand the typo error and clarified it.
6. I was told that I will receive the refund by the first week of July, however no further contact was made with me.
7. Jet Airways as well did not contact me with regards to the 'compensation' they offered. ( I understand that Mustafa Travel is a different entity and this is not your problem)
8. However upon contacting Mr Ajmal on 20/07/2015, I was told it will be a further delay as waiting for Jet Airways to do the compensation. I do not understand what does this have to do with Mustafa travel since Jet Airways is suppose to be contacting me directly !

9. I had requested at that point to receive a call back from Mr Ajmal's manager and was ignored accordingly and received another impersonal email. I understand from your email you were on ""leave"" and unable to attend to this little pesky issue.
10. Jet Airways have since contacted me on 22/07/2015, to collect the compensation at the Singapore Office
11. I did not receive any further response till today, when I called Mr Ajmal directly. I was again told that there will be a further delay as he is co-coordinating with Jet Airways and some internal processing. I was given a crash course on how the refund is suppose to be and that I should be patient.And now your email to inform me of another delay.
12. I simply DO NOT understand your processing and why I am being placed through such a hassle due to YOUR internal issues. When it came to the claim, I understand it takes a while to do a verification. However internal cheque processing is Mutafa Travels issue.
I DO NOT understand when you tell me only 1 person can process a refund and that person is on leave and you will ""TRY' to give me a refund. This is my problem.My problem is the delay and the lies being told to me. I paid for the tickets in good faith and I used the services of Mustafa Travel, a reputable travel agent. I have also done as Mr Ajmal's request with the documentation for the claim and now when its a issue of a refund, I am being given a roundabout.
If Mustafa Tavels is unable to do a refund, I should have been informed. If they was a delay I should have been informed earlier.However you guys seem to feel that I am a fool and keep pushing me around.
I am sorry however I do not understand as a General Manager, how could you send me such a impersonal email, without taking the time to clarify the issues and give me such a vague answer. If this is service, I am simply astounded by the lack of empathy, attention to details and understanding. I am totally disgusted by the attitude shown by Mr Ajmal and yourself.

,,Shopping but no bargains,1.0,,Heard a lot about this place but did not find any good bargains as a tourist. Picked up a few souvenirs and moved out. Rest of the stuff was with either of average quality or with a price tag which is available elsewhere as well (Dubai is more economical).
,,Everything You Need In One Roof,4.0,,You can shop here till you drop. The place is like a warehouse that has everything that you can think of. It is open 24/7 so you did not worry of closing time. You can shop here night time when there are less people. Great place to buy the souvenirs that you will be giving away back home. The price of most souvenirs are cheaper than anywhere else in Singapore. There are many floors and aisles and aisles of various merchandise. I've never seen a store with so many spices. It will take you sometime to browse all the aisles. Just plan your visit coz it can really get so crowded sometimes. It is a big store but the aisles were quite narrow so expect some human traffic. After shopping there are plenty of food places in the area for a bite. Plenty of Indian restaurants around.
,,mustafa centre,1.0,,"Don't bother! Expensive rubbish miserable people, makes $2 shops look good, can imaging anyone liking this place.All in all don't waste your time going there, much better places in Singapore. The area is scary!"
,,"BEST PLACE TO SPEND YOUR 24 HOURS - MUSTAFA CENTER, SINGAPORE",5.0,,"Mustafa Center is a shopping complex. You will get everything.You name it and they have it. Major plus point is, it's opn 24 x 7. Go with empty bags and full on wallet."
,,Craziness galore,3.0,,I wouldnt say this is a shopping centre more of a warehouse with many floors! Anything u can think of they will have. Can take hours to get through the many floors and aisles. Didnt find it cheap. In fact found many items more expensive than the UK.
,,A shopper's paradise,3.0,,"This was our first experience of Mustafas and we were not disappointed, a shopping sensation. You could spend hours in this shop. We ventured in around 8am and there were no crowds just serious shoppers. The luggage section has a great variety and very reasonably priced. The cafe at the end of the building has a great range for breakfast and the food was was good and cheap. If you like shopping or just browsing you will need to vist this store."
,,This is a real treat,5.0,,"This 24*7 shopping mall is one of my favorite places in Singapore. It's got almost everything you need... from groceries to electrical appliances, from sport equipment to massaging chairs... it's hard to find something that isn't there.. It is obviously crowded because of the great shopping experiences. However it makes up for it from it's very organized environment.. a must have shopping experience in Singapore."
,,Love this supermarket,5.0,,Great place to find a good selection of raw nuts and health foods...... As week as everything else you could ever imagine. I always stop here when visiting from singapore to get affordable bits and bobs. Open 24hrs so go at odd times to miss this crowds.
,,Cheap finds,4.0,,You can find everything at Mustafa Center at a cheaper price compared to other stores in Singapore. I always come back here for the perfume and souvenirs which you can ask for tax refund at the basement. There are many Indian restaurants outside which you can choose from before or after visiting Mustafa Center.
,,Bizarre,4.0,,"The Mustafa Centre is a wild ride of clothes,watches,jewellery to name but a few! I love the medicinal section and always come out with lots of oils. I was a little disappointed on my last visit as they don't stock as bigger range of Pierre Cardin shirts and underwear as they used to! that being said you hit the Centre 24/7 and the surrounding district has great Indian food."
,,There are a lot of people.,3.0,,"Devery, very crowded. Go to never forget it. After not regret it. Not cheap at the price.There are a lot of people."
,,Alladin's Cave,4.0,,"I along with my wife have shopped at Mustafa's many on at least 6 occasions over the past 10 years so we pretty well know what to expect, i.e, at times can be very crowded, goods packed to overflowing on the shelves and some of the staff with sometimes poor English. Having said all that, we really like shopping there as it is off the tourist strip and you can find just about anything under the sun especially if you are after ""Western sizes for clothes and footwear"".

There is also a good range of women's and men's perfumes and aftershaves etc. and a well stocked pharmacy. On the ground floor is a large range of name brand watches for both men and women.

Mustafa's is easy to get to from Orchard Road by SMRT - Dhoby Ghaut to Farrer Park."
,,flashback to the 70ies,3.0,,"If you want a reminder of how department stores looked 40 years ago, this is it. Goods stacked beyond reach, narrow aisles, no logical layout. A veritable Chaos of everything under one roof. But hey, there's everything under one roof and I daresay the prices also go back some years. Worth it if you love to browse."
,,Good but not Great,4.0,,If you are looking for branded stuff to cheap give away gifts this place will get you everything under one roof. Personally I didn't like much of stuff but place was crowded like crazy even at midnight. 24 hours open is probably the USP for last minute shoppers
,,24 hour shopping centre,3.0,,"In little india , nice place to shop around for pretty much anything.
Was a bit stressful with kids as it can get very crowded at times. There are a few nice local restaurants around with great verity for vegetarians. It's not the prettiest space but it does the job if you don't want to go to the city centre."
,,All in one shopping place,3.0,,"Whatever you may want to shop...right from chocolates to breads, clothes to jewellery, cosmetics to medicines and even currency exchange, its all available at the mustafa centre. located in little India, this is one nice place to spend hours and hours for shoppers. A little crowded, as may be expected for such a place, this place has something for all to look out for. Prices are competitive. It covers a large area, and is divided into zones...you may want to fix a landmark before you enter in case you wanna locate where did u get in form and where did u get out of!"
,,Open 24 hours a day,4.0,,You will always find something interesting here. Mustafa is huge and you can find almost everything you want. The beauty and bath items are usually cheaper. You can also find business shirts going for a song but you may have to do abit of digging to find your size.
,,Get all the stuff you need,4.0,,"You get all the stuff you needed this mall is huge you get fast food,daily home needs,and other things easily over here."
,,Full of Surprises,3.0,,Well i read a lot of reviews before visiting this place was really confused because of the mixed reviews. Finally convinced myself and visited the place. As soon as I reached I was surprised to know that the mall/shopping complex had several entries. Huge collection of everything and various brands for each single items which was just so amazing. The collection for perfume was awesome. I think some deals were really nice but yea its takes time to find the right match and choice. Overall a good experience but yes some of the staff was very funny like applying make up on the store and not bothered with what you are asking(but you can definitely ignore them at the cost of shopping ;)). Overall good experience!
,,Vast mustafa,5.0,,Very very huge shopping mall in the city. You can get various brands foe each single items which is impossible even in its own manufacturing country. Walking....walking....makes one tired....but it is too worthy to visit when you are in singapore
,,24 hour mart...,3.0,,"I mean this can be a wonder for a small town guy, but for people from capital of India, like me, it was a weird place.
The place is over stocked and stacks are too closely put.
They had log expired food material, o beware of what you buy.
It is just a big confusing departmental store.

Old technologies in electronic area, low quality / budget quality at apparels area.

Good thing is that it is open 24 hours."
,,Not what it used to be,2.0,,"i first visited Mustafa way back in 2007. That time it was a paradise for shoppers looking for gifts , souvenirs , chocolates to take back home. But during my 4th visit this time , the place has evolved to be a branded store/hypermarket where deals are not so good. you can get the prices being offered at any other mall/market in singapore."
,,A horrible place to shop,2.0,,"I dont understand why Mustafa center is discussed this much!!..Its like a typical warehouse with hell lot of things dumped in a cluttered fashion!!..Ofcourse there are really 'cheap' items available here...but not worth straining yourself..The streat / place around is extreamly oppressive!!..This would be probably the only unclean place in Singapore!
Next time a strong no no to this place.!!"
,,Depends on your point of view,4.0,,"For me there were requests from home to pick up stuff you don't get easily there. So while transiting through Singapore, I stopped over at Mustafa. The fact is that the store has almost everything that you will need. The best part is that most sections are open 24x7.
But a trifle disorganised though and 2 out 5 (I counted) salespersons will not where a particular item is located. So if you are looking for cinnamon powder in the row and the rack where all other spices are kept you may not find it. Instead while walking through the pulses rack you will come across the powdered spice (of the same brand of the other spices). But in my experience patience and a watchful eye pays."
,,Mustafa Centre,5.0,,"Excellent variety of jewellery, electronics, food, dress material, etc tempt u to buy beyond ur budget"
,,A place to buy all sorts of things,4.0,,"The complex is very big. You'd think you have reach the end, only to find yourself entering another area. It's easy to find things for a cheaper price, even electronics. Best thing is it's open for 24 hours! A must go every time I visit Singapore."
,,Avoid weekend and after 6 p.m. on weekdays,4.0,,"I like to go to this place for groceries shopping. It's a great deal for import lamb and mutton. The quality is good for those 2 kind of meat. Also a lot of choices for import sauce from USA ie Hot sauce and etc. The price for clothes is not cheaper than other stores in Singapore. The price that also compatible is chocolates, perfumes and souvenirs. A few times I made a mistake by went there on weekends or after 6 p.m on weekdays and it was a nightmare. It's too crowded and staffs always grumpy coz none stop of work specialty cashiers."
,,Place to buy all kind of chocolates,4.0,,"Place that has everything that we'd like to buy for ""oleh-oleh"". From imported snacks, candies and chocolates. And also parfumes."
,,Rude Staff,1.0,,Been to this place multiple times.. This can be one of the biggest shopping center in Asia but it's totally going in a wrong way because of it's own sales staff... This was the first place where you can see the staff hiding behind the racks .. they don't help on any queries... on top of it they pass very rude/racial remarks on customers... Hopefully the management will do some change before it's too late.
,,Shopping& Eating& Shopping,5.0,,"Like to shop? This is the place where you can get anything and everything gold jewelry, clothes,shoes,handbags electronics, etc. You name it, you will get it. Oh! tired of shopping wanna give you feet little rest and feed you empty stomach,hmmm. What kind of food you like? All restaurants are well maintained with cleanliness and serve good and freshly made food."
,,Clumsy and Cluttered,2.0,,The Mustafa Center was chaotic. Though the mall is huge in size it is very difficult to find things there. The display is poor and does not provide you a good shopping experience. The shoes in the shoe section had the pairs piled up tastelessly and appeared more like a store room. Moreover the stuff available was cheap and the quality was also not quite up to the mark. You can visit it one time to have a first-hand experience but are likely never to go for a second visit if you are finicky about good in-shop experience. The executives I met there were not very friendly and they merely pointed in a certain direction when asked about something.
,,Try not to get lost!!!,4.0,,"This place is HUGE!! We visited this place in the middle of the night because we had jet lag. There were not too many people, but still people shopping in there. Just when you think, you come to a dead end, no, another turn, you are in a different department. They do everything you can think of, and things you never knew it existed. Crazy mega store!!"
,,24 hours shop,3.0,,Very big market with lot of products and so many varieties can shop anything at one stop but very difficult to find the things & all self service
,,A Place to Buy Merchandise and Oleh Oleh!,3.0,,"Lot of cheap snacks, merchandise, chocolates, and many more. If you are going to Singapore and trying to find some ""oleh-oleh"" then Mustafa if a place you must visit! The price here was so affordable compare to another shopping malls.

Not only for snacks or merchandise, even for toiletries, bath and body stuffs also affordable here. It was super crowded, so better be here at night? Around 7ish."
,,"Cheap shopping, but crowded",3.0,,"Mustafa center is crowded, it is not a shopping center again, but become a supermarket. Very narrow. Not good for shopping. Mustafa now is very big, two building. The price is cheap. You can buy chocolate here. Complete. If you want to go here, by MRT, go to the. Farrer park. Walk 200m. In front of Mustafa center, there is a Serangoon plasa, chocolate is also here."
,,24 hour shopping where you can buy 'almost' everything!,4.0,,"This is a 24 hour shopping where you can buy 'almost' everything!

Located at Little India, this mall is spread out over several floors. They have a supermarket, jewelry section, watch section, toiletries section, electronics section... The list goes on.

With the wide variety of merchandise, you can find something that you want or might want.

They were one of the first store in Singapore to open 24 hours and there are people who do visit at wee hours of the morning to do their shopping.

Good for insomniacs who prefer to do a spot of shopping instead of counting sheep in the middle of the night!"
,,Rather not,1.0,,"I have been to Mustafas many times dragged there by co travellers, again this week. Same terrible experience as before, sure the shelves are overflowing with stuff to buy, but all the staff are always sullen and unhelpful,signage is terrible. Ok if you know what you want and where it is. No cheaper than anywhere else. Note to self.... Don't go back."
,,A ginormous Aladdins cave open 24 hours,4.0,,"What a place - I have not seen a hyper market this big. 1 floor of just pharmaceuticals, 1 floor all 24 carat jewellery, 1 floor of fresh meat poultry fish fruit anf veg, 1 floor kitchen utensils, 1 floor mens clothing and the list goes on. There are 3 money changing kiosks too. Please be careful with the money changers. On one ocassion we changed £100 and were given Singapore dollars worth £50.00 - after complaining, the teller gave to me the correct money without question no apology - they seem to be very rude. Bought pistachio nuts [from the USA] fresh milk for our tea and coffee in our room at the hotel [since we do not like the coffee mate]. A lot of variety of fresh milk mainly from Australia some local brands too. Lots of people shopping especially on a Sunday evening. There is an Indian buffet restaurant on the top floor."
,,Lots of stuff in a relatively small space,4.0,,"The array of items and sheer number of items is impressive. The prices are reasonable. Some items are on sale, some looked like they were on permanent sale (mark up, mark down, old signs). Sales staff was helpful. There is organization to the floor plan, but you still may need to ask for help."
,,Mega Store,3.0,,"This is the maga store, located in Little India area of Singapore. It is usually very crowded. Mostly, all household items are available here at reasonable prices."
,,Cheap shopping 24/7,4.0,,"Mustafa's is not a place if you are looking for designer labels . This is authentic Singapore . I suggest going downstairs and rummaging though the the hundreds of scarves and shawls in silk and other materials . Go upstairs for souvenirs and Indian food . Electronic goods , costume jewellery , gold, watches , clothes are typical of the country . If rummaging is not your thing don't go . Perfume and toiletries include products from India, China , Japan , Malaysia , Korea and the Uk .."
,,You can get lost here,4.0,,"Wow! This place is huge and I actually lost my hubby here. This place has several entrances and several buildings are interconnected. Hubby was at one entrance waiting for me and after shopping, I couldn't find which entrance he was at. Nobody could help me and I had the only cell phone between the 2 of us. Finally I told the security guard which MRT station I came from and the steps I took to get to the entrance. Found him after an hour of searching. Anyway, they have a great 22k gold jewelry section at good prices. You can find almost everything here- clothes ( not trendy ones) sandals, batik, housewares, food, etc. but IMHO the gold jewelry section is worth going to take a look."
,,Not worth a visit for Indian Tourists,3.0,,"For an Indian, its just an extension of Indian market place in Singapore. You will find exactly similar ambience, similar stuff and not something new.

The sheer size of this place makes it worth visiting once and you can be rest assured that you will not be able to come out from the way you went in. :)"
,,All in One Roof,5.0,,"All in one roof.. you name it they have it.. its open 24hrs.. its near little india, Lavender station."
,,money exchange,4.0,,"its a mall nothing extraordinary worth a visit, everything is there money exchange was the best as they offer some good rates, its good for the locals to buy some house old things, its a 3 building all to gather, the perfumes are cheep."
,,Ok,2.0,,"Too many indians there, a good place to get money changed over at midnight as all the other money changers are closed"
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"Be careful. I wanted to buy a watch from the Mustafa Centre and when the attendant was getting it out of the box she dropped it. I asked for a new one and she said she would get me another while I went to the cashier to pay. My wife was watching and saw the same watch go into the bag to give to me. When I queried it, the attendant refused to accept that she had dropped it. The Supervisor also refused to do anything about it. As I had already paid for it, I could do nothing about it. I was also not given appropriate paperwork to claim the travellers tax refund even though I asked. Mostly an OK place to shop but I question their ethics if something goes wrong. Buyer beware!"
,,Everything and anything!,4.0,,"Phew.. virtually everything you can get in this huge complex, only minus is it's hard to get the attention of a staff as everyone is so busy and too big always very crowded but yes you get what you want, needs to be more informative and arranged, it's like a must visit place and for sure who ever wish to buy gold or test the perfumes for free! sometimes tiring to find the right things needed, can be visited again and again!"
,,Good stuff,4.0,,"My family was at the store in May, my kids loved their chocolate selection which I noticed was less than the duty free. They also bought so many biscuits and other knick knacks which were very reasonable. There were 2 or 3 money changers close to the store who gave us a good exchange rate.
The store has evrything in it, very popular store in singapore.
You name it they have it !!
A must visit if you are in Singapore!"
,,The Great Indian Shopholics,3.0,,"You are an Indian; you go to Singapore on a pleasure trip and you fail to visit the Mustafa Center – It’s unbelievable. Visit to Mustafa Center in Singapore for an Indian is like a Pilgrimage. It is said that this massive and huge shopping center spread across numerous building and thousands of acres stocks the cheapest and the best of the products.

However I begged to differ when I visited the same. Agreed the stuffs are cheap but you need to compromise on quality. It is also a bargainer’s paradise and you need to really play your cards well to strike a bargain. If shopping is on your cards then do visit the store however I personally believe I got a better deal from Changi than at Mustafa."
,,Almost everything you need for a home,5.0,,Almost everything for a home for a business for starionary for a hotel or even for lunch/dinner. This place is the shopper's ecstasty. Its a 24hrs shopping mall/plaza/supermarket. You can call it whatever.
,,'Final boss' dungeon of a building.,3.0,,"Pluses : you can probably get everything you want to buy in Singapore here. Goods are cheaper than you can find elsewhere.
Minuses : you have to FIND it in this hodge-podge maze of a building.

Mustafa Centre is a great concept, however, the arrangement of goods leaves a lot to be desired. Everything is just placed around in general groupings leaving you to search for the things you want to buy. Sometimes those groupings even repeat - I've found at least three pharmaceutical 'sections' in completely different parts of the building.

In addition to that, the building is a mix of several shops that are not fully connected - leaving to mind those 'final boss' RPG dungeons where you have only one path to tread through and if you want to get back to an earlier section, the easiest way will be to exit the building and re-trace your steps."
,,Not recommended.....,1.0,,"Went here cause recommend by the hotel staff. Was bad, was true that they have little bit of everything, you name it they have it.

But the environment wasn't very good, people are rude, they wont even look at you when you talk to them, just wasted of time, really not recommended for shopping. Just dont go here for shopping...."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"I have been to this place twice till now and I believe that if you dont visit this place, your shopping is not complete. Its one of the oldest shopping mall in Little India and has all sort of items. I always gets lost in the mall, enters from one side and comes out from diff sides always. You will find all sort of house hold items to costly electronics and gold jewelry sections here."
,,It's got everything,5.0,,"I dont ever really review shopping malls but this one is all kinds of fantastic. We came here at 12 at night cos my friend needed a new phone and the place was popping. I dont know if it was because thats Singapore culture, or cos theres nothing else to do at 12 at night. Like, even the trains stopped working. Coupled with that this place has literally everything you could want, think of all the variety of a supermall + grocery store + electronics shop + drugstore all packed into one convenient space. I know I'll be back when I want 12am cell phones."
,,Very convenient shopping centre under one roof,4.0,,"Very convenient for shopping since it is open 24 x 7, close to the MRT. Chocolates, travel bags are quite reasonable. One can get anything and everything at Mustafa.
Cabs are not easy to get late evenings Visit Singapore by day and shop at Mustafa by night. A must visit when in Singapore"
,,An everything from 22K or 24K Gold to Food kind of place!,5.0,,"If you ever visit Singapore please do visit Mustafa center at least once. It is in Little India. We went at the end of 2013 but could not add that info on this site. But Mustafa center is still the same as many of my friends have visited it too since then. You may need more than one or at least have a full day to check it out! It sells everything at reasonable prices (all set prices no bargaining) and is made up of about 4-5 blocks and is very crowded. The center also crosses several streets and has different things in different buildings. Watches are sold in one place, gold in another building, perfumes and other goods in another building. Avoid weekends if you can. Go early in the day for less crowds and good service. They have VAT forms and they will fill it out for you so you can claim back at the Changi Airport before leaving. They have an area where they do that for you. The service personnel are nice but very busy. So best to go earlier in the day when they first open and also go during week days if you can. There is a wonderful restaurant called Kebabs and Curries at the top of one of the buildings with fountains, outside patio (if you wish), etc for a nice meal. They have buffet in the evenings that is rather expensive about $40 ringgit per person but has everything. Happy shopping, eating and enjoying!"
,,An incredible store that has a truly amazing range of items,5.0,,"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Trying to describe the Mustafa Centre in any other way is difficult. While the centre is the size of a very large department store that is tightly packed from floor to ceiling with goods; it is part supermarket with a large fresh food section including a street cafe / in store bakery, part cheap tourist store at least comparable to what you'd find in Singapore's China Town, part specialist Asian and Indian foods store, part clothing store and more. I was amazed by the range of items on offer - there is something here from most parts of the world to interest everyone. Allow plenty of time in your itinerary if you want to trawl the depths of the centre. Prices in some sections are very reasonable. I particularly enjoyed the onsite bakery section on level 2 where I purchased my lunch. There were several tasty varieties of samosas, large pizza slices (all priced $2 or less) and delectable cake slices (under $3). You will not need to worry about closing time as the shop trades 24 hours a day and offers tourists the usual tourists rebates for duty free shopping. Located in the the Little India area the shop is accessible from two MRT stations, several buses or taxi. Wheel chair access maybe difficult but lifts and ramps are available."
,,Shop at anytime,4.0,,There is not a thing you can't find at Mustafa. Love the perfume collection and make up selection. Loved the shoping experience
,,24 X7 SHOPPING,4.0,,"Work the whole day and shop in the night....Best place to shop for people who cannot spare time to visit the gigantic malls and other shopping areas of Singapore during normal hours.Only sad part is they do not have enough support staff to guide you to the location where the stuff is which you need to buy, and you have to fend for yourselves to locate it."
,,Indian shopping area,4.0,,A huge hyper market mainly where all Indian tourists go. Good place to buy chocklates clothing and daily essentials. Very cheap but certain items are priced high than the market. So buy after having a idea on its price. A 24 hour shopping mall with money exchange.
,,Everything! 24 hours,5.0,,"I was looking for a mouse and stumbled onto a mechanical keyboard that I wasn't even looking for. Of course, I bought it. If you are looking to do a little shopping for random things, check out these place."
,,48 hours to shop non stop,5.0,,"One stop shop for all your shopping needs. Clothes are not so great but food, chocolates, perfumes, watches. excellent variety. Got a mount blanc pen for 20% cheaper and yes was original so no issues with quality on branded stuff."
,,Shopper's paradise,4.0,,"It is a 24 hour shopping mall very popular with expatriate Indians, Bangladeshis & Malaysians in Singapore"
,,Everything from a toothpick to a tent ...,5.0,,"This unbelievably huge and wonderful centre in Little India is a great way to spend a couple of hours - buying good stuff you didn't know existed. We went by taxi and were dropped off at Door 1 (which I didn't remember until later). I was looking for a little card for my camera. I chose it and received a receipt which I then had to take to a cashier, return with my stamped receipt to collect my card. But, no. I picked up a basket and started to wander. Up the escalators - there are 4 floors, spread over I don't know how many buildings. No wonder it's open 24 hours a day. On one floor, I bought a great convex rear vision mirror for my car - no more blind spots. One huge floor is just Indian food. Upstairs a big supermarket with food from all over the world - and not at all expensive. And if you like chocolate - this is the place. We were getting hungry and stepped out onto the pavement (I think it was Door 3 or 4), but had no idea where we were and I had to find my camera card! It took me half a hour to find Door 1, collect my card and then work out where I had left my friends."
,,Really just another mall,3.0,,This is a 24 hour mall in little India north of the CBD. Aside from the hours and location it's really just another mall. We did find a few quirky items however don't expect great prices.
,,Poor quality,1.0,,"The shop is so crowded that there was hardly any room to walk. Merchandise is stacked so closely that the aisles are so small to maneuver. I felt that the merchandise is stacked up so much that the store might sink. It seems like a hazardous place. If there should be an emergency like a fire, it would be difficult to get out of the store without someone being injured. Signage is also poor. Many interesting items to look at yet they are not of good quality and not cheap. Cashier lines are disorganized and difficult to find floor employees to assist. Once is enough for the experience. I would not recommend this place. If you are looking for Indian spices, Little India might be better."
,,crazy crazy 24 hr place,5.0,,"u name it and it is most likely avalible here!!! open 24 hrs for everything grocery, perfume, cosmetics, chocolates etc etc. Its huge, you can easily get lost..cosmetics and perfumes are cheapest here."
,,All kinds of everything,4.0,,"As my title said, you can find all kinds of everything here. I mainly visit for their Colognes, creams and so on. It is a must-visit for sure and while i wont say that 100% of their stuff is authentic it is still a good place to shop.
I'm sure their perfumes are genuine - it is too big an organisation to be selling imitations, but you might find one or two things that are iffy. The crowd my be off - putting but that is easily solved by getting there early or late in the day - open 24 hours!!!
So one shouldn't miss mustafa's when in Singapore."
,,Good price market !,5.0,,"Located near MRT station (Little India, just 5 minutes by foot), cheap price compare than other center markets. Also available exchange money."
,,"day and night, especially when you can't sleep",3.0,,"This is incredible, a 24 hour shopping center that is always packed with people. It's not glamorous or anything, just huge and you can generally find anything under this roof from food, electronics, jewels all the way to medicine. I used to come here when I couldn't sleep at night just to stroll around during my college days."
,,Great place to shop for in Singapore,5.0,,The place is right in the heart of little India. Open 24x7 for shoppers. You can get anything and everything under one roof. Its generally very crowded so please make sure you have enough time in hand.
,,Anytime store,4.0,,"A 24 hour HuGe store for anything you want. A lannmark for little india, this place is just awesome. Been there at 11 in the night as it was not far frm our hotel and find it as lively as day."
,,Over hyped,3.0,,"I had heard a lot about this place and had great expectations. But it didn't meet my expectations. Though everything is available here, it's just like any other mall . Neither is it very cheap nor very good quality."
,,Great Bargain Shopping,4.0,,"The closest MRT station is Farrer Park The store is a bargain outlet for most everything you could want. There is a large selection of watches, men's clothing and electronics. I bought 2 Pierre Cardin short sleeved shirts for $29 each."
,,All in one place for everything!,4.0,,"I visited Singapore a few years back (not in May 2014, chose that option from drop down since that was the oldest available) with my parents, we heard a lot about the 24 hour shopping center - Mustafa .. My mom loved it since its a great place to shop and window-shop a variety of things like house hold appliances, jewelry, grocery, electronic gadgets, clothes, fashion accessories etc and the prices were not that high. But the place is usually crowded and could be overwhelming to people not used to crowds. It is a good place to go when you have a lay-over in Singapore because it is open everyday and is closer to Farrer MTR metro station. It is located in a place called little india which has many restaurants- we went to Banana leaf which had tasty indian food."
,,you get everything under the sun !,4.0,,its a 24 hour store and you literrally get everything under the sun here. from food to electronics to everything ! would not reccommend this place if you dont need to buy anything
,,Almost Everything. . .,3.0,,"I read a lot about the place and decided to give it a go. It is crowded, noisy, busy. . . as advertised. I picked up some unique snacks and did some browsing, but couldn't find any beer, hence the title. If you are looking for ANYTHING ELSE and you like crowds and confusion, look no further. Want alcohol? Look elsewhere."
,,Good shopping place,5.0,,You can find any thing you want here. there're many stuff over here. I bought G-Shock watch for my nephew and bought chocolate.
,,Amazing place with amazing varieties & choices..,4.0,,"This place is highly popular with locals, tourists & foreigners staying in Singapore. Its a huge departmental store with a big supermarket to match.

Prices here are generally cheaper than elsewhere but not for 100% products though.

But the most amazing & unique thing about MUSTAFA centre is the really huge varieties & choices of so many products especially the supermarket. Many of which cannot be found in other supermarkets here.

Whether it is chocolates, electrical appliances, cooking ingredients, etc - the range & choices are so wide, so interesting too.

This is a must come place. Probably need to spend a couple of hours if you want to see everything here.

Highly recommended."
,,Great Singapore Shopping,4.0,,"Huge department store selling just about anything you could possibly imagine for excellent prices. Love the shoe department, great quality leather shoes for under $20 Aus - I stock up on every visit! You could spend the day there and still not see everything."
,,Buy Chocolates not Biscuits,4.0,,"Chocolates are comparatively cheaper than the dutyfree. So buy them. Best thing about this is its 24hours open, so you can shop till dawn. Bags and food are also cheaper than other locations. Must visit location."
,,Great bargain!,4.0,,Bought perfumes here during my visit.. Very near to Parkroyal on Kitchener road where I stayed. Most important is it is open 24hrs!
,,One stop Shopping Mall in Singapore 24/7,5.0,,"It's located on Syed Alwi Road, Walking distance from Ferrer Park station. This shopping centre provide 24/7 with wide varieties of products, including Foods, household appliances, watches, electronic goods, clothing, footwear, jewelry etc. money changer service is there with good rates and restaurants also available inside the shopping mall. I would like to suggest one thing, system of cashier is not good. They need to improve that. Apart of it, that place is the best place for shopping for urself or for ur family n friends."
,,Under One Roof,5.0,,"You could literally get everything here in this 24 hours shopping mall. It is huge stretching from the junction of Serangoon Road and Syed Alwi Road to almost Jalan Besar and Syed Alwi Road on the other side. When you are in Singapore ask any locals or even foreigners about Mustafas and they will be able to direct you. It is near to Farrer Park MRT, bus stop and taxi from the airport to here cost about US$15. You can buy branded watches, beauty products, perfumes, supermarket, electronics, computers, GOLD, anything and almost everything. A must for all. There is also ample parking place and also a good dining restaurant of 7th level."
,,Cool/Cheap/International Brands,4.0,,"If you're looking for brands you'll know at a half decent price then try here.

I went on a Thursday lunch time and wasn't busy at all. Some what chaotic in its lay out and I found the ladies sections lacking compared to vast sections for men. Huge jewellery section though and if you wear a bra 34A or above you're in luck ;)

Some interesting places along the way too from MRT too :)"
,,Must for shopoholics!,3.0,,"yes pin to plane would be the right word. All time open,this market sees no night, every thing at jaw dropping prices, you are sure to loot the place. You reach at any time and you wouldnt get tired shopping."
,,four stars only for the variety,4.0,,its a must see place that how its built how vast it is and the variety they have otherwise i did not personally liked the area
,,Busy Shopping Centre,4.0,,Visited this place a few times once for money change as I think it's the best place to foreign currency exchange.Also the perfumes and cologne are cheap . it's always busy so to me best time is late morning or late night as they are open 24 hours.
,,Better spend your precious shopping time elsewhere,2.0,,"Somehow, I expected Mustafa centre to be similar to the one's in China or Korea, where you can really find some good bargains. Well that's not the case with Mustafa. Finding a certain product in this huge maze of piled stuff is too difficult and if you manage to eventually find it, it's likely that the price will be exactly the same as anywhere else. Visit only if curious about the place itself or shopping at wee hours. Hunting real bargains here is a waste of time."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"When on a Sunday, it was very crowded, anything you can think of i am sure you would be able to find it, remember where you came it as you can easier get lost in this place and exit in the wrong place."
,,Great value buys,4.0,,"Was in Singapore over the weekend and went down to Little India to get some Indian food for a late dinner. Good was good and noticed many people heading into a shopping complex called Mustafa. This was at 11pm so decided what the fuss was all about. Shocked to find almost every everything on their counters and I mean almost everything. The only item I didnt see was a toilet bowl. I reckon if I walked around more even that would have been on display. What amazed me was the sale they had on perfumes which was even cheaper than some of the perfumes I had purchased while in London. Seriously they have everything. We walked around and ended up buying bags of stuff. We eventually left at 3am Yes 3am. The place is open 24hrs. The only reason we left was cause we had too much stuff to carry back. Hahahahahaha
Loads of restaurants outside serving local Indian foods. Now I know why they say Singapore has it all. And the safety is second to none. I have never felt safer anywhere else in the world than in Singapore.
I will definitely be going back there to shop. This time with stronger buddies to help me carry back the bag fulls of stuff I intend to buy."
,,24,5.0,,"You cannot say anything bad about a place that is open 24 hours a day and has almost everything you want to buy. The selection on this place is amazing. The prices are fair, but for tourists, you can refund GST right there in the place before you leave so that's added discount right there. Great low end shopping!"
,,Good for a breath of cold air,4.0,,The AC in the Mustafa centre was amazing after an extremely humid walk around little India. Prices are a little high for what I expected for things like sunscreen.
,,Why not ... shop in the wee hours,4.0,,"It sounds very kitch, and it is at least quirky ... but fun. Browse through four very long floors of just about anything you can think of, at a time of day when you can't really be doing anything else (open 24 hours). After a general evening browse I went back before breakfast the next day to grab a new camera bag to fit my newer lenses as well as a sling strap, both at pretty good prices ... and should have spent more time looking at sports shoes and clothing."
,,Shopping Galore,4.0,,"Best place to shop in Expensive Singapore they literally have everything from food and drink to cosmetics,electronics,clothing,sweets,toys and a whole load more at best prices in Singapore plus it's open 24hrs. I would recommend going late evening or night as its less busy.Because it can get really busy during the days and with the narrow alleys can become a bit of a tussle.Better to go when the crowds have gone and enjoy at your own leisure.Plus great places close by to eat also."
,,Awesome day shopping,5.0,,This place is amazing its huge and has everything imaginable for sale. All at a very good price. The grocery part is fabulous just to see the variety of foods and the clothing has all sorts there's electronics pharmaceutical everything in this one store!! Outstanding
,,Massive palace of low end shopping!,3.0,,"This is a massive structure, surrounded by restaurants, with all manner of Halal food and electronics. No products from Jewish suppliers or Israel, no pork or alcohol (already implied above) and incompetent staff.

However, prices are reasonably low and for those that know what they want and that involves obscure product ranges from the Indian subcontinent. Dig in.

For Western BDS types and other multicultis this should be your Nirvana!"
,,Open 24 Hours,5.0,,"Great place to shop when ever feel the urge. This place has everything from jewelry, electronics, shoes, clothes, food and its just goes on and on. A nice way to spend a few hours :)"
,,Shopping spree,4.0,,The most affordable mall in Singapore. You can find almost everything here. Good for the tourist as the mall offers an option for the shopper to reimburse the GST when one leaves Singapore. Do read the fine print on the web.
,,Nice Place to enjoy Shopping...!!!,5.0,,This place we went for shopping and we bought many things for our family and we spent long time over there and enjoyed lot...
,,"A very big mall, kind of kiosk and money change.",4.0,,"A very big privet mall in Little India region with very comfortable prices. In this 3 or 4 floor mall you can find every thing you may need: food, cosmetics, electric products, clothing, watches , outdoor items , cases and suitcases while every category have many varietions.
In addition they have a change mony service with very attractive rates and even small restaurant. Worth at least a visit."
,,Mustafa center,3.0,,"I did not find this place appealing. Yes it may have everything but the place is crammed and needs a very patient human to shop.

The only positive was that I found lots of south indian eateries around, esp Sarvana Bhavan .I visited this last in 2008 in Canada so it was a pleasant surprise."
,,Mustafa Centre,4.0,,Very good place to visit. Though crowded during weekends it is the one place shop for everything you are looking out to buy.
,,Mustafa Center - You get everything,5.0,,"Mustafa Mall center is one of the singapore's icon - Most of the sections are open 24/7 (Except jewels shop) - You get everything here right from electronics / food items / toys / Eatables / bags/ Make up items etc

It is one of the biggest shop in Singapore with too much of people pouring in from all gates
Visited multiple time during my stay - Good discounts also - Dont miss this shop if you are looking for everything under one roof - Tourists favorite shop"
,,Sea of electronics and humanity,3.0,,"Positives: You will find everything related to electronics there. And I mean everything.

But you will have to contend with crowding and disorganized aisles everywhere inside.

I didn't find prices any cheaper than high-street.

Been there a few times in the past but I don't go there anymore.

Sim Lim square is the same and more accessible.

The only positive is that it is open almost 24 hours so that you can go there at any time you want."
,,Buy anytime...anything...if you can find it,4.0,,"Well this place was a life saver for me as I went to Singapore during the Chinese new year and everything was closed apart from this mega mall type store. Not only that it's 24/7....so suits me even more. I usually go around the hotel when I first check in just to check the surrounding and there was nothing there apart from this place. Also there are tons of restaurants/eatery around it where you can go to get some food when you need to refuel....mostly seem to be South East Asian range.

Anyway the store is huge, has multi levels but seems they packed in as much as they could in the given space...which somewhat kills the shopping experience as often you run into people or they to you or have to give way in tight spaces in every turn. Not only that some goods are like just piled up than one would expect them to be properly placed and displayed...they don't have no idea about window dressing...guess they don't need it. Tons of brands though from very cheap to pretty expensive...all stashed in somewhere around the store.

There were some colorful and questionable characters(shoppers not store clerks) are around which made me check for my wallet few times. Overall it was alright...all products are genuine even though at first glance I thought they were replicas or fakes.....but found out in Singapore you are not allowed to sell such and a store clerk assured me they don't.

Go here if you suddenly figured out you didn't do that much shopping around 2 in the morning...there are plenty of lights, people and taxis....plus it's Singapore...you're always safe."
,,Something you dont find in every country,4.0,,It's one of its kind shopping center where you can find each and everything. Under one roof buy everything and it's 24 hours open. Where else do you get to buy electronics or your favorite gadgets 24 hours of a day ?
,,Dodgy place you can get anything you need,3.0,,"Mustafa Centre is super dingy, but it is also massive. Pretty much anything you want you could find here and it's conveniently open 24hrs."
,,Find and explore everything you need,4.0,,"Mustafa center is a complete whole sale I ever seen. With cheap price but good qualities product. Unfortunately it was very messy place. Takes time to explore and find what we need. But it's 24 hour market, so... nothing can stop you for shopping in there!"
,,Mediocre,2.0,,"Before visiting SG, one of the reasons why we choose Little India as our place of stay was because of this 24 hour multi-story department store that we read about. We thought it will be a very happening and happy place to be in. But it was a rather gloomy, shabby market with much of the commodities being cheap and low-grade. And not very clean too. But on the flip side, one could find everything and anything under the sun in this humongous store."
,,Ordinar wholesale market,3.0,,In same block of buildings in Little India in Singapore is located a few same shops. I visited 4 of them. Employees are not trained to understand articles that they are selling so on all questions answers was disaster. Prices are simmilar like in other places in expensive city. For some articles choices are below expectations.
,,A bit messy,3.0,,"It opens 24 hrs .Then if nowhere to go, not a bad idea. There are many things in the store. Too many to choose from. Not cheapest it could be. Some shops on Orchard Rd are cheaper."
,,An experience,4.0,,"Do not go on a Sunday. Sunday is the migrant workers day off. Many migrant workers come from the Sub Continent and Little India is packed. The Mustafa Centre is busy every day but Sunday is Chaos. This shop? Store? vast building sells everything from everywhere. The aisles are narrow, the layout confusing but its great I love it. Visit the gold/ jewellery section. The craftsmanship is superb on the ornate gold jewellery. The price on the item is the craftsperson's price then add the current gold price for the item's weight for the total cost."
,,Everything under one roof - great value,5.0,,I have at least one trip to Mustafa centre whenever I am in Singapore. Shop stocks everything that might want at discounted prices. Plan to spend several hours here. Tax free shopping for tourists.
,,Guilty Pleasure!,4.0,,"I have visited this shopping centre several times already but I should say that it's always good to be back and check out their vast stock.
I'm from Jakarta and I consider this as a guilty pleasure.
I might as well be reviewing this place anyway :)

Mustafa Centre is indeed original and made for locals. They have everything from watches to bicycles, perfumes to vitamins, a great one stop shopping (that is 24 hours!) if you're looking for things that are cheaper than anywhere else in Singapore, even if you are a tourist.
I myself enjoy the supermarket section, the drugstore and the ladies' soap, shampoo and sorts. It is totally not a grand experience since they have small alleys, the place does smell and there are lots of locals, but it's worth it when I find many things that we don't have in Jakarta.

There are also many Indian food stalls/restaurant around the place and most of them are good!"
,,EVERTHING in one place,5.0,,"this is a repeat trip for me -everytime I go to Singapore, I look for best prices and choices here. the staff are friendly, they know what they are selling and can easily tell you if the brand is available or not...including what items of the brand are still available. they will also show you where to get the items in the large shopping center...

you can get everything here ( supermarket, hypermarket, jewellery, electronics..plus many other stuff) .a normal shopping trip may be about an hour or more...unless you have a long list for the whole family."
,,It's hard leaving this place,4.0,,"I find the area of Little India in Singapore fascinating. It's never changed in 40 years we've been visiting. One night, late, we felt like going shopping but everything was closed except Mustafas, so off we went. It is just mesmerising - there is 'stuff' everywhere on all floors. It must have been midnight, not too crowded, and we spent hours walking around. I bought a GUESS watch - same one I saw at Sydney airport for half the price. Then upstairs and got our son an amazing range of new clothes for his birthday and I mean great brands. The only backflip I found was that there was so much merchandise it was difficult to pull out a top and then try to put it back. This place, though, has EVERYTHING, so if you can't sleep at 2am, grab a cab and go to Mustafas. It's so worth the visit."
,,"Ok, that is for local",3.0,,"We are from Europe, so we felt little bit lost in there :) The shoping style at Mustafa Center is Everything, Everywhere, Anytime! Lot of people shoping, sitting, talking. They are open 24 hours. For us it was wild, bussy, confusing and dirty."
,,Perfume is cheap,5.0,,All I can say perfume is cheap and chocolates too! Name it everything is in the mall. I bought a lot of perfume because I can't get it in my country! Have fun shopaholic...

,,Shoppers heaven! From toothpaste to freezers!,5.0,,"Set at the top border of Little India this amazing store which first opened in the 1970s selling clothing to the population of Little India is now expanded to be so much more than just a department store.

We have visited here many times and each time its as amazing as the first!

They have a full floor dedicated to gold jewellery - I have never seen so much gold in one place!

And it's a similar story for every item of clothing, food stuff, tool, appliance etc. etc..

This place never ceases to amaze!"
,,Great Shopping experience,5.0,,"Once in a lifetime experience. Best place to buy mementos and gifts for your family and friends when coming back from Singapore. I bought few watches, gifts and toys for my family and relatives. The prices are really best and things are trendy. I felt I needed few more hours to shop and experience at Mustafa. Next time with family sure."
,,Good place for Shopping,3.0,,"Its quite big & lot of stuff is available here. Electronic goods, mobiles,Household goods, cosmetics, Food items, Furniture Clothes etc. There are money changers located nearby that can help you to get change currency. There are quite a few restaurants also nearby."
,,Set back in time,5.0,,"When I visited Musafa yesterday to get myself a new briefcase, I always tell myself that Mustafa hasn't changed for the past 10 years. In the old building, that is. Yes, there are minor changes and renovations but it still looks the same and has the same feel. Mustafa sells everything cheap from jeans to underwear to exotic jams and juices and chocolates for tourists. It sells DSLRs and ironing boards, not to mention shoes and trampolines. It sells EVERYTHING( if it is not out of stock ). But please do not comment on their customer service level. Mustafa is not a tourist attraction. It is just famous among tourists for having everything. So don't expect 5* service from cashiers and assistants although there are a few helpful ones."
,,Very good bargains,5.0,,"I find this place the best for shopping. You get everything that you need here. If you look carefully, you might find something that's a real good bargain. It's very famous among the Indian shoppers and sometimes it gets very crowded. You have a foreign currency exchange on the premises and an Indian cuisine restaurant on the top floor (a little pricey for average food)."
,,What a shop!,4.0,,"Definitely worth visiting on your trip to Singapore. Located in Little India, Mustafa's is open 24/7. It has everything you could possible imagine for sale in there. Look around as there are some good bargains to be found!"
,,cheap shopping in singapore,4.0,,the shop is really huge and stuffed to the brim.you name anything and you get it.you need not go anywhere else for your shopping.rates are also very reasonable.
,,Great stuff available,4.0,,Indeed a great shopping centre and almost everything human kind required is available :-)....need two full days to see the entire complex....for middle and above average shoppers !!! Go for it !!
,,Don't worry it's Mustafa !,4.0,,"It's in Little India. A favourite Singaporean shopping experience for every Indian , and all over the world. Ideally located. Accessible from more than one road.Always with a bustling crowd. All under one roof at best price seems to have made it a cult attraction. My wife was happy with the Home furnishing area. I had some electronic accessories. Good bargain from a wide range at reasonable price makes Mustafa different. Got travellers tax refund also. Late night shopping facility adds convenience. Don't miss to have a tea on the busy roadside."
,,Practically everything you want,3.0,,"Convenient to MRT. Security uses plastic ties to secure your bags (anti-theft measure) before entry. It's a bit overwhelming but I did most of my gift shopping here for folks back home. There was a very helpful amazing woman in the health section. Not all clerks were friendly. In the sari section, one woman didn't offer help or acknowledge me. Instead, she talked on her cell phone. When I asked to see something, she had a bad attitude. When I told her I wanted to buy 10 of the same scarves, she got serious (I had to tell her several times that I wasn't joking) but in the end, she didn't have it and she went back to having the same bad attitude. I thought about complaining, but had the feeling I wouldn't be able to track a manager. Skip the top floor buffet. Expensive for bad Indian food. You can do better outside the premises."
,,Always an adventure,5.0,,I liked that you can find everything here 24/7at reasonable prices. Great for your souvenir shopping as you can find some unusual goods. Grocery shop at the same time for stuff you might want to snack on in your hotel room later.
,,Every time shopping experience...,5.0,,"You can buy most of things under one roof at reasonable prices. It is 24 hours ope. For the foreign travelers, there is a currency exchange counter is available and you can have a better exchange than hotel. Also, they have GST refund counter too."
,,Best Indian Food on Top floor,5.0,,"Largest international section with regional food we'd ever seen. It doesn't look like much on outside then there are 10 floors of everything (household goods, office supplies, to pet supplies to huge supermarket) ! Great place for international food items and souvenirs. The top floor (10th) is an Indian restaurant. The BEST Indian food and prices reasonably. Be prepared for crowds but worth it."
,,lot buy,4.0,,"he key is one need to know what he or she wants if no intention to spend time browsing through the stuff by just zip the maze and grab the stuff and go. Otherwise, one afternoon can be utilized in the mall and less bother about filling up the stomach when there are plenty of eateries nearby. Can be very crowded on very nice cheep something for evereyone"
,,Shopping place,5.0,,Found really nice and all variety of shopping here ranging from expensive branded stuff to cheap stuff in sale. Had a really good experience being in this place for shopping. I would suggest every shopping lover to visit this place.
,,Much better than Chinatown!,4.0,,"Usually China Town in any city is supposed to be the cheapest place with widest variety. Well mustafa near farrer park MRT is tough competition! Open 24 hours (expect the gold jewellery floor), it is the ideal place to shop for souvenirs to chocolates to gifts for all families! There are 4 gates of entry and each one of them opens to a different area. We found a lot of things there at cheaper rates compared to the regular shops. One good thing is everything is labelled with the price tag and you do not need to depend on the sales assistant for prices. Women may not find top quality clothes there, but men can find some good sportswear. electronics area is small and crowded and one will get confused there. the perfume section has a very wide variety of brands and all popular ones are available. Body,Hair and Skin care are regular brands and i did not see too many good korean brands. We found a fantastic collection of chocolates. Lindor was available at really cheap rates, but they were 2 months away from expiry. You will comfortable find haldiram and Bikaner there. There was a good colelction of ladeies bags from 20 to 80 Singapore dollars. basically the list will be endless and it will not be easy to find everything in one go. We had to visit twice after we realised that there was another wing that we ha not visited. Must visit for all those who need to buy gifts for friends and family!"
,,"24 hrs Cheaper shopping, but need energy to search",5.0,,"Feels like India around here. You can shop until you drop (whatever you want to shop especially electronics, bags) and have lunch/dinner at popular indian restaurants nearby and make it a perfect day. Dont forget to get GST slips in the 2nd level. You can compare the prices online before buying; my experience was they were quite cheaper than the dedicated plazas. But, you need search all round for your stuff... the staff is not knowledgeable, but only for watching. Better go prepared with what you want to purchase or you`ll end up going in rounds in multi-level floors."
,,Everything under one roof,3.0,,"The key is one need to know what he or she wants if no intention to spend time browsing through the stuff by just zip the maze and grab the stuff and go.

Otherwise, one afternoon can be utilized in the mall and less bother about filling up the stomach when there are plenty of eateries nearby.

Can be very crowded on weekends or public holidays."
,,MUSTAFA SINGAPORE,3.0,,"Its a nice supermarket akin to our Big Bazar in India. The only advantage is its open 24 hrs and one can get from ""pin to elephant"" in the place. Surroundings are dirty as in Mumbai/ Chennai/ Hyd or any other place. Good range of chocolates are available and they bare worth buying from here . Rest are normal products, basement also offers range of clothes for all."
,,"It's worth to have a visit, at least once",4.0,,"Even if you are not going to buy anything, it's worth to pay Mustafa a visit so that you can tell people that you had gone there !! Not everything is cheap, but if you know what you're after, have a look to see whether the price is competitive. They sell everything from medications, perfumes, cosmetics, electronics, shoes, food, jewelleries, cheap souveniers, etc. Money changer is also availabe outside the building, competitive rates (I used their facility to get some Singapore dollars). They have one whole floor of jewelleries, mainly gold, beautiful to look at even if you're not buying. The price of gold keeps changing everyday and it's actually quite competitive compared to other jewellery stores within Singapore.

My children and I bought watches, and my little one's Swatch was S$62 in Mustafa, and they sold for S$99 in Swatch stores !! So we were quite happy to get a bargain !!

Its location is not far from the MRT station, about 5 minutes walk.

Do go there empty handed as any shopping you brought had to be sealed before you entered the store and the place was not spacious and mostly busy so not carrying stuff around while shopping is handy. Forget about bringing in strollers, going to drive you crazy trying to stir it around the store (many levels with escalators)

To visit best avoid weekends, as I discovered when I visited on a Saturday, it was jam packed.

Lastly, don't forget to bring your passports so you can make a claim for the GST on the goods that you purchase. Makes your bargain purchase even cheaper !"
,,India in Little India!,3.0,,"Although we got what we went there for, but on sunday there were around 5 lacs persons, almost all indians, seems like we were somewhere in Old Delhi! Go if u want Indian type shopping!"
,,Place to visit for your shopping,4.0,,"Lots of variety: branded clothing, watches, shoes, make up, sports goods etc. Basically you can get everything under one roof...prices range from really cheap to very expensive. They do have toilets, which other reviews suggest that they are none, and yes they have proper ones. It is hard to communicate and ask for directions with staff as their English is basically zil. The shop isles are too narrow so can be a bit hard to walk around. But a good place to visit if you are looking for branded items or on a budget."
,,Night mare,3.0,,"Well this is not a palace where you can expect service so don't expect it. Isles are so small and packed. Good deals on sweets but clothes and other things are really expensive, no bathroom so make sure you are relieved before you go.

Better take a bus or metro it's right opposite faren park station. Supermarket has everything you need but beware of what you buy in terms of price"
,,Always a great experiance to shop,5.0,,"24 x 7, easy shopping huge varity, shop everything you need at great price, very fast billing, very fast GST refund counters, always a pleasure to shop at Mustafa. Great south indian restaruents near by make it all the more reasons to visit"
,,What don't you get here!,5.0,,"Went to Mustafa Centre to see if I can pick up a few things. I had heard a lot about this place as how big it is and how much stuff it has. But seeing is believing! This place is surely huge and has massive amounts of stuff - whatever you need in daily life can be found strewn across 7 floors of this huge supermarket. And that is what also makes it difficult to find the exact thing one is looking is for because there are too many choices and too much area to cover. For this one thing go to that end of this floor, for another thing go to another end of another floor. Just commuting inside this place is time consuming and exhausting. But that said, you can get almost anything you can think of."
,,Everything under one roof....,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is the best place to shop more in less time . Its huge spanning across mutliple buldings and multiple floors .They have everything under one roof be electronics , clothes , toys , shoes , bags , cosmetics , jewellery , groceries , tools , show pieces...you name it and its there. Its generally very crowded . Its better to go in the morning .They have mutliple billing counters so keep an eye on the less crowded ones. The are prices are also less as compared to other places though it is always wise to check and if you are travelling from overseas then its a option to check on the tax refund policy aswell....."
,,Shop like the locals do,3.0,,Cheap shopping for your everyday products. It's like a department store combined with your local pharmacy. A real bargain hunters paradise.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"This place is just perfect for shopperholics ......loads of variety and cheap prices on some products like watches,electronics,perfumes,etc."
,,I am directly say Mustafa center shopping mall is a big Chitt. I come in singapore 2008 to until 2012 I was continue buy,1.0,,So many things.but they are provide all chip item.They wants to say all is number one but quality number 2/3.And very fast all things damage. I buy 22k gold from them and then I go back my country. After few month later going to sell I get 19.76 k. So they are very funny.why they are lose me.please if any body wants to buy gold don't buy from them. Another one more things. There all electrical products quality also very poor.Thanks for read my comments.
,,Eclectic and nothing particularly special,2.0,,"Mustafa's is perhaps the most well known place for shopping in Little India and people flock here from all over the world. I've never been especially impressed: it's often crowded, and displays are organised haphazardly. Prices don't seem to be that much different from what you get elsewhere either. Admittedly, visiting today (on a Saturday at about lunchtime) there weren't too many people so it wasn't as crazy as it can be in the evening or on Sundays."
,,Beware of foreign exchange tricks,1.0,,"Tried changing some Thai Baht and Malaysian Ringit for a holiday. The rates are flashed on the LCD screens for all the see. But the counter would under-quote the rates in their favor. Its really blatant. they actually quote it using the ISO convention for SGD, so anyone that doesn't do their sums are bound to be confused. Was quoted by the teller SGDTHB at 24 when the rate on the board was 24.1 and SGDMYR 2.6 when the rate on the board was 2.632. When told of the mistake the teller just nonchalantly ignored me and said follow the board then. Please beware when changing money there! They might advertise the best rates but getting it is another story!"
,,Must Stuff centre,3.0,,"Must stuff is true for Mustafa as they seem to stuff every possible stuff under one roof. A 24-hr shopping place which is almost always crowded. Cant imagine from the outside that such a huge place wont have space to display stuff. We were amazed to see when we visited this the first time that best of brands in watches, shoes, clothing etc. are just displayed as if they are local brands. There is not enough space for them.
Once you enter you might get lost as to which floor and which section you are in and how to exit. The walking aisles are narrow and hence feels congested.
Avoid visiting the place on evening on a weekend and specially Sunday.
They have a average fast food outlet and a nice restaurant as well. There are washrooms inside but not clean.
If in Little India area then must plan to visit."
,,MUSTAFA – A CRAZY MUST SEE,4.0,,"Having been on previous trips to the famous Mustafa and taking into consideration current reviews we walked up there to see what changes have been made over the last few years. The place is huge we ran out of time even just to walk around. They do have the most amazing choice and fantastic prices given how expensive Singapore is. Next time we are going to start at the top and work our way down so we don’t miss out on anything. I think it would be impossible to leave without buying something. Perfumes were great prices they have a section for real ones and fakes so be sure to check also the beauty brands for the girls much cheaper than at Singapore chemists. Amazing selection of groceries and products and even the shoe section was worth a look. We found the service to be just fine, you have to consider the place is always packed and take your patience with you."
,,Not so impressed,3.0,,We visited Mustafa for about 1 hour and they have lot of things to sell there. The only things we bought was some medicine. For People coming from Europe this place is not the best shopping place.... But if you are in little India then visit and see for yourself.
,,Perfect household shopping,4.0,,"Though the layout is not very classy but the variety of product items are excellence! You name it they have it! You can check-in to hotel without bring along your toothbrush, toothpaste & etc. u can get all of them here."
,,Everything crammed under one roof,3.0,,"This is an old landmark in Singapore. A departmental store with virtually everything under one roof. Located in Little India, it is a good place to pick up some essentials you may have forgotten or some light snack. It is however, quite crammed and crowded and is very easy to get lost inside the myriad of entrances, aisles, floors and stairways. Not ideal to go in with small kids."
,,crazy shopping experience,5.0,,"This is a total onslaught to the senses. Being in Asia for the first time I expected something weird,but thought rather along the lines of European Malls. Boy, was I wrong! I was totally overwhelmed by the chaotic mall - every shelf is stuffed to the brim. Whatever you may need in your live at one point or another, I'd bet good money on it that Mustafa has it. What can I say - I LOVE IT!

Beware of the restroom facillities tho. Theo are more of the “hole in the ground, super hoovering“-variety."
,,A shopping adventure,4.0,,"If you haven't been, it's a shopping adventure I'd recommend. We have been every time we go to Singapore, and each time we seem to find another part to this amazing store that is spread over a couple of blocks. They sell just about anything you can think of. Some bargains can be found, but other things are no cheaper than elsewhere, but the variety is amazing. Be warned that on your first visit it will most likely seem disorganised, until you work out their system, and at times it can be very crowded. As it trades 24 hours my tip is go early in the morning to avoid the crowd."
,,This place has everything!,5.0,,"Food, jewellery, clothes, hygiene, sweets, souvenirs, household goods, hardware; this centre has it all. The locals shop here so it must be good.
Some Electronics on the ground floor but not much choice.
Prices are reasonable and quality varies from cheap mass produced to European brands.
DVDs and CDs section with some vinyl! Lots of Bollywood to choose from if that's your preference. I found a couple of classic DVDs for SIN7.90 each - bargain!
Located at the top end of Little India, the area hasn't been sanitised yet. Lots of small shops selling groceries, fruit and vegetables.
Easy to get to use the MRT and exit at Farrer Park."
,,shopping paradise,3.0,,"mustafa is like a boon to all those Indians who crave for Indian groceries. the shopping centre which is open 24*7 is a great place to buy a variety of goods from tooth brush to carpets and from car lubricants to homemade pickles. however certain goods look a bit too overpriced. if you are going for large scale shopping or just want to pick up some random stuff, the best time to head down there is early morning around six or seven. after shopping you could go grab yourself a plate of idlis or a cup of coffee from murugan idli shop down the lane. mustafa does not offer home delivery so be prepared to shell out a few bucks for a taxi. late it gets, tougher it becomes to find a taxi"
,,All in one place,3.0,,"Visited on Dec 26, 2014. Nearer MRT Station was Farrer Park @NorthEastLine. Lots of Indian restaurant around this neighbourhood. Money changers too - I guess you can get good exhange rates here. Been to Mustafa long ago and now its renovated and more decent and comfortable. Not all things were cheap here but acknowledged lots of varieties and cheap offered especially for chocolates and vitamins. The good thing is that it open 24 hours. Haply shopping !"
,,A to Z Store,4.0,,"The main hi point of the store is that it opens 24 hours a day and you can find literally anything that you want including pure jewelry and electronics items. But don't expect a high class organized store as you will find elsewhere in Singapore. The look is also different from inside, clumsy and disorganized. The service is poor. You will find many cheap North and South Indian eating places outside, but of poor quality."
,,Crowded Center,4.0,,"You can find many kinds of goods in this center, especially Halal food with rather reasonable price. Therefore, it is always crowded but it is worthy to visit."
,,All the things you need at one place,3.0,,It's a big place with a lot of items. Some of which are relatively cheaper. It's open 24 hours everyday so one can pop in anytime they want to check out the place. Don't expect any form of service as the people working there have to work long hours and best to ask them something if you really need it.
,,Great value but not great service,3.0,,"There is an amazing range of products in store - Indian, Asian, Chinese, Western - at great prices. Store is messy and disorganized and most cashier are harfly helpful. Some supervisors are extremely friendly and provides great advise."
,,"Don't bother visiting, not worth it.",1.0,,"Service non existent, staff not interested in helping. Hardly anyone on registers. The place is so filthy it's disgusting. Nothing in the shop that other places don't have. Absolutely OVERRATED!!!!!!!"
,,Crowded but worth it,3.0,,"Good place to go for shopping and short culinary excursion. Many options available thus cater for different tastes. The prices are also reasonable. For food excursion, many of the shops are opened 24 hours!"
,,What a place for shopping,5.0,,"If you wish to buy anything from one place then this is the best choice in Singapore. You can buy electronics to medicine everything in a single place. Jewelry or food item or anything you need in your daily life, have there. Products quality and sales persons attitude is good. Price is also very attractive. Just keep some time to move around and choice, which you need most. Transport is very easily have from the shopping Centre."
,,Not so nice,1.0,,"Very condensed large shopping place, would hate to be in there in case of fire. Went looking for gold jewellery, lots there but no better price than nice jewellery shops in Chinatown. Felt claustrophobic & difficult to find exit- did not enjoy experience."
,,Over rated,1.0,,"Mustafa centre is one huge shop that sells a variety of products such as perfumes, electronics, clothes and food. I waz under the impression is was individual shops but it was just one big shop. The prices were reasonable to expensive depending on your currency conversion. The clothes were limited with only a few brands and not current fashion. Overall no shout out if u go to Singapore and don't go to the centre you aren't missing out."
,,Good place for value shopping,4.0,,"Huge place with almost everything of daily use under a single roof. Most items reasonably priced and one needs lot of time to go through it. The plus point is that it's open 24 hours. And they have money changer shop, although the exchange rate is not so competitive. And chocolates are certainly cheaper than in duty free! The only non-customer friendly part is that the GST counter is tucked away in a corner in second level of basement. And the staff is not too cooperative - they were not willing to process the GST form on a photo copy of a passport but insisted on the original - now why will one carry original passport around. Other malls accept a photo copy since the refund occurs at the airport where original passport is required."
,,open 24 hrs,4.0,,4 floors of variety goods...like alladin cave....best buy is sing$1 extrafine nib hero fountainpen from china...drink authentic teh tarek in coffeeshop across the road
,,Best place for budget deals,3.0,,"Mustafa Centre - had heard about it so much before reaching Singapore that we had to make a visit.

Thankfully it was just behind our hotel and we could walk down.

But then sadly it wasn't upto our expectations of shopping. It was the best place for possibly bargain hunting and shopping.

Just that it wasn't us. We ended up spending time in their super market getting essential edibles for our kid and got out.

Would rate 3/5 for shopping experience but would rate 5/5 for bargain hunting deals."
,,One saturday,4.0,,"Went there one saturday . MY 3rd TIME around. First was when i was ask friend to come with me because i was afraid to go there alone because of. ..what my boss told me..."" Dont ever go to little india.."" because they had bad experience during their trip to singapore and their visit to little india. It has to do with gold i think. there were 3 of us who went there... We've ask our indian friend to come with us just in case someone is going to trick us. It was a fine trip. Because. Its my first time to experience Indian food. 2nd, when my friend asked me to accompany her because she needs to shop for giveaways. Well.. true. .not everything is cheap. Chocolates for instance... you can get a great deal from From other shops, like changi city point, lucky plaza, china town, bugis. But you have a wide range of selection though. If you need spices. .. a must place to visit. 3rd was yesterday. . Coz. Another friend ask me to accompany her. We bought tea... some are cheaper than other stores but some are not. We check some of the medical equipments. . Cardio stethoscope for instance Well cheaper... from what i know. But. Just be carefull... not everything is cheap if you want a great deal."
,,Must visit.,4.0,,"First time for us at Mustafa Centre. And WOW! got a lot of stuff for everyday use so much cheaper that at home. So we stocked up. The only thing that bugs me, is the fact that I bought a strap - that can be extended according to the worker there - and it can't. He didn't want me to open it. It also says it can be extended on the packacing, so now I am stuck with this useless strap. Other things bought are good and no problems. So make a list of items, like razors, blades, etc, and stock up! Even toothpaste."
,,"Told myself I wouldn't go this time, but I did!",3.0,,"Every time I visit Mustafa Centre, I declare that I won't ever go again, yet every time I return to Singapore, I'm inexplicably drawn towards it.

I very rarely find anything that I wish to buy because I get so confused with all the choices that I give up. Also, it is such a warren of narrow isles and crowded floors that just finding the Ladies' washroom is a nightmare. I dared ask a staff member (a lady) where the nearest one was and she just gave me a rude look and pointed her finger in the direction.

Don't get me wrong, it is worth a visit at least once for the experience and if you're like me, you never learn your lesson!

Also, just something which occurred to me on my last visit. Has anyone else ever wondered what it would be like if a fire was to break out in there during a crowded time (which is seems is always)? Perhaps it might be advisable to always keep aware of the nearest exit, however good luck in locating it."
,,So many things to buy here,4.0,,"I have to say, the perfume there is cheap!! I bought some for my family. There are lots more stuff to buy, like chocolates, souvenirs, t-shirts. I surely will come here again."
,,Take me back to shopping in india,3.0,,"Vale for money.. but crowded and lack of customer service.. people working there need to be trained for customer service.. I need to ask for help and only redirect to ask some one for help..

directions are not well marked, making things hard to find for infrequent users..."
,,Over crowded,3.0,,"A 24 hour open shopping centre in little india. Nyc deals esp for perfumes are here & also electronics. It is overcrowded..ppl r evrywhere lyk crazy grabbing stuff as if is for free..it is value for money for many & can be visited for experience. Needs time & patience here for sure...its has everything cosmetics,electronics,perfumes,clothes etc"
,,A lot to see and buy....,4.0,,"It will take nearly half a day or more. But is worth the time. I don't think there is anything that one wouldn't find in mustafa. Be careful when you buy perfumes, make sure they are original."
,,Value shopping,4.0,,"This is the place if you want value shopping options. You get most of the stuff at a decent price and its value for money. It can be very crowded at times, so you have to plan the time of the day accordingly."
,,Bargain hunter’s dream,5.0,,"Finally made it to Mustafa Centre after several visits to Singapore. First of all, the place is HUGE, with three stories of stuff, and more stuff. The range is ridiculous—from expensive jewelry and electronics, to chocolates and cheap tchotchkes.

I was looking for nothing in particular and roamed the entire department store. Came upon the women’s section on the third floor and waded through colorful blouses and saris. In the middle was a bin with a mound of discounted clothing—shirts, pants, scarves all piled on top of each other. It was all a bit like treasure hunting at a flea market.

If you’re looking to score a deal, definitely check out the Mustafa Center. Great place to buy souvenirs and staples, like shampoo and conditioner."
,,Cheapest keychains in town,3.0,,"Rumors had it that Mustafa had the cheapest souvenir prices and yes its true.It has Clothings, Gadgets as well. However, one would endure the smell and odor. By the way, its an air conditioned shopping place.One would also have the glimpse of Little India, their architecture, structures along the way."
,,An Evening Experience,4.0,,"We went at 9pm (it's open 24 hours) on the recommendation of locals.
Goodness knows what it would be like when it is truly busy, as it was pretty full!
Incredible range of everything from cooking implements to food to souvenirs to watches to really anything you could imagine. Not sure why they were souvenir London mugs there but I guess that shows the range.
Perhaps not for the faint hearted - everyone else appears to be a regular and knows what they want and where it is, but it is a real experience. Perhaps something a bit less sanitised that Singapore can be.
You'll either spend loads or not much at all!
It is a real experience, so go when you are in Sing!"
,,All in one place,5.0,,"Lots and lots of items from across the globe. You need something, you go to little india in Singapore and visit Mustafa. there is a high likelihood that you will find it. The prices are also very good."
,,Just like a huge Wal-mart,2.0,,"Floors and floors of ""stuff"" skin lotions, perfumes / colognes, clothes, shoes, some electronics, jewelry (primarilyIndian style..duh..). Prices just average. I prefer on-line shopping. Don't have to deal w crowds, and it's delivered. Had problems with language, don't they speak English here?!"
,,A Very Complete Shopping Centre!,5.0,,"The most complete and cheap shopping centre that I've ever went in Singapore. The place is 24/7. You can get everything here from snacks, shirts, electronics, and even housing tools. The only place that I can get my favourite snack (Lays special package). That's why this is the most favourite place to shop in Singapore!"
,,Great Prices,4.0,,"I really saw here cheap prices of perfumes, chocolates, give aways, make ups. It's a department store where Items are sold at fair prices. This is mostly dominated by Indians whom are not very good in conversing in English. However, this place has really nice bargains for budget travellers like me."
,,Mega shopping Centre,4.0,,"Mustafa centre is located in the Little India district.. It was at a walkable distance from our hotel so visited this place twice.. It is the best place to go if you wish to purchase stuff at reasonable price or want to enjoy shopping late night as it is open 24 hrs.
This place is not as fancy as the other malls of Singapore, but it has a great range of items and that too at a very good price. You can purchase anything and everything from here, be it food, groceries, confectionary, perfumes, clothes, footwear, make up, electronics, souvenirs, toys and games for kids etc etc.. The list is endless.. You name it, they have it.
Other services are also available here like money exchange, hotel reservations, visa assistance and many more..
Its a great shopping experience which should not be missed.. If i get an opportunity would love to visit this place again and again."
,,Day and night shopping under one roof,4.0,,"I have been to Mustafa Centre for several times. It's one of my ""must visit"" place when I am in Singapore.
This particular visit also include the jewellery section. Some staff in this section are not particularly helpful. Some are more interested in their mobiles and talking to their colleagues. The is no sense of urgency when customers asked to view the items.
The second building is better as the display items are more organized and lesa cluttered.
On the whole this is a great place to shop with competitive lower pricing.
Just walk across to the shops if you want to ""recharge"". There are plenty of choices from nasi briyani to roti to nasi with selection of meat and veggies."
,,"You want it, they got it",5.0,,"The most complete shop that open for 24 hours. You can spend hours in this shop and suddenly you're need extra baggage, which you can also buy there. There's also a nice restaurant rooftop. The price is not really cheap, however they got everything in bulk, and no haggling required and the selection is superb."
,,One stop shop,4.0,,"Located near MRT station - Farrer park. you got everything under one roof. crowded as usual even at 3.00AM. perfume deals are really attractive. more than 50% discount when you buy two of the promotional perfumes (Hugo Boss, Mont Blanc, CK....). prices are really attractive and most of the time less than local supermarkets. plenty of Indian restaurants around the Mustafa center where prices are reasonable.

perfumes are even cheaper than Changi Duty free.

what impress me most is the verity and stock... unbelievable."
,,A one stop shop for e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g,4.0,,"Where do I start? This is a place where you can find everything! From electronics to diapers. I promise you that there is something for everyone. You can even come to Singapore with the clothes on your back and buy everything here, toiletries, clothes (inner wear / outer wear), food, drinks, desserts, souveniers, cosmetics, just to name a few.

We can never spend an hour in here. There are 4 levels of joy shopping here and there's the old building and new building which are connected at the basement and level 2.

If you love to cook, there are thousands of spices, lentils, grains and what nots for you to browse and I dare you not to buy them. I always end up with a trolley full of food stuff that you can't find in the local supermarket. Of late (sept 2014), they brought in loads of different pasta sauces and pastas. The best part is the pricing is much cheaper compared to the local supermarts!

The vitamins / supplements seems to be much cheaper than other health stores too. My best buy would be the pregnancy kit which only cost $2.90! Oh and the postpartum binder, hand splint or hand / leg support stuff are almost 30% cheaper than hospitals and other shops.

If you never heard of Mustafa Centre and you're living in Singapore, stop reading this already and get yourself there now!"
,,Good place to buy food & Cosmetics,4.0,,"You can easily reach this by NE Line and by getting down at Farrer Park station. Eventhough the prices are standard everywhere here you’ll get bundled offers for most cosmetics and you’ll get whatever the foodstuff you’re looking for weather its Indian, western or Arabic.
If you buy a lot sometimes you have to wait outside longer because there can be a long queue for taxis. If it’s raining forget about getting a taxi and enjoy a cup of coffee at a nearby shop, because you won’t get a taxi until rain stops."
,,Watch out for clothes,2.0,,"I went to Mustafa based on excellent review to buy expensive branded shirts. They looked good in sealed covers. When I asked what was wrong with them because they were discounted I was told they were getting rid of old styles and there was nothing wrong with the shirts.
i was told to try on the shirts in opened packets for size which I did. I greedily bought 5 shirts and spent approx $ 200.

After I got back home and started to use the shirts I found all 5 had serious stains which could not be removed by any means.
Beware of smart packaging which conceal the defects [ unless the packets are opened]."
,,Shopping destination for all,4.0,,"This place is a super mall at super prices. You can find almost everything and the best part is it is open 24*7. Go there for any bulk shopping of electronics, clothes, household stuff etc. However it gets really crowded at times and a not a very convenient place to shop. But definitely a one time visit if you have a week at least in Singapore."
,,A gigantic store,4.0,,"Located in the Little India neigbourhood and within walking distance from the LRT North East Line's Farrer Park station.

It seems you can find anything at Mustafa Centre. A variety from food, drinks and spices to souvenirs and toys to clothing and jewelry to hosehold appliances and electronic goods. And all for reasonable fixed prices (no bargaining accepted). Payments can be done in cash and by credit card. There's also a money changer of you need to exchange foreign notes.

The immense size of the area makes finding things a small adventure of it's own.

Also, it's open 24-hours so your not afraid to run out of time to find something."
,,"Of course, terrible experience........",1.0,,"Omg!!!! What an atrocity!! It was very bad shopping i ever had. Its better to do shopping in entire market. Because we can single out the shop and purchase. But in mustafa everything is confused. No guide... no hospitality... no proper arrangement... we have to search... search...search... unnecessary questions r asked in gst claiming counter. The person is sleeping in information counter. We cant select the products properly as the place is so congested. No place to walk. Even at t.nagar, chennai, i never experienced like this. Overrated products...... please do shopping in better place.."
,,Anything you want!,5.0,,"Shopping at Mustafa Center is definitely an experience everyone should have in Singapore. One complex with everything from food to toys to clothing to car accessories and everything in between. The prices are reasonably cheap, but not so cheap that the merchandise is junk - the quality of everything seemed pretty good."
,,Kind a Mall-Supermarket,5.0,,"Don't have time to shopping from mall to mall? Don't have time to buy souvenirs? Don't have time to buy food, drinks, snack, cosmetics, groceries, etc..... Then just go to Mustafa Centre. I found almost all needs in here!"
,,A mist visit place,5.0,,"If you're looking for cheap item, but good quality, you have to come here! I came because they have promotions on perfume. Buy 2 perfume and get it at a cheaper price. I bought 2 bottles of J.LO GLOW at only SGD40 and VERSACE RED JEANS at SGD29."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"This was on our list of places to visit on advice from some fellow travellers and we were not disappointed. It is a short walk from Farrer Park MRT station in the Little India area of Singapore. What a place! Seven floors of shopping. You name it they have it. All the usual department store goodies plus groceries and fresh food as well.The range is mind boggling. We found staff were helpful. It is not a glamorous Singaporean type store but it is what it is, a down to earth, good value, no frills type store. Plenty of cashiers on each floor. Tourists can claim back the GST and they have a special section in the basement to sort out the paperwork for that. I would allow at least half a day to explore and it will probably not be long enough. It is open 24/7. Try the rooftop restaurant Kebabs n Curries as well, it is superb."
,,"what you want,you wanna get there",4.0,,"Mustafa center located in ethnically rich little india,offer the complete stuff in singapore,open in 24/7,come and see into it,what you look for,you wanna get there...fell contented."
,,Shopping Madness in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are crazy over perfumes, chocolates and Indian food,this is a place to go.To me, these are the items worth buying.It is opened 24 hours-unbelievable! To get here, you can use the MRT-stop at Little India station, bus or taxi.If you are hungry, head to any halal Indian restaurants nearby."
,,"You name it, You have it",5.0,,"Amazing shopping place. You'll get everything literally everything in this shopping center. You name a thing you have it.. Prices are very affordable.. Staff is very good.... This place is huge so you have to ask for assistance to find a thing as signboards are not placed properly. It also has one travel agency and forex center. It provides cheapest exchange rate in whole Singapore, I think. A complete solution to everything."
,,Not much for tourists (especially Indian origin),3.0,,"The market is huge - with almost each and every product imaginable for sale. Moreover, the market remains open 24X7 which is impressive.

But for a tourist, there is not much - goods aren't that cheap. The rush, and the lack of clearly marked directions lead to chaos. May be a good spot for shopping for locals, but for tourist - only a visit of not more than 2 hours would all I recommend."
,,A mall which has everything.,3.0,,Mustafa is huge.they have different items on each floor eg clothing.food.electronics watches.gold etc.the inventory is huge.every item is present in stacks upon stacks.gets very crowded on weekends.prices are reasonable esp clothing.electronics.watches.foodstuff.
,,Please be awared the imitation Goods! Fake!!!!,1.0,,"I visited Singapore during 9-11 August ,2014. with my family, this is our first time there.
We went to Mustafa on 11 Aug, and bought a lot of stuffs over there, including perfume.>> The one is ""Burberry Brit Sheer"" , the price is quit low compare to other shop.
However, seem like i've got the fake products.
>> take a look what i've got from your store. I don't know what happen?
The packaging is look similar, but the goods inside is totally difference.
Recommend to open up the package once you buy anything there before move on."
,,What a shop !,5.0,,"We went to the Mustafa centre and could not believe how big this place is! It is full of everything you need and more of what you did not know you wanted. If you want to spend half a day look around 1 department in this place, be warned though it could easily turn into a full day. Even if you don't need to buy anything go just to see this fascinating ""shop"""
,,Everything under one roof,3.0,,"I visited this place yesterday. A very good mall which is open 24X7 and sells almost everything in clothing, household items, gifts, jewelry etc. A very good collection across the product line.

The place is overcrowded, walkways are very small and staff sometimes are not very helpful. Specially some of the staff are not very friendly and helpful in jewelry section. One time visit for tourists bound to Singapore.

The biggest issue for a first time visitor is EXIT from the mall. There are many exit signs but some of them are false :) I had to struggle to get out of the place."
,,"Always crowded, how is that possible?",4.0,,"Does not matter what time I go there, even at 3am, it is feels like 8pm! This is the place you need to go to, to get everything under 1 roof. However, the things are not as cheap as 15 years ago."
,,"Crowded, messy but very complete store! Everything can be found here!",4.0,,"I like Indian foods and I can buy many here! From Singapore chocolate, Lindt, Figs, cellotape, Indian snacks, lentils, chickpeas, bags, cakes, and other electronics we can buy here! If u wanna go here, stop at FARRER PARK MRT! And walk a bit, then u'll see the big Mustafa Centre. Near a lot of Indian and Moslem restaurants! I ate Indian pizzas, and I love them.."
,,buy what u wanna buy....,4.0,,"what you want and you will get here.....everything available here... u can buy anything likes electronic items, bag, chocolate, medicine, beauty cosmetic, anything parfume, etc..."
,,Nice refreshing tea,4.0,,"For most people, Mustafa is just shopping. But when you get very tired, it is a good idea to go to the terrace restaurant and have a refreshing cup of tea. The masala tea is recommended and then get back to shopping again."
,,good,3.0,,"A big market. Inside you feel like in an old china market. It is very conjusted inside. You can buy clothes, electronic items, food items, medicine and such."
,,Junk galore,2.0,,"This place is where souvenir shops must send their unsold stuff to go to die. I swear there are shirts from 1983 in the basement here. The staff is not at all friendly and while haggling is to be expected, the aggressive tactics are not awesome. The merchandise encompasses every type of souvenir, tacky junk, and even electronics. Prices are really not that cheap considering the setting."
,,wonderful shopping experience,5.0,,Wow one should and must visit this store beleive me after i shopped here and went to Malaysia and Indonesia for shopping for things which i could not buy due to lack of time found the prices costlier by 40% dont ever miss the oppurtunity if you want to buy something then go ahead and buy in Mustafa shopping and travel to Singapore is incomplete withut Mustafa
,,Primarni... Indo-Singaporean style...,3.0,,"Reminded me a little bit of Primark Oxford Street... except with normal items. Absolute chaos on Saturday night before Diwali and stuff anywhere. Ok visit for a laugh, and to see the Indian side of Singapore... but wouldn't exactly stick it on a Singapore hit list."
,,Sells (almost) everything you can think of!,4.0,,"I love to shop here although the centre is located in a considerably 'rough' area. Opens 24-7. Things are not all cheap, but majorities are cheaper than supermarkets. Sells both local & imported products. Items on shelves are mostly dusty so it's a good idea to bring wet wipes for your hands afterwards. Not a good idea to bring young kids (especially at night) when the place can get super crowded even on weekdays. Strollers are a big no-no due to space constraint. And, be wary of pickpockets."
,,Worth going,4.0,,"Went to Mustafa Centre after such a long time (perhaps more than 8yrs). What a change. So many things to choose from ranging from toys section, slippers & shoes stack up to the brim of metal shelves, starting from B2 up to level 4. One can spend whole day there. Even bigger than Isetan. They are selling all things as a wholesaler so it is definitely worth it to go there. I've been to Turkey and I can find chocolates and spices from there. Fine chocolates directly from Switzerland and it is cheaper here than Switzerland itself. In fact I don't have to buy things overseas as I can find almost everything & anything here in Mustafa Centre."
,,All day Mall,4.0,,"It is only mall in the city which remains open 24x7. Here one can find most of the items one looks for right from watches, jewellery, gold, consumer electronics and all. However I have seen the quality of stuff has gone down over the years here. It is more of departmental store than mall. You can see tourists flocking to this mall in great numbers. Anyway worth one time visit for your shopping needs."
,,A shopping place that has everything,5.0,,"From money changer to dairy products, this place sell lots of things. Clothing, medicines, DVDs and CDs, Electronics, Perfumes, Gold & Jewellery, Toys, Candy & Chocolates, Souvenirs, Shoes, Personal Hygiene and many other things with a lower price. Its an 24-hours Shopping Centre. What's better than an affordable 24 hours Shopping Paradise?

Mustafa centre located in Little India. It surrounded with lots of different Indian shops. Mustafa has 2 buildings with 2 Basements and 4 Level up. Basically its a huge place. Don't worry about long queue on the cashier because the have many cashiers around the mall. They are everywhere. If your bill is above $ 100 don't forget go to Basement 2 with your passport in hand to get a refund receipt at the GST Tax Refund Desk near the electronic section.

Put an extra care to your belongings when you walk around in this place. Because this place always pack with full of people. Unless you go here after midnight/ Late night shopping. Please, don't go here on the Weekends. There's a chance you might get lost or robbed. Its not suitable for tourist that travel with younger kids.

I suggest you come and return by a taxi. To get a returned taxi might be tricky because you will compete with other people. You can queue at the Taxi Stand or walk and find a spot with lesser people. Your chance to get a taxi will be higher. So, enjoy and have a safe and fun shopping."
,,Harrod's for Tat,4.0,,"Let me get this out of the way: I love Mustafa. I think the entire place is just bonkers, but has a certain charm to it that keeps me coming back for more.

To the uninitiated, Mustafa is a multi-building, multi-block department store. Well, I say department store, but it really is just a store that sells seemingly everything. Located in the Little India neighbourhood, the store is located amongst many Indian restaurants and the like, but is really nothing to look at externally. Come to think of it, there's really nothing interesting to look at inside either, aside from the huge amount of tat that is sold, however!

So once inside, there are perhaps 6 floors of stuff to search through. And when I say ""search through"", I really mean search. To my eyes, the store doesn't have any real ""flow"" to it and finding stuff is far from straightforward.

And herein lies the charm: one should go to Mustafa and just wander. You'd be amazed at some of the stuff you'll find. Stuff that you never even knew existed!

On top of this, stepping inside the store is like stepping into a bustling melting pot of people. Whilst the store is Indian and there are lots of Indian clientel, there are plenty of people from all walks of life in there, which makes the experience all the more cool.

So, will I go back? Definitely. The next time I need a 4K flat screen TV, tube socks, dental floss, fresh fish from the fish monger, an Indian dress for my daughter, and some ""Wild Oats"" sex pill supplements, you know where to find me!"
,,Dazzling gold jewellery,3.0,,"I went to Mustafa to check out their famous gold inventory.
They did not disappoint. The gold jewellery pieces range from rings, necklaces, and bracelets. All of them were chunky pieces. It must be tiring on the neck to be wearing those thick and heavy necklaces.
The price of gold was clearly displayed on an overhead board. It was much lower than any of the gold shop I have seen. The converted price was even lower than the spot gold price. I got suspicious and so asked one of the older servers. He admitted that their unit was a 'gold metric gram', which is different from gram as in gram and kg. I may be naive, I have not heard of such a unit. As such, price comparison becomes impossible since I don't know how that is calculated. To the unknowing, this is a point worth taking note of."
,,everything you need,5.0,,what you want and you will get there. The mall is Hugh and it is open 24hrs.It sell range from diamond to everthing you can think of
,,Shopping place for local people,4.0,,"Big, can spend a few hours there. Lot of things to buy, supermarket, clothes, shoes, electrical appliances.. Convenient location, next to Farrer Park MRT. Good for tourist if you want to buy local things."
,,The place needs arranging,3.0,,Many cheap stuff available here especially watches. But...the place needs arranging. Items like clothes were disorganised and many last season items were sold with non competitive price.
,,Nothing is special here,2.0,,"In my opinion, this mall is just a mall and it seems dirty place for me. There are many items here and the most popular item is the perfume. I really don't know why.. But for me, many perfumes here look fake and not cheap at all. I prefer to buy the perfume in the duty free. The staffs are quite ok. My sister and I visited here and bought only chocolates lol."
,,Get everything that you need at MUSTAFA,5.0,,"one can get anything that you need in life at Mustafa, not sure how they manage to run 24/7. great place to visit, If you are tourist and do a purchase of 100SG$ you are eligible for GST refund please preserve the bill and endorse the same in GRT counter in the basement at Mustafa. Staff is really great!"
,,Its huge and opens after 10pm,4.0,,Its open after 10pm...what else can we.ask for? Its a huge department store...its not a.mall...but its full.of anything you could ever want....period...there is nothing on orchard road which you cant find here.. And did i say that its open after 10pm?....:)
,,Favorite place for tourist shopper,4.0,,"This place are so famous for tourist that went to SG. You can buy anything from groceries to gold watch.

On September 14, 2014, I went to Mustafa and they offer great discount on Parfume, like Davidoff Coolwater if you buy 1 the price is SGD 75 but if you buy 2 it is only 65 SGD. Also for CKbe 100 ml buy 1 its 55 but for 2 is only 45 (this price is only figure as far as I remember, you should check for more details)
They also offer Toblerone Chocolate 1000g bundle for 6 stick only SGD 11.50.
For luggage they offer SGD 49 if you buy two I forget that brand (maybe POLO).
Actually I found simply POLO luggage with only SGD 28, and I already prove it to carry my 20kg stuffs on it.

You can go to Mustafa by MRT and go down on Farrer Park Station. Just follow the direction on MRT Station then you wouldn't be lost.

My tips:
Don't go to Mustafa on weekend, it is very crowded. And also it is hard to found Taxi on midnight. I must waiting for almost an hour.

The rest is perfect place to shop here. I never miss this place every time I came to SG :)"
,,shopping at mustafa,4.0,,spent 3 hours shopping in Mustafa. one of the biggest shopping centers for electronics. New range of products on display.
,,An institution,4.0,,"It has become monstrously big since we were last here, Great to have a 24 hour exchange shop & I think the entire Dept store trades round the clock as well. Good value and you will never get fleeced."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Its a big shoping mall, we can find almost everything here. Its very busy in weekends.We can buy electronics, grocery etc.. we can find almost everything in this shopping mall."
,,Great place,4.0,,The shopping centre itself is realtively cheap and crazy busy but it is the shops on all the streets in Little India that have the bargains.Cheap clothes and tourist items.Restuarants are cheap too. Well worth a look just for the interest factor..
,,Not that great,3.0,,Its a big shopping mall... Lots of space and you can get lost in it. However I didnt find things that cheap here compared to china town. Especially if you are buying souvenirs I would suggest to go to Chinatown
,,24/7 Shopping City,3.0,,"Why I say its a shopping city? Its soooo HUGE. Its a big building that has everything on it. I got dizzy. Population is about 90% Indians. Categorized per wing, and per floor. Spend most of my time in the chocolates wing. Where I got most of my take home goodies for my family. :-)"
,,A massive shopping centre!,3.0,,"As the title says, this place is everything you can spend your money on. From designer watches, electronics, perfumes, clothing, groceries to soap. It does get really busy on Sundays, due to the local workers being off."
,,Everything you could think of,4.0,,"This is a huge shopping centre, it has absolutely everything in it! From key rings to mobile phones and clothes and more. It is very good value for money and always very busy!"
,,A world in one shop,4.0,,"Gold jewelry, watches, chocolates from across the world & Samsung accessories! Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Overrated shopping centre,2.0,,"After my home country Indonesia, Singapore is a second home to me.Being of Indian origin, a visit to Little India is a must. At first I did all my shopping in Mustafa. But gradually I discovered that prices there arw generally more expensive than other malls in Singapore. Be it watches, jewelry or even perfumes. The only items you shop there are Indian products which you wont get else where in Singapore or even Jakarta. Of course the service, presentation and shopping comfort is terrible, very terrible. You will keep bumping into people, the staffs are very much reluctant, yes very much reluctant is the word to be of any service and don't even dream of visiting the toilet :)"
,,A must see in Singapore !!!,5.0,,"It could be the size
It could be the range of products offered
It could be the dense crowd there
It could be that it's open 24/7

Nothing really beats mustafa for cheap and exotic shopping !

It's basically a huge department store in the middle of little India. You can buy anything from visa to India to canned food to Malay movies to washing machines to watches to carpets to ...

Truly impressive place!

It's not very posh though - for LV, go to orchard !!!

But for the experience go to mustafa :-)"
,,Nightmare shopping,2.0,,"My sister heard a lot about mustafa a centre and decided to check it out. Seriously, if you like the finer things in life, this place is not for you. I love bargains but place is poorly presented. Products are stacked up worst than a cheap supermarket such as ALDI or LIDL. My sisters who live in Malatsia thinks it's a bit like Mydin supermarket. The alley is very small and people keep bumping into you making it a terrible shopping experience. Some stuff are cheap if you like cheap full stop. clothes are of poor quality. Perfumes who have been around for a while are cheap and some customers said they were original. This place is open 24 hours, lots of places to eat but they are all curry houses. Quite expensive food and not so nice. I was told many Singaporeans go to johore Bahru to shop, so they obviously find JB shopping is cheaper. I would vote Mustafa Centre as ""give it a miss""."
,,Not SO impressive,3.0,,"Heard a lot about Mustafa, but did not find it very good. Huge stock, but also a lot of clutter. Practically no moving space between the alleys and racks. Reminded me of our Big Bazaar over here."
,,Was pleasantly surprised,4.0,,I had seen Mustafa centre on Anthony bordain and I thought it look chaotic and a little scary. I went on a Thursday morning and was quite pleasant. It's as close to a Walmart you are going to find in this city.
,,Never seen so many watches in one place!!,5.0,,"We had no idea what to expect when we turned the corner into the street that houses this store. It is a multi level store that had everything you could ever imagine from watches to groceries to linens to car items to spray paint. It was a Tuesday night at 8:30, I can't even imagine how crazy it must be on weekends. It's open 24 hours and there is an MRT right outside. We were only there 45 minutes and barely scratched the surface. Going back tomorrow!!"
,,Heard bad things but was suprised,4.0,,Heard lots of bad things about this complex and it's locality however it was quite clean and well organised. Items were all clearly marked and presented. Fairly cheap prices for souvenirs and Items from India. Almost impossible to get a cab outside though
,,aladdins cave - anything and everything anyone could want!,5.0,,"A real experience, massive and crammed to the rafters with products as varied as gorgeous sari fabrics and golden jewellery to electronics, toiletries and sportswear. A real eye opener and everything seemed much cheaper than in the UK. If you're in Little India, Singapore! well worth a walk round for the experience."
,,Not a must visit place but ok if u have time,3.0,,"Good place. You can get food, can shopping everything (souvenirs, chocolates too) etc in cheap price?????. It have money changer near by. City square mall is on walking distance.

It is definitely a good place if u r an indian and staying in singapore for more than a month. You can refresh here by having taste of India."
,,The place is sooo Indian 8-),4.0,,"Love the place and the prices are certainly made for the local people.

The money exchange is close to the ball which makes it my first port of call when arriving into Singapore.

Love their items and the security of the gold area is second to Fort Knox.

The average western tourist must realise that this is ""little India"" however this is only a veil and once passed it you will certainly come back to to it on your next stop-over. I have lost count on how many times I come back here."
,,Nothing great,3.0,,"What is good
1. A good variety of products
2. Too huge there is hardly anything you won't get here
3. Chocolates are very good
4. Lots of tills so one can avoid long queues
What is not good
1. Too cramped. Many places trolleys don't even go
2. Unfriendly staff
3. Aisles are full of dust
4. There are products sitting in the shelves for over 2 years. One has to watch the mfg date of every product
5. I doubt the genuineness of electronic products.
I feel mustafa became famous in an era when electronic items were unaffordable in India. Now you get stuff at a cheap price in India too. So mustafa has only a historic significance in the singapore trip.
But it's still worth a visit for the way they manage the inventory and range of products. But the overall expirience will be average."
,,Complete and Cheap,5.0,,"I usually go to Mustafa Centre to buy chocolate for family when I back home. So far, I never feel dissapointed with the shopping experience there. The snack and chocolate range are very complete and cheap, I never buy other products but seems like the watches, household, etc are interesting to explore. Also the money changer in front of the supermarket has competitive rate."
,,Big Bazaar Of Singapore,3.0,,"well the title is good enough for every Indian to get the gist of my review. If you want to travel all the way from India to Singapore and would get excited by visiting the local 'Big Bazaar"" - then Mustafa Centre is for you. Here you get everything

* Lots of Crowds
* Stuffy sections with lots of jostling around
* Repeat inventory mostly of goods that are now commonly available in India
* Prices which perhaps might be cheaper in India- but then you are shopping in Singapore!!! so why not pay them more for the same stuff

......overall my advice is AVOID , and spend your precious vacation time in exploring more of wonderful Singapore...."
,,Good deal,4.0,,"I just popped in to Mustafa very quite happy to do it early morning as later part went it gets busy not my choice for shopping.Had a good deal on my cologne which I usually buy here at Sgd37.5 for a 100ml and today was shocking 2x100ml was Sgd 40.00.
Also bought some spices and they always a variety of brands on each particular spices . Recommended but try to beat the rush hour.Best time 7am -10am ."
,,shopping all you need or just walk around is FUN,4.0,,"Mustafa is the place you should go , at least ONCE while you are in Singapore . For us , we always come back again and again whenever we are in Singapore , present us with huge selection of goods , from gold to grain to glue . It is nice to navigation to find goods that we need :-) ."
,,An experience but prices too high,3.0,,In years gone by this was the place to shop duty free but now you will find it difficult to find any bargains in what is probably Little India's richest Indian entrepreneur. Still the experience of the visit is worth it and don't miss the supermarket upstairs with a selection of sweets and chocolates you will find difficult to resist. After shaves and perfumes are cheaper by far at the airport duty free shopping but it's easy to get caught up in the volume of goods and the holiday atmosphere.
,,For the shopping desperado,3.0,,"The only place that I know works 24x7x365. Even the money changer works round the clock.

This building has everything that you would ever need under one roof.

The crowds could be a big turn off. Weekends are very busy. Moving your cart around itself could be an adventure.

I always visit them at early hours."
,,Oh my goodness!,5.0,,"Now. ... even if you don't need to buy one single thing. ...GO. watch people. .. THINK about how the inventory of millions of products. ... LOOK at how they manage the crowds. ... SEE how easy they make it for you too check out anywhere no matter what items you have bought ( I saw people buying groceries in the luggage department! )....HEAR all the different languages. ..OBSERVE all the different attire people are wearing. ..... oh goodness. ... it is truly something!

If you DO need to buy something. ... well. .... they most likely have it!
Go. Take money. Expect to be there for a few hours! Exciting interesting compelling. Go! Go!"
,,Very big staff are rude some were asleep,3.0,,"If you miss this place no big deal there are approximately 7 floors extremely big and everything you can imagine is there from Brand names to no names the staff in the phone section were so rude 3 young men just stood there talking behind the counter just ignoring us some poor old man came up to serve as just glaring at the young sales man. then in the clothes section there was someone on every checkout obviously bored, one was asleep. We did get a really good camera tripod for our daughter very cheap pays to know your prices."
,,april 14 visit to Singapore,3.0,,"Large selection of goods and products. Almost everything available under one roof. Information, Vat Refund, and other staff very quite friendly and polite. The Cashier was snobish, and didn't talk politely my my kids."
,,Shopaholic's heaven,5.0,,The last itenary on my short visit to Singapore was Mustafa. Amazed is the word I wud use to describe when i got in there. The range of choices at some point even confused me. After 2 hours I was lost. I regret I shud have chosen this as the first place of visit in Singapore.
,,Bargain retail therapy,3.0,,"It has one of the most complete collection of anything that you need, from groceries to electronics, perfume, clothes and many more! Worth spending some time to walk around though it is not very clean. I went on a weekday afternoon and the whole place was not too crowded. A place that might not be everyone's liking but if you want some bargain, then it's where you need to be!"
,,Different but nice,4.0,,"The only 24 hr shopping centre in Singapore. Lots of shoppers at any given time. Been coming here for years and the best time IMHO, to visit is around 3am in the morning, I was jet-lagged! Mega range of products offering, from any price range. There is always something for everyone here. Not as organised or clean as other shopping centre. Dont forget to deposit yr bags/backpacks or get it zip tied by the security at the entrance. There r restaurants at the entrance or at the top most level serving great food but a little more expensive comparing w other restaurants around the area."
,,24 hour retail therapy,4.0,,"Open 24 hours almost anything you want can be found here except the high end brands. Mustafa offers something for every one. If you are looking for the sophisticated shopping experience, you will not find it here. The best currency exchange rates can be found here. Very popular with South Indian tourists. Not a must do really."
,,Shopping 24x7,5.0,,"Along with a 24 hours operation, this shopping stands with the best collection on almost anything and everything that you can think of shopping. If you're tired with the typical Singapore day and look forward to shop at night by avoiding the heat, Mustafa Center awaits you with millions of their products. There are good street food shops and restaurants around to supply you with more energy when you're hungry. Sued Malai Road and Desker Road is a buzzing place for those who lusts Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Nepalese Food. There are also travel agencies, money exchange shops, ATM's, courier services and very affordable accommodations around. So all I gotta say is ""Very very happy shopping""."
,,Revolting,2.0,,"I am 24 years old and this place was reviewed as a must see. All I have to say is that if you want to shop at a over crowed smelly cash and carry, then go here. Otherwise, it is smelly, lacking service and over priced. I didn't found anything there that I couldn't find in the supermarket or market for any cheaper. No one really speaks English either and GOOD LUCK getting a taxi back to Orchard road around 9pm. If you only have a few days here in Singapore, don't bother with this spot."
,,Love it or hate it it's pretty amazing,5.0,,"Not to everyone's liking for sure. It is massive, busy, chaotic in some ways with its own mysterious organization in others. It really does come close to having everything, even NZ Weetbix.

My wife simply loves the fabric section and has bought pieces to make her own clothes from. The grocery section is huge with great variety of fresh and packaged goods. We have bought spices to take home. According to our friends it is not always the cheapest for some items so don't think it is the bargain hunters paradise.

Set so close to a multitude of awesome restaurants it is a great place to wander around and then escape from for a wonderful lunch. Certainly gets busier in the evenings."
,,"Great experience, good bargains",4.0,,"It's a little bit of everything under the one roof. Think department store, warehouse, supermarket and discount store rolled into one.

I've purchased watches here at very good prices, running shoes too. Good choice of kids toys for the travelling father too!

Personally I love it - the service can be lacking, but it's all part of the experience!"
,,Everything under the sun but don't expect any service.,3.0,,"This is the only shopping mall that operates 24 hours a day n 365 days in a year in singapore.
They have everything under the sun...from supermarket stuffs to gold to electronics to hardware...
But don't expect any customer service from the staff. Most of them are not helpful n even rude. They prefer to talk among themselves.
The things are not necessary the cheapest altho most items are competitively priced.
If u go on weekends n PH, prepare for crowd n long queue at cashier. Some nationalities tend to jump queue n it makes the situation worse.
Watch out for your belongings when it is crowded.
when buying food stuffs or skin care, check expiry dates."
,,24 Bargain Shopping,5.0,,"What more is there to say? You can buy practically anything, anytime at prices that are so cheap you'll think you're reading the tag wrong."
,,All that you need in 1 place,5.0,,"Its always crowded and the hustle never stop even through the night and this place had literally everything from electronics (utilities-phone casings) to clothings,perfumes to shoes,not to mention each and every type of snack,gifts and even chocolate. All that you need in one place. A day is not enough to spend there and its definitely in moderate and affordable price. Highly recommended for all travellers."
,,Saravana store of singapore,4.0,,"what to say. bigger size saravana store priced in SGD.

good

1. you can talk in tamil (as like chennai) or hindi. almost all staff are tamilians
2. lot of varities in 3 buildings
3. quality & cheap products
4. no international warranty on electronic goods like camera, costly watches, laptop etc.
5. luggage are so good.
6. billing at any place is good.

not good

1. no shop layout in entrance as we cant identify which product as every building has same product.
2. perfumes are not maintained or no support to select.
3. lift is too crowded due to narrow conditions.
4. toilets are hidden.

fire escape routes are not really visible."
,,"Mustafa Centre has every thing, you just name it and you will get in mustafa",4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is also very good. the Big Store contain each and every thing...Clothes, Electronics, Mobile, Accessories, Medicins,Toys, Sports Goods, Watches, Sunglasses, Shoes.....but but but prices in mustafa are higher than outside shop's..."
,,Will not go there again,2.0,,"I went here because of the positive reviews and i was looking forward to shop for some cheap souvenirs. Well, the place is like a department store where they have everything except it is overwhelming with products that caused very little space to move around. It is tight and unorganized. Souvenir shirts were all over and they were on different floors. I got some playing cards for 3 sgd each and shirts are like 14 sgd.
Then i went to chinatown only to find playing cards at 3 packs for 10 sgd. Shirts are about the same but chinatown is cheaper. Dont go here if you are souvenir shopping. Go to Chinatown...."
,,very complete store,4.0,,"it was my 3rd time to visit this store last month. and my main purpose to go here is to buy chocolate, because in this store you can find many variation of chocolate.
just by walking about 2 minutes from my hotel, mustafa centre is very complete store, you can find everything that you want to buy in here. daily goods, cosmetic, food, electronic, souvenir, etc
it price cheap rather than other store.
this place operate 24hr..so you can go here any time.
after you buy some stuff ,dont forget to claim your gst refund at level B2

one thing that less in this store is.. the most of the cashier is lack of smile..,
i hope the management will fix it..becouse i love to shop in mustafa center"
,,The ENDLESS Stock,5.0,,"The place is so well stocked up with the things that you can not see all even in one full day. you have everything under one roof from food , grocery to GOLD and electronics and almost everything and stock for everything is so large that it can serve almost 10000 families in one GO and the GOLD store was SO big that may be having tonns of GOLD. Admirable for seeing and shopping"
,,Cheap,4.0,,A bit messy and crammed with everything. the perfume is so cheap here. good that its 24hours shopping mall.
,,Have to see,4.0,,This is a very daggy shop but a must see after you have wandered around little India.there is everything there very cheap. We did not buy anything because we were not really sure how to buy things.
,,Large size of departement store,4.0,,Huge supermaket and departement store. We can find lots of products in this store. The price of the products are not expensive. The money changer rates were good.
,,"Bring your own Toilet Paper (and a sales assistant too, if you can!)",1.0,,"The place is too crammed for space with barely enough space for you to push the trolley through the aisles. Sometimes you push a cart half-way through an aisle before you realize that it is blocked, and have to drag the trolley out the way you came because there is no where to turn!

Toilets are filthy, and the main reason being there is NO TOILET PAPER! That was a first in Singapore where even public toilets are very well maintained.

Talk about sales assistants, they all have the same tired look and points you aimlessly here and there. I normally don't ask them anything because of my experience from the past. Even if you go to the jewelry (where you are forced to get assistance), the attitude of the staff is terrible. I had to wait like 25 minutes in the jewelry (after which i gave up and walked away) for someone to assist me. Even though there were others around, they said i had to wait for that particular assistant who mans that particular counter if i wish to buy!

Many items are cheap, but the overall experience is just bad.

Tip: Go early in the morning (It gets really really crowded after 9:00 AM on weekends)"
,,whoa,5.0,,"Despite the crowds and the cramped up feeling, this center has EVERYTHING, and at ok prices. Not only that, each section is extremely thorough - with the largest men's clothing section I have ever seen and a few aisles for coffee. This is a 24 hour shopping center, so we did some last minute shopping before our flight around midnight, which was great (got all my last minute gifts for family here...)"
,,All in one,5.0,,"Perfect place to get almost anything you need, be it grocery, electronics, medicare, cosmetics, utensils, apparels or home furnishing. The best thing about this place is that you get lot of variety in items, especially vegetables and groceries."
,,Kebabs 'n Curries has great food,4.0,,"Exhausted from walking through the vast Mustafa Centre, we saw a sign advertising their restaurant on the 7th floor, so we went there for lunch. We shared a starter and two main courses: one lamb, one chicken. The lamb dish was superb. Next we tried the chicken dish we had ordered, only to find another lamb dish -- the waiter (who wrote nothing down) had muddled our order. Too tired to complain, we ate the second lamb dish. It was the greatest Indian food I have ever eaten. Clearly, our waiter knew what we wanted better than we did!"
,,“One of the best shopping experience”,5.0,,"It’s the best place to go if you’re after a bargain or enjoy shopping late into the twilight hours. Spread in many buildings across the roads, Mustafa may not be as fancy as some of Singapore’s other malls, but it has a great range of items, and good prices to match."
,,Get accused of stealing!,1.0,,"Don't even bother! You come in here for the first time through entrances where there's no bag checking and the first thing they take you for is a thief! I wasn't told of that matter to get my bag secured or stored outside before entering. Wasted my time getting arrested by a disgusting One-eyed security guy who acted as a civilian the whole time so he could stalk me throughout my shopping experience. He initiated physical contact on me before the exit of the store, i was shocked at first, tried to talk some sense into his head but his level of understanding of words is as absent as his missing left eye. The quality of the items there aren't genuine or good! The salespersons there were sloppy and reluctant in service as well. End of the day they could'n prove anything of me and had to released me due to their false accusations, and they did not even have the due respect to apologize!!!"
,,Horrible,1.0,,This is the worst shopping centre I have ever been to. It is cram packed full of junk and people shopping. The dollar store is a hundred times better than this place. I would never go back.
,,Problem of Too Much to Choose From,3.0,,"They say - Mustafa Centre is a shopping place in Singapore where you can get anything... well almost anything. And this is true. We went there two times. First visit was just to get acquainted and second was to shop a few things :)
The place is crowded since it is a value-for-money mall. If you are interested in luxury goods then Orchard Road or Vivo City (covered in a separate review) are the places!
Here the range of things that you can see is vast. It covers probably all types of items that you need in your daily life from furniture, white goods to bags, electronics to chocolates and vegetables. Every type of items has a separate section dedicated.
Our overall experience was still average because the place is cramped and crowded and is filled with so many brands and so many numbers that you become indecisive.
We wanted to buy some electronics but the problem of many deterred us from buying anything. Finally, all we could buy were t-shirts, as souvenirs, many of them, of many colours and designs and themes and sizes to many of our friends and relatives!"
,,Felt prejudiced against,1.0,,This is a review of the huge jewelry centre. We were made to feel that we did not deserve attention because our skin color was unlike theirs.
,,Not visiting Again,1.0,,worst place to go for shopping....more worse is i got my toe cut at outside the mall as they have sharp metal piece....kept unprotected. i had to pay good amount of dollar to get first aid. the area is filthy and not tourist friendly.
,,Avoid unless your are desparate or destitute!!,2.0,,"Crowded and smelly ! Horrible service , things arranged and piled up haphazardly all over. Not worth the hassle. Getting a taxi out of this area is another adventure ! Avoid unless you are mentally prepared to be tortured."
,,Buy rare snacks here,3.0,,"If you want to buy ""rare"" snacks or chocolate with a little cheaper price-not very cheap though just a little cheaper from other place- visit Mustafa Centre. If you want to buy souvenirs, go to other places, here is much expensive.

I just went there to buy Singapore Milo Australian Recipe, 1,25 kg. Very worth it, when I came home it was only last for like a week"
,,Do Not Visit,2.0,,"Expected much more from this centre. It had everything but nothing I wanted. Its lighting is terrible, and the environment is even worse. Do not visit unless you are passing by and saw the centre, then just walk in for a glance. Do not expect to buy anything."
,,Mustafa Shopping Centre,4.0,,"Also called Serangoon Plaza and located on Serangoon Road..
Surprise, can visit in night .. 24 HOURs shopping mall right in the heart of Little India.. Everything ... Food, Electrical, electronic, toys etc etc .. Gold is cheaper. On gold chains, they dont charge any making cost. Otherwise also making is less... Many Money changers in the mall itself..
Many Indian food option near by.

Note :- Bring your passport to get your bill endorsed for GST refund close to 7%."
,,Serious shopping,4.0,,"If you really want to do serious shopping, this is it. I haven't been to anything like this. From U.S. Traders' Joe products like quinoa and nuts, to Bangladeshi textile, it's here. My next trip to Singapore is only for this - to shop organic food stuff. And remember, there's tax rebate for any purchase from here."
,,One stop shopping,4.0,,"It is a huge department store who sell many kind of things, you can found anything inside the building, and for sure the price are relatively cheap, especially for parfumes, and for the most interesting thing it open for 24 hours, so don't worry to find stuff if you are in late night, you could walk here from Ferrer Park MRT Station or Little India MRT Station just about 5 minutes to walk. Very great one stop shopping concept."
,,Shop til U Drop!,4.0,,"We had no choice but to visit on a Saturday afternoon as we are enplaning back home the next day. We were armed and ready in expecting a huge crowd but to our amazement, the crowd was thick yet manageable. There is a wide mix of merchandise from food, appparel, textile, houseware. It is also very accessible as it is just across exit H of Farrer Park MRT Station. Getting a taxi out of Mustafa Center may be a bit of a challenge so best to leave prior to rush hours."
,,An Experience To Remember!,3.0,,"Our hotel recommended that we go to Mustafa in Little India area, it's a ""one shop"" selling watches, luggage, dvds, perfumes, chocolates etc..... the place was crowded with families, children, and tourist. Mustafa sells all kinds of things...which are fairly cheap! Beware it takes longer to pay for your purchases than it does to shop through out the store.

It is an experience....it's a place you go once!"
,,Just Huge,4.0,,"This place is amazing. You can buy virtually anything, I kid you not. We go there to purchase our groceries (fresh veg and meats). We also go there to purchase our electricals. In fact we go there to purchase cosmetics. We've even eaten there! The place is immense, every foot of space is packed with goods of one kind or another. However, do not go there during weekends or holidays. Way too many people makes things very difficult. As this is a 24 hour shop there are plenty of other times to go. We have been at various times and the fresh produce is always fresh."
,,Cheap perfumes,3.0,,"Its my 2nd time here. from my previous experience, this is a must visit place if u are one of the perfumes lovers. They sell original perfumes at a very cheap price. we bought almost 10 bottles! its good that this place is open 24hours. not just perfumes, they sell everything under one roof. to get there, take MRT to Farrer Park and just walk less than 5 minutes."
,,Really 24 hrs Shopping!,3.0,,"Trust me the word ""huge"" will not be enough for making you understand how big it is. It's massive. The products available are good you will get all your needs in one place. Here we come to the bad things 1st- no staffs are there to assist you.
2nd- you will notice poorly mainated products some are broken some are out of the box. This purely happens because of no staff availability."
,,Mustafa Centre is a mustafa see!,5.0,,"This was the highlight of my time in Little India.

Soooo good that it deserves its own review.

It's a must see, must do and is on a side-road (Syed Alwi Road) off Serangoon Road which is the main road in Little India.
It is not as fancy as some of Singapore’s other malls but it IS truly amazing. I have NEVER seen anything like it.
It is said to sell over 300,000 items and I can believe it!!
There were a lot of Indian shoppers when I was there but many expats/travelers as well.
Clothes, electronics, books, music, dvd’s, phones, perfume, souvenirs, makeup and it has its own supermarket with a BIG BIG range of food and groceries.
From the bottom to the top floor there's an enormous range of items, and from what I saw what seem like pretty good prices as well.
I was just totally amazed by the number and volume of products that can be stuffed into this place AND it’s open 24-hours.
Honestly it's one of those ""have to see to believe"" experiences.
Set aside a couple of hours for this Mall alone if you want to have a really good look around.
Also there is a newer addition to the Mustafa Centre, just across a side road and I did venture to the roof top of that new building where there is a relatively new restaurant and got some great pictures of the local area from up high."
,,Mustafa center the place that never sleeps,4.0,,"This must be the one place where Indians would love to flock, for their shopping needs in Singapore. This is a 24 hour mult building multi storeyed departmental store located near Little India on Serangoon Road. You will find almost everything that you would think of buying as a tourist. However, I realized that they are not competitve on prices, compared to India. Electronics, the variety is good but costlier than India. For other stuff such as chocolates, Japanese sarees, clothes and shoes for children, etc..this is a good place where you will find stuff reasonably priced. I bought a Fujifilm camera, which turned out to be 4-5K more expensive than India. However, with some bargaining, I got a few accessories such as 'tripod' free. Also one important thing to mention, if you are a tourist you can get the GST refunded. There is a GST refund counter which helps you for every shopping worth more than 100$. The refund gets credited to you when you are departing from Singapore at the Airport customs. The process is pretty hassle free."
,,Shoppers paradise !,5.0,,If u want to do shopping then this is the one place for everything under the sun. Although its jam packed with customers in its little aisles but this huge store takes up nearly 3-4 hours easily!! If u really dont have time to go to all the different shopping places or are averse to spending huge amounts then this is the place. Reasonable n evrything under one roof :)
,,Perfect place for everything,5.0,,There is a whole floor of electronic goods which are having cheap prices. Jewelries are very cheap. There are many vegetarian shop near this center. Travelling bags prices are unbelievable.
,,Great Mall with A to Z available for shopping,5.0,,"People who stay in ""The Park Royal"" - Kitchener Road will be more happy as this mall is only few steps away. Many people who stay in the outskirts of Singapore visit Mustafa to do shopping.

It is only because the products are Original. You can get anything and everything from here without wanting to go somewhere else for doing the shopping.

You need one full day completely to be spent here for shopping."
,,Nice place to shop,4.0,,"It is nice place to shop souvenirs and gifts like chocolate , perfumes for self and the family. It is reasonable priced and at time cheaper then the duty free too."
,,They got everything for you!,5.0,,"This shopping mall is excellent when it comes to the availability and variety of products from clothes, food,jewelries, toys, cheap chocolates, groceries, sports & adventure items , supplements, beauty products, healthcare and electronic devices etc.. are all here.Opens 24/7."
,,Perfect bargain spot for cheap consumables under one roof,4.0,,"Everything from jewellery to souvenir keyrings, from suitcases to vegetables, from furniture to electronics, from garments to currency exchange - everything under one brand, prices lower than anywhere else, open 24 X 7, this is one of its kind.
But it's not as regularised as some of the fellow reviewers aptly said. The money exchanger makes no entry, asks no identity when exchanging huge amounts of cash. The jewellery shop has no standardization either."
,,Buy everything from pin to plane!!,5.0,,"There are about 500 people in this 4 story shopping mall that has almost everything one needs to build a house. We spent atleast 2-3 days, 6 hours each shopping here. Its an amazing place and an absolute must go-to place when visiting S'pore."
,,Mad House for shopping... good for quantity lover not quality lover!!,3.0,,"It’s a huge mall………… in my opinion it’s for people who believe in quantity and not quality.
It had everything from house hold stuff to daily needs to fashion and accessories, souvenirs, electronics and on and on… you name it and I am sure you will find it. Its low on price."
,,Its hussle and bussle but worth a visit,4.0,,"We went there a couple of months ago and found the service good but not great as you had to wait in a long line to pay for your goods, We didn't realise that you could pay for all collected items on another floor, lesson learned. You name they have it , some goods are cheap and nasty, others of good quality and inexpensive. If you are into gold this place is a Mecca , my wife got more excited about this place than I seeing she is Ms shopping and I am Mr. paying.
Overall a nice place to shop as long as you do not mind being forced to mingle with a large crowd."
,,Gold Jewellery at Mustafa,2.0,,"Although Mustafa has an impressive jewellery show plaza, I always wondered why Mustafa is neither a Member of Singapore Assay Organisation, the Quality Certifiers nor the Singapore Jewellers Association, the Pricing Agency. Do they solely rely on the gulliable Indian Tourists ? I would advise buyers to exercise due caution while buying gold jewellery at Mustafa"
,,Good prices and 24 hours,4.0,,"Don't know what to do after all the malls closed and in need of more retail therapy? Mustafa is here to your rescue!

This place carries EVERYTHING and opens 24 hours. Amazing place. But it can get very crowded and feels unsafe. So be extra careful when you visit.

This place doesn't feel like Singapore...I must say...things here are messy but cheap."
,,"Just a ""supermarket""",3.0,,"This mall is located near little India and personally, it's just another 24hrs supermarket but sells everything. Good place if you may need anything in the middle of the night."
,,24 Hours Shopping,4.0,,"Nice place to shop...unending variety ...gold,electronics,clothes,shoes,toys....everything...with a big range of selection that too 24 hrs"
,,What a place!,5.0,,"A huge building where everything under the sun is available on sale,except prob'ly human beings!!!! Friendly staff & well-stocked shelves."
,,A Worthwhile Experience If You Know What to Expect,4.0,,"The Mustafa Centre is bustling (crowded), huge, and full of just about anything you want to buy in floors and floors of building. It's a short walk from the Farrer Park station on the MRT Purple Line. Inside, it's easy to get lost or trapped But if you know what you're getting into, you can buy your coffee, tea, spices, and souvenirs, experience the hustle and bustle, and then leave.

Worth the experience, for however long you want."
,,Shoppers Palace,5.0,,The best place to go for shopping in Singapore where you'll get every stuffs at a cheap price with excellent quality.
,,Busy and hot,3.0,,"I didn't get why people rave over the Mustafa Centre. It was busy (as expected) but hot and slightly moist on all floors. We couldn't find the rooftop restaurant at all. While the floors seem logical they are too packed and we soon left to have dinner at a nearby restaurant. The gold market round the front was fun but we bought nothing as all we liked was made in Turkey and, having lived there, I'd prefer to buy from the locals in Turkey next time."
,,Fun place to shop,5.0,,Great range from souvenirs and electrical things on the ground floor to clothes and food as you go up.
,,24hr Shopping Under One Roof,4.0,,"Nice place to visit for shopping for everything you need for your home. Good offers on chocolates, food items, groceries, etc. One stop shop for household items, appliances, clothes, jewellery, money changers, perfumes - just about everything. Suggestion - kindly avoid on Fridays - Over Crowded with workers/immigrants ! Look out for bargain deals and probably the best money exchange rates in Singapore."
,,Open 24x7x365,4.0,,Well Mustafa Center is open always...puts the entire shopping experience at one place...with currency exchange and good restaurants nearby...its a crowded affair anytime of the day.
,,Convenient,4.0,,I was here today to do some spices shopping and realised there was a wide range of indian spices with choice of brand and to me that was good and the price wete reasonable and at times could be cheaper than some outlets at little india.If you have time and love to stroll around these is the place.Morexeasier late night as they are open 24hrs which is a big advantage for me.High recommend.
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"This has everything and anything in Singapore and the prices seem a bit cheaper than other malls. The perfume deals are amazing! Much cheaper and so many buy one get one free offers for good perfumes. Try to go before 6.00pm as afterwards the shopping center itself and the surrounding roads gets congested with people.

The tax refund forms formalities are done on Basement 2."
,,Anytime shopping,3.0,,Have visited this compound for 2-3 hours which was not enough to cover the different sections.almost everything is there but badly displayed .the prices are reasonable compared to Singapore prices
,,Mustafa Centre,4.0,,"Budget shopaholic must go here. everything i want is available here. a bit too crowded, maybe because too much shelves and items. the price is not too cheap or not too expensive, just...reasonable? just fair for me.
the staff are not too friendly, but since i just shopping, after pass the cashier, vice versa, no hard feeling.
not too cozy as no chair or bench available. after 2 hours of shopping, its hard for an old person like my parents.
surrounded by mostly indian restaurants, its still on Little India complex after all, but still nearer to Farrer Park mrt station than to Little India mrt."
,,Nothing Much,3.0,,"Ok place to get some groceries etc for a reasonable price. too big and too expensive as well. staff are not friendly at all and that need a lesson or two in being nice and polite to people. perfume deals are worth,"
,,A must for the shopping addict,5.0,,"This was my first visit to the Mustafa Centre in Little India, but it will not be my last. You get the feeling that if you are unable to find what you are looking for in the centre then it probably is not made.
Be aware that any bags you are carrying when you arrive will be sealed and all purchases are placed in plastic bags which are also then sealed. I have never seen such a enormous array of electronic equipment or at the other end of the spectrum, gold jewellery. Leave your credit card at home or have a low limit on it unless you are very strong willed.
Staff can be off hand and dismissive, but don't let this put you off a wonderful shopping or at least, browsing experience."
,,Patchwork & Fabric- Quality vs quantity,4.0,,"Mustafa Center sells many things however it can get really crowded sometimes especially during the weekends, which can be rather inconvenient when you have children with you. If you are looking for patchwork, fabric, sewing products, grocery, home appliances, basic necessities and is someone who prefers to shop with ease, looking for quality patchwork fabric and other sewing products, you can check out The Grandstand which is easily accessible by FREE shuttle bus services from Clementi, Botanic Gardens, Toa Payoh MRT stations & Bukit Timah Road. Definitely less crowded than Mustafa especially if you are going on a weekend. There is a craft shop on the 4th floor called San Merinos which sell a range of handicraft things such as buttons, ribbons, clover products, japanese fabric, lovely laces, sewing products, craftbooks, wool etc. The staff there is very friendly and helpful too. If you want to buy groceries and home products, there is Giant Hypermarket and Pasar Bella on the groundfloor. Lots as interesting cafes and restaurants around if you want to chill. A wonderful alternative to Mustafa especially if you are looking for a more relaxing, comfortable and child-friendly place."
,,shop till you die..!!,4.0,,"Be ready for a marathon and some leg ache..this shopping centre accommodates everything from food, clothes, cosmetics, electronics etc..
One of the best places to shop post midnight (24X7 open).. Suggest enter post 12am to avoid rush and queue at billing counter.. Indian will find the indian food here..I could not visit entire place as got scanning through perfumes, electronics & clothes.. Must visit in case you are a shopping lover"
,,Complete and affordable shopping place in Singapore,4.0,,"Located in Little India area, the Mustafa Center is a must to go in Singapore if you want to look for your every day needs at most affordable price. Except for its shabby look of the building and not too well maintained, but finding almost all your daily need at cheaper prices would take away all this constrains.
But they need to have a more courteous greeter and more friendlier staffs attending the customer at this center."
,,a Nice ThreadMill Excercise,5.0,,"the Public Restrooms are stinky.
a Nice ThreadMill Excercise that can make your ankles sore.
carrying backpack or any bags from shopping outside the Mustafa Centre would make You to be called off to tie up the zipper. That would be barring you from shoplifting there..."
,,The place for 24 hours shopping,3.0,,"I think Mustafa Center is one of the place the bargain hunters can shop in Singapore. Its prices are less than most of the other places . Since it is open 24 hours the visitors can go at any time convenient to them and shop. Most of the tourists go there for shopping on there way to the airport.
We can buy anything there such as cloths, shoes, Jewellery, stationary, books, wrist watches, phones, electric items, kitchen ware, groceries, what ever you name it.

Not only shopping there is a money changer too where you get a reasonable price. They also do tour operations.
It is situated in Little india. so most of the Asians are used to visit here.
Since it is very closer to Farrar Park MRT, it is easy to access by train. However there are lot of busses which you can access Mustafa Centre."
,,Shopping,4.0,,You can buy anything and everything here. There are lot of things for a low-cost shopping. But some items are really cheap and low quality. If you wanna buy Chocolates and good food it's good.
,,Good Shopping Place - not Wow,3.0,,"For those who plan to travel between KL and Singapore - you get the GST exemption only if you take a flight out of Singapore, not if you are using the train to commute between KL and Singapore. A shame for shoppers (like me) who were lured in part by the GST exemption.

You get everything in one place. Depending on where you are traveling from, you may find the options exciting/interesting or not.

Nothing too great for tourists traveling from India - you may pick up some electronic items not yet launched in India. But not much of a cost differential."
,,Twenty-four hour bargain hunting,4.0,,"More popular among people from Indian Sub-continent. Mustafa Centre is set in the Little India district. It’s the best place to go if you’re after a bargain or enjoy shopping late into the twilight hours. Spread in many buildings across the roads, Mustafa may not be as fancy as some of Singapore’s other malls, but it has a great range of items, and good prices to match. Here, you’ll get a bargain on just about everything, from clothes, perfume, souvenirs, electronics, jewellery, makeup, confectionery and even food and groceries. There is also a large selection of Indian apparel and accessories available here, which is not surprising, considering its location. Offering even travel, hotel reservation and visa assistance services, Mustafa Centre is a shopping experience unlike any other that shouldn’t be missed."
,,Why Don't I Come Here More Often,5.0,,"Not for you if you're claustrophobic, but if you want a wide selection, plus sizes and cheap, this place is for you. It's one of those places where tourists and locals mix. I love it!"
,,beware mustafa,5.0,,"only be careful in purchasing electronic goods and tv.do,nt be fooled by mustafa. go to orchard road where u will get good and honest people."
,,mustfa a cheat be careful,2.0,,"I purchased a tv model no kdl42 674A for 915$ on 23/08/2013and brought it to chennai.at the time of purchase they told that international warrenty was inside and i belived. but nothing was found in side on arrival the tv hardly worked for 3 months. here at chennai nobody was willing to repair without warrenty.
several phone calls were made but they did not reply in proper manner and refused to replace the same . it worked only for 3 months.
these people spoil the integrity of singapore. however iam trying to contact the external ministry of singapore to seek redressal.

,,A large but rather stale shopping mall...,3.0,,"I had heard a lot about the Mustafa Centre so I made it a point to visit the place only to be disappointed… Well, the place is huge and there are wide varieties of stuff available in the store… practically everything you would need. But, there are lots of junk also and what put me off more is that the stuffs are not kept in an organised manner… particularly I found the electronics section very clumsy and most of the electronics is of substandard quality. And no, things are also not cheap here either… at least the branded ones. The gold section is huge but I didn’t see anyone buying anything…

It’s not a typical swanky shopping mall… As a tourist there is nothing in this place that you won’t find in a regular shopping mall or shopping centre… no special price either. I fail to understand why so many people talk about this place? I agree with so many varieties of stuff available under one roof it might be a very useful place for the locals but as a tourist I didn’t see any value in it. If you are visiting Little India you may still drop in at Mustafa for few minutes just for the sake of it."
,,Amazing Experience!!,4.0,,"A must visit in singapore for the tourists. It isa 24 hours open huge shopping centre with each and every item. Grocery to Baggage to sport to perfumes, you name and you have in mustafa for a reasonable price. Avoid Sat and Sun rush."
,,Mustafa is my favorite shop in the world,5.0,,"I live is Europe, working as a flight attendant, so everytime I come to Singapore I spent many hours at Mustafa, once 8 hours....it is definitely my favorite shop in the world.
Here I find everything I need to live ! The food department has a great choice.
The cloth department caters nice indian fashion, household articles, stationary and dvd's, jewellery and make up, toiletteries, tablecloth, decoration material, everything you wish !
It is often hard to find a taxi when leaving Mustafa, but the MTR station is close by aswell a a bus stop. There are a lot a good restaurants in front of Mustafa.
I strongly recommend this shop for everyone who like the Middle East, Indian, Asian flair !"
,,A Place for cheap and Souvenir!!,4.0,,"Located not far from Ferrer Park MRT station; Next to Kitchener Street; These place is a giant shopping complex. An electric goods - non duty free parfume - confectionary - SG logo t-shirt and clothes - Medicine - SG chocolate or a crytal merlion figure.
All in all everything you need with cheap goods can find here."
,,24 hours mega maal,4.0,,"Mustafa centre is a 24 hours mega maal in the heart of Singapore which is situated in Little india and with in stone throwing distance of quay area. it has almost all the merchandise which one can imagine. it is very popular among indians for electronics, jewellary and indian packaged food. one can get best rates for money exchange."
,,Non-stop shopping,3.0,,"Mustafa is open 24 hours and houses several floors of merchandise. Best bargain buys can be found here for perfume, chocolate and gold jewelry. It's an iconic location in Little India and can be visited at any time. I was able to buy a universal adapter for just 7.50 SGD, which isn't a bad price considering it can be pricier in other places. The facility is a little dated, though, so don't expect high end designs. This is pretty much like your US Walmart, only larger. And selling gold."
,,Fantastic shopping centre!!,5.0,,"You really can buy anything here and it's open 24 hours!!! Loads of restaurants outside which are also open very late. It's located in Little India and is very busy, if you're looking for a peaceful and spacious shop then I would advise looking elsewhere. A thick layer of skin for pushing through oblivious crowds is necessary. Avoid at peak times!! Also beware of the count of people inside on the TV outside, if it exceeded a certain number, the TV turns red and don't go in!!!"
,,Its over estimated supermarket,3.0,,"Its based near Little India , where majority of Indian population lives ... so if you are looking for India brands - Its best place to be but walking space inside is very small .. They are trying to sell anything and everthing.. Mean Gold to Grocery... Avoid weekends too crowed and avoid road side food for better health. .... Cheers !"
,,"""Olde Worlde Charm""",4.0,,"THe Mustafa Centre is a must see if you are in or near Little India. Appearing a little dated now, this is a fascinating example of one of the first ""shopping malls"" in Singapore and the range of exciting and intriguing things to look at and to buy is amazing and overwhelming all at the same time. It is multi leveled, stacked to the rafters and a visual and sensory experience to remember and savour. It's old, it's quaint,it stays open late and it can be packed - but - it's a safe shopping experience - and fun !!! Be adventurous - shop where the locals and the tourists shop . . . go on !"
,,24hr shopping....,4.0,,"Its one of the place where I have experienced 24hrs shopping. Good place to purchase electronic goods like TV, Handy-cam, Digi-Cam, ..... . My experience has been very good with the purchase there. You also get very good Indian and Singaporean food around this Mall."
,,Tons of stuff.,4.0,,"During an 18 hour layover in Singapore, my friend and I decided to make the most of our short stay and venture out to Little India. We got to Mustafa around 8PM and decided to do some shopping, mainly looking for some clothes. There were a lot of people standing around the streets just hanging out - majority of them men. It did make me feel a little uncomfortable.

There were TONS of different things on sale and tons of people late into the night shopping. The clothing section was located a floor below the entrance we used. Although the racks were stuffed with clothes, they did not carry any American style clothing that I prefer. I did however walk out of there with a wall outlet converter, baby wipes, toothpaste, and a few other random things that I didn't know I needed.

Overall it was interesting experience. I don't think I would return if I ever came back to Singapore though."
,,What a large shop!,4.0,,"Open 24 hours. They sell everything! Gold, electronics, food, cosmetic and so on. Stroll around in this shop in Little India. Carrefour has less choice than this one."
,,Wow.. abundant items... very complete...,4.0,,"To see so many items there, it takes at least 3 - 5 hours... Various chocolate Various whole grain, bean Various soaps.... Your money would be spent a lot.. hahaha Etc"
,,Shopping... Shopping... Shopping,5.0,,"We went there in a very first hour of our hotel check in, It was our first time in Singapore but as it was at the walking distance from our hotel and thats why we decided to roam around. This is a shopping paradise. You find almost everything from here. We shop many things, and we are still missing it. Must go and shop."
,,Something Different in the way of shopping ?,4.0,,"maybe not to everyone's taste but the Mustafa Centre is different ! catch a cab or walk and take in the other attractions of the ""Little India"" precinct, Excellent money changer at the front of the Centre, normally best rates in Singapore, the Centre holds most of everything you will want to buy in Singapore, look around, no one hassles you, good prices for ""gold"" jewellery with a mulititude of choice, watches of every type and styles all good manufacturers and great prices, clothes? will suit every taste, even groceries and medical supplies, this ""shop"" has everything but be prepared to spend a couple of hours there to explore every part, when you are tired catch a cab back to your hotel"
,,24 hours Supermarket,4.0,,"Souvenirs, perfumes, shirt, watch, everything in affordable price. For souvenirs if you want to buy lot of, go to bugis street. but if you didn't want to buy many souvenirs, mustafa provides many kinds of souvenirs with affordable price. Good deal"
,,Good collection of all items! Bad service,4.0,,"U will get everything and anything under one roof! Although this is basically a indian shop , you will still find what u need! On the downside, the staff specially in the electronic and jewellry section is terrible! No manners! Bad attitude!"
,,No!,1.0,,"Please listen to my warning... No!! If you are a Westerner do not go there! Yes it has Bollywood DVDs... Yes, it does have strange foods you haven't seen before.. But don't do it! If the smell isn't enough to make you sick maybe the fact there's no toilet paper in the bathrooms will? That's right, just 'public' bidets. If you're lucky you may find a toilet tissue dispenser where you can 'purchase' toilet paper!..
Oh, Let's not forget the terrible customer service, or lack there of. Every person working there are on there mobiles, one guy was watching a movie on his. The people on the registers are worse. Don't expect them to acknowledge you in any way other than to tell you the price of your purchase. The whole place was very depressing, I feel sorry for these people.

If you're not convinced just know that the Taxi drivers refused to take my fair when I wanted to leave. Consider yourself warned!!"
,,They have everything!,4.0,,"They have everything here! Just be aware that some stuff such as t-shirts and souvenirs can be found cheaper in the nearby Kampong Glam shops.
There's a great rewtaurant serving Indian food nearby called Marjat that's open for 24 hours. Try their Nasi Goreng or Maggi Goreng with Ikan zbilis. Delicious!"
,,24h open!,4.0,,"My favourite place for shopping in Singapore.Sometimes very crowded but you can find there EVERYTHING at a good price from food and spices to jewelery and medicines.The exchange desks outside give good rates. Not luxury but good fun seeing different people living their real lives. If you buy refundable goods, bring your passport."
,,Everything you need in one place,4.0,,"My husband and I went here to buy things to bring back home as ""pasalubong"" like choocolates and perfumes. There are varieties of cheap products you can choose from. You should go here during weekdays since its not too crowded."
,,Non-repairable mobile phone,1.0,,"I bought a new Samsung smart phone at Mustafa Centre. They told me they didn't offer a warranty, which I understood to mean they would not deal with any future warranty needs, but that Samsung would. No problem, as I don't live in Singapore, but in Indonesia. They failed to tell me the phone was not built for Singapore or even Asia, but for the UAE, meaning it can not be repaired here in Asia. So 5 months after purchase, the motherboard completely died for no apparent reason and now I'm stuck with a dead, useless phone. I'd advise buying a phone elsewhere, and confirming it's built or compatible in the region you intend to use it in."
,,Goods Not Upto the Mark,3.0,,"There are many Departments in the Mall but Conjusted. Over crowed on SUNDAY...looks like the Mall is Distributed Fee Stuffs. On Sunday, outside of Mall security seems to be Low in Numbers."
,,"Spend $4,000 on jewelry, no one even says ""thank you""",4.0,,"The staff are just rude here, very poorly trained. Over 2 days, I made maybe 10 different purchases, and not one sales person or cashier showed any appreciation to a customer. No one will say ""thank you"". They just don't care. Prices aren't really that great, just good, but the selection is amazing, and I love that they are always open. During Chinese new year when everything else in Singapore was closed, they are WIDE OPEN for business.

The 22k gold jewelry selection is amazing. You don't have to worry here about getting cheated... it's always going to be a fair price, but it's nearly impossible to try anything out, like electronics for headphones especially. You either buy it or you don't. If you don't, they have 20,000 other customers in the store at the same time, so they don't need you.

If you want to get the 7.5% GST sales tax back at the airport, foreigners MUST bring their passport. Copies not accepted.

There are 3 buildings, and it's very difficult to navigate as there is no map, and only the most basic signage. The main larger store is the one with the entrances iin green and white, labeled from 1 to 5. If you go in the other building, it's the smaller store, and has smaller selections in most areas.

Lots of Indian restaurants outside, the one we tried was excellent and clean.

Nearly impossible to get a taxi around here, but there is a taxi line on the large road called Serangoon Road, just in front of the Mustafa store entrance on that street, which is the smaller store. Taxis won't pick up anywhere else except that taxi line. The closest MRT subway station is Ferrar Road, across Serangoon Rood, maybe 4 minutes walk.

Be warned a lot of the warranties for products sold here are only valid in certain countries. Like it might say ""warranty valid in China and India only"".

I still give it a ""very good"" rating, just based on selection and hours open. Great place to escape the heat in Singapore, day or night."
,,Mustafa Centre or Mob Centre,4.0,,"It is a shopping centre not missed by tourists to Singapore. It is a spacious shopping centre, spread over a vast area with many floors having different items like groceries, food items, chocolates, toiletries, house hold items, electronic goods, bags, textiles,home furnishings,fruits&vegetables, fresh & frozen non-vegetarian items, gold jewellery etc. The list goes on and is never ending & one need not visit any other shop. The rates are moderate. The arrangement of goods is clumsy and cramped & during rush hour it is vey difficult to move about, specially for the aged,women&children. The staff are insufficient & they hardly assist you & often they are seen chit chatting among themselves,rather than assisting the customers. One has to help himself & billing is a big problem due to few billing counters & large queues. It is better to avoid visiting the shop on holidays & in the evenings, unless you have a great patience. Better to have a list of items to be purchased and finish of early. There are a lot of eateries around the centre to hang around with family & friends. South Indians with knowledge of Tamil will have a good rapport with the salesmen in the shopping centre. There is also a money changer shop in the ground floor, to cater to the travellers. Even though it is a shopping centre for the whole family, the large crowds visiting it daily and the cramped atmosphere mars ones enjoyment of shopping. It is worth taking a risk, if you don't want to miss it."
,,whoah!,3.0,,"Went there to buy chocolates on night, around 10.30 PM, so it wasn't too crowded but still a lot of people coming there. They do have SO MANY stuff to buy: food, clothes, accessories, etc., etc., etc. Whoah, crazy choices! Though the buildings are big, but because of the stuffsssssss (yes, with lots of 's'), the place seems to be too crowded.

For me personally, this place is not special, but quite interesting because of the product choices it offers. I found some of the prices are cheaper than in other places. And it opens 24/7! Another 'whoah' for this shopping centre! So no problem to put it at the very bottom of your daily schedule trip in Singapore, just beware to notice the public transportation operation hour so you can still take MRT or bus to go back to your hotel.

Best time to come: definitely in the night."
,,The fun of it all,4.0,,Mustafa is many things to many people and always on my shopping adventure list as I travel to Singapore regularly. I have set things I buy n also satisfy my shoe fetish at dirt cheap prices which makes hubbie happy. Get over the cultural cringe and enjoy the fun of the crush ... If don't like crush don't go Sunday afternoons or go at midnight ... They are open!
,,Quite Big but not great,2.0,,"This huge 24 hour open multi-storied shop (not a mall) is situated in a dirty place (compared to other areas of SIngapore e.g. Central Mall) in Little India. We went on Monday noon and it was not much crowded.
Every sort of things are available here. The exchange rate is better than what is offered at Airport. The prices are not that cheap as compare to Australia. So, we only bought souvenirs from here.
We had lunch at the rooftop restaurant. The food was good but the utensils were not clean.
Getting a taxi was headache. We had to walk for 5 minutes to a get a taxi to our hotel.

Overall, I do not count this place as worthy of visit except for souvenirs/exchange."
,,Great Shopping - Weekends Too Busy,4.0,,"This is a great shop but if you go on Friday night or over the weekend, it is extremely busy and trying to get a taxi can take around an hour and also lines are long at the cash register. If you have an option it is better to go during the week. The shop has good prices and a lot of stock and is also good for those wanting to buy gold or exchange money."
,,HEAVEN,4.0,,"heaven for shopping, esp u guys for looking some chocolates. XD i spent 2 hours here and didnt get bored. i bet u 90% this place is more cheaper than other place in singapore."
,,24 hour shopping,4.0,,From one tiny store this has now become a large shopping complex found in Little India. Open 24 hours so go anytime. Full of everything you can want from shopping to eating or just browsing around. Went on a Saturday and it was heaving with people. Going on a week day probably better
,,I love Mustafa Centre,5.0,,"I absolutely love Mustafa Centre. What's there not to love? It's opened 24 hours a day and you can find almost everything under the sun except pork, tobacco and alcohol. They sell gold, electronics, household products, groceries, clothes, perfume, car accessories, the list goes on and on.

My advice is to visit Mustafa in the day or late at night (after 11pm). It gets crowded at night and it isn't pleasant. There are plenty of authentic Indian restaurants to dine at opposite the mall too."
,,Great variety in a wax museum,3.0,,"If you are looking for a one stop shopping centre, this is it! Mustafa has everything and more - widest selection of brands for every imaginable merchandise.

Do be mindful that almost all staff are old, unmotivated, stone faced, slow and speak little English. Lol

A word of caution - visiting on weekdays is strongly recommended. Over the weekends, 200-300k manual workers from South Asia will throng the vicinity.

Enjoy the experience! Nothing like it anywhere!!"
,,Shopping in Singapore,4.0,,Mustafa is the place to shop. I guess you may get everything in the world. I bought a watch for my wife and son and a few deos for gifting. Great place to be in . Singapore visit means going to Mustafa.
,,Huge collection,4.0,,Mustafa is the one of the best stores. You get everything over there. Its a huge collection of items. For a tourist point of view it has money changer also. A lot of eating place around.
,,Not exactly a Cheap paradise,3.0,,"I have been shopping all over South East Asia, and one should note that SIngapore is not cheap by any means. The prices are not the best in this country, and if travelling to KL or Thailand, please do your electronic shopping there.

Please note about this place, the service isn't great, however, they never harass you if you don't want to buy anything after looking at a few items. it's packed like sardines. Best if you know exactly what you are after as the staff are not there to push sales to you.

The place was absolutely crowded upon my visit at 1am. The sales people didn't all seem happy to be there, and in some areas things were very much out of place like they sell random stuff and the overall atmosphere is dirty/cheap. But it seems they have everything under the sun in that 24 hour shop. The prices are good for singapore It could get a little confusing since there are at least 4 different entrances/exits. Although it was a bit chaotic, I'd recommend it for the experience."
,,Interesting shopping experience,3.0,,"The place was absolutely crowded. The sales people didn't all seem happy to be there, and in some areas things were very much out of place. But it seems they have everything under the sun in that mall. The prices are good and there's quite a variety of food items -which is why we went there. It could get a little confusing since there are at least 4 different entrances. Although it was a bit chaotic, I'd recommend it."
,,Great place to shop if you don't want to be ripped off,5.0,,"I have been shopping here for over 20 years every time I come to Singapore, and though the service isn't great, they never harass you if you don't want to buy anything after looking at a few items. It's a no-frills shopping paradise. Best to avoid the weekends or after 6pm as the crowd resembles more of a bustling market and it's packed like sardines. Best if you know exactly what you are after as the staff are not there to push sales to you. If you prefer great service but don't mind paying 10-30% more, there are plenty of flashy malls around. There's a GST counter downstairs but you will need your passport with you to claim the 7% back. I find the best items to buy are perfumes and watches, not clothes. Not sure about gold or other jewellery as I have never bought them from here."
,,Terrible,1.0,,"Visited December 2012, unfortunately we did not find this place as per the comments on trip advisor in fact totally opposite. Very crowded, cheap market type products/brands, nothing like the other shopping malls in Singapore. Our backpack was tied with cable tie's before entering shopping complex by security (felt like we were criminals). Taxi's reluctant to take us, i am assuming due to traffic congestion, narrow streets. Customer service non existent. Very disappointed."
,,Good Shopping Mall,4.0,,It has an best shopping experience with all varieties to shop. Comming to the price not much best. Its medium. But manny people warned me before buying GOLD that they dont give the EXACT 24/22/18 carrot when they promised to give... That has to be an warning. But manny times we get at other places the best ones.
,,24 hrs open Indian Store!!,4.0,,I got my SIM card in 03.00 hrs night..you'll find everything you required. I pregfer to visit this place after midnight as less crowdy. You'll find all the Indian stuff...even Kingfisher beer.
,,Not a typical Singapore shopping mall,3.0,,"This place does not provide you first world shopping experience.

It is over crowded most of the time, insufficient and not so well maintained toilet facilities, insufficient number of elevators, excessive security measure like sealing our bags before entering, etc...

If you want a first class customer service, shop elsewhere. If you just want cut throat pricing or want to purchase authentic Indian food items, this is a one stop shop for all of those needs.

Pricing isn't always the lowest in Singapore. Of course there are other shops where you can get a better bargain. The main attraction of Mustafa is, you can shop all the items you want under a single roof. If you are a traveller visiting Singapore for a short duration and want to do quick shopping, Mustafa is the place to go.

It is one of very few shopping places in Singapore that is open 24/7 year round.

Getting taxi is a nightmare experience. Most taxi drivers are unwilling to enter that area due to narrow lanes and perennial traffic congestion.

If you are someone who want to flag a taxi in a more orderly manner, then come out of Serangoon plaza building. There is a taxi stand right at the entrance of Serangoon plaza.

There is a overhead pedestrian bridge connecting main building and Serangoon plaza. It is located on level 3 of main building."
,,No haggling,4.0,,Second time here. Get our footwear from here walked out with three pairs of shoes. Cheaper than Australia. Reasonably priced.
,,Also bad experience at Mustafa Money Exchange,1.0,,"I experienced Mustafa Money Exchange as totally unprofessional and random. It is my last day in Singapore and I am running out of Singapore Dollars, but of course I do not want to exchange too much money as I am leaving tomorrow morning. So I went to Mustafa Money Exchange to change only NZ$ 10. Unexpectedly they actually change it without complains. So far so good.
Later this day I found a great present for my friend at home which unexpectedly used up all my Singapore Dollars. Therefore I went back to Mustafa Money Exchange to change another NZ$ 20. The same guy then told me that the limit was NZ$ 50. I couldn't believe what he was saying and reminded him that I change NZ$ 10 this very morning. He persisted and I had to leave without new cash. When I did not understand him first, because he was mumbling behind a thick glass wall, he became even angry and started yelling.
I would have understood that they do not change anything less than 50 Dollars, but to change it without complaints in the morning and refuse to do it on the same afternoon, that is just unprofessional and arbitrary. So, I cannot recommend Mustafa Money Exchange. There are plenty of other Money Exchanger near by - with friendly stuff."
,,Do the staff have diplomas in rudeness and ignorance?,1.0,,I visited the Mustafa centre recently with a French friend and her elderly mother. The old lady is 82 and it was her first time outside of France since the 1970s. We were rudely spoken to by the security staff who place plastic ties on all bags. The ground floor staff did not want to know nor help and the cashiers were very rude and made no attempt to talk and simply pushed our items to the end of the desk and chucked a plastic bag at us. There is a nasty smell too on the lower floors and the money changers seems to be racist when dealing with white people. I WILL NEVER go back there. I shall add that the toilets were disgusting too!
,,Shopping again!,4.0,,"This mall is walking distance from Drop Inn we stayed. we walked about 10 mins, suddenly the place where the mall is become so alive, so many people, can be crowded. try not to carry other shopping bags, because I need to put mine with the bags counter. The mall has so many things to buy, from watches, perfume to souvenier. We bought lots of chocolates and the packaging looks designer too. I like shopping here too, good price and cheaper.. I can also get my tax refund here."
,,little india indeed,4.0,,"Very big shopping place, prices were affordable, its a chocolate haven in there...though, all food werw indian cuisine"
,,Best place in singapore to shop.,4.0,,Its very wonderful palace to Shop all house needs. Placed on center of town. Staffs quite nice. You can purchase all your needed items etc
,,"Lot of options, huge, poor staff",4.0,,"Have been here many times.
You can get almost everything here.
Rates are good too.
But the staff specially in the non grocery section is very rude.
It gets crowded on weekends. So go during week days
Good collection of indian food items, chocolates and electronic items."
,,Wow...This has everything,5.0,,You can spend a lot of time in this place and also get lost. It is so big and the aisles are just crammed with everything you could think of. We came here mainly to buy some fresh fruits and also to buy some candy and some cooking sauces and spices. There is so much variety I was absolutely stunned. This is certainly a one stop shopping center for everything you would every need to buy.
,,Gold Buyer Beware,1.0,,"Mustafa has a big gold scam going on for YEARS!! It is in how they calculate per gram price. Here is how they fool everyone. Gold price all over the world is based on Troy Ounce which is 31.10 grams/ounce. In fact the world market per ounce price of gold is for 31.10 grams/ounce. This is not something anyone can deny. The standard ounce is 28.35 grams which has nothing to do with gold or silver measurement. Mustafa claims their 24k gold price matches the world market price. They publish the per ounce price but calculate the gram price by dividing the price by 28.35 rather than 31.10. This nets them almost 10% higher per gram price. Here is how you can confirm this. Ask for the 1 ounce Austrian or Australian or Canadian or American Eagle gold coins. They are usually exactly around 31.10 grams and they are made by the respective governments. When you try to buy this coin they will charge you for 3 grams more. Don't be fooled, do your math."
,,Must go for all in SG,5.0,,"Loved to go to Mustafa market every time. Always busting with people, its the best place to shop in Singapore. Specially for Indians, as you can easily get all Indian stuff here like Indian food, MTR, Indian brands. Whatever is the stuff one takes. A best price is guaranteed."
,,Good place to change money!!!,3.0,,"I recently visited Mustafa center. We were too tired after a long day so we didn't go too deep. They have huge money changers outside. The price quoted for INR was one of the best I'd seen during my visit. It was at-least a rupee cheaper than the price I got through using my credit & debit cards & bank rates at Changi Airport. They have different rates for 100, 500 & 1000 Rs notes, with best prices given to 100 Rs notes. So, it's better to take 100 Rs notes & get it exchanged at Mustafa center.

We bought a bread from there at $1.5 which we later found was available at $0.9 at nearest Seven-Eleven. Not sure how cheap was other items inside but my sense is that they won't be much cheap if I use example of my bread.

Still, it's a nice place to go & checkout if you have time."
,,"Everything's here, cheaper price",4.0,,"I like Mustafa Centre best especially for the needs of supplements & medicine. Seems that all brands are there. I could find them quite easily as long as I was in the particular zone. The place was very big & just as I wrote in the title : everything's provided here! Supplements, medicine, toiletries, snacks from crackers until chocolate, drinks, clothings, household needs from curtains till pans & woks, Singapore souvenirs, stationery, toys, DVDs (India movies), shoes & slippers, suitcases & bags, watches from cheap ones until branded, accesories for women from pearls, silver and even gold & all kinds of electronic gadgets from wires until newest brands of handphones & TV. And most importantly, mostly they're cheaper than those in malls & other supermarkets. They're 4 Mustafa Centre buildings now, one of them opens 24 hours & is connected to Serangoon Plaza through a level 3 bridge. Everything's stacked from floor to the ceiling & mostly crowded, so I have to read the direction signs & notices that I can find things easily & most importantly I can find my way out. When I bought things more than $100, I knew I could claim for GST refund. The forms were provided in B2 floor Mustafa Centre main building which could be found quite easily based on the directions attached at the shop ceilings."
,,Frustration-free place to take care of some quick shopping,4.0,,"I had a 10-hour layover in Singapore, and I had to buy some assorted computer and electronics goods that are just not available the country where I live. So after looking into various other markets, I decided to go to the Mustafa Centre, located in Little India. Most of the shopkeepers and many of the customers seem to be of Indian descent.

This is basically a bunch of smaller shops that have joined together with a centralized cashier and payment system. Prices are standardized throughout the market, so there's no need for comparison shopping or haggling. They sell everything from cell phone cases to computers to clothes to health care products to electrical adaptors to movie DVDs and music CDs.

Found everything I needed here, at a reasonable price. I am from the US, so comparing prices with Amazon.com, I found everything for very similar prices, maybe 5-10% higher. In an expensive country like Singapore, I was happy with that.

If you're on a layover like me and buying a lot/expensive products, try to combine them into one cashier trip, and make sure to visit the GST refund counter in the second basement to get a receipt so you can get the 7% refund at the airport. I believe you have to purchase at least 100 SGD worth of goods in order to qualify for the GST receipt. The cashiers zip-tie your plastic bags after you purchase to minimize shoplifting."
,,Pros and cons about equal each other,3.0,,"Pros include:
1. Open 24/7
2. Wide range of goods.
3. Often (but not always) best available price in Singapore.
4. Money changer open essentially 24/7 with several counters at two locations - generally with the best rates (e.g. the smallest spread between buying and selling rates for a particular currency). Rates clearly posted - and also available on Mustafa's Website. Rates may be slightly less good at night, however, if you are trying to absolutely maximize your exchange of a large amount.

Cons
1. Very crowded neighbourhood.
2. Packed inside.
3. Service staff are harried - and are rarely ""stylish"". Don't expect them to linger for your questions.
4. Check all details - more than once if necessary during the purchase process. Is the item you are looking at all OK? If an item that should have a warranty - confirm the details (not just with the sales sample - but with the item presented to you to buy which might be different from the display sample). Don't expect after-sales service.
5. If this is your first time, finding it from the MRT may not be straightforward. However, you can ask almost any local - and likely get pointed in the right direction.
6. Exchanging large amounts (e.g. over $5000) at the money changer may be much more convoluted than for smaller amounts (for reasons which one may imagine).

==>Because of Mustrafa's reputation for ""ambiance"" and ""vibe"" not all other merchants in Singapore have gone out of business!

====>But also, because of Mustafa's reputation for prices - and perhaps also for its reputation for ""ambiance"" and ""vibe"" it has loads of repeat customers!"
,,"great shopping centre,all in one place.",5.0,,"From a toothpick to whatever you want ,you will find it there,not a car I don't think,best shoes designs,good prices ,food as well,its a shame that what I trying to buy I cannot find it online though."
,,Pretty big,4.0,,a nice place to explore and everything could be found under 1 roof...the best part is it is open 24 hrs so u can visit whenever u want...and lots of eating joints around so all in all a good place to hang out
,,Anything & Everything!,4.0,,"Where do you go to catch a bargain?
MUSTAFA CENTRE!
Where do you go to find anything & everything?
MUSTAFA CENTRE!

We caught a cab to the Little India district & was gobsmacked by the escalator upon escalator Mustafa Centre.
At the entrance, they will place cable ties on your existing shopping bags, if you choose to carry them in, instead of leaving them at the front storage area which is guarded.
Inside is a frenzy feast for the shopaholic.
I bought an eye liner sharpener that I swear to be the best ever!!!
If you don't mind crowds, the Mustafa Centre is a must see! They sell anything & everything!"
,,Go to the place next door for the Mustafa shoe store galore!,5.0,,"Mustafa's never ceases to provide a great range of EVERYTHING. If you love shoes and you love a bargain, then this is the place to be! I buy such good quality shoes for less than $15 a pair. I bought literally 10 pairs the first time and the second time I bought 8 pairs!

Beware it is crowded and there are no places to sit and try the shoes on but otherwise this is the only place that is truly spectacular at the mustafa centre."
,,Good place if you are careful,2.0,,"You get a very good variety of products here from shoes, sports equipments, toys, perfumes, medicine, computer stuff, jeweleries etc... Prices are also reasonable compared to Malaysian prices as well. The only thing is you need to be careful before purchasing.

I bought a toy helicopter and I was asked to pay before testing it. Then after paying when they are testing the helicopter didnt fly properly but the blades were working. They said it's because the battery is not charged properly and when checked it was not charged fully. Then I took it and came back to Malaysia and even after charging it didn't work. Then I had to go back and ask for an exchange. Then I took another one and it worked even without properly charging.

I think they knew it is not going to work with their body language and I think it was my mistake to take their word. Therefore please be careful on taking their word, better to trust yourself rather than them"
,,One stop shop,5.0,,"Most of your shopping needs will be met if you can cover Mustafa Centre. Word of caution, spread across 2 blocks each with 7 storeys you might not be able to cover everything in 1 or 2 visits. Must visit if you are in Singapore. Minutes from Little india and farrer park mrts"
,,Very bad attitude staff,1.0,,"Their staff are not really helpfull in directions especially security. And when you leave the shopping they will a look at you as though you've stollen something from the shop. This attitude might varies for different group of people, (eg race, skin, country). I would not recommend my friends and others to shop here. There are other places to shop, like china town, bugis, marina bay sand and suntec city."
,,Crazy..during Deepavali !,3.0,,"Happened to walk in during deepavali and man was it like a stampede.. they had to restrict people from entering the place simply because it was becoming too overcrowded ; and that was the first time i had ever seen a shopping arcade do such a thing . I came out to leave my bags however had to wait one hour to get inside since they had to close down the entrances.. and took me additional 30 mins to find my wife inside .... it was scary...

Some things that i need to say
1) Selection of shoes - simply awesome all the brands in one roof not too sure on the authenticity though but feel and looks like the ""real deal""
2) Chocolates - i think the cheapest in singapore ; could be wrong with this though , checked a few places but prices in mustafa was unbeatable
3) i was told it is 24 hours good to check , if this is true suggest to visit them at 2.00am on wards for ease and peace of mind :)
4) Don't ever think of visiting the Wash rooms.."
,,Crowded but great!,4.0,,"Whatever you need to buy when in Singapore, this is the place to go. I love the Indian groceries there. I even got a water massage once in a machine that was fabulous. If u don't mind the crowds, go with plenty of time to browse. There's tons of things to buy. The prices are great for Singapore."
,,One stop shop,2.0,,crazy place.service poor.but you can have all what you want.like whole singapore in one place.dont go there on fridays.
,,"Bustling, busy, full, and fun!",4.0,,"I had no expectations when visiting here, so it didn't disappoint! I was able to find product I can't buy in China, and that was helpful! The prices were low compared to items I can buy in China, so that was also helpful to be able to load up before returning home. I didn't get to see the entire (massive) space, but I sincerely believe they have just about everything you could need to purchase, besides food. They might even have that, but if don't know! I was there on a Saturday night about 10:00 pm, and it was definitely busier than I would've expected for that time in the evening. There was a bit of help available from staff and they were friendly enough. The line to check out was a bit long, but because I was in no hurry, I people-watched and had a great time. I can't compare it to a ""Singapore shopping experience"", because I'm not exactly sure if that involves flea markets or the ION center. Give it a go, it's great fun just to look!"
,,Felt uneasy but cheap shopping,3.0,,"Visited on a weeknight as on weekends it does get crazy! It was so crowded, smelly & I felt a little uneasy due to reading about pickpockets, but I made due I was aware of my surroundings & bag. My unease was mostly outside in the open area/night markets but once inside the shopping centre, I relaxed a little. Huge centre with escalators to take you to different levels, the only shop open 24hrs in Singapore. Night market opposite Mustafa Centre which was for me sensory overload!!!"
,,One Stop Shop,5.0,,"Mustafa Centre is an Aladdin's cave of ""stuff"". And it's a lot of stuff. To put it simply.......if they don't have it, you don't need it! Enough said."
,,A big waste of time,2.0,,Cleary over rated. Nothing great at all Was very crowded and clumpsy There are better places to shop in Bugis and China town as compared to
,,okayissh,3.0,,"You can find almost everything in one place but the service is not great.They do sell a lot of things, from Men's clothes, Saree's to baby stuff, Electronics,Sports etc. it s not a mall, Just a big shop. So if your looking for the Singapore shopping experience, this is not the place."
,,The most astounding shopping experience,5.0,,"Visting Serangoon Road on a Sunday, especially, is like being a bustling South Indian City. Its vibrant and pulsating with heaving masses. One of the epicentres of Little India, as they call it here i Singapore, is Mustafa Centre and words simply cannot adequately express just simply how amazing this place is. You can find most anything you want. From an obscure tool of engineering to the latest in electronics to the freshest produce and spices from any corner of the world, including Sumac from the Middle East to fashion accessories and gold. The list is endless. The place is 24 hours a day 7 days a week. The shelves are well stocked, the merchandising of items respectable and tidy, the staff well presented and helpful and the bathrooms clean. (Yes, the bathrooms). Given the masses of crowds that visit from all corners of the world, it must an incredible feat of management to keep this place ticking and working in the way it continues to do so.

If you want a true experience of how the masses in the world shop the Mustafa is the place to be. Forget Orchard and it shiny and sparkling and expensive brand centres. Head to Mustafa for a true experience of Asian shopping."
,,Something Indian and Something different,4.0,,"Right, if you don't mind sour grumpy staff, and general absence of designer labels, then come here. This store sells everything, if you want it i am sure they have it. It is huge. It is open 24 hours of the day even days of the week. If you have ever visited our lived in an Indian /Pakistani area in the UK, you will be familiar with hard working shopstaff and shelves overflowing. Mustafas is just like that, i think it has 11 floors, i have regularly bought laptop bags, suitcases and miscellaneous phone cables here. When I'm hungry i just had upstairs and have authentic Pakistani food. Love it."
,,Not all that,2.0,,"I Visited this place as everyone was going on about how cheap it is, bla bla bla.
They do sell a lot of things, from Men's clothes, Saree's to baby stuff. it s not a mall, Just a big shop. So if your looking for the singapore shopping experience, this is not the place. Its not in the city centre either, you have to go to an indian part of town."
,,Atrocious service at Musthafa,2.0,,"Our family of four,were in Singapore for 8 days.

Having heard a lot about musthafa and its all under one roof availability at competitive rates,we visited on two occasions.we visited their perfume counter as well as souvenir counters.The staff manning those counters did not know about the products and were more keen on gossiping among themselves than attending the customer.we spent more than an hour and left in disgust .The pricing too is not competitive as they claim.felt cheated"
,,Worth a look for shopping,5.0,,"An alternative place to the malls of Orchard Rd for shopping is Mustafa Centre/Serangoon Plaza in Little India. It can be hard to see where one stops and the other starts. The MC is rather like a massive department store that operates 24/7, with goods organised into sections (eg clothes, electronics, toiletries, perfumes, food, kitchenware, travel goods ...)
The prices are set at a level for selling to members of the local community, not for selling to cashed-up tourists.
It is worth checking this place out, regardless of buying anything, but we were very satisfied with our purchases (perfume and travel goods).
Access by MRT is easy."
,,"Mustafa's ""You want it they have it"" you'll be surprised.",4.0,,"Mustafa's centre is not for the shopper that seaks glamor and first class service,instead what you'll find is a shopping centre that is more of a bazaar on a multi level connecting buildings that holds a variety of goods that one would find spanned into three of the most diverse cultures on earth.Lets be frank if you want prestige goods and service go to vivo city or tangs or even far east plaza,this is a centre for any one who wants a true bargain without bartering.Most people that visit Mustafa's are surprised by its age and unkept condition that's seen by most to be run down and not clean,and yet it is the busiest shopping centre in Singapore.Why is this so?,to put it simply it has it all,from food,spices fashion,perfumes,fresh produce,non pricribtion health and buety product to the most intricate and fine jewelry in Singapore and the only shopping centre that's open twenty four seven 365 days of the year.

I've seen multi millionaires shopping here and the poor as well,why because they can and that's what's special about Mustafa's their is no discrimination of any sort.Any one and every one is welcome to shop and not be snubbed,after all money is money and as long as you have money even if it's foreign they will exchange it or you at Mustafa's so you can shop.Personally I love it,it reminds me of the middle east,the far east bazaars with modern influences that you can't find in western cultures any where in the world.Ive seen and visited many around and this has its own charm that boggles your mind and satisfies your senses to a degree in which you will never experience any where you've been.I also know many neighboring countries send there house mades to Singapore to shop at Mustafa's simply because they don't have what singapores Mustafa's have,now that's a statement on its own.If your after gold then visit its jewelry section,one whole floor devoted to gold and gem jewelry and crafted in 22kt or 24kt or sterling silver.But one should note they do not deal in 9,10,14,18kt gold as this is seen as absurd and they'd probably laugh at you or think your pulling their leg.Some of the intricate work put into the pieces of jewelry take months to make and can not be found in any western jewelry shop simply because the workmanship would never be found and probably cost you triple the price.I've even seen a 10kg 99.999 % pure gold coin going for a mere $256,000.00 dollars that's tax free to.Unfortunetly taking photos is not permitted otherwise I'd upload a few for you to dribble at.This establishment is now in its 50 plus years in operation and is now considered to be a national treasure by the government and the locals, one word of warning if you do go to Mustafa's go early morning and try to avoid the weekends as its the busiest time for shopping especially on a Sunday.

I'm sorry for the long wrap of this review,but one should not leave out what really matters,yes you do get grumpy staff,and yes it's crowded most of the day any day for that matter but seeing and experiencing what Mustafa's is all about is a true adventure on it's own.So have a open mind,prepare for the unexpected,wear sensible shoes and enjoy the true flavors of Singapores multicultural people's choice shopping precinct.Found only in little India."
,,Horrible service!,2.0,,"The cashier being rude to me just because i hold the handle of basket with only one hand, she yelled at me :"" the basket wil break if you hold like this!!"" And she give me a scornful look!! I just ignore her and busy to put all the things i want on the cashier table…after i paid everything (i had purchased $200 above), a word of thank you never come out from her mouth! Because of that rude behavior, I am re-considering to visit here again or recommend any of my friend who wanna visit here!! I wish they can improve their service as in polite way which even a 3years old kid can do it with a smile , a ""thank you"" word or ""please""………"
,,Almost everything,4.0,,Place to go when you need anything to everything..near to little Inida this place has almost everything from a pin to perfumes to clothes to food to almost everything...First I thought that only INdians would be around this place but then almost all the races were there shopping...Not very cheap place but yes You have all the things there atleast...
,,Staffs In Mustafa,1.0,,"I would like to bring this point to higher level management.

Most of staffs will not be working at their position. Always talking with their colleagues. The boss of the Mustafa must send some one as a customer to evaluate the customer service.

Most of the worker behave like they are the big boss. Before get a job they bow down act like a slave once got the job they attitude like big boss.

70% of the staffs in Mustafa having the same nature. No body have job fear"
,,Day night shopping,4.0,,"You get practically everything from pin to any thing you name, clothes, toiletries, household articles, chocolates, pharmacy, shoes, electronics, etc. If you are travelling from foreign country don't forget to take back tax refund. Get it stamped from the counter and at the airport you will get @ 8-10% of your billed amount as refund"
,,Fantastic shop!,4.0,,They have everything from clothing to iPod accessories to food and luggage! Open 24/7. It's located in little India and getting there by taxi is cheap (all the taxi fares are cheap) :-) However do not go on a Sunday unless you like crowds :-)
,,"The more you look, the more you find",5.0,,"I feel I can speak with some degree of authority, only because we have been regularly (weekly) shopping here for the past four years. Mustafa is an experience not to be missed if visiting, and is a surprisingly good for routine shopping - there aren't many places where you can get pretty much everything you need under one roof, from bananas, to a printer to dinner on the rooftop. Sure there is some terrible tat there (head to the Singapore souvenirs section if you want a giggle), but there is also a lot of imported goods from the UK, US and Australia along with routine basics.

If you don't want crowds, choose your time. We go before 10am on a weekend and usually it is clear. Remember, this is Singapore, and shopping is a day out for a lot of people, with three generations out at once, so it can, and will get busy. The customer service can be lackluster, but that is something here that isn't only confined to Mustafa - but in the same breath normally staff are very knowledgeable about where things are, so do ask.

We routinely take visitors there, and have developed ""the Mustafa Tour"" taking in some of the peculiarities and more amusing products (the cow urine is always a crowd pleaser).

So go, but choose your time. There is no map so explore, change floors and ask. Best entrances to use are those on Verdun Road - you can cross to the ""other side"" in the shop, either above ground or below ground."
,,you cannot stop buying,5.0,,"think of an item and its there, electronics galary , fashion material for male and females, kitchen equipments,camera , watches , eatables of variety , sea food , toys , dry fruits ,"
,,What an unexpected surprise,4.0,,"We didn't know what to expect visiting Mustafa but absolutely loved it. The selection on men clothes was pretty spectacular, the supermarket in the centre absolutely mind blowing. I was amazed by the range of international food brands. The only let down in my opinion was the lack of women clothes, not sure if we just didn't find that section but even after asking we only found a small area with Indian clothes for women.

However, it was worth a visit and we will be back"
,,hectic but all in one shopping experience,4.0,,"the mall is located on serangoon road, the popular indian area.
its far bigger and amazing than any other shopping mall in the world, because it is like a maze , which u have to navigate from one floor to the other , going through under the road at some places, while walking up is provided only at particular places.

but the best thing is that they have all the things u can ever imagine from gold to kitcheware to grocery to cars, at a very reasonable rate.

to go to this place , a person must have target or a list of items to purchase otherwise might get lost in the amazing shopping jungle"
,,International Supermarket in Little India,4.0,,"This is unbelievable : it has everything from all the world, but mainly products from India and Asia. For me it was very interesting to look at all these strange items from all over the world.
I bought interesting and very cheap soaps, tooth pastes, stainless steel lunch boxes and other small things, but you can get there everything 24/7.
It is close to the MRT Park Farell station and a bit further away from the Lavander MRT station.
Bring toilet paper with you if you plan to visit the wash room as they don't provide it (and this is very rare for Singapore)."
,,The more you look..,4.0,,"The more you find.

We stayed at Park Royal Kitchener Road and the Mustafa Centre is directly behind. We visited here twice, once using the supermarket section at about 7pm, no cheaper than Fair Price over the road but heaps more choices and not the crowds that others have talked about in reviews. It was tight to walk around but not crowded.

Then second visit picked up up batteries, a few electrical bits, iPod covers, connectors, USB hubs same prices as you would get on eBay in Australia but here you don't wait six weeks for delivery. Still no crowds at 5pm on a weekday.

Also a pair of shoes reasonably good price. We walked away then because we were about to be caught up in the size of the centre and volume of stuff from gold to clothing.

Like all shopping, if you know what you need/want, know the price you would pay at home and don't get caught up in the moment, you'll have some fun at Mustafa."
,,Great place to find things not available easily elsewhere,4.0,,"I went here to find a specific face exfoliator - I was excited to find it in bulk much cheaper than I can get online in Australia!
Whilst here I spent a good couple hours wandering around the shop & purchased a couple hundred dollars in other items. Great store if you have couple hours to blow & are looking for regular items for reasonable prices."
,,Lowest Price in Town for most of the stuff,5.0,,"This is the place to get cheap stuff. Be it toys, electrical appliances, branded pen. This is one place you cannot miss. Try to go there during weekday. It open 24 hrs however certain session will be close at certain time. Good place to short."
,,All the things you need,4.0,,"Located near our hostel, this shopping establishment offers you everything: from grocery items, personal stuff to electronic items. It is a five or six-storey building. Truly it's a one-stop shop. Prices are average though."
,,Worst Customer Service and Store manager on the planet,1.0,,"I needed to buy a lot of jewellery for family needs so decided to go to Mustapha because of their supposed large collection and everything under one roof. When I reached the shop the woman behind the counter hesitantly stopped her chatting and showed some necklaces. Throughout the viewing she kept insisting that we should go somewhere else. Initially I got offended thinking she was some kind of racist and dint want to sell to me... but sooner i realised she wanted us to buy from any other shop because when we shortlisted 2 chains (more than 2K SGD) she tells us the neighbouring shop is much much better and we should try that out.. so it was only 8 pm so we decided to give it a try and told her to hold onto the 2 items... then we asked her wat time her shop closes and she says ""Dont worry sir its open till 10.30"". We go check out the other shop and come back since we didnt like the options. Now its 10.00 pm and we reach back to Mustapha and the woman happily with a grin says ""Oh Sorry Sir the shop is closed now""... so i was pissed (as anyone should be) and told the manager and he says ""Oh sir if its 10 pm then its closed"" and ""The sales woman is right"" and slyly grins... the employees seem too disgruntled to sell anything.. Good Luck shopping in Mustapha jewellery!"
,,One Stop Shop Indeed,4.0,,"What's not to like? It's a 24-hour shopping empire. Food, groceries, fragrance, cosmetics, jewelry, electronics, money changers (best rates in SG)... it was extremely overwhelming.

Now, this is not where posh people shop so expect a bit of a crowd, narrow aisles and shelves crammed full of products. Go if you have a long list and a lot of time (not to mention energy!)."
,,Non stop shopping 24hrs ! So long way walking !,4.0,,If no where to go at night just visit here ! 24 hrs open ! Perfume couter provided cheaper price than others just check some real some not ! have 7 fls all full of product so many things here. 1 product have a thousand of brands. also cheap product mixed with expensive ! the mall surrounded by arab and indian restaurants and money changer (should they called currency exchange ? no idea why they use unofficial word instant of official ) ! So strange ! Bank reject currency exchange service but this is legel business for arab and indian people without licenses !
,,"Super crowded, jam packed,massive mall!",3.0,,"We went there only to find extra large sweater for gift. And boy we were surprised on what we've found. The mall is so huge, with many entrance, located in a very crowded area, surrounded by a lot of Indian Eateries. Lots of construction going on in this area. I did buy Olbas Oil there at the pharmacy (yes, Mustafa has pharmacy section to, and lots of vitamins available there).

We didn't find what we were looking for so we decided to eat. It's easy to find halal food here.

I don't reccomend this for family with small kids though."
,,Holy fire hazard!,4.0,,"This is definitely an interesting stop if you are from the States! Everything is jam packed into this large 24 hour department store. The aisles are crazy to navigate with large baggage, so if you can, ditch your bags in the hotel room or something. My best description of this store would be ""organized chaos"". The only difference between a customer and employee appears to be that the employee can walk behind the counters. Avoid weekends and travel light. The range of products are immense!"
,,Mustafa Shopping Experience,5.0,,"Mustafa Shopping : It is the only thing people go to Singapore for Shopping , a huge mall, with logically placed items like electronics, clothings tec"
,,nice shopping center,4.0,,This mustafa Shopping center was good please where you can find A-Z things whatever you like to buy but i think not so much good quality one. It will open for 24 hour that's gr888. Once i llike to be there agin when i will be in singapore.
,,An indian-themed shopping centre,3.0,,"Actually this is the same like other shopping centre, but I like the chocolate section of this shopping centre, it was really provide a lot of variations of chocolates and snacks, there were also some spesific indian things, like sari which is good, there was also a money changer with good rates nearby."
,,Had bad experience with clothing,1.0,,"Don't buy any cloth from this center. Cloths are below average quality and will not last for one wash. I had bad experience, bought some suite and got shrink after first dry cleaning. It was not up to average quality. There is not customer care provision. You will not get any reply."
,,Best shopping in town!,5.0,,"Orchid Rd seems to be the only place for shopping in Singapore but that's true only if you have unlimited funds on your credit card. Didn't know Mustafa before discovering it while walking in Little India: it's a paradise for shopping! Lots of stuff for everything and everybody: sports, foods, electronics, shoes, garments and all that you can imagine is concentrated in this mall. Prices are very low and quality is good."
,,another shopping haven,4.0,,"lots of electronics, gadjets, souvenirs, chocolate to be found here. just alight at Farrer Park MRT and you can see mustafa centre. around 1 km further is Narayan where handphones are sold cheaply everyday."
,,Public Holiday Crowding,4.0,,Dont go on public or national holidays as very crowed and centre was closed due to overcrowding otherwise some very good bargins to be had
,,Surprise Package - Excellent place to Shop,4.0,,"It is one of the biggest shopping centre with the heaviest crowd, I have ever seen. You can find anything and everything here, right from batteries to television, undergarments to dresses, it has everything you can think of. It covers a very wide area and is split between two buildings, with each floor having its own product line. Unlike a usual mall where you find shops of different brands, here you find everything on stalls with multiple cash counters at every ten step. You pick up and you get it billed, by the end you find yourself loaded. The variety is so huge that you get tired of just choosing the right one. Just for eg I was looking for a black handbag for gifting and I had to choose from almost two hundred variety of black handbag.

I visited the place twice, the first time just to take a feel and the second time to buy gifts, like I said it has everything from souvenirs to chocolates. On my first visit I easily managed to forget my way outside the building and almost spent 15 minutes locating the exit, with this you can well imagine how crowded and packed it is. My second visit was at the time of Singapore Independence Day (local holiday) which resulted in jam packed elevators, to no place to even walk. It is a place where everybody is shopping from grocery to gifts and is especially crowded on holidays.

It is a must go for everybody to experience the real shopping. No bargaining and endless variety. It is close to little India and has lot of Indian eateries around, so a good place to enjoy the food and shop. Some key facts:

* Don't visit Mustafa on a public holiday
* You almost never get a taxi from Mustafa - either pre-book it or walk to a different street
* It is open 24 hrs, so you can visit at anytime
* Place for doing bulk shopping and not branded shopping"
,,excellent,5.0,,it is one of the biggest shopping center in Singapore works 24 hours.from safety pin to led TVs available here.
,,Interesting unexpected finds,4.0,,"On Sunday, went to Little India for a curry and a walk around Mustafa. We wanted to see what this was all about, and we were not disappointed. Do not expect great bargains on electronics but we have found interesting everyday items such as food, medicine, cosmetics, kitchen accessories, tourist souvenirs. Aisles are narrow, but there are good signs inside and we did not have any problems. Minutes from Farrer Park exit H."
,,An excellent place to shop for almost anything,4.0,,"The Mustafa Center is located between the Little India and Farrer Park MRT station.But better if you stop at Farrer Park because its nearer,Just go across the street and you will find a very crowded place ,with indian restaurants, and money changers.Next to it lies the Mustafa Center.This place is great for shopping daily necessities ,gifts , electronics, and almost anything imaginable.Local peoples shop here , and nowadays can find many tourists hanging around this place.The shop opened for 24 hours , nice to spend the rest of your night here , if you are short of plans.For budget travellers ,you can stuff your daily needs ,water,cheap instant eateries, soaps ,shampoos etc within a small budget."
,,I love Mustafa,5.0,,"Every time I travel to Singapore I try and shop at Mustafa. They have such a huge range of products. I'm a typical male and hate shopping but can easily spend a couple of hours wandering around. Typically like to buy footwear (its a bit hit and miss on sizing but can get great specials, this trip purchased some Merrill gortex shoes and some non slip thongs) plus meanswear section is great. Plus open 24/7. Cheers John"
,,Huge venue with the same stuff repeated...,3.0,,"SO been here many times. first when it was one building now it spans another building over the street. anything from shoes, clothes, grocery lines, jewelry, gifts etc. Pretty cluttered place with things everywhere. some places are very cramped to walk through. watch out for the pricing some things can be bought cheaper elsewhere. the buzz wears off after 5 mins of being in this place."
,,Never on a Sunday...,4.0,,"Awesome variety of items on display at Mustafa Center - some not even available in India inspite of being manufactured in India. It also has the distinction of never being shut. Its visited equally by the local population as well as the tourists. However beware of a fact, never - read NEVER visit them on a sunday."
,,Average place,3.0,,"Although most recommended by tour operators, but I didnt find this place very interesting. The cost of items here is also not very competative.
Its open 24X7. Note that is this very very very big shopping place, so you might get caught up seeing unncessary things"
,,Good place to shop,3.0,,Crowded but an amazing variety of goods. Best to visit early mornings. Worst time to visit Friday nights. The new restaurant is ok..
,,Unprofessional security staff and system,1.0,,"I paid for everything I bough ( stationary items ) but while coming out their security systems starting ringing, security staff checked my bills and thoroughly every item but could not find anything wrong , they treated me like a thief and asked me to come to supervisor room and u refused . I asked then Check items here , if nothing wrong let me go and fix your system yourself . I had another appointment . They wasted my time and finally let me go. I was treated badly by lady staff at gate no 1 . There is no contact no on Mustafa website to complain"
,,"If you need it, they probably have it..",5.0,,"Huge shopping mall in the heart of Little India not far from Swissotel and Fairmont. This place is big and full of the rand most things. At one point we couldn't figure our way out, since its so full of items that the lanes to walk through are narrow and hard to navigate. This place is built like a maze, a good way to keep people in because once you start walking around you are bound to find something that you think you need. Good way to spend a couple of hours away from the hot weather and explore some of the cheaper shopping options the the malls on Orchard street.

This place also has the best exchange rates compared to other changes. Definitely more then at the Airport so hold of in changing money elsewhere if you are headed here."
,,Hate Mustafa,1.0,,"It is huge, crowded and full of cheap c**p. If you need to get something here it might be hard to find and no one can help you. The cash registers are crowded and they make you use a plastic bag--bad for the environment..."
,,Good Place to Shop. Great Variety of Choices.,3.0,,"Mustafa Center located next to Farrer Park MRT station,
have a very large amount of choices of stuffs, from clothes, gadget, electronic devices, jewelry and accessories, and of course souvenirs.
the prices are also cheap, but if you need for cheaper price try to look around some shops around that area, they sell souvenirs cheaper, $10 for 3 items."
,,Mustafa centre,3.0,,"To big, too crowded, impossible to find stuff and staff who cannot communicate, are unhelpful and are unable to give directions to various departments. Goods weren't particularly inexpensive. Rooftop restuarant was hot, crowded but good buffet."
,,High Modern Supermarket and.. CHEAP!,5.0,,"I like the ambience.. err.. I prefer to go there at night.. around 12 am at night. Since it's open 24 hours. Not recommend to bring your baby there.. the space to walk around is not to spacious yet you still can make it though... You'll see many things here: pharmacy, accesorries, watch, jewelry, fashion, toys, cloth. whatever just name it, you'll find lot's of great things, including food.. it's more like grocery store, but you can buy pieces... and don't worry, it's air conditioned :)"
,,one stop shopping!,4.0,,"The place is like supermarket but the price is really cheap, if you looking for chocolate, this is the right place! The shirts and sandals not really cheap, but it's open 24 hours, and near from my hostel."
,,Many things to buy and bring to your home country,4.0,,"Except the gadget, you will find many dry foods, chocolates, souvenirs to buy. The price are cheap. Great store to explore for shopping mania! Just becareful since many people there (croud), but it was ok. May be a little bit difficult to find a cab but do not worry, you can use MRT."
,,24 * 7 shopping / not so great experience,3.0,,"Mustafa Centre is Singapore's only 24*7 working shopping mall located in little India. The mall is spread in 2 buildings and 4 floors. Its quite big with lots of varieties from food items to electronics, garments to perfumes / cosmetics. Almost everything. However as far quality stuff is concerned you may not get options in every category. The prices are usually higher than what you would get outside. Especially Electronics, if you happen to be from South Asian countries you may have temptation of buying electronic items like mobiles, LED / LCD TV from Singapore. My advise is don't waste your time at Mustafa rather go other electronic shops and buy them because prices are higher her. I inquired for Canon camera at Mustafa they quoted SGD 185 and same model I bought it for SGD 160 from the Changi Airport.

As far as staff is concerned they are arrogant and rude. So you will not have a great shopping experience here."
,,Crowded!!,3.0,,Good thing about this place is it is 24hrs. You can find good deals here. But there can also be fake items. Some perfumes smelt of alcohol mixed in them. Some chocolates are also a rip off.. be keen on what you are buying. Also this place is super crowded and chaotic so be prepared. If you want a quieter place to shop..just go to the local supermarket like fairprice and coldstorage. It's just a few cents to a dollar more expensive without the chaos. :-D
,,Purchasing a lenga for my 9 year old,1.0,,"My mother and 9 year old daughter visited the lenga section of Mustafa. The sales assistant was rude and did not respond to my mum's request for help to find the right size. She even told my mum off, and said ""you tried so many (pieces) and never buy"", and even reprimanded my 9 year old. Poor experience, although the selection of lenga was good."
,,One stop shop,5.0,,"You name it you find it , Unbelievable atmosphere , it's like a festival every time , I enjoy looking around"
,,Be prepared to get suffocated!,2.0,,"I went to Mustafa Centre couple of times, both the times it was very very crowded. I agree that this shop has almost everything and more. But I am not sure if there is a time when it is not overcrowded. You need a lot of patience to find your way around with the crowd, may be better to pay a little extra and shop somewhere else. But definitely worth visiting this crazy place once while you are in Singapore."
,,Total rip off .. lousy experience,1.0,,"Please check out the prices at other local locations before you buy at Mustafa's .. they are total cheats! I bought a Fuji camera for S$ 767 reading all the wonderful reviews and later found out Harvey Norman sold it for S$639 and valuebasket.com.sg for 620!! i felt cheated and miserable that i was taken for a ride! and found the same for other products that i picked up such as wii games, perfumes, pendrives, watches (kids and adults)... DO NOT GO there to shop.. too crowded, not friendly sales people.. no great brands in shoes, cloths etc.. in all very lousy experience.."
,,Rude and chaotic,2.0,,"I had heard that the Mustafa Centre was a ""must-see"", in terms of good places to shop in SG. I found the staff quite rude. I found that the prices were not that great. I can get items of equal or greater quality back home, for comparable prices. Due to the chaotic layout, I wasted too much of my time trying to find something worth buying. A disapointing experience, overall."
,,A different kind of shopping place in Singapore,4.0,,"We went here since lots of people recommended this place to us and it is true that Mustafa Centre is like Mydin in Malaysia. The price for the perfume is really good but later we found better deal in Dollar and Scent shop in Lucky Plaza.However, looking at the huge varieties of chocolate at really good price made us shopping like crazy. You can find any kind of chocolate here. And some chocolate got super cheap price because they will expire within 2 months which we considered its still great deal.

This shopping place provided us different kind of shopping experience and it is worth to come here.If its not for shopping, then maybe try it out to feel the ambient here. And outside the mall,there are lots of restaurant that offer Indian food.Next to the Mustafa Centre is Serangoon Plaza which basically is the same store,"
,,All under 1 roof,3.0,,"You can get everything you want here to shop... Like electronics , kitchenware, clothing , cosmetics , footwear and groceries!
Not all products are of good quality and some can even be expensive!

The place is always overcrowded and runs on 24/7 basis

Staff not at all friendly or helpful.... In fact they are rude making faces when asked for assistance
And I feel the place needs more staff especially at the cashier"
,,Variety but not cheap,3.0,,It's overwhelming large. Jammed full of stuff across two buildings. The items we looked at were not cheaper than outside at stores like Takashimaya where the staff were helpful and friendly. Lots of it seemed like cheap junk.
,,Shopping centre,3.0,,"This is a 24hr shopping centre with anything and everything you could want. and its cheap as well. Not something i would die to see but if you have time, then go for it."
,,Have patience and you will be rewarded,4.0,,"The center can be overwhelming, so you have to be patient and search for what you are looking for. The staff will leave you alone to go through all the items. Each floor has specific items, so make sure to check out the directory. Not every item is a good deal, so make sure that you know the prices of the items you are looking for, before you go in."
,,Just awful. Avoid!,1.0,,"Most clothing and footwear that we looked at was overpriced and poor quality. Floor staff stand around talking to each other or looking at their phones and couldn't be bothered providing any kind of customer service. Found some Ipanema thongs for $12.90 which was a good price. Lined up at the cashier and waited in line for 15 mins while bored looking staff scanned items, then once they had finished scanning they proceeded to slowly pack each item into bags! I hope they aren't paid much because they are hopeless. How much more efficient if they scanned and packed at the same time? Or have customers pack themselves? I imagine it's because the management couldn't care less as there will always be locals who will shop here and mug tourists who don't know any better."
,,"Cheap items , 24 hours operating hours",4.0,,"My friends bought a large sum of perfume at Mustafa, seems like the price is cheaper than your regular shops.They open 24 hours, easy access.Got Halal food restaurant.Money changer. And the briyani rice is excellent too"
,,"Everything you could want, if you can find it",3.0,,"We headed here one morning just to have a look at the electronics and get an overview of pricing. Instead of finding what we were after however, we stumbled across everything else you could ever want to buy, and everything you'd also never want to buy!

There was more chocolate in one section than in an actual chocolate factory, and more varieties of rice than I've ever seen in one location!

There seems to be no rhyme or reason for the location of items, and apart from general floor levels, (accessible by stairs and lifts)there seems to be no organisation whatsoever! We were on many an occasion completely lost as it's spread out over several buildings.

After 2 hours in here in the hustle & bustle, we'd had enough and left, still one the wiser on what we'd come to investigate!"
,,Shopping.. Shopping..,4.0,,"You can get everything in this place, big shopping centre, open 24 hours. This place is perfect for me, coz I am not very adept at bargaining. After shopping and if u feel hungry, dont worry coz there is a lot of eateris around this place (Indian flavours). One large portion of chicken biryani cost $ 5.5, and it can be eaten for 3 people."
,,Too much to take it on one trip!,4.0,,"If you want it...its in Mustafa shopping center. The only problem is trying to find what you are looking for. The place is several different buildings and has no sense of organization that I could make out. The deals are good but not great. It is a good place to get your Singapore souvineers all in one stop. T-shirts were cheaper in China town but you get what you pay for.
If you are looking to buy gold then Mustafa is the place to go. Visit building 4 on the second floor. This is where I bought gold but it is the same throughout all Mustafa. They post the current ""mustafa"" gold price on screens everywhere. This is not the current market price for gold but is only a slight markup for 22k jewelry. I had intended on buying a few 1 0z gold coins but the prices were higher than what I can get online. Current gold price per ounce at my visit was $1398/oz(USD) and mustafa price was $1604/oz(US dollars). Also remember that you are buying 22k gold jewelry and market price is for 24k. Gold jewelry is a good buy and a great investment at current prices."
,,"Expect Price and Completeness, Don't Expect Service",4.0,,"Many of my friends in Indonesia recommended me to shop at Mustafa. I'm not a shopping freak and therefore I wasn't really listening to them. Not until I had to shop since it was my last day in Singapore and it was quite late and at the same time my son in Jakarta would like me to buy him a children sword toy. How can I get that thing at 1 am? I have only 1 option: Mustafa. And so I rushed to this store and I was amazed with the size of the store. It was HUGE and sooooo unorganised. They even treated the buyers as if they are all thieves. I brought my bag and they insisted to tie it! And I saw that all buyers with bag were using this ties. Unbelievable.
But when I really entered the building, it was a paradise for shapping freaks. For Indonesians, it was similar to Mangga Dua. Branded products with a special price. You could find it almost everything. I found also the toys at the Basement 2. The kids will be gone crazy if they visit this floor. Please don't expect service from the staffs since it is not their expertise. Mustafa is famous for their completeness, reasonable prices and 24 operational hours and surely they are not well-known for their service. Will I come back ? SURE!"
,,Sunday after temple a bad move...,4.0,,"Musafa has everything and even though the prices are now only maybe 25% cheaper than the stores still an interesting place to shop.
Sunday afternoon was like a thousand people doing there shopping ( supermarket on the 3 floor) ,
souvenirs pretty hard to find , level 2 with the luggage and chocolates .
still an interesting experience for what it is to shop as a local indian in little india ......
dont forget to take out your wallet if your carrying a back pack as they cable tie shut at entry....."
,,Everything Available but No Bargains,3.0,,No bargain prices here though just about every product you can think of is somewhere in this sprawling warren of floors. If you find an item take it because you will never find your way back to collect it later.
,,shopping and shopping,5.0,,"Looking for something cheaper that open 24 hours ? Mustafa centre is the perfect place. they most sell accessories with cheap price, almost you can find anything cheap, even the electronics."
,,"""You can get everything here- Need to be Patient""",4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is one place where you can get everything & at a reasonable price (I would not say cheap). I could see lot of family coming for shopping for their household requirements for weeks & month. When I visited the first time I was totally confused. I told my family that this place is not worth spending time but when I visited the place again before coming back from Singapore, I found the place interesting. In fact I could find lot of things which probably I would have to search for in my country. I along with my family bought quite a few items at the centre.
You can find almost everything but you just need to have patience. The Centre is spread over a big area but worth visiting. If you have anything specific in mind probably you may find here.What I liked best was that there is corner for everything and has money vexchange facility too. What I liked least was that things are little unorganised(could have been better).
Ideally you should not bring any item & by any chance if uo are carrying any item it needs to be deposited or they will put a plastic tag so that you cannot open your bab.
One should plan for longer time at least 1/2 a day if you have come with a mood to shop."
,,Very Crowded avoid if you tourist and don't want to buy electronics items,3.0,,This place is very crowded and staff is super rude most of them don't bother to response your query. For clothes never choose this place as price is not cheap for quality goods. For electronics item much reliable than simlim square(cheap price but no guarantee of right item ) and cheaper than funan mall (Good place to buy electronics but bit costly than mustafa). Specially avoid little India and Mustafa on weekend as so much crowded. But this is very true you will find almost everything in Mustafa. But if you are the shopper looking for customer service please never choose mustafa as they don't care about customer.
,,All in one place,4.0,,"It is a huge hypermarket in Little India. Everything available there you just name it. Very crowded, there are plenty of hotels and eateries around, just opposite of The Claremont Hotel in Serangoon Road and 2minutes walk to Ferrer Park MRT and there is bus stop just in front of this shopping mall. Items are not cheap, you may get the same item cheaper in other shops, but one can buy everything from here no need to go one place to another for purchase.

Note for smoking tourists, you may bring your cigarettes to Singapore, here it is very costly. I bought 1 pack of Benson @ SGD 15/- (may be wrongly collected or else, but cigarette is costly).

I have noticed most of their customers are Indians or can say Asians and it seems LED/LCD TVs are their favourite pick from Mustafa Center."
,,Here You Can Find Everything,5.0,,"This shopping center open 24 hours and they sell everything from perfumes, electronics, clothes, and even groceries. I usually came here at midnight and it's very crowded. The price here is cheaper than other places."
,,Worth to visit,5.0,,If i went to Singapore i always go here because it's one stop shopping. You can buy a souvenir and chocolate also a watch. And it open for 24 hours
,,Crowd Crowd .,3.0,,"As usual with indians, I was put up in Little india, and was directed to mustafa for shopping.

the place is bit crowded, and cramped.

The pace is huge with lots of variety. An over sized hypermart. Before I went there I was under impression that things would be pretty cheap their. Not really.
I must admit I got a good deal on a few electronics items but thats not true for all the products sold their. Its not good for someone who is exploring mode and not aware of the normal prices. Make sure you decide beforehand, search on the net and then go shopping there. A few, maybe 5 - 10% of the products have an excellent deal. The remaining 90% of the products are at the same prices as other outlets."
,,I Looove shopping at Mustafa…..,5.0,,"What more could you want: 24 x 7 shopping, 5 or 6 levels across 2 or 3 buildings…. everything you need under one roof!!

I was once warned not to go to Mustafa after 5PM and that advice was good, but did I listen. After 5 this place is madness, I couldn’t believe that I was doing grocery shopping at midnight. Long weekends are even worse.

You can buy anything and everything here and walk with your shopping between the floors and pay at the cashier that is closest to where you want to exit.

This place must have shares in the manufacturer that makes cable ties! Everything and I mean everything gets cable tied. If you take a back pack in there you have to stop at security and get the zips cable tied together. When you buy something in there, they put it in the normal plastic bag, then wrap a cable tie around the top of each and every bag! Crazy…. I thought here they just “lock em up” ;-)

You can get money changed here, buy clothes, shoes, sporting equipment, jewelry, electrical items, DVD’s and CD’s, food (as in a full blown supermarket), dine on the top floor, there is an in-house pharmacist. I have never seen a shop with such a large chocolate area and its far cheaper than buying chocolate at the airport duty free.

Anyhow you must pay a visit if coming to Singapore and experience this for yourself. The surrounding area has plenty of Indian restaurants."
,,Everything @ one place,3.0,,"Well, This can be called as a shopper's destination. Except automobiles, you can get everything here. Branded and both. They have two complexes:- a 24 hr and another which closes @ 11 pm.

The prices seems to be affordable. But the only problem is it is always crowded.

So best time to shop is at night. Never go in the morning. Also, It is like a self service. ie..No staffs will be there to assist you except in few sections.

If you wanna buy mobiles, watches, chocolates etc. this is a good place to think."
,,24 hour shopping,4.0,,My husband who loves a bargain thought this was the bees knees - five stories of everything you can think of at bargain prices. Worth a look.
,,Crazy shopping experience,4.0,,"Crazy shopping centre - massive selection of goods at cheap prices. Selection though does repeat in different parts of the centre but it varies from health products, clothes, food and electronics. You have to see to believe but just note that if you go you may have to leave any bags (seems mainly shopping type bags) at the door - we went with a backpack with no issue but just be aware."
,,Visit,4.0,,Its a marvelous place where you can find anything you want at an affordable price.the new tower is good as well. the snack also provide delicious food
,,Rude Unprofessional Staff at Mustafa Centre Level B1,1.0,,"I went to buy some shirts at Mustafa and was really horrified to see their unprofessional staff. I don't know whether they are for serving the customers or for each other. Talking among themselves and always on phone. Come on, the customer wants to ask something but dear is busy talking blah blah on phone. When I finally interrupted and asked whether they have the next size of a particular shirt, he didnt even bother seeing, just told no-no we don't and resumed his blah-blah on phone.

Finally I found another one, bought it, but wanted to make sure that its not defective (can't trust, its our dear dear Mustafa Center after all) so asked the salesman in the shirts section if HE could just open up the shirt from the plastic a little and show before I go and pay at the counter. Mr. Salesman told me to pay first, okay I complied, paid the bill, took the shirt to him, then instead of HIM opening as he promised, he started telling me that come on, do it yourself. do it yourself. I wasn't sure if I could fold it back properly as it was a gift and I didnt want to mess it up (not so cheap too S$55). Ok he told he will fold it up once I have a look, okay no probs, I opened may be 60% only, and then when I asked him to help me fold it back properly he just hurriedly crumpled it up into the plastic bag and put the plastic lock on that. My God, how rude. I asked him come on its a gift, to which he replied, okay go home and fold it properly yourself. Come on, what is this, in other places u go, the sales people treat u as customer not as something u want to get rid off fast fast...Really idiotic staff. This was in Level B1 the shirt section - big fat dark shinned man in blue shirt..Should have asked his name and put it up here...really stupid people.."
,,Be carefull while buying gold!!!,2.0,,"Hi,
please be careful while buying gold from mustafa as there are times when they sell you 18k gold in the price of 22k gold.
Recently i bought a pair of earings from them and we were billed for 22k gold where as later on we found out that entire earing is not 22k (even the receipt said its 22k for the entire weight of the earing)
When we went back to check why this was done every body was super rude and cold and just wanted us to go away…they kept lying to us by saying that 750 stamp (18K) inside the earing is the design code for that earing which i could not believe at all. After being there for half an hour and not leaving that place with out the truth the supervisor said that this is how their supplier charges them so that why they are charging the public as well.
My advice would be to do check each and every part of your jewellery for a proper stamp."
,,A Tourist Destination not a Shopping mall,3.0,,"the Mustafa centre is so much hyped about, that u get into impulsive buying.
But i would strongly suggest that u compare the prices back home and then take ur buying decisions. As far as the LED/LCD Tvs are concerned ull find at least 30% minimum price difference to the prices in india, but its not the same for all the products."
,,"Cheap, inexpensive, cheap",4.0,,"Don't expect good customer service, if you want one, shop at one of the orchard shopping malls.

There are 2 advantages of this mall over the others. First, it's open 24 hrs so you may squeeze shopping here even at night. Second is the price. This is the best place to buy key chains, t-shirts and other souvenir items. The designs could be a little outdated if you're going to compare to the ones available at the other souvenir shops.. but hey even you wouldn't know this if not pointed out by sellers from other places. It's also good to buy perfumes here. They have so many stocks of almost all the popular brands.. They have special sale like buy 1 for 90, but buy 2 for only 150. Others told me that these are counterfeit but I don't think so. Singapore is very strict with fake items. This mall should have been raided ages ago if these are fakes!

By the way, disadvantage?! Don't use their loo!!"
,,Mostafa centre is full of indian worker .,2.0,,"from my experience , all sells assistant they dont know how to serve a customer or how to talk with customer on the phone specially the indian manager in charge of gold section."
,,Place for impulsive buying,2.0,,"Do not shop at mustafa center. The people of mustafa were not so kind and they always had a stoned face. And especially when we are looking around in the gold and silver sections they not that good that they were literally ill treating us by speaking in front of us that "" They will not buy, why they are asking for the price"". We cannot buy all the things we see. And recently we bought a silver anklet for my daughter and after 2 days only we came to know that it was total cheating.. the price is doubled and we could not realise it since we were in a hurry. Gonna ask for that today.. will again give a review about their reaction to this.."
,,Excellent place to buy anything and everything,5.0,,"Its open hours and quite near to Farrer Park MRT and very near to city square mall.

All sorts of vegetables, dresses, gold necklaces from different countries, silver, clock, Milk, electronic items, TV, Fridge, cakes, Pizzas, cosmeticsdand many more things.

Prices are also very genuine.

Avoid going satuday and sunday because its always over crowed. best timings are week days from mid night to afternoon time."
,,My dumbest decision ever,1.0,,"People says Mustafa Center is the best place to buy souvenir in Singapore because they have cheapest price. And they're wrong.
I spent about Sin$700 in Musfata and I realized it was my dumbest decision ever since I found Chinatown has 1/3 or 1/2 price than Mustafa. Screw me.
The store was so crowded and I was felt very sorry to my young boy to brought him to the store. As the big store they didnt put any chairs for costumer to sit.
Okay fine, they have many stuffs in one roof. But if you have time to explore another place to buy stuffs with competitive/cheap price, avoid Mustafa."
,,Not everyone's cup of chai,3.0,,"I live in Singapore. I venture to Mustafa a few times a year. I go there for the atmosphere and the frenetic energy that the place gives out. I go there to marvel at the fake goods and the sheer number of things on sale. Do I bring my kids? Noooooooo.
It's one of those places you go to feel that you are no longer in clean orderly Singapore. Go in the weekends to really soak up the humanity (& humidity;) Things there are cheap but not rock bottom. Temper your expectations.
An interesting fact: they have a booth there that handles processing of visa to India. It's probably faster than going to the Indian embassy. Opening hours? No idea. You are in Mustafa ..... Singapore norms don't apply. And no, there is no phone number to call to enquire."
,,Mustafa - still relevant inspite of all the new malls,5.0,,"A visit to Mustafa is still relevant inspite of all the new swanky up market malls opened in Singapore. You get everything under one roof, at the right price."
,,Get lost,5.0,,"Have you arrived from another continent, are still jet lagged and find yourself awake at night with better thing to do? All your problems have been solved with Mustafa.
Not only in open 24/7 you can find pretty much everything is this crazy mall/supermarket/jewerly place/pharmacy/etc etc.
Don't miss the rice session
Don't miss the chocolate session
Best thing about Mustafa? You will find not only what you need but also what you DON'T need
Moreover yo ucan find the same thing on diferent buildings and diferent floors
While price can be better than anywhere in the Island be careful that not everything you find here is cheaper than elsewhere"
,,"Fabulous, you'll shop like crazy",5.0,,"Huge department store, full of everything Indian you look for. Therefore. cosmetics, food, clothes, weird things, spices. Good prices, very crowded, you'll get pleasantly lost."
,,More like a bargain barn than a department store,4.0,,"Let me start by saying I have never seen so many products jammed into the one store. You really have to know what you want and in some cases be prepared to rummage through the shelves to find it. There are no attractive displays to catch your eye, but if you look beyond the clutter you will find many well known and popular brands from watches and electrical appliances to toiletries, sports gear and home wares.

The prices of the products you do find tend to be lower than average for the big name brands.

It is the store that never sleeps and is open 24 hours.

If you are travelling by public transport the store is a short walk from Farrer Park (NE8) MRT station."
,,Biggest market ever,5.0,,"Your eyes will itchy to buy all goods inside this huge market, there are so many variant and you will very tired if you try to walk around the whole market.."
,,Possibly everything you need under one roof,3.0,,"Mustafa Center is a twin building 4 storey shopping mecca that carries possibly anything and everything you need.Electronics, Jewelry, toiletries, bags, shoes, clothes, groceries, chocolates, souvenirs, name it and they probably have it. People say items here are cheap but i say...shop around. Not everything here is cheaper compared to others, as basic as pringles, the local grocery store near my hotel was cheaper. But still, for the hard to find stuff and really old brands, they still have it here."
,,Wud never visit again,2.0,,Hyped for no reason at all! We had heard so much about this place before going ther. But it was such a disappointment. As already mentioned by so many ppl all over the net about the toilets being dissasterous no toilet papers as usual.. And rude vry rude staff. Will rather pay extra for shopping rather than goin ther again.
,,Electrical items are low quality,1.0,,I am a local and was patronising this store so blindly until i realised that most electricals i buy there are either outdated models or won't last after the 1 year guarantee period. i was blinded by the price. i was alerted by a friend of mine who started to work there. i started to patronise other store like harvey norman where they even offered extended warranties for cameras. i tried gain city they even offered 5 years warranty for my mitsubishi fridge. I really regretted going to mustafa and i even started to get used to changing my appliances every other year and i just thought that the quality of the production nowadays has become worse. I will never step inside there for electricals. NO WAY. The staff are the worst. They are demoralised because of the pay there as they don't have any incentives based on sales or customer satisfaction. Complaints will fall on deaf ears. As for foodstuffs beware of expired items.
,,Awesome shopping,4.0,,"This is well worth a visit , excellent displays of men's shoes , luggage and bags, electronics, it's a well stocked department store with good quality products at reasonable prices."
,,Crammed with people but plenty to see and buy,3.0,,"crammed with people so avoid Sunday or you could suffer claustrophobia as the aisles are small and crammed with local and non-local Indian shoppers..

Every possible item of Indian food-stuffs outside India are available here.

Outside Mustafa are eateries all over the place so can sit in the humid air and watch millions of other hungry shoppers with stuffed trolleys heave past.

It sells many other goods too -not just foods. Open all day and night."
,,Trash and Treasure...,4.0,,"... but they are all mixed up together. There is just so much STUFF in this 24 hour shopping centre in Little India. Toilets stunk, didn't venture in. Buy everything from biscuits to bathmats to bananas to beach balls in this chaotic multi storey complex, then wander out and grab some cheap and delicious Indian food."
,,everything & anything,4.0,,u can find almost everything here. from stethoscopes to pans & plates! a place to go if u have no where to go after 10pm. it's a busy place at day time. its open 24/7!
,,Must go if visiting Singapore,3.0,,"It's very different from the major malls and departmental stores in Singapore. Nothing glamorous, no high-end branded goods and also no toilet paper in the toilets.

The place is huge. Imagine 3 x Macy's NY with 1/3 the walking space. It sells everything from gold to toys. Has travel and VISA services, hotel, a cafe and restaurant. And I think the Pharmacists are there 24 hours too. Which is a major plus.

It has 3 wings and it's really complex. That's part of the fun. You squeeze through narrow asles and start discovering things you didn't know you need. Prices of things are not always cheaper but not likely to be way pricier than most shops.

There's always a large crowd so it's not comfortable for children and there's no space to push a stroller through. Head to the new wing where the asles are just a little wider. But the goods are not as varied here. The middle wing is a good bet for goods as i has everything but just as many people too.

Best time to visit is 12am-7am if you need some space."
,,Shopping.,5.0,,"I found very good quality scaves and stoles here. We picked up nuts chocolates, biscuits bags clothes like there is no tomorrow. You get very good exchange rates for Indian rupees. Just that the place is crowded."
,,Mustafa Center Singapore,5.0,,"Can I just say that Mustafa's is AWESOME! Arriving in Singapore, getting to hotel, unpacking, well everything done.......guess what? Time to shop! Believe me when you need something that you didn't even know you needed.......Mustafa's has it. Start on the top floor (think it's 4th), there is fabric that will take your breath it is so beautiful. Mostly sold for sari's, but makes beautiful pillows, table runners etc. Each floor has great bargains and unusual items. The grocery market is my favorite floor. I've never seen so many different types of curry, rice, teas, you need it, it's there. The fresh veggies and fruit choices are great. Mangosteen, jackfruit, ginger, longbeans............the list goes on. If ever in Singapore.....it's an experience you won't forget."
,,This place has everything you don't want and a few you do,4.0,,"We headed down to Mustafa's on a Saturday night with a couple of friends that live in Singapore. The new to grab a basket when you walk in, even if you are just going for a look. You are bound to come across something you need. And sure enough, we all did.
Saturday night seemed crazy. People everywhere buying small trolleys of food. The place seems to go on and on. We made it our mission to find the roof top restaurant which took some finding.
Is it the cheapest place in Singapore to buy a map of Brisbane, a safe, a hand of bananas and a pair of crutches? I don't know but it sure was a novel way to spend a coouple of hours."
,,"Almost everything are here, come early morning or late night",4.0,,"The place is a 24 hour, huuuge shopping center..
Best for shopping electronics, groceries and perhaps souvenirs for family and friends back home

Also there is a money changer at the left side of the building, with a good exchange rates too.
Over the years, Mustafa Center expands a lot, practically almost occupies one side of the whole Syed Alwi road itself

the best time to visit here is very early in the morning or late night. (come here at 2am, and definitely you will have the place for yourself, and notice some of the employees fell asleep)
We visit the place around 7am and the place is still empty, so fun to browse rather than in the afternoon where you will have to fought your way around the crowds

Is it cheaper than your country? perhaps, not all of them
Is it the cheapest around singapore? well... I've seen some (not all) stuffs at singapore's Cold Storage have the same price."
,,Shopping spree!!,4.0,,"Great place to shop for gadgets, accessories, clothes and other stuff!! The nice thing about this place for tourists, too, is that you are able to accumulate all of your purchase receipts and get your GST refund in one go! That is making your shopping really flexible and much more worth it!! Definitely coming back here whenever I go back to Singapore!!"
,,Everything you need and more.,4.0,,This place have all the things you need plus many more. I enjoyed window shopping here and the prices are very competitive I must say. It is open round the clock and it is best to go on a weekday to avoid the massive crowd.
,,"Your kidding, it's open 24 hours!!!",4.0,,"Need to do some late night shopping, you got it, this shopping mall is open 24 hours! It has everything you'll need. A few blocks from the MRT."
,,24 hour shopping,4.0,,"Visited Mustafa twice this week & got hopelessly lost. A confusing, huge dept.store that has most things that you could need in life. Very crowded, very little signage and can be claustrophobic. items are priced competitively, choices are many . The fittings rooms are grubby and you must carry your own toilet paper. It was a fun experience but I couldn't do it again."
,,Crazy shopping place.... sleep les small.,4.0,,I have literally seen this place growing for the last 18 years and it has grown big like a whale from a shark... its I think the only mall which is opened 24 hours in this region. Unbelievable amount of people flock here and prices are quite reasonable. Its a good place to buy gold chains (this is not for the Tiffany fans). Electronics is also quite good.
,,Don't Go There If You Have To Use The Bathrooms,1.0,,"We were in Singpore for Chinese New Year. The first time we went to Mustafa when my wife went to use the bathroom there was NO toilet paper. So we walked to another part of the store and found another bathroom that had toilet paper. Then a week later when we visited Mustafa again and there was NO toilet paper period. There also was no toilet paper in the men's bathroom. When my wife nicely asked one of the bathroom attendants about the toilet paper the attendant said ""SO what, you can buy toilet paper in the grocery department if you want.""

We've been telling our friends and relatives that they should avoid Mustafa. We've found many items for much less at other stores in Singapore. The only good thing about Mustafa is if you need to buy many different items...they have them all in one place but you probably will pay more. REMEMBER TO BRING YOUR OWN TOILET PAPER."
,,enormous stock and well priced,4.0,,"The first time we entered this centre, we could not believe the amount of stock this centre carried and at reasonable prices. Obviously this is the centre where a lot of locals come as it was busy and lot of people buying. We did not see anyrhing like this anywhere else.The only problem I can see, is if a fire would break out, this building will be a death trap"
,,Give it a miss,1.0,,"I would not go again to this 24 hour shopping centre. The entire place smells and sells rubbish products, I never feel someone will snatch my bag in Singapore, I always feel safe but not in this place. It's claustrophobic and simple not worth it."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Very interesting place - like the general dealers of long ago, just MUCH bigger. Like a giant supermarket spread over 4+ floors. Prices are OK - and of course, remember, you get what you pay for. Busy, crowded - if you suffer from claustrophobia, best stay away. Don't try rushing it - this is a BIG store, with lots and lots of stuff"
,,"Bustling, mad, fun",4.0,,"I dived into this store and was quickly submersed in the hubbub. So many jam packed shelves and gear. While it's not Orchard Road, it beats it hands down on atmosphere! Give it a try if you can bear the bustle."
,,I SAW MINI INDIA,5.0,,"after seeing whole singapore malls finally i visited Mustafa, man i can't believe it i get all the item which is available in INDIA, more over here you can all brand of india. for example if you take Gee, Gee companies of Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Ahmadabad, Chennai etc indian place products are available here..
More over 98% of staff are INDIAN..
Happy to see that
if you really need to shop i better advice to spare at-least 4 to 5 hours"
,,Love it,5.0,,"Love every second i was in here. I like the atmosphere, the cheap prices, everything is here, from electronic to food, some you can find in your iwn country, some not. Really cool place, the people is friendly and helpful. Cool prices"
,,Mustafa's Swiss Polo luggage is a gyp,1.0,,I bought a 'polycarbonate' type of wheeled suitcase and brought it home - to discover that I cannot set the lock. No wonder there were not labels and tags on the item when I bought it - and no sales person to help. So I am going to take it back tonight or tomorrow.
,,A must for anyone who love curries!,4.0,,Excellent meal starting at SG$9-13. We ordered 4 different meals and enjoyed all of them! I do personally recommend the butter chicken which literally melts in your mouth.
,,Positively madness!,4.0,,"This is a 24 hour, one-stop shop for almost everything under the sun. Driving and parking in the area is an issue due to the road works in that area. Would not advise bringing kids there - extremely stroller unfriendly! Escalators are not wide, so you may have to be careful. Navigating the place is quite a maze.

If you're buying in bulk, do take note that you might get a discount off the sticker price. My basket was filled with 20 pcs of the same items due to friends placing everything in 1 basket, and the bill indicated a lower price even though we took 20 separate pieces of the same item (vs the item in bulk packaging)."
,,pretty bad..,2.0,,"Pros:
1) For Indians, a big supermarket...almost all food/other items available.
2) One of the better foreign exchange rates

Cons:
1) Bad quality, especially of food items.
2) Crowded.
3) Narrow walkway.
4) Beware of taking the heavily discounted items, expiry date will be quite near."
,,Busy large selection fair prices.,4.0,,"When everywhere else was closed on the Monday after Chinese New Year this shopping center was open and busy. Great department selection, crammed if you don't like tight spaces and crowds then not for you. I would go back again felt I got value for money."
,,Big but Nothing Special,3.0,,"We saw Anthony Boudain go here on The Travel Channel and it looked interesting so we thought we should check it out. It really wasn't worth the trouble. Yes, it was very large- 5 or 6 levels covering an entire city block, but who needs to buy groceries or housewares when you are on vacation? They did have a very large watch and and jewelry department- so large as to be overwhelming. Clothes, yes, but more for the locals. Cheap souvenirs, but probably nothing you couldn't get for the same price at Lucky Plaza on Orchard Road. A lot of the high end departments, such as the watch department, seemed to cater to export sales. Prices for watches didn't seem that special to me, but I must confess I didn't find the prices anywhere in Singapore to be a bargain. As some reviews have stated, a local Wal-Mart is a good way to describe the store- both in its size and in the general quality of the goods.

I would also have to add that I thought the location was a bit out of the way. You would have to figure out how to get your purchases back to your hotel (assuming you are not a local or renting a car.) Now I can say that I have been where Anthony Bourdain went, but I have to say that I am more of an Orchard Road kind of shopper.

One last note- the bathrooms do not have toilet paper in them Not a square to spare. My wife was lucky that I was waiting outside when she went to use the toilet. I heard her cry out for help, and was able to find a toilet paper vending machine dispenser outside the entrance to the restrooms and get some to her. I suppose you are expected to buy it on the way in."
,,Big & Good Shopping Stop,4.0,,"Everything & anything you need..this is the place you'll find it....cosmetics, electronics, chocolates, forex, jewellery, etc. etc, & the Indian food outside it is a luxury for all the Indians....Shop Eat & Celebrate indeed."
,,If you need anything that you dont find this is the place . Luggage for example,4.0,,"It is a huge market place like wall-mart, but more likely bazaar. I think it is not a touristic place but it is a good market for tourist's needs. If you need extra luggage like us , this is the place to go. Samsonite, Delcey, Pierre Cardin, American Tourist what ever u can think of , you can find it in here at very reasonable prices. Also you can get your tax refund , just bring your passport and tell the cassier you want tax refund and they will direct you to the basement where you will take your tax refund receipt which you will show at the airport and get tax refund. It is open 24/7 by the way . And it is not just luggage ofcource anything you want just name it, you can find it here.
Other then that ,I think it is a very colourful place that you can see any type of people especially from locals."
,,Multicultural Walmart + Department store selling EVERYTHING,4.0,,"If you run out of things to see / do in Singapore, Mustafa Centre is a pretty cool place to kill some time. Essentially, the Mustafa Centre is a giant supermarket-department store selling everything that you can possibly imagine: groceries / fashion / insurance / jewellery / *cars* / electronics etc. etc. While this place is almost exclusively frequented by the local Indian / Tamil communities, the department store also features an amazing variety of dry goods / beverages / snacks and other grocery items, mostly imported from North America / Australia / Europe / India / Indonesia / Malaysia / China etc.

I'd say a visit to Mustafa Centre is a fun cultural journey: take a look at what kind of biscuits and sodas do people from different countries consume (and be adventurous to try them!), immerse yourself into a different ""shopper's culture"" where being pushed around by others behind you seems to be a socially accepted practice."
,,So so...,3.0,,"I have been to Mustafa Centre on numerous occasions and I always got so annoyed...
Most of the centre is quite dark inside, aisles are narrow.. And people passing by often hit/push without saying sorry.
It is open 24/7, which is great, and also you can find inside practically everything. I usually get chocolates, baking needs, and some vitamin supplements."
,,Worse service encounted,1.0,,"When bought a electronic piano the staff told me within a week i could do a one to one exchange but on the 3rd day when i wanted a one to one exchange due to the last note has no sound i was given a bad service by this indian mustafa staff.Refuse to exchange when i could produce the receipt ,on top of that his attitude was really bad n no solution was given.Photos was taken for his bad service as well as the model of the piano.I saw two numbers of the same pianos was sending for service,could it be after service they re-sell it to customers again n that is also the reason why the piano i bought was found faulty as well.Totally horrible experience.Now i believe what the rumours outside,never buy any electric items from mustafa."
,,Paradise of shopping,4.0,,"Lots to shop, don't know where to start where to end. Prices are cheap comparatively. There are two sections, one on the main road, mainly this part is crowded, the other one just behind it, lesser crowd but you get same stuff and its connected through the upper floors as well."
,,A place for locals - NOT tourists,4.0,,"Mustafa is like Singapore's Walmart. I would not call it a tourist attraction, unless you need something in the middle of the night, as it is open 24 hours.

For locals, however, it's great. I find stuff here that I can't find anywhere else in Singapore, and it's reasonably priced."
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,"This place has everything that you can't find anywhere else in Singapore.There are all prices, all brands...For the food it's incredible too!There are spices, chocolates (big brand like Lindt...), cakes and everything!!!"
,,best place of shopping in singapore,5.0,,mustafa shopping centre is at little india area in singapore it is easily acessible through car /bus or you can have MRT[train ] station is at 5 minutes walk you can buy good range of products at a very resonable prices
,,Shopping,5.0,,Mustafa is my favourite shopping place in Singapore. You can buy any thing here. Plus it had many Indian Restaurants around there.
,,Big Shopping Mall,3.0,,"Mustafa Shopping Complex remains opened 24 hours. A big shopping complex but you will see crowded with local people not a tourist attraction. More and more locals do shopping in this complex for daily needs as it has every thing ( clothes, crockery, large variety of bags/ trolleys, toys, choclates, electronics and even gold) and ranges from cheap to very high.

If you are stating near by this shopping complex then must visit place otherwise you can easily ignore.

The one more plus point for every tourist is that you will get the bill for every purchase and your tax will be returned back on airport whatever you purchase from this shopping mall."
,,Disappointed after reading reviews...,1.0,,"first of all i assume that everyone saying this place is good must be locals or people older than myself. as a tourist reading this i was expecting either a bazaar or a mall type of thing to be disappoint by it being 2 floors of carpark, 2 floors of supermarket and 1 floor of clothes that are not for younger more style focused individuals, which is fine, but disappointing when after reading good reviews to then travel out to it, i probably spent 5 mins there. if after a younger more lively shopping experience try bugis street markets"
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"I would rate mustafa centre as an average mall, only thing special is it's open 24 hrs. It's located in sarangoon plaza at end of little india. The mall building seems old and is cramped with goods. You can get everything here right from electronics, gold , Indian house hold goods, souvenirs.
I found rates cheaper compared to other malls in Singapore but is still costly as you can get all those stuff selling their at half price in india.
Just by chocolates as they have huge variety."
,,24 hours,3.0,,"Mustafa is open 24 hours that's a plus point for shoppers.It has a lot of stuff ranging from clothes ,shoes,bag's ,provisions,video CD's and stationary ,basically you can find everything under one roof .Please survey what do you actually want as some things are cheaper and worth buying like certain branded sports goods,household items and groceries ,but the rest are either the same or more pricey than normal shopping malls in Singapore .
But be aware that the things are quite stacked up high,messy and jumbled up so navigating in the tight walkways could be quite a challenge if you are in a wheelchair or bringing kids in strollers .
Be careful of the gold do ask the grade of it weather it is 916 grade ,as an avid gold buyer I notice that it is mixed grade .
Food wise it's Asian food which includes lots of curry and rice with meat.
Pretty easy to get there by MRT just stop at Farrer Park ,walk against traffic along Seranggon Road and turn left onto Jalan Sted Alwi road and you will see the blue building which is the first Mustafa you can cut through it to get to the new building at the back of iteasily."
,,You could spend a day in this place,5.0,,Everything under one roof - watches jewellery electronics cameras pens sportswear glasses the list goes on. Good brand names at good prices!
,,Gold buyers beware,1.0,,"Mustafa always calculates gold price from their published price/gram. Here is how they fool everyone. Gold price all over the world is based on Troy Ounce which is 31.10 grams. This is not anyone can deny. The other type of ounce is 28.35 grams which has nothing to do with gold or silver standards. Mustafa claims their 24k gold price matches that of online gold price determined by the world market. They publish the per ounce price but calculate the gram price by dividing the price by 28.35 rather than 31.10. This nets them almost 10% higher per gram price. Here is how you can confirm this. Ask for the 1 ounce Austrian or Australian or Canadian or American Eagle gold coins. They are usually exactly around 31.10 grams and they are made by the respective governments. When you try to buy this coin you will see their ounce price is 10% higher than the online price. Dont be fooled, do your math.

I visit them once or twice every year for the last 15 years when I pass through Singapore, spend about an hour or two in the store. This year I happened to stay in Singapore for a week. My experience is the staff have zero concept of customer service, all they do is point fingers when you ask for something.

But you do get almost ""everything"" in this store, so it is a good place to buy stuffs without a doubt. But just dont expect any help. And their elevators, escalators, stair cases must have been designed by drunkards. Every new building they build have this part completely gone awry, perhaps they do this to confuse you with your way around, so you go in endless circles and pick up unwanted stuffs while trying to find your way around the store."
,,"Busy, crowded but possibly worth a visit.",3.0,,"Visited on a Saturday afternoon for three hours. The place was busy and the narrow aisles didn't leave much room to move around. However, there is a huge range of products and Mustafa's is the place to go if you would like to do all of your shopping under one roof. I found the prices of DVDs to be quite high compared to Australia."
,,Amazing Shopping Experience,4.0,,This 24hr shopping centre literally sells everything! We had a great time exploring the centre and will definitely visit next time we are in Singapore.
,,I am a visitor from USA and was impressed,5.0,,"Mustafa- is a very unique store that meets the demand of all tastes -the store is bigger than Super Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco stores. Prices are reasonable and personnel willing to help you.
The store with passage of time will continue to sort out and meet consumer demands and expectations. Congratulations for Mustafa's vision."
,,ONLY HYPED UP !!!,2.0,,"Being at Singapore and as a Indian you get to here about this place every now and then so decide to visit this.But to my disappointment this place was cramped up like i was in some shady shop with jam packed crowd. Never had the feeling of being in a mall, no doubt they got huge stocks of stuff but to be honest i doubt about the authenticity of the the things here. I might be wrong too but that's the impression i had after looking at the stuff like clothes,shoes etc..First & last visit to Mustafa i say..."
,,So many things under one roof,5.0,,"This place is open 24 hours and houses everything from spices to Swiss watches, perfumes to pest control items. It's best to see prices here first before going to Orchard Rd, one can always come back here literally at anytime! Parking is a pain though, and is a bit way off MRT lines but plenty of taxis available at most times."
,,A different side of Singapore,5.0,,"If you are used to the clean, efficient Singapore, and expect Mustafa Center to be the same, then you would be wrong. This place is open 24 hours and has pretty much everything you need ranging from vitamins, off the counter medications, cosmetics, hair and face products, DVDs, music, clothes, electronics, books, stationery, watches, hotel, restaurant, cafe and the list goes on and on. It is definitely not the most organized place and you will have to search for the things you want . The staff is also not exactly the friendliest but I think all these things give Mustafa Center the special charm that it has. My husband is from the United States and absolutely love Mustafa Center. I have also brought several foreign friends to Mustafa Center and they are always intrigued by it. If you are not afraid of crowds, come by on a Saturday or Sunday evening. This entire place is filled with Indians and is definitely an experience you will never forget."
,,Everything to be found here...,4.0,,"This is one place that you can shop 24hrs a day, anyday in singapore, air-conditioned. From basic necessaties like sugar, salt and rice to luxury items like gold and diamond jewelleries to Tah Hueur watches, all can be found under one roof. The store is big enough for one to spend 3 hrs walking in it. As for the prices, some things are cheap while some are not. Apparently the electrical items here like the TV console are cheaper with the number of patrons exiting the store with one as evidence."
,,"Very big, lots of stock but not great",4.0,,"Visited when I went to Singapore in November 2012. The place is huge, has everything you want and lots of stock too. Prices too are good. But unlike the rest of Singapore, it is not as clean, is crowded and we found the staff not very helpful. More typical of an Indian store, a bit unfortunate. Ended up buying a bad, lots of chocolates and some watches. Stuff is genuine and chocolates variety was huge. However it is the ambiance and the staff that are a letdown to an extent. Would give it a rating between average and very good. But should see if you need to shop. Can get everything in single place."
,,I love this shop!!,5.0,,"So huge, so reasonable and so interesting. It seems like you can find everything available on this planet. Staffs are very friendly and helpful as well. You can enjoy shopping even late at night."
,,Very Large Shopping Center - Nothing More,3.0,,"This is an extremely large shopping center that gets very crowded. If you have been to a Wal-mart in the US, then multiply the offerings by 10 and you have Mufstafa.

My recommendation, don't make a special trip just for this, but if you are in Little India, go ahead and stop by and knock it off your list.

In regards to prices, I didn't buy anything. I did look at the souvenir area but the prices are higher than the street vendors in China Town or Little India."
,,so big.. they sell everything,5.0,,"really they sell everything. After splurging on a few priced designer items, shopping at Mustafa is an excellent and cost effective way to get souvenirs for all the folks back home"
,,Terrifying in its breadth of STUFF,3.0,,"I visited on the tip of a friend, who mentioned it was a great place to pick up souvenirs. But Mustafa Centre is so huge I never found the souvenirs! It is a great destination - there is everything from washing machines to TVs to cans of Coke to shoes to boxes of cereal to all types of spices - but for a novice it is very difficult to figure out where everything is! There is little signage and no maps. But if you are in Little India, definitely stop by, because even if you don't find what you went there for, you won't leave empty handed."
,,Terrible,1.0,,"So many rude sales staff . They don't answer questions , they are all busy playing with their phones or talking amongst themselves . Went in to buy a lens and was served by one of the rudest people I have ever met , left and went back 12 hrs later to find the same person still working AND just as RUDE !!!"
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Mustafa is a one stop shop, where you can get all products.... electrical,electronics,gift items,gold jewellery,provisions,chocolates,eatables,drinks,dresses,etc.....

Its a big shop which is not at all possible to be completed in a day.... It has 6 floors of shopping including 2 floors in basement and 3 storeys for carpark. Also a roof top restaurant is available where we can get asian foods."
,,One Stop Shopping Centre,3.0,,"You will find a wide variety of goods from souvenirs, food, to electronics. Just selecting carefully and patiently cause sometimes If You're lucky You will find the same things with lower price or better quality, like t shirt, souvenir, etc. Don't expect too much with the restroom, a bit dirty n smelly. In addition, You need to bring tissue or wet tissue, cause You have to insert the coin to get a tissue. If you have much time and want to get souvenirs with the lower price, you need to go to Bugis market or China Town."
,,SHOPPING AT ITS BEST,4.0,,It was a great shopping experience at mustafa .We spent about 04 to 05 hours inside this gigantic mall.you can buy all in one place.further you can go to the GST refund counter with your pass port and get 7% gst refund for the total cost you spend as a visitor to Singapore. Quality of the goods are worth even though the price is bit high.
,,Great for new arrivals,4.0,,"If you have recently moved to the country, Mustafa is a great one-stop-shop for all your appliance and household needs. (I know that sounds like a cheesy ad, but it's true.) Prices are good, and the selection is awesome. Staff are difficult to identify because they don't wear uniforms, but you can usually tell who's working and who's shopping (and if not just ask). Shopping here during non-peak hours is recommended. The store is open 24-hours a day, so you can shop whenever your jet lag has you up. Avoid shopping on Sundays, when the store is at its busiest."
,,No need to go anywhere else!!,5.0,,"This place is awesome. You don't have to go anywhere else to do shopping (except for electronics for which I prefer Naranjan Shop nearby). It has everything available in this mall at a reasonable price. I went there to shop gifts for my family from singapore and was overwhelmed to see the varieties and things available. For Non-Sg residents, you could also take a GST refund slip in no time."
,,For the shopaholics and the insomniacs (like me),4.0,,"We were staying at The Perak Hotel in little India and were told that there was a very big,24 hours mall nearby,so around 3am,with the excuse that i couldn`t sleep,got dressed again,left my husband and went straight to The Mustafa Centre,it was indeed very close the hotel,maybe around 10minutes walk,very safe environment and the Centre was packed with families,tourists and workers...It is not the most sophisticated and classy place to shop in Singapore but it surely sells almost everything...It was a nice experience to mingle among crowds of fellow shopaholics and insomniacs like me!!!There should be a place like that in every big city for people like us!"
,,Wholesale shopping,4.0,,"It is a fantastic place as you can find anything and everything in this place though not necessarily cheaper than the supermarkets. The fresh produce is surprisingly very fresh - fresher than some of the supermarkets.

It is a massively large place so to cover the whole centre in 1 day is impossible. After all the walking you can enjoy the delicious food at the numerous shops surrounding the centre.

Mustafa is 2 mins walk from Farrer Park MRT station"
,,a 24 hour shopping mall,3.0,,anything you need in 1 roof. once you get tired and hungry with your shopping meals and snacks are also available 24 hours. I like there rice cooked with coconut milk @ S$4.50/meal surely you'll get full and satisfied.
,,Organzied Chaos,4.0,,"Had to agree with any contributor that Mustafa Centre can be described as 'organized chaos'. But you'll love it.

It has everything under one roof (which department store would have real gold and watches) though everything is spilled into a few adjourning building. And I believed the place will keep expanding every few years if the owners have their way.

Was there just a few days ago to look for cheap makeup ""Three Beauties"" for stage use.

Heard that Mustafa is the place to go if you want to exchange foreign currencies to middle east countries.

Prices seem to have increased slightly after it started operating 24hrs, but still cheap compared to the usual supermarkets.

They always lock shopping bags with cable ties. Sometimes the security guards may request for your personal bag (non-handbags) to be cable-tied as well.

Tips:
1) Don't go on a Sunday or public holiday. It's a nightmare.
2) Check the expiry date of perishable products.
3) Have lots of time. It takes time to look through every shelf through out the building
4) Don't feel bad about pushing your way through the crowd
5) There's a storage counter if you are carrying big bags. It's better to put it at their temporary storage because the passage ways are narrow, you won't want to knock things down."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"On our last day in Singapore we were looking for a place where we could shop for souvenirs that we could bring home. We were told that Mustafa Center is good for shopping if you are on a budget.

Mustafa Center was just a few blocks away from our hotel in Jalan Besar. So early morning we walked to Mustafa Center, since we were looking for spices and Sambal that we could bring home, we directly went up to the grocery. To our surprise, Mustafa Center has the widest array of spices.

After getting our spice and sambal fix, we went to look for souvenirs. Mustafa Center has a lot of boxes of Merlion chocolates and its cheap! I was on a high on chocolate deals! Next we went to look for souvenir shirts, and Mustafa has a lot of it! They also have all sort of gift and souvenir items that you can take home.

They will also give tourists the receipts for GST refund. If I will be back in Singapore I will definitely go back to Mustafa to shop for chocolates and souvenirs."
,,Old fashioned department store,4.0,,"Looking for somewhere to go shopping early on a Sunday morning, the hotel doorman suggested the Mustafa Centre in the Little India section of Singapore. Mustafa Centre is open 24 hours a day. It’s an old fashioned department store, spread over a number of buildings and floors with stock piled high and narrow walkways. It was certainly a contrast to the glitz of many of the modern shopping centres in Singapore."
,,Great value excellent choice,4.0,,What can you say. This massive 24 hour 7 day a week mega centre offers everything at a great price. A must to visit if you're into shopping.
,,Chock a block,4.0,,"It's like a David Jones with really narrow isles and floor to ceiling shelving, chock a block crammed with every description of goods you would imagine.
From electrical, clothing and shoes, toys, chemist and makeup, jewellery etc and goes up and down with escalators to other floors. You can hardly move for goods and people but I bet you can find whatever you need or want in here.!"
,,Huge Shopping Centre,3.0,,"What a place! It has everything you can imagine in 6 huge floors! The clothes are not the best quality (not sure if they are real or knock offs), but half the price of Australian merchandise, i.e Nike, Puma etc There is a huge range of everything and a great market across the road. I would recommend a visit here if you get a chance, and its a 24 hour shopping complex!"
,,If you must buy some souveniers....,3.0,,"I went to Mustafa Center on a Sunday night last August and I was flabbergasted by the sheer amount of Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Nepalese workers who were in for their weekend shopping in this massive, all-under-one-roof complex. It runs 24 hours a day (yes, 24 hours a day) and they have everything from souveniers to flat screen TVs and gold. The place is huge and you need a couple of hours to cover all the departments. I’m not a person who travels to shop but I do find the chocolates selection and Singapore souvenirs are much cheaper than any other place. Lots of good Indian restaurants surrounding the place so, do not worry about getting hungry. I am not sure if this should be classified as one of the tourist attractions in Singapore, but if you are obligated to pick up some souvenirs or one of those cheeky Singapore-is-a-fine-country T-shirt, don’t go elsewhere."
,,this place is incredible..,4.0,,"Went here with my wife to look for spices and was incredibly amazed with the size of this place!! They pretty much had everything in the complex which goes into the basement and upper floors too.
What we saw:
Sections that sold things like, tea, sports drinks, multivitamins and health related products, supermarket groceries, beauty products like lotions, cosmetics, cameras, etc etc..
One really good thing I found too is that the foreign exchange booth, had probably one of the best exchange rates in Singapore from Foreign currency to Singaporean dollars.
Be prepared to have your bag tied up with another bag outside the entrance as they are very very strict with people shoplifting in the complex.
This place takes credit card and cash so there is not need to worry about carrying loads of cash on you as long as you have a Visa/Mastercard (probably AMEX works too)."
,,Made in Singapore super/hyper store,3.0,,"V busy, crowded but an experience to contrast w sleek swanky malls in Orchard. A one time visit place. Good place to pick up vitamins, supplements, ointments at good price. Not so great to have to meander around the nooks and aisles. The most organized place is the pharmacy which is at door 4. The rest requires lots of leg muscles to get around. Give the supermarket a miss unless you need to. There is a money changer, gold and jewelrey section, electronics. You can buy almost everything here and it's open 24hours. Eatery shops are nearby and the mrt is within 10 minute walking distance."
,,Organized chaos,3.0,,"You would expect that the frenzied, haphazard manner in which clothes are randomly 'showcased' and stacked up that prices would be considerably cheaper than Singapore's other upscale malls but in honesty the price difference is a few dollars less at Mustafa. You do however, find EVERYTHING under one roof so there is convenience in that sense as long as you have the endurance and patience to sift through a confusing store layout. Electronics, watches, shoes (for men) and chocolates are cheaper and there is quite a wide variety. You may need more than one visit to cap it all off though. The Sarangoon Plaza end of the Mustafa Centre is less busy and has the same stuff just a lot less of it."
,,Stunned to see this place,5.0,,Wow...Wow...wow...what a place for shopping. Wonderful place. There was lot of items and was not able to shop.
,,A shop with everything,4.0,,"Mustafa centre in Little India, sells everything from Electronic to toiletries to candies to grocery to cosmetics. The prices are cheaper than what you'll find outside.

This is a great place to shop. Prepare to spend a whole day and arm yourself with money or credit cards."
,,All in one stop - Beware crowded and low quality items,3.0,,"I am not a tourist who tours for shopping. So I can't see how this is a tourist attraction. Anyways, this a super-market complex where you can buy anything from watches to chocolates. This is a one stop hub for many Indians settled in Singapore to do their shopping, mainly grocery.

The advantage of shopping here is you can buy all your souvenirs, from spices to clothes, in this place. But be aware that the quality of any item is rather poor. The packed food items MAY be really old. And the chocolates MAY become stale within a month or so. It has happened occasionally for me, but not always.

The place is also rather crowded, with people and the shelfs, so if you prefer quiet shopping experiences, you should stay away from here.

Bottom line, most of the souvenirs, chocolates, spices, clothes etc can be purchased from other places in Singapore, like Fairprice outlets, Thekke market etc. With better quality and price!

P.S: I love their fresh pizzas though. For about 2$ a slice you can taste Indian-ized spicy pizza."
,,Too Good!!,5.0,,If you are at Singapore and you wanna buy truck loads of chocolates and electronics to take back home then this is the place.
,,good shopping place,4.0,,"mustafa center in singapore is 24 hrs shopping cemter,all sorts of goods available,it is very crowded on weekends money exchange available during day time.its worth visitng during singapore visit."
,,Busy messy place but i had the targetted shopping stuffs.,4.0,,"very busy and hard to relaxing shopping there but perfumes are cheap, luggage, most of stuffs are cheaper than other places. if you want to buy small souvenirs like magnet keyring chocolate should buy there."
,,Shoppers paradise,3.0,,"Hailed as astounding by Indian friends. Lots of variety, but I wasn't as thrilled as I had expected to be. At one door, security guard put a plastic tie around my bag, presumably so I couldn't shop-lift, and I had to carry my wallet separately -- annoying. I later found out there are other entrances where there is no security guard!"
,,"Cheap Place, Great Bargains",3.0,,Good place for Indians to shop in Little India. But should have ample time to explore .. Myself picked up lot of stuff when I went in September The Top Floor Restaurant offers some great cookies ;)
,,"Cheap price, cheap feeling",2.0,,"I like the fact that they offer various items and that most are priced cheaply, but I hate the fact that the shopping experience has to feel so cheap as well."
,,Just an over-hyped extra-large Hypermarket,2.0,,"This is one big hypermarket where, apart form the regular item, you get electronics, mobiles etc. It is true that you get a lot of things but then you need to have an crazy amount of patience to explore even half of store. It's insanely huge.

We told by many not to pick up nay electronics there but we decided to just take a look at the mobile. Turns out that they were costlier at Mustafa than in India. So much for the over-hyped cheap electronics!!!!

The only plus point is that it's open 24hrs. So in case of any emergency, you can go straight to Mustafa!!"
,,Big Mall,4.0,,Went for the First Time. You have a variety of things to buy at great prices. It is open 24 hours. You also have a restaurant on the Top Floor.
,,average,3.0,,i would say this place is average but if you are staying in singapore then might be this is only option for you to get indian stuff
,,Pile 'em high....,4.0,,"This is a huge shopping centre in Little India, Singapore where you can buy almost anything. Apart from electronic goods and beauty products you will find clothes, shoes, household goods, vitamins and health products and a pharmacy.
There are groceries and loads of chocolates.
The aisles are rather narrow and goods are piled high.
There is a roof top restaurant as well.
You could sort out your tax refunds on your purchases as well."
,,Great Bargains,4.0,,Went for the First Time. You have a plethora of things to buy at great prices. It is open 24 hours. You also have a restaurant on the Top Floor.
,,24*7 Mall,4.0,,Nice to visit. All type of goods available all the time. vast range for shopping geek . Must try Pizza and Cookies there :)
,,a shopping haven,4.0,,"been there twice in 1 visit to spore. this place is huuggeee..
bought a watch here, its much cheaper than everywhere else, but with no warranty and box.
after checking when returning to my country the price is cheaper in Jakarta + with box and warranty.

it is a shopping haven in singapore, you can find whatever you want to find in singapore, with a cheaper price, but beware for families with little children, the place is soo crowded and tight. So its not a comfortable place to brought pram nor stroller. kids are also advisable to get near parents because they easily to get lost within the store."
,,struggled to change baby diaper,2.0,,"When i went to mustafa, went inside the toilet to change my baby's diaper. I was awkwardlly smelling. I was very afraid to leave baby on the floor. I asked my mom to carry my baby and struggled with the things I carried. Finally changed and came out. Was very afrais about infection. Try to avaoid using mustafa toilets..."
,,Beware! Please Check Your Receipts WhileYou Are Still At Mustapa Centre,2.0,,"My friend and I went to do some grocery shopping at late evening on Friday 24/08/2012. We brought some items (16 items in total). Made my payment served by Ms. M. Was told the total amount is $96.20. My sixth sense told me that all my items would cost me less than $80.00. Total amount was paid by credit card.

After the payment was made, I stepped aside, put all the cable-tied plastic bags down and started to scan through every line. Truth enough - item No. 7 - HILLCREST TEABAGS 100’s was charged 4 times. I only brought one box costing $5.00. So total $20.00 was charged to my card (4 x $5.00 = $20.00). By the way, this teabags used to be $3.80 per box.

Asked my friend to do a double-check and found some error on the receipt. Since the counter managed by Ms. M was serving another customer, I went to another counter on the same isle that has displayed the “This Counter Is Closed” and asked the lady at that counter to counter-check my receipt. She cut off the cable tie and checked, there’s only one teabag box. Another lady came by and asked her what’s wrong. This lady asked me which counter were I being served earlier. I pointed to her to Ms. M’s counter.

I asked Ms. M why were there 4 boxes of teabag being charged, when in reality I brought only one. She looked at the receipt and said sorry and subsequently opened the cash register and returned me $15.00 (I have forgotten to ask the GST as well). I asked her what would happen if I had not checked the receipt while I am in the Supermarket area. What would happen if I have done my checking at home? Would I be able to convince the Supermarket that I only brought one instead of four? Would Mustapa Centre trust me? Hmmm…

Today’s morning (25/08/2012), I phone the hotline number 6-295-5855. It was not easy to get through. Spoke to the Manager in-charge of overcharging and told him about the above incident. Seems not interested and keep on saying yes, yes, yes, sometime it does happen, etc. I even told him that Mustapa Centre will not mind losing one customer like me… the manager has the audacity of saying YES!

The manager asked for my telephone number, saying he will return my call, but did not asked or my name!

Above incident is the second time the case of over-charging happened to me.

The first time also happened at the supermarket. I was charged $8.90 per kg for Thai Honey Mango. The actual cost was $5.90 per kg per Thai Honey Mango. $8.90 per kg was for some mango from India or Pakistan.
By the way, store prices at Mustapa Centre keeps on increasing and increasing. Brought a small plastic steam once-a-upon a time for $8.90 and I have brought 6 steamers in total for and on behalf of friends. While shopping at OG Albert, saw the same steamer for only $6.50. But now the same steam costs $9.90 at Mustapa Centre!

So be very careful when you shopped at Mustapa Centre! Please check your receipt against your goods while still at the Centre! I have been shopping at Mustapa Centre since late 1980s when it operated only one store. But lately I have cut down my trip and go there as when only necessary."
,,Shopping Mecca!,4.0,,"Well, I have read the reviews, but only visited it by coincidence after a friend took us to eat in Little India. You can find many of the American and Euro brands there, but much cheaper. Also, there is a nice selection of electronics, jewelry and food that are a small percentage of US and Euro prices.

As a side note: I found it helpful that I could buy some of the American toiletries that I couldn't find in Holland. Also, it's a great place to get inexpensive souveniers, and tokens.

There is a check point ouside to leave your bags, backpacks or lugagge, should you have them with you when you visit!"
,,Shopping Haven!!,4.0,,"Mustafa is indeed a shopping haven for tourists. You get every thing from groceries, chocolates,clothes, electronics, watches, perfumes ,cosmetcs etc here..all under one roof spanning across 5 floors. Its jam packed during weekends and never empty on weekdays. Every traveller visiting Singapore must visit this place if shopping is on your mind. Watches, shoes, perfumes are really cheap as compared with Indian rates. However you will find clothes a lot expensive here. Whenever i am in Singapore i make it a point to visit this place...no visit to this country is complete without stopping here.."
,,One-Stop Shopping,4.0,,"This place really offers everything. Medicine, snacks, fruits, electronics, jeweleries, you named it! What makes it even better is that it opens 24hr! It's really the heaven for shopaholics.

What I always do before shoppin at Mustafa Center is, I spot at things I wanna buy, record the price, and then find it here. Sometimes their price is higher, but when it is lower, it's really cheap (I found some that's only 1/3 of regular price!)

However, shop wisely!"
,,Every Tourist Must Visit,4.0,,"Everytime I visit Singapore, I must go and visit the mustafa centre. I tell all my colleagues heading off to singapore a place that they must visit. Its 24/7 and everything you can imagine so if your LCD LED TV brakes down watching soccer and need to get a new one this is where you head off to. Mobile phones are relatively cheap and wide selection. Mustafa Centre especially when its busy can be a little bit crowded but hey it all about the experience. go during the day time or 4am in the morning. Medicine to Grocery to HiFi and shoes it has it all at rock bottom prices."
,,Shopping heaven!,4.0,,"This is a huge place, open 24/7 and offers a variety of products, ranging from electronics to clothes, food, cosmetics, watches or jewelry. You can virtually find almost anything you want in this shopping center!
We bought quite a few things and found the prices to be reasonable."
,,"A unique mix of shopping center, department store and bazar",5.0,,"Ever seen 200+ different types of torches and flashlights in one place? That's just one product category that really impressed me - and there is 5 floors and several buildings stuffed with products from all over the world, not just Indian goods. Dutch chocolate, German buscuits, Italian coffee - toys, shoes, electronics etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. :-)"
,,Something Different to Orchard Road,3.0,,"It's one of those places that tourists need to go to at least once while on holidays there for the experience, if nothing else. The place is huge and being open 24 hours it's easy to find time to get there and have a good look around. We went during work hours and it wasn't too busy. Theres a bit of everything there - I really liked the rows and rows of cheap casual shoes and the watches. There wasn't too many well known perfumes there though. We were lucky enough to get good service with the staff in watches and gold section. Keep a close eye on your bag though!"
,,It's okay,3.0,,"Everything you can possibly need, you'll find at Mustafa centre at reasonable price, but, customer service is poor and quality of stuff as far as perfumes and a couple of other items are concerned do not seem to be good or genuine. However, electronics are quite good and reasonable at Mustafa. If you are claustrophobic - then Mustafa is not ideal for you as it is very crowded and goods and stocks are very cramped together - not much room to move around freely. In general, Mustafa centre is simply average."
,,No after-sales service,1.0,,"I bought a fountain pen from them. Only to find out that they gave the wrong nib size.
I returned to them but they refused to replaced it.
They asked me to seek service from distributor as all they do is only selling products.
If you wanna make a complaint. forget it. Most of the staffs do not even know where is the manager room. They just want you to go away.
I have bad experience with poor after-sales service. But hell, Mustafa doesn't even have after-sales service.
I will never shop with them again!"
,,24x7 Store to get anything under Sky; But poor Customer Service,4.0,,"We have been to Mustafa Centre for more than 20 times in the recent past five years. i.e 3-5 times per visit . This is a very big shop in two blocks, six levels (new block opened last year) open 24x7. We used to go for shopping at midnight or during office hours. You can except a huge crowd if you are visiting this shop during weekends and after office hours. They sell quality /original products (compared to what we get in India) at cheap rates. This shop belongs to an Indian and most of the customer care /sales people are from India especially from south India. They sell almost all the items under one roof; Money changer to post office, Electronics to Jewelry , Groceries to Restaurant, clothes to perfume, shoes to toys , fresh Vegetable to Meet & Fish and so on and on……!!!!

But recently, i.e in last two years, we have noticed that 90% of the Staff are ridiculous, unfriendly and irresponsible. Do not understand why the management is not taking any action though plenty of complaints are made through various levels.

Do not forget to claim your GST (For purchases more than 100 SGD per day) if you are tourist."
,,no way we are not going to mustafa,5.0,,today again to mustafa centre everything under one roof fantastic.today by mrt to farrerpark and a few minutes later we are there.
,,"Average service, decent food, fraudulent promotions",3.0,,"Mustafa center in Singapore is a one stop shop for everything one wants to buy. Syed Alwi road is filled with Indian restaurants trying to capitalize on the (mostly Indian) crowd visiting here. No wonder, Mustafa center themselves opened their own restaurant.

My friends & I had been to Mustafa center for some shopping and after seeing some posters that the Ramadan Buffet is available for 13.90 Nett, we decided to try it out as it seemed to be value for money.

The food was nice with almost 70% of the items in the buffet being vegetarian.
The biggest shock was when we received the receipt, the cost of the buffet was 19.90 instead of the promoted 13.90 dollars. We were told that the 13.90 promotion is only from 7-8 PM and the regular price is 19.90 SGD after 8 PM.
This is not mentioned even as (*terms and conditions apply) in the promotional posters found around Mustafa center.

Also, there is a 10% service charge for non-existent service."
,,Hate to go to mustafa,1.0,,"Staffs( two Chinese woman ) in bangle jewel section in basement 1 on eve of july 30 were not showing us the designs. If asked to show they either show their face or raise Thier voice , which makes us a bit reluctant to see further. Though we got the bangle finally , it wasn't a happy shopping at mustafa. each time after they show a design , they will go and sit in a chair , so we ve to cal them again for showing next piece of jewel. That staff is telling us to come tomo to buy, telling that we can get get jewels only till 1 am, so better come tomo and get jewels ( me and my wife went by 11 pm)

Many staffs in jewel section doesn't respond immediately and they look as if a day tired to show us. The small little jewel ships are thousand times better than this mustafa. Respecting customers is most important, which is totally lacking in mustafa.

The staffs behave as if we are getting things for free. In sections lik dress, groceries it's very hard to find a staff, they ll be crowding at one place and chit chat or sit with a phone and smsing in
It.

But some staff ( hardly 1 in 100) are good. The devotion they show in job is getting diluted because of other incompetent staffs."
,,Best Store in The Singapore,4.0,,"Its one of the best store in Singapore and the main reason is that its only 24 hour open store in the Singapore city. the store has four to five floors and has two to three buildings that makes it huge and it serves the all the needful and necessary items under the one roof. We have bought the variety of chocolates, some glossary, Ladies purses and some perfumes and some pain killer oils. Overall its good store to buy items of Singapore."
,,Everything you need available under one roof,2.0,,Sorry to read the poor reviews dates in 2006-08. But there had been lots of improvement. Was there with my daughter just three months back for a second time and spent almost 3 hours there. So much to see and wish could have more $$ Ti buy everything I saw. Finally purchased a set of high power torchlights for less than $30 and some stationary for my girl. Would go back again as it is really a great place to browse all the gadgets at a very reasonable price.
,,Not enough train to handle customer,3.0,,Incident happen at medical equipment one of the mustafa staff not helpful and unapproachable but instead lookout on what we doing then he come and scold us for testing the wheelchair. In the first place we been searching for sales staff but no one and he should courtesy told us and anyway we are genuinely buyer when I told him u help this to cashier I wanted to buy he say NO and walk away I told him I will complaint to yr Manager but he don't care so ego I will make sure he go back to his country to serve their people not right in Singapore no manners so ego not deserve in Singapore
,,3* Shopping But Value for money,3.0,,"Dont expect a flashy shopping experience but I never missed this place on my every visit to Singapore. Be prepared with huge crowd especially later in the day and weekend, the crowd are mainly foreigners and tourists. Narrow lanes within the store but you will be surprised with huge selection of merchandise rights from tidbits, clothes, watches, shoes, luggages, electronic gadgets and the list goes on. The convenient of having everything under 1 roof of 4 levels shopping floors including a counter to handle eTRS (electronic Tourist Refund Scheme) which is claimable at Changi Airport.
The store is open 24hours so the best time to visit with peace of mind is as early as possible and it will be much easier to get a cab to your next destination as getting it later in the day may posed a challenge as most cabbies I noticed very reluctant to pick up passengers around this area."
,,Superstore,3.0,,Lots has been written but the crux is that if you don't have a shopping need or anything specific to buy because it is cheaper out here then there is no reason to visit. Technically speaking it shouldn't be in this travel review. Parking is nightmare and the lanes are narrow.
,,Overwhelming selection,3.0,,"We ventured into the Mustafa Center in the hopes of picking up a couple of things, but we were so overwhelmed by the packed shelves and small walkways that we did not stay long."
,,This place has everything,4.0,,"Every time I visit this place, I never walk out empty handed. Whatever you can think off, this place has it. Watches, clothes, material, groceries, shoes, I could go on. The money exchange usually gives good rates and prices are pretty good."
,,A little spice of India,4.0,,"The surroundngs of Mustafa mall are chock-ablock with Indian restuarants of different types and a provide a welcome taste of home to Indians in Singapore. The mall itself is hug, with several sepate buildings and sections, each stocked with plentiful options, be it watches, groceries or gold. The prices are quite reasonable. The only down-side is the crowding in and around the mall. The best aspect is perhaps the 'all-night open' clause!"
,,Enjoy Mustafa!,4.0,,"When in Singapore, you must visit the Mustafa Centre. It is right in the centre of the equally delightful Little India. Busy? Yes. But that is part of the attraction. The staff at Mustafa are at times, a bit jaded. I prefer this attitude to that of having staff badger you into buying something, anything! Prices aren't really all that low. The experience of being there and soaking up the ambience is half of the fun. I'm due back in Singapore in a couple of weeks time and I will visit Mustafa Centre again."
,,Worst customer service and bad behaviors by the staff,1.0,,Its been the worst of the worst customer service and bad behaviors of the staff. All staff sit in Conner of a place and keep talking. Not bother to help customer. Very rude and arrogant behavior by staff
,,Wild Store,5.0,,"Your one regret after going here may come about if you don't live in Singapore and therefore can't buy some of the produce or meat. Check it out if you have time, and definitely go here to buy souvenirs if you're looking for some. It's basically tons of people crowded into 4 (or 5?) stories of basically everything you can think of. If you're looking for a random snack pick something up from here. The small bottles of goat milk from Malaysia are really good."
,,Cheap stuff,4.0,,"I buy many things here to brought back to jkt. Bought chocolates, tarik tea sachets and also cosmetics here.
I found many lipbalm and also body lotion for friends in jkt.
Other advantages is this is 24hours store so u can go here anytime. And easy to reach by public transportation :)"
,,Exhaustive,3.0,,Its huge ..exhaustive but just another big bazaar replica
,,New updates,4.0,,"Hi, I've visited mustafa centre a number of times. It's well stocked with a lot of things. In particular, perfumes are cheap. They are original products. I would know as I have bought them there a number of times. However this place can get very crowded over the weekends. Best time to shop peacefully are on week days, Especially office hours . Another thing please bear in mind that for foreigners seeking to claim back the gst, please make sure that u spend at least sing 100 dollars in a day, can be cumulated in a maximum of 3 receipts only in a day. So pls plan ur shopping. I was not aware of this n missed out on quite a lot. Nowadays, the refund is in the form of cash in the airport, which is much better, no more the hassle of waiting for them to refund into ur credit card."
,,Worst service in Singapore,2.0,,"The only reason this review is getting 2 stars instead of 0 (if it were available) is the incredible inventory of the store. You can get literally anything you want here - I'm referring to the supermarket. HOWEVER - the staff are blatantly rude and unfriendly. The store is so huge, trying to find a specific item is impossible. I asked 4 different people where to find something, and all were rude, unfriendly and didn't even make eye contact when I said ""excuse me"". The store loses business as a result - I left without buying 3-4 items on my list of 12 - simply because nobody was obliged to tell me where to find them. They either pretended not to understand English, didn't understand it, or plain didn't care, as after asking them a question, they would carry on chatting to their friends in their own language, completely ignoring you. It's one of those stores where if there were any competition for the product range they would not have a business. Awful awful experience. But I will go back to get the stuff I need that can't be found elsewhere in Singapore..."
,,An amazingly diverse range of goods.,4.0,,"If you've never been to Mustafa's visit it at least once, it's a 24hr shopping haven offering everything from high end watches to low end souvenirs and everything in between. This place gets busy, real busy! Avoid Sundays at all costs as it's the workers day off in Sinagpore and a lot of those workers are Indian and flock to Mustafa's and the surrounding shopping precincts. Shop here with an idea of prices as not all the prices beat local competition, however a fair range does. Mustafa offers a range of products long gone from the mainstream market like casio calculator watches. Mustafa's also offers an excellent currency exchange."
,,24 hour shopping,4.0,,"This shopping centre is huge and also crowded especially on weekends. One thing to take note is not all items are cheap. You need to do some research before coming here, or else it would be a waste of time. Best time to go there would be lunch and weekdays or after 2am. Other than that, please be careful with your wallet or belongings."
,,Ridiculously comprehensive,5.0,,Not for the faint of heart. Mustafa Centre has at least 4 variants of every product. I saw products from literally every corner of the earth. This monster shopping centre is an attraction in itself.
,,Cheap shoping,2.0,,Mustafa offers a great choice of products but is not good for good quality goods. This is good for cheap shopping and to eat away time.
,,24-Hour Shop and Complete,4.0,,"I love this place! They have everything from clothes, crafts, medicines to foods and the price is cheaper than everywhere else. In fact I think their price is the cheapest in SIngapore. I bought t-shirts and chocolates here after I compare the price on some shops in Chinatown and one chocolate store in Sentosa Island. My friends and I shopped here until 1 am! Such one cool experience shopping till late night.."
,,One of my favorite,5.0,,this is one of my favorite place for shopping..you can find everything here with affordable price..my favorite transformer hasbro toy for my boy..its even cheaper from Jakarta..you can find also all your favorite chocolate here..the travel bag..etc..forget the time here...
,,24hrs shopping,5.0,,"Like: branded stuff costs much lesser.... better yet.... be a wise shopper, compare compare compare!"
,,Mustafa's is what it is,5.0,,"I find the criticism's of Mustafa's being a little closed minded. Mustafa's is a dept store, which means that not all shops inside are owned by the same guy as another shop so you will find discrepancies in the levels of service, methods of payment and prices of identical goods. In addition there are certain NO-GO times, this largely means Saturday and Sunday between 10 and 10, during these hours the place is packed and I seriously suggest you think again. The place is open 24/7 so if you want an un-crowded experience, go at 2am after your night out, its a refreshing experience!

The reason Mustafa's is packed is because the products are OK quality, difficult, if not impossible to find under one roof elsewhere and cheaper than almost anywhere else. If you don't care if you are paying S4.50 for 2L of milk instead of S4.99 then don't bother going to Mustafa's. If you can't work out that the Sony Hand-phone you are buying is $400 and not £300 and you can't work out the value of the saving, then Mustafa's is not for you. If you have children with you, then Mustafa's is not for you. If you want a warranty, then SINGAPORE is not for you (this is not a Mustafa's issue).

We use the store once a month to buy staples for the household, the savings, we estimate cut our household bill for a house of 6 buy about $200 or so and add more variety than you get from elsewhere in Singapore. For electronic goods I also recommend Mustafa's, largely for the choice. But if buying electronic goods, know what you want and know what it costs, salespersons are honest but not necessarily going to show you their best bargain/deal for $300 if they think they can sell you a better version for $1300.

As a resident I would say Mustafa's is not somewhere to visit to browse as if it is an attraction, only somewhere to visit if you live here. Most products can be found at roughly the same price (maybe 0-20% more) without the fuss of having to get to (and from) Mustafa's!"
,,Why waste time,2.0,,"Ok, so you travel thousands of miles to visit Singapore and its bright lights, shopping and cultural centers etc. So why on earth go to this jam packed pickpocket haven that specializes in junk. It isn't India, it isn't 'wonderful'. Its simply a massive tat market.
Singapore is full of beautiful places, go find and avoid Mustafa. If you do visit - Hang on to your valuables and ladies be warned, you are going into an area where a minority of clientel will enjoy squeezing past you."
,,Please don't waste your time here!,1.0,,"Me and my friends had an extremely bad time here in the congested, tacky place which was warm and humid as hell. Agreed that the shopping items are much cheaper than anything in the city, but the task of moving through there is a bit too much. Many people go there for their shopping, I've heard the spices are pretty awesome, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sad to see that the local people aren't paying much attention to the cleanliness. A bad patch on an otherwise flawless place."
,,Shoppers Stop here,4.0,,"I was amazed with the sheer size of this mega mega supermart as well as the variety offered

Availability of chocolates & various other assortments from different parts of the globe along with its 24 X 7 operations make this to be a mandatory stop over point for everyone who visits singapore"
,,Everything you need is here,3.0,,"Read beforehand that everything that you could possibly need is here. True enough, the mall has everything. It is also open 24 hours. Our hotel is a 15 minute walk to Mustafa's and we only stopped by one late evening when we were running low in SGD. Mustafa's offers the best exchange rates, if I'm not mistaken. It was a good thing that our kids chose to stay at the hotel as Mustafa's is crowded and cramped. It is not an ideal place to go shopping (IMO). More for a place to go to if you need something that you left at home since you can come at any time of the day. We were told that it can get really busy here so go either early in the morning or late at night. We also heard that this is the place to go to for perfumes and chocolates as they come cheap in Mustafa's."
,,Avoid Mustafa like the plague,1.0,,"I had a very unpleasant experience in Mustafa while on a transit - while it has a big selection of products - it also attracts a lot of unpleasant characters who prey on unsuspecting customers like me - the cell phone dept has very narrow aisles and hardly anyplace to stand - its a haven for pickpockets - and i lost a good deal of money, luckily my passport and credit cards were in a more secure place .
I would not have expected this in Singapore and more so in Mustafa which has a a posse of security and plain clothes detectives - i am sure they must know abt these pickpockets - but possibly they are not concerned - be warned and stay away from Mustafa and all the overcrowded counters there - not worth the visit esp as Mustafa is not bothered if customer's lose their valuables as long as they don't lose any of their merchandise.

,,Mustafa Centre is one of Singapore's 24-hour shopping malls,4.0,,"Located at a walking distance from the Farrer Park MRT Station on the North East Line. This is the best shopping center in Little India area. This is a 24 hours open mall and crowded with customers. To avoid crowd, I suggest to start your shopping here at late night.
Mustafa Centre is a huge departmental store which caters mainly to the budget market. The department store at Mustafa Centre consists of two shopping centres: one retailing jewellery, household appliances and has a supermarket and the other selling books, CDs and DVDs, watches, electronic goods, footwear and clothing. Mustafa Centre sells more than 150,000 types of merchandise. Anything you want, just name it and you’ll definitely get it somewhere in the store."
,,Department store with convenient hours and good prices,4.0,,"Mustafa has great prices on groceries and household items. I have noticed that the same products will be priced higher in other stores. I usually take the MRT there so unfortunately that limits how much I can buy at a time. I have also bought luggage there, which has been very durable. They also sell some designer watches and sunglasses, which are not cheap but possibly slightly less expensive than at other department stores. I have even found a little room to bargain on these items, which I have not done at other stores. You do have to be willing to deal with the crowds. People are very polite but those aisles can get crammed. Take note of which entrance you come in at, as there are multiple entrances and it is easy to get lost if you have not been there before."
,,Mustafa is much better than other supermarkets in Singapore!,5.0,,"Mustafa supermarket and money exchange are highly recommended. More choice, cheaper prices and nicer things!"
,,Cheaper by 10% on all other shopping centres,4.0,,It is a bit crazy but you can have fun in what is basically an old style department store that just has everything at a a reasonable price. Felt weird when the security gurads zip tied the shopping bags we took in but apparently they need to do it to keep down shop lifting. Well worth the time.
,,24 hour Super Market! You can buy almost Anything here!,4.0,,"This is a mammoth supermarket and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! It is a huge: 5 floors, 2 blocks longs and I believe there is also a floor in the basement. It is located at Farrer Park (right beside Little India). In general, almost everything is available here (don't expect branded clothes though). The prices of items are comparatively cheaper than other stores in Singapore. I bought a video camera from here a couple months back for $2365 whereas the same product was selling for $2599 at other stores around the city (not comparing with Sim Lim Square as most products at Sim Lim Square are perfect duplicates at one forth the price anywhere else). The salesman was very nice and gave us a professional tripod for free. Items in this store are all genuine. On my trips to Singapore, I also purchase colognes and perfumes from here (two third the price of any other seller).This store is extremely crowded on weekends though! It has many indian restaurants beside this market."
,,Mustafa Centre & Kebab & Curries,2.0,,"Visited in April 2012 and the place is full of junk. Most Items are available cheaper in London and will not trust any electronic goods. Went to Roof Top Restaurant Kebab & Curries and in my whole life (I am 57) and never experienced bad food and pathetic service. We were kept waiting for 20 minutes for Menu and another 20 minutes to take the order. We ordered 3 Starters with Nan and 3 main course dishes at same time. After 25 minutes, only 1 starter came first and others came 10 minutes later. Nan came after we finished the starters and we had to send it back. Even after 45 minutes, there was no sign of our Main Course. We left the restaurant and only paid for main course. The Kebabs were like thin sticks and dry and the chicken was not cooked properly. Probably the worst restaurant I ever been to and do not recommend."
,,great shopping,5.0,,It is huge supermarket. Prices are very reasonable. You can buy whatever you want. And also it is open 24 x 7. I feel goods are cheaper than Duty Free. This is the only place I bought stuff in Singapore. I didn’t have time to go anywhere else. You get Currency exchange close by 24 hours.
,,Mustafa's doesn't have it all!,4.0,,"This retailer was also informative and provided us directions to Mustafa’s, the Harrods of Singapore. Many things can be found in Mustafa’s and although Anthony Bourdain bought a snowglobe for his daughter here, my daughter had the craving for the Cheez-its so we began our search for them. We had brought her some from the states, however, Mustafa’s did not carry that brand of chip. Needless to say, I needed to check out the Batik section to see what kind of deal I received at the “Big Man” shop. I found a Singapore Airlines batik that I purchased for $13 Sing which was half price of the one on the street.

Definitely worth the visit!

,,Take note of expiry dates. Like always. I do. At my one stop Mustafa shop.,4.0,,"I just wanted to advise all visitors to the lovely Mustafa centre in singapore, just to check the expiry dates of some products. Some may expire soon or some later. Just check to avoid regret.

Also they have great veggies and meats section. Electronics in terms of TVs I suggest you shop elsewhere and find what you like with better advice and then come to Mustafa to check if their price is cheaper. Or bargain.

I just moved into my home and did all my shopping at Mustafa to settle into my home. Now wen I need some more items all I think is, I'll just go to Mustafa and get it. Also I find stuff from my home country. Wow."
,,"You Name It, They Sell It!",5.0,,"If you go to Singapore, you must visit this super-complete gigantic department store Mustafa Centre, located in the crowded Little India area with 24/7 service hour. It has been one of the Singapore's icon.

If you come here by midnight, you will not experience the crowd.

They sold everything, except goods prohibited by the law...
gold, watches, perfumes, textile, baggage, groceries, office supplies, clothes, video games, sport equipments, shoes,.... you name it!
They also have Foreign Exchange stall in front of the store and it provides good exchange rate."
,,'Kebabs n Curries',4.0,,"At level 7 is the Rooftop Restaurant 'Kebabs n Curries' a recently commenced Halal Indian indoor and outdoor restaurant. OK, it's difficult to find in the astonishing, rabbit warren, 24/7 Mustafa Centre, but its an absolute gem. Do ALL your shopping then take the elevator along with the shopping trolley to level 7 and enjoy the extensive menu options, attentive service, generous portions and inexpensive experience. There's no other like it in Singapore and I think the local Indian population are trying to keep the place to themselves. Just wonderful !!"
,,A non-stop shopping experience,4.0,,"As is customary with every Indian to visit ‘Mustafa’ on their trip to Singapore, we were no exception. But upon reaching the place, we realised why it is a Mecca for shoppers. The stores are open 24x7 and you can shop for anything you can imagine – with great offers on all the products as well. We did most of our shopping from Mustafa. Just the only drawback is that the VAT refund system here is very slow. So be prepared for the delay in getting the money back!"
,,Cramped but appears to provide good deals,4.0,,"Our family visited on a mission to get some specific items not easily available in Thailand for our friend. I was amazed to see this huge department store to be open 24/7! We found what we were looking for, but I must say that this shop was quite hard to navigate with a stroller, since the corridors between the shelves are really narrow. Access is quite easy even from the closest metro (MRT) station which is a few hundred metres away."
,,Shopping !!!,3.0,,"Cheap things, still open at late night, but very crowded"
,,24/7 shopping,3.0,,"See it as a huge supermarket with both food as non-food goods! You find it all... Ok, can not compare with the sort of boutiques at Orchard... Here you can find more the normal 'daily' things.... And I think quiet cheap... Branded goods but not the high end brands... But Apple/IPad, Sony goods and other gadgets to buy as bread...and 100% original, not to forget to mention!!! And again I think way more cheaper even as tax-free on the airport... (tax free refund for foreigners or non SG residents!!!).
Go here very late at night or early in the morning... As it is open around the clock... Otherwise it is way more crowded as Orchard Rd is!
Also branded perfume for sale like the common and commercial brands as Chanel, Dior, Armni, ferragamo, Armani etc. And these are definitely same price as at the duty free shops at SIN or even cheaper!
About shoes: I saw collections of Clarcks, Crocks and more of that kind of brands... Also sport outfits...
And.... A postoffice which is also open 24/7!!!
Around the center... A lot of restaurants and eateries.. Most Indian kitchen as it is located in Little India... But also. Few Chinese stalls and even a Mc.D!"
,,Just ok,3.0,,I dont really like the place - maybe because I'm abit tired at that time as is it the last place to visit for the day. A bit messy. But you can get everything that you want here - much choice with cheaper price.
,,Almost everything in one place,3.0,,"Super convenient place to shop i would say. You get just about anything from electronics,cosmetics,clothing, food, accessories, perfumes most things you would imagine. One entire floor full of shoes!! Prices are very reasonable or cheap i would say.."
,,Good shopping at good prices and variety,4.0,,In little india so mostly south Asians and local Chinese shoppers. Give it a try and if you don't like it you can spend rest of evening in well priced nearby resturants. Lots of content so small spaces which is common in the bazaar type malls. You can get just about everything you need.
,,"Huge mall, no cheaper than home",2.0,,Huge and hard to navigate with almost too much choice in items to buy. Items that we were interested in (electronic etc) were cheaper at home in NZ! Maybe worth a visit (if only for food) but probably not the best place to buy things in Singapore
,,Enormous shopping mall with everything you could want - several times over,4.0,,"Mustafa is a gargantuan shopping mall that has survived in Singapore for many years. It's gradually expanded by purchasing adjacent buildings and redeveloping them, like a commercial version of Star Trek's Borg, but with reasonably priced toaster ovens.

Perhaps because of the slightly haphazard nature of its growth, Mustafa is rather chaotic; you'll walk past a row of musical keyboards, then some toaster ovens, then some gold jewellery, a rack of football shirts ... and then some more toaster ovens.

I'm partly convinced that Mustafa isn't a shop, so much as a grand metaphor for reincarnation and the circularity of life, such that whatever choices you make, you always end up seeing toaster ovens. But that overlooks the sheer range of stuff in Mustafa: from cheap watches to enormous freezers, from video games for couch potatoes to weightlifting equipment for gym rats, from shampoo and perfume to ... AA batteries. Oh, and toaster ovens. Did I mention those yet?

Thus, in the chaos of Mustafa we can see both a rebuke of the general orderliness of Singaporean society, and also a great convenience. No matter what you want, it's probably on sale in Mustafa, and because the place is so insanely arranged, it doesn't matter what direction you take, as you're bound to encounter it if you walk in a straight line for more than ten yards.

Not as hyper-antiseptic as the more modern malls, but much more fun. And open pretty much all the time (although much more crowded at the weekends)"
,,Total Shopping in one Place,5.0,,Not always the best price but certainly the greatest selection of every product you would ever need. A supermarket too with everything from electronics to Gold
,,Thanks Singapore and Obviously Mustafa,5.0,,"I didn't knew about this system in Singapore. Nobody discussed it, but it is a very useful Information for all. I am talking about GST( Goods and Services Tax). When you in Singapore you have to pay GST for each and everything you buy, even for a water bottle.
But what Singapore Govt. do for the tourists is, they give back the Tax amount which we pay as we are not Permanent Residents or Citizens, we are just tourists there for a small period.
If you buy anything amounting more than 100SGD making in a single bill or max 3 bills from same outlet, the Tax amount paid, will be refunded.
I had bought Gold and done other shopping from Mustafa Centre, worth more than 4000 SGD, and paid GST around 250 SGD. The procedure is very simple, went to their GST refund office in the store with the original bills, they gave me a form to be stamped in Airport. I came to the airport, produced them the items, they weighed the gold. The form was stamped by them, I posted it back to Mustafa in a pre-paid stamped cover addressed to Mustafa Centre. And after 6 weeks, they have sent me Demand Draft to my home address in India after deducting their service charges.
The whole process is so simple and hassle free, even I didnt knew about this before, but Super Good Singapore people and Customs officials make it happen.
Thanks Mustafa Centre and Singapore Govt."
,,Very very bad experience,1.0,,"The salesman are stupid and uneducated, don't know how to talk to customers.. If you are buying things it looks as if they are doing favour..horrible salesman..worst shopping experience of my life!!"
,,A to Z what one can think of is available here,5.0,,"What one can find in a super megastore right from hardware, clothing, trekking equipment, shoes, accessories, electronics, lighting, blah blah blah..

It is a heaven under one roof. To do justice to dis store one has to spend few days itself! Extremely big and slightly cramped. Be prepared to get lost!"
,,Shop during midnight,3.0,,"I always visit Mustafa centre whenever I stopover in Singapore. The best time is during midnight, after visiting all other tourist object, including orchard road. The area is never sleeps, during weekends it is full with many people, mostly come from East Asia. I found from years the price is uprising, not cheap anymore. Though, it is always fun to look for chocolate, fruits and drinks from the supermarket, and hardware equipment. The Indian food is open till morning in this area, and Mustafa has open new kebab food stall in the new building."
,,Must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"If you want top shop in Singapore, you must go to the Mustafa Centre. They have everything you could ever want to buy... tourist items, groceries, office supplies, clothes, eyegalsses.... everything! The Centre is made up of several levels and fi they don;t have it, it doesn't exist!"
,,"Reasonable price,less touristry",4.0,,"I enjoyed Shopping at mustafa because i was amazed with many kind of choices.I went there to buy a travel cooker.
There like about 7 levels building.selling from raw cashew nuts to cloth iron.not a touristry area, so the price was reasonable.
I would definitely shop at mustafa again if I visit Singapore"
,,Under one roof for those essentials but not the cheapest,4.0,,"I always recommend Mustafa's for my expatriate friends from Bali or the new arrivals to Singapore as they can pick up anything they need at one place . The prices are not the highest but not the lowest either . The IPad 2 sold at 10 dollars higher than a premium Apple reseller in Orchard Road but still , it means getting anything from Manuka honey to swimming caps to ginger beer at one place .
Avoid going after 5 pm in the evenings unless post midnight since it is 24 hours and definitely not on weekends"
,,Not sure what the attraction is,3.0,,Felt like i was visiting a dollar store full of souvenir items. Worth walking through just so you can feel like the entire population of Singapore is with you. Small aisles filled with tons of stuff. I think maybe some of the food items might be good but I didn't buy anything. I was too overwhelmed by the souvenir items.
,,good and best shopping place,5.0,,good and best shopping place for all types of things from needs to heaviest items to east or to live with or to use it anything you want get it here
,,What don't they have?,5.0,,"This store is chock-full of everything you can imagine...and lots of it! They have electronics, cosmetics, food, souvenirs, clothes, shoes... The list goes on and on. The handbag section alone could take an hour to walk through! And it's open 24 hours a day! Yes, Orchard Road has all of the fancy stores, but Mustafa Center is really fun to walk through."
,,Cramped walkways,2.0,,Too many goods dumped on every inch of space. Could hardly find space to walk. Aisle can accomodate only single person. Goods n merchandise are haphazardly placed n we feel trapped inside. Would not be back a second time.
,,Terrible. Stay away,1.0,,"This is a terrible place to visit. It's cramped and quite claustrophobic. Don't ever go there with your little children as its impossible to maneuver a kids pram in the crowd both inside and outside the mall. I had read on the net about its value for money deals, but that maybe true for residents who go there for their grocery shopping. Its definitely not a spot for tourists to visit."
,,Good place to shop,4.0,,"Mustafa center is truely a good place to shop. You will buy thing here relatively cheaper than the Malls in Orchrd street. It is a good place to buy Polo T shirts, chocolates, mixed fruits, razor blades, colognes. However if you are looking for brand items like Rayban sunglasses , Guccis , Armanis you will have to go Takshima or Center Point mall in Orchard street. It is a very crowded mall. You can also take the MRT from ferrer Park station . It is walking distance from the Mall.If you want to go tio Orchard street take the underground train to Dobyghaut and then change train to Orchard station. In Mustafe you will find plenty of stuff to shop. i would suggest you take time to visit the place and enjoy Singapore........"
,,get everyting under 1 roof- 24 x 7,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is located in Little India and is a favorite for shopaholics being that it is open 24hrs. 4 floors, over 70,000 sq. ft. of retail space and more then 150,000 products, i guess you could call it a shoppers paradise.

If looking for the best prices in Singapore, then Mustafa Centre is not the first place to hit. Prices are not high, but there is no bargaining at Mustafa.

It sells groceries, clothes, electronics, jewelry, perfume and all other kinds of kitsch. Name it, they probably have it. They have got a money changer, a post office and a cafe.
if you are looking for everything under one roof, then i would recommend Mustafa as your first stop."
,,The one place I could afford to shop in Singapore,4.0,,"Coming from neighbouring Malaysia, Singapore proved to be a VERY expensive place for me because of the currency exchange. So, I hardly did any shopping.

Mustafa's is where I really blew my money as the prices were affordable for me. The place is not for everyone. If you're expecting a glitzy mall, this is not the place. It's no frills. Don't expect attentive service from staff on a mission to earn a commission. Manage your expectations and you'll enjoy the place.

I went there around 7am, so I pretty much had the whole place to myself. It's open 24 hours, so if you hate crowds, go early in the morning.

Other reviews mentioned things are not cheap at Mustafa's. I'm not certain as the rest of Singapore was expensive for me, so I just gave up the idea of buying anything from the local malls. Hence, no price comparison.

But I did find batteries incredibly cheap compared to Malaysia, specifically Sanyo CR2 batteries ($4.50) and Eneloop rechargeable batteries. Yes, even with the exchange rate. I couldn't believe the prices we pay for those in Malaysia. I stocked up on a lot of those to last me the next few years.

Local perfumes cost around $6 and are fun buys if you want to smell like jasmine or any of the other local flowers. I also got the big bottle of the first Salvatore Ferragamo EDP at only $65. It was probably a promo price.

Prices are fixed, just like almost all other places in Singapore. I don't know why some reviewers made a fuss about this. This is not a street market. It'll save you the trouble of haggling. Of course the staff won't give you a discount. It's the same if you go to Carrefour or Tesco. Asia is not one big sweatshop. So don't expect to drive prices so low traders can't make a decent profit. Traders need to pay decent prices to suppliers and manufacturers too.

My one complaint is the confusing layout. There is a fabric department? I missed that. If you see something, get it. Don't hope to come back later as you may not find the department again. The shopping centre is in two buildings connected with a bridge. The place is so huge you won't remember which side you're on. I memorised the entry door number so I could exit at the same place and find my way back easily to the MRT station."
,,GREAT PLACE FOR SHOPPING,5.0,,"Before my Singapore trip, my friends who have been to Singapore, told me to visit Mustafa.Coincidentally,the hotel where I put up during my recent trip to Singapore was very close to Mustafa Centre.So, I visited Mustafa almost everyday during my 4-day stay in Singapore.It is an amazing shopping mall with vast multitude of collections of items.The best part is that there are quite a number of Indian Food Restaurants in and around Mustafa.It is a great place to spend quality time.

I recommend Mustafa to all visitors to Singapore."
,,Lots of stuff to look at and good prices,3.0,,The surrounding area is quite different to other parts of Singapore.

,,Only for buy some stuff..,4.0,,"Mustafa Centre is a place to buy some stuff from cosmetics, perfumes, dress, and all home needs. It is not a place for tourist to hang out, don't go here if you don't want to buy something. But if you want to shop, I definitely recommend this place. What I love the most is its open 24hours, so if you don't know where to go at night in Singapore, you can go here and shop all night long!"
,,"Patchwork & Fabric - Mustafa Centre, Singapore",4.0,,"We were told by locals this is the place to shop. Mustafa Centre is located in the Little India section of Singapore at 145 Syed Alwi Road, Singpore. Take the MRT (Mass Rapid Train) which is fast and cheap to Farrer Park station and follow the signs to the Mustafa Centre. I found the fabric (textile) dept by accident on Basement level or B1. It is a big building that sells everything and anything and lots of it. There were heaps of silks, indian sari material, sarongs from Indonesia and a lot I didn't recognise. There were laces and so much to choose from. The men measure and cut and then you take your goodies to the cashiers. I also like to buy buttons and other embellishments but found NONE.

If you want to buy pre made ladies outfits or traditional clothes ie. sari's or chinese outfits then the ladies dept has a huge selection.

If your purchases total over $100 (we also bought a camera) then you can claim back the 7% GST that they charge. You need to go to the GST counter and fill in the paperwork to request a refund - it is tricky to find but ask.

If you are travelling on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia then check out Kamdar - it is the BEST place ever for fabric but I will be posting a review so check back later and I'll post it.

Happy shopping."
,,Waste of time.,1.0,,"The Mustafa Centre is totally misrepresented by most tourist websites. It's a huge complex of fake goods at high prices for what they are. Furthermore all prices are fixed. ""Nike"" marked joggers which seems to have re-thread tyres for soles. It's a joke."
,,Mustafa Centre - not worth the hassle,2.0,,"Mustafa Centre is frequently recommended in internet posts and travelers guides as the place to go for good prices on electronics. But the couple of times I've visited there, I haven't been impressed at all. First, it's too crowded in many areas of the stores, so you have to wait to get a clerk's attention if you want to examine an item that's in a display case or behind the case. You even have to wait to have your bag sealed by security to enter the stores. Second, many items that are sold as new seem to have been used or at least extensively handled before.

Third, prices aren't that much lower than at other shops, if you are talking about, say, mobile phones accessories, which was one of the things I was looking for recently. Another example: I was looking to replace a watch when the battery died the other day. I prefer this cheap kind of watch for traveling because I don't have to worry about damaging it or losing it or of having it stolen. The main downside is that once the battery dies (which usually takes a couple of years), you need to replace the watch.

I've bought this same brand/style of watch several times over the years in the US for about US$10. I found Mustafa Centre selling the watches for Sg$19. I offered to pay Sg$12, but the clerk wouldn't take anything less than Sg$19. And this is with the watches actively running, meaning that the battery is being used -- who knows how much life is left in the watches, and with the watches being sold without their original cases (who's to say if they are new or used)?
A quick check on amazon.com, and I see that the same watches are selling for US$7 (about Sg$9) right now.

Yes, there are some advantages to shopping at Mustafa Centre, if you are specifically looking for certain kinds of groceries popular in the Middle East or Near East. But for electronics, there are much better choices.

If I'm going to pay a few dollars more anyway, I'd rather it be in one of the more spacious, clean, shiny shops with plenty of new items in the original packaging, sold by smiling clerks!"
,,"Not for everyone, but good place to buy sarongs",3.0,,"I wanted to buy a number of sarongs for gifts, and this is the place for the largest selection. They have literally thousands on display in the basement, ranging from S$7.50 to S$28.00. We found a very helpful saleslady who explained the different qualities of fabric (hence the price differences). On the second floor, I found some very nice, long scarves for S$5.00 (they were in the household goods section, of all places). The mega-store is geared towards locals, but if you have patience, tolerance for crowds and can fend on your own with minimal assistance, you can find some good deals. Prices are set, so no haggling."
,,Dont even go there,5.0,,"We went to the Mustafa Centre after some people said it was good we they forget it the Staff are not helpfull at all and the Bargains are not that hot.We also had Lunch in the same Building very dear and not very good.Go to Chinatown you get a lot of Bargins and the People are frienly,otherwise we loved Singapore and all the Tours we took the Zoo with Breakfast,Night Out.Jurong Bird Park,The Flyer.The Orchid Garden.Singapore River Experience.City Experience"
,,Its for the locals,3.0,,"First of all, its not a tourist spot. Its a shopping center, mainly for the locals. If you are in Little India, visit the place to get good exchange rates and buying souvenirs."
,,"Culture, Choice and Celebration",4.0,,Everytime I go to Singapore I make sure I go to Mustafas. It is a huge department store which sells everything under the sun. The range in products is huge and at very affordable prices. It is THE place to go if you want to see the Asian culture interwoven with a department store and I would definitely recommend going to. All taxi drivers know how to take you there and they cost nothing!
,,"Entertainment, shopping and exotic culture all rolled into one.",5.0,,"It took 2 visits exploring the Mustafa Centre with my teenage son ( who usually hates shopping) to see most of its 150,000 types of merchandise. We spent hours looking at the amazing and exotic array of clothing , shoes and jewellery and gadgets and came away with bags full of bargained priced items.
Our second visit was late at night as Mustafa's stays open till 12 in its newer dept store, the older part stays open 24hrs. We were amazed at 1am, Indian families still out shopping on a week night, watching the other shoppers was as entertaining as any tourist attraction can be and its free. I defy anyone to visit Mustafa's and not come away impressed, it is entertainment and shopping all rolled into one. Fabulous!"
,,Poor Service and a creditabilty issue!,1.0,,"Mustafa is a great place to visit for anything and everything but buyer beware!

I had a 6hr transit in Singapore in the early hours, so I went shopping at Mustafa.

I wished to purchase a Bluetooth headset. Firstly it took a while to get the salespersons attention! I was given a slip which you take to cashier to pay. Upon returning home to Australia I found that an item was missing.

I had a Singaporean friend return to store today with a copy of the receipt to be told by the sales assistant that the missing item was never included and the receipt stated the wrong information.

My advice is not to shop there at all! Or at least check the goods & receipt after paying for the item before leaving the store."
,,Money changer - Mustafa foreign exchange Pte Ltd cheat,2.0,,They cheat by giving no longer circulated $100000 Indonesian Rupiah. How would we know this is a no longer circulated notes!!!!! They deny everything!!!! Shld had ask them to check their CCTV!!!!!
,,Where else in Singapore do you get so many items under one roof?,2.0,,"However, it is not the best place for a quick shopping. Most items are a little bit cheaper. Many are on the verge of expiry and items without international warranty are surely bad. The attitude of almost all salesperson at Mustafa is totally unfriendly. I am yet to see one friendly salesperson there. They are busy chatting away or staring at people. The look they give if you ask for help is something you would remember for a long time. It is high time their staff be given some special training on how to serve customers. If Mustafa is still doing business, it is just because of the variety of items they sell and the tax they pay to govt. Their main tactic is to not organize the store. You can get an individual item in different parts of the same 'old mustafa'. So there is no way you will miss a thing. You will see it in one place or the other. But no one can ever guide you to the item, if you are in a hurry. The Mustafa facing Srenagoon Road (renovated mustafa) is a bit more spacious and organized; but surprisingly less crowded. :)"
,,Heavy crowd and not expected good service,2.0,,"Mustafa centre is heavy crowd always and tourist must know the fire exit before enter into the shop. There is no proper sign for fire exit and product sections. Some of the products are cheap and some won’t. You have to do some research if you buy costly items such as gold, electronics etc...
Last year I went with my family and they were not allowed the pram to enter into the mall and we dropped the shopping plan. This year I went again couple of times without my family to Mustafa for purchasing. Tamil is one of the national languages of Singapore and most of the staffs speak in Tamil and it was easy for me to communicate through Tamil with them. But staffs still wouldn’t respond properly except diamond and some jewellery section.
I asked about one product then they asked me to go to an another building, after I reached another building then those guys asked me to go back to the previous building. I got too much frustrated and dropped to buy that product. I asked a staff that “where the ear rings available?”... She responded “You don’t know where the ear rings are?” I said “No”... It is in Jewellery section (Wow what an answer)... I asked again “Where is the Jewellery section?” 
You can buy cheap products in Little India but not in Mustafa. After your purchase you have to wait for a long queue to get your GST refund. 1 or 2 staffs only assist the customers.
I have checked the currency exchange rate all over Singapore, Mustafa is giving good exchange rate. It is good for Jewellery also. After finish your purchase it is nightmare to catch a taxi. You have to go to the middle of the road and get a taxi.

Pros: Open 24 hours, buy all products in one roof, best currency exchange rate

Cons: Heavy crowd (Morning less crowd), staffs not responded properly, no proper signs including fire exit, not giving proper respect to the customers, getting taxi is also difficult."
,,mustafa - a place not to shop,1.0,,"salesmen dont know english ... even they cant speak simple english ... u ask for the price and thay tell u size ( i asked for underwear not labelled vth price tag )

salesmen dont have product knowledge ... when i asked ... what kind of material use to make this particular bottle ... is it plastic or something else ... sales girl simply said ...dont know and dont bother to ask supirior"
,,Be careful when you buy expensive things,2.0,,"As usual with indians, I was put up in Little india, and was directed to mustafa for shopping by the tour guides.

the place is bit crowded, and cramped. on the first day, i bought a JVC handicam. the salesperson, was at first bit unresponsive, later relented to show some features. but I would say, i was far from satisfied. I also looked at some SLR cameras.

when i been to orchard road, i went to a small camera shop, where I found a nice canon which was about 20% under priced than in mustafa. the guy was quite friendly, took great care in responding to me, and i made the deal.

later i checked the price of my handicam, and found that i had overpayed for it. at changi airport duty free, there were more selections of JVC handicams, newer models, and 25% cheaper!

so, go to mustafa, only to buy cheap perfumes or soaps."
,,24 hrs shopping,3.0,,"The best part about Mustafa is that it is open 24 hrs. You can plan to sacrifice one night there.
The pace is huge with lots of variety. An over sized hypermart. Before I went there I was under impression that things would be pretty cheap their. Not really.
I must admit I got a good deal on a few electronics items but thats not true for all the products sold their. Its not good for someone who is exploring mode and not aware of the normal prices. Make sure you decide beforehand, search on the net and then go shopping there. A few, maybe 5 - 10% of the products have an excellent deal. The remaining 90% of the products are at the same prices as other outlets."
,,Cheating at Mustafa Center....Like daylight robbery,1.0,,"It was my first trip for me and my family to Singapore in August last year and someone recommended Mustafa center to buy good and reliable electronic goods. My wife selected a Canon movie camera with a price tag of 754 Sing Dollars and there was no bargain or discount. We agreed for the price as the display says ""If you find cheaper anywhere...."" meaning that is fair price or atleast equivalent to any other place in Singapore. She picked anther still photography camera ""Nikon"" and we were happy that we got some goo things at fair prices........until we moved on to other places around in Singapore and then realized that we were cheated. For both the cameras, we paid 1140 Sing Dollars compared to so many other RELIABLE shops just for below 900 Sing Dollars. We almost dropped tears realizing such a popular market robs in broad daylight by fooling people that they are the cheapest.

A few days later, we approached the shop at Mustafa and presented our case with evidence. All they tried to convince us that every other place sells duplicate so is the price difference.

Shame on Mustafa to cheat people, you are doing a broad dayklight robbery on unarmed people. My advice is to be careful, they fool."
,,Do your homework before you make that purchase by Bargain Hunter,3.0,,"If you are going to Mustafa Centre looking to stretch your dollar, make sure you do your homework first. I agree that many of their goods are reasonably priced, compare to stores on the main Orchard Road shopping belt. However, it seems to be Mustafa's strategy to lull shoppers into believing that everything is cheaper across the board, when this is hardly the case. Some products can be up to 20% dearer than at the established upmarket malls in the city, so do your homework before making any purchase. The Umbro jerseys mentioned by some reviewers here are old stock & the designs are sometimes from 4-5 seasons ago. I bought one such jersey, only to discover that there was a tear in the armpit area, which I didn't notice at the store. The current jerseys worn by the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Real Madrid, England etc. don't differ in price from more upmarket stores in town. The sales staff are unfriendly & lack adequate product knowledge. They seem more interested in protecting their goods from pilferage than actually serving customers. Anyone entering the store is viewed as a potential shoplifter & eyeballed whenever they touch anything. The cable ties on shopping bags & on purchases are a chore to remove when getting back to the hotel."
,,"not for everyone, but fine with me",4.0,,"During my two last visit in Singapore, on November 2006 dan March 2007, i came to Mustafa Center. On my first visit a tour guide who's an Indonesian with a working basis in Batam (which means he tavelled to Singapore almost every month) reccomend me to try Mustafa as a place to shop.

And i quite like it. Off course it is not the place for everyone. It means travellers who seeks comfort is not advised to come. Yes, on saturday and friday's nite the place is jammed with shoppers. And to find the best item that you want you have to sort through everything by yourselves. My tour guide also warned me to watch my belongings carefully especially when the place is packed with people.

But, the best thing is as a middle budget traveller i find shopping in Mustafa suits my wallet. Almost everything on sale there came on cheaper price than sold on stands at any regular shopping center especially compared with at orchard road. I got an Umbro soccer shirt with good quality for only 10 SGD!

And the singapore souvenirs are also much cheaper there. So is for the chocolates.

Probably any price came with a consequences. I didnt find anything too trendy there also. But, overall its a good place to shop. Especially if you are in a tight budget and time."
,,Do not shop at Mustafa Shopping Centre,1.0,,"Me and my husband visited Singapore in March 08. I had earlier visited Singapore some 4-5 years back and I knew that Singapore is a shopping heaven. So I had Mustafa on my list.

We decided to buy Mobiles for us and we zeroed in on Mustafa after reading soooo many good reviews about it.We decided on the models and headed to Mustafa. I was actually surprised on how bad the place has turned out to be..lots of people were in the shop..the salesperson was unaware about the mobile features.We asked whether they will give us International Guarantee of these mobiles for which they refused. The place looked shady..But with good reviews on various forums we shirked all our doubts and went ahead and shopped the mobiles. All good..we returned home and started using the mobiles. My mobile worked fine for few days after which it hangs while I am talking..sometimes it refuses to ring even when I get calls..sometimes it refuses to make me ring a missed call..sometimes it simply blanks out!! The memory chip place holder is loose and so is the SIM holder place...My husbands mobile has similar problems.

So I would suggest that if someone is planning to shop in Mustafa its better you have good know how of the thing you are buying so that you dont feel cheated and if you dont have the know how then the best thing you can do is not to buy at all from there!"
,,Bad Experience at Mustafa Money Changer,1.0,,"I had a bad experience at the Money Changer in Mustafa Centre. I was in the queue for about 15 minutes, and when it was my turn, they simply closed the counter and refused to serve me and the rest of the people in the queue. They did not even bother to explain or apologize. I just don't understand why did'nt they inform the people in the queue in advance that they were about to close.
Such is the kind of nonsense you can expect from Mustafa !"
,,Bad Shopping Experience,1.0,,"Its a place where you can buy a range of goods at a competitive price. But its very crowded, one could hardly move about with their shopping. The system adopted for payment is highly inconvenient, having to go back and forth to cashiers and sales personnel. Most of the personnel are very rude and poorly trained which is the most degrading aspect to this place. It is worth shopping somewhere else and paying a bit more just for a better shopping experience."
,,Cheap Branded electronic gadgets,4.0,,"One thing I like are the cheap prices of electronic gadgets;e.g. portable DVD players; celphones, etc., as compared to Funan Shopping mall or Chinatown! Prices are what is indicated in the tags so your don't have to haggle."
,,Not a bargain place for us,3.0,,"Knowing we only buy something to use at home and clothes to wear at home, we were at Mustafa on a Saturday in April 2007. We came around 8:30am so we had space to walk.

From about 11am, the place was packed with people. The floor where foods, drinks, rice, fruits, candies, chocolates, canned products... were sold was extremely crowded by Indian people and others who look like Indian. Every Cashier Counter has at least 10 people waiting with full shopping trolley, so we went to another floor to pay.

Quantity: yes, a lot to look.

Quality: not so high. Many clothes were from Thailand (Pratunam or Bobey in Bangkok for example) so the prices here were higher.

A cashier was not happy when we bought something S$4 and gave her S$50. She talked about that with her colleague in her language. Being a tourist, after we changed US$ to S$, we often have S$50 notes. If I had known this, I would have paid in the end with everything I bought instead of one by one.

The whole place was air-conditioned so it was a plus. The guard let us brought in our bags but sealed them with plastic wraps and we had a bad time cutting them at home after shopping (bring your little scissors when traveling).

Talking about clothes and things to use at home, 3 of us found that Mustafa was not a place for us:

- If you say it is a big place to shop, sorry we don’t think it’s big.
- Nothing was called brand here if we want some good clothes or good underwear.
- Too crowded.
- Prices were not cheaper than in Chinatown Singapore, Bugis Night Market or another dress / clothes shop we found around Selegie area.
- Compared with Mustafa, Tekka Mall gave you space to walk and had lower prices, although not many things were sold in Tekka.
- In my opinion, Tanglin Mall near Traders Hotel is a better place to buy foods, fruits and drinks: less crowded, fresh products and nicer place.
- I think there was no food court in Mustafa so we had to look for somewhere to eat after shopping."
,,Seems to have it all,4.0,,"If you had a lost as to what to buy regarding souvenirs, electric goods, jewellery, clothes are just want to do some general shopping then head to Little India to Mustafa centre.

Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week it seems to have it all.

My tip look for some nuggets at the children's toy department. We bought a big pink Winnie the Pooh (traditional design) for a few pounds."
,,Shopping with the Locals,5.0,,"Whatever you do when in Singapore, do not miss the Mustafa Centre, but don't bother going in the main entrance in Serangoon Road where all the taxi drivers take you. This part of the department store is geared towards tourists who do not want to experience a taste of India. Go down the side street towards the back of the building. There you will find entrances to where all the Indians and locals go to shop.

Here, particularly on a week-end night you will have to jostle with all the locals who do their shopping here. The aisles are small and crowded, the cashiers flat out but it is an exciting place. If you have too many purchases you can take them outside and put them in ""holding"" while you go and buy more. The shop even goes across a laneway to another part of this vast complex.
Mustafa is the place to buy anything you could imagine. Apart from the usual watches, jewellery and electronics, you can buy virtually anything else. The ground floor has a great section of beauty products at a fraction of the cost that you would buy at home. Vitamins, a chemist, DVD's, CD's, perfume, costume jewellery, you name it, you can buy it.

Downstairs is the clothing/material section. There are sarees on sale for S$20. This is 6m of material that can be used as exquisite curtains. They sell rugs from Turkey, underwear, womens clothing mens clothing and childrens clothing.

Unfortunately I ran out of time, but Mustafa also sells homewares and groceries and I don't know what else I missed out on."
,,24 hour shopping paradise,5.0,,"Mustafa center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week... great selection, on like 8 floors, you can buy almost ANYTHING here... Highly recommended, near Ferrar MTR metro station."
,,The best all over Singapore!,5.0,,"I am a visitor in Singapore. I am living here for about a month. I live in some friend's house so I cook by myself sometimes. When I visited the super markets in orchard road to buy some vegetable and saw those prices i got mad! A small box of 10-12 strawberries for about 10$ SIN (almost 5 euro!). I realised that it is chaper to eat in a restaurant that cook by yourslef at home!

Fortunately some people told me about Mustafa center in Farrer Park. I visited this hyper-market several times! The MRT station is almost outside! And the prices there, are very low compared to the other malls! I bought some vegetable, fruits, rice (fantastic variety!!) and anything else you can imagine! This store sells everything, from a toothpick to an elephant!! The prices are so reasonable! Even at the perfumes department. The prices were better than the duty-free in the airport!

generally I suggest this store to all those people who dont want to spend their money and buy nothing! Also have a look at the bed-sheets department! Big variety! I bought a batik hand made tablecloth for 10 euro!

Also very polite employees! They do anything to serve you better!"
,,Avoid It,1.0,,"This place used to be a wonderful place to shop. Every time I am in Singapore I go there. I live in Bangkok, but have been visiting Singapore much less.

I attempted to find out from the staff about the availability of some items before I booked a new flight.
