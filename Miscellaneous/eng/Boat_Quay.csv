,,Really Cool Area,4.0,,Had lunch in the area and walked around afterwards. Super cool architecture and a very fun walk along the river. Definitely worth a visit while in town.
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"Worth a visit. Plenty to see heaps of bars and restraunts. Wear comfy shoes, very crowded at lunchtime. Nice views of Singapore river and CBD. Can take a bum boat ride from here."
,,Buyer beware,3.0,,"What was once a busy commercial wharf is now a popular dining and entertainment venue along the Singapore River.

Many restaurants display some very unusual seafood in tanks along the sidewalk.

We enjoyed our lunch there, but left one restaurant when we realized it was a bait and switch situation."
,,River of life,5.0,,"The Boat Quay comes to life in the evening! The place gets crowded with tourist after dark and the drinking holes that line the Singapore river can get rather crowded. Enjoyed the crowd and the liveliness. But it can get a tat too humid and warm, given the islands tropical climate. A good time to visit is after 9pm when the weather cools down a little more."
,,Great Location,5.0,,We loved our time in Singapore and the boat quay was a relaxing area for us to visit. Its not often in cities like Singapore where you can find a peaceful spot. Singapore is our favourite!
,,Work or leisure - Boat Quay fits it all,5.0,,"Riverside Bars n Restaurants, Different cuisines, Good for Singles or Family, Great Atmosphere, Lovely Food... Need you ask for more."
,,Be careful of the cost,1.0,,My Girlfriend and I shared 1 lobster and 6 oysters and they charged me over $850 SGD !!! That is OVER $600 USD I am still shell shocked (excuse the pun) do not eat at any of these restaurants !!!
,,Sit here and soak up local Singapore,4.0,,"One of our favorite places when we visit Singapore. There are lots of bars and restaurants to choose from here, although our favorite is Charlies. Check out Happy Hour drinks and relax watching river boats full of tourists drift by, as well as guys on little boats fishing leaves out of the river which is actually a reservoir. Enjoy the contrast of the finest architecture and feel part of the local scene as office workers call here for drinks after work."
,,Great Happy Hour at Boat Quay,4.0,,"A perfect place for a nice evening, beautiful people around in company of good drinks and some good restaurants."
,,Not my cup of tea,3.0,,Walked down this a couple of times and I hate restaurants who flash menus and offer happy hour drinks to get you in. Didnt seem overly busy when we were there. Not somewhere i would make a point of going for dinner
,,Fun,5.0,,Boat Quay is located between North Bridge Road and Anderson Bridge. You can have leisurely stroll along the river or admire the view which include Marina Bay Sands and Singapore’s central business with high-rise buildings. You can find numerous bars and clubs in this area. It is 12 min walk from Clarke Quay
,,Once The Major Port Area Back In the 19th Century,4.0,,Back in the 1860's this was the major port area of Singapore but over the years has been developed into a very pleasant walking mall that goes from the old Shophouses near UOB to the Elgin Bridge. Good views and an open area with views .Boat Quay used to be a road by this name and is now a pedestrian mall
,,The Singapore way of doing things,4.0,,"The Singapore way of doing things has also filtered into Boat Quay. It was always nice to visit, a pleasant walk and a magic spot in the evening, when the sun had set and you could have a fairy tale meal at the river side with the illuminated Sampam boats went by and the tall buildings of the business district looked down on the riverside restaurant areas. This is still the same, but in the couple of years I haven't visited Singapore, some things have changed a bit. Some years ago every restaurant had ""barkers"" who forced menus on the tourists walking by, promising discounts. It seems that this practice has abandoned and now restaurants await customers in an orderly way with fixed menu prices. Also the practice of charging for peanuts and napkins was abandoned in the restaurants I visited. Boat Quay has become a bit duller in this regulated aspect, doing things the Singapore way, but Boat Quay is still a prime attraction in Singapore."
,,The viewpoint,5.0,,This is a favorite for us. Beautiful place to stroll and take in the area.Lots of restaurants...not cheap but worth it.
,,Boat Quay so good.,5.0,,We love Singapore and we love the different foods. Boat Quay is a great place to go and see the river views at night and experience some great foods.
,,Best spot,5.0,,"Good food, Friendly staffs, nice river view and good ambiance. I was enjoying my time here and will come back once were back in SG"
,,Boat Quay @ Singapore,5.0,,"A popular and historical Quay in Singapore, situated along Singapore river, sandwiched between Clarke Quay and Marina Bay. Numerous restaurants , drink bars bars are aligned along the waterside at Boat Quay. These bars and restaurants are mostly old shop houses which have been conserved. The cosmopolitan banking sector lies behind Boat Quay. The parliament house is located opposite to Boat quay.
There are Conserved shop-houses that line both sides of Circular Road at Boat Quay.

The night view of the restaurants and pubs along the Singapore River are wonderful and enjoyable. Also there are several Sculptures at Boat Quay that depict activities carried out on the banks of Singapore River in the 19th and 20th century. There are light and fountain shows during the evenings at Boat Quay. An evening stroll at Boat Quay with a drink or two is a great option."
,,Brilliant atmosphere,5.0,,"What a great place in the evening.its so busy I think people come straight from work for a meal or drink with friends .we walked right along to the end and got a table overlooking the river.We were at the Victorian London pub and the penny black next door had a few drinks ,the service was great even though they guys were rushed off their feet so busy ,serving meals as well,they still looked after us very well.Hubby had the Guinness which he said was really good pint,as it can vary I stuck to my white wine.we stayed about two hours and watched the ferries going by ,all lit up loads of them ,they were full as well,nice to watch as the place come to life and the skyline is amazing when it gets dark.we enjoyed happy hour here ."
,,Very good atmosphere,5.0,,Wonderful bars and restaurants with live music. Reasonably priced food and drink and all ages there. We had a great firework display too..lighted boats sail past added to the atmosphere.
,,Excellent walk along the river to see the sights or eat.,5.0,,"Clarke Quay and Boat Quay run into each other and both are a gastronomic eating strip. The food is good, it's a bit of a hassle walking along here at night if you just want to look as the sprukers will stop you at each restaurant tempting you in and if you say you don't want to eat then they will say come in and have a drink then. But just keeping walking and you will be fine. Often there is something going on actually on the river at Boat Quay some kind of show or other and just to walk along and see all the bridge which crisscross the river with all their lights on is worth a look."
,,Lively,4.0,,"Great place to visit in the evening, always lots happening. Traders can be a bit of a pain as they constantly try and get you into their establishments though."
,,Interesting mix of food and shophouse architecture,4.0,,"I enjoy the view of the river and you're spoilt for choice of the food offerings here. There's German, Indian, Korean and seafood for you to choose from. Anyway you're seated, you get a good scenic view of the financial district and the river. Or if you just want to watch the boats go by with a pint, that's perfect too!"
,,Simply Fantastic,5.0,,This is a unique place on the planet. It is full of little restaurant and drink lounges overviewing the river. It is a MUST plase to visit while in Singapore.
,,Great place to end the day!,4.0,,"This place is all about nightlife; it is where locals and tourists come at night to enjoy some drinks and food. It is safe, and unlike similar areas around Asia not a lot of “shady” activities are going on."
,,My goto place in Singapore,4.0,,"Sit by the river & enjoy the delicious food from a variety of restaurants/cuisines available. The Beautiful view of CBD area adds up to the experience. Couple of places offer live screening of Football/Cricket matches, if you're a sport fan & enjoy watching your favorite team play, sitting in a pub/bar"
,,Historic,5.0,,"Very historic area, awesome to see all the old buildings lined up the river. Cool place to go for dinner by the river."
,,Old and new in harmony,4.0,,"Continuing our casual walk along the south western bank of the Singapore river we came to Boat Quay a restored area of old riverside buildings with a backdrop of present day concrete monoliths towering over them - plenty of benches to sit and take in the river which did have much traffic and lots of restaurants, mostly tourist orientated as you approach the Elgin Bridge which you can walk under and then on to Clarke Quay opposite"
,,An interesting location,4.0,,"If you plan a stay in Singapore, visit the Boat Quay just to get a good feel of the area and enjoy the many excellent Bars and Restaurants all nearby."
,,Boat Quay,4.0,,Cool place with lots of little restaurants to explore. Picturesque. Awesome place for a wander. Definitely worth a visit
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"Boat Quay is one of my best place in Singapore for Dining.
You will find plenty of fine dining restaurant along with riverside.
You can find many good Indian restaurants. My favourite Indian restaurant at Boat Quay is Haldi Indian restaurant.they serve very delicious food.
I am sure will like this place.

Best time to visit this place is during evening time.

Regards
Chandrashekar"
,,Bets hangout place,5.0,,"Good pubs around the river area , closer to metro stations and office spaces , at night the place just lights up with good offers on drinks and quick service , a long stretch of pubs and restaurants , sea foods are available at a discounted price and u can bargain too"
,,Holiday,4.0,,Cute area walking distance on the river from Robertson and Clarke quays Great place for a drink on the way back from a walk to city museum or art gallery Older and more historic feel to the other quays
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"Nice area to visit even if only for a short period. It's a mix of commercial properties, many fine restaurants and bars, hotels, etc and is a historical area on the South Bank of the river stretching from the shophouses at UOB Centre to Elgin Bridge. The Quay dates to 1842 when it was built to accommodate the shipping trade. Nice views from the river while on the cruise."
,,Ancient and modern Singapore,4.0,,"Every time I come to Singapore, I always come to this place. There are many restaurants for tourists and behind there are many tall buildings of financial institutions. Boat Quay is the place where the ancient and the modern Singapore meet."
,,Lots of action,5.0,,"Great options for supper and drinks. Outstanding place to people watch. Also, a good place to start and venture to the other ‘quays’"
,,Great Bars,5.0,,"Great location, great bars and an overall great vibe We hit the strip at Happy Hour and got cheep beer and cheap wine with a beautiful view of the Singapore River"
,,Must visit in the evening!!,5.0,,"Loved this place very much, many bars and clubs around here. Better plan in the evening after sunset."
,,Great Choice of Bars & Restaurants,4.0,,"A bustling “strip” of bars & restaurants in the heart of Singapore on the edge of the river!
Great Asian restaurants, good themed bars, lots of people & a great atmosphere!
A must to visit this place when in Singapore, but note liquor is very expensive, plan for Happy Hour.
So many restaurants to choose from, we enjoyed an Indian restaurant on the 5th floor with superb views across the city."
,,Bustling reatsuarant strip near the river,3.0,,It is nice to sit by the river over an evening drink. The spruikers work hard to attract you to their patch. But the food is nothing special and the prices are quite high. You can do better.
,,A tourist precinct,3.0,,"If you visit Boat Quay for what it is, a riverside drinking & dining precinct primarily of the western tourist market, then you probably won’t be too disappointed. But it’s nothing more than this.

The location is stunning and on a nice balmy night (which is almost every night) it is nice to walk along the river and see the brightly painted buildings and their bright LED flashing signs. But venture just a little further down the road, to one of the more local street food venues and you will be richly rewarded. By better food at significantly lower prices.

Not as crass as Clarke Quay, but no that far off."
,,Dinner with a view,4.0,,This area is great for having a nice dinner right beside the Singapore river while enjoying the lights and music from everywhere or you can simply enjoy a drink with friends in one of these many bars around you
,,cool place,4.0,,"Nice weather especially at night breezy relaxing ambiance. Pricey food places, touristy in fact. But overall you need to experience this place especially at night."
,,Riverside,3.0,,"This ""attraction"" has been around for a long time, about 25 years or more. Just at the fringe of the CBD, many workers come here for lunch. Then expats and locals come here after work for drinks, and tourists come here too"
,,One hell of a night,4.0,,"Absolutely worth it. A bit expensive but trust me, boat quay isn't going to disappoint you at all. Visit here during the evening after 1900 hours. Dine with a view. There are a chain of bars and pubs if you want to visit..that too categorised into different countries."
,,Beautiful beautiful beautiful!,5.0,,This is a must visit place for anyone even for a short while in Singapore. The restaurants are great even though bit expensive. Lunch time deals are great and there’s a nice lively vibe during evenings and nights. Awesome views from roof top restaurants as well!
,,Turistic but beautiful,4.0,,Yes the place is touristic (especially near the famous Merlion) but if you do the whole walk around the bay (1h - 1h30) you will have access to different views that change as a function of the day light..
,,"Great view, bustling restaurants by the river side",5.0,,"The Boat Quay stretch is lined with restaurants & bars, conveniently located along the river. This offers a great view for patrons and tourists."
,,Touristy but worth a visit,4.0,,"Quayside full of restaurants and bars, quality is variable but fun place to visit in the evenings, however you will be accosted every 3 steps by every restaurant owner inviting you to enter their restaurant or bar. Displays of live crabs impressive but prices for chilli crab are also increased."
,,The,5.0,,"The Singapore Boat Quay is a way to cool down in tropical Singapore. Go for shopping, food or a boat ride. Boat rides are really nice at night to take in the amazing city lights."
,,Restaurants on the river side,3.0,,"A place to dine along the riverside, however, also the most touristic place in Singapore. Remember to check out the places here on TripAdvisor before eating there. There are so many other nice places to eat in Singapore that I would not recommend eating there. Prices are high with average quality food."
,,Chilli crab,3.0,,The place has a good atmosphere with lots of restaurants to chose from; we tried a couple of restaurants here to eat chilli crab; not cheap don’t expect much change out of S$300 but good place to visit
,,"One restaurant can bring the whole place down - a shame, but reputations take ages to build and moments to lose",1.0,,"We (tried to) eat at the Harvester Chinese restaurant. Seating was shared with the Indian restaurant next door. Clearly the Chinese maître d' claimed ownership of our patronage over the Indian chap. But we were to be sitting in the Indian section and drinking his beer. We order food from the Chinese shop. Waited. Waited. Waited. We had some fried rice and some chicken and vegatables. But when we asked where was the duck (the proud s[peciality) we got: ""coming"". Waited, Waited. Waited. Asked them again: ""coming"". Eventually we got up to ask where was it, another waitress said: ""Oh. Sorry. We gave the last one to that table over there"" ""But they arrived after us and we have been waiting 20 minutes, you kept saying it was coming"" Shrugged shoulders. ""There is no more"" Absolutely unbelievable. No sincere apology from the maître d'. Just told us we were finished and he would get our bill. Do not eat at the Harvest Restaurant."
,,"Eat, drink and play",4.0,,"The Boat Quay is opposite Clark Quay and boasts places like Jumbo Seafood, Harry’s and Brewerkz. A tourist and expat place for sure but nevertheless a fun place to visit to eat, drink and play."
,,very touristy,4.0,,A very touristy part of Singapore. You beter of to find restaurants away from this part as most of them are overpriced and the quality and service is not the same as in other places in Singapore. Great area to people (tourist) watch especially at night. Plus a great view of the Marina Kay Hotel at night for their light show
,,River Cruise in Singapore River,4.0,,"The Singapore River is the one of heritage, history and the core of Singapore’s transformation from sleepy fishing old village to modern metropolis. River Cruise in Singapore River by Boat Quay take on a voyage through Singapore’s historic moments to sail the route taken by bumboat or eco-friendly electric boat. Ticket price for this journey is around S$15 (child) till S$25 (adult) and tour operations subject to weather and tidal conditions."
,,Night trip,4.0,,Our night trip around the Bay was well worth the trip. Seeing the city from the water at night was magical.
,,Amazing location and attraction,5.0,,"Superb views and clean spot of architecture. Layout is fabulous and I would definitely recommend it for all visitors. You can enjoy a day literally just walking through the various bars, restaurants, activities within and then watch a beautiful sunset behind the highrise buildings. The place is full of civilization and touristic aspects. I adore the boat quay and I hope to visit again.

Some pictures taken around the Quay."
,,Plenty of places to eat and drink,4.0,,"This is one of the more vibrant areas you are likely to find in Singapore City. With a whole range of pubs, clubs and other bars, there is plenty to do by the riverside with most staying open until the early hours.

This area is most certainly going to be popular and worthwhile when watching the World Cup 2018 next month!

We noted at least two seafood restaurants, a British-style Victorian pub, a McDonald’s and a few Gentleman’s Clubs among plenty of others along the waterfront."
,,Awesome food,4.0,,"Nice Ambience and Quality Indian food. Must visit and try Chicken Tikka, Paneer chilli Dry, Mango Lassi."
,,Boat Quay - Great river views and great eats and watering holes,4.0,,This is definitely a place to unwind from work or to satisfy your tummies or just to pause to see the world go by with a good beer in your hand. Great for get together in a casual environment in the evenings and night time. A convenient place near the business centre and downtown area too. Let the pictures convince you.
,,A lovely place for dinner.,5.0,,"Boat Quay is a great place to visit after a hot day, playing tourist and to enjoy a cold beer and dinner seated out on the edge of the Singapore River, enjoying the alfresco atmosphere. With all the bridges brilliantly lit at night, it is such a picturesque scene."
,,River Side Restaurants,5.0,,Boat Quay is famous for its river side restaurants and also an place where you can grab a boat to explore the Singapore river and the Marina bay. Its busy during lunch hours but busier over dinner.
,,Nice place to eat...but be cautious,4.0,,"If you are looking for a place to eat on the bay which won't require you to remortgage your house. This is probably the place. Informal, bustling and eclectic atmosphere and lots of food to choose from. However, check reviews first and don't be drawn in too easily by the waiters who will accost you. Once you are confident a place looks good, there is something else to watch out for and that's the prices. There are quite a few tricks which can be pulled to convince you a dish is a good deal when it is actually a total rip off. Check and double check what you are getting and how much it costs. If you are ordering prawns, is the price for one or for a plate? If they are offering complementary extras, are they really complementary or do they cost extra? If you follow those rules, it's a great place."
,,Are you hungry,5.0,,"After visiting the Merlion on our Friday evening river walk the next place we came to was Boat Quay, what a super atmosphere & so many restaurants to chose from along the quay with seating along the river bank."
,,Lovely historic quay,4.0,,"Lovely area to eat in the evening, lots of small restaurants with tables at the water edge. Great to just sit and people watch while having a drink."
,,Great place,5.0,,I love this place you can get hassled by the waiters trying to pull in the customers but just a polite “No Thank You” is all it takes. There is a wide choice of food and drinks available
,,River side Dining Pleasure,4.0,,Right adjacent to the Raffles Place on the river side street is known as Boat Quay. The river bank is laced with eateries and bars. We visited the area in the afternoon and had dinner at night. The walk on the street is pleasant. There are plenty of restaurants with different cuisines. Almost every shop has an extended sitting area across the street on the river bank. Some shops display living seafood like crabs at their respective counters. There are some bars with interesting names! Quite a few shops serve Indian dishes. The area is clean and well lit. Our dinner at ‘Kinara’ was enjoyable. The evening lights and their amazing reflections on the rippling waters created a cool and bright atmosphere.
,,Evening and day walk,4.0,,Walked here during the day it surely will be more lovely during night as its tourist spot just for walking around
,,Great spot for Dinner and drinks,4.0,,Boat Quay and Clark Quay is a great spot to chill out with friends . Good pubs and restaurants . Mainly a tourist area but also visited by locals . Night time is buzzing here . During Day worth a boat trip around quay to learn more of the history of this area .
,,Boat Quay at night,5.0,,"This is the 2nd review of Boat Quay after a gap of almost one year. Earlier review mainly highlights the historical evolution of this area near Singapore river. Photographs taken earlier were in full daylight. This visit to the place was at night time. We started from the office around 6 pm to have us in this area & finished it at Song Fa Bak Kut Teh restaurant at new bridge road. After dinner we decided to walk until Fullerton hotel & catch a taxi from there.

It was a slow walk of about 15 minutes but we enjoyed it. The bridges & surrounding was illuminated as if like a festive season. Subway passing below the road was lighted like a studio. Restaurants on one side & river on the other with occasional passing of boat of river cruise gave it a flavor of typical tourist destination.

We stopped outside many restaurants displaying their live sea food offering. It was tempting but we were done for the day. Laser beams from top of Marina Bay Sands reminded us of the daily free show going on out there. This place gets more crowded over the weekends & as compared to daytime it is much cooler at night."
,,"Nice location to see, and drink during happy hour, but not rip off food",4.0,,"It really is a nice place by the river, with old houses turned pubs and restaurants. Beware of the restaurants here, it is OK do drink otherwise if you insist on eating here, becarful what you order because what you see is not what you order, e.g you see on the menu a plate of 4 big prawns for 28 Sin.Dol. and you think you will get 4 prawns for 28 dol, actually what you will pay is 28 x 4: 112 dol. So ask questions, read fine prints behind the menu, know that you will pay for the wet napkins and the nuts brought to your table at the beginning. If you think that you are ripped off call the owner and tell him what you have thought you ate and pay. Otherwise enjoy the happy hour between 5-8 PM by the river. Final note: ask the waiter to show you the glass size for your beer."
,,"Good venue for informal restaurants, bars by the water",4.0,,"I was staying at a nearby hotel and strolled down to the Boat Quay to grab a drink, an evening meal and enjoy the views of the river. I've been here a few times before and, on this last occasion, on the last day of the Chinese New Year celebrations, it was nice to see the full moon rising in the distance over the spectacular Marina Bay Sands hotel just visible between the high rise buildings.

The restaurants here are all very much the same and a few have enthusiastic waiters/waitresses trying to coax you in. There are also a number of busy, noisy bars and the odd establishment with scantily clad young ladies beckoning you in.

I focused on a nice meal at a table directly on the bank of the river.

Not bad for a change but it would have been more fun if I'd gone there as a group."
,,Great location ..... only time in Singapore I felt ripped off,3.0,,"Lovey place with wall to wall restaurants all hustling you to come in. Most serving the same stuff with different combinations of offers on. We got a whopping 20% discount (others offered a free beer or similar) .....the food was a long way from being the best I’ve had in Singapore but it did take the prize for being the most expensive. And even now I don’t really know how that happened! My guess is that it is the extras for towel-wipes, peanuts and probably the cutlery.

Great for a beer watching the boats and the sun going down but would not eat there again."
,,Great place to hangout with friends,4.0,,Boat Quay is a great place to hangout with friends enjoying icey cold drink or a chilli mud crab. Restaurant tables overlooking Singapore river to sit at and take in the views. While walking along the river take notice of the many sculptures of the years passed.
,,nice,4.0,,The boat quay is a beautiful place to spend your evening walking around. it's clean and there are a lot of restaurants in the area.
,,enjoyable place to visit,4.0,,"I really enjoy the whole area known as Boat Quay. In particular, I enjoy either taking a boat or strolling the side of the Singapore River. Both offer so much to view and take in. This most recent time I particularly enjoyed walking along the river and viewing the many statues depicting old Singapore including the River Merchants or the children jumping into the water. I seemed to not notice these sculptures in years passed when I was in this area. But I paid careful attention this time to all the details and art work which Boat Quay has to offer and I loved it. Would not hesitate in taking a similar walk in the future next time to enjoy the sights sounds of the area."
,,The name is interesting,5.0,,Well we had heard about Clark Quay and this place just matched with that ... Not as big and happening as Clarke Quay but this place has its own charm ... lovely food too
,,A pleasant enough backdrop for an evening drink,3.0,,I wouldn't really describe it as an attraction but a pleasant enough backdrop with a small lake with electric boats floating around and garish colours projected upon bridges and skyscapers alike in that special Disneyfied world with plenty of police that is Singapore
,,Great place to hangout in the evening,4.0,,"Aside from Clark Quay, Boat Quay is another great place to hang out at night. Comprising restaurants, cafes and pubs with tables overlooking the river this is a perfect place to come and end the day after a hard days touring, or even after a hard day's work for those working in the Shenton Way and commercial district.

We really like the Penny Black pub which reminds me very much of pubs in London, and will try some of the other places on our next trip which is under planning at the moment."
,,Great Walk .. Lots of Restuarants,5.0,,This place is at its best at night when the lights are on and to walk just adjacent to the river with lots of restaurant options to eat at night.. really Loved this place. Specially the theme that every restaurant has their own cool outdoor seating area at Boat Quay.
,,Touristy,3.0,,It’s very touristy and just a pedestrianised walkway near Clark Quay along the Singapore river. Lots of bars and restaurants but a bit run down and shame the buildings look so tired and very touristy and pushy waiters trying to get you in. Nice that you can sit and see the wonderful skyline of Singapore and also it’s got the financial centre just behind it. We stopped for a drink it nothing special.
,,walk singapore,5.0,,Lovely spot to walk around. Very pretty and picturesque spot. Has a lot of great restaurants and was within walking distance of our hotel. Great atmosphere
,,Poor Image For Singapore,2.0,,"Takiness is not what Singapore does, in general. Neither does it do drunken sexist western louts. Come here if you must but avoid evenings especially. The bar/restaurants are full of dreadful drunken 'oiks' swilling lager and on the look-out for tarty women. A bad advert for westerners for sure but also for Singapore. Consequently the bar-restaurants are over-priced, inclined to rip-off practices and certainly not very good compared to what you can find elsewhere. My worst night in Singapore - ever!"
,,My favorite place,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for more than a month and this is one place which I visited almost every week or even twice in some weeks. Boat quay overlooks the Singapore river and has a lot of, really a lot of options to eat and drink at the river bank and some are very cheap. I would personally recommend the Prince of Wales for beer and snacks. They have some very nice offers on Asahi (3 for S$15). This place is exactly what you need after a long day, it is ultimately relaxing and offers great food,drinks and service. A must visit for tourists also but visit at evening for an amazing experience."
,,Romantic,5.0,,For dinner its better than Clarke quay as its more quite & romantic . Moreover with children its better as not so crowded and not loud music
,,Amasing Singapore,3.0,,"Considering it as one of turist attraction and not only the place to eat, it must be visited. We came by foot from previous boat station. It is intersting to see the place from other side of the river before you enter in restaurant area. There are restaurants with different kind of cousin and different level (price), but common is ""aggresive"" invitation in front of any restaurant. They do not let you check the menu on the entrance but insist with invitation and borrong question ""where are you from"" to understand probably what kind of strategy to use to force you to enter. Despite different restaurants the offer is very similar and prices are too high for such level but there is no choices."
,,Endless supply of customers from the neighbouring financial institutions,4.0,,"Bars and restaurants line the southern bank of the Singapore River, together with what seems like an endless supply of customers from the neighbouring financial institutions.
As with the other quays for the leisure and relaxation areas of Singapore, there are some excellent restaurants, most which have outdoor dinning, over amplified music and river view seating.
Easy place to reach by public transport / taxis."
,,Singapore at its best,4.0,,"Whether you are dining alfresco, strolling or just sitting down by the river bank watching the river boats amble by, the experience will leave you relaxed and rejuvenated amidst the hustle and bustle of the financial district. This place certainly encapsulates the best of Singapore, from the preservation of the historic buildings along the river bank to the transformation of a derelict and dirty river into a world-class attraction. As long as you are not too bothered by the hot and humid weather, Boat Quay is an experience that you should not miss on your next visit to Singapore."
,,Relaxing,4.0,,Amazing place to relax with friends and families. Good food and drink options available here and on circular road which is at the back of Boat Quay. Try Chilli Crab here in any restaurant.
,,River Festival,5.0,,There was a festival on when we were in Singapore and we watched the Dragon boats racing from a Chinese restaurant along Boat Quay. It was very interesting.
,,Dine by the River.,5.0,,"If you are looking to enjoy a quiet meal by the Singapore riverside, take a stroll along boat quay after 7pm when the tems drop and a cool breeze picks up. You'll find a variety of ethnic bars and restaurants to please all tastes. Before making your decision as to which one to choose it is suggested that you negotiate with the staff member on duty for 20% discount and the first round of drinks Free. This is par for the course if you are in the know!"
,,Nice by river,4.0,,Nice place for a walk by Singapore River. Some fish restaurants in old part of town with seating areas beside water. Can walk from here to see other landmarks.
,,Dinner Place !,4.0,,"This place is ideal for a night walk with friends. Lots of Clubs, Restaurants and Pubs are there. You can find plenty of Thai, Chinese, Singaporean cuisine restaurants. Can enjoy the city lights and view of Marina Bay Laser Show."
,,Forum provides great food and excellent service,4.0,,Have visited Forum down at Boat Quay of 3 occasions and it has provided consistently good food with friendly and efficient service. Can recommend this as one of THE best places to eat on Boat Quay
,,Awrsome,5.0,,"A absolute must ..great views, great for pictures and very nice to relax. Again...a relly must. Also doable with wherlchair"
,,Just Another Attraction,3.0,,"The area by the river (stagnant) has been very thoughtfully developed. It is famous for its vibrant, vivacious night life and ambience, and plathora of eatries and bars. It is a must in every tourists' check list as it has a life of its own.

Personally we had highly over priced mediocre Indian food, but we had fantastc cokpany so no crib. There is an icecream vendor who is very popular for his histronics than ice cream. Enjoy the ice cream treat here.

Towads one end there are two rides as Extreme Sport. Safe but requires guts. Enjoy the rides skip the photos (buy only if the right expression is captured). Cheers"
,,Pleasent and calm place....with a cup of your drink,4.0,,Very nice place for late night outings.... Varieties of non-veg dishes with your choice of drink is available...... Very soothing... place in Singapore
,,Great Place to Meet Friends,5.0,,"It's all about casual dinning and bars including a number of roof top bars.

It's separated from Clarke Quay by only a bridge and is smaller and more understated. It provides many casual restaurants and bars along the riverbank with some fabulous rooftop bars.

From here to can continue to walk along the river towards the Marina Sands area where there is a wonderful viewing area of the Marina Sands lighting show across the harbor. It's definitely worth the 10 minute walk at night."
,,Lots of nice lunch places,4.0,,Boat key is the place where historically all the merchants arrived by boat to trade their goods. It has recently been renovated and hosts many nice restaurants. For us it’s a regular lunch spot.

,,atmosphere,5.0,,Great place for food and drinks ... buzzing with load of restaurants much like Clarke Quay Harry bar very good
,,Coloured lights reflecting on water.,4.0,,"There are two distinct sides to the river, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay.
Boat Quay is for every age, whereas the other quay is mostly for younger, upwardly mobile people who love loud music.Boat Quay has a great range of bars and eating houses all packed with British, Australian and American ex pats who tend to work in the sky scrapers of the Financial district.two quite famous bars are at the very start of thr Quay are The Penny Black, this is a London pub where you can buy Favourites like pie and Chips,Sausage and mash etc.Next door is the famous Harry's bar,made famous by Nick Leeson's film,about the man who brought down Barings bank.Other bars on the Quay sell fish in tanks, you select what you fancy, and it is taken out and cooked on the spot.At night tourist boats cruise the river covered in coloured lights,
which like all the lights from the hotels, bars and public buildings reflect in the black waters. A must to visit at least once at night and possibly another day time visit to see the range of statues such as Stanford Raffles who founded Singapore plus many more."
,,Worth a visit and a bite to eat.,4.0,,"We came here twice. On the Friday night we ate Chinese and the Sunday night they offered Free drinks to us just to get us in the door. Lots of choices to choose from, just depends on what you feel like. There is seating inside and out. Its nice just to stroll along and get the feel for it if you don't want to eat anything."
,,Nice easy style and ok,4.0,,"It‘s the cheaper variation to the clarke quay.. it‘s also very alived there.. also a little noisy, but not disturbing noisy.. the restaurants are mixed with brs together.. so on the one side you have a quite restaurant and on the other side you have a loud beer bar for example.. if you like to go eat or drinking does not matter, go there.."
,,Best place to eat and drink in Singapore,4.0,,Boat Quay is probably the best place to eat and drink outdoors in Singapore. Many good bars and restaurants.
,,Interesting vibrant part of the City on the Singapore River,4.0,,"The River has three main quays, this is the first one you will encounter as you walk along the River from Marina Bay and the Fulllerton Hotel. It is on the opposite side of the River from Clarke Quay. It is bound by my two favorite bridges Cavenaugh Bridge and Elgin Bridge.

This place was the main center of commerce until the 1960's and has slowly transformed to its current state of being a major entertainment district with a wide variety of popular (well deserved) bars and restaurants. it is quite touristy in every regard from the tourists checking it out, from the families walking through the area and shopping and/or looking for just the right spot to go into, to the fairly aggressive touts trying to get you to come to their place.

The food is consistently good and so are the bars, tourist level expensive too. Note that during the day, there is not a lot of shade at these places, so these are better at the end of the day and into the evening when the sun is down and the place is about 10 degrees cooler if not more.

Also, I read that there are some great places without the tourist shtick a block or two from this Quay. I checked them out and found this to be true, in fact with better restaurants it seemed and where there were more tourists seemingly in the know at those places versus getting sucked into Boat Quay or Clarke Quay a little further down.

Just behind this is Raffles Place by the way.

Again, like everywhere, this Quay and both bridges present many wonderful photo ops both of the water scene, and nearby buildings and skyline.

Note too that there is a small bronze statue of some jumping children purportedly jumping into the River at Cavenaugh Bridge. Some people call it 'drain cats"". Also worth seeking out while at Boat Quay. Some great photo ops there too. There is a boat stop too at this Quay, so you can get on or off the River boats at this Quay also.

Definitely worth seeking out on any visit to Singapore."
,,One of the finest place to eat sea food,5.0,,"Cool place to hang out, have LOTS of sea food excellent drinks and supercool music and lights This place is best for two person or one person who wants to chill out and have great food ."
,,Better than Clark Quay,4.0,,"Boat Quay has a more genuine, old Singapore vibe than Clark Quay, even though it is still rather tourist-orientated. You can however find a great variety of food and drink choices here, and the overall vibe is very charming. Worth checking out!"
,,3/5,2.0,,Positives: - old world architecture Negatives: - has lost charm by too much tourism - most restaurants and bars too expensive here now
,,Forum Restaurant Great Food Shocking Service,3.0,,"So Boat Quay is all about restaurants by the river. Chinese, Thai, Indian. A lot of effort goes into hooking passers-by. Sadly at Forum restaurant the service was awful. We ordered coffee but it turned out they had none (though it appeared on the bill later). We had sweet and sour chicken, braised beef noodles, Singapore seafood noodles and Peking duck (half). Service was slow, surly, virtually non-existent. We got a single plate of food but no chopsticks or cutlery nor plates each for another 10 minutes. Really the worst service. But the food FANTASTIC the best we had on our trip. Excellent chef. Get some staff? On the other hand one thing that marked out Singapore in general - poor sulky service, and silly rules."
,,Relax dine and walk,4.0,,this place is THE place to take a gentle stroll and walk admiring the beauty of the Singapore skyline and financial centre. There are many nice resturantson the Raffles Place side. You can also catch a boat to get a different view of Singapore. There are two historic bridges namely the Elgin and Cavenagh on the northern and southern end. Dont go during lunch time as there are not shade. Ther are a few nice sculptures on the Raffles place side. Many alfresco restaurants dot this side of the river bank.
,,Gentle walk of peace,4.0,,"Its a pleasant peaceful walk in the boat quay.Except for mid noon! Its a nice place to sit around doing nothing by the side of the river, eating ice cream,popcorn,chatting around. Nice place i liked it."
,,beautiful place,5.0,,"walking down the river lined with restaurants during the day, theres a sense of peace and serenity surrounding the area. at night, the place is packed with tourists and working crowd alike. a great place to hang out."
,,Good choice anytime for a visit!,4.0,,We had dinner along the Singapore River @ Boat Quay. This area offers a large variety of restaurants with different food selections and bars. River views of the city skyline is also a speciality. A very popular night spot area sightseeing and just sitting. People also use it for strolling or eating takeout along the waterfront to enjoy some people watching. Photo opportunities of the sights and smells of this fabulous city available in many directions!
,,"Nice walk, don't go to Clarke quay",3.0,,"You can see the touristy bustle of clarke quay from here, has similar restaurants, but less carnival. good spots to see the river and downtown too!"
,,Dinner,4.0,,Great place to bring friends to feel the atmosphere of the singapore river bank where restaurants are set by the edge of the river. Nice view of surrounding buildings lit in the night. A good range of foods and drinks are be be had; however ask prices first before ordering to avoid misunderstandings.
,,"Unique place, must see",5.0,,"This is an historical site in Singapore. In the old days boats anchored here, todau there are bars and restaurants with a huge variety. Ask the cost for a meal before sitting down, since especially the sea food is expensive overthere whilst prices are not advertised."
,,Chill out,4.0,,"Not been here for close to 10 years and as I was staying nearby, came over for a few drinks.

Much busier than when I was last here, more restaurants and a different mix of people (loads more tourists).

Still good to have a few drinks and watch the world go by."
,,The same as clarke quay,3.0,,A lot of restaurants. Crowded with people who are looking for some food/diner. Cool place especially during 18:00-23:00
,,Best Place To Eat In Town,5.0,,"Boat Quay was one of our favourite places to relax in Singapore. There are beautiful views of the river and the boats moored by it's side. It has loads of nice restaurant and bars and has a lovely atmosphere.
Great place to watch the sunset as the skyscrapers begin to light up. Magical ambience.
I'd recommend it at anytime though, not just sunset. It's lovely to sit a d watch the boats go past on the river and the people mosey along the bankside walk. Definitely make tine in your itinerary for at least one vidit to Boat Quay."
,,Great Lunch,5.0,,There are many restaurants and bars along the riverfront. They all offer good dining specials. We enjoyed a bite to eat with our family after a nice walk along the riverfront
,,Good choice of restaurants,4.0,,A nice river walk and a good choice of different types of restaurants but can get very crowded on weekends.

,,"Great spot for a walk, food and drinks",4.0,,"Between Marina Bay and Clarke Quay there is Boat Quay which after visiting I prefer to Clarke Quay as it had a better choice for food and drinks and also had much better views.

Great place to take a break day or night, although at night it does get much busier and louder."
,,Relaxing Cruise,5.0,,Like all boat cruises in many cities this is a good choice when in Singapore. It is a good experience and you can see a lot of the city buildings during the cruise.
,,Very touristy but wonderfull views,4.0,,This road is a very tourist trap road.i didnt saw locals there but the prices was ok and the view was beautiful.be carefull for tourist traps and you will be ok.after 9 pm is happy hour with discounted prices for drinks
,,Perfect evening destination - Singapore Boat Quay,5.0,,"Boat Quay area of Singapore is my personal favorite for a relaxed evening walk/jog or drinks/dinner - next to tranquil waters of Singapore river and balmy breeze of Marina Bay. Chime from neighboring clock tower or Laser light show from Marina Bay Sands adds to the enjoyment!! For gastronomy followers, there's a variety of pubs, eateries offering diverse global & local drinks/cuisine......there is something for everyone at Boat Quay!!"
,,Dine along the river,5.0,,This place is recommended for dinner. A row of nice restaurants that set up their tables outside along the river create a beautiful ambience. Great setting to dine and has varied cuisine choices
,,Near central business district,3.0,,"boats, bars, restaurants and near the central business district..good to have a few beers and dinner at night...next to the river !!..its relaxing but might get very hot during the day time !!..plan your visit !"

,,lots of restaurants and bars,4.0,,"good place to visit either for lunch or dinner its near the financial district, so many restaurants, bars and flavours from other countries as well."
,,At least some places were open..,3.0,,"The Bronze statues on the way there are very good, especially the group of boys jumping into the river. There were a few places open for lunch, some more expensive than others. Nowhere seems to do the fresh Lime/Lemon juice or fresh iced lemon tea available everywhere else - a big disappointment for me.
We did stop for lunch at Marina Seafood.
The views were good. They need to make more of this area for daytime."
,,Tropical mood,5.0,,"Boat Quay is fabulous. Close proximity to the CBD of Singapore. Restaurants galore, beautiful restaurant architecture. The Singapore River is at your feet. Beautiful to stroll along and take in all that Singapore has to offer. Not to be missed."
,,Enjoyable & relaxing,5.0,,Boat Quay offers visitors some fun things to do on nice old boats; it's cool to observe the riverside which is enjoyable & relaxing; sometime it's quite hot though during mid day.
,,Good views by land and water,5.0,,Plenty of interesting buildings and sights here along with places to eat. Exploring on foot gave good access to all areas while looking at it from a boat gave really good insight into the variations in building types.A great deal of history is attached to this area and information is readily available
,,Awesome Place for couple,4.0,,"Boat Quay just great for couple, if you love to have a Seafood Dinner with your love one, this is the place."
,,Avoid .. overpriced food and too many hustlers.,2.0,,"Boat quay had its time. While you still might find rare good places but overall is a place for average tasting overpriced food. Seafood is way overpriced. Be careful for whatever comes to your table as napkins, peanuts will all make their way to your bill.
Haggle for food, places will easily offer 50% off price for food. Can you believe it?"
,,Must have one dinner at Boat Quay while in Singapore,5.0,,"Boat Quay – Several decades ago this was the place where trading was an everyday affair of grains & goods arriving by boats & shop houses which are dotting the river front (now restaurants) used to be warehouses with lot of coolies around due to requirement of their manual labor.
Location – Located just above Raffles Place MRT station this place is a tourist & local attraction now & the river is quite cleaned up. During the day, nothing much happens but as the sun goes down it comes alive & becomes a happening place until last order around 10 pm & may be later over the weekend.
How to reach – It can be reached by various public transport options (Train, buses as well as taxis). If it is raining you better carry an umbrella because the approach road from all the sides is pretty open.
Nearby – From here you can walk to Clarke Quay which is another recently upgraded riverfront with lot of happenings & connected by a walkway. On the other side of the river is Supreme court building & a museum. There is a Chinese temple nearby & you can walk to the famous merlion via Fullerton hotel which was a main post office during British era.
Size – A stretch houses close to 100 bars & restaurants. You name it they have it Thai, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian, Western etc. Kinara restaurant is my favorite & if you book in advance they will reserve a seat for you by the river for your dinner. The food quality is consistent for over two decades since it has been there.
Attractions – The movie Rogue Trade covers the watering hole of the hero which is the 1st one from train side but there are few other good places like Irish Pub, live seafood display, Sheesha place, several sports bars & back alleys have Karaoke type of joints."
,,"Lovely area with small, authentic restaurants right on the rivers edge",5.0,,"So many small, authentic restaurants to choose from, right on the rivers edge. Unfortunately I can't remember the exact restaurant we ate in but really don't think you could go wrong. Lovely ambiance to the place with wee Chinese lanterns just adding to the views"
,,Love the Quay and eateries across the edges,4.0,,"It's a nice evening stroll or more serious run place which transforms to an amazing area with nightlife and bustling energy every night. Love the vibes and the eateries across. Lovely to walk across the bridges, do people watching, grab a coffee and even read a book. The night lighting is great and it's always busy and energetic."
,,waterfront on the river,5.0,,"we enjoyed walking around the boat quay - you can cross over to the other side easily enough on s couple of walking bridges. both sides have attractions but the Boat Quay is most known for the many restaurants lining the one side. Prices are not for the faint of heart.at those restaurants but as they say - location, location, location."
,,Try Singapore's Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour with Transfer!,5.0,,"My husband and I have gone to Singapore a number of times and we have never used a tour. This trip we decided on the Singapore's Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour with Transfer. Well it was the best decision we made in this trip. This night tour gave us 4 hours of experience, fun, excitement and thrill. Firstly we visited a medical hall and learned about traditional Chinese medicine, and we were given an insect repellent ointment each as a souvenir! We were then free to walk through the bustling Night Market given a specific time! Then we went to an included dinner at a local Chinese restaurant, and we were given a choice of meat or vegetarian. This gave us a chance to interact with the rest of the people in the tour group. Then came the thrill of riding the trishaw on their bustling Chinatown streets! Most of their riders were elderly but they were very fit! They took us to Clark Quay and this to me is the highlight! We learned about the history of Singapore’s Chinatown, cruise along the Singapore River on a bumboat and watch the city skyline lit up! We had a lady tour guide with some 14 years experience and she was very friendly, knew her stuff and made our trip very comfortable! I highly recommend this tour to everyone!"
,,Yum yum,4.0,,"Had dinner here on our last night in Singapore. Food was delicious though a little pricey as is most of the eating places in Singapore.
What a great spot to take in the night city line and would thoroughly recommend this. The ladies that attended to us were lovely."
,,Relaxation with views,4.0,,Nice views and easy to negotiate. Can easily see many of the city's buildings from here and it is clean and safe
,,TOO MANY EATING PLACES,5.0,,Quaint place with wide variety of eating places along the waterfront. A very happening place for all age groups some excellent food joints as per your taste.
,,Great place to hang around some food and drinks,4.0,,"Meeting friends, casual date, just by yourself- this is a great place with lots of options to et and drink and by the river."
,,Quite a bit tidier since its refit..,5.0,,"Boat quay underwent a complete renovation of the outside seating are last year to provide uniform seating areas for all restaurants. This has made the area much neater, but some of the character has been lost. Still a good range of restaurants and bars attracting a great many overseas visitors."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Came here for dinner with my husband one night during a three day stay in the city.

We had drinks at a lovely bar and then went to dinner at a fab Indian restaurant on the waterfront (the name escapes me but it was excellent!)

Beautiful views of the city at night, lovely to walk around looking at all the sights. An equal mix of tourists and locals with reasonable prices for food and drink."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Boat key plenty to see. A hive of activity. Great place for a meal or just a look round. Lets you see the old and new. Can get a little crowded try the boat ride on the rive. Plenty of photo opportunities. Try the penny black for a drink.
,,"Relaxing by the water, eating good food",5.0,,"Three of us visited Boat Quay and sat by the water, watching the boats travelling up and down the river. We had fajitas, plum chicken in lovely slightly overcast weather which was not too hot and with a slight breeze off the water it truly was a perfect day. Loved it and highly recommend to chill out."
,,Great views but do not let your visit be ruined by a surprise with your restaurant bill,4.0,,"There is no doubt that Boat Quay is a beautiful location by the river, with many restaurants on the bank of the river offering riverside seating and a great view of the river. Add to that the restored shophouses on the restaurant side of the river and you have the perfect picture for the tourist guides. And when you are there, you have at least 50 restaurants to choose from. So what could possibly go wrong? The answer is that the restaurant bill could be much much more than you were expecting. Most of the restaurants have the usual front of house staff urging you to stop and eat. Some are irritatingly aggressive, but no more so than other similar locations. The problem lies with the menus, because they often do not have prices, and when they do it is not necessarily helpful eg by showing a charge by weight. We sat down and ordered a straightforward meal for three. No starters - just a main course - and nothing expensive like crab or lobster. The menu seemed much the same as most of the other restaurants - all of the items were accompanied by a picture of the food. Something inside me told me to ask the price of the food that I had ordered. I was shocked when I was told that it would be S$216, plus 10% service charge plus GST. I said that was too much and that I would pay for my two cokes and a bottle of water and leave. The manager offered to reduce the price by 30%, but I still thought that excessive. I was charged S$18 for the drinks - one of the most expensive cokes that I have ever had! When you compare the price asked with the typical price that you would pay at one of the Hawkers (the name given to the restaurants found all over town), namely S$15 maximum per person, the Boat Quay prices are astonishing. Of course you expect to pay extra for the great view and atmosphere, but four times as much? My problem is not so much that the prices are excessive (they are in my opinion) but that they are not on open display. You do not necessarily know what you are going to pay and of course once you have eaten the food you have no option. My advice is that when you order, ask them to tell you how much the bill will be BEFORE they start to prepare the food, so that you can decide whether it is acceptable. And watch out for the 10% service charge and GST which probably will not be shown to at this stage but will add almost 20% to the price."
,,More pleasant than clarke quay,4.0,,There are many different small bars which are not as crowded as at the Clarke Quay. For a few chill drinks in the evening a good place.
,,amazing view during a cloudy day or an evening,5.0,,"I visited this place on a cloudy evening by a ferri. It was an amazing trip. If you're a tourist, you should not miss this boat ride."
,,Lovely and Historical,4.0,,"Great place to learn about the history of Singapore's colonial past and also to take many photographs as keepsakes. Lots of art and sculptures along the way for the art buff. I would skip the eateries on either side of the river because they are all rather pricey. Not a great place on rainy days. And do bring along an umbrella or cap for the sunny days. As I mentioned, loads of interesting historical things to look out for. Do not miss."
,,Lovely boat quay but not very exciting.,3.0,,"This is a place to get to from somewhere to somewhere. Good to pick up a boat trip to tour the Singapore River, but otherwise not worth going to on it's own."
,,Great venue for lunch,5.0,,Stopped here for lunch and was impressed. Great restaurants overlooking the water. You can even catch some otters if you are lucky.
,,Beautiful tour,5.0,,You must do this tour. It is about 40 minutes long. It costs S$25. I recommend you do it at night for two reasons: the view is beautiful with all the city lights on and because it is less hot. The boats have a narrator in English which explains every sights. A truly enjoyable experience. Highly recommend
,,StopOver,4.0,,Very chilled out and good food but expensive. Alcohol exceedingly expensive but service from the selection of restaurants is superb.
,,Relaxing time from sultry Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore is a quite sultry city, so if you don't want to always remain holed up in an aircon mall or hotel room, making a boat tour is a good alternative. The tour lasts around 40 minutes and you can see all main Singapore attractions (as historical buildings, Marina bay, the Lion statue, etc) by comfortably sitting on a wooden boat, while listening to the history od the city."
,,"Plenty to eat, drink and be merry",4.0,,"Plenty of restaurants, pubs and bars along the river to satisfy most anyone's taste. In particular there are a few very good Indian restaurants here. Sitting outside provides nice views of the river and city skyline. A visit to Singapore without visiting Boat Quay would not be complete."
,,Fantastic location and an amazing mix of restaurants and bars,4.0,,"We visited Boat Quay recently during our stay in Singapore and enjoyed lunch at pone of the many restaurants along the Singapore River. There is a great mix of bars and restaurants from varied nationalities, cultures and associated cuisines. Was an enjoyable time strolling through and then stopping to watch the world as it happens on the river."
,,An Evening to Remember!!!,4.0,,"Lovely gentle breeze & dazzling city lights by the side of river could delight your mind & soul. A must visit place for couples,friends & families.
Don't forget to taste the authentic chinese,Indian or continental dises from busy restaurants at Boat quay. One can take a boat ride too to explore the sorroundings over water!!!
If you are travelling alone then grab a beer & try to find your own at Boat quay!!!

Trust me, It's a mood changing place!"
,,Cool Place to visit,4.0,,"We started our exploration of Boat Quay from the riverbank at Fullerton Hotel walking in the direction of Clarke Quay, lots of restaurants and bars offering drink promotions on the waterfront and the adjoining side roads, plenty of live music on offer, not as busy as CQ but a cool place to visit."
,,Singapore Trip,5.0,,"Great place if you have nothing to do, small boats sailing around bay and river, short guides in English, love it so much, and romantic off course!"
,,Nice evening spot,4.0,,"Lots of bars and restaurants... Comfortable feel, lots of options... Pretty location...good photos to be had"
,,A wonderful Old and Historical part of Singapore,5.0,,If you have not been to Singapore the Boat Quay is a location situated in the Historical part of the city right on the Singapore River with the Financial district behind . Good restaurants along the Quayside although be aware that some target the Tourists! some used by the Bankers and Locals are good although a little overpriced. Good to visit and take photos and then find a better restaurant elsewhere
,,lovely,5.0,,We stayed near here so we went walking along the river every day a great way to spend your time. Lots of places to stop and eat or have drink
,,Look at part of the original Boat Quay,4.0,,"Cross the bridge to the Asian Museum, turn left and walk along the river to the next bridge. Just before the bridge, look across river and you see the shop fronts that were there in the 1800's before the recent high rise developments. The shops along this
quay are mostly restaurants serving excellent seafood and other dishes."
,,Nice,5.0,,Beautiful lagoon surrounded by Singapore tall buildings. You will also see old type of houses around.
,,Still a popular area of Singapore.,4.0,,"When we first visited Singapore 25 years ago Boat Quay was the most popular and crowded nightspot on the river as Clarke Quay was only in its infancy. Now it appears that Boat Quay's popularity has dwindled, as Clarke Quay a little further up the river has overtaken its neighbour in terms of visitor numbers and variety of bars and restaurants.
The restaurant staff trying to lure you into their establishments are far from threatening or persistent and everything seems good natured and friendly. Boat Quay seems to cater for a slightly older clientele than trendy Clarke Quay."
,,Place to soak up the atmosphere,5.0,,"Lots of pubs and restaurant. If you don't mind the price, this is the place to bring out of town guests.

I was here the morning of the Suprbowl and lots of pubs have big screen inside and outside even though it was 7.30 am.

I come here at least once a week in the morning, lots of joggers, people sitting around reading the morning newspaper and once a while there will be one or two taking a short nap before work.

It is connected to Fullerton Hotel, Cavenagh Bridge, Asian Civilization Museum and Elgin Bridge."
,,Quite expensive,3.0,,These restaurants were quite expensive and you get accosted by the touts offering all sorts of deals. Were after traditional chilli crab and didn't actually see any so skipped this.
,,Poor because of service,2.0,,We wanted to relax by nice glas of wine and beer. When we make a payment staff forgot about our change and could not understand English...
,,Touristy,2.0,,"The dock boasts nice views, but all the restaurants look too touristy, with touts etc and pricey for what they offer. Better eat elsewhere."
,,A must see,4.0,,Its a beautiful area and well worth visiting. There are many restaurants in the area and a very scenic walk around the Quay.
,,Awesome place to start the night,4.0,,a lot of restaurants and pubs. really cool if you have no idea what to do and you want a place to start your night from
,,Plenty of choice here,4.0,,Similar to Clarke Quay but laid out in one line along the river so seems a bit confronting with so many venues chasing you for business. Plenty of choice for food & bars but looked a little over priced for what was on offer. If you walk from Clarke to Marina Bay you'll pass through Boat Quay.
,,Restaurants and restaurants,3.0,,"We took the Singapore River tour and passed by Boat Quay. We walked back after the boat tour to see it up close. I was a little disappointed as it was mostly restaurants catering to tourists. Then again it's Singapore so maybe this should not be unexpected. But if you're looking to have a night out drinking and eating in restaurants that caters to tourists, this place may be right for you."
,,Too touristy,3.0,,"I felt that this place was too touristy for my liking. There were a number of restaurants located along the singapore river and they were not cheap by local standards. As a local, when I'm walking by, usually the servers will not call out or solicit business from me but I had seen them soliciting from tourist.

By still beautiful place to chill, especially after sunset."
,,Guaranteed good time and good food... !!!,5.0,,"Plenty of good options for restaurants all within a 2-block distance. Lots of different cuisines... A little bit on the pricey end, but they have lots of promotions and discounts so a little pre-planning will surely help you."
,,Another jewel on the river..,4.0,,"The second most famous Quay after the Clarke, this one too has a similar setting. Restaurants, pubs, night clubs, people selling curios, tattoo parlours.

It is a full on assault on your senses especially on the weekends. Rates are approx 30 to 40 percent steeper, and what you are paying for is the location and experience rather than food."
,,Expensive and touristy,3.0,,Nice for a walk to take in the sights. There are lots of restaurants and bars to cater to the young crowd and tourists. I personally find this place expensive and touristy.
,,Enjoy Night,5.0,,Best place to spend time with Friends and have good food. You will find different Cuisine Restaurants and outlets. Spending quality time.....the best place in Singapore
,,"Great Seafood, Great City Sights",4.0,,"Walking along Boat Quay is full of surprises to your senses.

Water side restaurants that specialise in Seafood, Crab a speciality & Chill Crab is a must.

Ideal for either a lunch or Dinner. Local bars are also around as are some late night clubs only a street back from the water."
,,Clark Quay is better,3.0,,"In my humble opinion, you're have a nicer time at Clark Quay than Boat Quay - that's assuming you're over 40"
,,relaxing place,3.0,,I liked it because: it is good relaxing place cool cafes and restaurants around around the area close to city center
,,Relaxing place by the river,4.0,,"Nice pace to relax and grad a drink or good. Expensive to eat and drink but overall a nice piece of the river connected to other ""keys"". We walked along the entire river ...from the flyer. Very nice but very very long walk....."
,,I will always book a Hotel around this place,5.0,,"I Simply love Boat Quay and nearby Clarke Quay for its lively night life. When you at not sure where to go. Just head here on any evening and you would not be disappointed. I always prefer to book a hotel near this place because it gives you so many options to eat out. Live bands, scores of eating places, music and above all a lovely river flowing by the side."
,,"Nice Walk, Plenty of Restaurants and Bars",4.0,,"We visited in a Friday afternoon, walked along soaking up the local cultures. We sat at a bar for a few beers and some food. A continual steam of boats and people, you will never be bored of looking. The little turtles in the water make for a little excitement. Worth a visit."
,,Great Place to Unwind After a Hard Day,4.0,,"The Boat Quay (pronounced as ""key"") is a great place to unwind after a long day in the business district of Singapore.

People of all hues mostly young crowd can be seen moving around and sitting outside the eating and drinking joints in the area. Most of the establishments offer ""Happy Hour"" to their customers before 8 PM as the place gets crowded after that in any case. You have a choice of a wide range of cuisine to pick from and let me assure you, you will not return unsatisfied from this place.

I have read some people rue the lack of variation in the place, well I can only sympathise with them for, if it is so good now, how much better it would have been earlier.

My Verdict: A great place to spend an evening."
,,Unattractive. Catering for visitors mainly.,3.0,,"This is either you thing or it's not. We found it quite unattractive and full of tourists with nothing Singaporean about it. So many better places to go than this. Just worth a walk through, that's about it."
,,Disastrous and Unimaginative Revamp,1.0,,"What on earth have the government of Singapore done to Boat Quay? This was once a very nice place to sit beside the river and have a drink and/or a meal. A great setting with decorative awnings which differed from outlet to outlet. Now, in an apparent attempt to upgrade and probably modernize the place, Boat Quay has become typical of what we see happening in the rest of Singapore. The character has been completely lost with the use heavy, black, uniform steel girders stretching the whole length of the quay side which has absolutely no character whatsoever. There is very little protection to diners when it rains if sitting close to the edge of the quay. Don't the government realize what a gem they have, or did have in Boat Quay? I have been coming here for over twenty years and was looking forward to seeing the change; but can't say how disappointed I was. It seems like the whole refurbishment has been done ""on the cheap"" with absolutely no creativity or imagination. The whole length of boat quay has been replaced by a standard width (to save cost I would guess) of heavy metal awnings which means where the wider part of the quayside exists, there is considerable lost space. This will inevitably mean that now some restaurateurs will lose money because they can no longer fit in as many tables.

Added to the sterile look of the place is the ridiculous decision to increase the rents of all the businesses which operate there, This cost, no doubt, will have to be passed on to the customers, thereby making an already expensive place to socialize even more expensive. And no doubt also, you will see more and more establishment close and re-open than before. Another money making scheme by the establishment? I think so."
,,Great area to have dinner,5.0,,Clarke Quay is an area with restaurants and bars where you can have dinner on the bay. All types of cuisines at one place. Many restaurants offer a happy hour before 8 pm and it gets crowded after that time.
,,Disappointing change.,2.0,,"I have been visiting Boat Quay every couple of months for the last 10 years. It was always a lovely place to sit for a drink or a meal at one of the many ""different"" outside areas of the bars/restaurants. Since my last visit in July the outside area has been ""modernised"" with every unit similar to the next. What used to be a lovely mix of different ethnicities is now one big bland steel structure.
I don't think that I am alone in thinking this as a lot of the regular drinkers have disappeared along with a great many tourists."
,,exciting place to be,5.0,,"Road Quay is exciting and is amongst bar, restaurant, shop and trendy small bars, you will find night club also disembark or embark on the canal back to the bay.
Lots of colours and a fun little boat trip.
the bars do have all something different and are all fun but on the weekend it is very busy."
,,Cool area,4.0,,Lots of good bars and restaurants well worth a look when in Singapore. Popular with tourists and locals alike.
,,Best hotels and relaxing dinner on the bay,5.0,,"Best hotels and relaxing dinner on the bay. Lot of sea food restaurants, bit pricey but worth the ambiance and location. best to hang out drink and have dinner with friends."
,,Evening casual dinner venue,5.0,,"Riverside dining, various restaurants, tables by the riverside , views of lit buildings, wonderful atmosphere."
,,Good Atmosphere,4.0,,"We stayed further up at Clarkes Quay but walked down through here every evening, personally we felt it had a better atmosphere than Clarkes, still busy with lots of restaurants and bars but much less busy and more relaxed. Next time we visit we would definitely spend more time down here, much better atmosphere."
,,a bit pricey food and drinks,3.0,,"Food and drinks here are a bit pricey, but hey, it is the tourist belt afterall. The food is fancy, service is abundant and you're paying for all this. Nice to chill on a table by the water on a cool night."
,,Place to Enjoy the Atmosphere and for Food,3.0,,"This section along the Singapore River is busy with restaurants and eateries that start springing to life towards the evening and night. Otherwise, it's a place for enjoying the atmosphere by the river and also for photos."
,,Very Good Boat Trip,4.0,,"This boat trip will cost you S$25 per person / trip, I think for around 45 minutes.
Best done in the night when all the lights of MBS, Downtown and Clarke Quay lit the night. There is a small TV inside the boat explains the area.
But for me the best place to sit is at the back of the boat (if not raining), with the unlimited view of the city."
,,NIGHT VIEWS,4.0,,Go here at night for the views It is a vibrant area with many bars and restaurants Maybe take a river cruise
,,Nice view and nice dinner.,5.0,,"Even is not the better place to eat. The view is amazing to have drinks and dinner. Is not a cheap place, so ask for the prices after u get into a restaurant. They close so late."
,,"Passed through, nice vibe",4.0,,"Spent a short while here early evening. With more one we would certainly have come back. It seemed a great place, not shiny and glossy but a little more real somehow. I would guess that you would come here if you lived in Singapore."
,,Great to People Watch,4.0,,You can find Everything around the Bay Good High End Food to Local fine Seafood Fun and Interesting Bars Nice to take the Water Taxi to Marina Bay.
,,Enjoyable!,3.0,,We first visited it while we were on the way from Raffles Place MRT to Merlion Park. The river itself was a bit boring but came lively at night with a lot of restaurants surrounded.
,,Night views at Boat Quay,3.0,,"This is one of my favourite places to sit at night.
The view is awesome.
You can sit at one of the many bars along the Quay and just look at the fantastic view sitting by the Singapore River.
Here you can see the fantastic Fullerton Hotel , the Singapore Wheel and Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
Its a great place to meet friends to people watch and just sit and gasp and the amazing view.
The prices here are a bit on the high side for food and drink...but you are paying for the location and the view.
Despite the prices of food and drink here it is often busy on a Friday and Saturday evening.
It has a great buzz and of course let's not forget that fabulous view.
A must see."
,,Enjoyable Dining by the River,3.0,,"Interesting mix of restaurants ,cafes and bars by the river and linked to Financial District and Fullerton Hotel . Good seafood restaurants but Clarke Quay has more variety of food and bars"
,,Downtown Singapore,4.0,,This is the best area to have a couple of drinks and chill out. Street full of bars and pubs on one side and beautiful riverside view on the other. There are a few bars with good Live music as well. Definitely recommend going here at least once during your stay.
,,Food Food Every where,4.0,,There are plenty of F&B outlets there but they tend to be close after 10:30pm. There is a 24 hours Mac Donald's outlet there.
,,Boat Quay is changing!,4.0,,All the old terraces are being replaced with some modern structure! Definitely a shame and cannot understand the reason for it. The older setup had so much more character. Another city planner that has managed to destroy the charm.
,,Lively and Entertaining,4.0,,Very lively place in the heart of singapore. Easily accessible for all kinds of people as the bistros and pubs are offering varied cuisines. We went there twice in our seven day stay.
,,Cosmopolitan,4.0,,A beautiful view of the river in the busiest part of Singapore. Place is crowded with multi-cuisine restaurants and pubs. One can really spend time enjoying the view/drinking/enjoying gastronomic delights.
,,Great place to get your drink!,5.0,,"Expensive place but its worth the price to be in the thick of things! Great bands, the couple of places I went to the DJ's were pretty average, but the bands were tight!"
,,Excellent setting,4.0,,Boat key is on the Singapore River and is a hive of activity with many bars and restaurants as well as river boat trips. It is very popular and very busy. As a result most bars and restaurants charge a premium for the location.
,,Fun,5.0,,"Music, food and good company. This area is lined with food areas that mix so many cultures you can pretend you are in any part of the world"
,,"Good River View, Nice Bistros, Pubs and Food",4.0,,"This one is one of the best places in Singapore for party, leisure, outing or just hanging out whatever you like. If you are family man take nice river view, if you are party animal try pubs bistro etc. Many restaurants nearby, all international varieties including Italian, Indian, vegetarian, Seafood and much more"
,,Good Place for Enjoying Vintage Singapore Night Life,5.0,,"If you come Singapore never forget to visit this neighbourhood; Boat Quay Riverside. This area, in my opinion, was the great place to spend time at the evening. Here, you can walking around, eating, drinking, or just sitting and enjoying the atmosphere. Have sit at the outdoor of a bar, order a glass of cold beer, and enjoy the situation. You can also found a nice variety of restaurants, Chinese, American/British bars, Indian, etc. I recommended you to stay for a nite or even more at the hostels around this place. They have a good price and good place. Clean and cheap, for this area (because you can found the cheaper one at Bugis or Little India). But the price is worth for all places as you can catch at Singapore. Take a walk you can found Asian Civilisations Museum and other historical buildings, esplanade, and the Merlion."
,,Boat Quay,4.0,,"Take metro to Raffles Place station to go to Boat Quay. Part of the promenade is dotted with bars and restaurants with terrific view of the Asian Civilisations Museum and other historical buildings on the opposite side of the river, both day and night."
,,"great place for eating, drinking and relaxing",4.0,,"I love this place. eating, drinking, walking or just sitting and enjoying the view, any one (or all!) of them are them are a great way to spend an evening.

there's a nice variety of restaurants, fresh seafood, Chinese, American/British ex-pat bars, Indian, etc.

Sometimes the restaurant workers are a little aggressive about trying to invite you in, but it's not too bad. seems like most of them have outdoor dining. I've eaten at a few and would love to try others on my next trip. I usually stay within walking distance so this is a go-to spot for me"
,,Quieter less dynamic version of Clarke Quay,3.0,,Boat Quay is nice especially at night but really is a poor relation of Clarke Quay. If you don't want the louder noise etc of Clarke this is a good spot.
,,I never go to Singapore with a visit to Boat Quay,5.0,,Great deals here at restaurant and bars. Where else in Singapore can you buy a Jug of beer for S$9++ Many choices of different meal types and most is good food. That having been said be careful these places are for tourists so the food IS EXPENSIVE and the beer pricing the draw
,,Nice Evening beer places,5.0,,This is a splendid place for a beer after a hard day's work. You can find many good restaurants and bars along the side of Singapore river. You can also find good spots for photos to keep your memories of this place now that you had visited this spot.
,,expensive food,3.0,,be carefuk in ordering food. a lot is charged per 100 grams. if you hve budget to eat beside a river then go. you can also just walk and enjoy the view
,,full of life,5.0,,"This location is very close to the business district and there are a lot of restaurants, bars, and gentlemen clubs in this area. Tons of outdoor sitting. Street is filled with people, and music. Great variety of restaurants to choose from. It is a must see location."
,,good in evening,5.0,,a must do thing in singapore. try to take the ride around sun set. this gives you an unique experience of looking at the surrounding buildings with light on. don't forget to take pictures.
,,a tourist site,3.0,,a tourist walking site with shops/restaurantas...and that's it...not much else to review. and...scene.
,,a must on a Friday night...,5.0,,Try this place on a Friday night (NO KIDS - just you and your partner) and you will have a night to remember and take back to your grave.The choice of parties and pubs and restaurants are simple amazing. You have to be there to soak in the spirit.
,,multi-cultural town!,5.0,,"This place if full of colorful buildings and GOURMETS!!! the Chili crab from Jumbo is a must try food there, and you will enjoy the Singapore style street foods in this area as well!"
,,Great place to see and chill out,4.0,,"Restaurants line both sides of the quay, which are reached by a bridge and /or underpass. Be careful when selecting where you eat. We ended up in a fairly robust, laid back seafood outdoor place and spent £130 on crab, prawns and two beers, I found the menu slightly misleading. Food was good, but not that good."
,,Very nice clean good food!,3.0,,"Like this area very very much, good sightseeing, bars and restaurants.... You can see old style Singapore as well the new skyscraper..."
,,Multi cultural food,4.0,,"Plenty of choice here, whether you want Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malay it's all here. Situated across the bridge from Clarke quay you cannot go wrong as the choice is so vast. Only down side as with all of Singapore, it's not cheap....."
,,"Hundreds of expansive restaurants, nice for a stroll at night",4.0,,"Boat Quay used to be Singapore most vibrant shophouses area in the Singapore Port, until the Government decided to ""clean"" it. It now hosts hundreds of very expansive restaurants, catering mainly to tourists, sometimes with poor service. It makes up for a nice walk and people watching at night."
,,Nice place for chilling,4.0,,"Currently being under renovation on the river side, the place is still really a nice place to chill out after work. There are lot of bars and restaurant, it may not be the best food around but still not bad."
,,Great dining area,5.0,,"So many places to choose from. The aromas from the curries in the Indian Section were amazing. Reasonably priced meals. Situated across the bridge from Clark Quay, it's a lot quieter but still with lots of atmosphere"
,,Fun night out!,4.0,,"Experience a mix of locals and tourists drinking and dining along the river. For bars, check out Penny Black or BQ Bar, and be careful to avoid the tourist trap eateries which are typically poor quality and expensive. Basically, research well if you plan to eat on this stretch. *UPDATE* lost a bit of soul while the out door tables and chairs have been removed for long-term maintenance - possibly try Robertson Quay in the meantime (Clarke Quay also an option by very touristy and expensive and more bars than eateries)"
,,Less busy than Clarke Quay,5.0,,Found the eating and drinking places comparable to Clarke Quay without the crowds. Recommend and has its own river cruise jetty. not far from Clarke Quay
,,"Go with family , friends....",4.0,,We were surprised to see the place..lot of drinking places and lo to eat..U just wanna walk and walk..explore everything..until you settled for one thing..eating by the river and having some good drinks is always pleasant..lot of bars..eating joints..ice cream..people buy beers from 7/11 and sits on the bridge..
,,Starting Re-development,3.0,,"This once thriving attraction is currently under-re-development which will affect all bars and restaurants along the quay side, its a shame really as this in my opinion was the best Quay in Singapore, it will now end up like both Clarke and Robinson quays with no character or soul with the prices reflecting the new image."
,,its an great place for some good food and good times,4.0,,clark quay's younger cousin I would say...but same buzz..great food..awaesome joints..nive place to hang out for drinks..cool eve. breeze...really enjoy the dine outs here..
,,always improving,5.0,,pleasantly surprised with changes here and new eating places e.g. Gong. I regret not venturing over here earlier during my recent Singapore visit
,,Visit often over a weekend,4.0,,Excellent atmosphere. Excellent crowds. Excellent beer. Festive. Go there with friends when we just want to relax
,,Nice Area and Very Nice Walk,4.0,,"Boat Quay is located at Singapore River on the opposite side of Clarke Quay. This place is very popular to tourists. It is very nice to walk along the Boat Quay, nice view many cafes, restaurants and shops."
,,Old vs. new,3.0,,"You can not get a far more contradiction between Boat Quay and the busy business centre behind it.. it is old, charming and historic set by the riverside whilst having dozens of skyscrapers behind it. The place houses an endless row of restaurants to tantalize everyone’s taste buds but be careful as some are tourist traps and charge an arm and a leg."
,,Enjoy a walk along the river bank,4.0,,"Boat Quay is on the opposite side of the Singapore River to Clarke Quay.

The buildings are more modern on this side - very popular with tourists and locals to observe all activities on both Clarke Quay and Boat Quay.

Boats take tourists for rides along the river with the boats lighting up at night.

On the boardwalk you can buy lovelocks to attach to wire fencing and a love arch.
There was also a bride and groom taking photos nearby.

Would recommend a walk around both sides of the Singapore River - it's a nice place."
,,heal your hectic day,5.0,,"sit down under the trees, plug in your headphones, close your eyes for a while, inhale exhale, open your eyes and look around, look the boat, look the restaurant, look the night scenery, and i bet you'd be greatfull with you day. there's no hectic day as soon as you go to boat quay. nice place to heal your day."
,,Beautiful river,5.0,,All shop houses now turn to cafe along the river make the scenery is very beautiful. Walk here from Clarke Quay to Fullerton Hotel.
,,Less wilder side of Clark Quay,3.0,,It is the less wilder side of Clark Quay. Good place to go if you are looking for a good meal by the river. or when you do not find a place in Clark Quay.
,,Well worth visiting,4.0,,Taking a river cruise adds to ones holiday and gives an insight in the history of Singapore. A very enjoyable ecperience.
,,Tourist trap - not worth visiting,2.0,,"All this contains are overpriced restaurants and bars which are not very good. Anything that can be found here can be found better and cheaper elsewhere. Also it's hard to find a taxi from here. The view of Boat Quay from outside is OK, and if you look carefully you can see a huge black statue of a bird (near to Raffles Place side, by the river). The rear end of this bird is allegedly positioned as an insult from one bank to another. That's quite funny but not worth visiting for."
,,"Expat staple, can be expensive, depends what you're looking for. Worth a visit!",3.0,,"Whether you will enjoy Boat Quay entirely depends on whether or not you want to be surrounded by expats. It is full of expats almost all of the time but if that's what you're looking for then head down! Plenty of bars etc, around $10-12++ for a drink at most places.
Worth a visit if that's what you're into but please explore more of Singapore!"
,,Tourists trap,2.0,,"Nice to walk around, except from the lunch/dinner time where there is an army of waiters trying to attract customers to overly expensive factory-restaurant... Better to walk from the other side, quieter, better view"
,,Beautiful Walk. Annoying Restaurants.,3.0,,"I love taking the walk from Clark Quay to Merlion Park. Along the way, Boat Quay is a nice area for a view of the river. I do recommend it. I knocked off 2 stars because of how annoying the restaurants are. It's annoying to be heckled to eat at their place when I don't even look at them or their restaurant. But other than that, it's a nice area to take a stroll through."
,,Dinner in this location is the best,5.0,,We went to the place in the night and many restaurant around there and people waiting so we went to the 2nd floor and have dinner there.
,,Old Singapore in the heart of the city's financial district,4.0,,A delightful insight into old Singapore in the heart of the city's financial district. During the evening this is a colourful and vibrant place to have a drink by the river at considerably cheaper prices than the hotels
,,Boat Quay,4.0,,"There are two quays to check out in Singapore - Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. Both of them are well worth a visit but just a word of caution. The prices are generally tourist prices by with the conversion rate, it is not too bad. Lots of food and drinking for the Singapore experiences"
,,Older shops and restaurants with a nice view,4.0,,"Walking along Boat Quay is always worthwhile just for the experience against the waterfront. Indian and Chinese food restaurants with seating on the water are littered about, along with a few bars and shops. Walking down from Clark Quay is about a 10 minute stroll."
,,Excellent night entertainment,5.0,,"Walk along the busy streets, enjoy the magical atmosphere, many pubs playing soft music, peek at the crab restaurants or eat any other place.. The view is excellent and you can sit almost on the riverside."
,,The place to be at,4.0,,"I always love going to Boat Quay. You can pickup drinks, lot of food options, view near the waterbody is simply amazing. Must go."
,,Evening entertainment,4.0,,"In the evening it is nice to walk along Boat Qaue and stop for a beer in a pub. It is magical to sit at the dock and see all the beautiful buildings in the evening light, and all the beautiful people who passed by.
There are also a lot of nice restaurant along the quay."
,,Riverside dining,3.0,,"The good bits are the heritage buildings on both sides of the river amidst skyscrapers of downtown Singapore.

There are a few Salvador Dali statues at UOB Plaza.

The food offerings are at best mediocre.

Take a walk. Enjoy the sights. Smile at the touts. But don't eat here."
,,Just Love Singapore - so much to see.,5.0,,"We walked the whole of the Quay then returned to Boat Quay to take a ride on one of their ""Bum Boats"". Their condition was immaculate which was really surprising. Very enjoyable trip up and down the river giving a great view of Singapore on both sides. Some of the architecture is amazing. The Quays are quite amazingl with their buildings painted in masses of colours. Unfortunately not much is open til the evening but if you walk from Boat Quay up to the very end there is a large restaurant open all day where we stopped for a cool drink."
,,Average,3.0,,"Went for lunch, loads of restaurants but mostly designed for evening so many were shut as were bars etc, Not designed for lunch really so go back in evening when its buzzing ..."
,,A Friday Evening Walkabout,4.0,,"Our main aim was to visit Clarke Quay this evening but we took a detour and headed to Boat Quay first.

A pleasant walk along the Singapore River watching diners having an evening out while River boats plied the river with their passengers.

Took the opportunity to get some good pictures of the city skyline, as also The National Parliament and The Supreme Court before we moved to Clarke Quay."
,,good budget food by the river,4.0,,"boat quay is located adjacent to the high end clarke quay. since we were not in the mood for fine dining, we went to boat quay instead. there are many restaurants here serving asian (even indian), lebanese, etc. there are some restaurants that serve sheesha too. it is located right by the river, so you can choose to sit in the open facing the river or in the restaurants. we preferred siting out. although it was a little hot, there were fans to keep you amply ventilated. i dont now recolllect the restaurant we went to, but we ordered a plate of wedges, pasta and it was very very good"
,,long strip of bars and restaurants buzzing at happy hour,4.0,,Visited the waterfront and called in at the Boat Quay which a busy strip of bars and eateries Lots of locals and expats there and happy hour offers everywhere
,,Dining by the river,4.0,,"My boyfriend and I decided to have our dinner at Boat Quay. Initially, we wanted to have some turkish food at Cedar Grill but it was non-existent! Feeling dejected, we finally settled down at Bq Bar, also selling turkish food. The view of the cityline by the river was awesome and the weather was windy. Food at Bq Bar was so so and the waiters were very forgetful. She served our mains and told us that she will bring our cutlery later. Instead I saw her wiping the tables at other corners while we were patiently waiting for our cutlery. The waiter who came to take our order did not take down what we wanted and he missed out one dish. Also, he took very long to serve our ice water too. At that point, there were only a few tables of customers. Overall, we were quite disappointed with the service."
,,Look for cheap drinks deals with your meal,4.0,,"There are plenty of restaurant options for dinner (not open for lunch) if you like Chinese and Indian food, and many offer ""Happy Hour"" deals on beer (by the jug and mug) and wine, a good thing since drinks in Singapore are very expensive. You'll see the Marina Bay Sands hotel peeking at you on the right and the river boats chugging along past as you dine al fresco. One Raffles Square (Altitude Bar) is just across the road for a nightcap with a view when you've finished your meal!"
,,Where the nightlife is,4.0,,"It's proximity to the business district means that there will always be quite a decent crowd of people on any given day (except maybe for Mondays).

Quite a lot of tourists here, but do look out for the unscrupulous restaurants that try to charge exorbitant prices, especially for the seafood. Make sure you ask about the price before ordering!"
,,Good place to eat,4.0,,Visited Boat Quay at night to eat out at one of the eataries. Lots and Lots of options available. Dine along the river side to get the best views of Singapore Skyline. Worth a visit
,,Singapore's Pub,4.0,,"Restaurants of all shapes, size and cuisine in restored heritage buildings. I would say that the better, more unique restaurants are hidden between the more opulent ones catering to tourists. At Boat Quay, it pays to go off the beaten track."
,,Great for som Local Seafood,4.0,,The River Front is a lovely location to walk though and enjoy a drink or seafood meal. It is easy to reach and located via the New Bridge which is next to the Parliament Building. This is a wonderful location to see Singapore traditional buildings with the back drop of Modern Sky Scrapers. There is seafood and general Asian food for every taste and you can easily find something to suit your budget. After some time relaxing watching the world go by you can take a nice walk along the River Bank.
,,Fun!,5.0,,"My husband and I decided to eat dinner at Boat Quay one evening while on vacation. It was a great choice! We found a little pub and got seats right next to the water. The food was great and the atmosphere amazing. The Quay comes alive at night and is a wonderful place to sit and have a drink, meet new people, and enjoy the night!"
,,Boat Ride is nice,4.0,,"You have some restaurants and bars on the side, it gets busy by evening. There is an adventure spot there. One thing is that the river is kept quite clean and tidy. Its something that we should also learn and try to keep our water bodies in the same way."
,,nice,5.0,,Nice touring and can see much on singapore... can you imagine the water is clean and no trash.. i have been to so many place and singapore river can be consider clean...
,,Visit for a romantic evening,4.0,,In my opinion I would say skip Clarke quay and head straight to Boat quay! This place comes alive at night when all the little restaurants lining the river switch their lights on. Every restaurant has it's own quirkiness and character so there's something for everyone.
,,Regenerated,4.0,,"Great regenerated area. Full restaurants and coffee shops, bars and music venues.sitting outside with beer a recommendation."
,,well its a walk on the river,5.0,,people who loves landscaping and admiration will surely come to boat quay where people can embark on boats and enjoy the landscape and the setting sun
,,great restaurants - don't miss Boat Quay,5.0,,Many poeple only make it as far as Clarke Quay but it is worth a further walk along the river to get to Boat Quay. There are many restaurants and it is very lovely dining and looking over the river
,,Nice Place,4.0,,"This place is calm during other time and rocking on Friday and Saturday nights. We stayed here in Met a Space Pod and enjoyed the area for 5 complete days. Easily accessible to attractions, I would love to recommend and stay here in this area."
,,Night life,5.0,,If you are in Singapore with your wife or girlfriend Clark quay /boat quay is one of the most romantic place to be in I would suggest that one should atleast vist it once . The river side view with diffrent cusines option and bars this Is a must watch and if you are party animal then you are in right place . Thumbs up for party
,,Place to have a few drinks and eat,4.0,,"This area is full of restaurants and bars. Plenty of choice, but be warned, drinks are very expensive in Singapore. Try to find bar offering happy hour. But you'll still end up paying 5£ for pint o lager."
,,Alive at night,5.0,,Boat quay comes alive at night. Really busy. Plenty of eating and drinking places . Or catch river taxi for a boat trip . Listen to the buskers Well worth a visit
,,Nice view but pushy restaurant hosts,3.0,,"The waterfront restaurants have a great view but every other step, a restaurant host will be pushing a menu at you trying to tempt you into their spot. We really like the indian food that we had there and it was a nice walk from there to the Merlion park."
,,Over-rated,3.0,,We decided to eat here in the evening but you get bombarded by offers from all the riverside restaurants. We decided to eat at one of the Chinese ones and it was expensive and not that special apart from the setting which is what you are paying for.
,,"Drinks with a view, but can be expensive",4.0,,"River walk with numerous bars and restaurants, with river and skyline views. Walk along the Boat quay from the waterfront to Clarke Quay, stopping any one of the bars to take a break from the hot Singapore nights, Boat Quay is popular with tourists and locals. Some of the bars can seem expensive, if your not used to Singapore prices."
,,Atmosphere plus!,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a lovely spot if you are looking for a place to eat in Singapore. There is a huge variety of restaurants and cuisines to choose from. We had a lovely meal in an Indian Restaurant called Ras which was located right on the waters edge. We sat outside and had an excellent meal.
Boat Quay is highly recommended."
,,Nice and busy place in Singapore with plenty of restaurant,3.0,,This is where you need to go out at night to enjoy diner and a small breeze along the river. Near the Marina and connecting to Clark Quay where restaurant are of higher quality.
,,Great Night life and food,5.0,,"This is the best place to visit in the evening for a few drinks and good food. The place is filled with pubs and restaurants next to the river , there are a few good sea food restaurants here . The crowd here is young and hip. This place opens till early morning."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Boat Quay used to be the place to go for dinner overlooking the water and with a wide variety of reasonably priced food, good beer and a great atmosphere. However, having not been there since around 2008, we were sadly disappointed by the changes to a crowded, almost seedy bar atmosphere, disappointing expensive food and staff lacking in knowledge and with little interest in service. This is what happened to Newton Circus, so we were surprised to see it being repeated at Boat Quay."
,,expensive but the views are great,3.0,,Many of the restaurants here are intent on ripping off tourists so check your bill and choose carefully. there are lots of options and some are very good food. None are cheap - pick a place near the river and make sure you don't pay for things you don't use like nuts and paper towel.
,,Ride for oldies,2.0,,"It is a very dull and simple boat ride across the Singapore river, takes you the happening Clarke Quay place, but the ride has nothing fancy."
,,great street,5.0,,"This is a great spot by the water, so many of places to eat at. it great vibe at night - a defenite must visit."
,,View,4.0,,This water front is pretty good for day or night.A good place to go for a walk.There are a very good variety of food outlets to choose from.
,,"Plenty of bars and restaurants, but over priced",3.0,,"All of the bars and restaurants along the river front are way overpriced, and often not that good in regard to food quality. You are far better off, going back one street to Circular Road where there is just as many bars and restaurants to choose from, and the prices are far more reasonable."
,,Retained historical hub for rubber & spice trades amongst the new concrete jungle,4.0,,"Most big cities need a river for trades with other countries, this was THE place. Spot the old ""godowns"" where spices & rubber were shipped in & stored, carried by the ""coolies"" --manual labourers in the good old days. Reminds me of those narrow houses in Amsterdam with hoist ."
,,Great veiws.,4.0,,"Transformed from a working river .Having known this place from the early sixties,the changes have be brilliant.Well worth visiting both day and night."
,,Great Lunch on the Water,4.0,,We stopped here for lunch and picked India House. Probably hopping at night but nice on a hot summer day with the overhead fans and ice cold beer
,,Good place to eat,3.0,,"A pleasant walk along the river. Boat Quay is a good place to stop for food if you are in-between one site to another . Literally hundreds of restaurants for all pockets. Other than that, buildings are the backdrop with the river in the middle. Not an exciting place in itself, just good for food."
,,Tourist trap,3.0,,"Food and drinks are at tourist prices along Boat quay look at the boards out he front of the restaurants for your choice, saying is right on the river wall which gives you a very nice setting. There is a usual free beer offer if you eat here but beware watered I have received watered down beer on Occassion. The choice of food is great though every Chinese style you can ask for I think. Get off at Raffels place or Clarke quay the Ali along the river front to Boat Quay (5 minutes at best)"
,,Stunning at night,5.0,,We did a bumboat tour at night and it was stunning. Great views and can see for miles. Very active place at night.

,,A great place to eat,4.0,,Wander along here and Clarke Quay in the evening and you will certainly find something that you fancy to eat. The range takes in the whole world and the standards are high. Obviously local foods lead the way along with Indian and Malaysian dishes but on the occasion of my last visit I also had excellent tapas - the world along one street!
,,"Great food & great view, but priced for tourists",4.0,,"Boat Quay is certainly an amazing place to go to get some great food. Be prepared for wait staff to try and entice you into their restaurants as you walk past. The food is good, but very expensive.

My recommendation; if you're only in Singapore for a few days;come here and try the Chilli Crab. If you want to avoid the tourist spots and explore the local scene - skip it."
,,Walk through but don't stop,3.0,,An interesting string of bars and restaurants which because of their iconic location probably charge the earth to eat and drink and I suspect the quality is patchy.We had drinks their and at £7.50 for a pint of San Miguel didn't stay for a second!!Worth a quick stroll through but nothing special.
,,A happy place.,5.0,,"Lined with bars & restaurants along the Singapore river, boat quay is bustling with life all through the night, especially on the weekend. You will find enthusiastic sports fans as well as those who just want to have a fun night out along the streets. Lovely atmosphere and happy people everywhere."
,,interesting,5.0,,"once again this area was fascinating, spectacular and very easy to reach. There are many restaurants, museums and many places to take a casual stroll during the day or, even prettier, at night. People and places are limitless. A major advantage is to stay near the river which gives access to Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, Chinatown and Marina Bay - all within walking distance. Not to mention easy access to thr Raffles area and so much more!"
,,Amazing Nightlife at Clarke Quay and Boat Quay - Singapore Holidays,5.0,,"Amazing Nightlife at Clarke Quay and Boat Quay - Singapore Holidays. Great sea food restaurants, river cruise, nice views and lots of tourists. The shimmering colourful lights just add to the ambience of the place, throbbing with people and music."

,,Nice scenic area to stroll,4.0,,"Popular place for tourists to visit- bustling bars & tempting restaurants located by the riverside. Beware of some restaurants - its not the area to go for a decent indian food. Dont be fooled by the 20% discount offered on tourist rates as owners try to tempt you to dine at their restaurants, its nice to sit by the waterfront and enjoy the breeze, but the food quality of this particular indian restaurant was disappointing - just didnt taste fresh and not presentable."
,,Lovely place to walk at night,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a lovely place to walk and dine at night, a little breeze gives you a little bit off a cool down from a hot day"

,,Place for tourist,3.0,,"It definetly a place for tourist, not too much for local to visit, alot of pub and restuarant during night time. Price of eatery is more expensive than other places in singapore."
,,Very Crowded,3.0,,Adjacent to Clarke Quay - the original landing ground of the first travellers to Singapore - it is a hive of eateries and busy at night. This is the centre of Singaporean night life. Good views of the city and surrounding areas - be sure to visit the statue of Raffles - thankfully he had been cleaned up since we were last in Singapore 2 years ago.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Calm waters and full of sights, a haven away from the hustle and bustle. We got a total new impression of the city from the waterway."
,,Tourist trap,2.0,,"walk through this place on your way to better places for food and drink (that is the majority of Sg). If you do want to eat beside a quay - walk on a bit to Robertson's, you have been warned."
,,Way too touristy ... a lot of foreign franchises seem to be here as well ...,2.0,,Way too touristy ... a lot of foreign franchises seem to be here as well ... Stopped quickly during a boat tour but there were just too many tourist traps to justify staying long.

,,Short Stop,3.0,,"We had been here years ago for a meal with family and we were curious. It was afternoon when we were there and not many eating places open. It is mainly a hive of activity in the evening for drinking/eating. Some re-development being done, but not on our list for a revisit."
,,Great outing for dinner and an evening walk,5.0,,"Just behind Raffles place MRT, you can get a host of restaurants to try for from beer bars to Italian, Indian, Chinese, Thai or Mexican. Try having a dinner in one of the restaurants with dinner table besides the Singapore river."
,,Quaint with loads of eateries,4.0,,Located where the river opens up into a bay. Very busy & bustling. Loads of places to eat but also good to stop off for a drink and sit riverside watching the boats and people go past.
,,"Perfect place to have dinner (bars, fine restaurants, gourmet cuisine)",5.0,,"In Clarke Quay there's a range of food and drink with different places for most tastes.
Long list of Bars and Restaurants of all types right at the river bank., most of them offer fresco dining which is really nice ...!!!!!
lot of terrace options which is ideal for drink and dine.

Place is great after sunset onwards, the whole place comes to life without giving you the sense of being overcrowded or lost amongst them..

You can see the Marina Bay Sands Laser show from this place...

Happening place at night in Singapore and one should not miss...."

It is especially nice from sunset onwards, as at this time the whole place comes to life, without giving you the sense of being overcrowded."
,,Great variety and good crowd,4.0,,"Can try about 100 different beers in one small stretch of bars. Great camraderie, nice atmosphere and smiling faces."
,,Birthday drinks and dinner,5.0,,"Went to Clifford Quay for my 50th, so had to do Boat Quay for my sisters 50th. Probably chose the wrong bar as had limited selection of beers, and no Tiger shame on you. Food excellent and great value"
,,BOAT QUAY NIGHT LIFE,5.0,,Boat Quay is a mixture of old and new. More and more places are being renovated some completely. There are dozens of places to eat and drink and there are a lot of night clubs.
,,Nightlife,4.0,,Full of bars and restaurants its worth a walk around and a beer and you can watch all the sport there as well.
,,Go for the bars and drinks,4.0,,"it's better to dine at night by the river, windy and cosy. Would recommend eat at somewhere else and come for drinks and some late night snacks."

Singapore is very much a night city, things dont warm up until late, we could have done with another night here, there is so much to see and do, visit the old warehouses on Clark Quay. The whole area is fabulous and a tiny bit crazy. Beautiful in the dark!"
,,A stroll along the quays is always a good idea,4.0,,"In the bit cooler evenings it is lovely to walk along Singapore's Quays. Boat Q, Clarke Q, Roberson Q...they are all connected and each has it's own ambiance. Bridges and buildings are lit up playfully and there are food and drink options in abundance. You can also just sit on a bench and watch people. Or walk your dog. Or do your jogging there."
,,Bum Boat,5.0,,Well worth the trip on the river; good views of several landmarks and informative commentary included a visit to the Fullerton Hotel
,,Nice views,3.0,,"I don't usually like to eat here in the evenings because of the crowds and the touts and the generally average food, but the views out over the river and to the ACM on the other side are impressive. Lunchtime is an exception though as most of the restaurants have quite decent lunch deals which can represent reasonable value for money, although usually the food itself isn't so exceptional."
,,Look but don't eat there.,3.0,,"We walked on from Clarke Quay to Boat Quay looking for a good Chinese meal and walked the whole length. They are basically all the same so be prepared to be ripped-off. Eventually we chose one and had two simple dished and a shared bowl of rice + 2 beers, £70. They even charged us for the saucer of peanuts and hand fresh towels. Walk on to the end and go to the Penny Black English pub much better."
,,A bit of old Singapore - very rare,5.0,,Our hotel was close to boat quay so it was an obvious place for a walk and to eat cheaply. We return here every time we are in Singapore to savour one of the few bits which is old.

,,River tour,4.0,,Walking along the river you will come by Boat Quay where you can start the city tour on the river. I can recommend the tour. It is a lot of fun and relaxing.
,,Restaurants are a bit of a tourst trap,3.0,,"Boat Quay is quite a nice area and is certainly worth a visit during the evenings. It is just too hot during the day. Lots of bars and restaurants but really, the place is a bit of a tourist trap. Some of the restaurants are a bit of a rip-off there. You can certainly get better for less in other areas."
,,Awesome street for drinks,4.0,,"With ambience is just incredible. Most bars boast an incredible river view hence it's always windy and crowded. Most drinking places are pricy but if you wanna just kick back and relax. I recommend hanging out at the chinese restaurants riverside. They usually have great prices for drinks during happy hour and its a great time to catch the sunset. Yes, the place is filled with tourist but non the less it has a very Singaporean character, one which is definitely worth the experience if you're a thirsty traveller."
,,"Many, many restaurants",3.0,,"Boat Quay is not too special. I believe it used to be an import part of Singapore when boats were docked here and trading took place, but it is now occupied by many, many restaurants.

I'm not too impressed by most of these restaurants. Although some are quite nice."

Lots of restaurants to choose from whatever you feel like eating. It interesting for visitors to see the variety of the live fish for sale. I visited the Penny Black English Pub which I have done a separate review on. Its a lively place of an evening many people about. The boat trip during the day or evening is very pleasant.
You can walk from Boat Quay to Clarkes Quay which I think is more popular."
,,bum boat,4.0,,"love these little bum boats, its so relaxing just cruising up the river and checking out the sites and seeing the Marina bay sands hotel from a different angle.."
,,Best seen from the river,4.0,,We viewed this from the river and then went at night to dine. Enjoyed seeing architecture from the boat but disappointed for dining at night. Prefer Clarke Quay.
,,Nice place to walk and plenty of great places to eat,5.0,,"All the quays along the rivers are good places to take a walk and absorb the local scene. A good place to have a beer and people watch. Many good restaurants, some can be a little expensive but it is location, location, location."

,,Great night life,5.0,,"Myself and my wife had a great night around the Quays , loads of pubs but no hassle around both Boat and Robinson quays"
,,The boat,3.0,,This is where you can catch the boat cruise. Depend on day and time it might be crowded with tourist. If you have time and budget you can spend some here. Else you may choose to walk around somewhere.
,,Take your time to pick a restaurant,4.0,,"Having been several times to nearby Clarke Quay, we decided to swing the other way along the water and eat at Boat Quay...
As is always the case in Singapore, you should have a good look around before picking your venue in these places... The promised ""best deal"" can be misleading... However, the atmosphere and excitement cannot be over stated... And the beers always go down a treat in the heat..."
,,"Posh, expensive but quality is there",3.0,,"Impeccable and posh, touristy but not only. Restaurants are good but they ARE good in Singapore! Want a cheaper option to eat - Chinatown is nearby. The views, however, are better."

,,Tranquility,5.0,,Enjoyable visit and making a comparison this quay is a lot quieter than Clarke quay. More for the discerning diner. A walk along the riverfront is enjoyable just for that. Good selection of dining options without the noise from further up the river.

,,Great places for drinks,3.0,,Less than 5 minutes walk from Raffles MRT and is a hype among the workers after office hours. The price is not cheap but not so expensive
,,Good location for food and drink,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a great location for a meal or a drink, with a wide variety of food types overlooking the river and some interesting heritage buildings with the new Singapore close by.

There is a wide choice of restaurants BUT beware! There are touts everywhere and on quiet evenings they accost you to do a discount deal on both food and drink. Check carefully exactly what the terms of the deal are - both before entering the restaurant, then again when ordering and when the bill is delivered, as the restaurateurs seem to have a very short memory of what they promised to get you into their establishment. Our bill did not include the discount or free drinks promised. When drawn to their attention the restaurant reluctantly agreed to amend the bill to what was promised.

And the prices are tourist rates - eat at one of the hawker centres for a much more interesting social experience and a wide variety of great food."

There are Indian restaurants like Kinara etc, have Turkish and Lebanese food as well. Bars like Red Dot etc are also good place to chill out and drink. This place is very near to Raffles MRT exit and walking distance to Clark Quay. If you wanna try some Lebanese food then try Taste of Lebanese restaurant."
,,Must visit destination for both locals & tourists !!,5.0,,"Boat quay is one of the best location in Singapore, where one can find all types of cuisines - Italian, Chinese, Spanish, Indian, etc, on a half-Km stretch. The ambiance, next to the Singapore river is the best one can find, esp @ night. I would recommend this place to all locals & tourists to visit, esp at night as most of the restuarants, bars & pubs are open till late, some even past midnight!! One of the happening places in Singapore."
,,Nice Boat Tour,4.0,,Nice tour on the water all around Singapore. Many things that you can not see from the land. Guide was very good and explained things and answered questions. Goes by the ols statue that is half lion half fish and spouts water.
,,Good Place to Hang,4.0,,A mixture of tourists and locals make this an interesting place to sit and drink and eat outside next to the water. I would go again.
,,Worthwhile,4.0,,"Nice to have a wander by water and on foot. Good sights, varied places to eat, nice atmospheres Generally a little pricier, but goes with the location."

Also went here to grab some beers and stroll around the area."
,,Over Priced,3.0,,Nice spot with lot of restaurants serving fresh sea food. Good for a stroll but felt the boat ride was over priced. There are various kiosks where you can buy the ticket ($25 for adults) for 30-40 minute boat ride.
,,On river but over rated an expensive,3.0,,"Went to Boat Quay on first night in Singapore. Attracted to restaurant right on the water with free drinks. Don't fall for this this ploy. While view is nice right on waters edge, the food is average and very expensive. The restaurants can be the same company spread along the quay. While sitting there a local approached us an advised that there are other places that locals go and suggested other places. Boat Quay for tourists with average food that is very expensive. Don't be lured with the offer of free drinks. We listened to the local and from and found that Singapore can be reasonably priced if you know where to look"
,,The Pedestrian Mall,5.0,,"A perfect location for all relax on the banks of the Singapore river, be it tourists or businessmen. The multitude of cafes and watering holes provide a good opportunity to experiment the multitude of cuisines available there too."

,,For the expats mostly/,5.0,,"A great slice of Singapore to enjoy food/dinner by the water. Not to be confused with the Promenade which is just on the other side of Fullerton Hotel. This place is really great hang-out for drinks and foodies. Unfortunately, when we were there, the whole place was swarmed with expats. Did not really see much of the locals. All in all, still highly recommended for the view and choice of retaurants/diners."

,,Always a safe bet,4.0,,Always fits the bill for a bite to eat on the river or just a drink in a lively atmosphere. Great views across and up and down the river
,,A lively spot in historic central location,4.0,,"Located on the Singapore river, close to the Singapore central business district is Boat Quay, a really good spot to head for dinner and watch the sun set over the city. Loads of options of various cuisines - local, Chinese, seafood, western, indian, Japanese and many more are available.

The guys touting for business on the strip can be a bit annoying and the prices are definitely set for the tourists but the setting by the water and with the city's skyscrapers in the background can't be beaten."
,,Drinks and Foods by Singapore River,4.0,,Boat Quay is a wonderful place to unwind for Food and Drinks as they line the Singapore River. Good selection and atmosphere is great
,,Great dining,5.0,,"The dining and nightlife in this part of Singapore is one of the best attractions the city of Singapore offers. This area is considered ""highend"" so the dining fees are higher but the view of the river and lights is best at night."
,,Biat quay,4.0,,Walked here after visiting Raffles Hotel. It took us around half an hour. Sat at one of the waterfront cafes fir a cooling drink. Pleasant place to cool off and rest.

Bum boats travelling up and down the river (also a floating bar boat.) Always like to do this when in Singapore."
,,Relaxed Nightlife but be careful of Scams!,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a great place for a good, relaxed stroll - but be careful of the places you choose to eat - there's a wide variety of seafood places here but some might charge you a hand and a foot so be very sure to know what you're paying before you order (its tricky with seafood). But its definitely a good place to grab a drink if you're not into the party crowds at Clarke Quay and prefer to have a chilled evening. Many of the places also air live football matches so if that's your thing, this is the place to go. I personally like checking out the alleys behind Boat Quay for small new bars that pop up and of course some good hawker fare (Shah Alam has amazing Indian-Muslim food!)"
,,The core of nightlife,4.0,,Massive selection and various choices for any form of nightlife and any party scene required and/or boat ride along the river just to soak-in the view and revel anywhere along the river.

,,"Must See, Must Drink, Must be merry",4.0,,"If I were an Italian guy, I would probably bring my fingertips together, bring them to my mouth for a dramatic kiss, and say the word ""mwah"" when I talk about Boat Quay. Since I am not, I will just smile and hold up my 2 thumbs :-)

Also..... Must see! This is where Singaporeans and tourists go to make up for the boredom suffered during the day, catch up with friends, let their hair down, smile at strangers and have conversation. If you miss Boat Quay on a Singapore visit, you haven't seen Singapore at all."

,,Beautiful place and alive at night.,5.0,,There is a lot of restaurants and bars here and live entertainment as well. There is a great thrilling ride as you are shot into the sky by a slingshot whilst seated in a capsule. Looked like fun! The boats are there for sightseeing but they are especially good at night when the laser light show is on around 8pm. This is my choice area for a hotel stay in Singapore.

,,Clarke quay/Boat quay,4.0,,"Boat quay and Clarke quay are two must visit places in Singapore. If you are planning to visit this place on a Friday night or Saturday, get ready to experience crowd parties. A very good place to relax, have some good food and sip some drinks."
,,Super for night partying,5.0,,"In the evening and night it's a lot of people, lots of tourists but I think also a lot of Singaporeans, eating, drinking and partying to high prices. Try one night then go to other cheaper places also with a lot of partying. My experience is that it's safe more or less everywhere."
,,Visit this on a lazy Evening,4.0,,"This place is along side of SIngapore River and is one of the happening places in Singapore. There are many Restaurants, Eateries where one can enjoy both local and international cusines. You will find some shops as well. This place can be visited on leisurely evening along with friends, family or even alone."
,,Food and drinks galore,4.0,,"You are sure to find a place to eat or drink in this area, even if its just for an ice cream. A busy social place for the young at heart where sounds just overlap each other as you walk along the Quay."
,,Historic Ripples,4.0,,A walk through the park from across Furama led me to One Raffles Square and Boat Quay. Pigeons - real and huge statue - adorn this side of the Boat Quay. The area brings a visitor back to some of Singapore's historic palate.
,,A great vibe area alongside the River,5.0,,"I enjoyed my few evenings in Singapore walking along the Boat Quay. All along the way, there are open-air restaurants, shops, and other restaurants. It is a great place to people watch while enjoying great food and drink."
,,Better at night,3.0,,Boat Quay is pretty dead in the day. At night it is absolutely buzzing with yuppies drinking on their way home from work and tourists after the wonderful seafood. There are loads of restaurants with tanks full of lobsters and fresh fish to choose from. You might get fed up with the constant badgering as you go past trying to get you into their restaurants
,,Boat Quay,3.0,,Plenty to do and see on an evening but before lunch most places are closed . Also beware of cover charges and other surprise add ons .
,,Ahoy there! come and have a glass of grog...,5.0,,"Great in the daytime too, but really exciting at night time when all the shops and bars and cafes are lit up in this idyllic night setting by the old Quay, where once upon a time huge Chinese Junks and other vessels used to moor to discharge and take on cargo. There are many offers too! Each bar and cafe are competing for customers, so will try to entice you into a special deal they may have on offer. Safe place, so don't worry!"
,,excellent trip by night...breath taking views.....,5.0,,"We got this boat for a 40 minutes ride. you listen to English language commentary along the trip. the lights on the banks by night are charming. you will pass by the symbol of Singapore "" MERLION "", so you can have excellent photos. Please do NOT miss this amazing trip.."
,,Rather Dull,3.0,,Popped into boat Quay hoping to get either a late breakfast or an early lunch. Sadly no where was open and it was completely dead so I suggest you only visit this place by night.
,,A group of restaurants by the river - just don't go early,4.0,,We were walking back from the Merlion hoping to get a coffee or even breakfast. None of these restaurants were open or appeared to be interested in selling us anything. Didn't bother going back as seemed nothing special.
,,Grateful to BQ Bar,4.0,,"We were wandering alongside the Singapore River when I was overcome by the midday heat, high humidity and smoke from the Indonesian forest fires. I was very close to fainting and could go no further when we found a haven at BQ Bar. My husband helped me to a seat in their shaded outdoor riverside area, then he ordered iced water for me and a cool beer for himself. After sitting for nearly an hour slowly re-hydrating I felt that I could walk back to our hotel but found that I couldn't even stand without support.
My husband explained our plight to the staff at BQ Bar and asked if they could call a taxi to take us back to our hotel. The two staff members went out of their way to assist us by arranging a taxi to meet us at the nearest access point. One, June I think her name was, provided more iced water while we waited, then the male came all the way with us, ready to help if necessary, as I made the 50 metres or so walk to the taxi supported by my husband. So a big bouquet to this establishment from us!"
,,Boat quay,5.0,,This is a fun loving place on the beds of singapore river.you can take a boat ride in the day time and see the beautiful up rising buildings. In the evening you will find this place beautifully lighted with light reflection in the water below . People enjoying their drinks beside the river wit cold breeze to relax them after a tiring day .there are lots of restaurants on both the sides of e river . And for adventure u can try the bungiballon .
,,Nice place for a walk and dinner by the river,4.0,,"Boat Quay has lots of nice bars and restaurants along and near the river. We had lots of places to choose from and enjoyed a good view of the river and skyline while we strolled around and then had dinner. It seems to be a bit of an expat hangout so not the place to go if you are looking for a ""real"" Singapore experience."
,,Pubs..Clubs..Food...,5.0,,"Everything is there from local food, clubs, pubs, restaurants, etc.. Just beware of the Seafood restaurants, they are on the high price ! Great place to relax for a beer or 2 by the river side."
,,We had a boat ride 40 minutes,3.0,,We had a bit of time to kill we went for a boat cruise for 40 minutes it was good to see the buildings from the boat great view with a running commentary in English . There are heaps of eaterys places along the quay . Some of the old buildings were very colourful. Yes I agree with other people it is not like it use to be . things and times are changing more modern but it is becoming like a concrete jungle and everything is man made I bit false I suppose but while there enjoy the sights and food.
,,Your experience is dependent on what you do,4.0,,"Boat Quay is hyped as a 'happening' place because it is known to be a place for party and drinks, both to the expats and locals. There are a row of restaurants too, which means you can get to eat by the singapore river.

Beyond that, it is worth noting that there is historic significance to Boat Quay. This place used to be The place of trade for merchants and immigrants during the colonial days. Even after independence, this river was reeking of a bad stench before the government decided to do an overhaul and a major river clean up programme, which is why the river is so clean today.

You will not be able to enjoy the present and appreciate the place for what it is, if you do not understand the history of it. Yes, the place may be commercialised, but even so, if you seek to understand the history of it, you will be able to see value in the area and how far it has progressed within a short span of half a century. Don't be a shallow traveller!"
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Overrated and extremely commercial,this place, like the rest of Singapore, has completely lost its soul to the market-driven city."
,,Casual Quay,3.0,,"This place is very casual and the cheaper of the Quays, but if you're not snotty nosed then its a great night out, few places will do $30 between 9-12pm all you can drink spirits..... Cheyerrrrr"
,,Crazy Quay,5.0,,"Man, you want food, you have to have a walk around here, every type of food you can think of, name it, it`s here. Pretty reasonable too. Take a river trip while there too."
,,Old Singapore,4.0,,This is a real tast of what old Singapore may have been like. Most of the building go back a long way. The highlight is a stroll along a really diverse collection of barood places to eat any time of say
,,Poor Man's Clarke Quay,3.0,,"Boat Quay is the poor man's version of Clarke Quay. Some seedy bars that you want to avoid if you are not into girls looking for ""money honey"". Having said that there are some good restaurants and bars so stick to the North Eastern or business district end and you will be fine!!"
,,Just chilling...,4.0,,"Great place to wander around and watch the world go by. There are a huge range of cafe's, bars & restaurants to select from. A favourite spot each time we head to Singapore"

,,Nice boardwalk,4.0,,I walked around here both at daytime and nighttime and enjoyed it. The place is good for relaxing and hanging out. There are plenty of restaurants here so you can eat and chill by the river.
,,Great bars and restaurants by the river,4.0,,Great place to hang out with friends and family with great bars and restaurants open all day (many bars late into the night/morning). Visited many times when living there. One gripe is the constant badgering (as you walk along the streets) from the restaurants to eat with them
,,"Good food, nice view",3.0,,"Lots and lots of restaurants, though seem to have lost the charmto Clarke Quay now. You can find every cuisine on the street. Right beside the river, so the view is also good."
,,Nice place to hangout in the evening for a relaxing time,4.0,,Heaps of bars and restaurants lined Singapore river. Calming night scene to enjoy a nice cold beer and catch up with friends.
,,Amazing evening spent...,5.0,,"We spent an amazing evening wandering from Boat Quay to Clarke Quay - enjoying local delicacies on the way. Boat Quay is more happening than Clark Quay. But if you want to just sit back and enjoy the waters go for Clark Quay...

We enjoyed both of these equally.. all in all an amazing evening spent.."
,,Beautiful & Pleasant...,4.0,,It's a great place to visit especially around late evening when all the lights are on and there are people singing and playing guitars and other musical instruments on the bridge. Alot of seafood restaurants and bars.
,,"SCAM sea-food restaurants, Nice walk though",3.0,,"Take exit 'H' from MRT, you will reach right on the river front. Large buildings owned by banks right on the river bank. Nice place to walk in the night, walk till the Fullerton Hotel, Museum, bridges. U can also take a bum-boat ride for 22 SD.

Avoid circular road, this is on behind of Boat Quay, this is a 'shady place'.

This place is over crowded on Fri-Sat night, on Sunday and all other days, it is thinly populated, but u will find people taking a stroll till mid-night.

Sea-Food : Pls avoid any restaurant, which does not publish Menu in English or if the rates are written as per 100 grams. This is not the way to eat, you will easily land up a bill of 200 SD + per person.

Oriental Thai / Malay / ... food : Pls check the rates and inquire about portion sizes, you will land up paying 100 SD for two persons. This is less ripoff, but you will get better food in Chinatown at half the price. Don't fall for free beer with meal.

We saw some Indian restaurants, which were fully crowded. They will ideally serve chicken / prawns only. Their prices are reasonable and well written on the menu, the bills will also be presented in computer printed English.

Somehow, we thought we will have some different food and fell in a trap, ended up paying double the price for Oriental food (not of superior taste, large portions, double price). The patrons were so friendly that we ended up not arguing and paid.

Have a nice walk on the river and u can reach Clarke Quay / Robertson Quay. Have some drinks there (for riverside ambiance) and have food at a less touristy place. Elsewhere for 25-35 SD , you will get high quality buffet dinner."
,,Nice ...,4.0,,"Great way to pass an evening. Walk past the live seafood in tanks and maybe eat some! We'd overeaten at the Hawker one street back so just had drinks - BQs, I think. Very pleasant it was too!!"
,,Too touristy,3.0,,"One restaurant after another… restaurants, restaurants…food, food, and more food… But it is good to walk and see how locals, tourists, expats are spending their evenings. Some scenes are so amusing! Too touristy, I would say."
,,The place for a night out,4.0,,"Stroll by the river, savour some great food from any restaurants/bars that dot the area. Chill with the music, a great place to relax after a long hectic week at work.. A cool hangout for locals & tourists!"
,,Beautiful Boat Quay Area in Singapore,5.0,,"Boat Quay is a place one must visit towards the evening when it is lit up. It has amazing food joints with crowds throbbing in till late night to relax, party, enjoy the food and cool breeze. A must visit if in Singapore"
,,Site of historical transformation,3.0,,"This is one of the areas of old Singapore that was cleaned up by the new government in 1965 and by subsequent development. Quite an interesting place, especially if you reflect on its history, which can be a metaphor for the mixed transformations of greater Singapore itself."
,,Nice for a short stay,3.0,,Enjoyed some drinks by the river on a Saturday afternoon. Nice spot for a first time visitor but limited options. Much of the options looked very similar. Found Clarke Quay to be a better choice.
,,Great Nightspot,5.0,,"I'll have to say that this was one of my favourite parts of Singapore, if only because of all the restaurants and bars sitting in the old colonial buildings. In a way this part of the city still brimmed with some of the colonial charm that a lot of the other sterile shopping centres lack. Being along side the river, and being able to sit watching the river boats make their way along the river at night is nothing short of sublime. They also have a huge variety of restaurants, at least from what I could see, to the point that there could be something even for the pickiest of people. However, I just loved wandering past the restaurants, and always seeing something new to catch my attention, whether it be a fancy statue, or some crustaceans in a tank out the front of a restaurant. I can see myself spending much more time here if I ever returned."
,,Busy place,5.0,,"Great variety of restaurants where you can sit overlooking the river. Extremely busy place at dinner time with everyone trying to offer you food in their restaurant. Bars as well if you only want a drink with friends, with happy hours ."
,,Great local gathering spot!,4.0,,Loaded with restaurants and a people gathering spot in Singapore. Boat access along with walking and vehicle transportation. Other attractions located close by for sightseeing. Photo opportunities are available. Dreamt gathering place for locals and tourists.
,,Good place to go out with friends,5.0,,Another great place in Singapore to have fun with friends. Pay attention to the happy hours to get the drinks cheaper. All Bars are open and provide the guests with good music.
,,If you have time only,3.0,,"Very touristy. Unlike clark quay, boat key has only tourists and restaurants with bad food for tourists. The contrast between old and new is nice to see, but only if you have time."
,,An evening in Boat Quay,5.0,,Excellent place to hang out with friends and family - there are great food joints beside water front - I used to like to go to this place in the evening - extremely diversified and a huge choice of various type of food that one must try!
,,"Great food, expensive beer",4.0,,"Boat Quay is on the other side of the river from Clarke Quay and in my opinion it is better for food than its more famous cousin. From the moment you enter Boat Quay you are in the middle of many restaurants. You walk down a road with food on either side, the touts from each place try and entice you in with offers of a free drink and such. Take your time look at each place and select what you want to eat. Everything is there from Singapores famous chilli crab, thai, indian, tapas, western, all are catered for at reasonable prices.
There are also a few pubs at one end where you can relax and watch sport on the big screens.
Walk through one of the alleys to the road behind and you will find many clubs and bars open until late.
All in all I find Boat quay a more enjoyable experience than Clarke quay."
,,Nice for a visit,3.0,,Pretty Quay and nice views. Large selection of restaurants but all quite highly priced for the food served. Ate in one Asian and Spanish restaurant both experiences were pretty average apart from the views.

,,Drink and chill your night away~,4.0,,"A great place for locals and tourists to let down their hair and enjoy great food along the Singapore river, chill out and have some drinks with colleagues ans friends or even coffee or tea after your meals. how about a slow walk along this scenic place with your love one and take some pictures for memory. Come and enjoy this lovely place."
,,Same ho-hum place it was 10 years ago,3.0,,"Its an ok place to visit at night but don't bother coming here in the daytime as it can get really warm and muggy. Restaurants are at tourist prices and bars are ok prices which makes this area fine for bar hopping. River taxis I think still come here so, that's another option worth looking into. Its quite alright to just walk the stretch at night but don't expect anything spectacular."
,,Nice place to visit at night.,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a walking distance to Clarke Quay, it also have restaurants on both sides and all kind of strange and exotic food to eat. My son loved it because many restaurants had fish tanks outside for customers to choose what they want to have for dinner. They even had huge king crabs big as a cat or should I say bigger.... Anyway beautiful view of the river at night even you can see Marina bay sand."

,,Historical and Marvelous,5.0,,It is good to know the history of a place and seeing the difference between then and now. The Boat quay experience is both educational and a relaxing experience.
,,Lively at night. Dead during the day!,5.0,,"Boat Quay is a great, great place to go to in the evenings and particularly good if you are a visitor or have visitors as there is something for all ages. The whole area is clean, there are heaps of restaurants for every palate and there are great river boat trips too. With the free laser light show off the Marina Bay Sands a couple of times each night it truly is a must! I wouldn't recommend a daytime visit particularly as there are very few restaurants open (for obvious reasons)!"
,,Nice Place,5.0,,"Great way to head over to marine quay. Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are the very touristy nightlife locations along the Singapore river. Restaurants line the river with many waiters trying to pull you in. Loved the colorful windows and doors of the building, quite antique and old fashion in the middle of modern buildings."

,,Lively but pricey,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a visually charming location in a good spot, downtown on the Singapore River. Especially at night time it's a hustling bustling hive of activity. And I do mean hustling as every restaurant seems to have young ladies outside pressing you to come into their eatery. For me that makes it a bit too touristy and a bit more of a young person's destination. The food is also relatively pricey, though there's plenty of variety and plenty of it. Maybe it's a place to go once in your trip."
,,Be careful. We ended up in a bad restaurant,2.0,,"Be careful about the restaurants. Some of them might be cheating. We ordered food which was completely different from picture. The quantity was almost half than the picture and it was not even tasty.

Wish I could remember the restaurant's name. If I do, I will remember to post it here later."
,,Good tourist dinner place/trap,4.0,,Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are the very touristy nightlife locations along the Singapore river. Restaurants line the river with many waiters trying to pull you in. There are a few shopping centre located on the river too. I do recommend trying the Jumbo seafood restaurant on the river where you can get the famous chili and pepper crab.
,,Lovely at night,4.0,,"The boat ride is really pretty of a night with all the lights around the shore line it is just beautiful. Great way to head over to marine quay.
The only down side to the boat ride is the light show is on at night but the boat finishes prior to the end of the show, therefore making it hard to get back as taxi lines are huge."

,,Boat Quay - Nice Place to go.,4.0,,"Very nice place to go. While having a boat ride, you get to know the entire history of Singapore which is very interesting. Take the late evening boat, so that you can enjoy the laser show. Food choice is very high on Boat Quay."
,,Relaxing tour & sightseeing,5.0,,"Its a nice way to see & enjoy Singapore, without the traffic. Get your camera ready as you can easily take photos of the architecture, historical buildings, the icon of Singapore - the Merlion and nice art pieces by the bank of the river."
,,picturesque,5.0,,Boat Quay is a very picturesque place as you can see two sides of Singapore that relies on one common thing - the river. You see both skyscrapers and traditional Peranakan-styled shophouses which now are used as restaurants. About S$20 could get you on a river taxi/cruise that'll take you along the river. Really picturesque and near to other attractions.
,,Went for dinner at an Indian restaurant,4.0,,"The ambience of d place is mind blowing. Some cafes were playing live music. Dining by d river is an amazing experience on its own. Marina bay sands at d backdrop, and singapore's cool crowd makes it way too thrilling... A must for all"
,,Many restaurants to have a meal and a view!,4.0,,"Boat Quay is conveniently located at Raffles Place and sits along Singapore River.

Its lined with rows of shophouses that have stood the test of time through Singapore's history and have been restored to their former glory.

On the ground floor are mainly eateries and pubs while the upper floors are offices.

You can find many cuisines here: Japanese, Italian, French, Local Seafood, Indian, Chinese and more.

Good to visit in the evenings, where you can sit al fresco and next to the river to enjoy the view of the river."
,,Evening boat tours are the best,5.0,,Must do on a Singapore tour. Take an evening boat ride.Feel the sun set and the night lights come alive on the beautiful quay.The lighting on the various attractions is a work of art by itself and a pleasure to watch Also from the boat can be seen the musical fountains of Marina Bay. A sight not be missed!
,,Tourists mix with bankers in this atmospheric waterfront hangout,5.0,,"Touristy as it is, Boat Quay is a must-do on any visit to Singapore. The old godowns and shophouses have been converted into a string of trendy bars and restaurants, a few of which are surprisingly good. It is a place where many strands of Singapore come together - on one side of the river are the colonial era administrative buildings (many now converted to museums or hotels) on the other the bars and restaurants are dominated by the skyscrapers of the financial district (ask a local to explain the feng shui of the architecture of UOB Plaza). My favourite time to go is early evening when the bankers mix with the tourists and it has a more local flavour than later in the evening or at weekends. Best avoided during the day as the humidity can make sitting outside intolerable and most of the bars and restaurants have little indoor seating."
,,Average,2.0,,Nice if you are interested in a walk around the quay or grab a beer by the water-side. I would rather prefer Clarke Quay which offers better options to eat...
,,Beautiful place to have dinner!,4.0,,"We visited Boat Quay last evening and it was delightful. We had dinner along the river, which constitutes another excellent review, and enjoyed the night very much! It was our first trip to Boat Quay as we've visited Clark Quay several times. This is a more adult scene with a more varied restaurant experience. The one drawback, hence four stars instead of five, are the hawkers or whatever they consider themselves. I guess it is a competitive environment, but we kept being approached and invited into restaurants. It was a little annoying frankly, but overall the place is clean and beautiful. Highly recommend for a date night or for drinks."
,,Great place to take a walk at night,3.0,,"Lined by restaurant and boutique shops, it is a great place to take a walk before or after dinner. A little too hot during the day time. You can also take the river cruise."
,,Excellent place for night time,5.0,,We visited Boat Quay again and it is great for evening or night time visit.There are restaurants around which you can enjoy food from different cuisines.I really like the view of Singapore river with beautiful lights at night.Great for beautiful photos.
,,wonderful way to spend an evening,4.0,,"don't miss the amazing boat trips at night , gently sail through the waterways, enjoying a spectacle of lights omitting from the buildings that front the rivers edge, its a wonderful way to sit back and relax, taking in the sights sounds and smells of the Singapore nightlife

the area is filled with bars and places to eat, and many have evening entertainment, so a myriad of music is to be heard,"
,,Wonderful River Ride,5.0,,"Took a trip along the river had a great view of Singapore from the water, very informative and enjoyable"
,,so many food cafes,5.0,,this was where we stayed just across bridge. loved area so much to eat and good choice. Boat tour leaves from here
,,relax after a full day,4.0,,"Conveniently located near Raffles place mrt. A road full with bars, bistro and restaurant. One of the bar have nice singer on Friday night."
,,Chilli Mud Crab!,5.0,,"Fantastic place. So much to see and do. A great stopover, and we always add a day or two on just to 'do' Singapore. Fabulous eating too."
,,Go to boat quay by all means as it is by the CBD and the views are good but it is not the top sight of SIngapore...,3.0,,OK for a beer or even a meal but there are so much better parts of the city to explore. As you walk along the pedestrianised road every restaurant will try to tempt you in and the seafood looks impressive (albeit as a vegetarian it is not tempting to me) but please don't think you have seen Singapore just as you walked down here and ate at this location!
,,Ideal for restaurants and an evening stroll,4.0,,Comes to life in the evening - full of restaurants all of whom try to get you dine with them. Nothing surprising there then ! The restaurants are good and were just a walk form the hotel which made it even better.
,,Nice walk but you'll be harassed to go restaurants along your walk...,3.0,,"I love the view from boat quay whenever I do come here for a drink or food but I would limit it to drinks only if I had a choice just purely because I feel the food around here is average at best without the view there wouldn't be anyone passing by.
It's very nice to have a stroll here at night as the CBD is very nice when lite up"
,,Avoid eating seafood here,1.0,,"This was my second time in Singapore and I decided to visit Boat Quay with my boyfriend as it was recommended through Tripadvisor. Although the place was beautiful and less crowded compared to Clarke Quay, I must warn visitors to stay away from Forum Seafood Village. There are plenty of other food behind the waterfront, but if you must eat, I would highly recommend staying away from seafood and Forum Seafood Village. The view is spectacular, however restaurants like Forum Seafood Village will overcharge or mislead you regarding their menu prices. My boyfriend and I came in to this restaurants as they mentioned it was happy hour and ended up getting a couple of beer, some ""venus clams"" and one fish and our bill ended up being 252 SGD. We were shocked and outraged, however paid for the bill as we did not know how to argue with them being that the bill was in Chinese. Overall, I would highly recommend anyone to stay away from this restaurant. Your money will go much further at other restaurants and your pocket will be saved."
,,Boat Quay,4.0,,Lovely spot for a stroll at night with plenty of places to eat and drink. Can also take the boat ride into these areas. Be careful though if you are going to eat seafood - it looks like a reasonable price but is charged per 100g so the bill can be a surprise!
,,FOOD FOOD FOOD!,5.0,,I stumbled across this after visiting the asian civilisation museum. What a pleasant surprise. I ended up eating the most amazing Korean soup followed by real Italian Gelato. There are so many restaurants to pick and all look amazing! I went on a Tuesday lunchtime and the place was packed with city folk all tucking into lunch - but there was no queuing for seats which is very impressive.
,,a short promenade along the river at night,4.0,,It is very pleasant to walk in that area in the evening. It is very touristic but it is lively and pleasant.
,,Perfect place,4.0,,The place was very relaxing! It shimmers during the night. Love the food though! We've tried the seafoods which you can choose what seafood and it'll be cooked for you. Love to be there again soon 😊
,,Forum Seafood Reataurant a ripped off in price,1.0,,"prices of dishes were a ripped off. Cereal prawn of 6 pieces in small sizes costs $30.00. Chinese staffs were slow & un attentive, only 1 Filipina lady served wt smile. Never again wt that restaurant"
,,"So Many Choices, So Little Time",4.0,,"If it's a variety of cuisines you're looking for then Boat Quay is the place to go! Do yourself a favour though, it's not just the row of restaurants along the riverfront, it's the streets behind too and that's where you'll find the amazing places! Eastern, Asian, Western, you name it and you'll find it there. You get the overly expensive and the dirt cheap literally next door to each other.

If you don't enjoy your culinary experience at Boat Quay it's because you didn't look beyond the touristy waterfront. You are guaranteed to find more than a few places that will fit your taste and your wallet."
,,A stroll along Boat Quay,3.0,,This is a nice place for a stroll in the evening or morning after dinner or breakfast. There are many restaurants in this area to explore. After the stroll you can go to the shopping mall nearby to enjoy the aircon and buy groceries back.
,,Happening place,4.0,,"This is the place to go if you need a meal, drink or just to stroll thru the shops. You can also catch a boat to travel up and down the Singapore river."
,,Great Area,4.0,,"This is a great area for walking along the river and grabbing a bite to eat. Lots of places to pick from, so just walk until you see something you like."
,,Great Walk,4.0,,"Want to take a great walk with a view of the river and city, lots of resturants also. Expensive dinning, mostly expats. At night the view is awsume, get some great photos of the area and enjoy the evening."
,,went to a bar ... nothing special,3.0,,felt like we were in a bar in Mumbai... bollywood music (loud)... and girls dancing ... perfect place to waste your money after getting drunk. I was not drunk and I did not want to waste money - so left the place quickly.
,,Late Lunch by the Singapore River,4.0,,After 1 too many Slings we jumped in a taxi (seriously good value way to get about when short on time) and arrived at Boat Quay. Lots of places to eat and we had a delicious meal
,,Fun and beautiful!,5.0,,"Boat Quay is a fun, bustling, bar, party atmosphere along the Singapore river. A great place to go people watch."
,,Get rid of the touts,3.0,,Two different kinds of people come here. Tourists and raffles place office workers. The touts (while not as bad as before) do bring mood down while walking down the river but just ignore them. Lots of bars are busy in the evenings after work or when a sporting event is on. If you work in the area then it's very likely you come here sometimes.
,,Relax n fun,5.0,,"I stay with here in one of the backpackers hotel n it was great location
Night life is really happening...
With many restaurant, bistro, pub especially during weekend nights
Good place to hang out with buddies to relax and unwind
This place just a walking distance from Clarke quay, which is another hang out place(with sling shot)"
,,Too Touristy,3.0,,"I can't stand hawkers. And this stretch of river is covered in them. They try to get you to come to their restaurants, where the food is usually overpriced and mediocre."
,,"Great place for dinner, lunch or a drink",4.0,,"Called by Boat Quay, on a couple of occasions during our last Family holiday to Singapore.
Cheap drinks during midday happy hour/s.
Large variety of different dining options, very kid friendly, a little cheaper than Clarke Quay.
Most restuarants are on the waters edge.

Recommend having a stroll at night, and enjoying the atmosphere."
,,hangout,4.0,,"this is a good place to hangout in the evening. You can see the river. Even though its a bit crowded, the open air seats and food outlets make us feel attracted towards it"
,,Nice place to hangout in the evening,4.0,,This is a nice place to hangout in the evening time... The place has a lot of food outlets... Open air seats will be always filled up..... There was open air music event also going on the time I visited.... Overall the environment beside the river was nice to enjoy one evening ...
,,Romantic bar besides Singapore River,5.0,,"I stayed in a hostel near Boat Quay for one night and I really love the are. I can see Singapore River in front of my hostel. There are so many bars and seafood store but it's expensive to buy. But if you have a lot of money to buy it, it's okay then."
,,Would recommend lunch here and enjoy the walk along the marina,4.0,,We had a great lunch here.There are several restaurants on the water edge with plenty of shade.At lunch time they had several drinks offers which in Singapore is a bonus !
,,Old is Gold !,4.0,,"The oldest quay in Singapore. Its a quiet area with not much crowd in the mornings. However, the evenings are full of people and plenty of restaurants for foodies like me !

A Tip : Club the visit to boat quay with Clarke quay as well; With boat quay in the afternoon and then spend the evening and the night at Clarke Quay !"
,,Original quay in Singapore,5.0,,This is the eldest quay in Singapore so we really wanted to visit!! The quay itself is a stunning little area. Very quiet in the mornings bust busy in the afternoon and evening. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around and we could have sat all day watching the boats come and go. Also a great place for people watching!! Worth a visit if in Singapore.
,,Fabulous street side food,4.0,,A must go to in Singapore for the amazing food! Extremely good value and second to none in taste! So many restaurants to choose from.
,,Scam alert,1.0,,Beware as there is a lot of eatery here ranging from seafood to bars / pubs. seafood stuff is scam and the food is normal. i rather you go to reputable restaurant to eat rather than here. the bars sometimes is filled and its a good indication of which one is reasonable. police will come on and off as behind the river is pub where there is often fights. and people get killed there.
,,A step into the past!,4.0,,With much of Singapore modern it's great to visit this area showing something of Singapore's past. Alongside the river it's an area of restaurants and bars - offering sea food and also asian cuisine.
,,Good Location Beside the River,5.0,,Boat Quay is definitely worth a visit when in Singapore. There are lots of restaurants serving many different dishes. Seafood is obviously freely available but you can also find Thai and Indian food. This is a very old part of Singapore with all the restaurants and bars located in the old houses located on the riverside. We always visit Harrys bar as the food and service are brilliant.
,,Singapore River,5.0,,"When we bought the tickets for the River trip we also purchased tickets for Marina Bay Sands observation, at Marina Bay Sands Hotel &shopping mall"
,,Great place to find a cheap hotel.,5.0,,"Boat Quay is one of my fav place in Singapore. Many small restaurants, pubs for locals and for backpackers, hostels and small hotels. Walk distance to Marina Bay Sands."
,,A great walk around and amazing food!,5.0,,"Boat quay is a little row of restaurants full of food and clutter of glasses! If you want to experience local singaporean life, this is the place to hang around! You'll see people coming out from their offices to meet for a drink or two and chill out before heading home! you'll see a lot of travelers enjoying an amazing yummy meal by the side of the river and admiring the beauty of Singapore! What a place to sit by and unwind your day! LOVE IT !"
,,Idyllic,5.0,,"Great to walk / eat along the river, in one of the shophouses, next to/in view of modern skyscrapers"
,,Bank skyscrapers meet shophouses,4.0,,"Walking along Boat Quay, or sitting at a restaurant table along the Singapore River, the combination of Bank skyscrapers and Chinese shop houses (where the restaurants are) is always impressive. Of course with a view on the historical site of the landing of Raffles thrown in. Don't be deterred by the sometimes pushy approach of the barkers, trying to get you into their restaurant. You can always let yourself pulled in by the barker if the mood seizes you. A sit-down at the magic spot that Singapore River is, even more in the evening with sundown, is not too bad. But don't forget to negotiate hard about price, discount, happy hour and portion sizes. Otherwise you pay the ""walk-in"" price and that is always too expensive."
,,Plenty of choice,3.0,,"Boat Quay offers many restaurants and bars of all kinds, although most don't open until lunch time. Best visited at night you can have a nice meal or drink sitting alongside the Singapore River. Keep you small kids close since it is easy for them to jump in the river. Visit on a Friday evening to see true Singapore culture."
,,Good Choice of Restaurants and Bars,4.0,,Boat Quay has a huge selection of Seafood Restaurants and Bars and is especially beautiful at night as it is situated along the river. Its a hive of activity as everyone is out and about with the MRT only a short distance away. Its easy to get to and has other choices of culinary delights as well if your not found of Seafood. It isn't cheap but if your looking for a romantic dinner or a good night out then you can't go past Boat Quay.
,,Choice of a good dining.,4.0,,Boat Quay at night is an awesome place for dining and night lift. The view across the river and around offers a very romantic ambiance for a meet up and a perfect place for dining for family and for partying..!
,,Beautiful place for dining,4.0,,"Many places for eating, spoilt for choices and beautiful scenaries especially at night. a must go for those visiting singapore"
,,place to see night life in singapore,4.0,,"there is a lot bar here, actually i regret go here at noon, this place is best in evening, the feeling is wonderful even it is not evening"
,,Good selection of places to eat on the riverfront,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a great place to eat with many restaurants, or just to have a drink and take in the atmosphere or to walk and take photo's"
,,Boat quay isn't the same,3.0,,Boat Quay isn't the same. They've got sleazy bars. I miss the man Utd bar the most. There's this Spanish themed bar worth a visit. Their Filipino staff are both males and are pretty good at what they do.
,,Beautiful view touristy,3.0,,Old blend with modern building along the river near Raffles Place MRT. Very claiming and relaxing in city atmosphere. Lots of tourist type of restaurant with river view. Great for business meeting.
,,Tourist trap - but fun!,4.0,,"I liked Boat Quay - the views are wonderful if you get a table by the river, and there is plenty of atmosphere. It's fun wandering through Boat Quay as long as you accept you will be hassled by restaurant staff. Just two bits of advice:
1) Be very wary when ordering seafood - this is often charged by weight and can get horrendously expensive.
2) Negotiate and you will often get deals on drinks and meals - the restaurants are all keen to get your business. Look out for 'happy hour' offers.
We ate at Lanna Thai and had a very pleasant meal."
,,Too many touts,3.0,,"Most of the restaurants along this stretch of prime river front are fairly mediocre, and it's a little annoying as you stroll along here getting accosted by the various touts. If you come at lunchtime then there are quite a few good deals available, but it's warm outside."
,,Not bad for a stroll,3.0,,"It's a nice area for a stroll, a drink or a bite of food and some photo shooting. Nothing too special but a good place to spend a few hours in the middle of the city."
,,nice place,4.0,,"the cafe is very nice , many atractions and also very romantic , i want to visit again if i go to singapore again"
,,Westerner alley,5.0,,Great place for a drink and a bite to eat. All sorts of western cuisine and bars to match. Seems to be the after work haunt of the expats.
,,Avoid at all costs!,1.0,,"Naff, crass, rowdy and like something out of a bad Spanish resort in the 70s. Overcrowded bars with drunken clientele. Why this is deemed and 'attraction' I have no idea. We crossed the bridge towards Clarke Quay and found a small row of nice, civilised restaurants between the two celebrated Quays, thankfully, and had a nice dinner in Ricciotti. Won't be rushing back to Boat Quay in this lifetime...."
,,Easily one of the best places to chill out in Singapore!,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for a one-week vacation, and ended up spending half my nights having dinner and drinks at the Boat Quay/Clarke Quay areas. This area is especially beautiful at night, and even though the quay runs along the entire strip, you can't detect any ""fishy"" or ""salty"" smell of the ocean, so you can have a pleasant dinner experience right by the water :)

Boat Quay has a vast and varied selection of restaurants- anything from seafood to Mediterranean, Chinese to Turkish, Indian to Italian. Our most memorable dinner was at a Middle Eastern restaurant, but regretfully, I can't remember the name. Sorry :(

I also really appreciate that the restaurants along Boat Quay are open till quite late. Most of them stay open till past midnight, and you can order right up till 11 pm or so. Boat Quay is quiet, romantic, and you can definitely enjoy great food over some great conversation. Then after dinner, you can easily walk down the Quay for five minutes to Clarke Quay, where it is more boisterous and crowded with ""party people"". If you want drinks, dance, and music, here is the place to go after dinner!

You can check out more information and photos at my blog post here:

,,idyllic,4.0,,very picturesque. behind thise modern building this place architecture is really good. but eating there is very expensive!
,,It's Old Singapore with a twist,5.0,,Singapore seems like a very modern city with skyscrapers but there is a hidden gem. This is Boat Quay. Like stepping back to Singapore I remember. Small bars and restaurants and a great atmosphere. The people are really friendly and take time to chat. Sit by the water and imagine years gone buy or party like it's 2014
,,Can get very busy and a bit manic but worth a look.,3.0,,"We marked this as average because although it is well worth a visit it gets a bit too much after a while with so many restaurants and bars it was difficult to know where to go. We did select a bar which had its own beer (Red Dot) and had a couple of drinks and a snack there which were fine but it is a busy area and although you can sit by the river and watch the boats go by it was a bit hectic and I could understand some people being put off. However, we persevered and actually quite enjoyed the place once you get used to it. From there we went across to Clarke's Quay which is another story!"
,,Mostly down-market and touristy with a few redeeming spots,3.0,,"For an area right in the centre of Singapore, it grates that this place is still lined with cheap restaurants where the staff accost you as you walk by and almost drag you in. This is central, waterfront Singapore, and it could be so much better done: LKY and LHL take note, please.

Sure, the Penny Black's an old favourite, there's a decent tapas place and an Indian with a nice roof garden...but overall this is a missed opportunity, and time it was cleaned up and sent upmarket. The fact that the first place you come to from the banking end is McDonalds sums it all up."
,,Happening!,5.0,,"Very accessible by MRT and with some great dining options, and the promise of a walk by the quay you won't forget in a hurry - a must visit at least one night in your Singapore stay!"
,,Tourists and ex-pats' and locals mix,4.0,,"I like Boad Quay ... it has three very different sides to it: sleazy, touristy, upmarket. The road behind the quay is clearly red light with scantily clad young ladies inviting passers by into bars - there are also excellent food places there for local Indian / Malay food. Then, just walk down an alley to the main Boat Quay and it is full of tourists and ex-pats enjoying riverside dining and a variety of wine bars, pubs , restaurants and so on to fit most tastes. Then just behind is Raffles One with the very hip, cool, and amazing 63rd floor altitude bar with views of 3 countries from the top. Lastly, just across the river is the wonderful Asian Civilizations Museum. In essence, something for everyone all in one place in Sinapore - Culture, views, food, music and wine ..."
,,Sanguine Restaurants by the River,5.0,,"Another place one has to visit, stroll through and definitely eat, whilst visiting Singapore. Some say too touristy, but so long as you are alert, one can still have loads of fun. Dont choose a restaurant until you have walked right through. Many offer great deals on the night, such as no charge for beers etc. Great Sichuan Restaurant, and many good Indians. Offers al fresco eating by the side of the river, with cooling breezes or fans. We returned 3 times during our stay, well worth it."
,,Passing a serene and pleasant evening,4.0,,"A great place to unwind yourself or relax after spending a hectic day of tourist activity just for free watching other tourists sitting on the long and sprawling stairs or few benches on the river front Alternatively.you can indulge yourself in a good course of drink or food in the lines of restaurants lining the river front You can reach there very easily by METRO at BAYFRONT station We spent about an hour just sitting there admiring the clean and quiet surrounding reflecting the images of the neon signs and restaurants in the river.You can go for a boat ride also We ,being senior citizens moving around the world on shoe string budget carried very crisp fried peanuts purchased from 7/11 store being very careful not to litter the immaculately clean area"
,,Excellent for restaurants.,5.0,,"Boat Quay is known for its excellent selection of lively bars, pubs, high end restaurants and alfresco dining overlooking the river. Its a must do if visiting Singapore. What I enjoyed most was the original historical shop houses still are operating & have all been conserved.

We found Boat Quay after noticing on the river cruise so we decided to return there for lunch & had a wonderful cheap lunch at Harvest Seafood Café my chili crab was delicious.

We loved it so much we later returned in the evening for dinner & had another enjoyed meal at a different restaurant."
,,Good Food,4.0,,This area is a great place to get local dishes. The spicy crab is very good and being able to pick your live crab too. All the resturants seemed to be the same so pick one and go for it. It is a great place to people watch also. Take your time and enjoy the experience.
,,Great Atmosphere,4.0,,This area has a lively buzz about it which appeals to many particularly the younger generation of ex pats. It feels safe although can be a bit rough and ready in the bars and toilets. Credit cards are widely accepted in most places. Soak up the atmosphere and enjoy.
,,Overpriced and touristy,3.0,,"Having been to Singapore many times on business I'd never been to Clark Quay or Boat Quay. We went to Clark Quay first but found it too noisy and clubby and walked down to Boat Quay. Plenty of restaurants along the river here but the staff shoving menus in your face and offering you free drinks to dine with them is off putting. We ate at a Chinese/Thai restaurant that was so over priced we nearly didn't stay but we'd ordered drinks and were starving. $155 Sing dollars for three dishes, some beers and a glass of wine was the result. The food wasn't special and it's cheaper to eat in a nice restaurant back home. Wouldn't recommend Boat Quay."
,,"Nice view, good place to go for a cold beer",4.0,,"Boat Quay is a little bit expensive, like everything in this area, but its really about the location, which makes it perfect. Really nice to enjoy the famous green beer at RedDot brewery...it's worth trying :)"
,,Numerous outdoor restaurants,4.0,,"Boat Quay has a wide choice of restaurants to choose from, all of which offer al fresco dining next to the Singapore River. The river itself is a little dirty, but the riverbank is a pleasant enough place for a meal. Most of the menus here are a little expensive."
,,Busy & Lots to do!,5.0,,"River Cruises,Restaurants,Bars,Bungie Jumping and a nice walk around the area with lots to see!! Lots of families and had a nice atmosphere so I felt safe as a solo traveller!"
,,Awesome place to have dinner,5.0,,I just loved this place while we had dinner at Kinara. Atmosphere here was too good and it was fun sitting on banks of river and having dinner.
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,"This area is fantastic with a wide variety of pubs and resturants, it is lively till late most to all evenings"
,,Another Singapore riverside gem,5.0,,"As with Clarke Quay, boat quay is another we stocked restaurant and bar area. Its history goes way back to the beginnings of Singapore and the Chinese population. As a side note - it is well worth the time to do a river cruise and lean the history of this and other areas along the river.
Anyway, Boat Quay has a great variety of food offerings - if you cant find something you like here, you must be very hard to please!! The prices are not over the top either and most have some sort of ""attraction"" such as a Beer special or such where you do get to save a few dollars. My favourite here is Lanni Thai - grab a great Thai meal - fresh and authentic herbs and spices and a flavour balance that is just perfect. Wash it down with a Chang beer on special and watch the boats on the river with Marina Bay Sands Hotel in background. Heaven !!
Night time is again a laeidascope of colours sounds fragrances and flavours. Whats not to like about Boat Quay - and easy stroll from CBD hotels. I miss it already."
,,great atmosphere....a taste of old singapore,4.0,,"if you go to clarke quay or the marina, its all very new and extremely sanitized. if you go to the boat quay, its smaller restaurants and pubs in old buildings that have been spruced up a bit. its a good vibe that really makes you feel like you are visting an old historic city instead of something manufactured for tourists. its on my must see list every time i go to singapore."
,,Excellent Location to Unwind,5.0,,"I had been in Singapore for around 3 years. This is one of those places in Singapore where I would love to spend the weekends. Its a good place to be during weekends with the place teeming with life & lots of music. There are a number of pubs & restaurants along the river side offering a variety of food & drinks.Seafood of course is the main attraction. Weekdays however, the place wears a deserted look. If you are Singapore, this is one place you should never miss on a weekend."
,,Seafood,5.0,,Magnificent view to Marina Bay sands and the river and plenty of restaurants offering different cuisines and live seafood
,,Take a cruise !,5.0,,"We hesitated about taking a cruise, but finally decided to. In glad we did. The cruise up the river was wonderful, seeing all the city from the river. We went past the statutes on the river bank, under bridges, and around to the Merlion. Money well spent. A great photo opportunity."
,,The real Singapore,5.0,,"A nice place for know the tasete of Singapore. For travellers not for tourist. If you search the genuine Singapore, don' fordet this place."
,,Nice walk before choose your restaurant for the night,4.0,,"Arrive here by MRT Raffle Place, and you find a nice walk along the river, and on the end of the walk a great selection of pubs and restaurant.
The walk can go up to the other side if the river, passing the bridge in front of Fullerton hotel.
All restaurants stays on same side of this hotel, at opposite end of boulevard.
Firsts are english pub with burger and beers selection, then you find many Chinese with fresh (=alive) fish as usual to choose from aquariums, and also Viet, Thai, Indian, New Zealand, Italian, and more.
Just choose your one for the day looking at menu displayed outside and take a table outside to enjoy the view on river.
You also will hear the bells indicating hours from a church on opposite side, something magic for europeans!!"
,,Interesting,4.0,,My family and I had lunch and dinner here a few times. Large variety of restaurants to please all manner of tastes. We found the food to be nice and reasonably priced.
,,Chateaux,4.0,,"Cute little club in a renovated shop house in Boat Quay. Great service and great music. entrance was a little hard to find, but I think that keeps it from being overcrowded. Felt very exclusive with the velvet curtain and bouncer at the door. We spent about 3 hours there and had a great time."
,,Huge choice if you are looking for somewhere to eat,3.0,,Good place to have lunch or dinner on the water front or just back from the water. Many choices to satisfy all tastes.
,,Choice for Food and Water Views,4.0,,"Boat Quay provides plenty of options for good food and taking in the views along the river. The quay is lively and there is plenty to take in. It seems less hurried than in other parts of the city, and it is good to relax by the water over a good meal and a drink. It is a good place to spend some time and simply chill out.
Thanks for your vote if you found this review helpful."
,,A Peaceful Kind Of Busy By The Water,5.0,,"It's such a pleasure to come in from the bustle of the Singapore bar streets behind and find the serenity of the waterfront - well at least in comparison! Sitting at a restaurant - side by side for couples so that you both get to enjoy watching the boats glide up and down the river - was soothing. You need to arrive early to get a good restaurant seat, good service and to enjoy the change of light from day to night."
,,If you like food,5.0,,Boat Quay is a must in Singapore. Great food and drinks. Have a look around during the day and come back at night to eat. Plenty of good places to eat. Watch the Bum boats go up and down the river.
,,Nice place,5.0,,I havent visited the place For more than 3 years and it was amazing that it was the same relaxing place as it was before. I love sitting down at the gutter watching those boats sailing from boat Quay to the Other end.
,,Great Choice of Restaurants,4.0,,Good choice of all types of cuisine and a relaxing atmosphere on the river. We ate at a Middle Eastern Restaurant on the river and the food was excellent. Worth a visit.
,,Great Place to see.,5.0,,"We love Boat Quay. Strolling along the riverside seeing old and new Singapore, restaurants and shops all rolled into one. Many restaurants to choose from and lots to see. It is great during the day and great at night even though it is quite noisy at night. Lots of people out for a good night out you get caught up in the excitement of Boat Quay."
,,Lovely place for a night out,4.0,,"Wonderful restaurants and a nice walk along the bay. But don't forget Clark Quay, particularly at night - both have a great atmosphere"
,,Plenty of choice.,5.0,,We were staying in a high rise hotel very close to the river so there was no chance of missing this experience. It is a mix of old and new Singapore and definitely worth a visit. A pleasant stroll along the river takes you through some nice gardens and historical sites. Underpasses along the way keep you safe from the traffic and the good acoustics attract the odd busker. There are two main restaurant areas on the river front. The one at Clarke Quay is also a nightclub area which we found out on the first night of unsettled sleep on the 23rd floor! It is a noisy area even earlier in the night so would recommend the other area further up the river on the other side for older couples or families. Many many restaurants to choose from. I don't know if they are value for money or not because we ate there every night for convenience sake as much as the nice meals and spoilt for choice. Would recommend a visit at least once if you are new to Singapore.
,,"Overexpensive, average food but great view",2.0,,"If you are looking for good Street Food in the Boat Quay area and don't need to impress anyone joining your dinner table I do not recommend a single restaurant at the Waterfront. They are all overpriced. A dish is around S$ 20.- which is far higher than it at other places in the City. I would not want to pay up to 4 times the price just because of the view and the river. Should you not have any problem lining up and grab your own dish and bring it to a table I recommend ""BK EATING HOUSE"" @ 21 South Bridge Road, just to roads up from Boat Quay. The food is really good and reasonable priced (S$5 and less per dish).
The staff is more friendly at the BK than at the restaurants at the Boat Quay. I really love good food and don't care if it is expensive IF the quality of everything (Staff, Food, Location, price structure...) matches. Have fun eating great food in Singapore.
Cheers!"
,,Great view of the river.,3.0,,"we passed through that lovely street. There is nice restaurants both side, with a lot of choice, maybe because of the location. It is in middle of singapore financial center. We notice a lot of westerns in business there. To be honest a good place to have lunch. Also if you want happy hour drink you should go there."
,,A Favourite haunt of Ours,5.0,,"Boat Quay is located close to the Financial District and walking distance from the Fullerton Hotel. The Quay consists of dozens of shop houses built many decades ago with the vast majority of them are either bars or restaurants. Some of the best bars in Singapore are located here such as Harry's Bar and Molly Malone's. The restaurants are not cheap as Boat Quay is quite touristy, but if you would like a broad variety of tasty seafood this is the place to come to."
,,Great place by the Singapore river,4.0,,"This is one of the good places to cheap quality but cheap food in singapore, sitting right under the sky scrapers in downtown and by the river.

Most of the places here are local, no famous brands but are good in terms of taste and quality

I enjoyed my visit here"
,,Great night-time destination for the family.,5.0,,"We took a boat ride down the river to the Merlion - what a treat! Had a nice night out, ate at a waterfront restaurant. The crowd gets a bit rowdier later at night, but we steered clear of the ""party"" scene. We had young kids with us and felt comfortable in the area. There is also lots of shopping close by. Glad we didn't skip this during our stay in Singapore!"
,,"Good for relaxing, afternoon drinks",3.0,,"We arrived in Singapore after a long flight, dumped our bags at the hotel and set out to explore the city. A few hours in and we were flagging; so stopped off in Boat Quay for a pick me up drink.

For drinks we found Boat Quay a reasonable place to relax and to look out on the river over to the Fullerton area and to crane our necks to see the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

We did not come back here for a meal during our stay in Singapore as we felt that the restaurants weren’t to our liking; our preference being Robertson and Clarke Quays."
,,dissapointed,2.0,,"touristy, tired and a bit naff to be honest! . I would avoid it … looks quite nice when seen from across the water on a sunny day but when you walk through it feels dirty and dull! a bit of a disappointment I prefer the Fullerton side and the restaurants along from the Merlion on Fulleron Road."
,,Go take a stroll around this area.,5.0,,Boat Quay is a nice walking area near the river. you have restaurants all along the walk where you can dine and have a view of the river. really romantic and highly recommended if your a couple visiting the city. there r a lot of restaurants to chose from and atmosphere is nice.
,,Boakey,4.0,,"Lost in Translation. Some Singaporeans shorten words to what has become known as Singlish. It took me a while to realise Boakey and Clarky are Boat Quay and Clark Quay. Both are nicely
buzzing restaurant areas directly beside the river. I whizzed along here by Trishaw which you can do for part of the way before the pavement gets too narrow."
,,Average to Good,3.0,,"You could just about copy and paste any review for Boat Quay onto Clark Quay and vice-versa.

Effectively you will probably see this area if you walk by the Singapore River to or from the Merlion in Marina Bay, or if you stroll around the corner from the excellent Asian Civilisations Museum near Anderson Bridge or of you are dropping by to grab a photo of the statue of Sir Stamford Raffles.

It is a pleasant stroll along the fairly timid Singapore River though - like almost all of Singapore - is very very clean and orderly. There are food outlets and the like though the place is basically bereft of the sort of retail therapy much of Singapore seems devoted to.

Not something to go out of your way to see but something to take in while you are in the area looking at other attractions."
,,McDonald's Boat Quay Saved My Life,4.0,,"their 3 dollars burger packet saved my tummy... Well, McDonald's is McDonald's. WIth only 3 Singapore Dollars, you can get cheese burger, french fries, and Cola"
,,Black Pepper Crab Paradise,4.0,,"I've been transiting in Singapore about 10 times since 2009 and every time I was leaving the comfortable airport to go have have lunch on Boat Quay. The place is quite crowded but hay, there are more than 4 millions inhabitant on this small piece of land. Anyway, I tried a few restaurant and the best one was definitely ""Crab World"" with it's orange tarpaulin."
,,Good place,4.0,,"Look, I know the reviews of Boat Quay & Clarke Quay are mixed but you kind of have to visit both at least once. There are some good restaurants and some bad ones, there are some nice bars and some terrible ones, but in the evening it has a buzz so it's worth poking your head in."
,,Nice place to dine.,4.0,,"Just a five minute walk from the frenetic Clarke Quay, if you are looking for a quieter place to dine then Boat Quay has lots of waterside restaurants but be careful and choose wisely as the staff will cajole into dining at their place."
,,Rubbish full of cheats,1.0,,This is the worst place in Singapore !! So many lovely places to eat in Singapore so cheaply and excellent quality. Why would you bother coming here overpriced is not the word!! Just a total scam. Half the restraints here are total rubbish and the other half are worse!!! You have been warned. If you want to waste good money on substandard fare or you just don't. Care then go ahead !!!!
,,It's gotten trendy,3.0,,"I hate to say it but Boat Quay has gone trendy. It would seem that the trendsetters from Clarke Quay have migrated across the bridge and I can hear the rents rising as I type this.

It's only been 2 years since I was last in Singapore but in that time there have been any number of new pubs and restaurants opened on Boat Quay. It's all brass and glass and fake oak and too much neon for my old eyes. Even the BQ Bar had a neon glow, and none of the usual punters were seen either. The side streets and back alley are affected now too as the cheaper places get pushed away from the water front.

This used to be the place where you could get a drink at a reasonable price and some cheap eats too, even when it was a little later than the usual liquor license allowed. It certainly isn't cheap anymore.

There were always a few illicit card games going on upstairs from the restaurants and massage parlors, among other things. For some reason, the usual rules in Singapore didn't always seem to apply here. I saw a lot less of that on this trip, and I suspect that will all be pushed even farther away with time.

I'll go back of course, but I already miss what it once was.

I'm disappointed, but I guess it had to happen some time."
,,Enjoyed our night there,4.0,,"Nice place to go for drinks and food , you have lots of bars to pick from and it has a very good night life feel to the area :)"
,,"Used to be amazing, now just so-so",3.0,,"I always have mixed feelings about Boat Quay. On the one hand, I like the vibe of the place, both day and night, and enjoy the various seafood restaurants and olde English pubs on the sidewalks. However, on the other hand, it is very cramped around there, all the way from Clarke Quay right up to the Fullerton Hotel, and during busy times after work it is not only difficult to find a table and get service, but also difficult to even walk through.

I find that during the day it can get annoying as all the waitresses basically spot you walking past and then ask you if you would like some of their seafood. Feels like touting to me, although obviously no harm in it, but sometimes you would just like to get on with it, rather than being stopped all the while.

I don't think I would be alone in saying that Boat Quay reached its peak a few years back, and now is beginning to look a bit tacky and worn down. But maybe that's the charm of the place? I made this video experience, so you can see for yourselves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuhM1lPj4cY"
,,Great Clarke Quay,4.0,,"We just went here last night .Boat Quay curves around the shoreline of the northern and southern side of Singapore River. It's popular place for food, recreation, entertainment, and a pubbing lane . Even we also took a small boat to travvel around. Great place to come"
,,Great after work buzz!,4.0,,Took a trip here on a Thursday evening and was really impressed with the atmoshere. Super for dinner and drinks - we chose Dallas which was great.
,,Not as Good as Clarke Quay,3.0,,"Whilst the food and drinks were okay and the prices a touch cheaper than Clarke Quay, I found the variety and quality better at Clarke Quay. However, the big difference was in cleanliness whereby I found Boat Quay to be quite grotty whereas Clarke Quay was more open and clean."
,,Fun buzzy eating precinct,5.0,,"Lots of busy eating places and thronging with people, this is a great place to eat and watch the masses pass by."
,,Pub area,3.0,,the area is famous for eateries and pubs. though whole Singapore is costlier yet it is more expensive than any other area. one can have drink & dine in relaxed mood.
,,"Very high prices, low quality of food, small portions",1.0,,"Don't go there to eat. They are cheating you. Prices are very high. Portions are unbelievable small. Food quality is low. In our bill was included even wet napkins and finger size bowl of chips, which we have not ordered. Remember, that prices is subject to additional service fees and taxes. We ordered a roast duck. The picture showed us the duck breast. We have got duck leg with a bones. There was nothing to eat. Exactly the same was with the other food - don't trust the picture. We paid 200 Singapore dollars for 4 and went hungry. It is a trap for tourists. In Chinatown for a really good and a lot of food we paid four times less."
,,Lively and colourful,5.0,,"Loved the atmosphere, the nice cosy bars, the view, the river.
Our last hour in Singapore.
We might have got the rush hour after work, as it was full of people who were suited-up, but I don't mind, I am used to a similar atmosphere... If only the sun could shine like that where I live..."
,,Relaxing !!,4.0,,During weekdays this is quite a relaxing place to be. Lot of good pubs around. Restaurants are also good around this place with good food (with variety)
,,Part of old Singers!,4.0,,What a quaint area! We first saw it from the ferry as we did a boat cruise along Singapore River from Clark Quay and decided we would go back and have lunch there. So glad we did. So many eateries offering everything from a British Pub through to every kind of Asian and Japanese food you fancied. Wandered around for a while and finally decided to have lunch in the Penny Black Brit Pub. Interesting area.... certainly recommend a wander around there and next visit to Singapore we will do a night visit.
,,A beautiful quay.,4.0,,"This is yet another beautiful quay along the Singapore river. During the day, the heat is almost unbearable, as there is very little shade in the area, but after sunset, the place becomes almost magical with a superb lighting and atmosphere to match."
,,"Good pubs, average restaurants",4.0,,"In a nutshell, if you want a good pub, go to Boat Quay. If you want a good dining experience then go to Clarke. For me, the ""vibe"" over at Clarke Quay is more of a party vibe and the nights I went it was definitely busier. The Penny Black Pub at Boat Quay is my favourite and definitely worth a visit. It's nicely decked out and has a wide range of beers available. Boats for the 40 minute trip on the road Singapore River also leave from here as well."
,,Great Place to Dine Outdoors,5.0,,This area is one of my favorite places in Singapore to visit for lunch or dinner. There are several styles of restaurants here. It is fun to take your pick of cuisines and enjoy a riverside dining experience.
,,Expensive Restaurants & the Centre of Activity @ Night,4.0,,"This is the place to be seen at night. Popular with expatriates. Restaurants are pricey. It's a great area to walk around in the evening, as there are a lot of things to see, plenty of people watching, as well as a beautiful river front area."
,,Best seen from the other side of the river,3.0,,"The restaurants there are not the premium quality that one could expect from their prices. But it is definetly a nice motif for fototaking, with the skyline in the background and from the other side of the river or the bridge. after foto taking, head to clarke key for food. its equally expensive but way better."
,,Great Place to visit and have a drink.,4.0,,Very touristy but still worth it. Many places to kick back have drink and enjoy some food and people watch.
,,Expensive restaurants with shark fin soup,1.0,,The atmosphere was very nice at night that is the reason we came to dinner. When I saw the menu with shark fin soup I wanted to leave but was outvoted as we were tired travelers. All the restaurant s here are overpriced due to the fin location. Watch prices carefully as dishes listed as small are much more expensive if ordered in larger size and seafood is sold by the 100 grams. Don't go unless you must sit by the river.
,,Expensive Restaurants,4.0,,"The view from Boat Quay is really nice, especially at night. However, the food here is way too overpriced. We did not bother dining around the area and instead just looked for small eateries at the back of the street. This place is probably good for those who want to splurge on food while enjoying the views, but for us, a short stroll while snapping photos is enough. It's also a bit crowded at night although the environment is calmer and less raucous than in nearby Clarke Quay."
,,Centre of nightlife,4.0,,"Thanks to it's great central location by the river and near Marina Bay area and Clarke Quay, this probably is most popular place in night time. Bars,pubs and restaurants are packed and in New Year's Eve there were so much people, that it was real hard to even walk. So noisy, busy and crowded, but still one of the best places, if you are in party mood"
,,Plenty of choices,3.0,,"Having a short two night stay in Singapore I was recommended this place by a local. Although not spectacular it does allow for a choice of many bars, pubs and restaurants. Well worth a walk down and a meal in one of the places."
,,Overcrowded,2.0,,"The promenade to reach boat quay is really nice, and suddenly we arrived in that overcrowded place where the bars and restaurants are overcrowded and where you cannot sit and talk because the music is too loud. We've been living in Singapore for 1,5 yearn and went only once there..."
,,"Part of Singapore night life, love it or hate it!!!",4.0,,"Depends on what you are looking for but Boat Quay is part of Singapore night life, eat, drink or both and be happy. A lively place at night, part of the boat quay/Clark quay area with river view. Have had some great nights, some ordinary nights but overall if looking for nightlife, something to eat or just chill out try it. During the day it is part of the walking area around Singapore, something for everyone."
,,"Great views, not much else",3.0,,"We were looking forward to dining at boat quay and initially liked the look of the place. The views are good, especially as night fell. The food was expensive and forgettable. Don't go out of your way to eat there, enjoy the view and keep walking"
,,Good Location,4.0,,"Walking along the river, nice view that can see ""Marina Bay"". Along the river side are food and restaurant, if you want the nicer one just cross two raods, or underpass to ""Clark Quay"" or walk to Raffle place"
,,Could be better,3.0,,"Needs to be cleaned up a bit during the day, Night time it is very attractive with all the lights etc.,but the restaurants, although more traditional, are still rather expensive for what they are and the night covers the dirty bits very well. I think this is the most disappointing part of Singapore and needs to be brought up to the other attractions standards."
,,Pros and cons balance each other out.,2.0,,"Pros include:
A heritage area partly restored and partly rebuilt.
Relatively easy to get to.
Blends with Clarke Quay to form a larger area. (Indeed, I consider the two to be one area.)
Possibly, a good use for the waterfront.

Cons include:
Over hyped.
Prices that go with ""over-hyped"".
Did I say over-hyped?
Same-same as other places around the world.
One could imagine **much** more unique, characterful, vibrant, and/or good-value uses of this space.
Did I say ""derivative"", not very original?

It's not often that I venture from the heartlands into the city. I have never been a ""salaryman"" working in a downtown office building. If I had been, I might be more likely to visit Boat-Clarke Quay for a mug with mates before heading back home to the heartlands after a grueling day at the workplace. Or, considering the prices vs quality here, maybe not. As a value seeker, I would have to plan long and hard to maximize value from this area. And I might not be very successful, even after such thinking/planning.

If you're a visitor, is a typical neo-place with somewhat more expensive food/drinks, in such a quasi-restoration atmosphere a good place to visit? Or is a more unique-to-Singapore hawker centre or other venue a more authentic and pleasant good value? I vote for the latter, as there's a good diversity of such more unique places - in almost every part of the city.

But YMMV, of course."
,,Very dirty place!,1.0,,Singapore such small country the people don't know how to take care the tourist attraction . I as tourist such shame have place like this ..
,,"A little more traditional, but just as good as Clarke Quay",4.0,,"Boat Quay, a little downstream, along the Singapore River is a great place to spend an evening in Singapore.
If you compare the two, Clarke Quay appears more upmarket but the restaurants at Boat Quay, though they look simpler, are not cheap. Clarke Quay has more variety in it's choice of international bars and restaurants while those at Boat Quay are more traditional.
The Penny Black Victorian English Pub is a lovely place to start the evening. Forum Seafood has great Chilli Crab but ridiculously expensive....
Both Quays get very lively in their own way in the evenings.
From Boat Quay you get a view of three different eras of Singapore's timeline, it's old colonial buildings, the modern business district and behind them you see the new Marina Sands casino and hotel buildings."
,,Even tourists should give it a miss,1.0,,"Loads of hawkers selling horrendously expensive food, that on promo, is slightly cheaper expensive. Upselling the whole time, most food was charged by the 100g, and that can provide for an expensive surprise.

Comprehension of English was almost certainly being used as a way to upsell. You eventually get tired of trying to explain or understand the offer, and I suspect that was on purpose.

Satay was $2 a stick, same price as the Long Bar at Raffles, but basically fat on sticks, absolute rubbish. Save money, and go to Raffles instead For a much better experience. (Ok, drinks at Raffles are more, but, goes to say Boat Quay is a waste of time.

Quality of food and taste was woeful, only redemption was the view, so if it's the view you are after, stand to one side, take a photo, and move on. This area is a ripoff from start to finish."
,,Dinner out with the team,5.0,,The Boat Quay has lot to offer we a a team of 3 with my boss visited and had the best food served. The chicken with varied taste and the deep sea fish taste was awesome and for a team out it was a good place.
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,Great choice of bars and restaurants - something for everyone and far less raucous than nearby Clarke Quay.
,,BQ Bar - Boat Quay,5.0,,"If your coming to Singapore, head down to boat quay and hit up BQ Bar, great atmosphere, good people and good food.. Stick to the waterfront for a night of enjoyment and meeting random people, head down the back of boat quay for local food!"
,,Great night life!,4.0,,"Like everything else in Singapore, going out is bloody expensive! But if you don't care and are looking for a good time to hang out, drink, dance and sing Boat Quay is the place to go!

There is everything you could want for a great night out. live music, open air seating and plenty of pubs if you're hoping to catch a football match from Europe or the like :)"
,,very nice and interesting,4.0,,"Walking in the evening is a best choice, very sparkling. I think this place is one of the most eventful place in Singapore. there were a lot of entertainment activities, collecting a chain cafe shop and luxury restaurant. It's really ideal when enjoying a cup of coffee and seeing the view of mixed light. Also, the food in there were tasty. the price were quite expensive but I think It's worthy. Specially, The music in pubs and clubs were wonderful."
,,Romantic by night,4.0,,Enjoyed a cruise of the harbor with the amazing view of the city lights. Many good places to eat too but can be pricey along the waterfront. The area also makes for a nice stroll day or evening.
,,Go at Night,4.0,,"Great views, especially at night. Good atmosphere. Plenty of food options for all tastes. Went during day, and back at night."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"I have enjoyed walking by Boat Quay especially in the evening, but to be honest Clark Quay is better for me. It was Christmas time so whole town was in that mood and I liked it so much as it was my first Christmas away...More"
,,Come food with a view,4.0,,This is a great area if you are not sure what you want to eat tonight. Lots of restaurants and bars serving just about every type of cousine. You will have to come early or out of peak times if you want a table by...More
,,Old and run down,1.0,,...most restaurants were closed. Dirty and uninviting. Keep walking a little further to Clarke Quay.
,,Amazing Place to Eat,5.0,,"Perfectly Located near the marina area as well as the Downtown the Boat Quay is the perfect place to eat and stroll around...U name the Cuisine and u will get there from Asian to Mexican,,From Mc Donalds to Chicken Masala..Good place to have Dinner"
,,Lively and full of restaurants,4.0,,Boat and Clarke Quay and both very lively and full of restaurants. The atmosphere in the area is very good and there are things to see and do. Better in the evening
,,This place has lost its sparkle.,3.0,,"The Good =) ~Many F&B outlets. ~Near walk from City Hall MRT. The Bad =( ~Used to have many touts along the main walkway. ~Because of high rentals, some outlets maybe over-priced. My Tip for future visits: ~Go to restaurants that are well-known with locals,...More"
,,Lovely way to see singapore,5.0,,"I think they are called ""bumm boats"" cost was $60 for a family of 4, we did this one evening at 5.30 and it was lovely perfect setting cruising slowly and taking in all the sights with marina bay sands and clarke quay. A must...More"
,,Boat Quay,2.0,,Plain and simple boat quay is an overpriced tourist trap. Weekends especially Friday nights is too overcrowded and restaurants are touting for your business like Tenerife 20 years ago. Came here four years ago when it was a little better but has gone downhill in...More
,,Time to relax with Chillax,4.0,,"Boat quay, worth it for its relaxation and it's continental cuisine with a Chillax drink, sightseeing around Clarky the atmosphere of the city view finds fantastic. Can be really enjoyed with family and couples and even with friends."
,,Good for the food,4.0,,Have one of the best lobster there.....was staying at one of the hostel there so was eating every night there
,,Just one of the Restaurant Areas in Singapore,4.0,,"While it is just one of the restaurant areas in Singapore, and we are all too aware that Singapore offers a variety of food styles. It seems to be where east meets west when it comes to eating, and this is partly true in the Boat Quay locale, although mostly east here!
I liked the location mostly because of the proximity to the water and the atmosphere at night, however there are better restaurants in Singapore. If, however, you want ambiance and a nice walk after dinner then this is a good meeting place to start... maybe even take a ferry across to Marina Bay Shopping Centre."
,,Not as good as I expected,3.0,,"There is a string of riverside restaurants at boat Quay, all seemed fairly similar although there were a few Indian restaurants along the way. After doing the lap a couple of times we chose one that had nice photos of the dishes displayed out front. The food was good and the service was okay."
,,If you want a relaxing drink and some ok food by the river with a really nice view then go to Boat quay,4.0,,"You go to Boat Quay because you can have food and drink from a variety of restaurants overlooking the river in the outdoors. As a tourist I think you need to see it. I have been to Singapore 10+ times and still go. Yes it is a little over priced but Singapore is expensive anyway and so just go and see what it's like and then decide if you want to pay the prices. The restaurants are not formal and you can wear shorts and t- shirts and have a selection of local and international foods. As you walk down you will be politely approached to enter the variety of restaurants and you can have a bit of fun negotiating a deal ie a few few drinks or snacks.

Personally I have had a few good meals here but for the me sitting overlooking the river and taking in the sights including the Fullerton hotel lit up and see the river taxis go up and down and take in the surrounding atmosphere is very nice.

Imagine you are thirsty and tired and you need a chill out. Well pull up a chair and ask for a table by the river. Get an ice cold drink and watch the world float by....."
,,Boat Quay Singapore,5.0,,"I agree Boat Quay is over priced, i have visited the same restaurants after a 10 year absence and found the quality of the food to be pretty much the same.
Both boat and Clarke Quay have now moved onto a total Tourist attraction, in doing so, something really cool about both areas has been irrevocably lost, if you never experienced these two once wonderful areas you wont know what your missing

However you should consider trying out some of the establishments along River Valley Road, especially if you are passing by in the early hours of the morning get some indian food breakfast at 3 30 am cheap and cheerful and quality

Singapore never sleeps go out late and enjoy"
,,"Great setting, expensive, busy and noisy",3.0,,"Typical tourist location with some locals and finance Friday night drinkers. Lovely to see the city at night, against a watery, lit backdrop. Same food sold at most vendors. Food ok, but nothing special."
,,Good looking spot but overpriced and poor food,2.0,,"Boat Quay is a great place to take a stroll in the evening and see some of Singapore's nightlife and skyline. I highly recomend you do not eat here unless you want to enjoy the river view, the food is very expensive and generally poor. Better go one or two streets away from the river front and here you will find much better value for money.

I was ripped off once and had to pay $330 for four persons. This was especially sore bacuse the night before we paid $50 in a hawker center and the food was much better there!"
,,"Nice place near the river, to have a nice dinner or drink the night",3.0,,"The newly renovated part of an old Harbour district. It has a long row of bars and restaurants, both Inside and outside. Many people, not least those who work in the adjacent Financial district, usually gather here in the evening. I went, sitting by the river, in a chinese restaurant. The view was nice but restaurants are expensive and food very average.

To go there take the MRT to Raffles Place."
,,"Nice ambience, but pricey!",4.0,,"It's a good experience dinning beside the Singapore River. This area is made up of restaurants that serve mainly seafood. Restaurants here usually offer 1 Free drink and 30% discount on the dishes to attract customers.

Foods are definitely pricey. Crabs are at least S$8 per 100g (a crab usually weighs 1kg and above). We ordered one with 1.3kg so it's already S$100. Fried rices are overpriced, 1 plate costs around S$18-22. Small bowl of soup costs S$8-12. A plate of veggies costs around S$18-20.

Seafood and soups are great, but not the fried rice. Veggies are average. We spent S$160 (after discount) for a dinner for 2.

If you are on a budget and not interested in a pricey dinner, it is still worth visiting this place for a nice walk in the evening."
,,Great fun! Great food!,5.0,,"I loved Boat Quay. I went on a Friday night and the atmosphere was fun, friendly and full of energy. There is a string of fantastic restaurants selling a variety of wonderful food, and several pubs selling cheap drinks too."
,,Must go for Alcoholic lovers !,4.0,,"Boat Quay has a Nice ambience...It is a place where you can drink along side river with lots of people around. You can find slots of Bars, clubs with some good sea food & even some restaurant offering musical live performances.
If one pass by it & go just opposite of it one can find a excellent scenarist view of Singapore. Lots of skyscrapers along side the river ...will find lots of people taking photos. It is a good place for spending around 1-1.5 hours of time.
Boat Quay is close to MRT Raffles place just 2 min walk,"
,,Good to walk throguh but...,3.0,,Very good to walk through or cruise past on the river with some great architecture and photo opportunities. Proably give the food and drink options a miss or at least be aware that cheaper and fresher options (where the locals eat) are found elsewhere. In Singapore good places to eat should not be relying on touts. A bit touristy. That said it is at least an eating or drinking option. Overall not too bad but I eat where the locals eat.
,,Seafood restaurants on Boat Quay,2.0,,"being less upmarket than Clarke quay we expected better value here. In fact they are all doing big ""rip off"" on prices for pepper or Chile crab. Drag you in with offer of first drinks free, then try to sell you a crab dish for Sg75/90 per person. depending on the size of the crab... total ripoff.. Sg8 per 100gm or whatever. We walked out, after paying for the "" free drinks"", whole string of restaurants doing this. No prices on the menu, so you dont know how much it will cost until after you order..."
,,Good selection of bars restaurants and clubs,4.0,,"The go to place for expats in singapore, can be expensive and touristy but still offers a fun night out with plenty of choice. Take advantage of happy hour deals and credit card one for one meals."
,,Drunken expats and restauranteurs haggling for tourists,1.0,,"The pubs are fun and the bars similarly, but it is frequently spoiled by drunken expats and restauranteurs haggling for tourists. The beer is amazingly expensive and the selection is not singapore's best by a long shot. It's also relatively characterless."
,,A nice place to visit....,4.0,,"Boat Quay is one area along the Singapore River that is made up of restaurants that serve mainly seafood. Great view of the CBD (Central Business District) and you sit right on the river. When you are walking through, the servers are a little more assertive when offering you a meal. If you are not interested, simply say 'thanks - we've eaten' and walk on. There are a few pubs along this section as well. I like it better in the evening but the day views are nice too. Prices (as with many places along the river) tend to be inflated. Atmosphere is good. To get a picture of Boat Quay, head directly across the river along the promanade. Bring your camera. Take the MRT (Raffles Place station). A nice place to visit...."
,,most restaurant staff is pressed to make money,2.0,,"Boat Quay, a lovely site of Singapore, but!
Be careful with the selection of a restaurant at boat quay!
The staff is pressed to make money. Check the price on the menu and check the bill!
The price of 25 SGD for pine-apple rice and 6 SGD for a small bottle of mineral water is maybe the upper price category.
When finally the waiter deducted the beer and nuts (which I did not order) from the bill it came to a total of 36.50 SGD. Singapore is usually famous for tasty food and good service.
FUQING Seafood Restaurant did not achieve the standard."
,,Beautiful place to visit,4.0,,Best time to take a boat is around 6-6:30 pm. You can enjoy the view in day light as well as light lights. Its awesome in night too.
,,Nightlife is here!,4.0,,"With a great variety of restaurants and bars, this is the place to be at night, go out, and have some fun, while overlooking the beautiful canal, in the middle of downtown Singapore!"
,,Water-side Walk,5.0,,"It's a bit touristy along the water , but you can get great views of the Marina Bay Casino at nght from the waterfront eateries. If you go one block in from the water it's a whole different local scene that is worth exploring."
,,Overpriced restaurants,2.0,,Seafood restaurants are generally overpriced. What a rip off eg S$18.00 for the tiniest sized Singapore noodle dish.
,,Utter scam be very scared,1.0,,"PLEASE READ THIS

Be very very careful in any of these restaurants but most particularly any of them who are charging for food by weight, you will end eating a normal portion of lobster but will then receive a bill for a totally alarming amount - it is a scam, it all seems very normal and you think hey I'm thinking this will cost £100 or something like, check the small print and consider yourself robbed when you receive a bill for £400 as you surely will, my best suggestion is DO NOT EAT HERE!,"
,,Go after sunset,5.0,,Take a leisurely boat ride on the Singapore River. The buildings and bridges look spectacular when they are lit up. The view from marina bay is very good. This place really comes to life at night. There are a variety of places to eat by the riverside.
,,It's where the city goes for lunch and a drink after work,3.0,,"The restaurants aren't the best...but they do what they do..
The bars are always full and lively ..especially on a Friday and on events like St Patricks Day etc
More popular with ex pats..and on the route of walks that tourist go !
Of course if you have never been there...you will go ..
and of course if you live there...you will still go once in a while
It's Boat Quay"
,,We prefer the northern side of the Singapore River at Boat Quay,3.0,,"Not huge fans of the southern side of the Singapore River in the Boat Quay area where the restaurant touts intently try to persuade you into their riverside restaurants. This is more resemblant of less developed places in SE Asia and somehow doesn't seem to belong in the clean, tidy, proper Singapore!

If you take the northern side of the river, you will find a quiet, pleasant riverside walk. It is a very nice area to transverse between Clark Quay and Marina Bay. This is a walk we have enjoyed making over the years and is very much a nicer area to walk in the Boat Quay area.

Here you can also see the Landing Site of Sir Samford Raffles, marked by the statue of this historic figure. There are a couple additional statues of historical scenes found along the waterfront in this area as well as busts of important Asian leaders of the past, just in front of the Asian Civilisations Museum. We also like making a quick stop by the historical Cavenagh Bridge at the end of the Boat Quay area before making our way onward to the bay.

Overall, we've mixed feelings about Boat Quay - quite enjoying the northern shore but not much caring for the activity on the southern side."
,,A lovely charming place.,4.0,,"Is a beautiful corner of Singapore, one of those places where at first glance you remain speechless.
Along the river which crosses the city in one of the most famous old side of the city, a few hundred meters from the Clarke Quay MRT station and a 10-minute walk from the Marina Bay on the banks of the River along this waterway a host of pubs and restaurants, a very beautiful and picturesque especially in the evening with its many lights illuminate the entire outline, making it even more pretty, although I must admit that the prices of the restaurants are quite high, but in any case it is a very lively and full of people until late evening.
Along the embankment of the river built in steps in the evening lots of people sitting and talking to populate this fantastic place."
,,Clubbing,5.0,,"Met up with some old and lost friend there and had a great night out with them it was the crazy elephant if i am not mistaken, lots of drinks and good music there."
,,quite noisy,4.0,,"We visited on St Patricks day, lots of irish themed parties going on, we didn't stop to eat, but there was plenty of choice, looks very good from the river boat though"
,,Ripped off,1.0,,"Please watch out if your coming to Singapore for a holiday or trip and you find yourself at boat quay looking for something to eat.
I have lived in Singapore for nearly 20 years now and brought a friend to boat quay last week for dinner, we ate a Thai restaurant, we only had the following, stingray , frogs legs a vegy dish , pineapple rice and 2 beers, now I know for a fact anywhere else this would have only cost 50 to 70 dollars, so when the bill came and it was 247 dollars you can imagine my shock.
The trouble is my friend paid and it was not until he had settled the bill with his credit card did I find out how much it was.
I felt terrible as it was my idea to bring him there.
There was a couple sat on the table next to us disputing their bill when we turned up, I did not think much of it at the time, but now I know why.
The trick they pull, is to repeat you order back to you very quickly, and as they walk away say ""large"" or ""big""... If you look at the menu you will see a small portion is 12 dollars medium about 18 then large jumps up 50 or more, the thing is you not getting a large potion your just paying for it.
So be warned"
,,"OK from the water, so-so from the quay",3.0,,"It's never a bad idea to hop on a river sight-seeing cruise in Singapore and enjoy the view. Things always look so difference with a perspective from the water. Boat Quay, settled bravely right next to the massive financial giant's skyscrapers, like it's defending its right to exist, still gives you the feeling that once there was more to behold in Singapore than just concrete and steel. But when you set foot on land, you quickly realize the past is the past. Today, there's little more to find here than mediocre restaurants and a few bars aimed at a western drinkers crowd. There's nothing wrong with it, really, but many will call this place a 'tourist trap'. I had dinner here a few times, and lunch, and a few drinks (see my review of The Penny Black, London pub) and it was never spectacular, nor bad. At night, if you get a table by the water, the view over both the old colonial centre and the new district is very good, though. But Boat Quay should be worried about its right to exist in the long run. With Clarke Quay just a short stroll away, a 'tourist trap' as well but with a totally different style, I see little unique benefit in Boat Quay, other than maybe a few dollar less per order."
,,scam,1.0,,"if you are coming here for the seafood or whichever i will have advise you do not come here. as the food here is high priced and they only target innocent tourist. if you are visiting the pub , you can get a nice view of the singapore river."
,,Restaurant and bars,4.0,,"Beautiful scenery at night, lots of bars and restaurants to chose from!

You can take some time and stroll around the river side after meal, and walk to the nearest MRT at City Hall or Raffles MRT, they're really close by...

And it's romantic to go around with your other half and spend some time to enjoy the breeze"
,,Fun to wander,4.0,,"Lots to see and do. Great for taking photos and learning about the history and founding of modern Singapore. Plenty of museums nearby, too. Not to mention great dining at one of many seafood restaurants."
,,Boat Quay - The Entertainment centre,4.0,,"Boat Quay is an amalgamation of clubs, bars and restaurants. The best prawns I have eaten was from one of the restaurants there. It was heavenly. A great place to spend an evening or a few evenings."
,,Tourist Trap and Rip Off,1.0,,"Boat Quay may be a good place to have a drink.
However, if it comes to food and restaurants, better stay out of this area. The chances of you getting ripped off are very high.
I once had a really bad experience for a business dinner.
The food in the restaurant was average at most but the prices were sky rocketing.
We ended up paying 450 SGD for a dinner that would have cost us less than half at place like Jumbo Seafood.
Recently, I had visitors in town and they got caught in the rain in the early afternoon. As the rain was extremely heavy, they decided to have lunch while waiting for better weather.
The restaurant did not show any prices on the menu.
On the bill, they found out that they were charged 28 SGD for a plate of fried rice!
They ended up paying 120 SGD for a simple lunch with 3 dishes and 2 glassed of beer.
Even at Newton Circus, which has its own fair share of negative and overpriced stalls, it would have cost only a fraction of this for the same amount of food.
So enjoy a drink or two at any bar or restaurant along the river but look for other places to have a simple meal!"
,,Entertainment Hub,4.0,,Local entrepreneurs have created a mélange of eateries and nightclubs to satisfy diverse tastes at this popular entertainment hub along the Singapore River. Between 7 PM and midnight the area swells with people strolling along the pleasant quay.
,,Restaurants,3.0,,"Good selection of restaurants, fresh seafood. Food was excellent and well priced. It was nice to sit at the edge of the river with a cool breeze."
,,Eats,4.0,,"Any type of food you like ,lots of live in the tank seafood,fresh caught and beautifully,tastefully cooked,cold cold beer ,Both Western and Asian style cooking available,my favourite place to eat lunch in."
,,Going downhill slowly but surely,2.0,,"When the riverside project first got off the ground it was a godsend for Singapore. Bars and eateries along the river, outdoor seating, nice views and so on. Over the years, the quality of the restaurants has, for me, taken a dive. The next biggest gripe is that many of the remaining restaurants (many change hands quite frequently) utilise touts who annoy the heck out of passers by and some are pretty overpriced. Walk along and have a look and a drink by all means if you can put up with the touting nonsense but there are other spots not too far away where you can get the waterside experience without the hassle - notably Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay. The tenant's association tried to resolve the touting and over charging problems last year but it soon fell apart and it went back to normal. It's rare that I'll eat on Boat Quay and until the authorities act against the touts, the quality of the eateries improves and the overall atmosphere is thereby lifted, that's the way it's likely to stay."
,,a neutron bombed theme park,1.0,,"Like so many historical sites around the world, there has been an attempt to capture what the place was like simply by saving the architecture of the place. True, it is a nice place to walk through but you have to have a pretty good imagination to think about it as it was when the original habitants occupied it (but then you probably wouldn't have visited it then).

It's a Disneyland type version of what 'old' Singapore was like. OK buildings and riverside location are original but other than that it's a series of over-priced, poor quality restaurants and ghastly 'British' pubs frequented by just as ghastly ex-pats. If you feel out of place away from home and have a bit of cash to spare then Boat Quay (and Clarke Quay just up the road) is the place to head. If you want to come back with any sort of understanding of what the real Singapore is like then give it a miss."
,,Was great,3.0,,"Unless you're an expat and you got poor sense of costs and currency exchange and you love touts because they make you special, then this is the place to be. Otherwise follow the river footpath up north to Clarke Quay instead."
,,A place for pub hopping and create your network,4.0,,"One of the active night out places in singapore, crowd here is mid age
this is close to business district in singapore, you will find mostly bankers and white expats at this place.

there is number of pubs and good resturants beside river, this is good place to meet new people and have your after office business conversation.

there are quite lot of indian dance bar and pubs at near by places."
,,A Place to Eat ?,3.0,,"Boat quay as you would expect is situated along the river, and is between Clarke Quay and the Marina Bay Area.

Every inch is crammed with restaurants, with everyone desperate to win your trade, and some quite pushy in their efforts to get you into their establishments. We didn't eat here, as thought most were quite expensive, although did enjoy seeing the live fish etc in the tanks outside. If I wasn't already a vegetarian, I think that would have made me become one !

For those on a budget try the food courts in the shopping malls spread along the river, or McDonalds, for a much cheaper alternative."
,,A Quay to Enjoyment,5.0,,"I'm from JB in Malaysia, meaning Singapore is pretty much my backyard. This is one of my favourite places to visit. A blend of modern and classic scenery and architecture, no shortage of food outlets and if you're up for it, you can take a cruise along the Singapore River from Clarke Quay. Wonderful way to spend an evening in Singapore. It can get very crowded at nights, so if you're not a fan of crowds I'd suggest to go in the evenings and grab dinner elsewhere. It'd be worse on the weekends, but if this is your scene, go for it and have a helluva time!"
,,Good old Singapore architecture,4.0,,The old traders houses are well preserved- it's refreshing after so many skyscrapers. The open air terraces/restaurants offer fresh sea food at reasonable prices. A nice feeling of the past.
,,Midnight delight,4.0,,"If you're new around the area, this is the place the office people go when they knock off work. See the tall buildings around the area? They work there! Mostly filled with adults who can hold their liqour, so not a good place to find drunkards. You need to go to Zouk past 2am for that!"
,,NEVER ORDER SEAFOOD AT ANY RESTAURANT. BE CAREFUL.,4.0,,"So many restaurants and bars and boat quay will make you feel you are away from home. Lovely alfresco dining along the river.

One thing to remember. Please avoid to go to any seafood restaurants, especially market priced seafood. You will be fainted when your bill came to your table. The taste is horrible and it will be more expensive than other nice seafood restaurant like Jumbo, Palm Beach and so on.

If you still wanna go, please be careful."
,,Atmosphere,4.0,,"This is a lovely place to dine especially at night with all the lights shining on the river, lots of variety too."
,,So much choice,4.0,,"What a unique strip where you can make a last minute decision on what to eat, drink and the best place to hang out"
,,Seafood Center of the Quays,3.0,,Boat Quay was the hotspot 15 years ago and had a lot of variety. Today it is still good for seafood but not the variety it had in the past. Prefer Clarke and Robinson Quay now.
,,Entertainment and Dining Experience,4.0,,"A slightly lower cost version of Clarke Quay. So much variety of bars and restaurants, but still retaining the 'back street' feel about it. The beer was cold and the food great"
,,Fun!,4.0,,"Higher prices than at local places as Boat Quay is pretty well stocked with ex-pats and holiday makers but for a fun, vibrant atmosphere prefer Boat Quay to Clarke Quay ( which is a bit more mainstream). Some great places on Boat Quay - Dallas Bar, Red Dot and 77 Winebar as well as tons of seafood restaurants. Be careful not to get cornered by waiters trying to fill their tables though."
,,So many great restaurants!,4.0,,This place is packed full of restaurants! You'll be able to find probably any food you desire. Everything is very close to you can walk around until you find a place that tickles your fancy.
,,A must see scenery!,5.0,,"There are Parliament House, United Overseas Bank Plaza1 &2, a lot of restaurants and bars. You may visit this area by walking or Singapore River Cruise."
,,Spoilt by pushy restaurant staff!,2.0,,"I had read previous reviews about Boat Quay so at least I was a bit prepared for the pushy restaurant staff who won't let you even look at menus outside without pestering, even so it completely ruined my last evening in Singapore. In hindsight we should have gone down earlier in the evening before the hunger had set in and then we might have been a bit more able to say no, just looking, and find somewhere that was nice. The prices did seem expensive here and the restaurant that we ate in (Cantonese I think) charged us for the towel wipes!! I heard the guy on the table behind also comment about this ridiculous charge. So not an enjoyable experience for us and wish we'd gone to Clarke Quay instead where we would recommend. I don't think I've ever scored anything as poor before."
,,Inflated tourist prices,2.0,,"This is a cardboard cutout version of the authentic streetlife of other cities, with inflated tourist prices. Go to Lau Pa Sat for cheaper better quality food, and to Geylang or Arab Street for better streetlife."
,,Could be lovely but ..,3.0,,".. the atmosphere walking along is ruined by aggressive touts and service in many places leaves a lot to be desired e.g. pushing you for another beer when you're only halfway through one, refusing a simple request for change to split bill with. Nasty. One high point: Smiths Fish and Chips are authentic and tasty."
,,Seafood and Bars,4.0,,"Went there for the stingray. Try to eat it at one of the chinese eateries instead of the ones by the river. IMO, more spicy, more delicious - perfect with a bottle of beer. Cheaper too."
,,Expat and tourist,4.0,,"Somel locals but the many bars and eating places tend to cater to tourists and the expat community. Some very good food in there, higher prices than elsewhere in Singapore for same far. Nice to be by the River."
,,"Beautiful at night, great atmosphere.",4.0,,"Boat Quay is a great place to go, have a drink and watch the lights of downtown Singapore sparkle at night. Food tends to be a bit on the pricey-side at the riverside restaurants although there is always Harry's for fish and chips and 'Our Village' for a really good Indian is very pleasant. The Prince of Wales is a nice little place to hang out for live bands."
,,Singapore GP,5.0,,"Great mixture of lively bars and restaurants, both sides of the river. Something for everyone and very mixed groups."
,,Was pretty to see,4.0,,Was very nice to see if you have extra time or want to do some walking around. It is mixed with old culture and very westernized culture (Materialistic stuff). Water looks nasty though lol.
,,Many restaurant staff standing outside to bait potential customers,3.0,,"You can't walk along this part of the river at night without being ""greeted"" by numerous staff hawking their menu. The more appropriate word to use here is ""hounded"" perhaps, especially if you are in a big group, because that's what the restaurants are looking out for - to get big groups in & make the hell lotsa money. Their main clientele in the daytime is office workers & come night-time, it is tourists.

There will be the occasional big 'Live' Sri Lankan crab with one of its pincers tied to a pillar on the ground to entice potential customers to walk in & try their Sri Lanka crab.

Conclusion: Don't dine here as it is really expensive."
,,"Best place for pubs, chillax",5.0,,"River is very clean, shop houses are all brilliantly decorated. A lot of pubs and clubs along the riverside. come at night to experience all the vibrant life."
,,Iconic part of Singapore,4.0,,"I prefer Boat Quay to Clark Quay - very close, and definitely worth any extra walk. Really comes alive as the sun sets - some good places to grab a beer at happy hour. Plenty of choice for places to eat."
,,SET LUNCH SPECIAL,5.0,,"Hard to go wrong here. I work nearby and come here at least once a week for lunch. One tip - ask the restaurant if they do set lunches. If not, keep walking. Many dont advertise because they are considerably less expensive than the a la carte menu. For around $10 per person, expect to get 2-3 dishes plus unlimited rice (and naan at the Indian places) plus unlimimted drinks."
,,Good safe clean fun,5.0,,"Lots of bars and restaurant, great vibe, safe and pleasant. Perfect for after work drinks; only problem is it shuts down around 10PM. Eat at Punjab Da Daba rooftop restaurant - its awesome."
,,What a dissappointment,2.0,,"I thought that this would be a great place to enjoy some fresh seafood. And I had this picturesque area pictured in my head. And of course I was disappointed mostly because of the aggressive touts and all the neon signs.

It was quite annoying and disappointing experience since I would like to stroll down the street and just read the menu first then look at the seating and ambience of a restaurant and then decide if I want to eat there. It is impossible here in this area. Just to escape other aggressive touts we ended up in one of the restaurants without reading the menu first and of course it did not have all I had in mind. However we had a nice table just by the water and the food was after all ok.

I do not remember which restaurant but I will probably not go here again because you can get good food all over Singapore and this was very stressful place for me. If you are not annoyed by the aggressive touts and neon lights and look for fresh seafood, maybe this is good for you."
,,Restaurants and bars,4.0,,"A long line of restaurants and bars alongside the Singapore River, with an broad choice of cuisines. Some dodgy bars as well."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"I recently returned to Boat Quay, having first visited a few years back (when I enjoyed it). The return visit should have been great - a lovely setting by the river, a warm balmy night, the prospect of good food for dinner. Instead we had a really bad experience - due to a misleading menu, we were charged S$112 for four dried up prawns! Our modest dinner for two came to almost S$300, the food was below average and the service was terrible. The restaurant in question was the FuQing Marina Bay Seafood Restaurant LLP (45 and 46 Boat Quay) - suggest that it be avoided like the plague. Along the rest of Boat Quay, there was a lot of aggressive touting, and the area seemed far more run down than I remembered from my previous visit. I'd suggest visitors try the hawker food markets at Newton Circus or Lau Pa Sat instead - where you'll pay a fraction of the Boat Quay price for better food and more atmosphere (albeit without tablecloths!). All Boat Quay has going for it these days is the riverside location. It's all rather sad. The Singapore Tourist Board needs to clean the place up!"
,,A good place to wind down after work.,4.0,,"Good place to booze with friends by the riverside, albeit river can be polluted at times. Can be crowded during Fridays and Saturdays."
,,Drinks and Food Galore,4.0,,Vibrant and Bustling. Good food and drink- good in Evenings and weekends.
,,Some nice restaurants and pubs but...,3.0,,"boat Quay has some nice restaurants and pubs but so many other areas have come up that it has lost a little of its buzz. Best on a Thursday or Friday evening when the hungry and thirsty workers of Raffles Place descend on it for some we;; deserved refreshments.
Harry's bar does a nice lunch."
,,Fun place to dine and bar hop,5.0,,Really fun for young adults who are looking to get out and have a good time.
,,Very touristy and a little tacky,3.0,,Very touristy and ruined by tacky neon signs and aggressive touts. Go to Clarke Quay just across the river instead.
,,Love it...,5.0,,"A nice place to walk. Love to take photos here. Raffles landing site, Fullerton Hotel, tall business building, Singapore river...everything just blend well for an awesome and picturesque scene. Not necessarily you visit the restaurants, bars or pubs. Just hang around there is great enough. I guess the night view must be charming too."
,,"Great selection of shops, bars and restraunts",4.0,,"It's a nice place to walk and there are many bars, restaurants and shopping options in the area. A great place for lunch or an evening out"
,,Seafood at its best,5.0,,"Boat Quay is lined with restaurants & pubs. They have the best & freshest sea food available, & by fresh I mean fresh. You can choose what you want from tanks displayed outside & take a seat while they prepare it. The Chili Crabs are great & the Indian food is good too."
,,Tourist?,2.0,,"If you are go here and resist the urge to be pulled into the first place, stay cool and make sure you choose a place where there is already a crown and where you pre-agree the price of your ""excellent seafood platter"". Some resturants here are REALLY good and friendly, others not so."
,,menu in the face time,5.0,,"Ok its a bit more under control but the evenings highlight was trying to pass a certain restaurant without being physically manhandled, your path obstructed of the favorite menu in the face technique - you gotta love the business style. Restaurants are pretty average and vastly overpriced for Singapore but a few good pubs with a corking view make it the best wee place in town."
,,"Great buzz, not necessarily great food",4.0,,"Boat Quay is a standard destination when we have guests visiting us in Singapore, as you cannot beat its location against the river. It has a large collection of bars and riverside restaurants which are great for a night out. I wouldnt rate the food very highly though its not bad at all."
,,Options For Everyone,4.0,,"A night time walk along Boat Quay is arguably a must for any Singapore visit. Myself, I'm here almost every day. There are bars, restaurants and a few other establishments catering for all tastes. Although a little pricy targetted at the tourist, you wont go wrong with any of the good quality Chinese Seafood, Indian or Japanese restaurants."
,,Great at night,4.0,,"This place is nothing much during the day. At night, however, it turns into a fun place to hang out with lots of bars and restaurants. A lot of expats go here to drink and, hence, the prices leans towards being more expensive. Even if you're not up for drinking, hanging out here is nice at night as the buildings and lights reflect on the water. Great place to visit."
,,Great selection of places to eat,5.0,,"One of the places where I go when I am in Singapore is Boat Quay. There is a lot of various types of food places and pubs to choose from.
The one thing that is a slight turn-off is that there are a lot of the establishments that have people out there to try and get you to eat at there place, and almost badger you too much.
All-in-all, it is a good place to find what you are hungry for."
,,Nice riverside view,3.0,,Good riverside view and a lot of food and drink places. Can get quite crowded at night.
,,Nice Area - not as touristy as Clarke Quay,4.0,,There is a nice selection of restaurants along the water and at the bases of the buildings lining the canal at Boat Quay. Definitely worth a walk at night to see the full selection. Different to Clarke Quay....
,,Seedy place,3.0,,"SHould have been good - 2 streets including one with riverview of restaurants, pubs, bars, night spots etc. But maybe the type of establishments it attracts or the frequent rate of change of the places, this place remains rather touristy and seedy with tons of touts nearly pulling you into their restaurant/bar, etc. Previously there were alot of fights emanating from rowdy people who go there for the cheap drinks but understand its much better now with the police stepping up their surveillance of the place. Go to Clarke Quay across the river instead - the ambience is better with better variety of restaurants and night spots of a better class."
,,Take A Walk and Soak It Up,4.0,,"After a long flight, I checked into my hostel and met up with my friend. This is where she first took me, a walk around Boat Quay. It was quite relaxing, and she was telling me all about the place, answering my questions as I see this or that. This is a good place to unwind in the late afternoon. Later that night, after catching a run of WICKED at Marina Bay, we came back here for supper and the place was HOPPING! Totally unlike what it looks like during the day, but very interesting nonetheless.

I think the best way to spend a walk around Boat Quay is to do it with a local. Oh the wealth of info and knowledge you'd get!!"
,,Great place to chill,4.0,,There are so many shops and dine in places! Basically you're spoilt for choice. It feels good even just to walk around.
,,Touristy,3.0,,Just a row of historical shophouses converted into eateries. Easy to get to by train. Food's so-so.
,,Still the place to go for Friday night drink after work,4.0,,"Not quite the same buzz that it had 10 years ago, but still the place to go for drinks on a Friday after work. Some of the good restaurants are still there (Our Village) but alot of them have moved over the years. Still can't beat a drink at Harry's or Penny Black to end the week."
,,Lovely & lively place!,5.0,,"You have to check this place out when in Singapore. Really cool place to hang out with friends & just enjoy the breeze as you relax by the river. Was once part of the Singapore port back in the old days, but now these row of old shops have been restored beautifully. The night scene here is awesome."
,,not spectacular but a good place to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Nice place to walk around and sit down for meal or refreshment. I think it is typical Singapore..nice, clean, industralized but not much of character. Outdoor dining is fun but the chicken satay at one of the restaurants (forgot the name as I was dragged there by friends) is horrible....dried and tasteless."
,,Long walk or great food,4.0,,Enjoy an nice evening walk along the river an stop an heave a nice meal
,,Beautiful Lavish Lit Skyline,5.0,,We sailed into Singapore to see these skyscrapers alit for our first time. We have returned several times as it stuns the imagination how well planned Singapore's architecture is
,,Not as snooty as Clarke Quay,4.0,,"A huge variety of restaurants, a good view, and it's less noisy and raucous than Clarke Quay. Still expensive but that's to be expected."
,,Top tourist spot,4.0,,"U get lots of restaurant, bars and clubs.. Weekdays its kinda dead. U should visit during Friday, Saturday and Sunday (quiet down, for chilling out only)"
,,"Terrific Views, restarurants",4.0,,Singapore's well known hangout. Teh food here is amazing and the views are pretty too.
,,Still old and nothing done,3.0,,"When walking along Boat Quay, you'll feel like you are at Bangkok with Stalls owners asking you to patronise them..."
,,Spectacular Night View,4.0,,Got a long strip of bars with giant alaskan crabs and other seafood on display. A place where a lot of expats hang out. Great view of the river especially during full moon.
,,"A more relaxed, slightly less expensive alternative to Clarke Quay",4.0,,"Boat Quay is a quick walk under along the water and under the bridge away from Clarke Quay. It has many good restaurants which have patio seating which overlooks the river . The feeling is a little less party and a little more intimate than Clarke Quay. There is less flash and loud music, but it's by no means boring.

Restaurants are located ""inland"" and are separated by a pedestrian walkway from their individual waterside outdoor eating areas. Look out for servers crossing with trays of food and drinks, and don't be intimidated by the hosts and hostesses who encourage you to choose their restaurant. Review the menus as you stroll through, and check out the big tanks displaying fresh, live seafood."
,,Lost its old colors,1.0,,"Supposedly the economical golden zone of the island-state in the olden days, it is now flanked by pubs and clubs with rowdy crowd and restaurants touting tourists to eat in. Surprisingly how they could tell the difference between a local and a foreigner when you walk on by. Standing there,you will never notice the once vibrant and colorful area and the beauty of the colonial buildings shaded by the tiger beer and heineken umbrellas."
,,Tourist Trap,3.0,,Visit only if you like people crowding you and hawking their restaurants... super touristy place. Lots of sleazy drunken men prepositioning any Asian girl in a skirt. Clarke Quay is the better of the two.
,,Seedy and over-priced seafood in a nice location,3.0,,"Boat Quay enjors a lovely location along the Singapore River and has a wide array of restaurants and nightclubs along its back alleys. The clubs have a decidedly seedy feel with touts outside. Similarly, there are many restaurants along the riverfront but you hav to be careful to ask the prices as the seafood and fish vendors will try to steer you to their ridiculously over-priced items. It is a lovely place to stroll in the evening but I'd eat elsewhere."
,,Over done!!,2.0,,"In your face commercial SIngapore at its worst. ""You want seafood?"", ""You want this?"", ""You want that?"". NO LEAVE ME ALONE. Oh and expensive lag!"
,,"A nice, but not so quiet walk; for dinner it is a magic spot",4.0,,"It is a nice walk along Boat Quay, between South Bridge Road and the Fullerton Hotel. The route begins at South Bridge Road and leads along shop houses, converted to restaurants, with their outside terraces along the Singapore River. After that you walk ""in the shadow"" of the huge bank offices rising up to 200 meters into the air and arrive at the historic building, housing the Fullerton Hotel. Definitively to be recommended to the first time visitor to Singapore. What makes the walk not so quiet is, that each restaurant on Boat Quay along the Singapore river employs a ""barker"" who will try to attract your attention, forces the menu on you and even follows you for some time with urgent request to dine at that particular restaurant. One or two times is amusing, but twenty times in a row? (I must add, that at my last visit there seemed to be adopted some sort of self regulation to rein in the ""barking"" a bit.) However, this part of review is about walking along Boat Quay. The picture improves, when you elect to have dinner in the evening at one of the restaurants. (Also refer to my review of ""Lanna Thai Restaurant"" on Boat Quay). When you sit at your table, looking over the Singapore river, and the dusk sets in, the bumboats with with their illuminated Chinese lanterns are chugging by and the huge office buildings are looking down on you, then you have dinner at a magic spot. When electing a restaurant, ask for discounts in advance. There is always some sort of happy hour going on (two drinks for one) and a serious discount on the food is almost always possible."
,,Subtle(r),5.0,,"I like Boat Quay more than Clarke Quay... it is more subtle, and is not over-flowing with people... one can sit much closer to the river and the views are pretty."
,,Outdated and pushy,2.0,,"Boat Quay is very 70's looking. The plastic barriers and large umbrellas they've installed are revolting and really spoil the facades of the shop houses and go-down's. It is need of a good overhaul with sympathetic renovations. If you decide to come here for a meal or to simply walk along the river be prepared to be touted at every cafe, bar and restaurant."
,,not the best,3.0,,Boat Quay is cheaper than Clark Quay but is definitely seedier.
,,Fantastic night view,5.0,,Night skyline is fantastic. Plenty of places to eat and very nice to walk
,,Nice walk along river,4.0,,Good both day and night to see the Singapore River and surrounding buildings. Lots of nice restaurants- the only thing is you can't walk along at night without being asked all the time about wanting to eat. Not a problem most of the tine but a bit frustrating if you just want a walk! But the views are worth it.
,,good food in nice atmosphere,4.0,,"this is the place for enjoy better singaporean cuisine. i try singaporean crab dish, they use a giant Srilangkan crabs. the meat is sweet and tender combine with the chili and the savory gravy just perfect to enjoy the night in Boat Quay. they offer cruising singaporean most clean river here also. i havent try it since the food is tempted me more :)"
,,Annoying touts abound,3.0,,You can't walk down Boat Quay without getting hassled by people trying to get you into their restaurants. I read in the newspaper recently that some of the restaurants that don't do this were trying to stop the others doing it. Hopefully this will happen because it would be a nicer place to walk if they did. One night we walked down there and counted how many times we got hassled - total was 18.
,,A place to dine at night,5.0,,Many pubs and restaurants.. a place where you can relax by the river and dine. Could be quite pricey though.
,,Boat Quay - chilling with the river experience,4.0,,"as it along the side of Singapore River it has great atomsphere with whole stretch of bars, pubs and restaurants its a awesome place to be after work!"
,,Tourist trap,1.0,,"Food atrociously overpriced. Pubs are ok, but ask around, there are much better options not that far away (Clarke Quay especially)"
,,Nice Wale,3.0,,"Didn't appreciate having to face a greeting staff member, from each and every restaurant, who were inviting me to dine at their facilities."
,,Excellent food - even on 2nd visit!,4.0,,We first visited boat quay on our honeymoon in summer 2009. Whilst Singapore nightlife has changed massively since then we were pleased to find that the food was still as good as when we first came here!
,,"Worth a stroll for the atmosphere, views and adjacent attractions",4.0,,"The Boat Quay is easily accessible.

You can get there on the MRT (Raffles Place station).

There's a strip with a range of bars and restaurants of variable interest- I suggest you walk along there for the atmosphere.

It's near to the Asian Civilisations Museum (which is a short stroll across a bridge), and not far from Clarke Quay, which offers generally somewhat more upmarket dining opportunities.

Nonetheless, it's an interesting place for a stroll if you're in the area."
,,Not impressed,2.0,,"Very touristy with every restaurant grouping at you to sit in their table by the river. All had ""deals"" and we got very tired of the constant hawking. When we finally chose a place, they sat us and then it seems we were no longer ""important"". Marginal service and the ""free Singapore Slings"" were pretty weak if not virgin. Food so-so and the price too high for the quality. Granted this is only one restaurant among a lot to choose from, but the atmosphere tells me it is all mostly that way. And I make this observation after going to Clarke Quay the next night and having a wonderful meal in a dignified atmosphere."
,,Boat Quay seems to left behind in a city fast growing and progressing,2.0,,"We have nice memories of Boat Quay from not that long ago. However, we got the feeling during our trip this past weekend that it was being left behind while the rest of Singapore progressed into a great world destination, at least in the area between Marina Bay and Clark Quay.

We didn't eat here this trip but walked through a couple times. The restaurant touts seem much more aggressive than in the past. There seem too many restaurants now and too few people stopping here, probably the result of Clark Quay taking too much market share these days.

Based on our most recent visit, it seems Boat Quay is falling into the tourist trap category and not worthy of spending time. Instead, we'd recommend visiting Clark Quay and Marina Bay area now.

Lets hope this area gets the attention of city planners so that it doesn't become dilapidated. It really does need to be a part of the Orchard, Quay to Marina Bay connection of city sights."
,,Fuqing Marina Bay Seafood,4.0,,"Yes, the hassle of ALL the places at Boat Quay are overwhelming and daunting to say the least. I am one who absolutely HATES it. But my family and I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times since living in Singapore. Once mgmt. found out we were locals, they dropped the prices and gave us a business card which allows us 20% off any meal we eat there. Which yes, still is expensive, but I don't know any place to eat in Singapore other than they Hawker stalls that isn't ridiculously expensive. The staff is always very friendly (which isn't always the case when it comes to ex-pats trying to get good service in a local place) and the food, in my family's opinion, is very good."
,,Avoid Fuqing restaurant Boatquay,1.0,,As a previous reviewer has suggested Boat quay is probably not the best place to eat well but the location remains good. It is incredibly difficult to choose a restaurant given the hassle you will get but whatever you do avoid the Fuqing Marina Bay Seafood Restaurant if you can. The food was served cold and when we complained they basically shrugged their shoulders.. When we asked for the manager he condescendingly took half the price off a barely touched fish dish and suggested to us that that was a big concession on what was an already overpriced poor meal. It really gave the impression that the restaurant was dependent on one time visitors and that regulars would prob not touch it with a bargepole!
,,Nice food but make sure you browse,4.0,,"The last couple of reviews of this place have been a bit apocalyptic compared to my experiences there. This is indeed a place where every restaurant employs people to try and persuade you to come in but if you simply say you want to look at all the restaurants first they will accept this with no hassle and give you a business card to remind you which place they are.

The experience of being asked to come into a restaurant 100 times as you walk down the quay may be a bit daunting for some people but I didn't find it any problem. I've been to places in Africa that were a LOT worse and wouldn't take no for an answer but in Singapore they are very polite people and if you want to look around first they will accept this.

If you want to look around without being hassled then go before lunchtime and you will get a chance to look around with none of the staff trying to get you in there.

Having said that the food there is very good and I enjoyed eating there. You can get everything from Malay food to English to French to Italian to Thai to everything like snacks, burgers, steaks. Basically if you want it you can find it here. It's a little cheaper than at Clarke Quay but has some good views if you don't mind the people trying to persuade you into every restaurant.

If you just want to see the Quay without eating there then walk down the east bank of the river (the side with the Raffles statue). You can see Boat Quay and take some good photos but you won't get a chance to sample the food."
,,Ugh - aggressive hassling ruins the experience.,1.0,,"Walked between Clarke and Boat Quays and Boat Quay in its day might have been a quaint fun place to eat overlooking the river. However, the presence of being hassled and stopped by every shop like you were traveling to a 3rd world country ruins the whole experience. Of the occupied tables (albeit, it was a drizzly evening) I noticed there didn't appear to be any locals (or very few) and what tables were occupied were very obviously tourists.

It's a shame that the hassling ruins what might have been a great location to eat. In contrast. Clarke Quay seems to attract a more local clientele and more upscale restaurants.

My advice: forget Boat Quay - it'll just raise your blood pressure and go walk around and choose a spot on Clarke Quay."
,,"Hassled, Hassled, Hassled. Forget Boat Quay and go to Clarke Quay.",1.0,,Unfortunately it is impossible to walk along Boat Quay and look at the menus and decide where you would like to eat. The restaurants workers hassle you so much to come in to there restaurant that it makes the whole experience horrible. Clarke Quay on the other hand does not have this problem and is a very pleasureable place to dine out.
,,Nice Area - Take a bumboat ride,4.0,,"Nice area to walk around, has been well restored. Lots of restaurants along the water to stop in, particularly if it's a nice day. Take a bumboat tour of the harbor - it's a great way to see the city. They use a recorded narration. You go underneath the bridges. Well worth it."
