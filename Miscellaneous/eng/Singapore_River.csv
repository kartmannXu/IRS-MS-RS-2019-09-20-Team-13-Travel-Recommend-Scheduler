,,The quay area is getting seedy and overpricef,3.0,,Many restaurants are selling poor over priced food and although convenient that's very disappointing.Good views aren't enough it's Singapore.I expect food better than home.In four days there wasn't one restaurant Id recommend for breakfast or dinner in this area.
,,S'pore river,5.0,,I love the memories of Singapore River. In poly days I used to go here to check out the scenery. I like the ambience. One can even bring a book or novel to read or write in this place.
,,Evening Walk along Singapore River,5.0,,"Excellent setting and build up. With breezy air, it form an excellent walk for us last evening. Great place for both Singaporean and foreigners actually. But do be careful of people on E-scoters....Can be dangerous. Government ought to do some setting around this aspect."
,,Quays By the Singapore River,5.0,,"No where in the world will one find 3 quays linkage by the river. From Robertson quay to Clarke quay to Boat quay. F&B, Pubs, Retail outlets and etc. lining on both sides of the river. Not to be missed!"
,,Spectacular area to stay for young adults,5.0,,"I am a solo female traveller and I stayed in a hotel about 5 minutes walk from Clarke Quay. I LOVED this area - and if/when I return to Singapore I will stay here again. The restaurants are exceptional and range from every price and cuisine. The nightlife is spectacular, for the chill patio beer and also for the high energy club. It's a beautiful walk through the area, I did it at all hours of the day for a week straight as I walked from my hotel to subway stations. There is a conveniently close mall for whatever you need. Robertson Quay has a cute center with beautiful architecture and lights - I went to a late night spa there and had a really great / much needed foot massage before walking back to Clarke Quay and eating gnocchi on the waterfront with a glass of wine."
,,Night river cruise,5.0,,We did the night river cruise which includes the light show in front of Marina Bay [ boat stops/cruises] for show. Some may consider this a bit expensive but we thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the city and river lights

,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,We took a boat cruise from Clarke Quay at night and the lights of all the buildings and bridges were beautifull and we took way too many photos. This cruise took us into Marina Bay area so we could watch the laser light and water show in front of the Marina bay Sands Hotel. Two shows per night and a really different way to experience this event from the water and so close to all the action
,,The best way to enjoy the River...,5.0,,But go in the evening to see everything at its best. Be prepared for huge crowds too though the boats are frequent! Fabulous light shows across the bridges and hotels.

You will see the historic district, former warehouses and a lot of restaurants and bars along Clak Quay and the Riverwalk. The latter is more peaceful and romantic.

Great place for a nightcap,"
,,A river cruise is the best way to see all the sights!,5.0,,"We took the MRT to Clarke Quay, and then bought a river cruise leaving just before dark. The bridges, buildings and sights are all illuminated and just stunning. If you are short on time, this is a fantastic way to see the skyline, Merlion, Marina Sands hotel and the Singapore Flyer in less than an hour. We thoroughly enjoyed this that our fantastic taxi driver recommended."
,,A beautiful Vista,5.0,,"We were staying away from the rover (a small mistake on ur part) but a walk along the banks was great. There is plenty of food, shopping and reaonsably well priced cruises....well worth a look."
,,Great place to eat and drink.,4.0,,A lovely river in the centre of Singapore. We were staying at Clarke quay and were a couple of mins walk from the river. The river is clean and if you are lucky you may see otters swimming .It is worth going on a river boat trip. These last about 45 mins and we took one in the evening.

,,cleanest river I have seen,5.0,,I thought the Russian River in wine country was clean but its a small stream. The Singapore River is clean and lots of stuff to do. They take pride in presentation so there were barges and people cleaning an already clean river each day. Wow.

The night in the riverside is amazing, we can see the Fullerton hotel and the Merlion. Singapore is so beautiful, feel all the people are enjoying their life, I am so envy."
,,A Friday Night Place to be seen.,4.0,,"There is a number of bars along the river that is already open at noon time serving most known alcohol, spirits, wine and mixed concoctions. The list of the Bar Chow that are being offered to patrons is very extensive and can be indulged in as long as one can afford the prices listed on the menu. By sunset, a cacophony of sounds blared as darkness covers the skyline of Singapore and will be later illuminated by different lights and lasers flickering to the beat of different sounds played by different djs of the establishments along the river. This should be included in every one's itinerary in Singapore."
,,Good to experience,3.0,,It took about 30 minutes to cruise from 1 end to the other. Passing thru restaurants alongside the river. Enjoying all the skyscrapers view. That's all you do.

,,A must do for all tourists,5.0,,Singapore river cruises has been in operation since 1987 and is one of the worlds first eco friendly rides. The cruise itself is about 30 to 40ish mins and it takes you through the singapore river. Best visited during the afternoon. Its a full on history lesson. You will get to know how the merlion came into exsistance and how the sleepy little fishing village became a world renowned icon. A traquil and mesmerizing adventure. Would highly recommend this to everyone.
,,clean and safe...just great,5.0,,"a great place to explore, very clean and safe. it transforms into a kaleidoscope of colours at a night with lots to see do and eat...yum"
,,Great trip around the waterways,4.0,,Using electric boats to reduce pollution in the drinking water (because it's the country's reservoir no less!) we glided through the water and had all the focal points showed to us along the way. Nice trip and very smooth both onboard and the whole operation. Well worth it

Great views of the bridges, architecture & some sculptures which the boatman was only too willing to ensure you got the best shots."
,,Great walk!,5.0,,"Take your time, all three quays are worth walking. Robertson Quay has higher end restaurants. Clark Quay and Boat Quay have the boat tours. Lots of variety in restaurants and competition with happy hours. They are beautiful at night with all the lights."
,,Loved the vibrant night seen at Boat Quay,5.0,,"A short Grab ride from our hotel on Middle Rd, we had dinner along Boat Quay. There are many restaurants to choose from including Italian, Mexican, Singaporean and Western cuisines.

We had a view of the Fullerton Hotel in the distance with the river in the foreground."
,,Cruise Down Singapore River!,5.0,,Excellent journey to be mesmerize by the beautiful skyline under s starey night or a cosy cool rider after a romantic dinner!
,,Ideal,4.0,,"A great way to view Singapore from the river. Nothing better on a hot day than to either float on the river , or view it from the quays. A recorded information tape is played on the boat to acquaint you with the history of the river and how it has been part of the countries success."
,,An ideal way to see the centre of the city,5.0,,"Take a short river cruise to see the centre of the city. Embarking near the Merlion, the cruise typically takes you on a short harbour tour where you can see the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands close up. You can also see the unique lotus shaped ArtScience Museum and the Singapore Flyer across the Helix Bridge.This is also an ideal time to look back and take photos of the Merlion statue from a distance. Coming around before you enter the river, you can see buildings shaped like local durian fruit, which are actually the spectacular Esplande - Theatres on the Bay. As you proceed under the Esplanade and Anderson bridges, you get to see other historic sights on the north side of the river including Raffles Landing Site, and McDonald's Boat Quay on the south. The Boat Quay is home to a lively night scene with numerous restaurants and pubs right on the waterfront. Proceeding along the river, you will pass Clarke Quay, and other historic bridges and and sites. It's an absolutely lovely way to spend an hour or so. If you take the cruise in the evening, you may see some of the sound, light and fountain shows in front of Raffles Landing Site or at Spectra - A Light and Water Show in front of the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Afterwards, you can spend some time at the Merlion, wandering around the harbour, or having a cool drink at McDonald's Boat Quay. Perfect!"
,,Enjoyable Walk,5.0,,"We walked from our hotel on Orchard Road and joined the river walk at River Valley Green. We continued down the river past Robertson Quay, Clarke Quay, the Grand Prix grand stand and across the walking bridge to the Marina Sands Shopping Mall.
There are plenty of restaurants and bars to take a break during the walk.
The river walk also is great for taking photos of some of Singapore’s iconic buildings & bridges.
The walk is very safe and is kept spotless clean."

,,Nice walk,4.0,,"Great walk along river, we walked from Robertson’s Quay to Marina Square and Raffles City and lots of places to see on the way. One thing that is a growing problem is the many fast electric scooters and dog walkers, Singapore’s last eat accessory!!!"
,,Interesting history,4.0,,"The quite short river was a key to Singapores development. The outer barrage means it's not now really a river but a reservoir. The old Clark Quay and nearby Boat Quay remain, now mainly restaurants. Trade is now done in the massive container etc ports beyond the barrage. The river tours are quite short but the commentaries give a good historic overview. Many of Singapores sights are visible from the river and 'marina bay' (also not really a marina at all).
Join from Clark quay or any number of intermediate stops, shown on maps."
,,Great walks,4.0,,Lovely walks alongside the river and great views of the river and the incredible skyline as you walk round. Several boat trips on offer too!
,,Enjoyable place,5.0,,You can go to Clark Quay to enjoy both the most traveller-busy street and the Singapore riverside with adventurous game - kind of bungee. And take a shot with the MCI Building instagramable scene.
,,Day or Night a Beautiful Place to Visit & Explore,5.0,,"I personally recommend touring the Singapore River on one of the several river boat cruise lines. There is so much to see of history along the river with many old restored buildings, highrises, historic government buildings, hotels and beautiful old bridges along the river banks. At night the Singapore river really comes to life with vibrant lights, restaurants, lighted buildings, etc. LOVED IT!

BOTTOM LINE: I recommend the Singapore River a MUST SEE when visiting here. I have done this three times now over the years and each time I have see something new. Nighttime is my favorite time to be on the river. AMAZING! MY RATING: 10/10."

,,Stands out at night!,5.0,,"A Bum Boat trip around a part of the river( which is a reservoir for cities water supply) is a must the trip last's for around 40 minutes and costs $25 per adult we did it twice, once in the morning, and the other time was on a night tour of the city"
,,A lovely walk and beautiful skyline,5.0,,"I started the walk from riverside point. As I walked towards Fullerton hotel, the views were more and more beautiful. Tons of restaurants and bars can be found at Clark Quay. The lightening and music bring vibrant atmosphere to this area. After Clark Quay, on the other side of the river is a row of small, cute and old houses which have turned into all kinds of restaurants welcoming people to enjoy the fantastic skyline with delicious food. From time to time, the river cruise boats with neon lights would glide through and make the river more romantic."
,,beautiful skyline,5.0,,"the cleanest city anywhere and a beautiful skyline with shinny skyscrapers one after another. The 8 pm show on the river at Marina Bay Resort is a wonderful laser, light, water & music spectacular event which is a no miss event."

,,Nice riverfront walk,4.0,,"The Singapore River is a small river, maybe 5km, but the city has developed walkways the length of the river which make for a good walk, with many restaurants, museums and bars along the way.
Also have boat tours on the river, which stop at the Flyover and other places.
Boat Quay, Clark Quay have a good number of decent restaurants to enjoy a drink or meal along the riverfront."
,,River Trip from Clarke's Quay,5.0,,After doing the Flyer go on a River Trip from Clarke's Quay. It gives you a different perspective and you get great views of the old and the new architecture of Singapore. Well worth doing.
,,A magic spot after sunset.,4.0,,"The best time to visit is in the evening, when the sun has set and the tall office buildings of the business district loom over Boat Quay and the illuminated Sampam boats glide over the water, not chugging anymore, because I suspect they all have electric propulsion now. Choose from the options of a walk along Boat Quay or Clark Quay, settle down at an outdoor table at the river of a cafe or restaurant, or book a tour on a Sampam boat. Singapore river is enchanting."
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,We loved that we stayed in this area. Do nice for a walk. Do many nice restaurants along the river offering a wonderful evening view.
,,GREAT TO VISIT DAY AND THEN AT NIGHT.,5.0,,"JUST GREAT TO VIEW DURING THE DAY, BUT WOW DOESNT THIS AREA COME TO LIFE AT NIGHT.
During the day we walked around sightseeing and took the day river cruise.
There is so much to see and one has to visit the Merlion water spout.
Cross between lion and mermaid. Sensational day photo locations and a must see.
In saying that you return at night for the light show at 8pm and 10pm. A must see.
Taking the night river cruise gets you up close to the night lights show they stop in front of the display giving you a great uninterrupted view. .
At night the riverfront is a sea of lights, rest and entertainment. Vibrant area one has to see. Great to photograph day and night here to see the vast difference.
A MUST SEE DAY AND NIGHT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

As well the high energy buzz around Clarke Quay and Boat Quay with a wide range of entries and bars it offers an easy to follow riverside path for longer walks with artistically painted tunnels that deserve gentler stroll to appreciate the creativity of the artists.

The buildings also provide much appreciated shade if walking during the day."

The view of the place during the day and night are completely different and worth exploring.
,,Scenic walkway,4.0,,"Nice to walk along this 3.2-kilometer in length river, as it is along many rivers. This portion though is within a city. The pathways along its banks give both nice water views and city views. There are many cafés, bars, eateries and souvenir shops along the walkways. Other viewing option, is to take a sightseeing cruise on the river. Many of Singapore's finest attractions are within a few minutes walk of the river. I like it best after sunset, when many of the buildings and other structures are lit up."
,,Great place to visit old and new Singapore,5.0,,This area is great to visit during the day and again at night when the bars and restaurants open. It gives a great mix of old and new Singapore
,,Nice area,4.0,,This is a nice area to stroll around during the evening and have a nice meal in one of the restaurants in the area.
,,Singapore River will draw you in,4.0,,The Singapore River is like a magnet for us. The bum boats add local color while the shoreside restaurants offer a chance to sit with a refreshing drink and admire the River traffic. If you’re in Singapore you no doubt will visit the river. Though not particularly pretty the River does offer its own attraction.
,,by boat or by foot,4.0,,"Take a boat ride down and then a walk along the bank. There are so many things to see along the way and some you miss when in the boat so it is good to take a walk too. There are little statues of a cat with her kittens on a pillar by one of the bridges. Take time to look at the live fish in the tanks outside the riverside cafes' so are really odd.
I made the mistake of sitting down on a concrete pillar without realising it was soaking wet from where they had been washing down the pathway. Good for all ages"
,,Walk-way along,4.0,,"Major points on Singapore river are Boat quay, Clarke quay, and Robertson Quay. This river flows vertically crossing the country, and there are excellent pathways along the river. Best for any time walk on it, you can see many important monuments, buildings, attractions, shopping malls and sky line of Singapore. Lovely place to visit."

,,"Relaxing, cool way to view the city",5.0,,"I went on the boat ride as part of the nighttime tour of Singapore. It took us from the big hotel with the skywalk to Clarke Quay. Since it's so hot and humid, I found the soft breeze coming off the water to be quite relaxing."
,,Nice to walk by,4.0,,It is nice to stroll by the river. You must see the Merlion and pick up a river cruise which has a very good commentary. It is also very pleasant to walk by the river at Clark Quay with many restaurants and bars overlooking the river
,,peaceful and colourful at night.,5.0,,this was outside our hotel window. We loved watching the lights change colour constantly. Walking along the river during the day was lovely although maintenance on the paths needs work with many pavers sticking up and causing trip hazards. The river was very clean with gargabe scows skimming the water every day.
,,A major drawcard of Singapore,4.0,,"The SIngapore River has lots to offer, there is always something about a view of water, relaxing and everchanging with the weather. I would imagine most visitors to Singapore would eventually find themselves on or by the river, there are many attractions, walkways, a variety of bridges, boat tours, museums, cafes and restaurants to be enjoyed by night and day. Just bring a hat and be sun smart."
,,An important view of Singapore,5.0,,So much of the history of Singapore is tied to the sea and the River. A pleasant boat trip points out the sights and important landmarks as well as describes how ships were unloaded in the harbor and goods transported to the sides of the river by smaller boats. Restaurants and shops line the riverbanks now and offer all sorts of local and international food.
,,Must do,5.0,,"A walk along the river. The sites, the sounds - day or night - are memorable. Lots of watering holes and eating establishments. Highly recommend"
,,Pleasant Stroll,5.0,,"Nice to walk around the harbour side on a sunny day. Gain a few good photos of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, as well as the Merlion, the symbol of Singapore"
,,The belly of the carp,5.0,,Here is where it all began - Singapore’s ascent to a trading port. The river is shaped like a carp and the most prosperous area — the belly — is where the financial district is. Take a boat ride down the river and imagine what it was like in the past.
,,Refreshing and cooling on a hot day,5.0,,The Singapore river is now closed off and has become a fresh water reservoir. The boats still continue to ply their trips around to a good look around the harbour.
,,Stroll Along The Quays...,5.0,,"It's a lovely walk, day or night. Almost anywhere along the quays you can find great places for a stroll or a brisk ""exercise walk""....not to mention shopping and good restaurants. You cannot go wrong along the quays in Singapore."
,,"Nice walk, Good food and views",5.0,,This is a very nice place for a walk. There are lots of stores and restaurants. The food was very good but a little pricey.
,,great,5.0,,"you can walk from one end to the other going in to different areas ,boat trips ,go in day to look around, go back in evening to eat and have a good time"
,,Fun ay to spend time,5.0,,There are numerous shops and restautrants along the river. There are also boat tours that might be to your taste. The bars and restaurants are hopping all night and many have live music. Great scene and a fun place to hang out - try the Crazy Elephant for music if you like rock and roll
,,another great walk,5.0,,another great walk. lots of restaurants and eaters. a bunch of shops and a plain relaxing walk that is great to see the buildings on either side of the river.
,,Singapore River,3.0,,"Nothing much in the day. if you do not mind the heat and sun in the day, you can have dining at this place with outdoor and indoor seating, Whole rows of restaurants and bars. More happening at nights , for weekdays, the crowds mainly came from the financial district. Mainly a place for drinks in the night. Not suitable for parents with younger kids. Parking problems here. Travel here by public transport and there is a SMRT nearby provided you know how to walk over from the train station. There is a small shopping mall (The Central Mall) more like a look see look see mall and don't expect much to shop."
,,So pretty at night,4.0,,Very cool area to hang around. Very pretty at night time. Would recommend a river cruise to explore it
,,"GREAT SPOT, BUT EXPENSIVE",5.0,,"Bring money, that's my advise if you are planning on staying in and around the Clarke and Boat Quays. All meals are expensive and in most cases over priced. Try and find a good ""Hawkers"" stand for a much cheaper full meal. The Quay site itself is fabulous and worth visiting, just don't eat there."
,,Extraordinary City,5.0,,"Singapore always fascinates me. Although it is small, it is the most organized city I have ever visiited. Each time I visit, I want to return again and again."
,,"Peaceful by day, manic by night",4.0,,Just about everyone visiting Si gapore must find themselves at the river and the quays. During the day the qipuays are very quiet as most places do not open until late afternoon. At night it looks amazing with all the lights. Ut gets very busy and very noisy but we felt very safe.
,,Great at night,5.0,,The river is beautiful when lit up and night with views of the Merlion statue. Nice place to relax and get a bite to eat.
,,Walking top spot,5.0,,WE walked every day of our visit this area. You have good views for nice pictures. There a lots of restaurants and cafe and you can make boat round trips.
,,WOW,5.0,,"fanatastic at night, the light shows are truly amazing and a must whilst visiting Singapore, its beautiful"
,,Great place to wander or for a night out,5.0,,We stayed just off Clarke Quay and both of us loved the walk down through Boat Quay. The Quays have numerous bars and restaurants and I just loved this area. Try the Penny Black pub for food and drinks at the bottom of Boat Quay
,,Great eating place,5.0,,Comes alive at night with so many eating places. Places to have a drink and listen to music - lovely area just dedicated to having a good time.
,,Lots of restaurant choices..,4.0,,Boat and Clarke quay have so many choices for food and drinks. Singapore is such a fun destination. Recommend the Pennyblack pub - English pub on the end of Boat quay.
,,Many restaurants,4.0,,"Beautiful evenings in Singapore and walked along the river. Singapore does a great job making the walk easy. Both sides of the river have paved walk ways.
Many pedestrian bridges cross fairly frequently. The bridges are well lit and beautiful.
A large variety of bars and restaurants line each side of the river. There is a nice square area with fountains. Part of its is covered, defusing the hot sun.
A couple of caveats: the water does smell in some locations. I believe because it is brackish. It’s a dirty brown.
Small electric scooters and bicyclists ride the same path. I didn’t have any issues it’s good to be aware. The scooters travel very fast.
If in Singapore it’s a must to do river walk."
,,Lovely and lively night spot,5.0,,"You get to enjoy get views of the city’s skyscrapers all lit up very prettily at night. And it’s a lot cooler temperature wise too. Lots of restaurants and pubs to explore. Just taking a walk along the river is so relaxing and enjoyable, nice good clean fun."
,,Just the best way to spend an evening!,5.0,,"Such a delightful way to spend the evening! We caught the boat at Clarke Quay, in itself a colourful and happening place, and travelled down the river with onboard commentary and video, to Marina Bay Sands. There we stopped to watch the light and lazer show......absolutely spectacular...so much better to see it from the water rather than jostling for position on the concourse. Loved every minute of it."
,,Morning Cruise,5.0,,Our first venture in to Singapore and so took a cruise to get our bearings. Excellent narrative given on board explaining the history of Singapore's development
,,Bars and pops,4.0,,One of my favorite places . Many bars and pops and restaurants . They close at 12 after mid night at the weekdays and the club's till 5 a.m at the weekend . And the price really good
,,Short view,3.0,,"This is near the Merlion park. It was nice, very clean. The view at night was awesome. We saw it for a very short period of time because we were on top of the tour bus during the night. During the day it was very hot thus the title of this review."
,,Beautiful Sights to see.,5.0,,One of the best attractions to see. We enjoyed a river boat ride to see the beautiful laser light display. The music played while the light show was on. Such a beautiful trip to do.
,,River ?,3.0,,"It is not a river , it is part of water system , no way out at either end . The round trip from Clarke Quay lasted 40 minutes , a good way to see surroundings and restaurants available , some very good photo opportunities . It was very hot when we done trip , just be warned if you go inside in the shade , and it is full , some find body smell a bit overpowering ."
,,Go in the evening to see the lights and fireworks.,5.0,,Very nice ride on the river. Too hot for us in the afternoon but the evening was nice and the fireworks great.
,,Such a small river front but well preserved and beautified.,4.0,,"Its actually a very small river. In any other country it would be of minimal importance, but for Singapore it is the life line and has been very well managed & preserved. River front has been charmingly developed and is a soothing sight. Take that boat ride and enjoy."
,,Skyline at night,5.0,,Take a stroll along the Singapore River at night or sit by the river and have a quick bite enables one to soak in the cool atmosphere.
,,Beautiful lights and bustling nightlife,4.0,,"If you are a person who enjoys the nightlife, this is one of the must-go places when you are in Singapore. There are many bars around, with live bands and clubs in this area. There are many restaurants a stone's throw away and occasional boats which carry tourists on the Singapore River."
,,Scenic River sights,4.0,,"Very peaceful trip, scenic views and history of the area, knowledgeable guide. plenty of stop off's giving you the opportunity to walk and see your desired sights."

,,A lovely gentle boat ride,5.0,,"a very good narrated boat ride from Boat Quay, round Clarke Quay and around the bay to get different views of Marina Bay Sands, the Merlion and the sights."
,,An all freshy day River Front in Bustly City,5.0,,"Always will stroll in the morning and late evening to enjoy, feels relax and ease to ponder your lifestyle. A great place to be with a fantastic view of the past, present and future skyline of the city..👍🇸🇬"
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,Lots of places to eat along the riverside and it was good to have a variety of different nationalities of food to choose from. Prices a bit higher than else where in the city but maybe you pay for the location.
,,From Clarke`s Quay to Marina Bay,4.0,,"We took a stroll from Clarke-`s Quay to Marina Bay and it was amazing. Even if the Singapore River Festival was a bit of a dissapointment, the views, the buildings and all the air were not to be forgotten."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Didn't take boat just walked , gorgeous river , every part is attractive with plenty of photo opportunities . Walked this river daytime and at night , both a must . Plenty of bars and restaurants around to stop and relax in"
,,I remember the bumboats.,4.0,,"On my first visit to Singapore in the 1970's, a city tour included a 30 minute ride in a bumboat along the river. The river and surrounds were hives of activity and the landscape much different to today's. The place was dirty and smelly, all types of refuse in the river; but it was exciting and exotic, my first taste of the Orient. So much change, the river now a reservoir and included in the plan to make Singapore self sufficient in water resources in the not too distant future. The bumboats and junks are gone, no more raucous banter as the workers went about their tasks; the area is sanitised, surrounded by high-rises buildings, restored shophouses, shopping malls, restaurants, cultural facilities, tourists attractions and the preserved remnants of the colonial past, and you now travel the river in comfort in a river taxi or cruise boat powered by electric motors. No more 'putt, putt' of the old motors on the bumboats."
,,Singapore Duck Tours!!!,5.0,,"What a great way to see the city by boat. The tour guide was a wealth of information, funny and professional. The tour took about an hour and we got some great photo's. A must see for the whole family. Make sure to book your tickets through TripAdvisor to get a good deal!"
,,Change for the good,5.0,,"A cruise or walk along the river will show you how the Singaporeans look after their environment with aplomb. 30 years ago this was a dirty smelly area that you would avoid.
The water is freshwater as the mouth of the river has been blocked off from the ocean, the boats are all electric. The eateries and shops along the promenade are a delight, as are the people."
,,Nice river banks for walks,4.0,,"Singapore River runs through the city.

Most tourists take a river cruise. I found that walking along both banks of the river gave you a different perspective of the city. There are cafes, bars and restaurants - and there is something for everyone. The high rise buildings of the financial centre of the city overlook the river. Fullerton Hotel has a rooftop bar which has some very nice panoramic views of the city. It is a great sight to watch the sun set.

One of the famous quays is Clarke Quay which is a very lively place at night. You can sit on the banks and just watch the world go by.

The river forms part of the Barina Bay reservoir. Historically it was used a lot for trade - but this led to pollution. As a result, the river has undergone a clean up - and is no longer used for trade purposes - but more for leisure purposes."
,,Get on a boat or walk along the river banks,4.0,,At the heart of Singapore is the waterways. Is always a relaxing way to spend an evening strolling along the river whilst the sun sets for a day. Particularly heading to one of the many restaurants or bars along the river.
,,Go one hour before sunset.,4.0,,"Clarke Quay worth a visit. It has an ambiance very unique. You can go there by subway, which means a cost of around 1,5 SGD from almost any point on city centre; choose between Clarke Quay station or Fort Canning station. Directions are well visible.
If you choose to take a ride on the river, try to get there near sun set. You’ll get amazing photos at that time.
Some restaurants give you a discount if river boat ticket is showed… unless the food itself is not under promotional price. 
Lot’s of bars, music and foo from all around the world: Mexican, Chinese, Italian, Thai… Even a food they said its’s German, but… I didn’t believe."
,,Amazingly clean,5.0,,"If there's one thing you will definitely notice is that the Singapore River is very clean. Amazing for such a body of water adjacent to a busy city, you would expect it to reek of sewage and filth, but amazingly it is clean. It is nice to take time out to walk along the river along the restaurant row and you will end up at the Merlion monument. This is a definitely tourist destination that shouldn't be missed."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The one thing I loved about everything in Singapore is that you get a different experience from day to night, the river was no exception. The bridges light up colorfully at night with the light from the buildings in the backdrop adding to the decor. During the day many people play in the parks along the river front and eat at the cafes and restaurants. The boat tours run consistently. At night the bars come alive with music and dining with many restaurants setting up seating along the river for ambiance and style."
,,spent your evening here,5.0,,clean. nice view. relaxing walk. can have dinner at the stretch of restaurants. Can stroll from Raffles Place. inexpensive restaurants.
,,Something different,5.0,,We started this trip just before it gets dark so that by the time we were half way round the lights were on and we saw the river by light and by lights - both amazing and so different. You must take a meal by the river and then take a boat trip along it to fully enjoy the atmosphere and the food.
,,Night River Boat,3.0,,"Expected better, the driver never spoke, they just put a video on, the trip was a little rushed, and a drop off in the music and bar areas"
,,Best place for party,5.0,,"This place is amazing for party, full of discos and bars to have a good drink, with he view of he river and good music."
,,be over at night,5.0,,It is so beautiful and really pretty. I keep thinking about the night view in Singapore. Unforgettable memory
,,CENTRAL TO MANY ATTRACTIONS !,5.0,,I find the Singapore River central to the exploration of Singapore. The river is close to/adjacent to many attractions. An easy way to visit these attractions is to buy a 24 hour river taxi pass. This allows you to hop on and off at different locations at your convenience.
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Singapore River has quite a history to it before it becomes what it is today. It extends to Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay and each quite different to the other. It would worth learning a little bit of its history to appreciate its current beauty.
Boat Quay is right smack in the CBD area and where those working in the Raffles Place area and its vicinity go for their lunch at one of the many bars, cafes and restaurants along the river or the street parallel to it. In the evenings this is also where the working professionals mingle and have drinks after office hours. The area comes alive. On Friday and Saturday evenings, the street is closed to traffic from 6pm to 1am.
Clarke Quay is party central where there are not only restaurants and bars but also night clus, a favourite of the young when the sun sets. Food wise, there are plenty of good restaurants offering Asian, Western, Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean and many other cuisines.
Robertson Quay is probably the most finesse of the 3. Families with young kids tend to prefer here as there is a ""promenade"" by the river where the kids can scooter/cycle while the parents chill at a bar/cafe/restaurant. Restaurants aplenty and with no night club in the vicinity, it is more sedated and relaxing."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We stayed at the Robertson Quay Intercontinental on the river. You could spend days in the same area and not experience enough. Take a ride on the Extreme Swing for a life time memory. The Al Kalf bridge is also a delight.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Definitely worth spending time on or around the river. You can catch a riverboat cruise to get your bearings. Then go back to the appealing parts. There are lots of restaurants and museums all along the river.
,,wonderful area,5.0,,"Plenty of restaurants, nice views, not much traffic, the water, central. What is not to like. not essential but still very worthwhile."
,,Good family activity,5.0,,"Took a stroll in the morning with the toddlers along Singapore River all the way to Clarke Quay Central. Walk was good, view was great, place wasn't congested and air was clean."
,,5 stars for the light show,5.0,,The light show occurs at 8:00pm and 9:00pm. very beautiful way to show how humankind can get creative. don't miss it under any circumstances.
,,Best eateries and beautiful walkways,4.0,,"You can choose your cuisine and you will have the restaurant to go to. Beautiful and lively place with bars, Twinkling lights, happy conversations, good food and great places to hangout. Easily approachable by Metro."
,,Must see,4.0,,"That's a very nice Place for Lunch or also for Dinner, at Night it Looks very colourful with all the lights. Iff you stay in a small Restaurant at Boat Quay Check your Bill befördert you pay, they try to charge for everything, Crackers or Tissue also. I Präferenz Clarke Quay."
,,Night Experience,4.0,,A lovely ride down the river at night with all the lights. Enjoyed. Sit our the back and a great breeze and even better view
,,A great place to go for a lunch or dinner,4.0,,The river area is quite picturesque and there are several good restaurants in the area. It's also reasonably close to Chinatown if you want to visit there.
,,"A great romantic, nostalgic ride",5.0,,It takes only 20 minutes to evoce the past of old Singapore. It's nice to discover the old port buildings.
,,Live life to the full,5.0,,"Clarke quay in the middle with Robertson's and boat quays either side. Fantastic night life, huge array of food and entertainment plus reverse bundgy if your game."
,,A view from the river,4.0,,"We joined a boat ride from Clarke Quay to Marina Bay and back. 45 minutes took the ride - during daytime - with a recorded guide boasting all time about the attractions befroe us. We did see them actually with our own eyes! This could have been a bit more subtle.

The views from the boat were nice, likely even nicer during nightime when we actually did walk the distance!"
,,Very pretty to walk around,5.0,,"Surrounded by restaurants and museums, we found ourselves at the river most nights. It's a buzzy, friendly area, and has gorgeous photo opportunities."
,,Singapore River,5.0,,"A beautifully clean river, like Singapore itself, no litter, no rubbish, just a lovely river that flows through Singapore with historical buildings mixed in with modern venues either side. Well worth catching one of the many boats operating here and experience the ride, enjoy the scenery and listen to the commentary available on some boats detailing the history of the river. A lovely way to
end or even start a night in Singapore"
,,Very nice place,5.0,,"One of the finest riverside where you can relax, have good food, have creazy time all together. Amazing walk and good disco."
,,Singapore River,5.0,,"Singapore River is just awesome during night, it is always silent and it feels great to just sit and relax by the side"
,,"Lively venue, especially in the evenings",5.0,,"There are different restaurants all along the Clarke and Boat Quays, with tables with river views. In the evenings, the bridges on the river are lit up with coloured lights. There is a wide variety of cuisines - Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, Spanish, Italian and an English Pub, to name a few. This area feels safe in the evenings, as there are so many people around. The riverside walks are kept clean, and it is a very pleasant venue."
,,beautiful boat ride,5.0,,calming yet happening place to be.take a boat ride and enjoy the smooth ride. lots of restaurants and pubs besides the river
,,superb.,5.0,,"the river evoked mixed emotions in me. Happiness to see such a beautifully maintained river, sad that Chennai is not able to duplicate this in spite of having 3 waterways flowing through the city. The Singapore river is to be enjoyed both by the cruise and a relaxed walk along the Banks. You can choose to sit where it suits you and enjoy the beautiful views of the city. Ideal time would be to start at dusk and walk till late in the night"
,,Stunning area visit in the evening!!,5.0,,"Stunning place lots to see, an evening visit is definitely a must!!! The light show in the harbour is lovely, the food and drinking places are amazing everything you could wish for and the people are so friendly. The shopping centres all around are amazing."
,,Not open during the day,3.0,,This is now a night activity. Went there last week and only a few places open for lunch. So lovely by the river
,,Cool River!,4.0,,"We had a overlooking the Singapore River back in April. Saw some boat trafftic, mostly restaurants and tourist boats, andf the feeling of eating by the water is Singapore was awesome!"
,,Clifford pier,4.0,,Really nice place to sit and have a drink overlooking the river and marina bay a place we always visit when we go to Singapore
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Well worth visiting day and night. Lots of Restaurant's and Bars, also a few 7Elevens to pick up a few things."
,,Interesting walk,5.0,,"Great to walk along, plenty of development with a large choice of bars and eating places. Very busy with locals all eating out."
,,Beautiful sight,4.0,,It is a beautiful sight. I suggest to come around the time the fountain show takes place near Marina Bay Sand area.
,,The Dormant Dragon,4.0,,"Well that's how I picture it, although perhaps 'snake' might be more appropriate in terms of describing a winding river but 'dragon' seemed more appropriate to Singapore. I stayed at Robertson Quay 3 weeks and didn't realise it was the Singapore River until one day I was crossing Jiak Kim bridge at the Robertson Quay end and read a manhole cover. I asked my friend (who has lived at Robertson Quay nearly 3 years) if it was indeed the Singapore River and she didn't know. I needed confirmation, so eventually found someone who did know. Well anyway, you don't have to know what it's called to enjoy strolling along the River Walk and there are a myriad options for dining, drinking, or both. You won't see any dragon or even dragon boats, but you might just be lucky enough (as I was) to see a giant lizard basking on it's (concrete) banks or an otter or two frolicking in the murky waters under the bridge up near Jiak Kim Street. Also highly recommended is STPI Gallery upstairs at SPRMRKT."
,,Walk alongside,3.0,,"There are fantastic walks alongside the river and a myriad of things to see, do and eat. You can walk all the way out to Robinson’s Quay, recommended."
,,Must do,5.0,,"Must do if in Singapore for a holiday. Safe, clean, amazing architecturally. Plenty of bars and restaurants. Marina Bay, Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay all worth checking out. Could spend 3 days along this stretch."
,,Relaxing and colourful,5.0,,"This is a perfect way to check out the Clarke Quay precinct and beautiful Marina Bay. There is a commentary as your glide down the river and through the bay, taking in many major Singapore sights."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Part of our stay we stayed in Clarke Quay area by the river. Would well recommend the river cruise which is best taken in the evening as you can see so much more in a short space of time instead of walking
,,Simply Spectacular.,5.0,,"Staying at the iHG Robertson Quay, we had the pleasure of watching the sun go down and the River spring to life. The lights, the vibe and the quality of restaurants are quite magical."
,,A great way to spend an hour or so,5.0,,"A very good activity viewing old and new Singapore on a very comfortable, well maintained and excellently manned boat."
,,The Light Show,4.0,,"WE went up the river from Clarke quay after having a nice meal.
The boat leaves from Clark Quay at 8.30 for the 8.45 light show $28.00 well worth it also nice and cool on the river and not so packed.
The boat returns to Clark Quay where there are Bars Restaurants also a mall.

,,Touristy,3.0,,Very touristy and quite expensive compared to other area's. Lot's of bars as well as restaurants to choose from.

,,Great vibe,5.0,,"Lots of dining choices. The river cruise is worthwhile - you can get some interesting photos and the boats are electric powered, so there's no noise and fuel fumes to contend with."
,,Boat tour of the river.,4.0,,"We went on the boat tour around the bay and up the river to Clarke Quay for approximately $25 S each. Audio track explains what you are seeing in a pleasant manner, expounding on the history of the sights. Inside the lovely wooden boat had fans but outside had a breeze. We did the cruise at around 9:30 am and we were the only ones so could move around easily. Lasts 45 minutes and gives great information about the riverside sights."
,,Great around clarke quay,5.0,,"At night this place is alive and vibrant with the lights, bars and restaurants. During the day it is a nice walk down the side of town"
,,Scooting along the river,3.0,,We took the kids scooting along the river pathway near Robertson Quay on the weekend. A peaceful area away from traffic and quite well shaded. The river itself can get a bit dirty but usually it gets cleaned fairly often. The highlight this time was seeing a family of otters enjoying the river.
,,Nice and slow,5.0,,"This is a scenic walk we where staying the bottom of havelock road along the river where you will find a assortment of restaurants to have breakfast lunch and tea.
Most of the walk offers some shad from the sun by the tress along the river side until you get into the city side ,you can walk from the bottom of havelock road all the way to the Singapore flyer or Marina bay sands you will see in the distance.
Make sure if you plan to do you entire walk you have comfortable foot wear and a camera as there are some great sites along the way, there are plenty of places to stop a have a break take a drink even pick up the river cruise it's not a 5 minute walk be prepared if your going from the start to the bay front for a long maybe couple of hours but it's well worth it and if you wish to call it a day there are plenty of taxis around once you hit the Clarke quay area."

,,it is really lively place to chill,5.0,,"the view the calmness, everything is amazing especially if you experience it in the dark at night it is serene"
,,Cruise up the river into the Bay !,5.0,,"If you go upto Clarks Quay in Singapore, you find many riverboats that take you up the bending river and emerge into the Bay area. See all the sights from the water. They turn round by the Merlion and take another slow boatride back to the Quay area. You see the different lifestles on the river."
,,Enjoy a 'bum boat' ride.,5.0,,"We walked either side of the river, exploring and taking in the sights, but gained a whole new perspective from the water. We really enjoyed the experience."
,,Flowing through the Middle of City,4.0,,"The river is in the middle of city and offer great places to spend time like Clarke Quay. It is little dirty, the water was muddy when I visited."
,,Stroll or Boat ??,4.0,,"You can stroll around both Boat Quay and Clarke Quay quite easily. Lots to see and marvel at though bearing in mind the history of this area in Singapore's early days. It can be a bit hot during the day and at night, there's the attraction of the many many bars and restaurants that can 'help' you if you are thirsty or hungry.
But our favourite was the boat trip at night along both quays and then around Marina Bay. Great views with all the lights on and the bustling activities. And very relaxing and non-strenuous to let the boatman take he strain.
You can hop on and off as you wish as well."
,,Boat Quay,4.0,,"Nice stroll along the river at Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Robertsons Quay. Great bars offering half-price beers. Only drawback is people touting for business wanting you to patronise their premises for a meal."

,,Exciting River Boat Tour,5.0,,"It was a hot afternoon, but enjoyed the river boat tour along Marina Bay. Passing through the Singapore Skyline, taking closer photos of the Merlion spitting out water, and the famous landmark of Singapore; the Sky Park Hotel. Just beautiful!"
,,Take a stroll,4.0,,"Many attractions can be found near Singapore River. Quite ideal if your hotel is located along the river for those strolls to the sites or out to dine. Nice day and night. Walk or take a river cruise. Some of the places to access near the river include Clarke Quay (popular evening entertainment area), Boat Quay (charming atmosphere of old shop houses with restaurants, bars and pubs, but watch out for tourist traps and high prices here), colonial buildings housing various galleries and theatres, the Fullerton Hotel and Cove, and then Marina Bay and all its places to explore and experience. There are places to sit and rest along the river, including an area I stumbled across with deck chairs on a grassy lawn under some shady trees. So a place to unwind and watch the world go by."
,,Boat ride,4.0,,Boat ride available in Singapore river. River is so beautiful in night time. but we visited on day time and took boat ride in river. Boat ride cost is SGD 25/-...........
,,Pleasant walk along the river,5.0,,"We started the visit of the river from the Merlion, which is the river mouth. A good place to take photo of the city skyline and Marina Bay Sands.

After that, we walked towards Boat Quay along the riverbanks and we had dinner at one of the restaurants there. We then walked to the nearby Clarke Quay for a drink.

It was a very a pleasant walk along the river."
,,"Relax, Snack and People Watch",5.0,,"During our stay we many times visited the banks of Singapore river to just sit down, relax, eat snack and just people watch. The view changes from late afternoon to night when the lights come on. Don't miss the sculptures on the pathways."

,,Worth doing twice - day and night,5.0,,A brilliant way to learn about Singapore and its history. The staff are friendly and helpful and the on board commentary was well presented and informative. Doing this during the day enabled us to really see all of the sights. During the night if you time it right you have front row seats at the wonderful light shows.
,,Nice view in the evening,4.0,,"Nice view in the evening when lights from surrounding buildings are on. Lots of restaurant, pubs and cafe along the riverbank also."
,,Em's on Tour,5.0,,"Whether visited by day or joining the festive vibe of the waterside the Quay area of the Singapore River is so worthwhile. There is lots to do and see and also the dining out is unsurpassed.
The night lights and illumination of the river have a very special vibe. Watching the river boats going back and forth as passengers enjoy dinner on the water added to the pleasure of this area."
,,One of the best things to do in Singapore,5.0,,"Take a walk in the evening - start at 5.30pm when its not so hot. Lots of things to see and do along the river - Start at Clark Quay (get off at Fort Canning MRT station), and walk along the Parliament House, Asian Civilization Museum, take a short detour to National Art Gallery, cross-over to The Esplanade Theatre, then to Floating Platform, cross again to Marina Bay Sands and then end at Gardens By the Bay (Bayfront MRT)."
,,Best at night.,4.0,,"This a great area to relax and enjoy a meal and at night it also seems a bit cooler than the rest of the city. At night the changing lights around Clark Quay, reflecting off the water, are particularly attractive and worth seeing."

,,Colorful at night,5.0,,Singapore River is the busiest river during the colonial era. The river is clean and has so many attraction along side.
,,great night out along the river,4.0,,"love the colorful waterfront scene. must visit at night for a nightlife experience. if eating along the riverbanks is too expensive, you can have a short stroll via the underpass near Clarke Central mall, crossing to a nearby mini hawker center : BK eating house, or drop by Macpherson seafood for tasty set of BBQ stingray dish. ;) you can still have the lights and river view, and a nice, quiet city view."
,,excellent attraction,5.0,,Boat ride is good . Nice place to walk on the river bank and enjoy a drink with music. Good to spend few hours here.
,,"A Beautiful View, Lots to See, Lots of Restuarants",4.0,,"Its lovely to walk round the river seeing the sights. We did this both during the day and then at night so we could catch the light and laser show. With so much space, there is was no hustling to get a view. The show lasts about 15 minutes and is ok, not the best but interesting. There are a lot of bars and restaurants to get a bite to ear or drink."
,,"MUST WALK this area! Beautiful, great pubs, restaurants, people watching, river boats.",5.0,,"We stayed in a hotel in Clarke Quay (Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay) which is a great location for connecting with other parts of the city via MRT stops. Clarke Quay has a map of the 4 sections of restaurants and pubs that is helpful as it is rather over-whelming just walking around! We loved the Crazy Elephant Blues & Rock Pub and the Mexican place near it. In Robertson Quay there are more restaurants and TAPS brew pub is fun. ""The QUAYS"" are just a fun, colorful, green area with great nightlife and great lunch special. The BRIDGES are all unique and lighted at night, too. A really special part of Singapore. And in the mall, there are wonderful, cheap food courts on the lower level."
,,Take a river cruise.,5.0,,We enjoyed our leisurely river cruise which culminated in a delightful High Tea at the Fullerton Hotel on the waterfront. Couldn’t fault a th8ng about this tour and the food at the Fullerton was superb.
,,Off to the light and laser show,4.0,,Caught the boat from Clarke Quay down the reservoir where we sat and watched and listened to the music as the water spouted and the lasers danced in time to the music. Very pleasant sitting on the water amid all the lights of Singapore City.
,,Best bars and restaurants in town,5.0,,There are plenty of bars and restaurants located along the singapore river. Good place to head for fine dinning.
,,"Interesting by day, incredible at night",4.0,,For only $25 this 45 minute cruise is excellent value in a city which can seem a tad expensive at times. An interesting audio visual commentary points out places of interest which you can later visit on foot. The cruise extends to Marina Bay with excellent views of the Merlion and the incredible Marina Bay Sands Skypark. How on earth did they build that? The area along the river comes alive at night. A very impressive and memorable experience
,,River Cruise by the night!,5.0,,"I was so happy to learn the history of Singapore via river cruise, it is so convenient at night since there will be no direct sunlight."
,,"Good fun, relaxing way to see the sights.",5.0,,"We really enjoyed this short boat trip. Only had to wait 25 mins for a boat ( water b) and had a comfortable and relaxing ride along the river, seeing all the sights- marina bay, Fullerton, Clarke quay, Merlion etc. Excellent way to do it with good commentary."
,,"VERY NICE BOAT TRIP ON SINGAPORE RIVER, FROM MARINA BAY TO CLARKES QUAY.",4.0,,"My wife and I used the chance to make a boat trip from Marina Bay up to Clarkes Quay, a very nice moment, around 45 minutes, with a quick stop next to Merlion Statue. I would advise to do it by night, the view and lightshow should be perfect, we did it unfortunately by day..."
,,Nice to walk along,5.0,,"There are many statues and artworks dotting the promenade along the river.They tell some of the story of the settlement of Singapore plus depictions of everyday life.Also some quite modern and abstract.In particular the big,silver balls that reflect the surrounds in interesting ways."
,,Nice river view,5.0,,"It is worth of seeing both from the wharf, as well as from the boat. During the day you can watch both new and old architecture along the river, at night there is a beautiful view of the buildings lights reflecting in the river."
,,Nighttime lights,5.0,,"Lovely to sit next to the river where supposedly a ‘Merlion’ was seen all those years ago. During the nighttime, it’s wonderful to see the bridges lit up in fanciful colours, the Marina Bay glowing in front of the Merlion Statue and Marina Bay Sands gloriously illuminated.

We sat by Clarke Quay peacefully watching the bridges change colour before meandering to Merlion Park and taking a few Instagram-worth photographs, as Singapore City truly is such a wonderful place."
,,Calm view and nice place to relax,3.0,,Good enviroment but it will be great if there are covered walking along the river so we do not need to worries during raining days.
,,Cooling Boat Trip,5.0,,Take a trip down the Singapore river to escape the heat and the city's bustle. Lots to see before you round it off with afternoon tea in one of the swish hotels nearby.
,,Nice View and Nice place to relax,5.0,,I like the enviroment but it will be great if there are covered walking area along the river so that all travellers/visitor do not need to worries during raining days.
,,A serene river,5.0,,A serene river boat ride amidst a busy cityscape. Cool boats ferry you across a changing cityscape.....must do in Singapore
,,A really hot day!!!,4.0,,You can see the river one you enter the center of Singapore. The river itself has nothing special but the surroundings make this place become speacial.
,,River view is always better than the street view,4.0,,Riverside walk in the evening is so relaxing and you can watch all that skyscrapers for free. But when you want a little evening action the boat trip is the perfect solution. The view from the boat shows Singapore in a different light. With all the modern and old architecture it looks really special and when water reflects all the lights and the guide shares the history it is really special. Singapore has so much to offer that we shared more details about our stay on our WNFdiary blog page.
,,An Evening on the River,5.0,,"I enjoyed this tour in Singapore. The commentary from the guide was helpful. The evening light show as well as views of the city, various buildings and attractions at night for me were well worth it."
,,Must do,5.0,,If in Singapore do a river cruise. We did a night one and it was amazing. Get a different view of Singapore.
,,Worth it and great experience,5.0,,Definitely the best view and great experience. Romantic and cool. Suitable for couples. Give it a try and you will not regret!
,,Cleanest river,4.0,,"This river used to be filled in muck, but now it has been reclaimed. It flows into the Marina Bay. It has some beautiful landmarks on its banks including the famous Merlion Park"
,,Good way to see the Singapore Skyline at Night,4.0,,"Highly recommended if you want to have a relaxing ride and see Singapore's skyline. Added bonus was a very good commentary which was informative and interesting. We went at night and it was so Beautiful with the buildings all lit up. We went after dinner hence there was hardly any waiting time. We got in from Clark Quay and it was lovely to walk through the the area with the live bands playing, the lights and the party crowd moving around. I wished I would stay on and party but we were flying out the next morning (very early). hence we had dinner at Violet Oon Satay Bar & grill (which was FAB) and then went on the river cruise. lovely ending to our holiday in Singapore.
The Best thing about the cruise to me was the commentary. It brought Singapore alive to me. We tend to think about Singapore as a new artificial city but the commentary harked back in time and gave us a small history lesson which I LOVED!!! Made me want to find out more."
,,Lovely boat ride,5.0,,We had a memorable boat ride on the Singapore river. Its amazing how beautiful this city is and the skyline looks gorgeous in the evening once the lights get on. Its something i would highly recommend you do either before or after dinner.
,,Pleasant,3.0,,We took a 25 minute bumboat ride at night . ( I think the last ones are at about 9:30- 10:00 ) It was nice to see the city from the water at night. $25 . Worth doing. The commentary is funny.
,,Great,5.0,,"Great to see all the places on the river . And the history .also staff were so great taking photos for us , very great price"
,,Stunning scenery,5.0,,Take time to take a leisurely boat ride along this river. So many different architectural styles and this river is exceptionally clean.
,,great restaurants,5.0,,We ate at Robinsons Quay and Clarke Quay so many people walking around late at night. Great food and always felt safe
,,Great night visit,5.0,,Lots and lots of bars restaurants and river cruises so many to choose from a great vibe in the evening with live music and the skyline lit up
,,So clean and lovely!,5.0,,"We walked everyday along the river (as we stayed in Robertson Quay). Very easy, clean, fun way to explore parts of Singapore.Just watch out for the motorized scooters that the business men/women use for transportation :-)"
,,Walkable Attraction,4.0,,"The Singapore River is small, walkable, and packed with sights, restaurants, and places to rest. Don't over-estimate the walking, this river is a tourist attraction in and of itself, the very heart of Singapore, old Singapore and business Singapore. It winds back and forth in a short space, with bridges placed in just about every bend. However, if you find yourself at the far end and you're too tired to walk back, just take one of the many water taxis; they run frequently and most stop everywhere."
,,You can possibly avoid this,3.0,,It's not an attraction as such. You can avoid this if you want to see just the Singapore river. It's not that clean and not worth the time unless you have nothing to be done. If you take the boat cruise in the evening then it's a different story where you get to see the citylights which is spectacular.
,,Amazing views and great nightlife,5.0,,"The Singapore River is the perfect place to go for an evening stroll. A good starting point is the Fullerton Hotel or Boat Quay which is right next to the river and then a stroll to Clarke Quay and the other Quays that follow. At night great atmosphere, great views of the city, at daytime it loses quite a bit of its magic. Along the way are plenty of restaurants and bars, Clarke Quay being of course the epicenter of nightlife in Singapore with even more bars and eateries. Any visitor to Singapore should take a stroll along the river at night."
,,"A Great Way to get a taste of Singapore and to see most of the river features, both historically and architecturally.",5.0,,"With regular excursions from numerous points on the harbour, this must surely be the best way to enjoy the principal sights of the City, from the relaxing confines of a quiet motorboat chugging up-river from the harbour, taking in some of the numerous 19thC buildings which formed the historical commercial beginnings to some of the massive skyscrapers which now sit alongside. The boats also provide the best location from which to enjoy the evening lights display."
,,Great place for an evening meal,5.0,,"At night this is a wonder place to eat. Not only is the pollution of the river less apparent in the dark!, there are some lovely places to eat by the water's edge, both in Boat Quay and Clarke Quay."
,,Great to a night walk,4.0,,"We stayed in the Clarke Quay area, so we had the privilege to walk by the river every time we left the hotel. For a late night walk it is peaceful, quiet with beautiful views of Clarke Quay, downtown until you get to the bay."
,,Great night good during day,4.0,,"Joggers and walkers alongside river,good sights during day but even better at night with views alongside"
,,Improved over decades of time,5.0,,"I originally saw the river in 1974 and you have to be amazed as it looks today. Now a magnificent setting for a lot of Singapore's attractions, especially the lights show at night"
,,Colourful former wharf houses,4.0,,line the river and bum boats jostle for position. Rather ttoo touristy for us but probably a must see for most visitors. Busy with bars and restaurants. Pleasant walk along the river.
,,Fantastic....great experience.,5.0,,"After our Singapore Night Out tour with RMG, we were taken up the Singapore River by River Taxi (bum boat) truly wonderful and very picturesque at night. We travelled under historical bridges and passed buildings built hundreds of years ago.This was certainly one of the highlights of our visit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Boat experience on Singapore River is amazing and it is the drinking water for Singapore people. The view is amazing and many best buildings will be crossed across while going in the boat.
,,Hub of entertainment,4.0,,"If you don't know where to go or what to do just follow the Singapore River.

It is lined by restaurants cafes and bars with lots to see and do. The walking paths follows both sides of the river with big entertainment areas such as Clarke Quay to visit.

Whether its a walk or watching the boats travelling or just looking for somewhere to eat, this is the place to start."
,,"Day Good, Night Better",5.0,,"You don't have to pay top price in the nearby luxury hotels to enjoy this area. By day or night it offers a tranquil location ideally suited for a stroll. Virtually a stone's throw from the local rail system - include it on your discounted all day travel card
Personally I think the night lights make it a even greater place to visit."
,,Amazing and exceeding expectations,5.0,,"We took the river cruise trip with no much expectations after having seen the area on our own feet. I truly recommend this trip, not only because of spectacular views on the Singapore’s skyline from the water but also due to the short movie showing the history of the place in an interesting way."
,,Good both day and night,5.0,,"Whether you walk along the river day or night there is always something to see, at night it is the lights of the restaurants and the people at Clarke Quay at in the day you can see the statues and the out buildings that run along the river"
,,A nice stroll,4.0,,A welcome alternative to the hustle and bustle of business Singapore. Early morning; this area is mainly used by joggers and those like us who were out early to explore the river before the steaming heat of Singapore arose. Whilst in the middle of the city it is very peaceful but once the cafes and bars awake it transforms into a vibrant community.
,,At Night time Delight,4.0,,"The river front is beautiful and clean. At night time, the lights come on and it is beautiful. Wonderful and relaxing to walk around"
,,Brilliant and so full of life,5.0,,"You have to visit the Singapore River as it is the hub o the city. There are many attractions here, the Merlion, the views of the Marina Park Sands, the vibrancy of Clarke Quay, the bum boat rides. Good during both day and night."
,,Top spot,5.0,,An absolute gem of a place to visit. An amazing place and space that will make it all worth your while.
,,Super Attraction,5.0,,Best way to see the city core. Relaxed and scenic. Not to be missed and I do it every time I am there.
,,Excellent Boat Trip,5.0,,Very informative and well worth the money to go on the boat trip. Recommend to visitors that only have a couple of days to take in the sights of Singapore.
,,Evening Must Tour of Singapore,5.0,,This part of Singapore is best viewed in the evening with lighting and skyline views of the excellent serene man made river location. The pathway is loaded with dining and nightlife activities.
,,Three Quays with three different personalities.,4.0,,"Being a long-term resident along the river, I finally have the chance to write about the Singapore River precinct. To tourists, the Singapore River is largely divided into three quays:

Boat Quay (pubs and small eateries, restaurants)
Clarke Quay (clubs, pubs, some overpriced food and then some activities)
Robertson Quay (mostly residential with a number of good dining options)

For tourists coming to Singapore River, I'd strongly suggest that you'd figure out where you want to end the evening, because the three quays are strongest in the later part of the day with its choice of dinner and drinking places.

For the highest energy person, you should end in Clarke Quay, that's where all the music and action is. For something a bit less formal, Boat Quay, and if you want more laid back, Robertson Quay.

I'd strongly suggest you take a river boat tour which starts in Clarke Quay, it gives you a quick overview of the most exciting bits of the river and its history.

<Trivia> The river has changed tremendously over the past 15 years since they converted it into a reservoir, so there are no longer any tides. This had an interesting upside as during low tide in the past, the water levels would dip and there would be a stench from the mud underneath, this is no longer a problem."
,,Amazing and beautiful,5.0,,I did the boat ride which shows you many buildings along the way and also enlighten people with the history. Keep this in the evening
,,Pleasant place to wander and see sights of Singapore,4.0,,"We wandered down and up the river from Richardson Quay, to Clarke Quay to Marina Bay. You can do this on either side of the river and see the landmarks, sculptures and eating places along the way. Some of the sites you see include Government buildings. historical and art museums, the old Chinese eating area and lots and lots of eateries of every description whilst Clarke Quay also has dining areas on boats and the strange seating areas in plastic which stretch out over the river with a network of covers over the paths. There are also tree lined paths to give shelter from the sun and rain and many people seem to promenade along here in the evening - a place to see and be seen. Lots of outdoor eateries and a few malls along the way.

You can also travel along here by boat but I'd recommend walking it as you will see so much more."
,,Nice to walk along at night,4.0,,Nice to walk along the Quay area at night with many bars and restaurants. Also the Waterfront Promenade with Marina Bay Sands and nightly light and water show.
,,Our top spot in Singapore. River ambiance. Boat Quay,5.0,,"Located on the banks of the Singapore River the Boat Quay area is a ""must visit"" when in Singapore. Highly accessible, including on foot while one takes in the sights and wonders of this amazing world best city. We use Singapore or Emirates airlines to get there. Some of our friends use Quatar. We recommend arriving there late afternoon around 17:30 and then take a stroll along the riverside. Then stop for an early sundowner overlooking the river. Many options. We like the Penny Black British pub. It's lovely. Then take a short river cruise and have dinner as sun sets and the lights of the city twinkle on. Wonderful. For dinner, Sri Lankan pepper crab or North Indian curry are our longtime favorites. Numerous options and venues along the river banks. One can quite easily walk to Raffles from Boat Quay."
,,A good place to wander,4.0,,"We walked along the river and took a boat ride there. We enjoyed it all, particularly the interesting buildings and sculptures along the way."
,,Night time around 8p.m. is the best time to take a boat around Clarkes Quay and you won`t be disappointed!,4.0,,"Stayed at the Park Hotel and the river is just around the corner,lots of restaurants and bars to choose from including Hooters if that is your thing,pick up a boat from Riverbee and relax as you go up towards the Quay area .At night you have the laser lighting and fireworks at the Marina Sands Hotel, as you ride around the bay,there are so many restaurants and bars along the front and all are pretty good just decide what you want to eat and go for it!Really buzzing and for me so close to my hotel."
,,Great areas to visit,5.0,,"Lots going on in each of the Quay areas, busy of a night but very quiet during the day Lots of bars and restaurants in each, massive choice of food styles"
,,A 'dusk' trip from Clarke Quay to Marina Bay Laser Show,5.0,,"This service provided by RIVERBEE was recommended by a fellow guest at the Park Hotel, Clarke Quay. Departure was just as dusk was approaching and as we progressed downriver, so the illuminations became stronger. We arrived in the Bay at a point just in front of the Marina Sands Hotel and the 8pm (every Night) show started, magical presentation of music, water fountains and laser lighting that dazzled all the passengers. A memorable evening."
,,Good place for going out in the evening,5.0,,There are many small restaurants and bars with live music till the morning. Unfortunately sometimes overpriced. Anyway a must see if you are in Singapore.
,,Enjoyable walk.,5.0,,I enjoyed to walk alongside the river and stop from time to time to have snack or drink from the shops. Everything looks so clean and the water is not smelly. Its a nice atmosphere if walk in the evening when all the lights are on!
,,"Clean, lively, and beautiful way to experience Singapore",5.0,,"The Singapore river area will give you a flavor of museums, shops, and restaurants that no other area of Singapore will. At either day or night time, there are options galore to experience."
,,A stroll by the river !!,5.0,,recommend to jus walk by post sunset... nice place to have a good talks and many places near clarke quay to have good food and drinks.
,,Great Area,5.0,,"If you're visiting Singapore, you'll want to go here at night and on more than one occasion. The history of the Quays (""Keys"") is most interesting but the food is the reason to go. There are hundreds of restaurants along the Quays and plenty of nightlife."
,,Beautiful meandering walkway by the river,5.0,,"Our hotel was on the river promenade so we used this a bit. It was a really lovely picturesque way of getting between the hotel and the downtown area. Easy to zip off the promenade and into other local attractions such as Clarke Quay, Fort Canning, etc. You can take this the whole way into the city and around to Marina Bay Sands and beyond so a good way to have an easy walk. On a really hot sunny day, choose the side of the river you want to walk on to maximise the shade as the promenade itself is not usually undercover, however there are lots of trees in some areas you can duck under for more shade or cover if needed. Not suitable for a rainy day walk though (unless you love walking in the rain :) ) Walkways are typically smooth, wide and easily navigable by those with mobility issues."
,,A very pleasant stroll,4.0,,"Clean, easy walking with lots of bars, restaurants, convenience stores and excellent views of the city."
,,Just a river,3.0,,It is just a river near clarke quay (and another quays). The place of expensive cafes. Go here if you have a lot of money to spend.
,,Beautiful lights and so serene at night time,5.0,,This is a great experience and a must do in Singapore at night time. The lights and the boat trip from one end to the other are a must. It costs about $25.00 per head and the boat takes about an hour for the full trip.
,,Beautiful views,5.0,,"Many of the sights are located around the river, and in the evening there are great views, especially during the show Spectra"
,,great place to have a nice walk and drink,5.0,,nice place for a walk and so many restaurants and cafe's here. you can come for a drink or dinner. walk by the water and take a look at all singapore. i suggest you start your walk from great world mall that's the best start then walk towards the restaurants and cafe's as it start quite residential area and then it gets more crowded with ppl. as you go it will get busier until you get to clarke where there is al the bars/clubs.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Nice to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere, lots of good restaurants from all kinds of cuisines and bars in the area.."
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"I normally walk in the early part of the morning. It is a beautiful walk...I love how the walkway bridges are lit up. And the Art display on the walk at one point is pretty.
At that time of the day, the river is beautiful and tranquil.
The best part of the walk is that there are no cars, so no polution.
However, the tiles, in certain parts need to be replaced as they seem to be coming out."
,,Lots of eating places,3.0,,"We wandered round here and there were loads of different eating places, but didn't feel it was very authentic."
,,Lovely to see the buzz of the city,5.0,,"You are bound to see locals out for a run, dining and tourists seeking to explore the city along the Quay through the year. The Singapore river is a melting point for the city. The edges are lined with restaurants and bars and there is ample choice. Highly recommend it, especially in the evenings when it is less sultry and a bit windy. Love going for walks and meals to the Boat Quay!"
,,Relaxing river cruise,5.0,,We enjoyed a sail up and down the river and harbour area and took in lots of the sights of the Singapore river.
,,Beautifully presented,5.0,,"We walked a number of times in the late evening back to our hotel in Tiong Bahru from the Marina along both sides of the river.

As well as feeling perfectly safe and comfortable, it is possible to walk the entire two miles with only crossing one road (North/South Bridge Rd), as all the other roads are traversed by underpasses.

The river is a myriad of lights, with the river bank itself illuminated, and the numerous bridges over the river tastefully floodlit. There are numerous preserved godowns (warehouses) lining the river bank which now mainly serve as bars, but at least they are preserved."
,,like a river in hongkong,4.0,,"this place if u see like a hongkong,, like a river in hongkong, i think u must visited at night because so beautyful, u can see singapore night"
,,A Place for a Boat Cruise,4.0,,The Singapore river is really not a river in the true sense of the word river. It is more of a huge lake!
,,Night life on the river,5.0,,The restaurants along the river come alive at night with music and people. The boat rides can be boarded at Clarke Quay for a quick tour of the city. Shopping is also available.
,,A neighborhood to enjoy,5.0,,"We stayed in a hotel at Clark Quay, which made us walk the site every day. It is enjoyable and interesting at any time of the day, but on sunset is the best moment."
,,"Beautiful, Scenic.",5.0,,"Must visit with you loved ones! One of the most serene and attractive place to be! Seeing the river by boat is a very relaxing way to spend an hour,the views are just breath taking... just awesome by night, the river at its best."
,,Beautiful river full of history,5.0,,"The Singapore river has played an important part in Singapore's history since colonial days. Nowadays it is really pleasant to stroll along during the daytime or to visit during the evening time. Our favourite place is Clarke Quay because we had a really nice meal overlooking the boats on the river. However, we did manage a very pleasant walk from beyond Robertson Quay all the way down to the Merlion. We didn't manage to take a boat ride, but we nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed the walk."
,,Very clean,4.0,,The river is very clean and the Government of Singapore did a good to restore it and made it to a tourist attraction.
,,Mesmerizing hot spot hangout touristy place,5.0,,"Very clean, well maintained and amazing spot in Singapore. It is widely spread and covers a great part. It is known as Quay here. So this is majorly split into Clark Quay, Boat Quay and Robertson Quay, they all have river side restaurants cafes, well maintained, clean and beautiful, Must visit very happening live music, popular sea food, all types or cuisine though. Le Noir, Zouk etc. one of the best pubs here with amazing music.
Veg and Non Veg all types of food. A hearty hangout place. Clark Quay is huge and 100+ cafes and pubs, boat quay is more of a lunch place for the raffles business/working crowd as it is situated on the raffles district. There is also a boat ride cruise options as well available, then there is a special kind of bungy ride which is insane for adventure lovers.
All in all Clark quay is a must go place."
,,Best trip on the river to see the sights,5.0,,"I hope that I am reviewing the correct operator here as there appears to be quite a few, if I am then I can thoroughly recommend the 7.30 trip from Clarke Quay down the river to the Marina Bay Sands to see not only the sights fro both sides of the river but the main ""Floor-show"" The light display at Marina Bay Sands was exceptional and was one of the highlights of our Singapore trip"
,,Very relaxing as well as interesting,4.0,,"We went on the river as part of a tour, were ushered onto the boat very efficiently and went down river , past the Fullerton Hotel and the Merlion Lion Statue, turned around at the bottom and went back. Some great photographic shots to be had."
,,River,3.0,,The river is wide and offers boat tours. Although the water has been cleaned for some years it does still appear very brown but I guess the monsoon rains will have had an effect.
,,a great place to wonder,4.0,,"stayed at an hotel near by. so it was nice to be able to walk along side of the river right to the bay area. lots of bars and restaurants, your can also take a boat trip around the bay, I did it at night with great views."
,,Best at twilight,5.0,,We know this place as Clarke Quay. It is the heaven for food lover in the evening. The view was amazing everywhere we looked at. Worth a visit in the evening. Actually one can walk from Chinatown to this place. It is only one or two bus stop.
,,Good light show,4.0,,"Good light show in the evenings. Many people view this, so come early to get a spot. Many activities surrounding the river. The renovation is going to make this place look great."
,,Its has History behind it.,3.0,,This Place i thought to be very cool & iconic as it connects to lots of hertiage structures of Singapore.. But the river was little dirty during my visit.. It could have been a different story if it was cleaner.
,,Quaint,4.0,,"It’s pleasant enough during the day but have seen better elsewhere, maybe at night it delivers better views creates more interest. It’s pricy for food and beer need to what’s how the advertise their specials, at the end of the day there’s nothing on special."
,,Electric boats,5.0,,The boats are electric so silent and pollution free. I actually had the boat to myself as it did the circuit. The guide even played happy birthday to me! On board video explaining the sights.
,,Do Not miss,5.0,,A complete transformation of the Singapore River once a very cluttered and not very clean place dating right back to the founding of Singapore. Now brought completely alive a great place to visit both during the day and especially at night.
,,A walk you need to do when in Singapore!,5.0,,"Its a favorite chill to walk up or down or both - I prefer the upper Rob Quays area for foods, but the walk towards the sea as well as the different areas is just amazing. You can bike as well, or go for jogging."
,,Nice at night,5.0,,"The whole area can be a bit dead (and hot) during the day, so best visited at night when the whole area is lit up and full of life. I remember the area from the 1970s when it was full of warehouses and small shopfronts and a few slums, with the river chocked with boats carrying cargo from the harbour. Today it is much cleaner and there are a huge number of restaurants and small eateries to relax at. Definitely worth an evening out. Glad that many of the historic buildings and structures in the area have been preserved"
,,A good way to see the waterfront sights,4.0,,The river boats stop at various points around the waterfront so get on anywhere convenient. You stay on for a complete tour back to where you got on (i.e. not hop-off). Great for seeing and photographing the iconic sights on the waterfront and there is a recorded commentary in English describing the views.
,,Interesting historical waterway,3.0,,Worth the walk from Clarke Key to the harbour. The restaurants along the way are expensive. Nice to see but not a crucial sight to see.
,,a must do,5.0,,Singapore like most great cities is a river city. Great way to relax and let someone else point out attractions. Good to do at night or during day. Or do a cruise both times of the day
,,Lined with Restaurants and Bars,5.0,,"Robertson Quay, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay are all lined with restaurants and bars. The River itself was dirty brown after torrential rain in Dec, so very unappealing. Right after New Year, most restaurants in Clarke Quay were not open for lunch but open by 5pm. Boat Quay seemed to open all day"
,,Lovely river Singapore River,4.0,,Lovely river Singapore River Current River I visited it a few times and it is nice and worth a river ride And wandering around it Especially after noon before Sunset I would recommend taking the camera
,,go at night only if you want to see real singapore.,5.0,,at night in river activities such as boat food and all very much awesome.famil or couple can very much enjoy. down the earth place.
,,Western Food and Bar Fix,3.0,,Both sides of the river are lined with bars and restaurants so if that's what your after then this is one of the hot spots. Dead during the day but very lively at night. If you have young children then visiting or eating before 9.30pm is fine. The other popular attraction here are the Bum Boats for river cruises and they leave from various points on the quays.
,,Amazing night vibes in the heart of Singapore night scene,5.0,,"Lovely view with exciting bars, club and restaurants around. Good balance of fast paced night scene and some serenity in between."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It's great to see, how the waters come into one. We seen it in the day, bet it would be beautiful at night"
,,Singapore River.,5.0,,"This lovely part of Singapore, leading into Marina Bay, is clean, busy, full of restaurants of every variety on the left bank. Boats ply their trade with passengers and tourists both by day and evening. The lights are ablaze in every tall building around, giving a spectacular display right along the river, but in particular in Boat Quay, which then leads on to Robertson'a Quay further out beyond the popular Clarke Quay. It gets really busy there in the evenings, so it is best to go early, but the further along from Boat Quay, the crowds do begin to thin out a little."
,,Life Line of Singapore ...,5.0,,For me Singapore and the Singapore river start at the same iconic place of Marina Bay .. It is the most beautiful place of the city .. many attractions lie on the riverside .. There is even a boat cruise for the tourists ..

,,A bit tired,2.0,,"About 10 years ago the area by the river felt really cool, but now it feels like it could do with a bit of TLC, to be honest. We were headed for a lunch but the ambience just wasn't what it used to be. Singapore has spent a lot of time and money elsewhere, with excellent results. I kind of hope they can boost this area without losing any of the inherent charm present in the old buildings within the next few years."
,,Lovely walk from Fullerton Hotel to Great World City,5.0,,"Just follow the river along the well maintained path all the way from Fullerton Hotel to reach Great World City shopping centre if one has the time.

,,Excellent place to spent the evenning,5.0,,"Best time is in the evening.To reach the place you get off at Dobi gaut MRT. We preferred the Boat quay on the rt side of the bridge. Never eat at the first few eateries you see, they are the most expensive walk and ask around. Spicy crab start @ 70$ , can come down to 40 $ per KG if you travel further. there is a river cruise at the end boat quay changes 25 $ per person for a peaceful cruise. Spend a wonderful evening here."
,,Only walking along.,3.0,,"We did not decide to take any boat, just walking along admiring the view. As everything in Singapore nice, clean."
,,Beautiful walks day or night,5.0,,"Stayed at the Swissotel Merchant Court this the river was right on our door step. It was a lovely walk in the evenings strolling along deciding where to eat.

The subways are a must see, they are highly decorated with murals which are very colourful."
,,Nice place to spend the evening,5.0,,"The banks of Singapore River is somewhere you would like to be every evening. Historically significant, this is the river which was used to sail the ships through the warehouses where spices were stored. This river was used as a trading outpost for a long time.

Best way to enjoy the river is to hop into one of the river taxis, which will cost you 25SGD per adult and will sail you on the river for almost 40 minutes, taking you till Merilon, Marina Sands, pass through the Boat Quay, Clark Quay etc. You get a chance to sail through and enjoy the history being narrated in the ship.

On the bank of the river in Boat Quay, you have several food joints where you can enjoy awesome food and drink. It's an ideal place to hang around in evening."
,,Good place for a walk,4.0,,"Singapore river is very well maintained and up keep. My friend and I took a walk along Singapore River and we came across many wonderful attractions along the way.

,,Great walking and entertainment areas!,5.0,,"This is a great asset to the city and they have done a nice job of developing the Quays into entertainment areas. There are easily accessible walking areas along the river, great views and plenty of restaurants and night clubs. Some areas like Clarke Quay have canopies to block the sun. This area really comes alive at night with great lighting, music and plenty of people watching. Shopping can also be done here. One great restaurant we ate at was Vino Rosso - a nice Italian place near Robertson Quay. Perfect for a night stroll or nightclub trip."
,,Great experience and easy.,5.0,,"It is a nice way to show your visitors the town looked by the sea.

The cost is SGD25 per adult and the boats are really new or in perfect conditions.

,,Highly recommended for a stroll in the evenings,5.0,,"Start at either end. I recommend taking a MRT to Clark Quay, and walk all the way to Shenton Way.

The river is best viewed at night, when the colorful lights transforms the area into a futuristic playground. Wander around Clark Quay where there are often some event going on. There are pubs, restaurants and clubs galore. Then down to Boat Quay to the many restaurant serving seafood, Japanese and other cuisines.

During the day, the area is much quieter and there is much less to see. But if you are in the area, there are loads of lunch specials to be had."
,,"Serene by day, stunning by night!",4.0,,"This a beautiful area to walk by day and by night; flanked by many attractions, restaurants & bars. Carefully designed colored lights mounted on buildings, bridges and ferries make this a carnival of color after dark."

Many of the shops weren't open yet but I was able to hop on a bumboat for another view of the city. The boat ride is a bit pricey for a 40 minute ride but It was relaxing and worth the trip. There is a narrated video that runs and talks about the riverside landmarks. I would have liked to have heard more of it but Unfortunately I hopped on a boat that was part of an Asian tour group and their tour guide spoke over the video to his group in Mandarin so I missed a lot of it. However, the sights along the river are very picturesque and interesting."
,,Excellent selection of bars and restaurants,5.0,,"Runs from after Quayside to the Esplanade. Full of bars and restaurants with great access to other areas of Singapore Greatly developed over the years with 4 main areas that have now become one (Robertson, Clarke and Boat Quays along with the Esplanade area)"

,,Lovely trip,5.0,,This is a pretty amazing trip. We have done several trips on the river and they are all worth it especially at night to see the city in lights.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is a superb place to cool down. One should visit at night when the life looks very active. Surrounded by diff Quay and good for shopping too.

,,Tourist Attraction - Worth A Try,4.0,,"Singapore River boat ride is a very touristy thing. However, this area is very clean and surrounded by world class dining establishments. You can witness both Boat Quay and Clarke Quay by surrounding the Singapore River. The lighting is colourful and beautiful too and there are lots of night life surrounding this area too."
,,Magical atmosphere,5.0,,"Here you can breath a european air, surrounded by lights and music. All the ""Quays"" are close together or rather beside one another, but in my opinion the most attractive si Clarke Quay. The colourful boats, music and the relaxed atmosphere will get you fall in love. MRT station: Clarke Quay or any financial district one, Singapore is smaller than it seems to be."
,,Light display from river boat cruise,4.0,,Being on the water when the light display is going on at Marina Bay Sands is a magical place to watch the light show from. I found it to be better than sitting on the shore watching the display.
,,Most relaxing around Robertson Quay,4.0,,"Boat Quay is a fabulous backdrop to start at. Walk along to Clarke Quay (more life, music and tourists), then wander down to Robertson Quay for a more laid back, quieter dining experience. Plenty of restaurants to tempt you, The Red House for seafood is a firm favourite and Dabawallah for curry is super too. Lots to explore away from the noise of Clarke Quay."
,,PERFECT PLACE TO STROLL OR CYCLE,5.0,,"Several kilometres of serene waters, brunch venues, cafes, bars and nightlife. May take a while to walk so try booking a Cycling Tour on Airbnb."

,,worth it,5.0,,There are no words that can describe the sights and smells that you experience as there are a lot of things to see
,,Marvelous are for people watching,5.0,,"Take a stroll along at any time of day, evening are especially lovely when lit up, all Quays are different from each other, Robertson Quay seems to have more upmarket restaurants, Clarke Quay is very lively, marvelous place for a drink, live bands etc, Boat Quay has a lot of restaurants, but you can be hassled as your going along, but all in all a very nice place for a stroll"
,,great night spot was here on my last night atmosphere everywhere,5.0,,"took my third and last walk to clark quay on the saturday night, cool air by the river, restaurants bars dancers somuch to do. people to meet. first came across a belly dancer , then a band with a great female vocalist and bass player. finally into the infamous crazy elephant with rock band and a guiness or two. and to think no fear of catching the mrt or cab back to your hotel so safe."
,,Cycling trip in the night,5.0,,"Just the sheer awe of watching the brilliant lights of Singapore downtown in the night as you cycle down the Tanjong Rhu promenade, up the Marine Barrage and to the Garden by the Bay is spectacular. The tracks is relatively easy, cool breeze blows in from the river and there are stunning views of helix bridge, gardens and more....very very recommended. I loved it. Do try the bike experience when in Singapore"
,,Beautiful by Night,4.0,,"We didn't take a cruise, but walked along the riverwalk, nice and clean, lots of other people on cruises. Lights reflected into river of a night-time which was pretty."
,,Night Time Activity,5.0,,"Probably one of the best areas to hang out at night. The area is dotted with cafes, restaurants, lounges and bars all situated right by the bay. The outdoor sitting areas are charming and very touristy. It is a must experriencce when in Singapore"
,,Beautiful in the evening,5.0,,beautiful river. evening is the best time to visit... there are many points.. clarke quays is the best area enjoy the river...
,,attractive,5.0,,"very relaxing to have a walk along the path after dinner, in between the two banks can see the old and the new."
,,Lights,4.0,,"I must admit ratting the river is not an easy task so I hope it wasn't a harsh rating.
So to be fair, the river is not very beautiful and the water is quite green though it is kept as clean as possible and it doesn't have a bad smell. But at night, it's a different story with the bright colours and lights on both sides and the many cafes and restaurants overlooking the river. I highly advise to admire the river by night but be aware of the restaurants and don't choose the ones with over-priced menu while in daylights try a stroll by its side in a sunny day."
,,Very Significant To Singapore History,4.0,,"The river used to be the main hub for trade. There is a statue showing Laurie Johnston an early Scottish trader negotiating with Chinese traders, one of children playing by the river. This was their swimming pool, as well as being the main supply of water for those living in the area. It’s a fantastic area to stroll from The Boat Quay to Clarke Quay, the Bay area and beyond. Lots of restaurants and bars on the way, but in the heat you need lots of stops,"
,,Not so busy,3.0,,"It's a river that was once a busy waterway used in daily life for the locals. Nowadays it's busy as a tourist spot. What's nice is there is a water taxi that can take you to different spots along the river. Which is nice if you don't want to take land transport. Take the river cruise for a different view of the Singapore, day or night."
,,Nice riverside: Ordinery river,4.0,,"The river is not a good one. But, the colorful riverside that looks great in night. Nice hotels, shops,"
,,Great area for walking,5.0,,"Lots of great people watching, plenty of bars and restaurants . Great sightseeing. Day or night attraction. Easy access from MRT and from Fort Canning Park. The boat rides are extremely popular, run till about 10 PM."
,,The River - the major attractions surrounding are the drawcard,4.0,,"Singapore River is not one of the great rivers of the world (or even the region) - the point is that it centres the visitor on a variety of attractions, from Clarke Quay and Boat Quay and various river boat attractions (sight seeing/floating restaurants) in one of the most vibrant, essentially man made localities in the world. China Town is near by as is the Singapore Wheel and more eating/restaurant possibilities than any normal traveller could cope with. It is uniquely Singapore - many love it, some are unimpressed but the locality is a must see and do for any visit to Singapore. It will never disappoint."
,,You will love a visit to the River,4.0,,"What a great place to visit, we went both day and night. Our day trip was full of surprises on both sides of the river, plenty of restaurants, vendors and bars for a casual stop and explore, at night these places became even more alive. The large shopping malls in the area were a refreshing break from the heat with great air conditioning and shopping, the ice cream stalls offer some amazing flavours and are reasonably priced, we walked the full length of the precinct, it filled a good half day when visiting some of the historical well preserved buildings and bridges, its a good day out with plenty to see and do."
,,The Riverwalk beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,"A walk along the Riverwalk takes you from Clarke Quay and Robinson Qual, on both sides you can make the walk, one side is quiet with local apartments or condos, the other has the bars and restaurants and either side works well. You can eat at some of the places here, stop for coffee or drinks, and always see something going on. If you like to take a walk in the evening, this is the place to do it."
,,Nice River - Good eating places - Tourists should visit,5.0,,"Review by Dr Sim. In the past, the Singapore River used to be dark and stinky. Now it is a beautiful river. All thanks to the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the efficient civil service. Tourists should visit this place especially either Boat Quay of Clarke Quay. There are restaurants linking the river. A bit expensive to eat. Cheaper if you just have a beer and watch the people walk by. Go in the late afternoon after 5pm or evenings. Cooler. Regards DrSim001"
,,The Riverside!,4.0,,"Stayed at Robertson Quay so spent a lot of time walking to the MRT, along the river banks. Very good walking, jogging, cycling paths. Hive of activities day and night - all the restaurants and bars. Worth a visit."
,,Lots to do either side and interesting statues,4.0,,"Lots of bars, restaurants and people watching to do on rather side of the river. There are many hotels and Malls on or near the banks and always something going on on the river. There are some interesting statues on the Riverside and you can easily stroll down one bank and cross over to the other to return to your start point dropping in for refreshments or meal in one of the many places on the Riverside. The round trip is probably just over 2km and bearing in mind the heat and humidity could easily take half a day depending on pit stops."
,,A must see place,5.0,,"A big attraction, specially around the bay area. Very well developed river front. A lot of attractions lined up within about 1 km radius. Depending how much time you have you can spend any amount of time in this area. Half a day is a must. Specially if you can explore the entire area and that too on foot, you will love it. Exceptional ambience. A lot of phot ops if you are a shutterbug !!"
,,Romantic Sight,5.0,,"Be sure to be at the Singapore River for a beautiful night view with bright lights from Clarke Quay and Central Mall, all are a view to remember."
,,"Get the water taxi if you can, rather than a cruise",5.0,,"Same routes, but cheaper! great views, took some fantastic photos here during the night of some of the skyline and all of the different lights on the water make it very worthwhile."
,,"Are, so relaxing & good scenery.",5.0,,"We boarded the river cruise and had a wonderful time relaxing & taking photos. If you are a photographer this is the place to be, there is a picture opportunity at every bend of the river"
,,"Worth a walk along, how ever far you go.",5.0,,"The walk goes for miles and you can do as little or as short as you like. It can get hot on a hot day but you can stop anywhere as there are Mall, bars and restaurant's along the way. Great boat ride that you can also do, night or day. The boat ride is over priced but we did it anyway to get a good perspective from a water view. We had a nice day out walking from Clarke quay to the Merlion and back. Great at night with the lights and cooler weather."
,,Excellent Place for the Couple,5.0,,"The place is very nice you can take a boat ride from Clarke Quay and you can try the bunjy jump.You can also try the trishaw ride,The place is surrounded by restaurant"
,,Singapore river..,4.0,,"Singapore river is the one we are seeing while you are at the marina bay. The surrounding areas are developed so much that it has become a centre of attraction. It's well maintained now a days, thereby becoming a tourist location. There are a number of sculptures along the Singapore river, many of it depicting the life of people along the river during the early days of Singapore. I am sure no one will miss this one once you are to marina bay."
,,Singapore River,3.0,,Singapore River is the major natural water body of Singapore along which the city of Singapore has developed. What earlier used to be polluted river has over the years transformed into a major landmark in Singapore. The many quays and bridges alongside and over the river are nice places to walk by and spend an evening.
,,its a river,3.0,,As rivers go this one offers less than most. Singapore is a very new city which offers many advantages but the ambience along the river is not one of them. Would not be a feature I would recommend to anyone visiting the city. There is lots more to see that is of greater interest
,,"Worth exploring the area, lots to see and take in",4.0,,"I walked near the river to various of the Quays there, I also took the boat tour on the river. Lots of food choices and places to relax/socialize. Lots too of activity along the promenades near the river on both sides too. Kind of different during the day and at night, which made for a fun contrast too, both were quite picturesque.

My favorite part is the bridges linking the two sides. Each bridge has its own story and lore; and frankly all are still used often daily now. Kind of the main part of the city for many people, which then links with the Marina Bay also.

Definitely worth checking out from a few different perspectives along the way and at different times during the day/night."
,,Hive of Activity,4.0,,"Lots of choices of places to eat. Hive of activity at night. Beautiful views of the lights. Flat area, easy to walk around and take in the atmosphere."
,,great entertainment,4.0,,"a lively area to visit after a hard day. Literally and food choice you could want. many bars with live entertainment, A constant flow of people can make it a bit challenging, but interesting at the same time. Only flaw is that the Toilets are scarce and not well kept for the amount of people it services."
,,Nice River,4.0,,Nice view with nice Water light festival. Especially at night time. Wow....many light surrounding. nice to make a picture
,,Stunning at night,5.0,,"All along the Singapore river,at all the quays and bays is a fantastic sight and night out. There are so many eating options at restaurants and bars all within walking distance of each quay ( if you're up to it). The night sky looks beautiful with all the lights lit up in the hotels etc. There are also little river cruises at a reasonable price if you just want to cruise along."
,,Walk till you drop,4.0,,"This is a nice place to literally walk till you drop admiring the skyline of this city state passing by the few historic bridges like the Cavenagh , Elgin, Ord, Read bridges. You get a totally different view of the city skyline especially at night."
,,Beautiful Architecture and Fun Atmosphere,5.0,,Walking along the river is a magical experience especially at night. You are spoiled for choice with all of the international restaurants which line the banks. Have a nice drink or meal and watch the world go by.
,,Romandic amazing cruise,5.0,,"We went to Clarke Quay. There is a pier there and you can take small ship - bambore to go for cruise. Go night, the view of the building, the restaurands, the hotels, the Marina Bay Sands, the merlion from the river is amazing."
,,Never crowded,5.0,,It is good to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city by going on the boat. Look out for the sculptures of the children diving into the river. The driver slows down so you can get a photo/selfie.
,,Buzzing at night,5.0,,"Lots of great eateries at any of these quays. Try Boomerang where you can watch the sports, great food at a reasonable price."
,,Night Time is Best,4.0,,This is a short but interesting activity to do when in Singapore. Running commentary as the bumboat passes places of interest is good as you learn a bit of Singapores history. All the coloured lights make the night time cruise more spectacular photo wise and it's a lot cooler.
,,Romantic Wlaking at night,5.0,,always some where special to eat in any of the many restaurants. and plenty of time for romantic walks along the river in the beautiful warm evenings.
,,Take a night stroll.,5.0,,"i took a night stroll, ended up at a great indian eatery, the area is full of life.
you dont need to book just find a place that you like overlooking the river and you will see a mixture of local life blending in with the tourist"
,,Great to stroll around Clarke Quay area,4.0,,"Water cruises, around the Quay Area. Heaps of restaurants for lunch or dinner,
Great viewing from the restaurants while you have a drink & watch the world pass by.
A great tourist area, plenty of places to walk, Best in the evenings with entertainment, a real magnet for people visiting Singapore Downtown."
,,Very good way to spend an evening in Singapore,4.0,,We went to the Clarke Quay area. There are a lot of restaurants and bars by the river and if you look closely you can find a good range of vegan options to nibble along with your drink. Great place to have a nice conversation.
,,A lazy way to sightseeing,5.0,,"SIngapore is great place for walking. The downtown area is pretty central and pleasant to either stroll or more power walking. But taking the river cruise, you slow things down, and see the side of the city in a different light and speed. It was a short ride of one hour and during the day, though the breeze is nice, the heat will quickly make the open deck behind pretty challenging. But at night, lo and behold, the lights and its reflections on the water is one of the sight worth memorizing."
,,Best asset for tourists!,4.0,,"The river provides the tourist with a variety of combinations to provide things to do. Water cruises available from Clarke's Quay running through the center of the city. Restaurants offering great food and drink along the river. Great entertainment along the river. Terrific views, photo taking and people watching from the river. River conveniently runs to a good portion of the city providing a great asset for the city and tourist."
,,Riverboat Cruise,5.0,,"went on 2 cruises. one cost $25 per person and went from Clarke Quay past MerLion and Marina Bay Sands. Great audio tour guide to explain buildings and history. 2nd cruise for laser light show at cost of $38 per person. BEST WAY to see the light show at Marina Bay Sands at Night...no crowds, no pushing and shoving and THE BEST VIEW"
,,Great nights entertainment,4.0,,"A guided tour up the Singapore river was truly a good experience, learnt a lot about the history of Singapore."
,,Singapore visit,2.0,,Not much to do you just take pictures. It really is not fun but it was ok. I mean noting to do there just sightseeing.
,,A great location for a stroll after dark!,4.0,,"We have walked along the banks of the Singapore River on a number of occasions during various visits to Singapore. We have found that it is better to take walks along the river bank paths after dark. It can be unpleasantly hot and steamy during the daylight hours.
During our most recent stay in Singapore, we took a long walk around the Clarke Quay area during the early hours of the evening. It was great to see people out enjoying the vibrant atmosphere and the sights and lights along the river.
If you are after a walk in a quieter area, you can head further up the river past Robertson Quay which tends to be more of a residential area and consequently much quieter."
,,Nice views of Singapore,4.0,,"We had a riverside room at Park Hotel Clarke Quay, so waking up to the sights of the river, and going to sleep with all the lights around it, pretty much made our day. Walking down the riverfront areas and the river cruise added to our pleasurable experience of living by the Singapore River."
,,A lovely night view,4.0,,Its a little expensive but something you only do once. The views are amazing and its a good quick tour
,,Worth A Walk Or Boat Trip,4.0,,"We started our walk in Robertson Quay and walked almost to the Bay area. Make sure you have plenty of water or take a boat as an alternative. There are shopping malls, bridges to cross, restaurants and good walkways so we found it an interesting few hours.
Boat Quay didn't have much open as we were there in the morning and is more of a night place from what we were told. We were pleased we took the time to look at this area."
,,Pleasant area,5.0,,Just so pleasant to walk along the river paths.Many areas to stop for refreshments mainly after noon.Recommend taking River Cruise.Clarke Quay or Fort Canning.$25 for 40min informative cruise.Excellent photo opportunity.
,,modern river,4.0,,Singapore river is very modern! You will see so may buildings along the river and those buildings are lit up at night. Boat tour is available.
,,Excellent,4.0,,"The areas of Clarke Quay & Robertson Quay are excellent. Clarke Quay is a complete party area with restaurants & riverside cafes, music , bands & dance going on in the evenings. Theres also a ride for the adventurous.
Robertsonson Quay has these little cafes by the river which we often visit for breakfast."
,,Beautiful walk worth doing,4.0,,"Robertson Quays, clarke Singapore waterfront was really enjoyable. Plenty of nice places to eat , boat ride, the atomosphere in Singapore is amazing. Very friendly people all willing to assist you whenever. Oh so clean and tidy."
,,Great Way To See The City,4.0,,"The Singapore River is a lovely focal point for the city. It has some lovely quays like Clarke and in particular Boat Quay that have great energy, nightlife and make for lovely places to eat by day. Much of the river is flanked by a promenade/walkway and I realky enjoyed using it despite thecsearing heat!
The old fashioned wooden 'bumboats"" trundle along offering tours and I'd recommend those too as it is a really relaxing way to see the city and much cooler than walking.
Singapore is a city made by it's seafront and riverfront so make sure you spend a bit of time by the water, it is a lovely part of the city."

,,River of life.,5.0,,"SINGAPORE RIVER

The Singapore River is approximately 3.2 kilometers long from its current source at Kim Seng Bridge to where it empties into Marina Bay, after Anderson Bridge. When the building of the Barrage at the seaward mouth of Marina Bay is completed a reservoir was formed with the Kallang River and Singapore River both empting it waters into the Bay. Hence both rivers stop receiving tides from the sea. The Barrage also controls flood water from the two rivers in cases of heavy downpour.

The Singapore River may be a short river but it has a history of importance since the days of its founding of modern Singapore, by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1918. What Raffles founded was a good safe harbor with trade soon blossom with the River playing an important part in the landing of lighters bringing goods from ships to its quays. With the construction of the Port of Singapore and the introduction of containers the River soon lost it’s importance as a landing for goods.

By then the River had been over polluted with waste, sludge and oil deposits by boats, and slit. It was smelly and an eye-sore. Lee Kuan Yew the then Prime Minister then threw a challenge to the authorities to clean up the River and to have fish swimming in it one day. Today there are fresh water fishes in the two rivers.

Today the River is clean. Good landscaping and proper planning of the surroundings make the banks a vibrant avenue of restaurants, hotels, banks, and shops. Many 4 to 5 stars hotels such as the Fullerton Hotel, the Novotel, Four Horizons, Holiday Inn, and the iconic Marina Sands Hotel, are here. Many old warehouses were redeveloped and repainted into hotels, restaurants, shops and night clubs. The river cruise program is very popular with the tourist especially the evening cruises.

I had no trouble walking without interruption of vehicle, using the Park Connector (Promenade), from the source at Kim Seng Bridge to its mouth in 55 minutes. The Park Connector is also a good place to jog and I found many expatriates running alongside me.

The actual founding of Singapore was by a Sumatran Prince, Sang Nila Utama, who upon landing on the banks of the River and seeing an animal that looked like a lion, to him, he name the place Singapura, meaning Lion City. In the days of Raffles, The Singapore River was filled with sand bars, salt marshes and mangrove swamps. The River then flowed from Fort Canning Hills and from the marshes behind Kim Seng Bridge, in Havelock area. The Black Bridge was found in this area. In those days bridges was name by color, namely the White Bridge, the Green Bridge and the Black Bridge. The Read Bridge, which was also called the Green Bridge because of its color, is located in Clark Quay, was originally built in 1889, and was named after William Henry Macleod Read. Bridges have their history too. Kim Seng Bridge is named after Tan Kim Seng a wealthy merchant from Malacca who was well known for his donation to the people suffering from various draughts in Singapore. It is interesting to note that the bridge nearby, Jiak Kim Bridge, was named after Kim Seng’s grandson Tan Jiak Kim. Jiak Kim was the founder member of the Straits Chinese British Association and a Legislative Member for 16 years."

The river walk is a beauty and in the mornings are filled with walkers, joggers, families and those pesky silent electric scooters. Restaurants abound along the area with such an array of food and nightlife. We could walk to Orchard Road, Little India and Chinatown. The place is so central with good access to public transport and the MRT and the Fort Canning MRT to open soon.

We really enjoyed visiting day but also at night."
,,Clip Joints,3.0,,"We walked beside the river at Robertson Quays and reviewed the restaurants and prices there. It appeared that these eating houses were occupied mainly with expats happy to pay the high prices.
In a city known for the competitive prices and gourmet meals this area was a complete contradiction.
The walkway is continually used by expats and their motorised scooters weaving through the walkers. These scooter riders are the latest fad from the well heeled young expats."

,,Short and Uneventful riverboat cruise,3.0,,Tickets cost $25 Singapore for adult and $15 for child. Price of tickets is only for the boat ride- does not include any cold drink or chips. Ice cream is not permitted on board. The tour guide is a recording at least the voice has a neutral accent and in English. The boat we used was clean and there were enough life vests for the passengers. I cannot tell if they had life vests for children though. There was even a poster on how to put on a life vest and how to generally be safe in the boat. Good for kids and picture taking of the different buidlings. Very short cruise- 40 mins.
,,Best city,5.0,,Went to a Thailand for our honeymoon and on the way back our stop over at Singapore airport was 10 hours. So we decided to have a tour of the city which is free and runs every hour or so from and to the airport and you will have a guide that takes you through the city. Singapore river and marina was really nice. Everyone should plan at least once a visit to Singapore.
,,Hot night spot,4.0,,"All along the riverfront, there are restaurants, pubs, hotels, ice cream vendors, nightclubs, and fun things like river boat cruises, and carnival type rides. After dinner hours the pubs & nightclubs heat up and there are lots of people & couples out partying. Some nights there are open air concerts. Prices reflect that a lot of tourists come here!"
,,A MUST DO,5.0,,"Fabulous restaurants all along the esplanade. Stunning at night with the daily laser show and it's well worth taking a boat trip especially right at the end of the night, very romantic."
,,Beauty at night,4.0,,"There is a lovely walk along the river which we have done in the daytime and evening. We prefer the evening because the bridges are all lit up. Plus lots of people listening to street musicians, eating, drinking etc. Out for a good time. Bring your camera."
,,Magical by day or night,5.0,,"Boat ride by day, walked the Esplanade and Boat Quay by day and night. It was magical. WE had dinner at a fabulous restaurant (Wakanui) on Boat Quay ... one of the most enjoyable dinners I have ever had at a restaurant overall, and I have eaten all over the world. Seeing a city from the river banks gives a different perspective, an insight into local culture that you don't always see from the main drags. So if you want to relax, wind down, enjoy, take a stroll ... cooler at night, but cool to do any time."

,,Lively riverfront,5.0,,"Along Boat Quay there are many places to eat and drink with excellent pubs and really good food, alcohol is not however particularly cheap. Boat Quay is very popular with the workers from the nearby offices and can get busy at lunchtimes so aim to get there before 1pm. It is very lively in the evenings and is a pleasant place to dine relatively inexpensively. There is a vast choice of Western, local, Korean and Japanese restaurants all converted from the original warehouses and some exhibiting the lobster, crab or fish alive in tanks awaiting the customers choice. Clarke Quay just upriver is another lively spot and would get the teen vote as a vibrant nightspot on the far side opposite Clarke is the G-Max reverse bungy swing."

It's really cooling to sit at the deck outside. Alternatively, you can choose to sit by the river at Clarke Quay, just outside The Central. (There's free music from the bars nearby ;))"
,,Happing place,4.0,,"Definitely there are many places along the rive like Robertson Quay and Clarke Quay that have tons of restaurants and bars.

Great selection and choices for dining and drinking.

Many have views of the river/quays form which you can watch the tour boats, all lit up, ply back and forth. It is also very tranquil in places and some people just sit and relax and enjoy the views (beautiful buildings, sky line and river scenes; including the light displays i.e. the brides are lit up and change colours and there are some laser lights into the night sky). Maybe not the place if you are on a strict budget, but you don't have to spend to enjoy it. I could return time and time again!"

,,Entertaining evening,4.0,,"We were fortunate enough to stay walking distance to the river walk. What a fun area. It was a lively night time destination. There are numerous places to eat, drink, and listen to live music. It is not cheap. All the restaurants were pretty pricey. The nice thing is the selection of options, however they are all pricey. The area was well lit, safe, and full of people having good times."
,,Best rest place after a long night walk in Singapore,5.0,,Having walked around the Marina Bay in the night we joined Singapore River from Bonham Street close to the backside of Fullerton Hotel.

You can take a cruise along the river, or just wander along -- it's busy both day and night and every day of the week. This one of the MUST-VISIT places in Singapore; have you been there?"
,,Birthday trip,5.0,,Beautiful by the quays our favourite being Clarke Quay. Lovely to walk along by the river and then sit and enjoy lunch and a drink watching the works go by.
,,A day out on the river,5.0,,"We started our journey from Clarke Quay making our way up the river passing Boat Quay Jetty, Fullerton Jetty, Merlion Park Jetty and Bayfront South Jetty all the while taking many pics of the beautiful view of the passing buildings and hotels. Marina Bay Sands was a place to see and the Merlion Park. You can see many other tourist taking pictures near the lion which is the iconic feature for the passing boats. Then making our way back from Marina Bay to Esplanade Jetty and then to Clarke Quay. All in all the journey was for 40min. After you can go and enjoy your free milkshake or original Buffalo wings from ""Billy Bombers American diner."
,,lovely walks,5.0,,Singapore is a walking city and following the Quays is a good way to see it at its best.very relaxing and a good way to absorb the history
,,Daily Walking Around,4.0,,It's good activity for you and your kids walking beside the river enjoying the weather and the beautiful view around
,,HISTORY AND COLOUR,5.0,,Where to start the briges are awesome and old but well kept. The stalls and resturants exceptional. Thou the prices are a bit steep
,,A pleasant afternoon spot,4.0,,"By chance I had stumbled on this spot after going on the Singapore Flyer and waiting to go to Altitude One close by. A dragon boat race was in full swing with large number of corporate teams emblazoned in team colour vying for the honours.

Adjacent to the river are loads of small bars, cafés and restaurants. A small street stuffed with milling pedestrians runs between the two and most bars have their outdoor seating on the river side.

A lovely feel, peaceful and fun. Made me think, ""Well done Singapore!"""
,,Lunch and a lovely leisurely walk - perfect!,5.0,,"What more could you ask for during a holiday and a break away from busy life. We had lunch at one of the cafes at Boat Quay, then wondered around, walked over the bridge and under the huge 'umbrella'. Leisurely, peaceful."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"No trip to Singapore is complete without a stroll along one of several popular quays alongside the Singapore River.
We stayed at the Park Hotel, Clarke Quay and walked from Robertson Quay, farthest upstream, down to Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and to Merlion Park.
Whatever the time of day there is something of interest to spot, from the colourful bumboats to interesting sculptures and statues dotted along the bank. In the evening, the lights of the skyscrapers sparkle in the sky and the restaurants and bars lining the river start to fill up.
A highlight of the city."
,,Good running course for the early morning business traveller,4.0,,If you are staying in the city in Singapore a run along the river in the morning can get the blood pumping and energy levels up for the day. A run from Robertson Quay to Clarke quay and past the Fullerton for a lap of the Marina Bay is a good loop for about a 5km run. The morning views of the Marina Bay give a different perspective of a city known for its night lights. For those with more energy run back to Robertson Quay and continue on to Tiong Bahru and treat yourself to a Sugar Cane Juice with lemon at the Hawker centre before heading back.
,,our holiday,5.0,,This is where we stay. We enjoy this area as it has so much night life and entertainment. The access to all these areas is very easy and very safe.
,,It's a river....,4.0,,"Actually that's not fair, it runs through the centre of Singapore and has interesting and attractive walks along side. Start at Clarke Quay and walk towards the Bay, about 90 minutes, or better still take a trip on a river cruise and get out on the water. Boat Quay is worth a visit late afternoon as most bars have happy hour making a drink more affordable so you could sit and watch activity on the river and on the promenade, nice."
,,Restaurant by the river,3.0,,"The river area kind like standard setup for me. Lots of restaurant by the river. Both side are busy. There are also river tour whic ih make more busy. Its look beautiful at night as the lighting bring more ambience.
Lots of different restaurant available for us to choose. Must come a bit early as most of the table are full.
Must come to this place and have dinner by the river."

,,Daytime or Nighttime attraction,4.0,,"This sightseeing boat cruise along the Singapore River is a brief interesting, relaxing journey through the heart of Singapore.

You can buy there various souvenirs in the small kiosks. Do not forget to stop there during your visit to Singapore. It is simply an unforgettable experience!
,,Stayed right alongside the river.,5.0,,I love Singapore River. It is a lovely place for a pleasant stroll and for picking out which of many restaurants and bars you want to visit. We are good walkers so we walked all the way from Clarke Quay to Marina Bay Sands easy to do if you are a walker.
,,holiday,4.0,,That was an awesome place we did a boat rip on the river and at night walked all along Clarkes Quay to find an eating place. There is a huge variety to choose from from budget to high end. felt very safe walking round there
,,Take a ride on the river,4.0,,"Take a 45 minute boat along the river, you will see a lot. Great views of some of the high rise buildings. Many restaurants to choose from on the river. Much more action at night though we were there in the day time."
,,Another way to see Singapore,5.0,,Easy boat ride with commentary along the water. We travelled from Robertson Quay to Marina Bay Sands. Great breezy cruise and learn about the river history of Singapore. Put it on the list as a must do
,,Take a fun walk,5.0,,"Clean and wonderful walking trails, this river is full of places to eat and shop. The boats on the river are electric, so no noise or pollution, safe sidewalks, and good lighting abound."
,,A Walk Through the City,4.0,,"Nice place to walk and see a different side of Singapore, through the old godowns alongside the river converted to restaurants, shops and pubs. All pubs and restaurants on the riverbank offers a good view of the city, though the prices are rather high. The nightview is simply more magical, though you may see more in the daytime. Good for photography!

Note: You can take the River Taxi (quite dear though, 40mins ride), or walk along the banks and see the tranformation Singapore has taken through its massive skyscrappers and well lit skylines. Cooler to walk in the late afternoon (morning is fine, but shops are closed)."
,,boat trip,4.0,,enjoyable boat trip in excellent condition boat .I believe it would be a good idea to expand the boating experience to being ferries from Clarkes Quay to the Bay and possibly Sentosa island if feasible .
,,Very Pretty,4.0,,Walked her during the day and night and everywhere you turn something different. Great place to also look back at the City Skyline.
,,Great photos from here,5.0,,If you like photo opportunities there are none better than Singapore from the river. So many different views of the familiar landmarks make this a definite for your Singapore stay.
,,A quick excellent tour by river.,5.0,,"The views from the boat were breathtaking. The skyscrapers, bridges and other buildings as seen from the river must be one of the best ways to see this lovely city."
,,"Very scenic, with numerous bars and eateries!",4.0,,"This is an area we always visit, offering good views day or night. Of course any of these quays are much quieter in the daytime, and really come alive after dark. Bum boat trips can be taken from a number of ticket places and certainly a worthwhile experience."
,,The river flows through the city,4.0,,"I expect this river was originally used as a transport link from the sea , but now it is used more to entertain. There are lots of places to eat and drink around the quays, but they come alive during the evening.
There is a water taxi service available during the day"
,,A wonderful place you can not miss if you are in Singapore,5.0,,"Walk along the Jubilee walk along the bridge and see the glorious Fullerton Hotel and building, the impressive financial district of Singapore and the wonderful Museum of Asian civilizations.
You will also see an array of restaurants along the river offering traditional dishes and the traditional chilli crab.
Cross the river near the Fullerton hotel and you will arrive to the beautiful monument of the Victoria Theathre and the concert hall as well as Raffles statue."

,,nice place to walk around,4.0,,I like this place in Singapore. It has nice view and many restaurants . You can relax there deinking beer or Singapore sling and looking at river... Don't go there if you are in hurry. Just relax and watch...

,,A fantastic night time spot.,5.0,,"Great location with plenty of restaurants to choose from. Well lit, colourful and we felt extremely safe wandering here at night."
,,The heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Love the area around Clarke and Robertson Quays. The place comes alive at night with all the bars and restaurants swathed in bright colour, but a stroll along the riverbank during the day is also rewarding. If nothing else take a rest by the Riverbank and watch the world float by - better still take a short cruise on a riverboat."
,,take a boat ride,4.0,,too appreciate the river you should take a boat tour. it's not one of the worlds great rivers but its still lovely
,,Singapore River,4.0,,this is a great way to relax and enjoy some of the traditional sights and history of Singapore in years gone by.
,,The most happening place in singapore,5.0,,"Go there when you have finished your day's shopping and attractions. I would recommend a boat ride costing S$ 25.00 per person/40mins. In the LIGHTS you will find the neighbourhoods most charming and awesome when you are in the boat. Be ready to take a lot of pictures.Immense food and drink varieties of all brands with great outdoor seatings... May try the Sea food restaurants on the edge of the river. This place is open till 4AM. Saturdays they have special street shows. Inspite of all the crowds the place is very safe. Ask for the RIVERSIDE FRONT or CLARK QUAY. MUST,MUST, visit."
,,Casual Walk,5.0,,Regularly visit Singapore and always stay at a hotel nearby the river as this is where all the action is at night.
,,"Must see, especially at night",4.0,,The night time views are spectacular especially if viewed from the river on one of the many cruises (Clarke quay). Plenty of night life: bars and restaurants etc. The cruises end at the area around Marina Bay Sands/ DNA bridge and if you are lucky you may see a laser light show. Daytime roaming in Robertson quay: there are sufficient bars/restaurants for lunch time drinks and snacks.
,,Very Busy,4.0,,"The number of boats plying this river way is unbelievable.Even though traffic flow is unlbelievably heavy, it is orderly, and great to wittness."

,,A must....,5.0,,"We have visited Singapore a number of times and taken the now obligatory boat trip from Clarke Quay around the Marina and back on a number of occasions and each time it feels different.

This time we were staying in Singapore over New Year and left the boat cruise until the afternoon at the end of over trip before leaving for the airport. It was a very pleasant way of saying goodbye and enjoying seeing the ever changing Singapore skyline from a different perspective at a very leisurely pace.

We went for a boat with a large open area at the rear of the deck to get the best views and were rewarded.

We had also visited the Sky Park above the Marina Bay which gives you a bird’s eye perspective which contrasts really well with the fish eye perspective provided by the boat.

Another thing of note was the number of boats that left Clarke Quay to see the fireworks in the Bay – they were packed but once again I am not sure how good a view you would have had from inside the boat.

Day or night trips – we have done both – completely different perspectives – both are just as good if you are a fan of Singapore architecture – thank you"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The whole river front is a visual spectacular both in the daylight and at nigh time. Restaurants, local traders (try the coconut ice cream) It is very clean and safe so take in the sights and enjoy!!"
,,Site and sounds of Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore has a vibrant nightlife as well as plenty to do in the day. Boat, Clarke and Robertson Quays have great rstaurants, night clubs and a beautiful place to chill out during the day."
,,Took a bum boat tour of the river,4.0,,We rode a bum boat on the river and had a tour. Lovely and breezy and something you have to do when at Clarke Quay. Quite enjoyable viewing the buildings and quays from the water.
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,"This is a great spot night or day but I think the best time is at night as the river is literally at it's best to get the chance to see the best of lights every where.
First have a great Seafood dinner at jumbo restaurant and then go across the walking bridge and get a boat around the river where you can get a great look at Singapore attractions.
Next when you get back to the jetty make sure you have a tricycle bike ride which great fun way to get around.Also go into orchard road in the end of November the street is decorated up with Christmas spirit every where.. Fabulous."
,,Good way to see the sights,4.0,,The trip we took on a bum boat was part of an organized visit and we loved seeing the sights from a different view point than by taxi.
,,A relaxing way to see older parts of the city,5.0,,What a great break if you're walking around up near the Old Fullerton (great buffet lunch) and harbour - it takes about an hour and you get a good view of parts of the river and the Colonial buildings. Cool and relaxing. Also fits in if you intend to go over to marina Bay Sands in the arvo.
,,Fantasic food & entertainemnt area along river!,5.0,,"Allow plenty of time to explore and pick your dinner place wisely. Very busy every day of the week, with some great music venues, too. Walk both sides and enjoy the views or even a boat trip!"
,,This river has come a long way!,4.0,,"This is the place where the early ancestors came in through bump boats and landed on the island. This is also the place where sir Stamford raffles landed. Beholding the transformation is amazing. I still remember when I was younger, the river was so smelly and dirty due to the early trading activities that were carried out along this river. Think in the 80s, Mr Lee Kuan Yew started cleaning this river up and transformed it into what it is today; amazing!"
,,You can get everywhere via the river - river cruise best at night,4.0,,Singapore River is the heart of Singapore. Everything can be seen along its banks and there are walkways on both sides. Singapore River Cruise is very pleasant and better at night when the lights are stunning.
,,A perfect photo stop,5.0,,"The promenade area along the Singapore River are perfect photo stops to any visitors and tourists who need a signature Singapore backdrop.

My wife and I took the MRT and we alighted at the Raffles Place station (east west line). After breakfast at a cafe at Raffles Place, we took a leisurely stroll towards the River, via the historic Fullerton Hotel.

This is also the financial centre and a bustling place with people walking past in super high speed.

The promenade areas had a few historic buildings that were beautifully restored such as the Fullerton Hotel, Victoria Concert Hall, ACM, National Gallery. During our visit, there were a few large shiny balls displayed in the park outside the Asian Civilisation Museum. They make for a fun place to do a jumping shot."
,,Take A Singapore River Boat Ride - But Also Walk A Lot,5.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited Singapore in June 2016. You can get to the river by going from Raffles Place through the UOB Atrium to the promenade on the river. I would go right and walk to the Fullerton Hotel which is a very fancy hotel to walk around in. From there you can go to underground moving sidewalks and get to the Merlion Park. At the Merlion Park you can get a Singapore River boat ride. The boat ride lasts an hour and you can see the Singapore River, Clarke Quay, Marina Bay, the Singapore sky line, the Marina Bay Sands and many other things. I would also like to add that before entering the Fullerton Hotel you can also turn left and cross a foot bridge. On the other side are many things like the Asia Civilization Museum and the Raffles Statue. I think you can spend a few hours here overall between walking and the boat ride and possibly dinner."
,,The lifeline..,5.0,,"My personal opinion is that the river as well as the river banks are the lifeline of Singapore. Soothing, but exciting at the same time. You can either take a leisurely walk along the sides, or step into a swanky pub / restaurant for an utterly satisfying meal.

Don't miss it. Especially areas like Clarke Quay / Boat Quay etc which offer the best of both worlds. I highly recommend a boat tour of the river in the evening when the city comes alive with its lights in full glory."
,,Take a walk or do it by boat,4.0,,There is so much to see in this area that using a canal boat is a good way to do it. Then walk the parts you want to. The river/canal footpaths are very good.
,,Best done in the evenings,5.0,,"I always tell visitors to Singapore to do this en route to a visit to Clarke/Boat Quay for drinks or for a meal. Taking one of the boat tours in the evening in good weather would mean a nice gentle breeze, beautiful colors in the skies and being able to observe modern city life along the Singapore River."
,,nice,5.0,,good to see the sight seen and also the arch. they have build near by and in night it was looking very nice and good time to visit in moderate weather and also on new year

,,Must Visit to See most of the Famous part of Singapore from Boat..,5.0,,"In this 30 to 45 Min Boat, you will see most of the famous thing of Singapore, Worth taking boat ride for sure..

,,Relaxing,4.0,,"Lovely slow ride down the river to marina bay. Just one point , if you buy the 40 minute ticket they don't let you off at the quay drop off's marked on the map they provide. Ask before purchasing if you want to get off."
,,Long walk with scenic views,3.0,,Long walk with scenic views best done in the evenings when it is cooler. Restaurants and bars offer lots of dinning options. Visit converted warehouses and go-downs or take a relaxing boat cruise.
,,"lots of bars places to eat, peaceful and relaxing area, and much space to relax",4.0,,"Hotels along this area are the quiet good views of Singapore. Raffles is nearby, as well as many other choices but Singapore remains expensive 3-4 times that of some European cities for hotel rooms. Areas like the river, make taking a good base 3 star (eg Ibis), and eat and be outside along this area. Location means much for access so try to get a hotel with access to here."
,,Get on a bike and cruise along,5.0,,"I strongly recommend to book a bike tour to see Boat,Clark and Roberson Quay!! Too long to walk all of it. Absoluetly loved cruising along the river during day time and returning for drinks in the evening!"
,,Night Life at the best,5.0,,"This place is a must visit for people who want to enjoy the night life of Singapore, lots of restaurants, Pubs & eateries. Not advisable for family with Kids as this place is full of smoke & liquor."
,,Memories,5.0,,"This was my go to place in Singapore on Friday evenings and weekends. Take a drink and then sit and chill by the riverside like everyone does. There is no better feeling. You can see lot of couples along the riverside. It is an ideal place to sit, relax and also observe the nightlife of Singapore. You can also hear loud music from clubs nearby which dares you from a distance."
,,"So much to see, do, explore and enjoy AND eat",5.0,,From Robertson Quay all the way through to Merlion Park the Singapore River offers every cuisine imaginable plus ready access to museums such as the Asian Civilizations Museum. Along the way there are some fun sculptures and pieces of history such as the Cavendish Bridge. Great for walking or boat tours.

Visited lots of attractions near this river: Parks, Asian Civilizations Museum (Free inDecember 2016), Victoria Cultural Center, Supreme Court, statue of Raffles, Obelisk, etc.

There is a paved walkway that I used to walk along this river. Benches and chairs are available for one's use. Enjoyed the group of playful statues located along this river.

Highly recommended! Note that the Marina Bay attractions are located about 5-10 minutes away from this river. Enjoy!"
,,A lovely 40 minute boat ride on the Singapore River,5.0,,A relaxing boat ride with great views of this amazing city. $25.00 per adult. There is a recorded narration that gives much information
,,Trip round Singapore's largest reservoir,3.0,,An interesting 30 minutes but rather expensive for what it was.The boat just chugged around the bay but with an interesting commentary on various historical sites
,,"Stroll The Banks, Follow The River, Breathe In The Sights",5.0,,"A fairly long stretch. Better to venture out in the evening.

Go downs and warehouses converted to commercial use - think pubs, grills, restaurants. Where once bum boats ply, coolies toil, and trade thrived.. now people watchers bum around, cool cats enjoy and commerce is upbeat.

Colonial period buildings line the riverside - bridges too. See pics attached to get a feel of the place."
,,"Not to miss, if you haven't been there!",4.0,,"An unmissable thing to see. You can see the river at Merlion, Boat Quay or Clarke Quary. You can also see from Flyer.

The water is a bit muddy. Better way to enjoy the river is with River cruise ride or walking along it at Clarke Quay/ Boat Quay.

Time required: 10 mins to 1 hr, depends how much time you want to spend.
Recommended in evening or night time only."

,,The River view,4.0,,"This is a bit of a long walk to go around from Raffles to Marina Bay sands but is a scenic view, clean and lots of people taking pictures of the Merlion in front of Fullerton.

,,A Must Do,5.0,,This is a very good way to start your tour of Singapore. It is a narrated trip that goes all the way around the river. The architecture was very enjoyable and you get familiar with many of the other areas like Clarke Quay where there are many restaurants and other sights..
,,Unmissable,5.0,,"The 40 minute cruise starting from Clarke Quay is good value for the $25 ticket. The queue and boarding are somewhat haphazard and the staff handling this chore sport permanently bored expressions. However, once you get on board, the route taken gives you fine views of Clarke Quay,Boat Quay, Marina Bay and its surrounding buildings, a mixture of old and new, including of-course Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion as well as fine colonial buildings like the Victoria theatre and concert hall, the ACM building etc. The accompanying commentary is good."

,,Singapore by the river ! Fascinating sites and view transformations,4.0,,"The cruise takes you along the river. It takes 40 minutes for one entire trip. For people who are short on time and cannot walk, the singapore riveer cruise links all the locations besides the river. I would recommend using the cruise service as it becomes like a hop on/off type of sightseeing and you can enjoy the different views and highlights of singapore."
,,A calm & quiet ride,4.0,,"The ride we took started from Clark Quay and it was a very peaceful sway in the river, if I may call it. The historic events are explained in English, while we were passing the places. The next time when I passed those places, I had a different perspective of looking at those places. It was drizzling while we took the ride but as the boat was covered it was a pleasant weather & journey"
,,Take a boat ride,5.0,,From Clarke Quay and hear the story of Singapore from the river. It is a good thing to before lunch fx.

,,Things changed,4.0,,"25 years ago it used to be a much nicer and cleaner place. I still enjoyed walking around there and hitting the bars, but it is not the same bling. If you like lively eateries with good drinks and views this is the place to go. In the evening it gets quite noisy."

,,Great spot to walk,4.0,,"Easy walk along river with tourist or local options available for food, sights and shopping.

,,Great River Cruise,4.0,,"This is a great way to see different parts of Singapore in a very relaxing way. It costs Singapore $25 per person and you can board at several points along the cruise . The cruise takes you all around Marina bay and the Helix Bridge,under Jubilee and Anderson Bridges to the Fullerton Hotel on to Elgin Bridge and Colman Bridge to Clarke Quay and Riverside Point with full commentary then back the same way ,but on the opposite side of the river and the commentary is then for that side.

,,day and night trips,5.0,,"You need to take a boat ride or duck boat ride, to enjoy the views from the Singapore river. The river is natural, not choppy and safe for the kids.

Very touristy and is highly recommended to go. Top of the list in Singapore, even for repeat in my next trip to the island nation."
,,River Gave Rise to Great City,4.0,,"Modern Singapore City owes its existence to the Singapore River. Because of its sheltered nature, the mouth of the river became the natural choice for the establishment of a port - the Port of Singapore, and this became the centre of trade, commerce and finance.

Thus grew the City of Singapore, particularly after Singapore was ceded to the British and the arrival of Sir Stanford Raffles, whose engineers drew up plans for the long term development and growth of the City.

Singapore River is just three kilometers long from its source at Kim Seng Bridge until it empties into the Ocean at Marina Bay."

Along Clarkes Quay its full of bars, restaurants, live music, great atmosphere, nice, friendly people, no drunks, and just a lovely place to walk along enjoying the reflection of the numerous lights in the river water. So maybe that how you review a river. Worth a walk!!"
,,Best place to be,4.0,,"Having visited Singapore a couple of times now, I found the Quays the best place to be. With a large and wide range of restaurants and bars, the opportunity to soak in the atmosphere and people watch is fabulous. I have walked the Quays many times and at night, the water lights up with boats, etc. Very pleasant"
,,Continues to a part of my Singapore visits,4.0,,"I stayed one night in Robertson Quay. Walk from there into the CBD via Clarke Quay and Boat Quay is a pleasure - plenty of shade along the river bank, with the first section lined with restaurants & bars. Robertson Quay is home to a large expatriate community."
,,Great places to eat & drink,4.0,,"The riverwalk is a really good walk and introduction to Singapore. Takes you from Robertson quay with its hotels and quieter bars and restaurants to Clarke Quay with the wide selection of eating places and bars along to Boat Quay with the impressive skyline and, this being Singapore, its own selection of restaurants and watering holes along the quayside.

On the other side of Boat Quay is some of the more historical landmarks of Singapore, and a nice place to sit and watch the world go by.

Had the pleasure of a quiet sunny Sunday morning strolling the riverwalk after a leisurely breakfast outside (under a fan) in Robertson Quay, and would highly recommend it!

Just keep an eye out for the joggers, cyclists and electric scooters..."
,,Touristy,3.0,,"It's very touristy, but who can resist a Singapore sling down by the waters edge. It's a mix of the old Singapore and the cheap plasticky/ futuristic world of architecture that seems to be so popular . It's probably better to buy a carry out and find a nice bench to sit on and chat with the locals. That's what did on the 2nd night."
,,Dinner on the River,5.0,,Dinner at Rosso Vino on the River was very relaxing. Less noise than Orchard Road. Great place for a stroll on the river walkway.
,,Ok,4.0,,Singapore river is the newest attraction does singapore have. It attracts me the panda but sad to say they close earlier than 6. Though they have a great location and attraction.

The commentary was great, telling you all the history along the river. It was so relaxing and entertaining. I highly recommend this, even in the rain."
,,Nice way to spend some time.,4.0,,I did this boat ride last year and it was very nice and relaxing. The boat makes its way from Clarke Quay down the river and past the Merlion statue in the bay before going past the waterfront promenade and back the the Quay. It was also very informative with the tour guide pointing out interesting facts along the way. I would recommend this tour to anyone young or old.
,,BE PREPARED FOR A CHANGE,5.0,,"since last time we went to Singapore over 4 years ago , the Clarke Quays has changed so much with lots of new restaurants, shops and many many new coffee shops. it was a great walk at night as everything is lit up and looks fantastic. Love the atmospher of live music and smell of different foods."
,,Enjoyed the Water / River Taxi and the Riverfront walk,4.0,,"We enjoyed the walk along the riverside and the river cruise that we caught from the Merlion Jetty point. While we did not cruise the entire river, we opted for the water taxi which was a great way to see the same sights at a much lower price than the more touristy river cruise. All in all quite enjoyable."
,,Best scene on a barmy night,5.0,,"Although you can never escape the ultra-modern high rise Singapore, visiting the Singapore River area of the City, at night, with the lights of the bridges and the heritage buildings that line it all illuminated, is almost another world. Blank out the high rise buildings behind the river front, and you can almost be taken back to Singapore in the 1960's and 70's"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"Get a boat, but do your research as the prices could vary a lot. The view is amazing, make sure your camera is ready. Start at Clarke Quay and end it at the Marina Bay Sands. I prefer this route."
,,Night Cruise,5.0,,We cruised down the Singapore River at night as apart of our Chinatown Trishaw tour and it was a lovely end to the day. It was a clear night and it was lovely to see the city from this perspective. The colours and lights and contrasts of the new and old parts of the city were enjoyable. Recommend
,,Connections,5.0,,By taking a boat ride on the River you get a real view of how Singapore has everything closer than it seems. It is worth your money to take the boat ride all along the river and see how you are only steps away from the next attraction. The river Taxi were very nice to use as well. You must make a plan of where you are going to start and where you end. Make sure it is close to your hotel. At the end of the day those last steps seem so long.

,,Great walk from Kings Centre (hotel Furama Riverside) to Marina Bay,4.0,,I wanted to fight the jet lag on the day I arrived in Singapore. So walked from Kings Centre to Marina Bay one side of the river then back the other side. Was hot and long but worth it.really interesting walk - great sights and plenty of stop off places for drinks etc. Really good restaurants on the banks - apart from the old Chinese area which are totally touristy and not good
,,City Lights at Night with a Boat cruise,4.0,,You can see Singapore city just through a boat safari just around 45 minutes . Night time with lights all around it is glorious . For youngsters can have a drink all round the river some part there is lot of resaurants .
,,A good walk,5.0,,"Most people come here from the side approaching the Merlion, but it is worth walking around the River area from the financial district to the Marina Bay Sands. Iconic views from all directions."

,,Just an amazing buzz about the place.,5.0,,Love walking this river from Merlion all the way to Clark Quay. Super clean streets that feel very safe.

,,Love this place,4.0,,You can get on a bumboat for about $25 and go up the river or just walk around have dinner lots of places to eat .A few stalls if you want to buy a gift. A shopping centre you can have a look in to get out of the heat.

Great waterfront dining whatever your mood, and excellent cuisine choices. Enjoy!"
,,Sit back and learn all about Singapore,4.0,,"We went on the bum boat, very good price. The boat went up and down the river pointing out many historical sites and information. It was lovely to sit back and relax on a warm afternoon. Sitting in or outside was equally good."

,,Evening by The River,4.0,,"Visited Singapore River one evening. Walked down and sat by the river bank watching the river boats cruising by, in the setting sun. Many people, visitors and tourists were doing the same thing.

This is the river that has many Singapore Stories. Also the the beginning of the history of modern Singapore. There's 2 portions namely, The Clarke Quay (where I was) and The Boat Quay.

Both quays are filled with many restaurants, cafes, pubs etc. Very colourful and happenings at night. A night entertainment area.

,,Local trip for the highlights of what to visit,4.0,,"The boat trip from the MerLion ferry point on the bumboat was actually very good but not really long enough, and would be better if it could be extended a bit and to go outside the inner harbour a little to the other side of the Marina Sands Hotel, and further up the river to the other end."

They are beautiful during the day too especially the other bank if the river and the lively old buildings and bridges. The fabulous thing about Singapore us that it is SO SO SO safe. People and staff are super friendly and even Australians behave here:-)
,,Beautiful boat rides,4.0,,We took a beautiful boat ride along the river here and got to see the riverbanks and learn of the history of the area. A bit of a dampener when some of the other tourists decided to just crowd where we were seated but the rest of the boat ride was beautiful. One of the highlights of our day.

,,Time Your Boat Trip Right,4.0,,"Our group enjoyed the 45 minute cruise, time to coincide with the Marina Sands light show. It was an interesting cruise with a pre-recorded soundtrack explaining the history of Singapore. We stopped near Marina Sands and watched the laser light show, which I must say did not reach the heights I was anticipating. That said, it was worth viewing. Enjoy your time on the river as it provides a good insight to Singapore."
,,A Pleasant Walk,5.0,,Starting at Clarke Quay we walked all along the river to Merlion at Marina Bay. It is quicker to take a bum boat but is an alternative way. The river is actually very dirty and full of leaves and debris which appears to collect in large clusters. Such a shame for such a beautiful place

,,Lasershow is a rip off,1.0,,Have you that amazing pictures of the laser show? You will probably don't see anything of that in reality. The real Show with the amazing projections can only be seen from marina bay. 38 SGD for that show is a waste of money. Better enjoy a meal somewhere
,,Very soothing,5.0,,"The river promenade at Boat, Clarke and Robertsons Quay in Singapore is a must do for all travellers to Singapore. It is very well maintained and has lots of restaurants offering different variety of cuisines, This place dazzles during the evenings. A boat ride in the heritage boats is strongly recommended.

,,Eating/nightlife!,4.0,,"We stayed by the river for a few days so were close to Robertson Walk and Quay, and strolled along the river up to Clarke Quay also. Lovely spot with plenty of great restaurants/cafes/bars. This place really comes alive in the evenings with younger people and music, so if this is not your thing, visit earlier in the day. We loved it and had some great meals along the river front. You can also get the River Cruises/taxis along here also"
,,Cruising on the River,5.0,,"A perfect way to see Singapore from the River and learn the history of the colonial settlement. So much to see and take in. Thoroughly enjoyed and definitely recommend as a ""must do"" when in Singapore"
,,It has everything,5.0,,"really -- it does. Just follow the river and you will end up at the harbor. There is a restaurant for anythign you are looking for and then some. This is a great place to walk, ride a bike, jog or stroll. I enjoyed it much better than the RiverWalk in San Antonio."
,,Singapore River By Night,4.0,,"We started our river cruise at Boat Quay jetty and we did ours at night - it was a 40 minute round trip, our highlights included - The Fullerton Hotel and Merlion Statue lit up, the night view of Marina Bay Sands from the boat and watching the nightly laser show at that building, Helix Bridge and the Esplanade Jetty area. It was S$25 for adults and S$15 for children. There was also audio visual commentary in English. The small river boats are covered but there is an open area at the back of the boat that has the best views and gets filled up very quickly."
,,Plenty of photo oportunities.,4.0,,"Quite an interesting area of Singapore and central to many other destinations in the city.
The Singapore river is now the countries second largest reservoir! This is an amazing feat if you had seen the river in the 1960's. Then it was a filthy polluted cesspit."
,,Best Night life destination in SG,5.0,,An array of restaurants with all types of cuisines and drinks available.Clarkquay hosts a number of pubs open till late night.
,,"Central location, great restaurants",4.0,,"Absolutely stunning walks along the river. The walkway is lined with restaurants and cafes. Best at night, rather lonely during the day. Bum boat cruise along the river at night is also a must."
,,This is it!!!,5.0,,"Personally I love, I really love, a long walk along Singapore River esplanade. The view is excellent and it does not matter if this is sunny day or a rainy. In both cases take a colorful umbrella and walk along. If you are tired you can always seat in one of the many small restaurants, get some drink (the Singapore Tiger is excellent in the evening). Just forget about the rest of the world - good or bad it doesn't matter - and enjoy your freedom."
,,Singapore river,5.0,,Around the river we can find restaurants of different countries and you can enjoy the delicious food.You can get package for boating and some other.
,,Just turn up for a good value hour,4.0,,"Have a cheap day out by going to the waterfront by tube and walk up to the boat kiosk and off you go. Good commentary which allows you to look around whilst learning. You can then walk back along some of the route at your leisure or take the tube elsewhere to the places you have seen. You don't need anything more organised, very easy!"
,,Very beautifully developed riverside area,5.0,,"The entire riverside area along singapore river is very beautifully developed. Starting from Clark Quay , going towards Boat Quay and further down towards marina bay area, is like a glowing chain of lights and activity.
There are many eating options along the river side. The river side area buzz with nightlife after 7 pm.
You can view many historical building along the river side.
Overall a very pleasant and charming experience."
,,Evening Cruise - Boat,4.0,,Have an Evening cruise in boat and the entire area lits by this time where you experience the evening to night changeover and lighting all around. Have an opportunity to have a dinner by the river side. You could actually feel the River while having your dinner.
,,Diners' Delight!,5.0,,"The Quays are destinations in themselves. The riverwalk area offers so many eateries, that it's difficult to choose one from another. We had hoped to enjoy a river taxi ride as we'd done in the past and were disappointed to find that it no longer operates. However, the Quays offer a variety of entertainment for everyone."
,,Watch the tourist boats glide along.,5.0,,"Last night (Thursday, 16 Jun 16) I enjoyed watching all the tourist boats gliding on the river while sat on the Boat Quay side opposite Clarke Quay.

People run, jog or walk along the boardwalks enjoying the cool of the evening.

A nice place to relax...maybe next time I'll take a boat ride...it looked like fun."
,,Great walk,4.0,,"Walking along the river is a nice experience. The walk is not hard and offers great views, both day and night. This is something that is a must just to experience Singapore from yet another angle."
,,Very informed tour,4.0,,Enjoyed the afternoon on the boat listening to the history of Singapore. The tour didn't last that long as the river is blocked both ends but you get a round trip. One down side as it had rained before we got on and they had not wiped the outside seats over. . we got wet. . . !
,,Foodies Paradise,4.0,,"What a great choice for foodies, this is a vibrant area, with food and drinks from across the world. If you want the famous Singapore chilli crab, then book a restaurant, very popular."
,,Scenic,5.0,,"Be careful and clear on prices, particularly seafood dishes, such as chili crab! There are better areas to eat! Nice to stroll through!"
,,Night Life,5.0,,"Every one MUST visit ""Clarks Quay"" This place comes alive at night with every other club / bar hosting ""Live Music"" The atmosphere is fantastic with restaurants of all types everywhere.

,,Awesome way to spend the evening,4.0,,"Singaporeans just love their river. Great eateries at clarke Quay, You can taste the best of sea food, great ambience and a wonderful way to spend the evening. There are rows of eateries and wonderful restaurents along the river"
,,Boat cruise,4.0,,A pleasant 40 min trip along the Singapore river taking in the history and changes made to this important part of Singapore. A good way t o see places that are worth a visit on foot later.
,,A must stop location,5.0,,"They have their own characteristics; due to Singapore's hot and humid weather, if you can't visit them in one go, do it bit by bit. You can spend hours there wandering around. You can take a river cruise as you like."
,,A journey into the past,5.0,,"The river cruise was an enchanting and enlightening one. While you admire the modern sky scrappers all around,the river cruise takes you to past history of Singapore, as how it was earlier and how it developed. The heritage buildings and bidges are really worthy to look at.."
,,Historically worth walking around,4.0,,Interesting place with so many places to eat at. Though a little expensive. Beer bout $10. Great view of the Marina Sands as a backdrop to the old bridge. Lovely at night.
,,It Depends On What You Focus On,5.0,,"Singapore River is a vague description of a place. The actual river is not that great. But walking along the river from Robertson Quay to Merlion Park is a great experience. Also, I don't recommend the boat ride. It's overpriced and you get similar views or better views from the riverside. Save yourself the S$25 per person and walk the river. Robertson Quay is my favorite of the Singapore River for eating. Clarke Quay is the most hip and hopping place. Boat Quay is the most annoying as people just want you to eat at their restaurants. I do highly recommend Singapore River (but not the River Cruise)."
,,Food and culture,5.0,,Loved checking out the wonderful eateries with fresh seafood and local cuisine. Also lovely for walking and spending an early morning or late evening jog/walk soaking up the atmosphere
,,Fun.,4.0,,"A nice relaxing way to see some of Singapore by boat, especially if you get someone who is driving, and is keen on telling something about there city."
,,Night Trip,5.0,,Take a bus boat to cross the river at the Esplanade (Marina) area going to Clarke Quay at night. The lights of Marina Bay area are really something not to miss.l
,,Excellent area for night and day entertainment and food,5.0,,Packed with restaurants and bars that stretch over three main areas from Robertson Quay through Clarke Quay to Boat Quay. Ends at Marina Bay and the Esplanade
,,Great place to start your tour of Singapore,4.0,,"The Singapore River has a rich history and has been the heart of the country for centuries. A great way to get a feel for the city is to go to Clarke Quay, get on one of the bum boats that takes you down to Marina Bay ($25 for adults round trip, a bit less one way). The ride stars with spectacular views of the old architecture and you pass by historic buildings and under bridges as you move towards Marina Bay. Entering the Bay you will have a unique view of the financial district skyscrapers, the durian shaped Theaters on the Bay, the Art & Science Museum, the Merlion fountain and the Marina Bay Sands. You can get off by the Sands, explore the high end shopping spots, take a view from the Sands, walk through the Gardens by the Bay, explore the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome then jump on the MRT for dinner in Chinatown or Little India. This makes for a great day tour."
,,Colourful river,4.0,,There is a mix of modern skyscrapers as well as old buildings along this historical part of the river.
,,Very pleasant trip.,5.0,,Went on the river cruise to Marina Sands. It was cheap and a great way to see Singapore. No traffic to annoy you.
,,Great Boat trip along the River,5.0,,"About 45 minutes trip with some interesting commentary about the history of the river and views of items not visible from the land. Great view past the Singapore Merlion in full flow. Our captain was also a great photographer and took some really good well posed pictures, an added bonus."
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,Nice restaurants along the Singapore river. Wait until the restaurants offer free drinks or happy hour. Cool party location at Clarke Quay.
,,Walking Around The River,4.0,,"Usually, when I visited Singapore, I always use the MRT to the places I'll go.
But yesterday, I began my journey in Clarke Quay, along the river, walking through the underpass to the Merlion Park, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay until Super Tree. Super walking at afternoon!"
,,Leisurely tourist trip,3.0,,Riding down the river and back up again takes about 40 minutes and is accompanied by a recorded commentary which cannot be heard if you decide to sit out back in the fresh air. Seeing the old and the new alongside each other was a pleasant way to see a different side of the city and I am glad we did it. I bought a Singapore Sling from the ticket office and had no problems taking it on board. Tickets quite expensive but then ... youa re being a tourist!
,,Loved this area,4.0,,"We stayed on our return to Singapore and found this end of Singapore excellent. River cruises, restaurants, history, all walkable"
,,Great way to leave Merlion Park,4.0,,Having walked to Merlion park we decided to take the river boat back to Clark quay . The commentary was informative and it was a nice way to see Singapore.
,,A nice boat ride and walking area,4.0,,Went on the boat ride down the river. Quite enjoyable. Also walked along boat quay and Clarke quay areas and it was a nice walk in both areas. Get a photo with raffles statue and some beautiful old bridges to see.
,,Centrally located - very well developed area,4.0,,"well the whole of singapore is very well developed, but i really feel that the area around the river is the best - esp boat quay and clarke quay. while these areas are mostly commercial, boat quay and clarke quay are very well known for their hip restaurants, bars and cafe (this is mostly all in clarke quay while boat quay is more relaxed - casual dining out by the river sort of a place). these areas are good for evening strolls or you could even try the cruises in the river"
,,It's not really a river,5.0,,"Singapore is not big enough to have a river, so they have to make do with this approximation of a river. I've been on boart trips several times, it is a good half-hour cruise. Many expats like to.have a drink on the banks of the river after work. Singapore is always hot, so a nice cold Tiger beer is always welcome."
,,Pleasant evening activity,4.0,,It was nice to stroll along the quays of the evening and have a drink and eat good food. You will find many fine restaurants and bars there.
,,"Simple Walk and Drinks at Boat Quay, along Singapore River",4.0,,"Always felt good walking down from Clark Quay towards Boat Quay. Many pubs and restaurants lined the river side. Finally settled down at Penny Black for a couple of quick drinks with my friends by the river, with a good view of UOB, Fullerton Hotel, ACM. Simply made my weekend beautiful."
,,Take a Bumboat down the river,5.0,,Good way to get an overview of Singapore & its attractions from the river. Good to do day or night as if it is evening you will see the light show
,,Day trip,4.0,,"Yes well worth a visit to fill in time,better to do the night trip more to see with the light show,we dropped of at the Marina bay for a few hours. Usual taped commentary that makes no sence when the guy does not start the tape at the right time."
,,pretty,3.0,,"we took a river boat tour on the river and enjoyed it. We were a bit disappointed though, as the tour is expensive."
,,"Nothing special, good choice of restaurants on both banks",3.0,,Not worth to spend time and money of on boat tour on th river. Walking along the banks gives you more info. River can be muddy and smelly.
,,starts here,5.0,,The singapore story starts here on this river. Full of old and new buildings along the river banks!!
,,Delightful dawdle!,4.0,,"Some super fit reviewer said you can walk from Clarke Quay to Gardens on the Bay in 35 minutes. In fact it took us 2 hours, but we did dawdle! So much to see! The wide concrete path follows along the south bank past shops, many interesting sculptures, flowering shrubs - and all the time with views across the calm waters of the river. Near Clarke Quay there is a large swing for the adventurous! Along Boat Quay there are many old eating places with skyscrapers towering beyond - the old and the new. The path passes under the various roads which cross the river until we get close to Merlion Park where there is a double pedestrian crossing. Many tourists here. We cross the pedestrian Jubilee Bridge to the north, follow along the path north of Marina Bay, and back across the excellent Helix Bridge. And there are the gardens! This is a great walk, and a special insight into Singapore."
,,short boring ride,3.0,,nothing much to see except buildings and green dirty water. u can see more stuffs by actually walking around the rive.
,,Good night venue,4.0,,"Very atmospheric after dark, good night out, good place to dine. Impressive lighting effects and a good location for photography."
,,A must!,5.0,,Highly recommended. Many interesting sights to see. Peaceful. Not that expensive. Staff often grumpy.
,,Where the heart of Singapore beats,4.0,,"To follow this roughly 3 km river, is a beautiful and interesting walk. Crossing the bridges, having a look at some funny sculptures, investigating the quays, on the way dropping into some temples is a good half day program. Start in the morning, when the temperature is slightly lower. At Clark Quay reward yourself with a cold drink and a bite. It isn’t the cheapest place to eat, but for us that was the best. I’m not praising the quality of the food, probably somewhere else you can find something better, but here you pay for the environment surrounding you and the mood. After a happy, entertaining morning, finish the tour at Marina Bay."
,,Such a lot to see.,5.0,,"Lots of shops, bars and restaurants as you make your way along the riverside trail. Interesting statues (some you might trip over!). Clarke Quay has a different slant on a Singapore Sling, but only for the brave! Stunning architecture and wonderful visual impact day or night. Little boat trips to be had from Clarke Quay down to MBS - probably best at night for the laser show."
,,Wonderful Relaxing Location,4.0,,The River Front is a lovely location to walk though and enjoy a drink or seafood meal. It is easy to reach and located via the New Bridge which is next to the Parliament Building. This is a wonderful location to see Singapore traditional buildings with the back drop of Modern Sky Scrapers. There is seafood and general Asian food for every taste and you can easily find something to suit your budget. After some time relaxing watching the world go by you can take a nice walk along the River Bank.
,,City View,4.0,,"Its good, the view shows how the city looks by the river. If you take a boating you could see things very well and its worth the time. The best time would be by evening other times would be hot and you would not be able to enjoy with the sun above you."
,,The River of Life,4.0,,"Exploring Singapore can be done in so many different ways from walking, MRT, Rickshaw or even a boat.

Exploring the river by boat can give you an idea of some of the places you may want to explore by foot later such as all the exciting eateries along Clarke Quay. Even more fun is to do the trip on a traditional Singapore river boat..."
,,Interesting river walk,4.0,,"Ideal evening stroll along the Singapore River, starting at the Marina walking towards Clarke quay there is an array of restaurants and bars. Ideal to stop and take a break from the Singapore heat. There is also opportunity to take a river tour at various locations. There are some fantastic photo opportunities of famous Singapore landmarks"
,,New out of old,4.0,,"Clarkes Quay, very quirky use of older buildings and boats. Boats put onto the quay side now restaurants and bars, older building converted into shops, cafes, bars and restaurants."
,,Such a change,4.0,,"A well worth visit to the Quays area. Along the river the area has been regenerated and now boasts many many restaurants, coffee shops and bars."
,,Great night hangout area,5.0,,"Singapore River has an amazing history of how once it was a dirty damp, now a popular tourist spot cum CBD area. at night, it becomes a romantic area for couples/friends to chill out or catch up after work... ^.^"
,,Historically important...,5.0,,"and brought back to life in a short, short time. Singapore decided to clean up this river that was important in the history of colonial trade in Southeast Asia, and now it's a pleasant place to sit, surrounded by sculptures, and watch small boats pass, or walk across the old bridge from the quay to the park across the river."
,,A nice stroll,4.0,,"This was a lovely walk in the evening and during the day, with pubs and restaurants all the way along the river."
,,Take a night cruise,4.0,,We went at night and it was a really lovely experience seeing the city lit up from the viewpoint of the boat. You can also take a dinner cruise.
,,Take a walk from Clarke Quay to Merlion Park,5.0,,"The best way to enjoy the Singapore River is walk along side it from Clarke Quay till Merlion Park and back. The best time to do it is evening. There is also a boat ride available on this route.

You can see Raffles Place, Asian Civilizations museum on this route."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"This place is calm during other time and rocking on Friday and Saturday nights. We stayed here in Boat Quay and enjoyed the area for 5 complete days. Easily accessible to attractions, I would love to recommend and stay here in this area."
,,Cool and Relaxing,4.0,,I love Singapore River i super amazed the place and i meet some friends their and they are cool. During night time is the best time for walking around because the place is safe to everyone even though your alone.
,,Worth strolling along the river,5.0,,"A lovely area o explore new and old areas of Singapore ,stroll along the river taking your time plenty of places to stop and eat. The atmosphere in the evening is lovely a mixture of locals and tourists."
,,"explore the past and the birth of modern Singapore,",5.0,,"Stand at the Raffles Landing Site along the Singapore River, and imagine the early days, all ships had to sail pass the Singapore River to reach the godowns and shop houses at Boat Quay. Trade exploded, and other quays, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay, for instance were developed. This humble river is where Sir Stamford Raffles first stepped on the island in 1819. In the 1970s when shipping trade was moved, the river underwent a transformation. There are many hotspots dotted along the river, you can cool down with a drink and enjoy mouth-watering cuisines at Boat Quay. Keen for more heart-pumping entertainment? Dance the night away at Clarke Quay at the trendy nightspots that once were warehouses. For a slice of nostalgia, stop by the moored Chinese junks ('tongkangs') that have been beautifully refurbished into floating restaurants. You’ll find laid-back charm at Robertson Quay’s converted godowns, perfect for a morning coffee. Or stroll down the river and spot the sculptural artworks that depict Singapore’s past and present. If you like walking to explore the past and the birth of modern Singapore, this could be one for you."
,,Entertainment,4.0,,"Lots of Restaurants & Pubs some with live band. Walking along the river to Clarke Quay is nice, not so hot as plenty of trees are planted. For those who like food and drinks, this is the place."
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,"I loved the day and night time ambience of Clarke Quay and nearby surrounds. There are so many restaurants to chose from. Some have inside seating with airconditioning, others also have outdoor seating along the river.

The variety of food was great, something for everyone.

We all know Singapore is expensive right !!! Well, there were some restaurants I didn't mind paying the extra for. There was one fantastic Italian place with lamb shanks to die for. In contrast to that, and opposite, there was another that wasn't very good value for money serving racks of ribs that weren't very nice.

If you are staying nearby and are a bit of a foodie, take the time to stroll around the area."
,,fun place to walk around and eat,5.0,,"really fun place, walk on two banks of the river, every 5 min walk there is a bridge to cross to the other side. cute restaurants and craft stores."
,,Loved it,4.0,,"Just walking along the river is an amazing attraction to do. You can have lunch or Dinner at the River, and Party at night. Loved the ice cream on bread, unusual but nice. You can buy them from little stalls along the river"
,,Whats so special?,3.0,,NOthig to see of the river except the heritage structures along the banks on one side and the sky scrappers on the other. Better to walk along the river path and experience the pulse of the city than to take a ride by the river which though not dirty has murky waters
,,"Lights Music Food at Night, Walkway Food & River Ferry by Day",5.0,,"Day and night along the river is very different.
Take a river ferry ride and walk around the quays during the day and at night
Alive at night with lights, music and variety of food
Every visitor should visit once a trip at least
Great to walk along river in morning to MRT, office or leisure attraction"
,,An interesting walk,5.0,,"We always enjoy walking along the river through, Clarke, boat And Robertson Quays when we visit Singapore. We are always delighted by the brass figures along the riverside depicting life in Singapore in the earlier years. A recent addition is the beautiful artwork in the walkway tunnels under the roads. Again they tell a story of the history of Singapore. There is always someway along the way for a cold drink or icecream."
,,"Soothing, but expensive for the price",3.0,,"Its a nice soothing journey, with history of Singapore being narrated, but nothing so great a view that you cannot avoid. So if you have extra time n money go for it."
,,Informative river cruise,4.0,,"One morning during our stay in Singapore we walked to Clark Quay and boarded a ""Bum Boat"" for a trip along the Singapore river.
The trip certainly gives you another perspective of life in Singapore. The boat takes you through Clark Quay, Robertson Quay and into Marina Bay. It takes around forty minutes for the tour and there is a recording that points out places of interest along the way and gives you a bit of the history of Singapore. During the tour you pass Merlion Park, near the Fullerton Hotel, also.
I would recommend this trip to visitors to the city."
,,great way to see Singapore,5.0,,"Take a ferry from any point on the route, get off where you like, get on a later ferry, get off where you started - eventually. The boat goes all around the marina, then up river stopping at all the interesting parts. including Raffles landing point and Clarke Quay (really vibrant and exciting in the evening). If you time it right in the evening around 8.00pm, you may get to see the whole of the water and light show at Marina Bay Sands from the water."
,,See Clarks Quay on the Singapore River,5.0,,Along the river is not only the financial district but also Clarks Quay. Plenty of restaurants and bars. Take your pick.
,,Walk the distance,5.0,,Start at the Fullerton Hotel and walk all the way to Zion Rd. You pass lots of stuff to see and do - its especially colourful at night. Eat at Izekaya Tomo or Aburiya or Brewerkz or wait until you get to the cheap but fabulous Zion Rd Food Centre. The best part is that with a bit of planning you don't even have to cross a street once you have started. When you are done catch a bus from Zion Rd to Chinatown or Orchard Rd.
,,A changing city scape,4.0,,Interesting that the water is potable and Singapore's drinking water. Interesting pubs and cafes abound. Take a stroll.
,,Easy Stroll,4.0,,"This is a good place to be in the late afternoon. Find a place to sit, wait for the sun set, and see the city changes its colors. With a little breeze, this can really relax you in this big city. It can be quite busy as you continue to walk towards Clarke Quay with all the bars and pubs along the river. It's touristy but still fun!"
,,Leisure activities by the river,5.0,,"Singapore really did a good job in rehabilitating the river and turning it into a tourist hub. There are many F&B outlets, river cruises, thrill rides that one can engage or simply take a stroll along the river.
However because of the tropical heat and humidity in Singapore it is advisable that you dress lightly as one can really soak in sweat but the experience is well worth it."
,,WALK AND BOAT,4.0,,This is a place to come for an evening walk and to go on boat ride to see the Singapore lights.A good place for family friends and kids.
,,Better at night,5.0,,By day Clarke Quay is hot and rather drab. By night it is full of life and lights. Great to catch the water taxi or river cruise and just drift along looking at the sights and sounds.
,,Ideal at sundown.,4.0,,"A lively place both day and night,more so at night.Pick-up places for river cruises,Plenty of bars and eating places of all sorts."
,,Best Thing we did in Singapore,5.0,,"I was a bit unsure if this would be any good - but heading along the river, seeing the sights and hearing more of the history of the city, I was disappointed I didn't do it sooner. Great way to be able to take pictures of many of the historic buildings and icons, and quite well priced."
,,good food but expensive,4.0,,"Happy hour goes for many hours on the waterfront 2 for 1 drinks in most places average $14 dollars for half pint and Singapore sling &18.00 but you get 2 for that price which is not to bad considering the prices around the place. food is good s well SQUE is one place we kept going back to next to the CENTRAL shopping centre above the CLARKE QUAY MRT, good time with friends watching people go by."
,,Free evening walk,3.0,,"Many cities have river walks. Think of San Antonio in Texas with its Spanish charm. Much of the Singapore River walk actually has charm but Clarke Quay has overlaid the old godowns and warehoues with martian umbrellas that don;t really keep out the sun or the rain! Robertson Quay has more charm, fine dining but remains the quieter end. Boat Quay section of pubs and restaurants has managed to retain some of the charm.
San Antonio has many small shops with quality souvenirs and wide range in prices.. That is lacking in Singapore river area except for Selangor Pewter shop and 1-2 others! AFter drinking and dinner, many visitors may want to ""walk it off"" by doing some souvenir and luxury shopping?"
,,cool river running through the city,4.0,,"a nice and clean river running through the heart of the city. has a nice walk way along it. ca see many good sites once u walk beside it, u can avail a boat trip too."
,,Harbours of peace,4.0,,"You can take a boat trip to go through Robertson and Clerke Quays and it's really nice but I personnaly like to walk around until the Marina Bay. Robertson Quay is, more local, queit on the week days but busy on fridays and satterdays. The Clarque Quay is surrounded by the restaurants , bars for tourists but it doesn't mean very bad food and service."
,,This is where everything happens.,5.0,,"This is where everything happens. Whether you cruise, walk or job around the river - it is an amazing place to see. No trip to Singapore is complete without coming here."
,,"a man made river, with lots of things on its sides to do.",5.0,,"its a really nice place to visit, in the evenings. there are lots of restaurants on the river side. there are rides that takes you to the bay area and provides a nice view of the light and sound show there. it is good to walk on its banks in the evenings."

,,A Relaxing Way to See the City,4.0,,"The Singapore River is only about 3 kilometers long but served an important economic role in the early days of Singapore. Now, it's primarily a tourist attraction as well a peaceful place for one to relax along it's banks. There is a boat company that offers tourists a forty-minute ride on the river."
,,Take a boat tour at night,4.0,,We took a boat tour in the evening. It's the best way to appreciate the river and building surrounding it. The water is peaceful and you will get a great view of the city at night.
,,Take this Tour,4.0,,"Nice leisurely ride down the river with a good audible explaining the history of the settlers. Showed all the bridges the Merlion Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Singapore Flyer, great ride for the money."

,,great for evening cruise,5.0,,The river provides a great backdrop during the day and in the evening it was very pleasant to sit by the river and enjoy the dinner and drink. Also worth doing the evening cruise with glance of the marina light show
,,A Long/Short Peaceful Walk,5.0,,This river walk is as long as you feel like walking. It is a walk that can be taken by able or disabled adventurers. The river winds through the city and beyond. It takes you to many Quays and the riverside buildings are very interesting. If you take a map of Singapore walkers can link up with the MRT and return to base without having to retrace their steps.
,,Ordinary but Beautiful,3.0,,"Actually this river is no special, but the government of Singapore make this place really nice and beautiful. You can ride a boat here with romantic view along the river."
,,Nice experience!,4.0,,Nice way to see Clarke Quay and the river. Great to find little hot spot recommendations for restaurants. Maybe on the boring side for kids but its something to do!
,,a lovley place to sit and watch the city,4.0,,sat here one evening before going on the Singapore flyer just watching the city lights come on and chilling lucky enough to have a fly over by some jets and helicopters
,,Great places to relax and eat,5.0,,"Newton hawkers centre for awesome chilli crab and chicken rice. River safari is good, also went to Bollywood farm at Kranji for lunch."
,,lovely way to see the city,4.0,,me and my partner took a boat trip down the river with a tour guide explaining all the buildings and history to us which was very interesting and a nice way to see the city by water.
,,Something to enjoy for everybody..,4.0,,"Of the 3 (Boat, Clarke & Robertson Quay), I prefer Robertson Quay.
All of these places are fairly quiet during the day, but come to life as soon as the sun sets.
It may be rather warm during the day, but if you can take the heat it is enjoyable to walk along the river where people bike, walk their dogs or play with their children.
After sunset it becomes cooler and much more lively! There is a great choice of all sorts of restaurants, bars, wine-bars etc.
Robertson Quay is a bit more local / expat and less 'touristic' (less noisy) then Boat & Clarke Quay."
,,Nice Walk,5.0,,"This was where it all started, the Singapore River. In the early days of Singapore, the river was where barges made their way up, with coolies unloading goods into the godowns. The area has become the CBD of Singapore, and the old godowns and warehouses have been converted into great restaurants and watering holes. There's something for everyone here. Within a short distance from the river, there are museums, concert halls, good food, etc. Dirty and smelly decades ago, the river has been cleaned up and turned into a beautiful stretch for a really nice stroll. You can also get a boat ride up or down the river too, and get a look at the city from a different vantage point. Strongly recommended."
,,Singapore River,5.0,,"Clean and tidy walk which takes you through Robertson Quay, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay. Plenty of shops and eating places along the way"
,,FREE plus good views and easy access,5.0,,"This will suit people of all ages. There are really good vies up and down the river and due to the Singapore temperatures throughout the year, you can do this activity any time - even the rain is warm."
,,Perfect for a stroll,5.0,,"Taking a stroll or job alongside this river is a great way to see different neighborhoods and find different eateries. As you head west/north away from Clarke Quay, it becomes less touristy and takes on a more local feel. Shade abounds, but keep in mind it gets hot during the day (especially during clear skies). Wear sunscreen and insect repellent.

East walking for families with kids (and strollers), joggers/exercising, couples, etc.. Good for bikes too."
,,Singapore trip,4.0,,"You can take a river boat cruise from here which last about 40 mins the cost is 25S$ per person but is worth it, the area is also full of places to eat."
,,Good place to end the day,5.0,,We often use to sit by the Singapore river in Clarke Quay. A great view at the night. Just sit back and relax here.
,,A must for all visitors,4.0,,Took a boat ride down the river and walked the quays on several occasions. There are very many eateries and bars (surprisingly few coffee shops/ice cram parlours which is a shame). It is the starting point for the boat trip - don't try and book the duck tours from here as despite being advertised as a ticket booth it was shut (during a weekday afternoon).
,,Nice view for couple or family,4.0,,"many cafe & restaurant and bar for dinner or for hangout with your friends, with nice view to look at the river and many lights especially at night."

The foods, are also good. many many many restaurants and bars. many kinds, many alternatives. My favorite, still hOOters, hahahahah"
,,"Boat and Clarke is touristy, Robertson is far better and mainly locals",4.0,,"Boat key and Clarke's Quays are worth walking through. Food and drink is heavily overpriced and in general service is not the normal Sg high service. Probably because people don't expect tourists to become regulars. They are worth walking through. Locals tend to go to Robertson's Quay, quieter, better quality and service is generally better."
,,Quite touristy but also quite scenic ...,3.0,,Quite touristy but also quite scenic ... It is true that by walking along the river you can see many of the sites in Singapore but it is also really quite pricey and touristy.
,,great view,4.0,,singapore river it close with marina bay and merlion park you can walk it use a few time if you want go there just use MRT to raffles place and exit fullerton hotel and you walk direct you will see the old bridge and see the statue children play river ! suggest you will have good view when you walk in center of bridge .. don't forget to taste ice-cream $1 but delicious

,,Good place to know Singapore history,5.0,,Must see if you want to know about traders in ancient time. Take a boat ride which lasts 20-25 min. But not on a sunny day!
,,Good,4.0,,"Been here for some gathering event, the river view is nice and also clean. Surrounded by building and also cafe along the clarke quays. Visit here in the early morning, place is so quiet.."
,,Go with the flow,5.0,,"You will end up at the river very often, it is where you get river taxi & bout tours from, there are eateries along the river at all the quays, Clarke queues is the best at night for places to eat and drink."

,,Worth doing,4.0,,A pleasant trip from Clarke Quay to Marina Bay. Nice views and good way to see great architecture and places along river.
,,Great spot to relax,5.0,,Both Boat and Clarke Quays are lovely spots just to sit and relax and watch the world go by. Boat Quay is close to the old Colonial heart of the city if you want something other than shops.
,,Great walk...,5.0,,"This is a good walk alongside the Singapore River from the buzz of the financial district, up into residential areas. Very clean and completely safe to walk. Information boards along the way give plenty of detail about the past and present. Best set off in the early morning as you will be hot if you walk there and back as we did. Plenty of places to get refreshment back in the city! If you like walking and have a lively interest in things, this could be one for you."
,,Beautiful Views,5.0,,I walked through the Singapore river and had to stop and take in the beautiful view I had of the Marina Bay. This is definitely a great area to take pictures at in Singapore.
,,TRY IT,5.0,,"There are short boat tours on the river. It was nice to see if from the river side. They are called ""bum boats."""
,,Rather walk than taking a boat tour,3.0,,The 40 minute boat tour does not offer more than a lazy walk along the bay and the river. In stead of spending the money on the boat take for the same price two drinks!
,,"Take a boat in the evening, and enjoy the beautiful builing jungle of Singapore",4.0,,"Take a boat to enjoy Singapore at night, and enjoy the breeze of the wind, warm weather, and beautiful building"
,,"Great Walk, Food & Sites",4.0,,"I spent a couple of hours walking from Clarke Quay down to the Bay.

The meandering river takes you through a fusion of the old and the new whether it be buildings, landmarks or restaurants.

You can eat cheaply by the river or more high end by the Bay. If you start at the bay you can end at Clarke Quay for refreshing drinks!! Now why didn't I think of that??

I Took my walk later afternoon midweek and it wasn't too busy but I imagine that weekend it is a bustling centre of activity.

There are some fantastic photo opportunities throughout the walk.

Once you have passed Raffles Square there are some roadworks on the bridge which can cause you to get diverted away from the path if not careful."
,,SINGAPORE RIVER,5.0,,The best time to explore the river is during the nights when the entire stretch right from Marina bay sands until ClarkeQuay and Robertson Quay is lighted up.
,,Colouful stroll along the river,4.0,,So many different kinds of buildings and styles.Exceptionally clean and plenty to see and do.Worth the visit
,,Place for Cooling Down,5.0,,Perfect place when you're tired from walking and there are so many seats available. sitting while watching the river and boats passing by will give you a calming atmosphere in your mind.
,,Great for a quick overview of Singapore,4.0,,If you only have a short while in Singapore a trip on the river ferries is the way. Catch it from Clarke Quay and head towards the stop at Merlion and get off and have a stroll. Then continue to Marina Bay and have a wander there before walking across the bridge to the Singapore Flyer. The river trip gives a good audio of the sites along the river and is well worth the fee.
,,So many things to do,5.0,,There are many different activities along the river. A walk will be fun as and you can also take tours along the river and learn about the city.
,,Just a typical south Asian river with lots of restaurants and shopping areas,3.0,,An adequate place to kill a couple of hours and grab something to eat. Looks better at night when all the places are lit up. Nothing outstanding to grab your attention.
,,Nice place for a long Relaxing walk,4.0,,"Can take a stroll from Clarke Quay till Fullerton along the river especially at night and appreciate Singapore nightlife and happenings there. Plenty of bars, bistro, restaurants offering almost all cuisines are located there.
Its a tourist place hence prices for everything are steep.
Very good for taking a long post-dinner walk with family."
,,Well worth a Visit,5.0,,"All 3 quays were within walking distance of our Park Regis Hotel, Clarke Quay was quiet during the day and comes to life at night for the younger generation, good food bars. Robertson quay was prettily lit up at night with lovely eat outside restaurants and boat quay was a busy area again for browsing and pleasant walk along."
,,Take a walk instead of a boat,4.0,,The Singapore river is pretty narrow and with a lot of high rises on both banks. From many spots you can have great pics. That's why (apart from being very expensive) I suggest to walk instead taking a boat ride.
,,A good area to walk,4.0,,"We decided to walk from the Merlion Park to our hotel on Orchard road and so followed the river passing both Clarke and Boat Key. It was an easy walk with plenty of shops, restaurants and there is always something to see happening on the river."
,,River view in night and city tour,3.0,,"You can have river cruise for 25SGD. They will tell you full history of singapore and have a tirp of river for 40 mins. This is also a amazing experience. But if you have visited Garden by bay , marina bay or singapore flyer then this is nothing against those."
,,"Great for a stroll, by day and by night.",5.0,,"Enjoy architecture, musea, street art. Numerous bars and restaurants all along the river. Clubs as well. Lively and relaxed. Al fresco and indoors, local or international...take your pick. It's all there."
,,Smooth ride on water,4.0,,"We experienced an exciting way to travel on the river . The ""Duck"". A great experience to finish your day tours. We had 24 hour Hop-on, hop-off bus tours and this made it an overall thrill to end our day. A bit rough and rugged on land but because it is an amphibious machine it was smooth as silk on water."
,,Carm and Quiet,4.0,,"On a trip through out the ""harbour"" of Singapore, everything seems so quite. Just floating on the river there are so much to see and even the sky line looks different from this site."
,,Gorgeous at night,5.0,,"The commentary was excellent, in both history and trivia, on our Singapore River cruise. All of the Quays have more than enough restaurants for even the fussiest diner. There is a pleasant walkway along the river."

,,Nice river,5.0,,This is a popular river with nice surroundings all around with hotels and eateries. It was once carrying sewage but was cleaned and renovated to convert this to a amazing river with boats and eateries all around it.
,,What a treat!,5.0,,A wonderful way to get a different perspective of Singapore. Well-worth doing both in the daytime and at night time.
,,The river attraction,4.0,,"It is worth to spend some time here. You can try the river cruise or just walk along the river till you find the merlion.I would recommend you do this on the evening.

,,brilliant,5.0,,we were lucky enough to book by night and glad we did it was a fabulous array of colours magnificent
,,"Buildings, Boats and water",4.0,,"the Singpore river is a great place to walk around. No matter where one starts, Helix Bridge, Marina Bay Shopping, Merlion, etc. the Singapore river runs over under or past the lot of them.
And because it is the Singapore River in the heart of singapore of course there is shopping at many locations on the shore.
Robertsons Quays is part of the shoreline of the river and while the quay itself is not the greatest it does have some great areas. When I was there at Chinese lunar New year the river was surrounded by lots of decorations and sculptures that gave a lovely show and feel to the place.
The River is definetly worth the visit."
,,interesting cruise,5.0,,the 40 min ride is well the money£ 12 per adult .see the old and new Singapore how life has changed since raffals day there so much to see on this lovley island
,,Bumboat cruise at night,5.0,,Had a lovely night-time cruise from Clark's Quay to the dick at the Sands Hotel to watch the nightly light and laser show. The river is VERY picturesque and clean. The lighted bridges we passed under were very attractive. Recommend this river just to sit along or ride upin.!
,,Awesome river walk/cruises,5.0,,"The walk along this river is short, easy, and spectacular with lighted bridges, brilliantly painted underpasses, and towering skyscrapers as a background. Clarke Quay is pricey, but so well done. For a quiet drink by the water, big dinner, or rousing time in a dance club. If time be sure and take a boat cruise out into the Marina Bay by the Merlion. Round trip only about $20."
,,Good place for a walk,4.0,,"Quiet, peaceful walk along the river. You can walk all the way up to Robertson Quay where there are restaurants or just sit along the river side and watch the bum boat go by, you can get tickets to go on a bum boat ride along the river as well if you like."
,,Nice way to beat the heat and see the sights,4.0,,"Taking a boat tour of the river during the hot humid days of Singapore offers a pleasant way to see the skyline and hear a short history lesson from the pre-recorded tapes played on a continuous loop. Many photo opportunities, like the Merlion fountain and stunning architecture. There are many stops along the river at which you can board a tour boat."
,,A beautiful boating experience,5.0,,"There are many points to get down for the boating ride in the river anytime, but evening is the best time to roam around the river and never miss it if you are in Singapore."
,,Good for walking,3.0,,"Walking along the river in the late afternoon / early evening or in the early morning can be quite pleasant. The river itself, however, is not so attractive and after a storm is often filled with various rubbish. Cycling along the river is also fun although you may be refused entry into the Clarke Quay precinct."
,,Cruise the quiet waterways of Singapore,4.0,,"We had a guided tour departing near marina bay sands through the financial district and then the colourful waterfront houses and restaurants that line the river. A relaxing ride, with good information on the history of the region.."
,,Easy walk by the water,4.0,,"I walked all the way from Marina Bay to Robertson Quay in the dark following the river. It looks a long trip on the map, but it was a pleasant walk as all the bridges have well lit underpasses so you don't have to cross any streets with traffic. There were many beautifull buildings and restaurants along the river, the noisiest at Clarke Quay. Cyclists should mount their bikes in the tunnels, but of course they don't bother so it is a bit frightening as one rushes past. I had my dinner at the end of the trail at Robertson Quay, where Barraka served a well prepared Penne all'Arrabbiata."
,,Good tour of the city,4.0,,"You can board this boat ride from 2-3 different points inside the city and the fare will change accordingly. We can see a lot of interesting and important buildings and places along the river ride. There is an automated commentary synchronized with the speed of the boat so that you get a very holistic experience and detailed information. You can also get down at a different location (say Marina Bay Sands), spend time at that place and board a different boat after some time. Just check for the timing of the last boat."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,This is a good thing to do early in your visit as it helps you find your feet. Reasonably priced too.
,,Very good use of an hour or so,5.0,,"If you start at the Raffles statue you can walk from the Boat Quay to Clarke Quay to Robertson Quay on one side of river and walk back on other. Just have a short detour where they are building a new station. Lots of interest and eating and drinking places, though place is MUCH quieter during the day."

,,Cruise Singapore river,5.0,,"Singapore river is surrounded by old buildings with loads of history , waterfront resturants , Bars and of course the most famous part of the river cruise is the Merlion at Merlion park , you can get a cruise with all the information via a screen and speaker system in the boat while you slowly cruise around this beautiful waterway , you will see some great old buildings , the large and modern buildings at Marina bay , this is great for the whole family and well worth doing"
,,great to walk along,4.0,,"its a great walk along the river, you can walk for miles, passing bars and restaurants along the way with some great places to stop and take photos."

Nice view of the harbor and nearby places. Calm atmosphere and just the best place to sit down and rest for a while, enjoying the magnificent view."
,,A bit of history,4.0,,"I did not take the boat ride as I walked along the shore. If you are a history buff, it would mentally challenge you to comprehend how a small back water village is transform to what Singapore is today. Literally, do take a walk."
,,Clarke Quays food outlets give a miss,1.0,,"Tired Clarke Quays eateries. Used to be very good. Don't waste money or time now. Lots of harassing, unpleasant smells, food really expensive and not value for money. Best is the outlook if you can get a table by the edge. There are so many other awesome eateries in Singapore than here."
,,Feel Singapore,5.0,,should not miss a Singapore night river Cruise. its an amazing experience totally different from what you see from the land and at day time

,,The old heart of Singapore,4.0,,"The cruise began at Clark Quay, and went out to the inner harbour area. The guide was very informative, and you got to appreciate the range of buildings and the uses they had once been put to.

,,Filled in Time,3.0,,"This is not an overly attractive stretch of water but it does provide a restful interlude, which in our case was waiting to get to the airport for a trip bank to Australia.

,,Diverse range of bars and restaurants,4.0,,"We stayed quite a way up the river so walked along all the quays a number of times. We found Boat Quay to be interesting with older style bars, still tourist orientated, at reasonable prices. Robertson Quay was very expensive for dining. The atmosphere on all of these quays was good and varied according to the time of day."
,,"Nice place to visit, either on the river or on the shore.",4.0,,"The Singapore River is a nice place to visit, either on the river itself or on the shore. The DUCKtour is a fun way to see part of the river as are the many shore walks that are available. While Singpore has may new buildings down by the riverfront is a great reminder of the Malay and colonial history of the city."
,,Of great historical value.,5.0,,"- The historic artery of Singapore's commerce.
- Various sections of interest: Marina Bay, the Civic District, the three Quays (Boat, Clarke and Robertson).

,,Pick your time,5.0,,Took the hop on hop off boat from Clarke Quay and got off at the Marina Bay Sands shopping Mall. Tried to get back from the Singapore Flyer but chose the wrong time - all the crews were having their tea (at once) However the delay gave us the chance to see the riverside at dusk/getting dark so we experienced all the buildings/bridges being lit up
,,"Hop on a river taxi in the day, tourist trap in the evening",3.0,,"In the daytime, the river is good for a walk but it's more interesting to hop on a river taxi or boat to see the sights from the water.

However, this place becomes a wallet death trap in the evening. Granted, lots of places to eat and drink spring up along the river (and let's not forget the clubs) but they're crazily priced and lacking in value most of the time. If you are here for the night-life, come by after having dinner elsewhere."
,,Pleasant walk stroll,5.0,,"On a very nice day you walk around this area for miles or less depends how far you want to walk around....as you do you find cafes, and stores and different scenes. Its very pleasant and safe to walk around, stop eat and enjoy the views."

,,Whatever type of evening you want it is here,4.0,,"The Singapore river is the heart of Singapore, where it initially grew and made its name. Now the quays along the river have been turned into modern restaurants, clubs and coffee shops. f you want an evening out what ever you are looking for you will find it here"
,,Good walk,4.0,,This is great to walk around either by day or night. It is a thriving part of the river where there are tons of bars and restaurants.
,,The Singapore River has undergone a sea change,5.0,,"Twenty years ago the Singapore River was dirty and smelly. Mr Lee Kuan Yew the then Prime Minister asked Minister Ahmad Mattar to clean up the river and make it attractive to tourists.
True to Mr Lee's dream, the Singapore River today is spick and span. There are many bridges spanning the river and the bridges are over a hundred years old. The Cavenagh Bridge is still standing and there is an old notice that says "" No horses and cattle are allowed on the bridge."" In the 1800s the bridge was used by animals but today it is a bridge for pedestrians.
You can take a cruise down the river by riverboats and you need to pay a small fee. From the River you can see Fullerton Hotel, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage.
No visit for the tourist is complete unless you visit the Singapore River which is now visible from the condos on both sides of the river."

You can easily spend 3 or 4 hours walked both sides of the river with hundreds of shops, bars, restaurants, spectacular buildings and street art sculptures to see. Plenty of museums, art galleries and historical builds and sites too.
We took the River Explorer Cruise and really enjoyed seeing the city from the water."
,,eating out,5.0,,"We found the markets where the Locals eat, good food and very cheap.Not your fancy restaurant but value for money"

,,Stunning Day and Night River Cruising,5.0,,"Our accommodation in Singapore was at the Swissotel Merchant Court, located right in the midst of Clarke Quay. So naturally we took advantage of going up and down the river to see the sights of Singapore from a different perspective. The night cruise that took in the laser show was the best experience if you are thinking of taking this ride."
,,Worth taking a quick cruise around,3.0,,"There are lots of operators offering medium priced cruises around the bay and the river. Not a bad way to gain a perspective of the harbour city and river environs - quite effective to orientate yourself. Some information is provided at a very basic level in the taped commentary. Lightshow, Merlion, Fullerton buildings and the old government buildings are clearly visible. However not a must do ticket item."
,,Desperate times for restaurants,2.0,,Surprised by the changes since my last visit. Lots of shops disappeared. The restaurants seem desperate for customers and staff are annoying trying to get you into them. There is a new art gallery opening this week. A good addition to the area.
,,Boat Quay for lunch,5.0,,"The Boat Quay along the banks of the Singapore River is a great place for an affordable lunch. So many restaurants all competing for business and most of them have ""set menus"" with a wide choice"
,,Singapore water tourist attraction,4.0,,"This river is passing through the city and there are many bridges, gardens and many attractive places made by few hotels which are on the river bank and also by some private buildings. One should have boating experience when you are in Singapore"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I suppose when all is said and done, it's just a river. But it's not just any old river, it's. River full of history, romance and sorrow. A boat ride on the Singapore River is a ride through history. Highly recommended."
,,Nice boat cruise,5.0,,Great to cruise the river in the numerous boats here. The Merlion is located in this river. there are quite a few nice restaurants on the river front.
,,Interesting part of old Singapore,5.0,,Good place to pick up a boat for a river tour. Plus interesting restaurants in the evening right on the river bank.
,,Just enjoy the sights.,5.0,,"Restaurants, clubs, beautifully kept, day and night it's a great walk. Cross the river at many points and don't miss the Clark Quay bridge on a Friday eevening. Lots of expats and friends sharing a beer and snacks."
,,Scenic,4.0,,This is worth doing it can be quite relaxing .The commentary is informing if the crew don't talk over it.It was quite hot when we did it so i sat inside.The ticket office is quite hard to find.You need to walk down Block B as A & D are on the water front
,,Scenic routes outlining some of Singapore history,4.0,,"This is a favourite jogging route because the skyline is beautiful and there's more than enough of Singapore history and culture to take in along the way. In addition, the coolness from the water of the Singapore River (although the water itself isn't so clean) tempers the sometimes-scorching heat of the Singapore climates."
,,"Good, but not really a river",4.0,,"The Singapore River is more of an inlet that a river, but it's fun to take a bum boat tour even so. You can imagine the debvopment of Singapore from a plague ridden collectiion of shacks to the mighty world financial centre it is today. Workers gather to drink and gossip by the banks of the river, shadowed by the offices of the financial empires."
,,"Food, drink and party all night",5.0,,"The place to be for great restaurants, bars and clubs. The river walk is well worth it (although very hot and humid). You can party all night along the river."
,,great night life,5.0,,If you want great night life when visiting singapore than this is the place to be there is a large selection of resturants and bars all quite reasonably priced you can take a boat ride down the river and even catch a lazor show definetly the place to visit
,,Very Scenic,5.0,,The Singapore River is central to Singapore. You can either stroll alongside the river on the many roads and footpaths that line the river or take a bumboat to sit back and enjoy the many historic sites along the river while viewing the cityscape.
,,Lovely early morning walk,4.0,,"Walked along the river early in morning, lovely ambiance, and beautifully clean as is all of Singapore. Not many people about mainly exercise walkers. Walked along past Clark quay area with all the colouruful eateries though shut at the early hour still attractive. Water tours start at 9.30 but the boats look very attractive to look at. Lots of gardens all in all an attractive place to get your morning exercise"
,,Best Visit at Night,5.0,,You will not stop taking a picture here.. Many spot to take a photograph along the way to get merlion park from way out of MRT Station.
,,Lovely to see the sights!,5.0,,We did the duck tour down this river. It's a great way to see a lot of Singapore and to get your bearings before exploring. Nice to see in the day and at night.
,,A must!,4.0,,"You cannot go to Singapore and not go to the Singapore river!. Yes it is full of tourists, yes it can be busy and noisy and yes restaurants prices are up to scale with the number of tourists around (or expats, most likely) but you go to go there to enjoy, especially at night. It worths a visit; walk from Robertson Quay to Clarke Quay, on Robertson Quay side then cross the bridge to Riverside Point and stop a Jumbo Seafood!"
,,Pricey,2.0,,"We were planning a boat trip but found the prices excessive for such a short journey and accordingly to some who took the trip, a bit variable in pace as there trip seemed to go fast as it passed others. Of course peak time is at night with the light show (disappointing) but still boats were full with tourists."
,,Built up area,3.0,,The river is now devoid of any of it's history or past. All the embankments are now surrounded by modern buildings and the waterway no longer has junks or small boats that used to line the banks.

,,A gentle stroll,5.0,,"Start your stroll along the river at Robertson quay and stop off for a drink. Robertson leads onto Clarke quay (more drink) and across the bridge to boat quay where there are to many restaurants to be counted.
A scenic walk and good food dotted along the way"
,,Beautiful area to walk.,5.0,,"We love walking along this path passing all the hotels, restaurants and various sights. These areas come alive at night with amazing coloured lights. There are many restaurants to choose from, and you can take a boat trip from Clarkes Qyay which I recommend doing to see the laser light show in the evening. It isn't the cheapest place to eat but it has the most fun!"
,,Nightlife for expats and tourists.,3.0,,"The Quays are all along the Singapore river and are full of restaurants and bars. There can be long waits for food if you go on the weekends or during peak travel season. The food is good, but if you don't want to wait there are other places that you can go all over Singapore (it is after all a Food City/Paradise). Great place to meet other tourists and expats."
,,Use your feet and walk the walk,5.0,,"This is a great way to see the sites as well as get some exerise. My girlfiend and I would go for a walk every morning, which is a great time to see the sites without lots of people around. It is also a great way to see what happens before all of the businesses open. Will certainly do it again on my next visit back to Singapore."
,,Beautiful area,4.0,,"Great area. I love that Singapore uses the real estate along the river, so many places do not do this. The area is usually busy but worth it."
,,Alive at nite,5.0,,Stay in hotel by Clarke quay love it comes alive at night buskers. Music. Plenty of food of all tastes river taxis traveling up and down Singapore river.
,,Nice relaxing and educational Boat ride,4.0,,"We took two different boat ride on different time of the day in the morning bubble jet board ride and evening we took the ride of bumb boat. both rides were video & audio narrated. Learn lot about River, buildings, hotels, restaurants , museum and historical monuments. Boat ride of the evening was more enjoyable because of good colorful lighting on bridges surrounding buildings, restaurants and Clark Quay were fantastic and very soothing to the eyes."
,,great way to see the river,4.0,,We took a river trip one evening. There was a river festival so it was very busy. There was a bit of confusion and the lady selling the tickets did not cope well. The boat was busy. It was a great way to see the river and the audio tour was informative the views where great. Good value for money.
,,Water just a little less polluted than it was in the 60s!,3.0,,Busy waterway - suggest you take the ferry round the bay and listen to the very interesting commentary. Most iconic sights are visible from the river.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Singapore River is a good place to be at especially during the night with lots of lights and a good view around.
,,Relaxing tour at night to beat the humidity,3.0,,"We went on a boat leaving from Clarke Quay and travelled for approximately 30 minutes around the Quays. The boat had speakers that were supposed to inform us of what we were seeing however the speakers were turned down and we could not hear anything. The river banks were bustling with nightlife, singing, partying and people generally having fun. Worth a trip to get a good view of the skyline and city buildings."
,,Average trip for a bad night...,2.0,,"For trips on the river, one really must know what happens in Singapore. We did not even get to complete it and waited for 45 minutes as they were preparing for Singapore fireworks... Do your homework before going on the river..."
,,Great Boat trip,4.0,,"Great evening boat trip, started from Clarke Quay down to the Marina. Great to see all the lights and take it he atmosphere."
,,Splendid location,5.0,,": it is a really nice location to be around- The walk along the coast of this is really nice with many nice buildings, hotels and other attractive spots passing by. There are many food joints just facing the river. Late evening with all lights on- it is very lively and eye catching. Out of all the Clark Quay area is the best. Even some adventurous rides are available there. Even sightseeing boat rides are available in this river."
,,Nice Place to Walk,4.0,,We took a walk along the Singapore river side. The view is not bad but it was too hot at day time. There are many cafes and restaurant but the price a bit high.
,,Lots of Eating Establishments,4.0,,"We stayed in a hotel on Robertson Quay and all of the quays were within one kilometer of our hotel. The riverside walkways were well lit and safe to use at any time of the day. Evenings at the restaurants and bars saw large crowds on all days - many had queues outside waiting for a table. The quantity and variety of the eating and drinking establishments was immense - you could purchase types of food from all over the world. Due to local tax applied to alcoholic beverages in Singapore, wines and beers were priced much higher than in the UK. You also have to pay 10% service charge in most outlets, this is added automatically, and a further 7% goods sales tax on top, so factor this in when getting ready to pay the bill."
,,A great place to walk or get a bumb boat and travel in style.,4.0,,"We took a walk and noticed a man dressed like a monk trying to con tourists by offering them a token of luck then asking for a donation, this is not what Buddhists do so don't give these people money take the token and walk away. Apart from that this is a great place to wander about looking at the historic buildings and grabbing some food. We also took a bumb boat ride brilliant I highly recommend it."
,,Always somewhere to eat but rather expensive,4.0,,There are many restaurants and shops to eat at but predominately more on the expensive. There arent any tak away shops as such and most of all sit downs only. Views are lovely to spend time at
,,Lovely Riverwalk,4.0,,At night all bridge were light on and changing colors. It's a great long walk after full course dinner.
,,45 minute River Cruise,4.0,,We considered the price of $25 per person was a bit over priced as we could have done an Island cruise of Singapore for a bout the same price. The commentary on the tour average as we feel a lot more information could have been given on different parts. Good views of Marina Bay Sands Hotel from different angles are worth seeing. The trip also passes Merlion Park as well as other interesting buildings and historical sights
,,Good for evening stroll,5.0,,"A pleasant place for an evening stroll. Not a good place to walk along in the day due to the heat. Food and music can readily bew found if you stroll along the river. Not much time, then take a boat ride."
,,Simply Beautiful,5.0,,Whether on the water or strolling along either side of the river from Quay to Quay there is just so much to see and so many places to check out. It is so clean and safe to be able to walk at leisure by the river. One of the many beautiful free things to do in Singapore.
,,The must if u like walk.,4.0,,"River walk is good across Clarke Quay, boat quay. The river cruise is not mandatory but if you want to have look of glittering singapore take a night ride."
,,Singapore River,5.0,,"October 2015 . That is a nice Place . Go can take a walk along the River . Restaurants are enough there , if you need a Drink ."

,,Evening stroll well spent,4.0,,"A walk up and down the Singapore River from the Marina Sands to the end of Clarke Quay is a must on a visit to Singapore. Take a boat if you are short on time, but the area is vibrant on an evening, with music, food and shops to suit all tastes."
,,OK walk,3.0,,Reasonable place for a stroll. Possibly better at night or the weekend as rather dead on a weekday afternoon.
,,Unwind,5.0,,"Escape from the busy city and take a walk along the river. You will walk past Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and Robertson Quay. Enjoy the calm walk as the peaceful waters flow by. Stop to enjoy the many sculptures dotted along the bank."
,,Love the river it's the heart of this city,5.0,,"The river from Marina Bay right up the Clarke Quay is the heart of this city. Always do a one or two hour cruise every visit and spend alot of time just walking the banks, Clarke quay is a night mecca, Boat Quay's still fun as is Marina Bay"
,,Relaxing walk,4.0,,We stayed at the Holiday Inn Atrium and walked round from Robertson Quay to Clarke Quay several times. This is a very peaceful walk and away from the road.
,,Colourful boats.,4.0,,"Sailing up and down Singapore river, boats lit up in bright lights, regular trips and it is just relaxing to sit along the steps on the river and watch the boats go buy."
,,our hotel is nearby .........,5.0,,"wonderfull, clean, safe............ an nice area to walk around. restaurants are a bit on the expensive side, but in general very good."
,,Down by the Riverside...,5.0,,"Clean and attractive now. Great place for a walk, a meal, a drink in the many pubs and bars, and to enjoy the ambiance of the area. Don't be put off by the many requests from the shops and pub and restaurant 'pimps' to come inside and eat or drink-they all have a 'special price' for you! After all, they are in competition with each other."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Walk the banks or jump a boat, so much to see and do. Lovely views of the landmarks and skyline of Singapore. Stop off at Clarke Quay or the shops or one of the many restaurants along the banks. Great place to visit."
,,Ensure at least one of the quays is on your itinerary.,5.0,,"The quays are buzzing with atmosphere, huge choice of bars and restaurants where you can soak up views of the finest architecture...old and new.....set by the river which is full of activity. Boat Quay was my favourite but they are all interesting."
,,Catch a bum boat,5.0,,"You can catch a bum boat at various terminals along the river. The main terminal is at Clarke Quay, this boat ride shows a different side to Singapore."
,,Stunning area,5.0,,"Loans of very nice restaurants and coffee bars, one shop even has a little bridge over an indoor pond which adds to the atmosphere. Plenty of other shops and theatres around and nice views and walks all over the place"
,,Enjoy the Peace,3.0,,"I came here one night, alone, but everything you need is already here. You can enjoy the night, eat whatever you want, drink whatever you want, play games and explore the river by boat, or just sightseeing. I enjoy the last one and smile in silence."
,,The heart of Singapore's history,4.0,,Surrounded by iconic monuments and historic buildings. The various quays by the river are interesting and there are also various statues representing Singapore's history.

,,Great place at night,4.0,,"Another place to enjoy the evening hours is along the Singapore River. It is lined with restaurants and filled with people, music, and bright lines. You can actually walk for ""miles"" on either side, so can't recommend one area over another, just pick someplace near where you are staying."
,,Stay at a hotel along the river,4.0,,"The stretch of the river from the Grand Copthorne waterfront Hotel (and Zouk nightclub) ... walking through Robertson Quay ... then trough Clarke Quay ... then through Boat Quay ... to the down town core (by the Fullerton Hotel) has an innumerable number of places to eat.

It would be impossible for me to think that a trip to Singapore could be complete without visiting these areas.

Bum-boat cruises are also available, that will take you all the way to Marina Bay Sand. These cruises are a little pricey, but if it is hot, might be preferable to walking.

If you stay at a hotel along the river, you can do the river in pieces; trying an eatery/nightclub here and there.

Swissotel Merchant Court is central."
,,Chill,4.0,,I gave it a four star rating simply because the cruise was a lot shorter that I expected. But the cruise is great take to take if you want chill way to enjoy the Singapore River and skyline. You will get to see some of the nice bridges and buildings of Singapore. The cruise culminates at the Merlion Park which offers a nice view of the Marina Bay Sands.
,,See the old and new,5.0,,"This is perhaps the best way to see Singapore, old and new. There are boat tours, and water taxis that will take you between Robertson, Clark, and Boat Keys, and Marina Bay and the sights in that higly modern section of this amazing city."
,,River cruise,4.0,,We did a river cruise starting from Clarke quay and we saw the whole financial district and the original Merlion then the Marina bay. The river is kept clean and well maintained. Lots of hotels facing the river too. Good for taking photos.
,,Plenty of choice,5.0,,"Robertson Quay a picturesque location by the Singapore river, with a load of restaurants offering a complete cross section of cuisines. Very local (3 minute walk) to a number of hotels including the Miramar, Havelock road."
,,A pleasant walk along the river,4.0,,"This is another downtown area that has become very trendy particularly in the evening. Again, the local authorities have made a good job in restoring the whole area, opening walking quays for pedestrians, joggers or bicycles. It is pleasant to walk to go from the Fullerton Hotel (river mouth) all the way up to Clarke Quay. Night life happens at two main locations: Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. Of course, today it is also possible to go on a river tour with a boat too."
,,Depends on your mood...,5.0,,A great evening hang out. Happy hours last quite long here. A little noisy if you are looking for a quiet meal but the ideal place if you are in the mood to party.
,,Fun and Easy,4.0,,"If you are a tourist, you will end up here. And it is a nice break from the hustle of Singapore. Enjoy the ride, learn a little history. Eat at Clarke Quay. Worth the visit."
,,The Spot for the late evening and early night.,4.0,,Clarke Quay is the spot for the later evening. Live music everywhere on a quite high level and for every taste. Will get very crowded later at night.
,,A relaxing trip up and down the river!,5.0,,We took a boat trip along the Singapore river which was very enjoyable. A great way to see the city from a different angle. Also a relaxing way after walking our feet off we could relax on the boat and take in the sights.
,,River is very nice,4.0,,Its a pretty river and all the boat tours will take you by the Merlion which is fun to see and take pictures of. Just be sure to come during the non-haze part of the year (read up on it before making your plans).
,,A Haven for Food Lovers,5.0,,"A myriad of old godowns and warehouses that haven been converted into small shops and restaurants, this area is a centre for food lovers no matter what the time of day.

The seafood restaurants here are amazing, and you can see the giant crabs and lobsters swimming in the tanks ready to be chosen and cooked fresh."
,,Pretty Nice way to escape the heat and see the finance district from the river,3.0,,"Done the boat trip on the f1 weekend, it was pretty hot down by marina bay sands so decided to get the boat back to Clarke Quay only the chap driving did not stop and we ended up back at marina bay sands.....would not let us stay on so ended up getting the mrt back. Apart from this it was a lovely little trip (went by pretty quick as he does not go much past Clarke quay."
,,"The River, the Shops, the Views",4.0,,"Cutting through the Singaporean City, the Singapore River invites tourists to chill along its banks, shops and restaurants on either side. Although it looks quite dirty and brown, no rubbish or litter can be seen in the water. Also, as the River connects Marina Bay, it gets much better.

Cruising boats and Bumboats run along the river all day and out to Marina Bay, stopping at a few stops along the river."
,,Take the Boat,5.0,,"I visited Clarke Quay - such a lot of history surrounds the area. I took a boat trip along the river, which proved really interesting as well as a beautiful way to see the city. The area is alive at night too with bars and restaurants. The area is so friendly, clean and safe - the atmosphere is fantastic."
,,A Must Do when you are in this city.,5.0,,Great trip with such interesting commentary. Worth every penny. The colours of the building is fantastic. Makes our cities look very drab by comparison.
,,Moon River,5.0,,"Did a night boat tour of the River

Best part of my stay in Singapore

Not unduly expensive, able to hop on and off, and knowledgeable staff

Plus the ribbons of moonlight playing on the water was romantic, and it was moonlight not just the neon lights of the city"
,,Coll breeze on the waves for 40 mins.,3.0,,"You get about 40 minutes if you do the route 2 which captures the Main tourist attraction in the Bay area. Marina Bay Sands hotel, Art & Science Museum, Singapore Flyer plus you can get off at one stop and rejoin another boat. S$25 per person, would have been better of it wasnt so hazy but they cant control the weather."
,,By the river walk!,4.0,,Both Boat & Clark Quays are good area to walk and enjoy the evening with nice surrounding. Boat ride mainly for tourists with lots of variety of food & drinks with pubs around this area too.
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"In Singapore you will be offered many river excursions. If you do not need a guide explaining everything then keep your cash in your pocket and use an ez card to pay for a river taxi. An ez card is a prepaid card which you use on all public transport, well worth the investment. Maximum cost of a river taxi is S$ 3 per head per trip. Very peaceful way to travel between attractions and locations."
,,Night life in singapore,5.0,,This is a small but only river in singapore . It flows in the heart of singapore . There is a cruise around it . But the best part is again evening when u can see the beautifully lighted singapore . This area has many restaurant s for every taste buds . Pubs and night life is alive here .

,,Lovely...just lovely,4.0,,You can either walk all the way up or take a hop on / hop off river bus. Comes from Marina bay Merlion..past Boat Quay...then on to Clarke Quay and then up to Robertson Quay.
,,Attractive walkaround,4.0,,"While one can take one of the many little boats to explore Sinagpore river, it is quite easy to walk around (on both sides of the river to explore more in depth) although exploring also harbor is better to do by boat. The best is to combine both - first by boat to have impression and then to walk to places one deems to be interesting to explore further."
,,"Clarke Qay is great, River view and boat cruise are excellent.",4.0,,Singapore River and Clarke Quay is great. lot of restaurants around the river. Boat cruise is available at cost. Have dinner or meal on the boat.

,,Pradise lost,2.0,,"This area has lost a lot of its former glory, was on our bucket list and was a great disappointed but had to pay over $100 for a very poor meal. Singapore is very pricy"
,,Great for a nice stroll or jog!,4.0,,"You can stroll down the entire Singapore river in less than half an hour. The river cuts through many of the key residential and nightlife areas of the city like Robertson and Clarke Quay.

You'll see individual jogging and riding bikes during the day, and couples strolling along the river at night. A great place to walk and relax after a long day exploring!"

,,Lots to see on the river,4.0,,"The water looks dirty however the river is relatively clean due to the constant clean up - we saw a boat travelling down the river with men and fishing nets collecting all the rubbish from the water.

From Clarke Quay you can take a sightseeing river cruise on Singapore River to view all the sights from the river."
,,Meandering history,5.0,,Do yourself a favour take a Bum Boat ride from Clarke Key return you will not only learn a little of history but it is a nice way to spend an hour or so.

,,Lovely views,5.0,,"Take the river boat and make sure your camera is charged.

The views are amazing during the day plus you can hope on and off which is good, plus you get to see fair abit.

At nite its even better as you are in the boat you see the city come alive from there with the buildings lite up plus if you are lucky you will see a lite show to."
,,Clean but not clear!!,3.0,,"Very clean. That's all I can say about this river. Located at the heart of the city, unlike the main river in the heart of Seoul, this river is not clear. Hence the ambience created is less comforting for tourists."
,,River side,5.0,,"great place to be in the evening, variety of Restaurants, good atmosphere till the wee hours of the morning. easy access by taxi always available"
,,Wow Wow awesome city views,5.0,,From the rice barge the views are amazing day or night and the difference makes it worth going to both times as the city changes so much and the light show at night is great
,,Excellent place,5.0,,There is plenty to see and do along the Singapore River! Boat Quay and Clarke Quay come alive at night with a lot of good food and music.
,,Great for tourist,3.0,,"I like the Quay area but very touristy. High prices, bad service and crowds. There are some good places but you really have to look to find them. If you are a tourist then you should come see the area. Eat and drink somewhere else."
,,Nice night view,4.0,,Another good place to take a walk after dinner. Feel free to grab a beer from the many bistros or pubs there. Awesome nice to chill out.
,,So much to see & do,5.0,,"Loved this area, so much to see, do, eat and drink. There are bars around Robertson Walk which is not too far from here. All within walking distance. I would stay in this area again."
,,Singapore River,4.0,,"Your journey to Singapore can not be completed without visiting the Singapore river. I had been there many times. I visited this place 8 years past and also in the year 2015. Off hours are Sundays, Saturdays and public holidays. What makes Singapore River Explorer unique? It's none other than its innovative boat design, impeccable service and strong passion in river cruising. Much of the colonial buildings and monuments that Singapore has inherited can be best viewed by taking a walk along the River or a riverboat tour that begins at Clarke Quay. Discover the grand bridges of Singapore and visit historical landmarks such as the Merlion, The Raffles Landing Site and the Esplanade."
,,Very popular restaurants and bars along the banks of the Singapore River.,4.0,,Three separate locations for eats and drinks in a very relaxed atmosphere. My favourite is Boat Quay which is within walking distance of Raffles Place and Chinatown. Be sure to bargain (eg. first round of drinks free and/or 20% off the menu price of food!). An all-weather attraction as outdoor seating is covered.
,,A must,5.0,,Had a lovely time cruising down the Quays past all the beautiful buildings. We went at night so it was very sparkly with all the lights
,,A must see place attraction,5.0,,"I am simply surprise how well designed it is for walking and bicycling around the Singapore river - from Clarke Quay to Marina Barrage. The evening or morning stroll/jog/bike along the pavement along the Singapore river uncovers beautiful architecturally designed buildings, a variety of restaurants, cafes and bars along the river, a number of museums, historical sights and shopping centres are all within walking distance to the river. This is definitely one of my favourite places to hang out in the evening in Singapore- romantic cruising, strolling and walking along the river from Clarke to Robertson Quays . Moreover, I suggest an early morning run along the river as you take in the beautiful sights and eventually stopping for breakfast in one of the air- conditioned shopping Centre e.g Clarke Quay Central or any of the local eateries along the way."
,,Not For Me,3.0,,Very busy and touristy. The price of food here is steeply expensive compared to the rest of Singapore.
,,river in the midst of central business districf,5.0,,"The river is nothing unique just that it runs through bars and restaurant street on both sides. The river itself offer boat cruise. Its ok if you have spare cash and just want to be ferried around for sight seeing. During night time, its bustling with activities from the bars, clubs and restaurant. Restaurant food are overpriced when they know you are tourists and it not worth it cos most food there is nothing good. If you like clubbing, try the novotel square where you find clubs like indochina and some of the most havoc type of clubbing. For non clubbers like me, its quite a nightmare as it's super loud."
,,A lovely way to spend our last evening.,4.0,,Had dinner here one evening. Many choices of restaurants and bars. Beautiful sights with the water taxis and all along the river all lit up. Lovely stroll after dinner.
,,Well worth a visit also great night life,5.0,,Well worth the visit. So may restaurants and shopping. We`walked from our hotel along the Singapore river practically every day.
,,Singapore River,4.0,,Singapore River is a river that locate in the center of the city...nice and clean river and from there you can enjoy many tall buildings
,,Excellent way to view the Beautiful City view of SINGAPORE!,5.0,,"excellent way to view the harbour, skyline of Singapore and re-trace the life of Singapore River, as it were of yesteryears...if only the pricing of the cruise on bumboat could be cheaper!"
,,Cruise and walk the river,5.0,,"There is so much to see along the river. Walk along the river to find the bars and restaurants and get close to the sites but take a boat for between $10 - $15 to view the bus,dings from a different perspective. It's a very pleasant trip and there's a commentary to fill in the knowledge gaps."
,,Best place for the evening,5.0,,"Very nice walk, especially the Clarke Quay part. Go in the evening, best place for outside nightlife. Reasonable prices."
,,Just 1-2 days in Singapore? Go for this one!,5.0,,"I use to live in Singapore and love to take my bike in the mornings from Robertson Quay to Marina Barrage. It was like seeing Singapore´s history in just a stroll. I did it with visitors on foot as well and it was great. You can make a lot of stops on the way! Enjoy the view at Marina Barrage, grab a skewer at Satay by the Bay, visit Gardens by the Bay, get up & shop at Marina Bay Sands, walk through the Helix bridge, go to the rooftop terrace of Esplanade Theatres and enjoy the view, continue walking along the river and make a stop for eating or drinking at Boat Quay, Clark Quay or Robertson Quay. Bring your camera, follow the locals and admire the beauty of Singapore. Duration: 2 hours without stops."
,,River city cruise best after dark.,3.0,,"We picked up the river cruise at the Marina Bay Sands water front area. Walk along to the far left after you walk through the Marina Bay Sands shopping area and arrive on the boardwalk on the river edge. We paid about $25 dollars each for a return trip through to Clarke Quay passing icons and beautiful city lights. We decided to go at night because it is too hot during the day. We weren't happy to find that the outdoor section was almost full when the boat arrived. The only reason we enjoyed outdoor seats was because we were first in line. This happens because they pick up people through out the trip, but people must get off where they got on. You must get an outdoor seat to see all the city buildings and pretty lights. It was very pleasant apart from one overbearing passenger but that can happen on any tour. The cruise was about 50mins. you can move to the outside after others get off."
,,As a walk this has a bit of everything..,4.0,,"I manage to explore the river on a daily basis over the course of 10 days and found it to be a mixed bag of quite residential living, tourist hot spots, cafe, restaurants and everything in between..

It is a pleasant walk form Clarke Quay out to the Marina Barrage, especially in the cool of the morning or evening. It is a much quieter affair in the early morning for those who like to be uninterrupted.. in the evening its a look into the comings and goings of Singapore as the work day ends, restaurants gear up..

But don't make the mistake of neglecting the area past Clarke Quay.. where there are quality cafe's and restaurants in a quiet setting with a mix of residential living. I didn't jump on the water taxi's or boat cruises.. just let my feet take me upstream and downstream..

Great to get out and about and explore if you're located nearby.."
,,A nice walk,4.0,,"The river is slow flowing, fairly small and boring but alongside it there are lots of bars and restaurants providing different cuisines. Also there are a couple of shopping centres to walk in to an cool off should you feel the need."
,,Be Careful To Get What You Want,4.0,,"We asked for the hop on and off all day option but somehow purchased a guided tour which took us up the river and brought us back again. Nevertheless, the tour was interesting and we were able to spend a few hours exploring the Marina Bay Sands area including the gardens and flower domes."
,,A great place for an evening walk,4.0,,"Instead of catching the MRT back to my hotel and walking through the back streets of Singapore I decided that I would walk along to river, even if only to check the scenery out. It is actually a really nice stroll, especially during the evening when you seen the boats with coloured lights travelling both up and down its reaches (though a part of the river was blocked off just past Clarke Quay so the boats didn't go all that far up the river. Closer to Downtown you have the Boat Quay, which is a collection of restaurants and bars in old colonial buildings, however further up you have Clarke Quay, which looks a lot newer. Further up, where my hotel was located, there was Robinson Quay, which is much quieter. If you do have the time (and if you don't, make the time) I do highly recommend a walk along the river."
,,Vibes with Taste!,5.0,,"A huge selection of restaurants of all nationalities, Clark Quay is outstanding, vibrant, alive and great for access to river boats. A super place to people watch."
,,Great nightlife,5.0,,"Heaps of cafes, eateries and pubs. Great area to sit and have a drink, watch the boats on the river and listen to a singer or band. Great to walk around."
,,Great view of Singapore,5.0,,"Great riverboat cruise, don't miss! You can see the Bay, Merlion and the Quays...totally worth the time and money"
,,absorb our rich history and sights,5.0,,"Peaceful and well paved walkways, right in city center. If you need some fresh air before dinner time or a morning jog, this is a good place to visit"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"We walked the whole length from Robertson Quay to Marina Bay in about 45 minutes. The style of each area you pass through is very different. Clarke's Quay, Raffles landing, old waterfront buildings to gleaming new towers. Thoroughly enjoyable walk."
,,Beautiful river bank,5.0,,"Not very big river. But many high-rises built on the bank of this river. They look very beautiful, due to presence of this small river."
,,Very nice walk if it isn't too hot,4.0,,If it's a very nice walk if it's not too hot what easily could be the case in Singapore. The river is known as one of the signs of Singapore before the Marina Bay was built.
,,Great Photo Opportunities,5.0,,There are a fee different companies to choose from. But they all have guides and commentary in English. The view of the city and and Marina Bay Sands and surrounds are fantastic. Bring your camera
,,A stunning walk,5.0,,"So lovely to walk along the river both day and at night. We walked each evening from Marina Bay, The Fullerton by the river to Clark Quay, stopping off for ice creams on the way."
,,Singapore River,3.0,,"Walked down near the Singapore River a couple of times during our 2 week holiday, its not a bad area, not a lot of shade so it very hot during the day better to night when its a bit cooler."
,,Muddy yet attractive!,4.0,,"I happened to cross this river many times, cruized one time. Water is not very clean, yet banks are very attractive because of many eateries, night life, and many beautiful bridges"
,,The landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"The river is the most admired by taking a walk all along the river and ending at the ocean front . Best time is to visit either at dawn and at sunset time . The cruise too takes people but , best us walking along leasurly and have a sundowner at the sunset time . Fancy eateries lined up offering a variety of food - mostly pricey fancy shops ."
,,Nice but not mind blowing.,3.0,,We went in the afternoon and were not impressed but at night it is likely much nicer when everything is lit up. Walking along the river is really nice so the cruise is more for those that don't get around as well.
,,Worth an evening visit,5.0,,"worth a visit because we will surely be to the merlion, the famous statue, on its banks.. boating is optional"
,,Nice Singapore River!,4.0,,"This is a good location for tourist! many shopping area, many Pub at night for people who can watch the river scenery , talking , drinking and dancing. There are river taxi (boat) can tour along the river and have many nice views! Good choice!"
,,Singapore River Walk,4.0,,"Excellent walk along the river, with all the restaurants, river boats, and the Merlion viewing platform. The river is kept clean. There are bridges along so one can cross - incl foot bridges. Try the walk from the Riverview Hotel to Merlion. It can be a bit hectic with all the restaurants trying to hook you in :-). We'll be back.
Niels & Mary, Humpty Doo, NT, Australia, Down Under"
,,Nice for a walk!,4.0,,"Singapore river flows right in the middle of the city and passes through various parts of the town. Walking along the Singapore riverfront is a very pleasant experience and this walk also takes you through the important sites of Singapore.

There was also an option of River Cruise for 40$ approx. I chose not to do the same.

If you are looking out to see Singapore from a different perspective, do go for this walk."
,,Best place for a eve walk...!,5.0,,Nice background to stay and good for a evening walk. Me and my husband walked through this paths around the river. Such a marvellous experience.
,,Take A Stroll Along The Historic River,5.0,,"The Singapore river played an important part of Singapore's history, where early traders plied their trade along its banks. Even Sir Stamford Raffles who founded Singapore landed on its banks back in the 19th century.

The river used to be polluted and its now clean with many boats plying the river, affording visitors a view of the city skyline and buildings along the river.

Take a stroll along the river and you can see the changing landscape from Boat Quay to Clarke Quay.

You can also take boat rides to afford a different view of the river.

Visit it!"
,,museums pubs,5.0,,"some pics I took.... Hope u like it..., travelled on river cruise too. see the river from another perspective... expensive though. last pic of how crowded the airport is. long queue b4 we took off."
,,NATURES DELIGHT,5.0,,"It was a very nice and refreshing place in Singapore between many famous buildings like Marina Bay Sands,The Flyer,etc."
,,River in the town,4.0,,"Singapore river is very near my hotel (I live in China town this time), it only takes around 20mins to there. After we had a drink in Clarke park, we walked back to hotel along the river."
,,great trip,5.0,,we went on this tour 3 times in all. saw new things each time .went night and day. left from quay . Can be a little difficult getting onboard if elderly. You are given help but be very careful
,,A nice walk at night,4.0,,"The best time to walk there is at night or to take a river cruise to look at the beautiful builds along the way. You will pass through the Merlion statue, the business district, Marina Bay and Clark Quay. At night, you will enjoy Singapore beautiful skyline."
,,A view of history,4.0,,"A walk along the Singapore River waterfront is a good way to see the city skyline and also follow the history of the river. You can walk on both sides of the river along a shady path called the Queen Elizabeth Walk. Bronze street art, the Merlion, historic bridges, colonial hotels,museums, Raffles landing site, statues and great views make this an interesting way to view Singapore especially in the cool of the morning."
,,Nice,4.0,,"The Singapore river isn't a must see, but it's a nice area with a lot of the city skyline around it. There's a building here with a boat on the top... And Merilon park is on the river as well."
,,pretty and busy,4.0,,"we took a river cruise down river to The Flyer then back up river passed the Merlion, Raffles, the old GPO and the Fullerton complex. Reasonable price and very relaxing."
,,A Twilight Experience,5.0,,"We prefer to take the boat road, during the twilight or coincide it with the water show a Marina Bay Sands. A ride down the Singapore river is an amazing experience as you witness the architectural marvels on either side of the river."
,,CONNECTED TO SO MUCH!!!!!,5.0,,"Singapore river is like the heart of Singapore, or at least one of its vital organs.

From the river cruises to the shopping centres, to the amazing Merlion statue, to all the amazing restaurants that line the river.

A MUST DO for everyone who visits Singapore."
,,Food destination,4.0,,"miss the satay and other stalls that used to be in Clarke Quay. The trip down the river is still worth doing, good to see the city from the river. Nice ti see that the shophouses have been retained, they are so much part of Singapore 's previous life."
,,Good trip at sundown.,4.0,,"We have been advised by our hotel to go at sundown, great idea. The nightlights makes for great photos. The trip took 40 minutes, and was very informative."
,,singapore review,4.0,,I strolled across the singapore short bridge and was pleasant. The river is clean and good for sightseeing
,,Clean and good views,5.0,,"Good place to spend some time.You can see the boats buzzing about,lined with a mix of building and varied districts.Cant miss in Singapore."
,,beautiful night scenery,5.0,,"Try to go to Singapore river when it's night. It's really beautiful and romantic. If you are hungry, you can go to Boat Quay area. There are so many seafood store over there. Many tourists love these spot!!"
,,Very smooth river!!,5.0,,The cruise down the river was lovely and smooth. English commentary was great. We went all around the harbour front stopping at the merlion. It was a shame they didn't also stop at the marina side but you can get off at Merlion and take the short walk around. The total time was about 40 minutes and a different way to see Singapore.
,,Another view of Singapore attractions,5.0,,"We bought 3days Singapore Tourist Pass Plus, which in addition to free MRT and busees includes a free hop on -hop off bus funvee and about 1,5 hours river boat tours. From the boat you can experiencing the greatest sights and attraction of the city - Merlion, Promenade, Fullerton hotel, Marina Bay, Raffles place, bridges, Riverside and many other."
,,River down history,3.0,,The river that started the trading of singapore. But if you are walking along singapore river there is no longer the bustling since like the open days. whats left is the bronze statues and signboard that tell you whats once its like here. singapore river stretch from boat quay to the deeper part of the singapore. good to walk in the night and enjoy the breeze and also look at tourist sitting in the tugboat and saying hello to you.
,,A fun way to see the city.,4.0,,The river cruise is definitely a must if you want to see the heart of the city and its historic downtown. We enjoyed the guided boat tour and the sights and sounds of the crowded restaurants that line its quays.
,,From Merlion to Clarke Quay,4.0,,"Walking along the Singapore River from Merlion and Marina Bay to Clarke Quay is a treat we always indulge when in Singapore. There is much to enjoy; the view over Marina Bay, the contrast between the skyscrapers and the Chinese shophouses, a shopping mall (Clarke Quay Central) and more restaurants than you can shake a stick at. A Singapore River walk is almost a mandatory activity for the serious Singapore tourists. And if you don't like to walk you can always book a river cruise."
,,Depends upon the weather,3.0,,"Boats are decent,the view are okayish compared to what can be seen from other parts of singapore.If the weather is good you'll love it otherwise not so much."
,,Peaceful sightseeing for foot weary,4.0,,"There are several convenient stops for the Singapore River cruises and you can hop on and off for S$30 a day or just pay S$22 for the 40 minute cruise. I usually jog this route in the morning but by afternoon I'm tired enough to just enjoy the boat with taped commentary of the more salient highlights along the way. My boat captain was a little too loud, drowning out the tape from time to time but aside from that, an excellent way to spend some time in Singapore."
,,Nice break from walking!,4.0,,"My family decided to hop on one of the cruises at Clarke Quay when the 11 & 14 swore they could not walk another step! Whilst the commentary was a bit kitschy in parts, it was an enjoyable 40 minute ride seeing Singapore from the river and interesting to hear a few tidbits about its interesting history."
,,"Do a river cruise, just NOT Singapore River Experience, which is a 1-star, at best, rating",4.0,,"After walking so much of Singapore, it was a terrific idea to enjoy the city from the water. It would have been excellent with a good water tour. Unfortunately, Singapore River Experience was NOT great.

First, Singapore River Experience is $22 cash only. Also, we had Singapore $43 cash, which was $1 short, and the gal taking our money was trying to tell us that if we paid US $44 it was the same as Singapore $44. NOT correct! She ended up having us pay $5 US for $1 Singapore - NOT a fair deal! In other words, we paid S$43 and US$5 - OVERPAYING the stated price. However, we had no other cash and wanted to take the tour.

Second, the tour itself was not marked inside the boat, so we had no idea what stops we were making or where we were going. Having a simple marking inside the boat would have been fantastic.

Finally, the seats were wooden with no padding, so it is a good 20 minute trip but too long after that, since it is not at all comfortable.

Also, for the best view, sit next to the window and lean out to look outside. Otherwise, the entire skyscraper view is lost since the boat is completely covered.

Had we found any other boat tour available, we would have taken that, and had a much better experience. Avoid Singapore River Experience unless you want bad service and a horrible value."
,,Magical Boat Trip,5.0,,"We went with Float@thebay on one of their bar boats , clean and modern and very uncrowded. It cost 38 Singapore dollars per person, but we decided good value as we had a drink of our choice included and the tour lasted well over an hour. The laser light show was amazing with beautiful music too. The skipper of our boat was skilled and made sure everyone on the boat had plenty of chances for splendid views and photo opportunities. Staff friendly and helpful. Definitely recommended."
,,River Cruise is very enjoyable,5.0,,This is certainly worth doing on a visit to Singapore. There are many little boats doing this cruise from Clarks Quay and it isn't overcrowded. The view of Marina Bay Sands from the water is worth the trip on its own.
,,"The river cruise, worth every cent.",4.0,,A serene environment. A calm river. And a mindblowing boat ride. This is the description in a nutshell. The ride costs you $22 per person and is a 40 min journey. But it is worth it. Highly recommended.
,,Great walk along the quays,4.0,,"Brilliant walk along the river and quays, great choice of boat trips, bars or restaurants along the whole length of the river. Singapore is a vibrant city built around traditional Colonial buildings and brand new skyscrapers with loads of building work going on. The City is very clean with a great sense of safety as you walk around. Great place to visit."
,,Riverwalk Excitement,4.0,,"I spent two hours walking along the Singapore River and could not get enough of it even when I was hot and dehydrated from my time outdoors. I walked from the mouth of the river near the Fullerton Hotel all the way to Clarke Quay. One of the parts I enjoyed the most was the scenic Boat Quay that reminded me of crazy party times in Old Singapore.

All of the restaurants were quiet in the late afternoon, but seemed to offer great snacks and drinks for discounted happy hour prices. I enjoyed thinking of the historical aspects of this river and all of the bridges built across it. This is a very enjoyable, free activity in Singapore central."
,,Alternative to a taxi ride,4.0,,This is a pleasant cruise down a river that used to be a cesspool and is now been reclaimed as reservoir for water for the city. Is a peaceful little float via electric motor from point A to point B that gets you a chance to sort of absorb the city from a different era
,,Lack lustre river,2.0,,"A very quiet river with that needs an injection of life put into it. We only walked from the Merlion statue to Clarke Quay, which I guess is the furthest most tourist would walk, and our eyes were drawn more to the surrounding buildings than the river itself. Apart from two tourist boats and a small bumboat being used to pick up debris from the water, there were no other vessels to be seen. In contrast to other rivers this river was quiet dead, especially on the bank nearest Parliament. Some of the bridges crossing the river were actually of more interest than than the river itself. It could do with more boats of interest, or floating restaurants, to be moored there to bring the area to life. I'm sure some typical colourful Chinese type vessels, possibly a floating market, would liven the area up. We certainly didn't take any of the boat rides as we found we could get equally good views from strolling to the various vista points along the river and in the Marina itself."
,,River taxi/River cruise,4.0,,"We did the sky park at the top of the Marina Sands. It was evening- we were tired and really wanted to see the merlion fountain up close but didn't want to walk all the way over there. So a water taxi seemed ideal- they assured us we'd go right by it.

Well...the ticket person explained because it was after 9pm it's technically not a water taxis any more so we had to pay the full cruise"" price. So instead of $3 we each had to pay $22. Ok we figured it was a nice evening, why not? Strike #1

We got onto the boat first and headed to the very back outside. Then this huge group of people all got onto the boat and also crammed into the very back with us. There was plenty of room inside but no...everyone had to crowd to the back even though at this point there was no place to sit. Then the screaming started- their little kids wanted to go inside. But no...make us all suffer. Strike #2

We didn't go anywhere NEAR the darn merlion- which was the whole pint of taking the river taxis/cruise in the first lace. Strike #3.

Ugh...just not what we expected.

But there was an upside. Between the screams the view was beautiful and I did enjoy gliding over the calm water. I got some great night shots of the lights and saw a part of Singapore I hadn't seen yet. So there's that.

If I had to do it all over again I would have done the whole cruise and got my money's worth, But it was so late and we were tired so we got off at Clarkes Quay and continued to the hotel."
,,Night time cruise to see light show,4.0,,"We took a river cruise from Clarke Quay to see the music, water and lights shows at Marina Sanda hotel. There was plenty of seats on the boat and you were able to get a good view from any seat. Was lovely seeing the city all lit up in the evening."
,,Simply Amazing!,5.0,,The cruise was beautiful at night. Watch Singapore come alive! Well worth the money and a breath-taking view of modern architecture
,,No Soul,3.0,,"My initial impression of the river was; ""Wow, this is nice!"" Then I began walking alongside it and began to feel like something was missing - the soul of the river was gone...gone with the river's cleanup 30-odd years ago. Yes, the river is clean and tidy, but to me it seemed artificial. All of the old shophouses are upscale/trendy bars and restaurants. There were hardly any boats (aside from a couple of tourist boats) and there was a general lack of activity as I had expected - this surely isn't Victoria Harbor!"
,,Night or day..well worth the trip,4.0,,"You see a different side to Singapore from the river. We found the cruise to be very well organised with a good commentary and friendly and helpful staff. It provides an opportunity to see both the old and the new and given the slow speed of the boat , you get ample opportunity to see the variety of architecture along the river. The river experience cost $22 per person and we boarded near the Merlion although there are other places to board. Look out for a sculpture of small boys jumping into the river and, of course, the statue of Raffles. On one bank you will see some interesting chinese shop houses built there because it was deemed to be a lucky place. The detail on some of the bridges is worth a close look.
At night time, the river takes on a different dimension with the floodlit buildings of the financial district and Marina Bay with the futuristic science museum building.
Make sure you camera battery is fully charged!"
,,Great place for a short cruise or a walk,5.0,,Just get off at Marina Bay and walk 2 min under a covered path way and you can have a nice walk along the river. Perfect on a sunny day.
,,Singapore River night cruise,4.0,,"You must take you camera. The views of Singapore at night from the river are awe expiring.
Our small Bumboat held about 40 or so passengers and cruised slowly toward the mouth of the river and back. It took about 1 hour and was well worth the experience."
,,"Not organized, waste of time",1.0,,"There was a boat waiting at the dock and although the four attendants told us another boat was coming, we waited over a half an hour until more people came. It was all about filling up the boat before leaving. We finally realized no boat was coming after six Germans walked away four British people walked away and finally they lost 2 Americans for business. We demanded a refund and they told us where taxi stand was. This is a touristy thing to do and you could be seeing all of Singapore instead of waiting for a boat in the heat. For a fraction of the price you can find a taxi and see more highlights. It is unorganized, a waste of time, and money in an already expensive city."
,,Muddy,3.0,,"The river itself is really nothing special, but a walk along the river front should be part of any itinerary for a visitor to Singapore. Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, and even Robertson Quay all give a good taste of what the river is like. You can take ""water taxi"" trips along the river at relatively low cost: no need to take those expensive tours."
,,Fun light show.,4.0,,A quick walk to Clark Quay from our hotel was the ticket office. $22 for a 40 minute trip along the river or $30 to stop in the river at Marina Sands Hotel tomwatch the light show. It was very nice to get a different view of Singapore from the water. There is a recorded commentary running which is helpful. I enjoyed the trip.
,,Always something to see along the way,4.0,,"I woke up early to run along the river from Clarke Quay to Marina bay and I found good scenery and weather. Always something to see along the way like tall buildings, some sculptures and bridges. Relaxing environment during the day and there are also some fun to do during the night. Spending night life listening to great music and going to cool pubs as well as restaurants at Clarke quay is always a good idea."
,,Best to go at night,4.0,,You'll enjoy the river cruise better when you go at night time. Much better if you go during sunset. The tour is very informative too. Additional S $8 dollar of you opt for the Marina Bay laser show but in my opinion is not worth it. The regular tour at sunset is enough. A lot of nice views. A great way to start your Singapore tour
,,Ridiculous ticketing system,2.0,,"I have spent a lot of time in Singapore and used to love catching the water taxi, but now they have made it really difficult to use as you have to have one of those public transport cards but you can't buy them at the taxi stops. So if you walk down to the river from your hotel, you can't just hop on the taxi as there is nowhere around to buy a card.
If you are going to force tourists to use the cards, then it really makes sense to sell them at the stops."
,,bum boat cruise,5.0,,very relaxing and informative. Great to get a history of the place and to see the old and the new coming together. Great photo opportunities. We got off and went for a walk around Clarke Quay great shopping especially the ice cream yum yum ...
,,Activity Plus,5.0,,Singapore River is home to the main Restaurant and Nightlife precinct known as Clarke Quay. There is always something to see along the Singapore River whether you walk or go for a jog.
,,Great way to see the city,4.0,,"Having explored the city by road on the Hop On Hop Off bus it was great to see the city from the river and bay on this boat cruise. You will find lots of things that you do not see from the road which tempt you to explore more on foot, such as the statue of Sir Stamford Raffles and the sculpture of boys jumping into the river."
,,River Wonderland,4.0,,"Take a boat, eat crabs in sweet chile sauce, walk along the river and see the wonderful shops, attractions, and sites. Easy walk to China town for great food or shopping."
,,Very busy,4.0,,Was part of a tour the area is very nice but charge a premium for food and drinks in this area. Is also a local place that people go to when we visited there was a local wedding photo shoot going on.
,,Go at night,4.0,,The nightlife along the river (Boat Quay) is fantastic. I'd say the riverside's a little dead in the day.
,,I love it: what would Singapore be without its river?,5.0,,"Singapore River with beautiful quays like Boat Quay, Clark Quay and Robertson Quay represents the city's well being in history but also nowadays. Walk along the river and enjoy the many restaurants and bars, take notice of the old merchant houses build when the river was the harbour of the city and wonder about the vigour of a city that is capable of building in such a short period so many iconographic architectural highlights."
,,Lovely river,5.0,,It is a nice feeling to see part of singapre feom this view. Relaxing and lovely day to spend a day in simgapore
,,Great For Relaxing,5.0,,"Singapore River is Centrally located ,connecting to major Tourist Attractions along it & close by. It is almost a 24 hrs attraction .Regular River Cruises with good Guides provides nice opportunity to see many historical places along the River from Robertson Quay right upto the Iconic Merlion from where one has a fantastic view of Marina Bay Sands. It is great for morning walks with cool & fresh air all around . Both sides of the River have innumerable bars , pubs , restaurants, some of which start functioning from Breakfast on wards and carry on till late night . Variety of Restaurants cater to almost all the well known International cuisines but Sea Food is the most popular .
There are hotels along both banks which are popular with all , particularly with tourists . Multi Brand Malls are another good attraction while going along the River.Accessibility to the River is easy with good Public Transport from either side of the River."
,,The perfect place to spend the night,5.0,,"There are many good, fine restaurants by the river. Just go there, and chill. You'll have a great feeling due to the splendid view you'll see. You'll never regret. If you have time, just walk by the river with your friends or family. It's nice and pleasant."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"That was so much fun and so much to see. I also took some fabulous photographs which I am framing to hang in my new home. I can recommend this to everyone, a great way to see the night lights and many historical sites."
,,A stroll in the evening,3.0,,"A good place for a peaceful stroll in the evening with friends, solo or with pets. I did see some boats/ water taxis plying the river but didn't manage to try one. There are some bridges on the river, which might be worth walking. Didn't try that as well."
,,Fantastic viewpoint,5.0,,My. Wife and I found this view of the river to be excellent abd we thoroughly enjoyed the trip qhich we did in the morning.thinking of doing it again at night
,,Never knew there r murals streetart and graffiti in this country!,5.0,,Under the tunnels by the river check one out specially opposite the reverse bungee jumping attraction and just when u stepped out from the train station There are portraits and faces of Queen Elizabeth the coolie a lion and a Samsui woman etc all bigger than life sizes
,,Walking tour of Singapore river,3.0,,NTU students conduct a free walking tour at 1630 hrs. We went on a Saturday. It lasts for about 1.5 hrs. They take you to all the major attractions along the river. Suitable for old people too...
,,Outdoor in Singapore,5.0,,"I've recommended this route to so many visitors that I felt I should include a review here. If you have a day in Singapore that you do not want to spend shopping, do take a stroll around the Singapore River. I've been here many times, for walks and jogs, and still never tire of it. You can customise your distance, the entire loop of 10 km comprising the Marina Bay area (with views of the Merlion, Esplanade and Flyer), Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, Robertson Quay and Kim Seng Park (which brings you near another mall, Great World City).
Mornings lend a comfortable air to the stroll as everything is greener and air fresher. There are some breakfast options; I'd recommend Robertson Quay. After 9 am, it gets pretty warm so, unless you don't mind sweating buckets and getting an uneven tan, I'd suggest you pop into a mall (or two).
I prefer the evenings for the River walk due to the warm weather here for a food-cum-sights-cum-exercise expedition and there's a bonus of the beautiful streaky sky from the setting sun. Shops are aplenty and there are malls along the way too. Food, here being Singapore, can be found at almost every corner. The walk's all free, of course. I like how the scene changes from one part of the River to the next.
If you want to cover more, you can include the Gardens By The Bay or even Marina Barrage. Conversely, if the full perimeter is too much, you can select a segment, say the Marina Bay area, which is about 3km. Otherwise, a shorter section could be the historical Boat Quay which includes the statue of Sir Stamford Raffles and many lovely sculptures (my favourites being the cats and the boys jumping into the water). Clarke Quay, home to the reverse bungee, is lively and fun, often with buskers or ad hoc fairs set up on the big wide bridge. Robertson Quay and Kim Seng Park is the quieter end of the River but no less attractive with different bridges against the backdrop of condominiums and quaint hotels. With many residents frequently walking their dogs, it feels like a hidden alcove that's unlike typical busy Singapura."
,,Relaxing in busy Singapore,5.0,,"There are different parts of the river you can visit and most people will always come and walk between the Fullerton hotel and Clark Quay. Here you can see the statues of people of the river, Sir Stamford Raffles statue, Mica buildings and Asian Civilization Museum building. There are numerous eateries you can sit, eat and watch the river. A good way to see the river and its surrounds is by a bumboat and at night."
,,Mixture of Happening & Historic,5.0,,"Singapore river used to be an import & export area for transporting goods from all over the world during 18/19 century and there were a lot of warehouses along the river. But as times fly what you can see now is a lot of Pubs , Restaurants .... gone was those warehouses that used to store all those goods but now it was already converted into Pubs/Restaurants... surrounding buildings like Parliament building, Fullerton Hotel (formal Singapore General Post Office), Melion was well preserved and new buildings like Marina Bay Sand, Esplande ... that was built recently was a must see attractions that you should not miss ... try to take a boat cruise at night along Singapore River and you will enjoy the scenery ..."
,,Nice historic walk,5.0,,"It's lovely to walk by the river and enjoy the historic part of SG.

Tip: Start walking from the opposite side of Boat Quay, next to Parliament House. This route will lead you all the way to Esplanade. If you have energy, you can continue walking all the way by the river to Marina Bay Sands, pass Gardens by the Bay anr all the way to Marina Barrage.

Best time will be in the evening. Upon passing Gardens by the Bay, you can have dinner at Satay by the Bay."
,,Foodie time,4.0,,Good location to relax n enjoy scenery. Theres lots of restaurant. A bit expensive but in a good price and taste
,,A little perspective,3.0,,"A little perspective peeps. The Singapore River is hardly going to be remembered in the annals of history as one of the mighty rivers of the world. Effectively it is a seemingly non flowing body of water that only gets as far as the Marina area now. Which on the other hand make it perfect for a gentle little cruise along on one of the tourist boats (quick aside - I saw a tourist sit on one of these and then at the end blast one of the staff for how loud the sound of the host was - silly cow hadn't thought of moving to a seat NOT under a speaker apparently).

These boats generally give you a quick chance to see some of the riverside buildings and then take you into the marina area for a quick look at the Merlion there. And they aren't cheap, but they do allow a chance to see the Merlion from a different perspective as well as Anderson Bridget etc.

The other option is to walk by the river, check out some of the statues and buildings along its banks and grab a lovely lunch/dinner/snack/whatever. It isn't polluted which speaks volumes for the efforts of the city authorities to clean it up and it shows a bit of civic pride.

But at the end it is just a non-descript river. So I can only award three stars."
,,A great place of taking a walking and enjoying the city cruise,4.0,,"This is a great place to walk around and see building, statues and some of the history of singapore. you can walk this area and stop and get a bite to eat or something to drink. You can also see the Merlion from here. We also took the river ride which was great because you see many things from the water and it gives a chance to relax after walking around for a long thing. The boat stopped at the Marina Bay Sands and that was great."
,,Scenic Singapore Stroll,4.0,,"We strolled along the Singapore River and were pleased with the views of historical buildings and modern skyscrapers. There are many interesting statues and sculptures, including a Botero bird and a group of bronze children jumping in the river! At the mouth of the river one has a great view of the Merlion statue/fountain and the fantastic Marina Bay Sands towers. Perhaps not as intimate as the Riverwalk in San Antonio and not as charming as the canals of Venice, but a very pleasant stroll through the heart of Singapore."
,,Life Line of Singapore,5.0,,Singapore River is said to be lifeline of Singapore. Most of the attractions are build around this river. The best way to experience the beauty of river to take a 45 minutes river cruise. the River cruise takes you to 12 important points in the area with running commentary. A must visit for every one.
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,4.0,,"Whether it is single trips ($3, $4 or $7) or 24hrs of hop on hop off ($30) this is a relaxing scenic way to get around Singapore. It is worth doing both by day and by night. From Clarke Quay to Clifford ($3) you pick up all the main city sights and at night the river comes to life. From Clifford to the Barrage($4) you see the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens, the Domes, the Flyer and the city buildings from great perspective - go to the Barrage rather than just to Marina Bay Sands it is worth it! And if you're going to the gardens it is nor further to walk to the gardens along the waterfront from the barrage and you get to pass Satay by The Bay (cheapest food and drink in the area). Hop on hop off worked really well for us to explore the barrage, the gardens, boat quay and Clarke quay and to see the light and sound show at the gardens at 7.45pm and the light show in Marina Bay. Really safe way to travel at night but don't miss the last boat!"
,,Lovely.,4.0,,"While not being that wide a river, it's still a nice one. See if you can take a boat ride (or an amphibian bus ride) on the river, while being VERY touristic, is still a lot of fun."
,,"Relax, enjoy, so worth it!",5.0,,"Having travelled along many world famous rivers in cities, I can honestly say this was one of the most enjoyable.
Catch a River Taxi and either sit back and watch the world go by in all it's colour and splendour, or hop on and off and go exploring.
We used 3 different types of River Taxis and all were cheap and excellent value.
I think A trip to Singapore is not complete without a trip down this beautiful River and into the bay.
It's clean and has wildlife including a giant turtle!"
,,Great walk,5.0,,"We spent the whole day and most of the evening walking and exploring the Singapore River. We walked from Robertson Quay, Clark Quay, Fort Canning, The Asian Civilization Museum, The Esplanade, Gardens By the Bay, Maria Barge, back to The Maria Bay Sands for the fire works....great day, exhausted but a great day."
,,"Interesting for its history. Beware over-hyped ""attractions.""",3.0,,"The Singapore River is interesting for its history.

Whether its current state of ""restoration"" (IMHO, ""redevelopment"" is a more accurate description) is attractive is a matter of taste. To my view, the current condition of the river could be described as ""semi-uninspired holding pattern"" until a truly inspired, less commercialized, use of space can be designed and implemented.

Read the other reviews in this thread. They cover some of the more ""commercially hyped"" pseudo-attractions that might be pushed on a visitor. Though I occasionally check out the Singapore River area (since my first visit decades ago), I am never tempted to take such hyped pseudo-attractions. Don't be sucked into such commercial pseudo-attractions unless, from prior research (before coming here) you decide that they are just perfect for you."
,,River with a history,5.0,,"We all know the first settlement in singapore was all along the singapore river. Needless to say, the river is an important part of singapore's history. Look out for sir Stamford raffles statue, and the Victoria Theatre hall."
,,thats a river?,4.0,,The river is now so constructed - that's its a large pool .. Take the regular taxi and avoid the cost and the commentary - and easy economical trip in nay case and one not to miss
,,See the river from the water,4.0,,"I decided to walk around the Singapore River area. While that was OK, I think seeing the sights from a river cruise would be preferable. I came back at night to Clarke Quay, which was the right time to visit on foot."
,,Nice view of the river from the Fullerton Hotel,4.0,,"The Singapore River is the artery brings life to Singapore. It forms part of the Marina Reservoir, storing a vital supply for the country.

I stay during my trip to the Fullerton Hotel and have the chance to have a great view of the River. For example, from the Swimming pool or the Town Restaurant (nice terrace).

Lot of nice and old bridge also among the River.

Try for example to hope on a River Taxi, which is the easiest way to travel up or down the river and learn about its illustrious history."
,,Great views of the old and modern Singapore,4.0,,"This is a great area to walk along and look at the different faces of Singapore. The old buildings on the river, plus the old bridge show some of the history of Singapore. We took a river cruise and viewed new and old Singapore from the water. Next time I would buy one of the hop on, hop off tickets and explore the whole area. Well worth the time spent here. The river cruise also goes right out into Marina Bay. There are a large number of restaurants along the river bank and you can choose from many different cuisines. The bronze statues along the river bank are really well done, the best of all the young boys jumping into the water."
,,Great Place to Stroll,4.0,,"I recall when I was looking at the displays in the Singapore History Museum that it indicated that the Singapore River was a virtual cesspool until the 1980s when they dredged it and cleaned it up. You would never know that now as it is one of the nicest urban river walks I have ever experienced. There are several commercial quays along the river that break up your walk with the opportunity to duck into restaurants and shops. If you are in Singapore, it is worth taking a stroll along the river."
,,good place to hangout,3.0,,lots of restaurants and performers. good place to meet up with friends. the area is clean . cleaner than our rivers in the Philippines
,,Nice place for the family to explore,4.0,,We stayed in the Clarke Quay area and walked along the river daily. Very safe area with street performers at night. Also a very good place to go for a run with underpasses to avoid having to cross the main roads and lots of bridges to make the route as short or long as you want.
,,The fascinating aspect of the Singapore River,4.0,,"The Singapore River is the river that runs all the way from the source to the sea near Marina Bay. Years ago it was dirty and smelly. Today it is a clean river and now tourists' boats ply along the river to allow tourists a glimpse of the river front. The new MRT station near Fort Canning is built below the Singapore River. The river comes alive at night because revealers come to the pubs here to drink till the wee hours of the morning. You can view a video of the Singapore River on You Tube at the website:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVokEdk3-wU"
,,Walk up from the Fullerton Hotel,4.0,,"Despite the blazing heat, we enjoyed a stroll up the Singapore River to Clarke Quay. Underpasses help you avoid the fatally fast traffic. We stop for a look around Clarke Quay in the daytime when the revellers weren't in attendance. My partner enjoyed a break in the Central Mall. You can take a boat back down form the main quay near here. Don't miss the Dali sculpture under the UOB Centre. Note Raffles landing spot just near the Asian Cultures Museum as well as the busts of Nehru, Ho Chi Minh and Deng Xiao Ping. Afternoon tea at the Fullerton Hotel is not to be missed."
,,The number one thing to do in Singapore...,5.0,,"The title of this review says it all.....if you only do one thing when you are in Singapore, the Singapore River is it. The River is about 3km long and tourists would be interested in the main section from Robertson Quay up to, and around, Marina Bay. All along the river, on both sides, are bars, pubs, restaurants, shops, museums, hotels, etc. You can find food to suit every taste. It is great to walk along here both in the daytime and in the nighttime. It's also a great jogging track but go early in the morning when there is no one around (at night there are too many people to enjoy your run). You can easily reach the River by MRT (Clarke Quay station). Bring your camera as there are numerous beautiful photos you can take. You'll want to wear comfortable shoes and allot a lot of time for this as there's so much to see. Highly recommend this as the best thing to do in Singapore."
,,River of importance...,4.0,,Singapore River is approximately three kilometers long. The source at Kim Seng Bridge and stretch thru Esplanade to the Strait Sinagpore. Most of the place of attraction is established near or around the river. Its the center of commercial activity those days and to this day.
,,Quiet peaceful place,5.0,,We lived in Holiday Inn Atrium so the River was close. It's a little bit away from touristic Clarke Que so this part of the River is quiet but still beautiful. Very pleasant to walk in the evening.
,,Nice Riverwalk from Clark Quay to Marina Bay,4.0,,"We visit Singapore from time to time and almost always find ourselves walking along the Singapore River between the area of Clark Quay and Marina Bay. This is a nice area to spend some time when in S'pore.

The Clark Quay area of the river is very nice. There are boats slowly cruising up and down the river waters and there always seems to be a happy vibe that present around the Quay. You can find many restaurants, bars, shops and a generally pleasant atmosphere here. There is also an exciting Reverse Bungy attraction as well. We have enjoyed watching over the years but have never tried ourselves.

Nowadays, you can see the Marina Bay Sands Hotel from this area and can catch the 8pm or 9.30pm laser light show from here, mind you its quite far so you don't see that much. From Clark Quay, you can walk towards Marina Bay which is no more than 30 minutes away, even with a slow leisurely stroll.

From Clark Quay, you can begin walking towards Marina Bay and you'll encounter Boat Quay in 8-10 minutes. On the southern side of the river, there is a host of riverside restaurants and sometimes aggressive touts trying to persuade you into their restaurant. We usually cross and walk the along the northern side for this reason. This side is very nice and peaceful, great for evening and night walks. And 'Yes' - it is very safe to do so.

In this area, you can find the famous Sir Samford Raffles Statue and the nice Asian Civilisations Museum (if visting during the day). Eventually the river pours into what is now called Marina Bay. Here you are welcomed by the iconic Merlion statue, afforded some great views of the bay area.

Overall, we find this a most enjoyable walk to make in the evenings once it has cooled down a bit. You can reverse this walk as well, starting in the Marina Bay area and making your way to Clark Quay."
,,Excellent Sight. ..,4.0,,"The walk along the river is an excellent way to discover some of the most interesting places in Singapore. . Like the Merlion, Boat Quay and Clarke Quay, where all the restaurant's are located, needless to say not to be missed. ..If walking is not on the cards you can do the Hippo tour. One can also do a boat ride in the River, economical and will provide you some breathtaking views of the Singapore Sky line, abd the Marina Bay Sands."
,,Simply excellent,5.0,,It does not matter w when or why you are in Singapore. Any time is a good tine for a walk up and down. You can also do this by boat. The sights and sounds are entertaining day or night. I am always drawn to this river on every visit.
,,Very Modern,4.0,,"Singapore is a very modern city with many skyscrapers. The river area is a charming area amidst all these tall buildings. The Merlion, the symbol of Singapore is on the river and attracts many people wanting to take pictures of themselves with the background of the Merlion. In a city of hustle and bustle this area is serene and relaxing."
,,do this by boat at night,5.0,,"Seeing the river by boat is a very relaxing way to spend an hour,the views are just breath taking. We bought a 2 day hop on hop off bus trip with the citysightseeing bus company and this was a part of the ticket...just awesome by night, the river at its best."
,,Sunday Lunch Or Late Night Fun,4.0,,"You have a plethora of venues for eating, drinking, partying or crowd watching. Low key lunch watching the tourist boats glide by, or full on catch up with friends!"
,,a leisure afternoon,4.0,,"this is a good place to walk by the singapore river and enjoy the view as the river boats cruises by. there are lots of restaurants to choose from the local to western style. starbucks is around the corner!!
mrt trains below(undergound) or public buses.
spend a couple of hours or the evening for a leisure day by the river......."
,,Just a normal river,3.0,,"Pretty calm area, just sightseeing around if you take a boat ride along the river. Take some photography or just rest and enjoy watching the city life scenery, other than that there's nothing much to explore."
,,Superb sights of Singapore skyline by boat,4.0,,"A must visit attraction is the Singapore river front which is well maintained and very lively tourist area. Both side of the river have walkways, restaurants, boat cruise centres and a beautiful skyline that must be locked in your cameras.
Many points like the Riverfront, Clerke Quay, Marina bay etc have cruise centres from where one can board tourist boats that cruise along slowly for you to visualise the beautiful skyline, Heritage buildings, modern high rises, the Marina bay with views of the famous Merlion, the Flower shaped science centre, the very unusual and unique Sands Hotel with a ship shaped structure resting atop three tall buildings, the bay outdoor concert stadium etc. All excellent views that will make you click your camera every five seconds. The round trip takes about half an hour, and every minute is worth it's 18S$ that you pay for the ride.
Better have a seat in open top area of the boat as the structures along the route are very tall and can be viewed and photographed only if can look towards the sky."
,,A walk by the River,4.0,,"In Singapore the River is not really a river any more... The water does not freely flow to the sea, insttead we have a huge lagoon for water entertainment and supplimenting the drinking water. htat aside the river areas of Singapore are filled with charm, interest and obviously the higher prices. I love the quay areas but if your a tourist check the prices and the add-ons, charges for wet wipes 'free peanuts' etc. Don't let this put you off there are some fantastic places here and 98% of the businesses are honest and open, there is always one or two to watch out for. Big steps have been made by the honest trades here to have people ""shop"" the con artists and if licenced they will have that investigated or revoked. Look out for hte large banners at Clark and Boat Quays.

Overall a really good place, I go there maybe once evry couple of weeks or more often if have friends visiting."
,,"Beautiful, Scenic.",5.0,,"Must visit with you loved ones! One of the most serene and attractive place to be! It flows from the Central Area, which lies in the Central Region in the southern part of Singapore before emptying into the ocean"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Singapore,river is the best place that you able o see that great architecture.there are very cheap boats you can see all the city"
,,good place for a photo,3.0,,"Great place for a stroll up and down river to see the waterway that gave Singapore a lifeline in history. Recommended for a sunset visit as the temperatures cool and the pulse of the CBD starts to ease, nice place to chill out by the river and watch the setting sun colour the skies."
,,River Tour,4.0,,"Given its place in the history of Singapore, a tour of the river is one of the things you want to do. While modern buildings overwhelm the banks of the river, you still can get some sense of the history. This is where Sir Stamford Raffles established the original British trading post in Singapore - you'll pass Raffles statue on the river.

The towering office buildings, hotels, restaurants are all impressive. Even the chance to get a waterside view of the Merlion statue - with water spraying from its mouth.

I've done river tours in a variety of cities. I won't say this is the best, but I wouldn't skip it either."
,,NOTHING LIKE NIGHT OR DAY BY THE RIVER,5.0,,"Singapore's Quays and opportunities to sightseeing, eat, drink and be happy are plenty. From Clarke's Quay step off and walk past the many pleasures and tastes the vibrant part of the city can offer. Riverside bars and restaurants are a plenty with budget and taste suitable for most visitors."
,,Needs clean up,3.0,,"River is muddy and needs cleaning up. The view is rather good especially at night. If taking river taxis, make sure to stop in front of the merlion and take pictures."
,,More like a stream,1.0,,"Rather soul-less for a river, after you consider what the possibilities are for the many rivers of the world. Down-river in the bay area there are still things to see... go up-river and it meanders in the private housing areas and narrows to a stream."
,,Culture and Modern,4.0,,"This is where culture meets modern city. Important in the old era and an icon in the modern Singapore. It's usually very clean, except when it rains it becomes quite muddy. The banks are awesome and a boat trip down the rver and into the merlion park etc. is quite asight."
,,Once the Pulse of the city,5.0,,"The Singapore river was where Singapore all began, Raffles first set foot on its bank. There are many great sites and lots of hstory along the river. There are now great restaurants and bars dotted along the river bank.. great place to hang out both"
,,Cleanliness is a plus,5.0,,"anyone would class the river excellent if he/she had been through the days when it stinks so bad, if I splash you with a few drops of the river water, you will stink for the next few weeks. Now, the river spells beauty and modernisation. Marking a cross on the spot where Raffles once landed first would seem as tough as getting your mother-in-law to stop nagging in the backseat, but it's complimented by exorbitant high rise giants that turn this once filthy stream into GOLD. Well done."
,,"Lively Singapore River, Lifeblood of the early colony",4.0,,"The river is lively and has a few sections to explore. The mouth of the river is where the Esplanade Theatres are, the Merlion Park, the Singapore Flyer, the Marina Barrage, Marina Bay Sands, etc and has been done up very nicely. The river cruise also has a terminus here and is recommended.

A little upstream finds the commercial heart of Singapore where the banks are. The Asian Civilizations Museum, the Arts House (former Parliament House), Victoria Memorial and Concert Hall are also worth exploring. The landing site of Sir Stamford Raffles - founder of modern Singapore - is marked by a statue of the man himself.

Following the river further is Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay. All have many eateries with slightly different characteristics. Boat Quay is more of a watering hole for the business set of the pub crawlers; Clarke Quay is more family orientated and also boasts the reverse bungee ride. The river cruise also stops here. Robertson Quay is a bit more residential as the condominiums are sited here. Along this stretch are many bridges that span the river with the standouts being Anderson (part of the F1 circuit), Cavenaugh (now a pedestrian bridge with an interesting sign posted at either end and sculptures too) and the colorful Alkaff. The current Parliament House and the colourful Ministry of Information, Culture and the Arts (MICA) can also be seen from the banks."
,,AMAZING ATTRACTION IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"The moment our Flight started descending over the Changi Airport,I had a glance of the Singapore River.Later during my city tour of Singapore,visited this great historical attraction.The Singapore River is generally visited by all the tourists to Singapore and the sight of lots of cruise boats no doubt adds glamour to it.The River greatly contributes to the sea trade of Singapore and also a great tourist attraction.The River has its mouth at the Marina Bay.

A must visit for all those who travel to Singapore."
,,history flowing through the river,4.0,,"You'll know more about the country's earliest civilization just by walking or cruising to this river. And it is totally free. If you ever get hungry or thirsty, there are plenty of food stalls nearby and some drinks kiosks."
,,Living history of Singapore,5.0,,"This is where the life of Singapore begins ...the statue of Stamford Raffles, the Asian Civilisation Museum which used be an immigration centre...and many more.."
,,watertaxi,4.0,,short and sweet take the river taxi cruise from merlion park all the way to clarke quay it was fun and slow in a hectic trip with my friends. the boat was fashioned to look old but it was new and very neat
,,Cleanliness city and river,5.0,,This is the great city for walking around for attraction. The river water is clean and look throught to the deep. You can buy the ticket for the boat trip down Singapore River. On the boat you can look in to the wonderful new and old buildings. There are alot of Pubs in the bot sides of the river.
,,A Walk down Singapore River Memory Lane,5.0,,"Went down to Singapore River for a Walk and photography trip. Line both side are pub and more pub at Boat Quay and Clerk Quay. But many may not know, the history of these two area. It used to be warehouse owned by merchants and business. The structure of these warehouses are still there but was converted in a PUB.

What's more Singapore River is turn into a reservoir in the City"
